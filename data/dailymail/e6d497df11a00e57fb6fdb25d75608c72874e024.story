Out there in celebrity land, in the mink-lined nurseries of the filthy rich, a new breed of fearsomely spoilt children are being raised by their fearsomely spoilt parents.

These indulged tots are hatched into a world where budgets have no bounds and reality is a misty blur on the ever-golden horizon.

Look at them. They are in furs before they are five, Chanel before six and in bed by seven. And while dressed in the finest of clothes, they eat in the best restaurants, are entertained like emperors and hot-housed in luxury that would make a sultan blush.

Meanwhile, the gruesome irony of being given designer shoes before they can walk and expensive birthday parties before they can talk seems to be lost on their crazed, doting, cash-scattering parents.

First birthday bling: Tama Ecclestone's little girl Sophia

Thank goodness the tots always have a gem-encrusted rattle to hand, perhaps to shake at the folly of it all.

Take Tamara Ecclestone. You can always depend on Tams to raise the pamper bar to hitherto unheard of heights of deluxe lunacy — and this week she did not let us down. The 30-year-old daughter of Formula One billionaire Bernie Ecclestone and her husband, Jay Rutland, have just returned from a holiday in Italy to celebrate his birthday.

Before their next holiday, they had the small matter of celebrating daughter Sophia’s first birthday this week — and Tamara was determined it was an event that would never be forgotten.

Not by Sophia, who is too young to have a coherent thought running through her gorgeous little head. But by everyone else who goggled at the £70,000 or so spent on turning the front courtyard of their London home into Sophia’s very own petting zoo, complete with puppies, Shetland ponies and a baby zebra.

A rather glum-looking zebra, to be honest, but in terms of competitive party-throwing, the little critter certainly earned his stripes. There was also a real live princess, complete with a wimple, and a platoon of security men delivering gift-wrapped presents for the lucky baby. In pride of place was a rather garish gazebo made entirely of pink balloons with Sophia’s initials picked out in white.

As well as a petting zoo with puppies, Shetland ponies and a baby zebra, Sophie was also lucky enough to have a decadent princess palace created out of pink and white balloons

If you have ever wondered what a doctor would see while performing liver surgery on Mr Blobby, wonder no more.

Tamara also posted photographs on social media of Sophia enjoying her birthday breakfast in her couture pyjamas, surrounded by giant soft toys and a whispering forest of helium balloons. Another gift, wrapped with a pink velvet ribbon, awaited her perusal on her high chair tray.

What and who was all this lavish fuss for? Certainly not for the child, who would have been as puzzled as the zebra about what was going on. However, events like this somehow seem to be more about making an affluent statement than celebrating a birthday.

That’s not to say Tamara is not a lovely mother. Her utter joy and delight in her baby is clear for all to see. Yet one wonders what will happen to all these poor little rich kids, barely out of the crib before they are bombarded by all the good things in life — and then some.

This torrent of luxury is supplied by no doubt well-meaning parents who seem not to know the meaning of restraint, the value of a pound or the concept of modesty.

Few of them have ever had to worry where the next million is coming from and sometimes there is the uncomfortable thought that children are just another accessory, a toy to pamper, a blank canvas upon which they can express how very, very rich they are and how very, very different their lives are from ours.

A few years ago, women like Paris Hilton indulged themselves by carrying around teacup dogs in their handbags; now we have the likes of Kim Kardashian dressing her little girl North West — she wasn’t even given the dignity of a decent name — as a mini-me version of herself. And you don’t have to look far to see where Tamara found inspiration for her sumptuous birthday party.

Last year North — the child of Kim and her husband, the rapper Kanye West — had a first birthday party themed on California’s annual Coachella rock festival.

There was a karaoke stage, a Ferris wheel, a groovy three-tier birthday cake decorated with tie-dyed icing — and a very confused little birthday girl herself, togged out in hippie fringes and a headband.

Not only was Sophia treated to a fancy birthday breakfast in couture pyjamas but she even had a real zebra attend her first birthday party

Elsewhere, Jay-Z and Beyonce gave their daughter Blue Ivy a horse for her second birthday. Not just any old nag or cute Shetland pony. Blue Ivy was given a full blood Arabian stallion — and you don’t get many of them for sixpence.

‘Blue expressed an interest in having a horse,’ said an insider, explaining why Mr and Mrs Z went to such extravagant lengths.

Did she really? The kid probably just shouted ‘Horsey-horsey!’ at something on the TV — and the rest is birthday history. What on earth are they going to do if she shows an interest in dinosaurs?

The Beckhams — perhaps the UK’s answer to the Kardashians — once spent a spent a six-figure sum on building son Brooklyn a brick castle playhouse, complete with drawbridge and tower, at their old Beckingham Palace estate, just outside London.

For daughter Harper’s first birthday, they bought her Damien Hirst’s Daddy’s Girl painting costing £600,000. The pink heart-shaped artwork, complete with butterflies, now hangs in her bedroom, squeezed in beside her designer wardrobe of gorgeous kidult clothes.

The Beckham children, particularly little Harper, always look like they have stepped off a kiddie Milan catwalk — but what else are rich, fashion-conscious millionaire parents going to spend their money on?

At least they are beautifully turned out — and genuinely look like a loving, well-adjusted family. Somehow they have negotiated their way through the wealth maze with sense — not everyone is quite so smart.

When the singer J.Lo and her then partner Marc Anthony had twins, their godfather Tom Cruise threw a ‘welcome to the world’ party for them. The bash cost more than £100,000, not including the diamond rattles he gave them as gifts.

And there is no shortage of excess with his own daughter Suri, the child he had with ex-wife Katie Holmes. Suri was wearing high heels before she went to school and has a wardrobe of designer clothes that would make Naomi Campbell jealous.

When her parents split in 2012, her father bought her a mansion in Manhattan. Not a place for Suri, now eight, to live, but as a kind of luxury warehouse to stash and store all the presents and toys he has bought for her over the years.

As a temple to parental excess, it has no peer.

Still, the new breed of wealthy celebrities are hardly going to be counting out the Maltesers and wondering if they have buttered enough Marmite sandwiches for their darling little one’s birthday party, are they? The impulse of any parent to spoil children and give them the best is understandable — but some extravaganzas go too far.

Once upon a time, in a world long gone, a child’s birthday party was a simple affair. Sandwiches and cake, balloons and Smarties, musical chairs and then home before bedtime.

Younger readers may be astonished by this, but we didn’t even get a party bag. If you got a clip on your ear on your way out the door, you would consider yourself lucky.

Look at these children, as the diamonds rain down on their tiny shoulders and zebras clop up to their front doors. It might be fun for the doting parents to show off and bask in all the luxury — but what chance do these children have of growing up normally, with even a faint grasp of reality?

Answers on a birthday card, please. An expensive one.
