Once nicknamed the ‘slave bracelet’, its design is rumoured to have been based on the medieval chastity belt into which men would lock their wives when they went to war. 

Yet this has done nothing to stop the rise of the bangle that has become the latest must-have trinket for a new generation of celebrities.

The Cartier Love bracelet has graced the wrists of Hollywood actresses Lindsay Lohan and Katie Holmes, while last week Pippa Middleton was spotted in Cartier’s Bond Street store getting her 18-carat gold bangle replaced.

The Cartier Love bracelet was launched in 1969 and was designed to be given to one's true love and screwed on to their wrist for all eternity

Chloe Green, the daughter of Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green, has no fewer than six, often wearing several at the same time.

The upmarket jeweller, a favourite of the Duchess of Cambridge, launched its Love bangles in 1969. The bracelet was designed to be given to one’s true love and then screwed on to their wrist for all eternity.

It consists of two C-shaped halves which are then secured using two working screws on either side.

It is understood that 31-year-old Pippa, who is in a relationship with financier Nico Jackson, had lost or misplaced her original bangle when the screws came loose.

A replacement screw costs as much as £245, while the bracelets themselves range from £4,450 to an eye-watering £39,900 for bespoke designs inlaid with diamonds – making them a powerful status symbol on a par with a Rolex watch.

It is understood Pippa was so upset by the loss of her bracelet, she went straight to the brand’s Bond Street store to buy another one. According to a source, her replacement was a gift from the company.

Cilla Black was lucky too when her Love bracelet – given to her by her late husband Bobby – was one of the pieces burglars left behind when they raided her home.

Tom Cruise bought an 18-carat gold Love bracelet as a ‘push present’ for his then wife Katie Holmes on the birth of their daughter Suri in 2006.

Meanwhile, actress Elizabeth Hurley, who was then the face of Estee Lauder, was presented with one of the bracelets by the firm’s boss Leonard Lauder as a token of his affection.

The bracelet, which this year celebrates its 45th birthday, was created by Cartier’s Italian designer Aldo Cipullo. He started working there in 1969, producing his iconic Love bracelet the same year.

Cipullo had been fascinated by history and often produced work around legends and old practices.

He was particularly interested in the story of men locking up their wives with iron chastity belts to ensure their fidelity while they were away on the battlefield. The designer is thought to have adopted the idea of being locked in a committed relationship in his Love bracelet design.

In an interview at the time, Cipullo said: ‘Love has become too commercial, yet life without love is nothing – a fat zero. What modern people want are love symbols that look semi-permanent – or, at least, require a trick to remove. After all, love symbols should suggest an everlasting quality.’

When the bracelets were launched, Cartier enforced a rule that customers were not allowed to buy one for themselves. They could only make a purchase for somebody else – however, that is a rule that has since been abolished.

Cartier presented the bangles to 25 well-known couples including, rather ironically, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, at a ceremony in its boutique in New York.

Each couple locked each other in before exchanging screwdrivers. To ensure that they were authentic to the last, Cartier last year lent the BBC a pink-gold Love bracelet, set with four diamonds, for its 2013 film Burton and Taylor starring Dominic West and Helena Bonham Carter.

Soon Cartier found it could not keep up with production.

Love bracelets were spotted on the wrists of Nancy and Frank Sinatra and later Joan Collins, Princess Diana, Jane Seymour, Elton John and more recently Jennifer Aniston, Angelina Jolie and model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.

The Precious Love bracelet with diamonds was launched in 1979 followed by the Love ring, Love cufflinks and Love earrings. At one point the bracelet was so well known that it became a measure of one’s commitment. Asking one’s beau if he loved you enough to buy the Cartier Love bracelet was on a par with an engagement.

Cartier currently lists 16 lockable bracelets on its website. Its classic design comes in yellow, pink or white gold, while more intricate designs feature yellow and pink sapphires, garnets and amethysts.

The bracelets have appeared on the lists of top auction houses include Christie’s and Bonhams.

In 1998, two gold Cartier bracelets belonging to the Duke of Windsor and Wallis Simpson were among the items in the 1998 Sotheby’s auction of the Royals’ private collections. The auction famously made more than three times the estimated value.

Not that the bracelets are always for eternity. Tamara Ecclestone returned two diamond-encrusted Love bracelets she had bought for her then boyfriend Omar Khyami when he cheated on her in 2012.

Mr Khyami had claimed a tape showing him in bed with another woman had been made before he met the daughter of Formula 1 billionaire, Bernie. But sources close to Miss Ecclestone believed she had ‘absolute proof’ this was not the case after spotting Mr Khyami wearing the two bracelets in the film.

Others who are having second thoughts about being shackled to another needn’t worry. The bracelet can be removed using a special mini screwdriver which handily comes with every purchase.
