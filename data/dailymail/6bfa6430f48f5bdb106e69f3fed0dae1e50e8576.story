The Republican-controlled Senate on Thursday approved a bipartisan bill to construct the Keystone XL oil pipeline, defying a presidential veto threat and setting up the first of many battles with the White House over energy and the environment.

The 62-36 vote advanced a top priority of the newly empowered GOP, and marked the first time the Senate passed a bill authorizing the pipeline, despite numerous attempts to force President Barack Obama's hand on the issue. 

Nine Democrats joined with 53 Republicans to back the measure, which would take the decision on whether to build the pipeline out of the Oval Office.

Still the vote was short of the threshold needed to override a veto, and the legislation still must be reconciled with the version the House passed.

Now Republican leaders in the House of Representatives have to determine whether they will vote on the Senate bill or launch a conference committee to hash out differences with a similar bill they passed a few weeks ago.

'I'd like to congratulate Leader McConnell for passing this bill in an open, inclusive and bipartisan way,' House Speaker John Boehner said after the vote.

'After dropping his scheme to tax middle-class college savings, we hope President Obama will now drop his threat to veto this common-sense bill that would strengthen our energy security and create thousands and thousands of new, good-paying American jobs.'

Obama's State Department has put at 42,000 the number of jobs the Keystone project would create in the U.S., and declared that the environmental impact would be negligible.

Boehner's jab about college savings referred to a White House plan to taxSection 529 college savings plans in order to pay for a universal guarantee of free community college tuition.

The Obama administration abandoned the idea this week. 

Keystone, if it's built according to plan, would carry more than 1 million barrles of oil each day to refineries in the southen United States, mostly from Canada. 

This bill 'is an important accomplishment for the country,' said Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

The Obama administration has focused its condemnation of the project on the contention that Canada, whose tar sands oilfields would mark the pipeline's starting point, would be the only beneficiary.

But oil from several northern U.S. states would also flow through Keystone.

Obama spoke in Cushing, Oklahoma in March 2012, acknowledging that America is producing 'so much oil and gas in places like North Dakota and Colorado that we don’t have enough pipeline capacity to transport all of it.'

Sen. John Hoeven of North Dakota, who shepherded the Keystone legislation through the Senate, complained that Obama had 'delayed this important infrastructure project for more than six years.'

'The will of the American people and Congress is clear. I encourage the president to sign this legislation and work with us,' he said.

His fellow North Dakota senator, Democrat Heidi Heitkamp, was one of the nine who crossed from left to right to pass the bill.

'Supporting projects, like the Keystone pipeline that are in the best interest of our energy, economic, and national security,' she said in a statement.  

'It’s imperative that we pass the Keystone pipeline, and move on so we finally talk about what the larger energy strategy for our country.'

Most Republicans – and some Democrats – see Keystone as a jobs and infrastructure bill of the type Obama often urges them to back.

'The president has called on Congress to pass bipartisan infrastructure projects, and soon he will have the opportunity to sign one into law,' said Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn.

Democrats view the Canada-to-Texas pipeline project as a potential environmental despoiler and a needless sop to fossil fuel producers

Democrats framed the bill as gift to a foreign oil company that would have little benefit for the American people, because much of the oil would be exported. 

They tried and failed to get amendments on the bill to construct the pipeline with U.S. steel, ban exports of the oil and the products refined from it, and protect water resources.

The Senate agreed to add an energy efficiency measure, and went on the record saying climate change was not a hoax and the oil sands should be subject to a tax that helps pay for oil spill cleanups. 

Oil sands are currently exempt.

COMPLAINING ON THE MARGINS: Democrats (L to R) Chuck Schumer of New York, Maria Cantwell of Washington and Debbie Stabenow of Michigan obected to the failure of their amendments which would have put conditions on the pipeline's construction

'This bill is a disgrace,' said Sen. Barbara Boxer, the top Democrat on the Senate environment committee. 'We tried on our side to make this a better bill and they turned us away.'

First proposed in 2008, the $8 billion pipeline project has been beset by delays in Nebraska over its route and at the White House, where the president has resisted prior efforts by Congress to force him to make a decision. 

In 2012, Obama rejected the project after Congress attached a measure to a payroll tax cut extension that gave him a deadline to make a decision. The pipeline's developer, TransCanada Corp., then reapplied.

Obama has said he will not be forced to make a decision on the pipeline, which requires presidential approval because it crosses an international border, until the review process concludes. 

Federal agencies' comments on whether the project is in the national interest are due Monday.

'The president is out of excuses,' South Dakota Sen. John Thune said Thursday.

Environmental groups have called on Obama to reject the project outright, saying it would make it easier to tap a dirty source of energy that would exacerbate global warming. 

Friends of the Earth, a moneyed green group, called Hoeven's bill 'doomed.'  

The State Department's analysis, assuming higher oil prices, found that shipping oil by rail or tankers would be worse for the planet.
