Every morning Sportsmail brings you the biggest gossip and headlines on the continent, giving you your early morning fix from the biggest leagues across Europe. 

In Spain, Mundo Deportivo celebrate Dani Alves’ 300th game for Barcelona with a picture of the Brazilian holding a commemorative shirt while showing off his many tattoos.

AS note how Sergio Ramos could be Real Madrid’s emergency right-back against city rivals Atletico on Saturday, with Dani Carvajal out injured for the vital clash.

Real face Atletico for the fourth time in eight games, and are looking for a boost after losing 4-2 to Real Sociedad on August 31 after being 2-0 up.

Marca reports Carlo Ancelotti and Diego Simeone will use the same starting line-ups for the team that won the European Super Cup and Spanish Super Cup respectively, but Los Blancos will be forced to use Alvaro Arbeloa instead of Carvaja.

Sami Khedira has also undergone an operation for his left knee. The German was already sidelined as he was recovering from a left hamstring injury sustained last month.

The European champions have not said how long they expect Khedira to be out for. The 27-year-old tore a right knee ligament last November and didn't play until May, returning just in time to feature in the World Cup.

In Italy, Gazzetta dello Sport say Juventus are in trouble with Arturo Vidal potentially out for Juventus’ trip to Milan on September 20, while Corriere dello Sport have a piece on Zaza, calling him the ‘ex-fatty’.

Tuttosport also say the alarm bells are ringing at Juventus with Carlos Tevez also announced as injured on Wednesday.
