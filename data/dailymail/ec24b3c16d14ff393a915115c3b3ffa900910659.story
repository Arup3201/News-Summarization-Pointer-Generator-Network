An apple a day may reduce the risk of heart attack

We may not have taken mum's homespun advice seriously when we were younger, however increasing evidence now suggests that some of her nuggets of so-called wisdom may contain more than a grain of truth, especially when it comes to our health.

Earlier this month researchers at Yale University found that avoiding a cold could be as simple as wrapping up when you venture out in winter, just as your mother always told you.

A cold virus typically enters through the nose. In a study of mice, the researchers found that the immune response was greater if the nose temperature was 37c (body temperature) compared with 33c, and concluded that a scarf over the nose could help ward off illness.

Here are some other health mantras you might have dismissed as silly, but which contain important advice for our wellbeing.

AN APPLE A DAY KEEPS THE DOCTOR AWAY

An apple a day may reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke by 12 per cent, and could be as effective as a statin, according to researchers from Oxford University.

This may be because apples are high in soluble fibre which prevents cholesterol build-up in the arteries, says Helen Bond of the British Dietetic Association.

The fruit also contain antioxidants including flavanoids which help the immune system. Research by the University of Ulster also suggests high levels of substances in apples called phenols may also have a beneficial effect on colon cancer cells.

And a U.S. study shows that quercetin, abundant in apples, may help to prevent prostate cancer by preventing the growth of early cancer cells.

Chilling of the body surface, especially the feet, can cause cold symptoms

THE RAIN CAN TRIGGER A COLD

Being wet and cold can raise your risk of a cold, suggests research from Cardiff University. Volunteers were asked to plunge their feet into bowls of icy water for 20 minutes, while a control group put their feet into an empty bowl.

During the next four or five days, almost one-third of the chilled volunteers developed cold symptoms compared with just 9 per cent in the control group.

Professor Ron Eccles, of the university's Common Cold Centre, says: 'Chilling of the body surface, especially the feet, can cause cold symptoms to appear in someone who is already harbouring the virus.' Why this happens is unclear, but one theory is that getting cold causes the body to restrict blood supply to the extremities - including the nose - to preserve core body temperature.

This results in a cold nose, which leaves us more prone to infection.

MORNING SICKNESS BAD? IT'S A GIRL

A study by the University of Washington found that pregnant women who were hospitalised for nausea and vomiting for three days or more were 80 per cent more likely to have a girl than the control group. Scientists suspect this may be because the mothers' bodies produced increased amounts of a pregnancy-related hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin, which is thought to in some way trigger nausea.

Higher levels are associated with a female foetus.

AND... BANANAS MAKE BOYS

eat bananas if you want a son - that was the suggestion from research by Oxford University, which linked a high potassium intake around breakfast time to the greater chance of having a boy.

From a sample of 740 mothers, the researchers found those who ate a banana every day had a 56 per cent chance of having a boy, compared with 45 per cent on a separate diet.

One banana contains about 422 mg of potassium - around 13 per cent of the body's daily requirement. The mineral is needed to control the balance of fluids in the body, though scientists are still unsure how this could affect the sex of a foetus.

COUNT SHEEP TO HELP YOU SLEEP

The trick is not to count sheep up to 100 as that makes the mind work too hard

Doing something dull and boring will give you the so-called 'quiet mind' - one not disturbed by thoughts or worries - needed to help you drop off, says independent sleep expert Dr Neil Stanley.

'The trick is not to count them up to 100 as that makes the mind work too hard,' he says.

'Instead count the same two or three sheep going in and out of a gate. That should stop you thinking about things that keep you awake, such as paying bills.'

CLOVES STOP TOOTHACHE

Cloves and clove oil contain eugenol, which has anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antioxidant and anaesthetic properties. However, London-based dentist Dr Charlie Ferber advises using this treatment sparingly. He says: 'It may give temporary relief, but applying clove oil to the gums can burn and lead to ulcers. So dab it on, and make sure you see your dentist as soon as possible.'

Carrots are a rich source of beta-carotene, which the body converts into vitamin A

EAT CARROTS TO SEE IN THE DARK

Carrots are a rich source of beta-carotene, which the body converts into vitamin A. 'Vitamin A is needed for good night vision,' explains Andrew Lotery, professor of ophthalmic surgery at the University of Southampton.

'What we don't know is how many carrots you would have to eat to make that improvement.'

Researchers at the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam also found that eating high levels of beta-carotene - the compound that gives carrots their colouring - as well as vitamins C, E and zinc, lowers the chance of age-related macular degeneration (the leading cause of blindness in the UK) by up to 35 per cent. Other sources of beta-carotene include pumpkins, sweet potatoes, pink grapefruit and spinach.

DON'T EAT FOOD OFF THE FLOOR

Food that's been on the floor picks up bacteria - but if you pick it up just a few seconds after being dropped, it's less likely to contain bacteria than if left for longer periods of time, according to the findings of research carried out at Aston University last year.

The study monitored the transfer of E. coli and staphylococcus aureus from a variety of indoor floor types (carpet, laminate and tiled surfaces) to toast, pasta, biscuit and a sticky sweet.

The food was left on the floor for different lengths of time, from three to 30 seconds.

The results showed time is a significant factor in the transfer of bacteria from a floor surface to a piece of food.

The type of flooring the food has been dropped on has an effect, with bacteria least likely to transfer from carpeted surfaces and most likely to transfer from laminate or tiled surfaces.

CHICKEN SOUP EASES A COLD

It's a traditional home remedy – and one that works. Research in the American Journal of Therapeutics found that one compound found in chicken - carnosine -helped the body's immune system to fight the early stages of flu.

Furthermore, Dr Stephen Rennard, of the University of Nebraska, discovered the soup may reduce inflammation during a cold, easing the symptoms of coughing and sneezing.

And according to Professor Ron Eccles, the combination of the heat of the soup with the salt and spices will promote production of saliva, which will help loosen and thin mucus to relieve a blocked nose.

He added that garlic will also help as it has anti-viral and anti-bacterial properties.

If you don't have chicken soup, simply having a hot drink can help, according to previous research led by Professor Eccles.

The study compared the effects of an apple and blackcurrant cordial when drunk either hot or at room temperature by 30 volunteers with cold symptoms.

Within 15 minutes symptoms such as a sore throat, sneezing, cough and runny nose were reduced in those who had the hot drink.

CHEWING GUM CAN BLOCK YOUR GUT

Swallowing the occasional piece of chewing gum is unlikely to cause problems.

But if you are a regular user who swallows their gum every time you have it, the pieces could stick together and cause a painful blockage known as a bezoar, explains Vishal Saxena, a consultant gastroenterologist at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in London.

Bezoars normally pass out through the gut. If not, surgery or medication is required.
