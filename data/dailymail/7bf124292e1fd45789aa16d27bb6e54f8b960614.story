Nearly 100,000 people have signed a petition calling for the Spanish health minister to resign over her order to put down the beloved pet dog of the nurse who beat Ebola.

Teresa Romero Ramos survived the deadly virus after she became the first person to contract it outside Africa while treating two infected missionaries.

However, while she and her husband were in quarantine, Spanish authorities put down the family dog Excalibur on October 8 - claiming it could have spread the disease.

Anger: Nearly 100,000 people have signed a petition calling for the Spanish health minister to resign over her order to put down Exclaibur,  the beloved pet dog of nurse Teresa Romero Ramos who survived Ebola

Excalibur's death provoked widespread protest among animal rights groups, with angry demonstrators taking to the streets of Madrid, calling for the resignation of the country's health minister Ana Mato. 

Now campaign group Partido Animalista, or PACMA, have presented a petition signed by nearly 100,000 people to the Spanish parliament urging her to quit, along with Madrid health officials Javier Rodriguez and Julio Zarco.

However, the Spanish government have rejected the petition and she will remain in office.

Mrs Romero Ramos, 44, who was placed in quarantine on October 6 after her Ebola diagnosis, has described learning of the death of her pet as the worst part of her ordeal.  

The animal was put to sleep inside Mrs Romero Ramos’s home, which was disinfected before the animal’s body was taken away in a white van to a nearby incinerator.

The decision to put down Excalibur, without testing the animal to see whether it was infected, caused widespread protests.

Demonstrators who mounted a vigil outside to try to stop the move shouted ‘murderers’ and several threw themselves on the ground as the vehicle left.

Some 300,000 people had already signed a petition urging authorities to spare Excalibur.

Twitter was awash with photographs of dogs, cats and birds which were posted alongside the hashtag 'SalvemosAExcalibur' – Spanish for 'Let's save Excalibur'. 

'Teresa's dog Excalibur was sacrificed despite the opposition of her owners, thousands of citizens and experts, without evening knowing if it has been infected (with Ebola) and knowing that there are no studies which show that Ebola can be transmitted from dogs to humans,' Pacma said in a statement, according to news website The Local. 

Many people in Spain felt that the dog's demise was a reflection of how the country's authorities handled Mrs Romero Ramos's disease, with a string of mistakes by health co-ordinators.

Mrs Romero Ramos caught Ebola after treating Spanish missionary Manuel Garcia Viejo, 69, who died on September 25 after being infected with the disease while he treated patients in Sierra Leone.

She has admitted touching her face with her gloves as she took off a protective suit after leaving the room of one of the priests.

Ms Mato initially faced calls for her resignation after it emerged that Mrs Romero Ramos had complained of feeling unwell six days before she was eventually admitted to hospital.

She was rushed to hospital by unprotected paramedics in a normal ambulance only taken out of service 12 hours later and found out she had Ebola by reading a Spanish newspaper website as she waited to be quarantined.

Her home in Alcorcon, near Madrid, that she shares with husband Javier Limon Romero who was also quarantined, was not disinfected until October 8, two days after her diagnosis.

Another 13 people who had come into contact with her for 21 days - the incubation period for the disease - though all have now been cleared.

Recovery: Mrs Romero Ramos was treated with a drip of human serum containing antibodies from Ebola sufferers who had survived the disease

Query: At a news conference last week, her husband Javier Limon Romero questioned why the decision had been taken, saying the animal had not been to blame 'for anything'

Mrs Romero Ramos was treated with a drip of human serum containing antibodies from Ebola sufferers who had survived the disease, and other drugs which a government spokesman declined to name. 

Mrs Romero Ramis said: 'The worst part was in regard to my dog. Now I'm going to get a puppy. A little Excalibur.'

Mrs Romero has tested negative for the infection twice in the last week, with 48 hours between each test, but will remain in hospital in Madrid as a precaution until she is fully recovered.

Speaking about her recovery, she added: 'I feel newborn, that is how I feel. I have had a very hard time. I told [my family] I was feeling very bad.

'I told them that I was sick, that I was feeling awful. But I also told them to stay calm.

'What they do is to cheer me up. They tell me they are longing to take off their protective suits to hug and kiss me.

'They cheer me up constantly and ask my what I need all the time. I am thankful to death for them.'

At a news conference last week, her husband questioned why the decision had been taken, saying the animal had not been to blame 'for anything'.

Earlier this week he described the animal as 'the son we never had', and adding that authorities had given him no chance to argue against the decision.

In the U.S. a dog belonging to a nurse infected with Ebola was quarantined and tested negative, before being released.
