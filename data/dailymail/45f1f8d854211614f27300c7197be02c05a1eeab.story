Happy and healthy: Joanna, cycling world record holder and Olympic hopeful

After winning gold at the cycling world cup, millions of TV viewers watched as Joanna Rowsell threw off her helmet and stood proudly on the podium to collect her medal.

With her bald head uncovered, the 23-year-old Olympic hopeful had no idea she would become an overnight ‘poster girl’ for alopecia sufferers.

Indeed, after losing her long auburn locks aged just ten, she spent years covering her hair loss under hats and wigs.

But after finding her confidence 
through top-level cycling, she now feels at ease with her condition. In 
fact, she credits the alopecia for creating the determined and tough 
young woman she is today.

Speaking
from her family home in Cheam, Surrey, and wearing her ‘every day’ wig,
she said last night: ‘Now, I cannot imagine my life if I had not had 
alopecia. I don’t know what route I would have taken.

‘It scares me to think I would not have found cycling.

‘The alopecia made me very shy so I stayed in and intensely focused on my homework or that A* in an exam.

‘Working hard was the only thing that 
stopped me from worrying about the future, about whether I would get a 
boyfriend or how I would face getting a job with strangers.

‘Then
cycling came along and I applied the same work ethic. I worked through 
any worries I had about my hair and I focused solely on that. It made me
who I am.’

The first signs of the condition came 
at the age of nine when the hair in one of Miss Rowsell’s eyebrows fell 
out. Within months, she had developed bald patches on her scalp and she 
began to lose eyelashes.

She said: ‘I was gutted. I had been a girl who loved having my long hair in plaits.

‘I remember crying one night to my parents and asking why it was happening. They said they would find someone to fix it.’

Despite seeing numerous doctors, her 
parents, bank worker Roger, 52, and school accounts manager Amanda, 52, 
were told that the alopecia was incurable.

Alopecia occurs when the immune system
becomes confused and attacks the body’s hair follicles. This causes the
hair to fall out leaving bald patches that can eventually spread across
the entire head.

Acceptance: Joanna Rowsell has had alopecia 
areata since she was 10. She currently only has a few patches of hair on
her scalp and decided to opt for the occasional wig when she turned 20

Deterioration: At age 9 with her treasured long hair but one eyebrow missing, by age 11 the alopecia has fully set in

Miss Rowsell said: ‘It was hard being a
teenager and having alopecia. I didn’t bother with make-up or clothes 
because I didn’t want to think about my appearance.’

She credits cycling with boosting her 
confidence. At 15, she was scouted by the British cycling talent team 
when they visited her school in Sutton, Surrey.

At the time she had no interest in 
cycling and only owned an old push bike which was rusting in the back of
her parents’ garage. But they spotted raw talent and she began 
training.

Determination: Joanna cycles her way to victory in the Women's Individual Pursuit at the Olympic Velodrome on Saturday

2009 and gold in the 
European Track Championships in 2011.

Last weekend, she was part of the team
pursuit trio which won gold at the UCI World Cup with a record-breaking
time of three minutes, 18.148 seconds. 

She then had her own win in the 
individual pursuit against former world champion Alison Shanks from New 
Zealand. And she was happy to go without her wig on the podium.

She said: ‘I literally only had time 
to wipe the sweat off my face and jump on the podium. If I have time, I 
will put on one of my wigs because everyone likes to look their best, 
but I will also go without.’

She bought her first wig from Selfridges at the age of 20.

‘I suppose I 
wanted to feel “normal” and attractive on nights out,’ she said.

‘I didn’t want to look silly, but it was
like being in disguise, I loved it. I chose a long black curly wig. Now
I have three, including a long blonde one. It is fun to experiment.’

At the age of 16, her hair grew back – something she credited with her happiness from cycling. She was, she says, ‘over the moon’, but six months later she was devastated when it fell out and she had to go through the trauma of losing hair again. At 20, it grew back for a third time, but lasted one month.

It could not have come at a worse time, having just met her first and current boyfriend. She said: ‘I was so worried when it fell out again that he wasn’t going to like me, but he wasn’t bothered at all.’

Now, she is philosophical about her condition. She said: ‘Much worse things happen in life than losing your hair. I am happy and healthy. Now I want to focus on the things that matter – like getting that gold medal at the Olympics.’
