A man who lost his father when he was only six years old has discovered he is able to play his father's 'ghost' in a racing video game on his Xbox years later.

YouTube user 00WARTHERAPY00 shared a touching story in the comments section of a PBS video called, 'Can Video Games be a Spiritual Experience?'

Ten years after letting his XBOX collect dust, 00WARTHERAPY00 turned on the gaming console and discovered he could play against his father's highest score in 'Rally Sports Challenge,' almost as though his father were there playing with him, reports AOL.

A teenager was able to play against his father's best race in the Xbox game 'Rally Sports Challenge' even after his father had died

00WARTHERAPY00 wrote about how he and his father would always love playing the racing game and that they played it up until the time his father died.

'Well, when I was 4, my dad bought a trusty Xbox. You know, the ruggedy, blocky one from 2001. We had tons and tons of fun playin all kinds of games together--until he died when I was just 6,' he wrote.

00WARTHERAPY00 describes his experience turning on the video game for the first time.'...once i started meddling around... i found a GHOST,' he wrote.

When a player gets a high racing score, that race is recorded and players can race against the fastest car until they beat their high score.

00WARTHERAPY00's father was the last one to gain a high score so he is able to play against his father as many times as he wanted as long as he didn't beat his score.'So i played and played, and played, until i was almost able to beat the ghost. until one day i got ahead of it, i surpassed it, and...- i stopped right in front of the finish line, just to ensure i wouldnt delete it,' wrote 00WARTHERAPY00.

One thing that won't be deleted is his father's memory.
