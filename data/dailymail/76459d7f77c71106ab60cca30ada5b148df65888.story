He's photographed Prime Ministers and global A-listers but Australia's premier celebrity photographer has revealed how it was TV presenter Rachael Finch who blew him away with her 'fearlessness'.

The 26-year-old posed on a huge rearing Australian stock horse for her iconic Channel 7 photoshoot in 2010 photographed by Peter Brew-Bevan, despite only having been on a horse once in her life.

Brew-Bevan, who has worked with Australia’s most famous including Keith Urban, Naomi Watts, Cate Blanchett and Julia Gillard, said his day on set with the former Miss Universe Australia did not go as he expected.

'I expected it not to work. The client gave me a brief with an obscure reference to a 1960s shoot and I thought "oh my god".

'But we were told through research that Rachael had ridden horses before and so I thought she was comfortable on them,' Brew-Bevan told MailOnline.

It wasn’t until the star turned up on set that Brew-Bevan realised he would be making her do a dangerous stunt on a horse when she’d only ridden once before.

'Amazing': Brew-Bevan sung the praises of Jessica Marais and said she has the 'X Factor'

The horse in question was intimidating in stature but highly-trained. Ammo, who died last year, was one of Australia’s most famous stunt horses and so the photographer and Finch quickly committed to making it work.

Ammo’s trainer Steve Jefferys, who famously galloped into the stadium at the Sydney Olympics Opening Ceremony on Ammo, gave Finch a 45 minute training session on the horse.

Next they had to get Ammo comfortable with the elaborate black ball gown Finch was wearing on the promotional shoot for her role as a Channel 7 reporter at the Spring Racing Carnival.

Tricky location: Keith Urban was shot in Kununurra, a town in far northern Western Australia. 'I had to fly three planes in from Sydney and Perth for a four hour shoot,' Brew-Bevan said

'Steve spent an hour rubbing the tulle skirt on the horse’s back so he would get used to the sensation and then we did a few test shots,' Brew-Bevan explained 

And then, astonishingly, he was able to capture the perfect shot as Ammo reared up with Finch gracefully on his back and looking straight at the camera.

'Within one go she did it. She was phenomenal, I never saw anyone be so fearless and this is not a small horse either,' Brew-Bevan said.

Favourite: 'Julia Gillard is great. I had the fortune of shooting her several times through her career and she's just the most down to earth with a wicked sense of humour and insanely intelligent,' Brew-Bevan said

His memorable encounter with Finch is just one of many special moments with Australia's rich and famous over the past 18 years.

But the 45-year-old never intended to become a celebrity portrait photographer, he studied fine art and was originally a landscape painter.

'I discovered photography in my second year of uni. I got into fashion shoots but didn’t really get the craft of it I suppose. And then I started doing portraits for magazines of chefs and everyday people,' he said.

It was around 1994 with the rise of celebrities being used in women’s magazines that he began to be asked to take portraits of stars.  

Describing what he loves about his work he said it is not the chance to meet the famous people necessarily but 'the challenge of trying to create something or bringing a certain aspect of that person out on film that hasn’t been seen before.'

'The bigger the celeb the harder it is to capture something new. I recently shot Cate Blanchett, this woman has been shot thousands of times so it’s challenging to get something new.'

Since he began snapping, Brew-Bevan has photographed Prime Minister Tony Abbott, radio Queen Jackie O, TV’s Samantha Armytage, Rachel Griffiths, Teresa Palmer, Bob Hawke, Jessica Marais, Miranda Otto and many more.

But despite the hundreds of thousands of photos he has taken there are some images that remain firmly lodged in his mind, particularly that of actress Naomi Watts who he shot in Melbourne in 2003. 

The National Portrait Gallery called the Victorian style painting portrait their very own 'Mona Lisa'.

'I captured not only her innate beauty but her fragility. My first thought upon seeing Naomi was... you look like a little child. She is very petite - almost childlike,' Brew-Bevan previously said of the star.

Cover guy: Ricky Martin was photographed in his signature leather jacket

Smart: Author and model Tara Moss tips her hat for the camera

He also can't forget the photo he took of actress Rose Byrne in his Balmain house 'before hair and make-up artists existed' in 1998. 'I would go in and pick the clothing,' he explained.

For Brew-Bevan, the bigger the star the easier they are to work with.

'All the A-listers I work with are a breeze because we're all there with the common cause. We all know it’s our jobs they know it's there jobs to give something,' he said.

He spends time getting to know his subject before photographing them and often forms friendships with the stars that he repeatedly captures.

'It takes a couple of shoots to get that sort of connection,’ he said.

From his experience, Brew-Bevan has learned that some people either have that ‘star quality’ or they don’t.  He said the most natural talent in front of the camera he has discovered so far is actress Jessica Marais.

'Jess was amazing. I found over the years there’s that X Factor that people just have. I don’t know what it is, it’s an energy that they bring and that’s an energy I have to tap into ,’ he explained.

Of all of his logistical nightmares over the years, there is one shoot that stands out as the most difficult and it involves musician Keith Urban in Kununurra, a town in far northern Western Australia.

'It was a cover shoot for a magazine to celebrate a 10 year birthday and he was very agreed to do it but he was in middle of touring the States.

On the couch: David Whenem shot for Women's Weekly magazine

'He was flying in and Nicole Kidman was filming the movie Australia up there.  So we got the OK to do it but the deal was had to shoot it in Kununurra.

'Getting my crew and equipment to the location meant I had to fly three planes in from Sydney and Perth for a four hour shoot.

'It took five days to get there and back. That was the most extreme and I’ve shot all around the world it. But it was worth it, he is a legend, a great cool guy.'

Moving: This photo of Damien Tomlinson was taken in Bondi, Sydney, but Brew-Bevan chose the spot to look like Afghanistan. 'He was an SAS solider who lost his legs in a landmine he drove over... he is one of the most positive amazing men you will ever meet, he is an absolute hero'
