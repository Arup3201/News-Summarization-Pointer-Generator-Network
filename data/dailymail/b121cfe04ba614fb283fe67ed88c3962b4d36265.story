A New York man has pleaded guilty to beating his girlfriend's godson to death.

Jonathan Thompson, of Amityville, New York, punched 4-year-old Adonis Reed so hard in the stomach when the boy refused to take a nap that the youngster died as the result of a lacerated liver.

At the time, Reed was living with his godmother, Lakisha Pitt, who was dating Thompson.

The boy's 6-year-old sister was also living at the house.

Thompson, 34, had confessed to the killing just days after it happened in January of 2013, but in an odd twist was recently suing his former lawyer, and almost every agency connected with the case, claiming a 'clear conspiracy' by all to violate his rights.

In addition to a stay of his trial he was also asking for $500 million.

According to Newsday, the suit also claimed that Reed died not because of the beating he suffered at the hands of Thompson, but rather from 'overzealous resuscitation efforts by first responders and medical malpractice at Good Samaritan Hospital Medical Center in West Islip.'

Beaten to death: Reed was just 4-years-old when he died after suffering fatal injuries to his liver

Anger: Reed's mother Linda Daniel is upset Child Protective Services placed the boy with his godmother since Thompson, who also lived at the house, was a convicted felon

Representing himself, Thompson decided to plead guilty yesterday, just one day before jury selection was set to begin.

He likely changed his mind after medical evidence strongly suggested that the beating caused the death, as opposed to any problems with Reed's medical care. 

Suffolk County Court Judge Barbara Kahn agreed to sentence Thompson to 15 years to life in prison.

The young boy's grandmother, Linda Daniels, said she was happy Thompson pleaded guilty yesterday, but felt his sentence was too lenient.

She was also upset that Suffolk Child Protective Services placed Reed in his godmother's care to begin with and did not do a background check on her felon boyfriend.
