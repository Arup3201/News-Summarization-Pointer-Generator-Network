This seal looks like he's had too many mince pies as it sprawls on the beach with a bulging belly.

The pup is an Atlantic grey seal which lives on Skomer Island just off the Pembrokeshire coast.

It is one of 108 baby seals saved after a cow seal gave birth on the pebble beach and they became trapped in one of the island's caves.

Skomer Warden Eddie Stubbings said: 'The baby seals are a joy to watch but we try not to interfere with them too much - we have to let nature take its course.'

'We have been out with them every day since - even when that hurricane blew up we were on the cliffs checking on the seals.

'Skomer is only a small island so 180 baby seals is a lot to keep an eye on.'

Mr Stebbings rescued the seals when they became trapped and he and his wife have been looking after them ever since.

Skomer, managed by the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales, is one of Britain's most important bird sanctuary islands.
