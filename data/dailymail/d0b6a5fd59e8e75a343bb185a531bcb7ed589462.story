India all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja has been granted the opportunity to appeal against his International Cricket Council fine, for his part in a spat with England's James Anderson during the Trent Bridge Test.

Jadeja was fined half his match fee, a sum thought to be in the region of Â£3,000, after being found guilty of a Level one offence.

It was thought he had no right of appeal, under the ICC's code of conduct, but India's lawyers have successfully argued otherwise.

Jadeja's case will therefore be reconsidered on Friday morning, at the same time as fast bowler Anderson's disciplinary hearing for a more serious Level 3 offence of 'abusing and pushing' his opponent - relating to the same incident as the players made their way off for lunch and into the pavilion stairwell on day two of the first Test in Nottingham.

The hearings will take place in Southampton, the day after the scheduled conclusion of the ongoing third Investec Test, and will be overseen via video-conference by the ICC's Melbourne-based judicial commissioner Gordon Lewis.
