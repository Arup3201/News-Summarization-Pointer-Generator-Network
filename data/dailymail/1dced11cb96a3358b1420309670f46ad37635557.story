Bolton are putting the finishing touches to their bid to lure Kris Commons from Celtic this month – despite Ronny Deila saying they are wasting their time.

Sportsmail understands Bolton chairman Phil Gartside is about to test the resolve of the Parkhead club on the say-so of manager Neil Lennon.

Lennon signed the player to Celtic from Derby in 2011 and has gone public with his desire to be re-united with him in Lancashire this month.

The 31-year-old midfielder is in the final six months of his contract but so far negotiations over a new two-year deal have been fruitless with the sticking point believed to be the appearance-related aspect of the second year.

But not only does Deila feel any approach to take the player from his clutches now will be swiftly rejected, he firmly believes a middle ground in the talks will yet be found.

‘He’s not leaving in January,’ Deila stated. ‘We have to win the league.

‘He’s a good player and we want to keep the best ones.

‘The situation is still the same. We are talking together and will see if something can be agreed.

‘I still think it’s a possibility because we want to keep him and he wants to stay. That’s the most important thing.

‘If I didn’t want him and he didn’t want to stay it would be finished now.’

Commons appeared to be bidding farewell to the Celtic support when he threw his boots to the visiting fans at the end of Saturday’s 2-0 win at Hamilton.

Deila is adamant he doesn’t need to address that matter – simply because the player is going nowhere.

‘I haven’t talked to him about that,’ he added. ‘I’ve only talked to him about his situation which is very clear and we’ll see what’s happening in the next few days.

‘I still think a deal can be done. I haven’t given that up. He still has to perform like we all have to do. It works both ways.

‘He’s a very good players and we’ll see if we can do this for a longer period. 

'The situation is very clear. We want him and he wants to stay. It’s about the contract.

‘It’s hard to say how apart we are but we’re not agreeing. And when you do not agree, you do not agree. So we’ll see but we’re in negotiations so we’ll see what’s happening.’
