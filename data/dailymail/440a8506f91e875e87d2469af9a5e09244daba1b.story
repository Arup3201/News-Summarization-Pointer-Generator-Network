An armless man who steered his car with his feet has had his car confiscated to stop him driving because it’s ‘too dangerous’ – though he’d already clocked up 100,000 miles behind the wheel.

Police in China said Wo Guo, 45, was a danger to himself and other road users.

He was pulled over in a routine road traffic check in Xiantao city in central China’s Hubei province, where officers found he did not have a licence.

Toe-tally incredible: Wo Guo has driven 100,000 miles using his feet 

Banned: Mr Guo has had his car confiscated by police in China

He used his feet to drive the car. He used the big toe and the toe beside it on the left foot to control the steering wheel and used the right foot to control the brake.

According to the armless motorist he has clocked up 100,000 miles without mishap.

Guo lost his arms at the age of seven when he went to cut grass to feed a horse, and accidentally touched high voltage wires with his scythe.

Crucial: Mr Guo says he needs a car to sell fruit

After his arms were amputated he learned to wash his face and brush his teeth, write and to sew using his feet. He is married, has a son who is at college, makes a living selling fruit and says he has a ‘happy life.’

But he says he needs his car to make deliveries: ‘I don't find driving automatic cars hard. My friend taught me to drive within a week, but I can't get a licence because of my disability so I do it in secret.

A police spokesman said that he would not be fined and he would get his car back if he hired a driver, adding: ‘He is admirable, but it’s too dangerous for him to drive. I hope he can give up driving himself and employ someone else.’
