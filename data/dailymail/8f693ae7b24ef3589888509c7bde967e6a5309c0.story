A third of brides regret their choice of wedding dress and would change it if they could turn back time, according to new research.

And that's not all - more than half (52 per cent) would edit the best man's speech if they had the chance to replay it and a third (31 per cent) would choose a different honeymoon destination.

A staggering 82 per cent of brides would alter at least one aspect of their big day if they could - meaning just 18 per cent have the ‘perfect day’ of their dreams.

Do YOU regret yours? A third of brides regret their choice of wedding dress and would change it if they could turn back time, reveals a new survey

The findings come from a new survey of 1,000 women who were asked to list their wedding day regrets.

Some 32 per cent said they ‘cringe’ when they look at their wedding dress and they would definitely choose another dress if they had a chance.

A further 38 per cent would alter the way they did their hair and make-up on their big day.

A third (30 per cent) would swap their wedding photographer, with many brides moaning that ‘their friends’ wedding pictures are better than ours.’

And one in six (17 per cent) would even switch their bouquet for a different floral arrangement.

A quarter of brides (24 per cent) would change their wedding ring - and one in eight would swap their wedding band (13 per cent).

Put the wrong ring on it? A quarter of brides (24 per cent) would change their wedding ring - and one in eight would swap their wedding band (13 per cent)

One in five (21 per cent) would dump at least one of her bridesmaids, whilst 33 per cent would switch the weather on the wedding day if they could.

Four out of ten brides (39 per cent) regret allowing their husband to choose their engagement ring. Even if they are happy with the final ring, brides still wish they’d had more input in the decision.

And just under a third (32 per cent) wish they had spent more on the ring because they have to wear it for the rest of their lives.

The biggest source of marital regret was the best man’s speech. ’Inappropriate jokes’ were the main source of disdain about the best man’s speech - chosen by 34 per cent of brides.

Some brides (12 per cent) even took issue with their own father’s wedding speech - the main objection here being that he forgot some thank-yous.

Other bridal regrets include the overall cost, with 34 per cent of brides wishing they had spent more because ‘it probably won’t happen again’.

And one in six (16 per cent) regret their choice of music, with a poor choice of band being the biggest gripe.

One in ten brides even rues the choice of the song for their ‘first dance’ - ‘too cheesy’ being the main regret.

Style icon Sarah Jessica Parker claims her biggest regret is choosing a black gown for her wedding in 1997.

She wed fellow actor Matthew Broderick, opting for black to avoid unwanted media attention. Yet she told Harper’s Bazaar that she would do it differently now, saying: 'White it up. I’d wear a beautiful, proper wedding dress, like I should have worn that day. Yes, I still regret it.'

Oh no! The biggest source of marital regret was the best man's speech with 'inappropriate jokes' being cited as the main source of disdain

Cate Blanchett has been happily married to playwright Andrew Upton since 1997 but there’s one enduring regret about their big day.

She says: 'The only moment of my life I would possibly recapture is getting remarried again, because we didn’t take any photographs. We didn’t have any money at the time, and we couldn’t afford a photographer.'

Cate was 28 when the fellow Australians wed, her husband was 31.

Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries are now divorced but she had immediate regrets after their wedding ceremony in 2011.

'My one regret at the wedding - and I’m so mad I didn’t think of this - I should’ve had a little box or a stool I stood on. There should have been a little stair, it should have been a little extra stair so I could be a little taller that day.'

The couple’s marriage - when she was 33 and he was 26 - lasted just 72 days, although height difference between the bride and groom wasn’t to blame. Hopefully lessons were learnt before her wedding to Kanye West.

Jeweller Vashi Dominguez, who carried out the survey, said the long list of regrets shows how many brides get it wrong on their big day. 'Most of us only marry once in our lives - why cut corners and skimp on costs?

'What seems to be really expensive today will be like a drop in the ocean in 10 years’ time. We see women every day buying very expensive diamond rings because they don’t like their engagement rings.

'Either 
their circumstances have changed and they can afford a better ring now 
or fashions have changed and they have previously lumbered themselves 
with a ring which looks completely inappropriate a few years after the 
wedding.

'My advice
 to all women preparing for their wedding is to think very carefully 
about the ring because the chances are you won’t get an opportunity to 
change it.

'No one wants to be left wearing an engagement ring for 50 years which they don’t like.'
