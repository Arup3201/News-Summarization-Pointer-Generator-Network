Sports stores are not stocking England's £90 World Cup shirt because staff believe football fans will not buy them.

Since its controversial release last month, critics have said Nike strip which will be worn by the team in Brazil this summer is 'too expensive'.

As a result, chains including JD Sports and Sports Direct have not put them on their shelves because 'people aren't touching them'.

Rip off: England's £90 World Cup shirt has been branded as 'ludicrously expensive' and sports stores say fans simply will not buy them

The Prime Minister has called for the Football Association and merchandisers Nike to 'rethink' the hefty price tag of the shirts.

The £90 shirt is identical to those that will be worn by Roy Hodgson's side.

An adult 'stadium' England shirt, which is made from a different material, is priced 
at £60, while shirts for children aged between eight and 15 cost £42.

A parent wanting to get the full Nike kit – shirt, shorts and socks – for a 12-year-old would have to pay between £71 and £119.

While JD sports sells the stadium shirt online for £55, staff at an outlet in Turrock, Essex, have said the full-priced kit will 'not sell'. 

Labour MP Paul Farrelly, a member of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee, told The Sunday Mirror: 'It's a ludicrously expensive price and people are perfectly free as to whether they pay it or not.'

Nike have backed the choice of the price, saying it represents the research that went into putting the kit together.

The manufacturers claim eight water recycled water bottles go into every shirt and the income from the strip will help promote grass roots football.

JD sports will be stocking the replica shirt closer to the tournament but will be selling it in 'limited numbers.' 

Despite the price tag, the shirt's label reveals the kit is manufactured in Indonesia, where the cost of manufacturing a shirt is alleged to be around £4.

Design: The shirt, which is also available in red, has sparked widespread criticism, but Nike have justified the price tag, because of the amount spent on researching the kit

After their release, Sports minister Helen Grant took to 
Twitter to say: 'On £90 England football shirts for fans, it's not 
right. Loyal supporters are the bedrock of our national game - pricing 
needs a rethink.'

The
kit – in both a white and a red away version – has been launched just 
ten months after the shirts were last changed in May 2013. This appears 
to be at odds with a long-standing convention to protect the pockets of 
fans by changing the national team kit only every two years.

In the mid-2000s replica England shirts were on sale for £30 almost as soon as they were released

The
prices have since risen steeply, but they are dependent on results on 
the field. Following England’s 4-1 defeat to Germany in the 2010 World 
Cup the price for the replica shirts worn in that tournament plummeted.

The row comes 11 years after the FA,
sports retailers and clubs were fined more than £16million for 
colluding to inflate the price of shirts. 

Nike took over the lucrative England kit supply deal from Umbro last year and is paying £25million a while the FA said it has no control over the cost of shirts.
