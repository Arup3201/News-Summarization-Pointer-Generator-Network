Police have arrested three men in dawn raids today over violence at the FA Cup semi-final match between Millwall and Wigan at Wembley Stadium earlier this month.

One of the crown jewels of the English football calendar was marred when fights erupted among the Lions supporters, leaving some fans with bloodied noses and younger ones weeping as they watched fans and officers clash.

Scotland Yard said this morning the men, aged 21, 22 and 27, were arrested at addresses in London by officers from Operation Arrowtip, which targets football-related crime.

Trouble broke out between supporters during the FA Cup Millwall and Wigan Athletic at Wembley Stadium on Saturday April 13

So far 23 people have been arrested in 
relation to violence at the semi-final, during which Millwall fans 
attacked police and fought among themselves inside and outside the 
ground.

Violence escalated after Wigan scored
their winning goal on Saturday April 13, with television pictures showing police heavily 
outnumbered and defending themselves with batons.

Those
not involved let their embarrassment show as they booed the few who 
spoiled what was supposed to be a magical day out for the Championship 
club.

A further 17 pictures have been released of people at the match who police want to speak to. 

Wanted: These are 17 (above and below) football fans suspected of being involved in disorder at the FA Cup semi-final, and police want them identified

Detective Chief Inspector Andy Barnes said: 'Large-scale violence and disorder at football matches is completely unacceptable. People attending matches expect to be able to do so in a safe and friendly environment.

'We have had an excellent response from the public, who have identified people in nine of the 10 images already released. Some have since handed themselves in to police, and to date, we have arrested 23 people. Three have been charged.

'The investigation team is working 
through many more calls and CCTV to identify all those involved in the 
disorder. We expect to make further arrests.

'Our message is clear. Violence at 
football is unacceptable. If you were involved in the violence come 
forward and speak with us. We will pursue all those responsible.'

Bad end: Many fans looked horrified as rows erupted in the stands after the disappointing match for Millwall

Discipline: Police officers wield batons as they attempt to stop supporters fighting amongst themselves during the FA Cup

Anyone with information about the violence or who recognises the people in the pictures is urged to call police on 020 8246 0076 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111.
