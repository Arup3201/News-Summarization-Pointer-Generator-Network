Thirteen people have been injured following a massive explosion at a building in downtown Minneapolis that forced residents to jump from windows.

Six people are in critical condition following the morning blaze. Some of the victims suffered burns, while others suffered trauma as they jumped to the ground from windows on the third floor.

The three-story building, 516 Cedar Avenue, houses a grocery and several apartments - and authorities say they fear residents could still be stuck inside.

Emergency responders received the first reports of the explosion at 8.16am, Minneapolis Fire officials told WCCO, and arrived on the scene within minutes - but after 15 minutes they were forced to evacuate the building due to dangerous conditions.

The firefighters are battling to put out the flames and look for potential victims in freezing conditions - as temperatures plunge to a degree below freezing - raising the danger of hypothermia.

Temperatures were so low that water was freezing as it came out of their hoses, CNN reported.

In addition, floors inside the building have collapsed, making their mission more dangerous.

'These are very treacherous conditions,' Minneapolis Fire Chief John Fruetel said.

CNN reported on Wednesday morning that it
 was not yet clear if the people had jumped from the windows, or if they
 had been pushed as flames engulfed the rooms.

It is not yet known what caused the fire.

Smoke and flames were seen billowing 
out of the windows on Wednesday morning, while nearby residents gathered
 in the streets to watch.

Around 50 firefighters have swarmed the 
scene and at least a dozen people were transported to Hennepin County hospitals.

Chief Fruetel told KMSP that nine of the building's 10 apartment units were occupied, and said he believes victims are still unaccounted for.

'This is a tragic morning for the city of Minneapolis,' Mayor-elect Betsy Hodges said.

A family assistance center will be set up at a nearby community center, and the mayor, mayor-elect and councilman will be on hand to speak with families and neighbors.

Greg Nelson, supervisor of the Minneapolis Emergency Communications Center, said the building is likely a total loss.
