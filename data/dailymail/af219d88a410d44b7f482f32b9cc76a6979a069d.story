There is usually just one party that benefits from divorce proceedings: the lawyer.

But, it seems, they don’t always learn from the bad experiences of others.

In an extraordinary case, two wealthy solicitors spent five years and virtually all their money battling over the terms of their acrimonious split.

Battle: Giles Kavanagh (left) and Anna-Marie Harvey Kavanagh were left with just over £90,000 between them, after years of acrimonious legal disputes over money and their three children

Despite both being practising lawyers,
Anna-Marie Harvey Kavanagh, 47, and her ex-husband Giles Kavanagh, 52, 
‘spent almost all their assets in litigation’ during the lengthy court 
battle.

A judge who had previously presided 
over their case criticised them for ‘wrecking the ship of their 
marriage, then turning their attention to the lifeboats’.

And yesterday, as they returned to the
courts yet again, a different judge said they had ‘tragically’ 
squandered their fortune and had little more than £90,000 left between 
them.

The Kavanaghs, who have three children
together and were married for ten years, lived in a £3.2million 
seven-bedroom home set in half-an-acre in South-West London until their 
split in 2008.

Following the divorce, they spent 
almost £900,000 in a court battle to determine maintenance payments and 
the division of their assets.

Mrs Kavanagh was awarded two thirds 
of the funds raised by the sale of the matrimonial home in 
Kingston-upon-Thames, and her husband a third by a judge in 2008.

But the proceeds of the multi-million 
pound sale – after it is believed a hefty mortgage was repaid – were so 
depleted by a ‘debt of costs’ and other factors, that Mrs Kavanagh 
received just £94,500.

Despite Mr Kavanagh earning more than 
£485,000 a year as a partner in a law firm specialising in aerospace 
litigation and insurance, he was left with ‘net debts’ following the 
court hearings.

Yesterday, the couple returned to 
court before top family judge, Lord Justice McFarlane, to contest the 
level of maintenance payments Mr Kavanagh was ordered to pay to his 
ex-wife.

The judge, sitting at London’s Civil Appeal Court, said that the couple’s expenditure was a ‘tragedy’ for the family’s finances.

He added that Judge Clive Million, 
who had previously presided over the case in the High Court’s Family 
Division, had criticised the couple in his judgment last year.

Criticised: the judge criticised the pair for 'wrecking the ship of their marriage' with their expensive legal battle. The pair lost almost all of their assets and sold their former home, (pictured) during their fight in the courts

He said that the judge had told them: ‘They wrecked the ship then turned their attention to the lifeboats.

‘By 2008 they had spent over £879,000
on legal costs and contested proceedings. Children Act proceedings had 
cost about £545,000.

The financial proceedings cost over 
£303,000 and Family Law Act applications cost another £32,000. The 
disputes and costs have gone on.

‘The ship of marriage may founder, but this couple have driven theirs full-tilt on to the rocks.’

Mrs Kavanagh’s barrister, Jonathan 
Tod, argued that Mrs Kavanagh should receive more maintenance because 
her husband’s pay rises since 2008 had been ‘double the average annual 
wage of a man living in the South East of England’.

Mrs Kavanagh, who receives 
£48,000-a-year, should have the yearly payments increased to between 
£66,000 and £88,000 as she had put her career on hold to raise the 
couple’s children, he said.

Rejecting the plea, Lord Justice McFarlane said the impact of the costs in the case were ‘a catastrophe for this family’.

He said Mr Kavanagh was already 
responsible for paying the school fees for the couple’s three children 
who are all being privately educated at a cost of £36,000-a-year.

‘There is no prospect of an appeal succeeding were the matter to be given permission,’ the judge concluded.

Both parties attended the hearing, although Mr Kavanagh was not represented. Mrs Kavanagh declined to comment afterwards.
