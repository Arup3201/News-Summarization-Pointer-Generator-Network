A Nepalese woman has pulled off the extraordinary feat of climbing Mt Everest TWICE in a single season, reaching the summit just 11 days after her first ascent.

Last night Chhurim Sherpa, 29 – known only as Chhurim – was being lauded as the heroine of Nepal after reaching the 29,035ft peak of the world’s highest mountain twice within the same month.

She beamed with happiness when Nepal’s Tourism Minister, Mr Posta Bahadur Bogati handed over a certificate marking her astonishing victory over the mountain that has claimed hundreds of lives.

Chhurim Sherpa, from Kathmandu, has been described as a 'very brave woman' for climbing to the summit of Everest twice.

Miss Chhurim reached the peak on May 12 last year before returning to base camp for a well-earned rest.

But the call of the mountain overcame any desire to return to her home in the hills to the north east of the capital, Kathmandu – and she repacked her bag, checked over her equipment and set out for the peak again with a different climbing team just over a week later.

'She showed strong willpower and extraordinary zeal,’ said a Himalyan climbing group’s spokesman.

‘She is a very brave woman.’

Mount Everest is the world's highest peak and is the ultimate challenge for professional and amateur climbers

The mountain has always been a formidable challenge for the women Sherpas of Nepal.

The
first local female climber to reach the peak was 32-year-old Pasang 
Lhamu, who accomplished the feat in 1993 but tragedy struck on the 
descent when bad weather moved in and she succumbed to the cold.

Since then 21 other Nepalese women have climbed to the top, but Miss Chhurim is the first to make two ascents in one season.

The
greatest hardship for a woman climber like herself, Miss Chhurim said 
in Kathmandu yesterday, was making the ascent with a team of male 
sherpas.

‘It turns out to be very tough for women like me because there are no toilets,’ she said with a straight face.

‘Five of us had to share a tent – it was a bit awkward.’

Some 3,000 people have reached the top of Mt Everest since Edmund Hillary and sherpa Tenzing Norgay conquered it in 1953.

The 'summit season on Everest begins in late April when a small window between spring and the summer monsoon offers the best conditions for making the climb.

Mount Everest is the world's highest mountain at 8,848 metres, the size of 20 Empire State Buildings.

As of September 2011 over 3,100 climbers from over 20 countries had made over 5,100 recorded climbs.

Over 200 people have died attempting the climb.

Forms part of the Himalaya mountain range, straddling border of Nepal and Tibet.

It was named after Sir George Everest, a British surveyor-general of India.

Age: approximately 60 million years old.

It is also called 'Chomolungma' by Tibetans and Sherpas, which means 'Mother Goddess of the Earth.'

From the peak it is possible to see Tibet, India, and Nepal.

Sir Edmund Hillary and sherpa Tenzing Norgay were the first to reach the summit on May 29, 1953.

There are two main routes to the top, one from Nepal and the other from Tibet.

The southern route from Nepal is the most popular, and the simplest to do.

There are also 16 other recognised routes.
