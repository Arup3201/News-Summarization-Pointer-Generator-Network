Five British MI-5 officers testified in a Brooklyn court in wigs and makeup at the trial of accused al Qaeda operative Abid Naseer on Tuesday.

A federal judge had approved the unusual attire in order to protect the agents’ identities and had also ruled that courtroom sketches of the officers must be portrayed with only 'blank faces' and 'generic hair'.

The U.S. government has accused Naseer of taking part in a plot to carry out bombing attacks in the United States and Europe.

A female agent – referred to Agent 1488 - gave evidence wearing a 50s style bob, heavy eye makeup and red lipstick.

The agent, in her 20s, also wore glasses, black heeled boots and a revealing low-cut top as she described how she followed Naseer around Manchester and Liverpool in England in 2009.

She also appeared to be adjusting her accent to further disguise her identity and mostly spoke in cut glass English - which occasionally sounded more working class.

The other agents who gave evidence were all male and described how MI5 gave code names to Naseer's associates including 'Glass Pendant', 'Undercurrent' and 'Happy Skater'.

The first agent was called 1661 and was an Asian man in his 20s who wore black wig with a side parting that was tucked behind his ears.

He also wore glasses, a dark suit and had grown a beard.

Under questioning by the prosecution, he spoke with a Northern accent and introduced himself as working for the 'British security services' as a surveillance officer.

One of the other agents was also an Asian man in his 20s who was identified as agent 1498, who wore a ruffled black wig, glasses and a dark suit.

Rather than appearing behind screens, the judge had decided to was better for the officers to wear disguises so that jury members could see their facial expressions and body language, and thus assess their credibility.

U.S. District Judge Raymond Dearie had also ordered media sketch artists at the trial of Pakistani-born Naseer to refrain from detailed portrayals of the officers with Britain's domestic counterintelligence agency, calling them 'committed, lifelong operatives.'

'The situation is grave,' Dearie said in a court hearing. He had earlier told prosecutors not to go overboard with the disguises because ‘I don’t want situation comedy in the courtroom’.

Prosecutors have called their testimony essential, saying their surveillance of Naseer from 2009 made them the only witnesses to activities he undertook to prepare for an attack in Manchester, England, which ultimately was never carried out.

Dearie had previously at prosecutors' urging approved a variety of steps aimed at protecting the officers' identities, including identifying them only through numbers and the use of wigs and 'light' make-up.

Dearie's order that artists draw Naseer with 'blank faces, generic hair,' came despite objections from some members of the media who called the wigs protection enough.

But Zainab Ahmad, a prosecutor, said not all of the officers would be wearing wigs.

Naseer, 28, faces up to life in prison if convicted of providing and conspiring to provide material support to al Qaeda and conspiring to use a destructive device.

Prosecutors say Naseer was leader of an al Qaeda cell plotting an attack on Manchester.

Another cell conspired to bomb the New York City subway system, while a third planned to attack a Copenhagen newspaper.

Naseer was initially arrested in Britain in 2009 along with a dozen men on suspicion of plotting the Manchester attack.

No charges were brought, and a British court blocked Naseer's deportation. Naseer was re-arrested by British authorities in 2010 after the United States indicted him, leading to his extradition in 2013.

Naseer, who faces life in prison if convicted, is representing himself.

He has pleaded not guilty and has said he went online and used email to find a wife, not contact an al-Qaeda handler.
