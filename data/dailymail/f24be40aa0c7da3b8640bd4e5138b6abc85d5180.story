Standing in line for a chance to see her within minutes of the zoo opening yesterday, the visitors’ mood was pregnant with excitement.

That much, at least, can be said with certainty, despite it still being unconfirmed if Tian Tian, the furry focus of thousands’ fascination every day, is expecting a cub.

But such is the air of expectancy over the mere possibility, that pre-booked viewing slots to see her and her male partner Yang Guang are now sold out for days in advance.

Only a limited number of tickets are being released each morning on a first come, first served basis as fans flock to Edinburgh Zoo for a peek before the UK’s only female giant panda pops (if, indeed, she ever does).

From toddlers in pushchairs to octogenarians with walking sticks, those lucky enough to have places on yesterday’s coveted viewing slots patiently waited to enter the panda enclosure in groups of 50 at a time.

A notice board outside warned ‘all panda viewing time slots are fully booked’, but, after paying the zoo’s £16 entrance fee, I was lucky enough to nab one of the last places, which cost nothing extra, on the 9.30am visit.

First you are led into a viewing area where you can see into the ten-year-old(ok) pandas’ indoor enclosure through floor-to-ceiling windows.

The blinds were down on Tian Tian’s, part of the process hopeful keepers are using to help mimic the atmosphere of a den that she would seek in the wild to have a cub in. Yang Guang briefly stuck his head round the entrance to his, but that was all we saw of him. No pacing up and down like an expectant father - but then, panda dads do leave raising the kids to mum.

In the outdoor viewing area, we were graced with Tian Tian’s presence. She bounded up her climbing frame and lay down on top of it for a few minutes. A chorus of ‘oohs’ and ‘aahs’ greeted her arrival as cameras clicked away.

Exiting via the zoo shop, you are surrounded by ‘panda-phernalia’ of every sort: t-shirts, tea towels, pens, fridge magnets, masks - you name it, they’ve got it and it’s all emblazoned with a panda. Cuddly pands toys alone are selling at a rate of 5,000 a week. Yesterday children were going homes with armfuls of the stuff.

There is a chance Tian Tian, seen roaming her Edinburgh Zoo enclosure today, could reject the foetuses or that her body could reabsorb them

After Yang Guang and Tian Tian failed to mate naturally, experts artificially inseminated the female giant panda with Yang Guang's semen so the cub or cubs will still be his

Craig Sommerville, 33, a customer relations manager for an energy firm, visiting with his niece Sophia, two, from Glasgow, said: ‘It’s not Edinburgh Zoo - it’s panda zoo.

It’s all about the panda here - everything is panda, panda, panda.’ Stephen Haarer, 48, a business analyst from Staines, London, who was visiting with his wife Judith, 47, and daughters Natalie, 15 and 13-year-old Samantha, booked their panda slot in advance via the zoo’s website to avoid disappointment.

‘We saw Tian Tian, I was quite surprised as I thought she’d be sleeping,’ he said. ‘A cub would be brilliant, it’d generate even more interest in conservation.’ Audrey Collins, 80, of Edinburgh, who has been visiting for 50 years, said: ‘It’ll be very interesting if they have a cub - and good for Edinburgh and good for the zoo.’

The zoo revealed on Monday that hormone tests suggest Tian Tian is expecting and could give birth to what would be the first panda cub to be born in the UK any day now.

But such are the peculiarities of panda biology, no one can be 100 per cent sure until she actually goes into labour.

It wouldn’t be her first cub. She had twins in 2009 at the zoo in China which loaned her and Yang Gunag (he was not the father on that occasion, but this time he may turn out to be) to Britain.

Unlike humans, pandas are as likely to have twins as they a single cub, but as they are only able to rear one cub at a time, when born in captivity the second cub is cared for by keepers.

By all accounts, she was a good mum too, picking up her newborns, cradling them in her arms and affectionately licking them.

Will such heart-warming scenes be witnessed in Edinburgh?

Keepers say she could give birth at any time in the next two weeks. In the meantime, all any of us can do is grin and, er, bear it as we await the hoped-for happy day.
