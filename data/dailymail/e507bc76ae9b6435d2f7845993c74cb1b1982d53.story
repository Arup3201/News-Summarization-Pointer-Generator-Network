Manchester United will give supporters a glimpse of Louis van Gaal in action when they broadcast Holland's friendly against Ecuador live on their in-house channel this Saturday.

The Dutch coach is expected to be unveiled as David Moyes' successor next week after the club revealed they would not announce anything immediately.

MUTV are handing fans the opportunity to see exactly how Van Gaal is setting up his side ahead of the World Cup - even if they are billing the screening as Robin van Persie coming up against team-mate Antonio Valencia.

Watching brief: Manchester United are screening Louis van Gaal's Holland against Ecuador on Saturday

The man to watch: Striker Robin van Persie will play for the Dutch as they prepare for this summer's World Cup

It will be shown at 7.30pm live from the Amsterdam ArenA.

Van Persie is Holland's captain and talisman up front, while Valencia provides a potent threat down the right for the South Americans.

There is some speculation as to how Van Gaal will operate in Brazil, which could have an impact on how United go about trying to regain their Champions League status next season.

His default formation is the popular 4-3-3, but the former Barcelona boss admitted this week that he had spoken to van Persie about a potential switch to 3-5-2.

'I discussed changing the formation with Robin as I talk about these matters with my captain,' he said, while there is talk that the 30-year-old could be handed the armband at Old Trafford this summer as well.
