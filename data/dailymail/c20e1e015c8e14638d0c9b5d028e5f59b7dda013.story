Today Show host Karl Stefanovic has risked a backlash after trying out his best sledge against a group of cricket fans ahead of India's World Cup semi-final against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

Stefanovic asked the team of India supporters: 'Who’s going to be manning 7-Elevens today?'

'I'm not sure about who's going to be manning 7-Elevens but you might have to look at Centrelink as well I think, Karl,' one of the fans hilariously retorted, owning the presenter with their response.

Karl Stefanovic asked a team of India supporters: 'Who’s going to be manning 7-Elevens today?'

The comeback caused an uproar of laughter in the Today Show studio, as Stefanovic said: 'What are you going to say to Warner?'

Australian cricketer Dave Warner was famously fined 50 per cent of his match fee after he told Indian batsman Rohit Sharma to 'speak English' at the MCG in January.

'Look I'm not sure we can repeat that stuff on TV this early in the morning,' the India fan smiled.

'We'll definitely be right into him that's for sure. We'll definitely be speaking in English so he understands,' the India fan said.

Viewers quickly reacted to Stefanovic's 7-Eleven question on social media, with some labelling it 'tasteless'.

One of the India fans (right) fired back telling Stefanovic he should be concerned as Centrelink will be empty of Australians as they all watch the cricket

Andy Cussen asked: 'How does Karl Stefanovic still have a job? Complete muppet.'

Megan Maurice said: 'You know, you just start to think that maybe Karl Stefanovic isn't that bad after all and then...'

Angus Roberts described his comments as 'bit of a tasteless "joke"'.

And Paul Nolan said: 'I'm usually a fan of Karl Stefanovic but his 7-11 quip today was inappropriate and offensive.'

Amber Monahan called Stefanovic 'an embarrassment to thinking Australians'

Doovalacky Dave called Stefanovic's comments 'gold'

Amber Monahan went as far as to call him 'an embarrassment to thinking Australians'.

'How dare you insult contributing members of Australia's economy. You sir are a fool. And Lisa Wilkinson guffawing in the background is hardly much better,' she said.

However, Doovalacky Dave called Stefanovic's comments 'gold'.
