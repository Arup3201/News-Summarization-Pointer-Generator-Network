Next stop, Match of the Day? Arsenal duo Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny have taken to the microphone to give their thoughts on the Gunners 3-0 win over Newcastle in April.

In the newest episode of a series of videos posted by Arsenal's YouTube account titled 'UnClassic Commentary', the defensive pair described their team's performance from the back end of last season.

Arsene Wenger's side ran out comfortable 3-0 winners at the Emirates, with Koscielny, Mesut Ozil and Olivier Giroud scoring the goals.

Mertesacker and Koscielny described the match action, giving a personal twist on the events of the game.

'Arsenal is on fire. Very tight, very tight at the back,' Mertesacker claims midway through the video, heaping praise on his own performance. 

The six-foot-six centre-back continues with his commentary, claiming there should have been a red card when Bacary Sagna collides with an opposition player.

Giroud scored Arsenal's third goal, but the striker was criticised earlier on for not passing

'Sagna, long ball. Come on ref?! Come on! Lets get serious. Red card, no?' Perhaps unsurprisingly, the referee didn't brandish a card for the offending incident.

The match action continues with Ozil's goal, shortly before half-time. The pair were critical of team-mate Giroud's selfishness in the build-up. 

'I think Olivier can give the ball, the first time to Mesut,' Koscielny said, before Mertesacker added: 'Are you in the tunnel Giroud? Come on!'
