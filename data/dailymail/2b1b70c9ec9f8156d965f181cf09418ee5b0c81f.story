A man drank two pints in the pub before going home, throttling his wife's pet cat and throwing its body in the dustbin, a court heard.

Mark Booth, 53, from Ripley, Derbyshire, told his wife that her female tabby called Oli was 'a nuisance' before going outside and strangling it.

His wife heard the lid of the wheelie bin slam shut before he walked back into the house, covered in scratches, and told her: 'The cat won't bother you any more', Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court was told.

Mark Booth, 53, from Ripley, Derbyshire, drank two pints in the pub before strangling his wife's cat, Oli

Booth, who is no longer with his wife, smirked outside the court where he admitted strangling his wife's cat yesterday.

John Sutcliffe, prosecuting on behalf of the RSPCA, said Booth came home from the pub at 7pm on 19 August last year and started complaining to his wife about the cat, which they had owned for about four years.

He said: 'Mr Booth said to his wife the cat had worms, which she was surprised by, and said the next day she would take it for treatment.'

Mr Sutcliffe said Mr Booth then went outside, and Mrs Booth heard the sound of the bin lid shutting two minutes later.

He said: 'He walked back into the house and she described him as being covered in his own blood from scratches to his arm.

'He said to his wife: "The cat wonâ€™t bother you any more.  I killed it, I strangled it.  You know it had to go.'

Southern Derbyshire Magistrates' Court heard that Booth later conceded he shouldn't have done it

He added: 'The couple are no longer together any more and it is not known if that is because of a consequence of this or whether it was a contributing factor.

'The couple had owned the cat for about four years, it was extremely affectionate, a female tabby called Oli.

'After the incident she [Mrs Booth] was very upset. She immediately left the house, and went to a friendâ€™s where they discussed what happened and what they should do.

'She then decided to call the RSPCA.'

Mr Sutcliffe said the cat was removed from the bin and taken to a vet who carried out a post-mortem examination on Oli.

He told the court: 'What there was, was evidence that the cat had been twisted by its neck.

'When Booth was interviewed about the incident he first said it was his wife that had got rid of the cat.

'But he later conceded he did it himself and that he should not have killed it in this way. He said he had been drinking but that he had only drunk two pints and was not drunk.'

Booth pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to an animal and magistrates adjourned the case for sentencing next week.
