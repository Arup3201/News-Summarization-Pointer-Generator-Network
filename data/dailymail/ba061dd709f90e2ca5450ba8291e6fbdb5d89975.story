A man who claims to be a cousin of Angelina Jolie has attempted to get a temporary restraining order against John Travolta, Brad Pitt and the Church of Scientology.

In a bizarre case, a man calling himself Jonathan Jolie claimed he was beaten by the two actors after he was sent to Florida 'by the Pope' to stop Pitt from becoming a Scientologist.

Unsurprisingly, the application for the temporary restraining order - which was lodged earlier this month - has not been granted and the case was dismissed this week.

However, details of the applicant's strange allegations have been made public for the first time.

Federal court documents make outlandish claims about the applicant receiving orders from the Pope to stop Pitt from joining the Church of Scientology to prevent the 'Jolie bloodline' from being 'ruined', Radar Online reports.

He also alleged Pitt and Travolta were having a clandestine affair.

Jonathan Jolie claimed he was at the Church of Scientology in Clearwater, Florida, on January 6 when he was physically assaulted by Pitt and Travolta.

According to Radar Online, Mr Jolie - who claims to live in the Vatican City - said: 'I take it personal because if Brad Pitt becomes a Scientologist, he will brainwash his Scientology beliefs on my cousin Angelina Jolie which means the Jolie seeds will be infected and our bloodline ruined.

'I am also albino by birth and marksman at night and Pope Benedict called me into his secret chamber and told me Brad Pitt must be stopped immediately.'

His documented statement added: 'Brad begged me not to tell Angelina because this conversion she did not know, it was to be kept a hidden secret, and Angelina Jolie also was not aware of Brad Pitt and John Travolta's affair with each other.'

He also claimed Pitt used a knife to cut
his face 'like Scarface' and that Travolta twisted him 'into a pretzel'
before the pair 'hog tied' him and dumped him in the Gulf of Mexico.
