Paul Hartley has emerged as a shock contender to replace Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as manager of Cardiff City.

The 37-year-old former Scotland international midfielder has been a success as manager at Dundee but only took over in January. 

He led them to the Scottish Championship title and promotion to the Scottish Premiership and has lost just three games while in charge.

Hartley, who had a spell with Bristol City as a player, was previously manager of Alloa Athletic.

His appointment at Cardiff would be a huge surprise but he has been identified as a young manager with great potential.

Cardiff, who were discussing a mutual agreement package with Solskjaer last night, have considered Tony Pulis but it is understood he would prefer to wait for another Premier League job.

Solskjaer’s departure is expected to be announced on Thursday morning.
