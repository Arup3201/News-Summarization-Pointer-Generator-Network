Thousands of nostalgic motorists were taken back to the swinging 60s this weekend at the world's largest scooter festival on the Isle of Wight.

The annual event invites scooter enthusiasts from all over the world to ride in a mass tour of the Isle, with many riders donning their finest mod gear for the occasion.

Ride Out scooter festival has been taking place every August since 1980 in Ryde, Isle of Wight.

Easy riders: Thousands of scooter enthusiasts flocked to the Isle of Wight this weekend to take part in Ride Out, the world's largest scooter festival

The festival has been running every August since 1980 and centres around the town of Ryde on the Isle of Wight

The event, which is run by the British Scooter Rally Assocation and The VFM Scooter Collective spans four days, during which time motorists spread out and set up camp across the Isle.

For many the party begins on the journey to Ryde, with organised convoys filling up the ferries with their stylish scooters and choppers.

Saturday afternoon saw the International Scooter Custom show with vehicle parts, clothing and accessories on offer to the thousands of revellers. A competition is also held and awards the best looking vintage scooter on the Isle a trophy.

The festival has been running since 1980, giving visitors a chance to revisit the swinging 60s when scooters were at their most popular.

At that time the moped was considered a fashion statement in Britain, and was most popular among the mod scene who decorated their bikes to attract more attention.

The Vespa, an Italian favourite, is still popular today among trendy city-livers who zip in and out of traffic on their colourful rides.

But Lambretta seemed to be the scooter of choice at the Isle of Wight, with thousands of motorists zooming around on Sunday on the bikes which also come from Italy.

Saturday night gave occasion to party with Ryde Ice Stadium playing host to bands and DJs, with visitors dancing until four in the morning to the sounds of the 60s.  A scooter dealer's market runs all weekend giving excited visitors the chance to buy their own vintage ride.

With top custom scooters costing up to £15,000 , the chance for a bargain is welcomed by enthusiasts.

Though the thought of thousands of 'bikers' might put some people off, the Isle of Wight is only too happy to welcome the scooter riders every year, with the Isle's tourist guide website describing them as 'friendly and colourful'. The event does wonders for the small community's pubs and restaurants and provides an exciting show for a few days every summer.

Until next time: Motorists hang up their helmets today but will be back next year
