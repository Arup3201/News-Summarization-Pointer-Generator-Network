Former Manchester United striker Michael Owen believes the club's failure to sign players early in the summer could cost them money as the transfer window draws to a close.

United have only signed two players since the end of last season - Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw - and lost their opening game of the season to Swansea.

Owen believes Louis van Gaal must add at least three or four new faces to his squad, even though players tend to cost more late in the window.

New boy: Ander Herrera is one of just two summer signings made by manager Louis van Gaal

He told Hawksbee and Jacobs on talkSPORT: 'The way to go in these situations is to do your business at the start of the window because it's probably a little bit cheaper. 

'People know they're going to be desperate now and there might be an extra zero going onto a price. It's difficult for Manchester United because they didn't have a manager at the start of the transfer window. But it's not too clever of them.

'Everyone can see they need to reinvest, but not just reinvest in players, they need frontline players. They need players that are going to go straight into that team because they don't need a huge squad.

'They've got numbers already and they're not in European competition. So they need three or four players that are going to go straight into that starting XI.'
