Jo-Wilfried Tsonga might have to wait a little longer for a day off. Having won his first-round match across five sets and two days, he repeated the trick on Thursday to survive an upset against Sam Querrey.

The 14th seed resumed his second-round tie at two sets apiece and 9-9 with Querrey serving, but the Frenchman battled through to win 4-6, 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 14-12.

It lasted a total of three hours and 39 minutes and meant he has now played on all four days of the Championships.

In a match dominated by high quality serving, Tsonga broke serve twice and Querrey once in the space of five sets, with neither player conceding even a single break point in the second or third sets.

Tsonga will next face Jimmy Wong of Taiwan in the third round ahead of a possible fourth-round match against Novak Djokovic.
