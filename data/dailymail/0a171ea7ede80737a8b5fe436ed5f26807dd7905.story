Urgent new rules were introduced last night to protect journalists and whistleblowers from police snooping.

MPs agreed to rush safeguards through Parliament before the general election to curtail the use of the hugely controversial Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act.

Police will now need the approval of a judge, via an order, before they can access phone records to try to identify a reporter’s sources.

Controversial: Police have  obtained the phone records of dozens of journalists, which led to the sacking of three police officers who lawfully leaked information about Andrew Mitchell's (pictured) 'Plebgate' scandal

Newspapers, including the Daily Mail, demanded changes to the rules when it emerged that police had secretly launched spying missions to get the phone records of two journalists investigating wrongdoing by MPs.

It has since emerged that police forces have viewed the phone records of 82 journalists over the past three years via RIPA, which is supposedly an anti-terror law.

The system operates in secret and there is no provision for journalists to challenge it.

The concern was that, if newspapers’ sources are not protected, whistleblowers will be deterred from contacting the Press – and scandals will remain secret.

The new rules are a temporary measure because there was no time to change the primary RIPA legislation before the current Parliament ends on March 30.

If police wish to view journalists’ phone records they will have to give notice to the parties involved and, if necessary, make the case for disclosure in court.

The Home Office said there is a commitment to introduce a law after the election to reform RIPA. The Liberal Democrats claimed the Tory side of the Coalition had been slow to act.

Metropolitan Police detectives used the call records of The Sun’s political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, to find and sack three officers found to have lawfully leaked information about the Plebgate incident.

Kent Police investigating the Chris Huhne speeding points scandal used RIPA to obtain the phone records of a journalist on The Mail on Sunday and one of his sources, even though a judge had ruled the source should remain confidential.

In the controversy that followed, the Society of Editors and Press Gazette launched the Save Our Sources campaign, which was backed by more than 100 editors.
