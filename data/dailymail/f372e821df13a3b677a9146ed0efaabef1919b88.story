A director of an online gambling firm linked to Harry Redknapp and two Premier League football clubs has been arrested over a £21m fraud probe, it has emerged.

Paul Bell, a director of 666Bet, was reportedly arrested at Heathrow airport last week as part of a joint money-laundering investigation by HM Revenue & Customs and the National Crime Agency.

Six other people were arrested, 13 properties were raided and £1m in cash was also seized as part of the investigation.

A director of an online gambling firm, which signed Harry Redknapp to star in its adverts (pictured above) has been arrested over a £21m fraud 

The online firm announced deals with West Bromwich Albion and Leicester City last summer. It also signed former QPR manager Redknapp to appear in its adverts, alongside Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels actor Vas Blackwood.

Last week, the UK gambling regulator The Gambling Commission suspended the firm's licence.

The suspension led to Football League One side Leyton Orient, which signed a contract with the bookmakers in August last year, terminating its deal for shirt sponsorship. It is not yet known whether the two Premier League clubs will follow suit. 

Speaking from Dubai, Mr Redknapp told the Independent on Sunday: 'I just did an advert for them. I don't know anything about it at all. Not a clue.' 

Mr Bell, a stockbroker who is now an investor, was reportedly arrested at Heathrow before being re-arrested the following day when he arrived on the Isle of Man by private jet.

According to a source, the businessman, who is said to be an active part of the community in the Isle of Man, has 'vigorously denied any wrongdoing'.

A spokesman for the firm added that the probe has 'nothing to do with the day-to-day running of 666Bet.' 

In an email to the Independent on Sunday, Neil Andrews, 666Bet's head of brand, said: 'I can categorically state the investigation does not relate to 666Bet's activities in the gamin (sic) world.'  

The firm's website is currently offline. Its official Twitter account said the site is under maintenance 'due to unforeseen circumstances'.

In another tweet, it says: 'We hope to have the site and our licence back ASAP but cannot comment on when this will be.' 

Although the Gambling Commission refused to comment, it previously said the suspension of the Metro Play Limited licence - which covers 666Bet and Metro Play - does not prevent the firm from 'returning outstanding balances to customers'.  

There is no suggestion that Metro Play Ltd, 666Bet or Metro are involved in the joint probe. 

Mr Bell, who is reportedly worth £400m, is a shareholder in several FTSE-listed companies and has been listed as the director and company secretary in dozens of companies.
