Eugenie Bouchard reached her second successive grand slam quarter-final by knocking out eighth seed Angelique Kerber at Roland Garros.

The 20-year-old made her grand slam breakthrough in January with a run to the semi-finals at the Australian Open and her progress in Paris has been just as impressive.

Bouchard came into the tournament in form after winning her first WTA Tour title in Nuremberg and her 6-1, 6-2 thrashing of Kerber was her ninth victory in a row.

New and improved: Bouchard believes she had developed her skills since the beginning of the year

German Kerber, who was a quarter-finalist in Paris in 2012, is the fifth of the top eight seeds to exit the tournament.

Bouchard was unfazed by her run in Melbourne and it is a similar story here.

The
 Canadian said: 'I feel like since the beginning of the year I have been
 improving my game, since Australia I'm at a different level from there.

'I'm
 confident and I really believe in my skills. I believe I can play with 
the best girls out there. She (Kerber) is top 10, so I respect her. She 
can play some really good tennis.

'I
 was really mentally prepared for anything, for a battle. I think that 
mindset helped me, made me realise whatever happens I can deal with it 
on the court.

'I was just really going for my shots. That was my intention. It worked.'

Sorry exit: Kerber's defeat means she is the fifth of the top eight seeds to be knocked out in Paris

Elation: Spain's Carla Suarez Navarro celebrates after beating Ajla Tomljanovic in the fourth round

It
 will be Carla Suarez Navarro who Bouchard plays in the last eight after
 the Spaniard defeated 21-year-old Ajla Tomljanovic 6-3, 6-3.

The
 14th seed last reached the quarter-finals in Paris back in 2008 while 
she beat Bouchard in the third round of Wimbledon last year.
