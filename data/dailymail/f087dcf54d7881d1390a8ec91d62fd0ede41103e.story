Derby County's high-flying season in the Championship can be partly attributed to the club's attempts to cut out the usage of foul language, according to coach Paul Simpson.

Rams boss Steve McClaren has guided the Rams to third in the Championship table - behind league leaders Middlesbrough and Bournemouth.

And Simpson believes the squad's ability to stay calm this campaign has proved dividends to their good form.

'If you're ranting and raving and swearing, you haven't got control. We say you are losing it so you may as well come and sit in the dugout,' he told BBC Radio Derby.

‘It was a surprise to me when we all came in here. When we arrived I realised that Steve has turned over a new leaf and very rarely swears.

‘We have realised that when you swear at people, it doesn't get the reaction you want.

'We try not to swear if we possibly can, and we certainly don't use foul and abusive language in the technical area when we are talking to officials - which seems to be the common trend.’

The feel good factor for the iPro Stadium side continued at the weekend with a resounding 4-1 win at home to Bolton in the Championship on Saturday.

And Derby twice battled back from a goal down to draw 2-2 at Bournemouth in a top of the table clash on Tuesday night as both sides continue to chase Premier League promotion.
