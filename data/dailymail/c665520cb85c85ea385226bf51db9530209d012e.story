Just hours after German designer Philipp Plein stunned onlookers at Milan Fashion Week by including automatic rifles in his catwalk show, another label has carried out a similiar attention-grabbing stunt - this time with machetes.

The G-Star Raw presentation, which took place in Berlin yesterday, saw models with outfits specially moderated to carry large knives and machetes take to the runway.

G-Star, which is headquartered in 
Amsterdam, used Kill Bill actor Michael Madsen as one of the models, and the veteran Danish-American thespian carried 10 knives and two machetes 
down the catwalk, all of which were tucked into special pockets on his 
G-Star denim jacket.

G-Star, a Dutch label, specialises in streetwear and uses 'raw' or untreated denim to create hard-wearing jeans.

And while the machete-wielding models did sport some denim clothing, many others wore military-style camouflage.

The
brand, which is sold around the world, has worked with a number of 
famous faces in the past, including actress Liv Tyler and former 
Blink-182 band member Tom DeLonge.

Among the audience yesterday was Hollywood actor in front of an audience that included Hollywood actor, Stephen Dorff.

Given that this is not the first controversial use of weaponry in a fashion week show, critics have suggested this is the start of a worrying new trend.

As designers fight to get heard among the noise, they are coming up with increasingly more shocking ways to grab headlines.

But as a growing number of street violence incidents, military abuse and mass shootings continue to shock the world, come critics have suggested it is inappropriate for fashion brands to appropriate this violent imagery so literally and to glamourise it for financial gain.

Phillip Plein's show yesterday was shocking from start to finish, with military-inspired pieces worn by models brandishing automatic rifles, and in one instance, carrying what looked like a rocket propelled grenade.

Others sported paramilitary-style balaclavas, while others carried rubber gas masks and had faces streaked with camouflage paint.

The German designer's show also included models daubed with slogan tattoos offering messages such as 'ONLY KILL FOR LOVE' and 'LIFE'S A GAME AND IT'S NOT FAIR'.

Like his models, Plein also opted for a military look, appearing at the end of the show dressed in a khaki T-shirt and fatigues.

Knowingly controversial, Plein recently hit the headlines after unveiling his new advertising campaign featuring what seemed to be two male twins kissing each other.

The recent round of men's fashion collections is rapidly drawing to a close with just the French capital left to show off its style nous.

But while there have been triumphs (step forward Christopher Raeburn and Tom Ford), it's the deluge of sartorial disasters that have made headlines.

From MAN's ludicrous plank headwear to Katie Eary's ghastly florals, there has been lots to laugh about but very little to actually wear.

Four by twos made for unusual accessories at MAN - but could you get through airport security wearing these?

Ludicrous: How many men would be willing to walk down the high street in a knitted scuba hood or supersized mittens like the ones that showed up at Sibling?Â 

London Collections: Men had begun well with a star-studded reception at Downing Street followed by critically acclaimed early shows from the likes of Lou Dalton, Bally and Topman.

But British Fashion Council member and model David Gandy's plans to turn London into the 'menswear capital of the world' took a blow as designs swiftly descended from sublime to silly.

In the wake of MAN's bizarre plank hats and unfinished-looking tunics came Sibling's super-sized take on knitwear, which saw models appear on the catwalk in what looked like knitted woolly scuba hoods.

Snoods so large the men in them could barely walk followed, while poor models had to endure enormous mittens that enlarged their hands to a gigantic size.

Skirting the issue: J.W. Anderson looks determined to make the male skirt a strong look for 2013

Meanwhile, at the usually excellent JW Anderson, men's and womenswear appeared to have been mixed up, with the Northern Irish designer sending models down the catwalk in frilly grey boob tubes.

Frilled shorts and leather minidresses completed the gender-bending collection, all accessorised with ruffled leather knee-high boots.

Then there was Katie Eary. Not content with getting models to wear prosthetic fangs, the designer created a collection that combined print and PVC to disastrous effect.

Big splashy florals, lashings of pink, cropped trousers and even court shoes were mixed and matched to create a wardrobe straight out of most men's nightmares.

Not funny: Even cheerleader-in-chief, David Gandy, couldn't raise a smile for some of the ghastlier offerings

Nooooo! Meggings make a comeback on the Emporio Armani catwalk (left) as do the reliably hard to wear mustard trousers (right)

But if London didn't exactly cover itself in glory, other fashion capitals haven't been far behind.

At Emporio Armani, usually a bastion of refined good taste, 'meggings' or male leggings staged a comeback along with grim mustard yellow trousers, while Philipp Plein's automatic rifles and balaclavas plumbed new depths of bad taste.

And now even Berlin is getting in on the act, courtesy of G-Star Raw's gratuitous machete-wielding models.
