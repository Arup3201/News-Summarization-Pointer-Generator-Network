'Upset': Dr Al Sattar, whose family were killed in a house fire, said his Muslim faith had been tested by the deaths of his family

A father whose wife and three children were killed in an arson attack yesterday said it was ‘God’s plan’ for them all to die.

Brain surgeon Muhammad Taufiq Al Sattar said his devout  Muslim faith had ‘been tested’, but he was able to draw comfort from the belief that his family are now ‘in paradise’.

His wife Shehnila, 47, daughter Zainab, 19, and sons Bilal, 17, and  15-year-old Jamil were killed when arsonists torched their home in Leicester when Mr Sattar was working away in Dublin.

It is feared the family was mistakenly targeted in a revenge attack after the death of a man in the city centre the night before.

Leicestershire Police have charged an 18-year-old man with murder over the fire. Further arrests have also been made in connection with the blaze. Yesterday, Mr Sattar said he is upset that he has still not been able to bury his loved ones two weeks after the tragedy.

A second post-mortem examination on the bodies has been delayed until at least October 8.

Mr Sattar, 52, whose religion encourages burial within 24 hours of death, said: ‘I am not angry but I am upset because I feel the post-mortem has been delayed.

‘I am happy because I know my family are in paradise.’

He said the last two weeks had been ‘extremely difficult’ for him, but added his faith in Islam had given him ‘strength’.

‘It was God’s plan to take the life,’ he said.

‘As a neurosurgeon I know we deal with life and death every day – so it was in my mind, something which is beyond your control.’

The hospital consultant and his wife 
had moved to Ireland from Pakistan and were living with their  children 
in Dublin before the family decided to move to the East Midlands to give
their children an Islamic education.

Mr Sattar remained in Dublin but commuted home three weekends a month.

The
family planned to return to live in Dublin once the children finished 
at school, and Mr Sattar, who is currently staying with friends in 
Leicester, said the burials would take place in the Irish capital.

He works at the neurological unit of Dublin’s Beaumont Hospital and privately at two clinics in the city.

He
told Radio 4’s Today programme how he had briefly glimpsed his 
fire-ravaged Leicester home on his return – but had no plans to return 
there.

The family were found dead in upstairs bedrooms after the fire at Wood Hill in Leicester

He said: ‘It was
very painful and I will not go to the house again. I have not been 
inside and I don’t want to. It is just a house, not a home with a 
family.’ The doctor said when he was told his entire family had died, he
‘cried but did not collapse’.

He
added: ‘Life and death is something beyond your control. It was an 
extremely difficult time but my very strong faith has helped. We are all
going to die some time.’

He said he was ‘delighted’ that community relations had remained peaceful in Leicester since the fire.

Kemo Porter, 18, from Leicester, has been charged with murder in connection with the fire.

He
is due to appear at Leicester Crown Court on October 4. A  19-year-old 
man was also arrested in connection with the deaths on Thursday and 
remains in police custody.

A
further seven men were arrested on Wednesday after warrants were 
executed at several properties in the Leicester area. Six of those men 
remain in police custody.
