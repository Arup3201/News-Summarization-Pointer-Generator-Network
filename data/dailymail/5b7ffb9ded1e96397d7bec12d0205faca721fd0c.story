Sophie Burgess, 19, died just 48 hours after giving birth to twins having contracted septicaemia 

A teenage mother has died after giving birth to twins eight weeks before their due date without ever getting the chance to hold her newborn babies. 

Sophie Burgess gave birth to Evie and Oliver at Wolverhampton New Cross Hospital after suffering cramps.

The 19-year-old, who was unconscious when the babies were born, contracted septicaemia and was rushed into a critical care unit.  

She died 48 hours later having never met the babies.

Her family have since paid tribute to the teenager who 'could not wait' to become a mother. 

On March 11, Miss Burgess from Telford, Shropshire, rushed to Princes Royal Hospital with her partner Alex Carter, 23, after experiencing cramps. 

She was transferred to the hospital in Wolverhampton where she gave birth to Oliver naturally. 

Doctors were then forced to perform an emergency Caesarean section to safely deliver Evie, with Miss Burgess unconscious throughout the procedure. 

Miss Burgess was moved to the hospital's critical care unit but died 48 hours later.

Speaking of his younger sister, who worked as a care worker,  Miss Burgess's brother, Craig, said: 'It is so sad that my sister never got to hold her children but Alex has not left their side since.

'They are out of the incubators now and both seem to be doing well. They are amazing and Sophie would have been so proud of them.

'I honestly cannot begin to describe Sophie, she was full of life. She could not wait to become a mother and as a family we will make sure her babies never forget her. They are her legacy now.' 

Miss Burgess's mother, Mandy, said the family did not know what had caused the 19-year-old to contract septicaemia which is poisoning in the blood. 

'Sophie contracted septicaemia after giving birth to her twins, the reason behind this is still unknown but the hospital have been conducting their own investigations.

'We are now planning Sophie's funeral.'

She had been living at the family's Telford home with her partner throughout her pregnancy. 

The babies weighed just 3lbs each once delivered eight weeks early in Wolverhampton's New Cross Hospital

The babies' father, Alex Carter, has 'not left their side' since their mother's death last week. They remain in incubators  

'Sophie and her boyfriend, Alex, lived at home with me while she was pregnant and we will be helping him alongside his family to bring up the twins when they get out of hospital.'  

'He has been an exceptional dad to Oliverand Evie so far.' 

A friend of the family has set up an online donations page to contribute towards the twins' upbringing as doctors at Wolverhampton New Cross Hospital investigate what caused the young mother to take ill. 

Ria Norris, who grew up with Miss Burgess, said she would have been 'a fantastic mother'. 

'She was so prepared for it. With her being young people might think they wouldn't t have been but both she and Alex really were.' 

Friends and relatives said Miss Burgess 'could not wait to become a mother' 

After being told that she might struggle to conceive children when she was younger, the care worker was 'over the moon' to learn she was pregnant last year, she added. 

'She was absolutely elated. The whole family was,' said Mrs Norris, 32. 

'Sophie loved being pregnant, she absolutely thrived on it. I think having been told that it might be difficult she just totally embraced it.'  

'The twins are the first grandchildren in the family so it's very special.' 

Mr Carter was equally excited having been with Miss Burgess for years, she said. 

'Alex was over the moon. He hasn't left the babies' side since they were born either. 

'It's amazing when in a situation where he might have some emotions, he doesn't have any resentment towards anyone. 

'He is amazing.'   

New Cross Hospital has launched an investigation into what may have caused Miss Burgess to contract septicaemia. 

Jonathan Odum, medical director at the hospital, said staff had been 'deeply affected' by the young mother's death. 

'Sadly Sophie developed a severe illness following the birth of her twins from which she deteriorated very quickly,' he said. 

'Despite the best efforts of the medical and nursing staff looking after her, she passed away on a critical care unit a few hours later.

'The staff in the maternity department and the critical care unit have been deeply affected by Sophie's death and the trust would like to pass on it's sympathy and condolences to her family and friends.

'An investigation into the cause of her death is currently being carried out.'
