Scottish officials are pointing the finger at English tourists after heaps of rubbish were allowed to pile up near the busiest border crossing with Scotland.

Grease-stained takeaway containers, empty plastic bottles and assorted litter covered the ground at the base of an overflowing bin on the A1 just north of Berwick-upon-Tweed, the northernmost town in England.

Stunned motorists snapped photos as they drove past the unpleasant sight that formed just metres from a sign that proudly welcomes visitors to Scotland.

This place is not a dump: Locals say the mess on the A1 is giving people the wrong impression of Scotland

Residents were so upset with the foul-smelling mess they complained to local and national officials and demanded it be cleared at once.

Scottish Borders Council apologised to angry residents and blamed English tourists who are visiting Scotland for the Commonwealth Games and other big summer events.

The eyesore is one of the first things motorists encounter as they enter Scotland at a border crossing used by about 23 million vehicles a year.

Locals say the sight of the bin is an awful advertisement for Scotland as it gives visitors the wrong impression of their country.

Scotland is seeing a spike in visitors - and roadside rubbish - thanks to a series of high-profile summer events

Joyce McLean, who resides about eight miles north of the border in Reston, is vowing to forward her photos to First Minister Alex Salmond.

The 69-year-old retired office worker for Northumbria Police said: ‘The amount of litter is phenomenal. It's a real problem - but it's people in cars throwing it out. It's very, very difficult to catch them.

‘I have never seen a rural area so bad. It's really time it was highlighted.’

She said two of her dogs have been maimed by broken tins on two separate occasions.

She added: ‘It sends out the wrong message during the Commonwealth Games.’

Locals also complained about waste that piled up at the lay-by just north of the A1 at Ayton.

Eyemouth resident Karen Walker called it ‘absolutely disgusting’.

With so many high-profile events taking place, Scotland is seeing an influx of visitors at the border crossing on the A1 and that means more rubbish is being dumped by motorists.

Scottish Borders Council is promising to review its refuse collection service at the border.

Scottish Conservative Borders MSP John Lamont said he hopes the issue will be resolved immediately.

He said: ‘Nobody wants to see litter all over the place when they arrive into Scotland. It's the kind of image that gives Scotland a bad reputation.’
