A Labour-run council has been accused of ‘petty politics’ after launching a last-minute bid to block a private school’s pioneering plan to become an academy.

Kings School, which charges £10,000 a year, wants to merge with a nearby state primary when it changes its status at the end of this term.

But the historic move is in doubt after North Tyneside Council decided to seek a judicial review, nine months after it learned of the scheme. It claims a statutory consultation process was not conducted properly.

David Bilton, the chairman of the trust that would run the new school, yesterday branded the legal challenge a ‘cynical move designed to cause the maximum anxiety’.

He added: ‘To put petty politics ahead of peoples’ wishes and children’s future education is thoroughly reprehensible.

‘At a time when the local authority is seeking to justify cuts in services, it is surprising that they regard the inevitable expense of seeking a judicial review in these circumstances as a proper use of council tax.’

Tory councillors complained the move was ‘ideologically’ driven to deny ordinary people access to an elite school.

Group leader Judith Wallace said: ‘The Labour party is ideologically opposed to independent schools - although hypocritically, both locally and nationally, a number of Labour politicians do choose to send their own children to them’.

Other fee-paying schools have previously applied to become academies. Many have seen pupil numbers fall as a result of the recession.

But Kings School, in the seaside village of Tynemouth, is understood to be the first to include a local state primary in the process.

The mixed school for four to 19-year-olds, which was founded in 1860 and whose former pupils include Stan Laurel and England and Leicester Tigers rugby player Toby Flood, has lost around a third of its pupils in recent years.

Kings School takes pupils from four to 18 years old and its motto is Moribus Civilis - ‘behave properly’.

Senior figures at Woodards Schools, a registered charity which runs a group of Anglican schools including Kings, decided to apply to become an academy. This allows it to continue to be run independently while being backed by taxpayers’ money instead of fees.

The plans included merging with nearby Priory Primary School, which was rated outstanding in its last Ofsted inspection.

The new school, called Kings Priory Academy, would continue to run on both sites but would be operated by the Woodard Academies Trust. A total of 1,425 places would be available with maximum class sizes of 25.

Details were announced in September last year and the school is already heavily oversubscribed.

But the plans are in jeopardy after North Tyneside Council, which has had to make savings of £40 million over the past four years, claimed the consultation had not included ‘appropriate’ people with an interest.

Parents with children already in the schools were consulted and 90 per cent were in favour of the change.

But the council says parents with children at other schools in the area should have been asked for their opinions.

Elected Labour mayor Norma Redfearn said: ‘The council has a responsibility to ensure that all children and young people in North Tyneside can access the highest quality education.

‘The impact of the proposed Kings Priory Academy on the wider schools system in North Tyneside has not been properly considered.’ Mr Bilton insisted the legal threat would not derail the merger and said it would be up and running by the start of the autumn term.
