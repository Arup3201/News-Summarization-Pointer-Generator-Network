Here, from Louis van Gaal, came a demonstration of what a good international manager can achieve at a World Cup.

Never mind nine points from what was meant to be a difficult group. Never mind the 10 goals.

Van Gaal can take a midfielder from recently-relegated Norwich City and turn him into a match-winner — as he did with Leroy Fer only two minutes after sending him on from the bench.

And he can take a defence that was fairly shambolic against Australia, despite winning the game, and reorganise them well enough to withstand the considerable pressure imposed by this stylish Chile team.

True, the South Americans who have dazzled at this tournament did not play with quite their usual intensity in the knowledge that, like their opponents, they were already into the next round.

It was simply a case of trying to win the group in the hope that this would probably mean avoiding Brazil in the last 16.

Even so, Van Gaal responded to one bad defensive display in a way that Roy Hodgson did not — even though there were enough warning signs against Italy to demand action before his England side met Uruguay.

Van Gaal reminded us how tactically astute he is on this occasion, returning to a back five — complete with Dirk Kuyt at left back — who defended with a high line to reduce the space that Chile like to use.

Holland’s second goal — a second of the tournament for the impressive Memphis Depay — was the perfect example of counter-attacking football, the Dutch breaking from a Chile corner and cashing in on the brilliance of the super-quick Arjen Robben.

Van Gaal did not appreciate being asked why he had played so defensively in the post-match press conference. ‘Could you give a definition of attacking football?’ he replied. ‘That is my question to you. If you are going to ask me questions, I am going to ask you questions.

‘It was a match of the highest level and the cleverest team won. We were able to neutralise Chile.

‘If you look at my CV, you’ll see that I win a lot of matches. I believe that you have to create a strategy to win. If it had not worked you would have chopped off my head.’

With Robin van Persie suspended — and therefore no Van in the Dutch team for the first time since 1996 — Van Gaal was forced to make changes which included the curious selection of Kuyt in a defensive role.

It all worked beautifully. Not until the 23rd minute did Chile even threaten, Felipe Gutierrez meeting a corner from the inventive Alexis Sanchez with a first-time shot that flew over.

Holland were letting Chile have most of the ball. Almost 70 per cent. But Chile were still becoming frustrated and might have had cause for complaint 10 minutes before the end, when Stefan De Vrij’s elbow appeared to spare Nigel de Jong the ignominy of an own goal and what would have been an equaliser.

By then Robben had already emerged as the game’s outstanding player. One trademark, 60-yard run so nearly secured a first-half lead and the Munich forward was furious at dragging his shot wide.

With the changes the future  Manchester United manager made came yet more impressive results — Fer meeting Daryl Janmaat’s terrific, 77th-minute cross with a thumping header.

Depay then had the legs to keep up with Robben and arrive in Chile’s six-yard box at the right time to convert his perfectly-timed cross.

It means an extra day’s rest for Holland.
