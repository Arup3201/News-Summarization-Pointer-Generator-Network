Two conmen who swindled vulnerable elderly people out of thousands of pounds by posing as workmen have been jailed for 'bleeding' their victims of every penny they had.

Steven Wood, 30, and his brother-in-law Ryan Lowe, 21, were both jailed after they demanded money from Kathleen Gardner, 81, and Peter Rothwell, 86 for botched building work.

Jointly, they defrauded them of nearly £80,000, and the frail pair were both forced to go into care homes after they were duped.

Yesterday Teesside Crown Court heard that Wood is already serving a three and a half year sentence for exploiting three vulnerable pensioners.

It was only when widow Mrs Gardner stood up to her tormentors that her family and the police realised that she had been exploited by the pair who posed as workmen and carried out shoddy building 'repairs ' to her home.

Mrs Gardner was charged well in excess of £6,000 for a botched building repair which - even if it had been carried out competently - was valued at just £30.

Nephew Michael Hall said his aunt had a clock on her mantel piece which she treasured because it had been given to her by her late husband Aubrey.

When the men threatened to take the clock unless she wrote them another cheque she was so frightened that she called Mr Hall 200 miles away in St Albans.

Mr Hall, 64, an Assistant Investigator for Hertfordshire Police, called police - and what the judge called Lowe and Wood's 'conspiracy' to target the elderly finally began to unravel.

Richard Bennett, prosecuting for North Yorkshire Trading Standards, told the court: 'Wood has made a career out of targeting elderly and vulnerable victims.

Victim Kathleen Gardner paid £6,000 for a job that should have cost £30

'His activities have generated a large amount of money over a number of years.

'Lowe made it his business to identify house-holders who could be easily over charged for gardening or property work.

'In the current case, he was able to find two ideal victims.

'Both were elderly people, both lived alone, and both suffered from dementia.'

Mrs Gardner, of Thornton Dale, North Yorkshire, who suffered from memory loss, was conned out of nearly £6,000 before she told her nephew she was being threatened.

The same day she went into a home where she still resides. 'She was placed into care very rapidly and as a direct consequence of the fraud,' Mr Bennett added.

Both her bank and the village postmistress became suspicious and cheques were stopped - but by then the men had moved on to widower Mr Rothwell, of Haxby, near York, who they stole £72,000 from.

He was charged for 'building and gardening' work, but when his home was examined by an expert surveyor and an arboriculturalist, no evidence could be found of any work at all having been carried out.

Mr Bennett added: 'He would leave large piles of cash lying around his house. He was the perfect victim for Lowe and Wood.'

His daughter Jane Rothwell returned from Crete to find not only was no substantial work carried out on the property, but a number of valuables had been stolen. He has now had to go into a care home.

Defending counsel asked the Recorder of Middlesbrough Simon Bourne-Arton to consider both men's guilty pleas and that Lowe was of previous good character.

Wood, who was jailed last year for the West Yorkshire offences, was sentenced to four and a half years for six fraud and money laundering offences.

One of his previous victims, an 
82-year-old woman from Wetherby who Wood conned into driving to her bank
on her mobility scooter to withdraw £3,500 for gardening work.

He duped her into believing she would be fined £7,000 unless she had some conifers removed.

The judge told him: 'From 2008 to 2012 you have set about a determined targeting of vulnerable, infirm and elderly victims.'

'You did so out of one motive and one motive only - sheer greed.

'What you did was to bleed these victims of what little money they had left' 

'You did so without any thought or care for the consequences of your offending.

'You had no thought at all of the misery you would cause to those you targeted in the latter part of their lives.

'In all probability, it caused Mrs Gardner to go into care prematurely. You gave no thought whatsoever to any of that.

'What you did - both of you - was to bleed these victims of what little money they had left and in the case of the gentleman it was a very considerable amount of money.

'You have set out in quite a determined way to commit these offences and do not let the inconvenience of being arrested stop you in any way throughout your career as a criminal.'

Lowe, of Bickerton, Wetherby, admitted 13 fraud and money laundering offences.

Jailing Lowe for three years, the judge told him it would have four if it was not for his early guilty plea.

Outside court, Mr Hall said his aunt and other elderly victims had been robbed of their last few years of independent living.

'These people are from a generation which believes there is good in everyone. They don't realise there are bad people out there trying to take their money," he said.

'It was probably these despicable people taking the clock that made my aunt take a stand. They said unless they got a cheque they would take it.'

County council Head of Fraud Ruth Andrews said: 'Victims such as this have a right to live their last years in comfort and security and not to be targeted by abhorrent defendants such as these.'
