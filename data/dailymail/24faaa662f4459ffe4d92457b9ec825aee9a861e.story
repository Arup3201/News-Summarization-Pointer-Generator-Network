An Arizona baby who has born seven weeks premature has successfully undergone a heart transplant at just six days old - and is believed to be the youngest person in the nation to do so.

The parents of baby Oliver, Caylyn Otto and Chris Crawford, say they feared the worst, after their son was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy during a 20-week scan.

The Mesa couple were told there was a serious possibility Oliver would be stillborn, and if he did survive he would need a heart transplant to live.

Then the situation worsened during a 28-week checkup, with a scan showing Oliver's left ventricle was seven times the size of a healthy 28-week-old's left ventricle, AZ Central reported.

Survivor: Oliver, who was born at 33-weeks-old, was not expected to survive the delivery because of his pre-diagnosed heart condition, but went on to undergo and survive a heart transplant at six-days-old

Caylyn and Chris were told to prepare for the worst, and the two started preparing for their unborn baby's funeral.

However doctors at Phoenix Children's Hospital refused to give up.

They decided to deliver Oliver at 36 weeks, believing that would be his best chance at qualifying for a heart transplant.

However at 33 weeks Caylyn woke in the middle of the night screaming - her waters had broken.

She was rushed to to Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center in Phoenix, where she begged doctors to delay her delivery, knowing she had to wait as long as possible.

Doctors could only push the birth back a few days, and Oliver was born at 33-weeks-old.

Prayers: Mom Caylyn Otto did not expect her son to survive, and had even planned his funeral while she was pregnant 

Fighter: Doctors at Phoenix Children's Hospital have described Oliver as a miracle

Oliver was put under strict observation, as doctors assessed whether he was healthy enough for a heart transplant.

On Friday January 9 they put him on the national waiting list, and because of his size he automatically went to the top.

By Sunday afternoon a heart had become available, and Oliver was taken into surgery at midnight.

The operation lasted over 10 hours, but Oliver survived.

Having been over a month, doctors are pleased to report that Oliver's body has not rejected the heart he received.

The doctors are astonished.

'I do feel there was something miraculous that happened with this child,' Dr. Christopher Lindblade told AZ Central.

Family: Chris Crawford and Caylyn Otto are seen here with other son

Mom: Caylyn Otto feared the worst after their son was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy during a 20-week scan

However they do not know when he will be allowed home.

Caylyn said she wants to thank Oliver's doctors for what they did for him.

'They never gave up hope, and we're so grateful for that,' she said.

Officials at the hospital say that Oliver is the youngest person in the United States to have undergone a heart transplant.
