Edward Griffiths is right – the system of ending the Aviva Premiership with play-offs to decide the title is all about money. The motive is surely beyond doubt.

Saracens’ chief executive rattled cages at the start of the domestic season last weekend by arguing that a league should be settled in the traditional manner, with the club who finish on top of the table becoming champions. But it was his honesty in declaring that the status quo is ‘only there for money reasons’ that really resonated.

There is no imminent prospect of the landscape being altered, but that doesn’t diminish the validity of Griffiths’ remarks. Financial necessity drives the annual ritual of a 22-game campaign hinging on what follows; two semi-finals and a winner-takes-all final at Twickenham.

A league is decided in cup format, which means it’s not really a league. That is not to knock the spectacle, which is often breath-taking, but after all these years it still doesn’t seem quite right. No wonder, really, as 12 titles have been settled via the play-offs, but only four clubs in that time have claimed the trophy after claiming first place – Sale, Leicester (twice) and Harlequins.

There is never any real fanfare of support for the play-off system among participants. By and large, when asked about it, coaches and players unite in the view that it is now established and the same rules apply to everyone, so there can’t be any complaints.

It is accepted, but not cherished. Yet, it is the standard model in professional rugby; used to decide France’s Top 14, the Pro12, Super 15 and the Championship tussle for promotion to the Premiership – where it is such a distorting factor that much of the regular season becomes incidental.

The global calendar is too crowded, so removing play-offs would be wise in the bigger picture too. Perhaps a successful World Cup in these parts next year will generate such a surge in interest that a simple league format will suffice in generating precious profit.

If there is a common desire to end the English season in style each year, how about this? Instead of play-offs, followed by England facing the Barbarians, perhaps the Premiership champions can go to Twickenham the following week to take on the national team (minus that club’s contingent) in a non-cap game. Now that would be a club v country confrontation worth watching.

When World Cup tickets go on public sale on Friday, there will be a stampede to watch the big games involving hosts England, Wales and other leading nations, especially New Zealand. But much of the tournament’s charm will be found in lower-key pool fixtures, when neutrals choose sides to support or attend in the hope of an upset.

 In Brighton, Northampton’s American No 8 of Tongan descent, Samu Manoa, will be unleashed in brutal combat with the Pacific-island anagram of his name (Manu) Samoa. The earth will shake. Shock-seekers may fancy an afternoon at Kingsholm when Scotland face Japan, who are rising under the guidance of Eddie Jones and beat Wales last year. Gloucester’s ground also hosts Argentina v Georgia – heaven for scrum purists and a chance to observe the East European’s giant Mamuka ‘Godzilla’ Gorgodze at close quarters. Sandy Park, Exeter will reverberate as Tongan warriors attempt to find a way past Namibia’s immovable object – Jacques Burger of Saracens. 

Games like these will not be overly corporate occasions so take advantage of fair prices, adopt a minnow, paint faces and embrace the colour and diversity of the event.

The home nations are running for the hills – literally – when the World Cup countdown begins in earnest next summer. England go to Denver, Colorado for a fortnight and Wales are off to find height and heat; in Switzerland and Qatar. Never mind the fitness benefits of training at altitude, these are wise moves by Messrs Lancaster and Gatland for less scientific reasons. Cabin fever is a major threat. 

While the tournament doesn’t start until mid-September, squads will be together for the best part of 10 weeks prior to that point and no matter how luxurious the location, monotony becomes a big factor. Test rugby is such a detailed, labour-intensive business now, but the pursuit of excellence can go too far. On the basis that a change is as good as a break, different scenery will help to maintain focus. Down-time and the odd sociable outing are vital too, while briefly escaping the glare of pre-tournament hype is a sensible step. Minds as well as bodies must be fit for purpose.

There is much consternation in New Zealand rugby circles about the imminent loss of a teenage prodigy known as ‘Tongan Thor’. Taniela Tupou is a 21-stone prop who grew up in Tonga but is said to have supported Australia – which is where he is now heading, with reports Down Under that the 18-year-old is poised to sign for Queensland Reds. Tupou came to wider prominence in May when his power running and try-scoring exploits for Sacred Heart School in Auckland became a worldwide internet sensation. 

He was asked to sign a loyalty agreement with the New Zealand Rugby Union, but refused to do so and is now set to move across the Tasman Sea. The All Blacks have often benefited from an influx of Polynesian talent, but this is a monstrous prospect from the islands who is on course to torment them in years to come, on behalf of the Wallabies.

Last Word – There was no doubt in the minds of Northampton supporters at Franklin’s Gardens last Friday; Gloucester hooker Richard Hibbard dived to win a penalty. That was certainly the impression in real time and when the incident was replayed. The Welsh Lion collided with rival Dylan Hartley, there was a fleeting pause then he crumpled to the turf. Referee Wayne Barnes was fooled but such theatrics are a creeping trend in the game which must be snuffed out. 

After last season’s Heineken Cup Final, Springbok wing Bryan Habana chose to apologise for an exaggerated fall which Saracens captain Steve Borthwick denounced at the time as ‘embarrassing’. Habana duly noted that ‘sportsmanship and integrity’ are central pillars of rugby’s appeal, but they will soon collapse if mass, football-style deceit becomes the norm. Hibbard is a tough bloke, as amply demonstrated in the Lions’ demolition of Australia in Sydney last year. It is beneath him, Habana and others to act as con artists.
