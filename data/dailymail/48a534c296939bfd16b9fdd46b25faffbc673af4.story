A father has braved four storey-high waves and a force nine gale to row across the Atlantic Ocean in a bid to help find a cure for his son’s illness.

James Prior, 49, from Wandsworth, London, has raised more than £100,000 to pay for research into a cure for Crohn’s disease.

The father-of-four took on the gruelling trial because his son, Fergus, 10, has the crippling digestive condition.

James Prior, 49, has raised more than £100,000 for Crohn's and Colitis UK by rowing across the Atlantic Ocean. His son, Fergus, 10, has the crippling digestive condition, Crohn's disease

Mr Prior, and seven others, rowed from Gran Canaria to Barbados in 32 days. They travelled in an open-topped boat and braved a force nine gale. They are pictured after arriving in Barbados (Mr Prior is third from right)

Mr Prior, who had never rowed before, told MailOnline: ‘It was extremely brutal from start to finish – it’s a very hard routine of rowing for two hours on and two hours off during the day, and four hours on and four hours off during the night.

‘We were delighted when we finally saw land and it was fantastic to see our families again.’

He added: ‘Fergus deals with his condition incredibly well, despite getting frustrated, he takes his pain on and never complains.

‘He’s a fighter and I took on the Atlantic challenge to highlight the daily challenges faced by people with Crohn’s and colitis.

‘These can be tough conditions to live with, and while I was up against the Atlantic elements for one month, Fergus has a lifetime of Crohn’s challenges ahead of him. We want to help by tracking down the elusive cure.'

Mr Prior said: 'We were delighted when we finally saw land and it was fantastic to see our families again.' He is pictured greeting his wife, Fiona, when he arrived in Barbados

Mr Prior, and eight others, rowed 
unsupported from Gran Canaria to Barbados in 32 days and 22 hours before
 arriving in Barbados on March 15.

During the challenge they rowed through a force nine gale and experienced conditions Mr Prior described as ‘like a non-stop huge rollercoaster’.

They lived off dehydrated food and slept in the base of the open-topped rowing boat.

Mr Prior said: 'I was very respectful of what was to come. I knew it would be a huge challenge - and it certainly didn’t let us down. I was very grateful to my fellow rowers who all rowed very strongly.'

He added: ‘Fergus was absolutely thrilled when I got back. All of the boys have been amazing throughout. Fergus was very sweet about it.'

Fergus suffers severe stomach pains, he struggles to put on weight and has a poor appetite because of his Crohn's disease. About every six months he has to be tube-fed a highly nutritious liquid diet for eight weeks

Fergus was just five years old when he was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease.

This is a chronic condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system.

The
 inflammation can affect any part of the digestive system from the mouth
 to the back passage, but it most commonly occurs in the small intestine
 and the large intestine.

Symptoms include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fatigue and weight loss.

The exact cause is unknown but it is thought to be linked to genetics, an immune system problem, or a previous infection.

Fergus (pictured with his brothers, Archie, 11, Max, eight, and Henry, six) may eventually need strong drugs or surgery but he can't have the medication yet as it could weaken his immune system or prevent him growing

There is no cure so the aim of treatment is to stop the inflammation and to relieve symptoms.

In some cases, surgery is required to remove damaged parts of the intestines.

Fergus’ mother, Fiona Prior, first noticed his symptoms when he was about two and a half.

She says she was aware he was going to the toilet a lot and that he seemed tired and had a poor appetite.

She also noticed that he was very thin and that he would go and lie down during meals. He also suffered from chronic stomach pains.

Mr Prior said that at times the experience was like being on a 'non-stop huge rollercoaster'. The rowers are pictured letting of flares to celebrate arriving in Barbados

Mr Prior, and his fellow rowers, rowed for two hours and then had two hours off during the day and at night they rowed for four hours and then had four hours to sleep

She
 told MailOnline: ‘I kept persisting and taking him to the doctor 
because I could see that he was not as robust as my other sons.

Crohn’s disease is a long-term condition that causes inflammation of the lining of the digestive system.Inflammation
 can affect any part of the digestive system, from the mouth to the back
 passage, but most commonly occurs in the last section of the small 
intestine (ileum) or the large intestine (colon).Symptoms
 include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, fatigue and weight loss and, in the 
long term, the inflammation can result in additional complications, such
 as narrowing of the colon.It isn’t fully understood what causes the condition but genes, a faulty immune system and previous infection may play a role.There
 is no cure but there are medications to help control symptoms. In up to
 75 per cent of cases, surgery will be needed to repair damaged parts of
 the digestive system.

There are currently at least 115,000 people living with Crohn’s disease in the UK.Crohn's
 disease can affect people of all ages, including children. However, 
most cases first develop between the ages of 16 and 30.

‘I just kept being told it was his age, or that I should bring him back in a few months if his condition didn’t improve.’

Eventually, Fergus was given an endoscopy – an internal examination using a camera - but it didn’t show anything.

However, a second endoscopy revealed that he had Crohn’s disease.

Mrs Prior, who also has three other sons – Archie, 11, Max, eight, and Henry, six - said: ‘Ferg managed to keep everything together but would always have a sore stomach.

‘We were relieved when he was diagnosed – we were relieved to know he finally had a proper diagnosis but it was a big blow as well.’

Immediately after his diagnosis, Fergus was admitted to the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital because he had become very thin.

He was put on a special, highly nutritious, liquid diet that was fed to him through a tube which was inserted into his stomach via his nose.

Fergus, who was also born with just one kidney, was released from hospital after eight days but his parents had to continue to give him the nasal feed every two hours, six times a day for eight weeks.

This gave his body time to recover and allowed him to put on some weight.

He is too young to be given other medications yet as they could weaken his immune system and prevent him growing properly.

As a result, his treatment currently revolves around being given eight weeks of the special nasal feed every time his condition deteriorates.

So far, this has happened four times and on every occasion, Mrs Prior has to go to Fergus’ school every two hours to give him the feed.

She said: ‘I have to stop everything. My life completely goes on hold. We can’t really go anywhere but we just have to adapt.’

Each time he is put on the liquid diet, it allows his digestive system to recover sufficiently that he is able to cope with normal food for a few months before her starts to lose weight and develop severe symptoms again.

Fergus (pictured with his parents, James and Fiona) was diagnosed with Crohn's disease when he was five

At this point, he has to have another spell of being tube-fed.

Mrs Prior told MailOnline: ‘Ferg is amazing, he is such an inspiration. He never complains and it never gets him down. He has a great sense of humour. He charms all of the doctors and nurses.’

Mrs Prior says that she and her husband decided to try and make something positive out of the situation so they set themselves the challenge of raising £100,000 for Crohn’s and Colitis UK in a bid to help find a cure.

She says Mr Prior considered attempting to climb Mount Everest but decided against it as he has a fear of heights.

Fergus said: 'Before this, Dad had never rowed. He is amazing, very brave and we are all incredibly proud of him'

As a result, he settled on attempting to break the world record for the quickest row across the Atlantic.

Unfortunately, he missed the record by just a few hours as the ocean currents went against the rowers.

Before he left, Mrs Prior said: ‘There will be hour by hour pain for James – this is a correlation with the pain Fergus suffers every day.

‘We wanted to come up with something positive we could really get behind and James thought he could turn his mind to rowing.’

Mrs Prior added: ‘I am quite worried. We have been so busy fundraising we have hardly had a minute to stop and think.

‘It will be quite a thing not having him around for about six weeks but we just remember why we are doing it and that keeps us going.

‘I think it’s going to be gruelling and we are suitably respectful of what he is undertaking.

‘James is very focused so I am sure he can do it – I just hope it’s not too gruesome.’

She added: ‘Medical research into a cure is the most important thing. It’s a disease not many people think about so we want to raise awareness too.

‘It’s chronic so Ferg will have to suffer for the rest of his life with it unless a cure can be found.’

Mr Prior added: 'At my age I think I will have to take a forced retirement from rowing. I would certainly look at doing something else though. It was a great challenge and a wonderful thing to do, but I think it’s a younger man’s game.'
