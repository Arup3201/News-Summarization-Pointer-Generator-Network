It seems a Chinese property developing giant is in need of a geography lesson when it comes to its Australian market, at least if this location map is anything to go by.

The Greenland Group is currently selling luxury one, two and three bedroom apartments off the plan in North Sydney.

Part of the marketing material is a map that pinpoints the Lucent North Sydney project and its proximity to bars, shops, schools and iconic landmarks - but some locations are completely off the mark, Property Observer reports.

The North Sydney swimming pool is on the wrong side of the Harbour Bridge entirely. It is situated in the CBD's busy shopping district, according to Greenland's map.

The Sydney Opera House is nowhere to be seen on the map, with Martin Place standing where it should be.

To get a drink at the iconic Opera House's Opera Bar, you would have to go all the way over to the lower north shore.

The luxury apartments being sold in the Lucent development are priced from $528,000

The apartments are being marketed on its resort-style facilities like the rooftop infinity pool overlooking Sydney's glittering harbour

Balustrades of fitted glass or perforated metal and sliding metal screens on lower levels are in place on lower levels for privacy

Sydney's theme park Luna Park would normally be seen from the shoreline underneath the Harbour Bridge, but Greenland's map has it right back in North Sydney's CBD area.

Pitt Street Mall and the Queen Victoria Building (QVB) are two of the CBD's most central shopping areas, but the map has them situated on the other side of the Harbour Bridge in North Sydney.

The apartments being sold in the Lucent development are priced from $528,000.

The development has been designed by award-winning architectural firm Turner, according to its website

The map showing the development's close proximity to everything indicates it is near Pitt Street Mall and the QVB, even though they are actually located on the other side of the Harbour Bridge

The apartments ensure 'you're perfectly placed to make the most of Sydney's world-famous lifestyle', according to the website

'At Lucent, you're perfectly placed to make the most of Sydney's world-famous lifestyle,' the marketing website reads.

'Step out of your elegant living space and you'll find some of Sydney's finest cafes, bars, restaurants, shops, parklands and school.

'A short train, bus or ferry trip takes you to cultural icons such as the Sydney Opera House and Museum of Contemporary Art.'

The location map has since been corrected on Lucent's website.
