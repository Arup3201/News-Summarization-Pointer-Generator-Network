A 25 stone man has shed almost half his body weight after cutting out the carbs.

Anthony Fox, 46, ate up to 70 slices of bread a week - and piled on the pounds as a result.

Now the sandwich addict has finally beaten the habit and has shed a massive nine stone.

Fox, ate his way through 20 loaves per month, which is 11,200 calories in bread alone.

Carb addict: Anthony Fox used to eat up to 70 slices of bread a week - the equivalent of 20 loaves per month

Slimmer: Anthony's love affair with bread left him tipping the scales at 25 stone before he gave it up

Bread ban: Anthony can now fit into most of his wardrobe but couldn't when he was a carb addict

Instead of tucking into his favourite peanut butter and marmite sandwiches, Fox now plumps for healthier fare such as weetabix and jacket potatoes and has also cut out sweets and other fattening treats.

'I started putting the weight on when I got my first job in London in 1987,' revealed Fox. 'I moved from Derby to London and 
there was food everywhere - KFC, Pizza Hut, McDonald's.

'Socialising 
always revolved around drinking and eating. I've been on a few diets and have lost up to six stone, but for one reason or another I've always put it back on.

'I loved bread, I'd always eat at least 10 slices a day - sometimes all in one sitting.'

Despite his unhealthy diet, Fox only realised matters had gotten out of hand when he discovered he'd grown too big for everything in his wardrobe but his work uniform and a pair of elasticated jogging bottoms.

The Derby Homes employee said: 'I used to love peanut butter and marmite sandwiches - I'd be eating 10 slices for my breakfast alone at the weekend.

'But when I got invited to a work 
Christmas party, I realised the only clothes that fitted me were my work
uniform, three tops and my jogging bottoms.

'I was fat, sweaty and unhealthy. I thought enough was enough. Now I'm much more confident and happier with myself.'

Fattening: They might not look much but together, 70 slices of white bread add up to a whopping 2,800 calories

Moderation: Although he hasn't given up bread entirely, he's swapped sandwiches for brown toast and marmite

Prodded into action by the sartorial shock, Fox joined his local Slimming World group and, 18 months later, weighs just 16 stone.

Instead of feasting on carbs, he now enjoys healthy home-cooked meals and has swapped his lunchtime sandwiches for salad.

Along with looking better, the new diet has left Fox feeling better too. He used to suffer from high blood pressure and painful joints, but now his blood pressure has fallen and he no longer suffers from a bad back or joint pain.

He said: 'Before I would get the bus everywhere, now I can walk to work and I even bought a bike for the first time in 30 years.'

Despite the healthy new lifestyle, Fox, who now has plenty of clothes that fits and three Christmas parties already lined up this year, hasn't entirely quit the carbohydrates.

'I love carbs and this way I can still eat them,' he admits, before adding: 'But I don't eat sandwiches any more.

'If I want bread I have brown with Marmite, and if I get a craving for peanut butter I have a healthy peanut bar instead.'

Binned: Now he's ditched the carb habit, Anthony says he's happier - and healthier - than ever
