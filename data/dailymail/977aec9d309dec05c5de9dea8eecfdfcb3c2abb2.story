A vigilante mother found guilty of assaulting two schoolgirls after she suspected one of them had upset her daughter has said she is 'not a chav or a thug'.

Joanne Higgs, 33, was spared jail after  punching and pushing Lilly Hulse, 13, and Dominique Nash, 15, who had intervened to help the younger girl.

The mother-of-three claims her daughter Demi Knox, was subjected to an online bullying and harassment campaign at the hands of teenagers from Middleton Technology School, Manchester.

She said she was also forced to remove her daughter from the school after she was badly beaten up in the school grounds. 

Miss Higgs, from Middleton, said: 'I know what I did was wrong but I'm not a thug or a chav.

'I acted on how I was feeling at that time.

'I don't think I am the victim – it's my daughter who has been the victim in all this.

'She's had a nightmare.'

Bury Magistrates Court heard that she and two unknown men set upon the girls in April last year. 

The girls were said to have been punched to the ground.

Dominique Nash, 15, was attacked by mother-of-three Higgs in the street and was left with a black eye

Dominique, now 16, said she had been trying to protect her friend from attack when she was punched

But Miss Higgs – who took to a local newspaper's Facebook page to defend her actions - said she acted on her own and that no other adults were involved.

She told the Manchester Evening News she took action into her own hands after a gang of teenagers gathered outside her home and started throwing eggs at her house.

She said: 'I had tried to call the police to tell them about it.

'These kids were taunting me in the street, they were hanging round my house. There were shouting abuse at me and my daughter.

'I had tried to resolve it with the school and some of the parents after the fight but had no joy.

'I just wanted them to stop harassing my daughter. She'd already suffered enough.

'On April 1, I came home from work and there were 15 kids outside.

'My two other children were inside and they screaming.

'The kids were threatening to smash my windows. I called the police but they never came.

'I just wanted it all to stop once and for all.' 

Miss Higgs was given a suspended sentence of 15 weeks for each assault and ordered to pay compensation to the victims.

She added: 'I want to put all this behind me.

'All I want is peace my daughter and my family. Demi has had no happy years at school.'

Middleton Technology School said the school was 'dismayed and disgusted that our students were attacked in this way by an adult.'

An earlier version of this article suggested that Dominique Nash had bullied Demi Knox. We are happy to clarify that Ms Nash was part of a group of youngsters standing outside a corner shop and came to Lilly Hulse’s help when she was attacked by Joanne Higgs, and was then attacked herself. She was not implicated in any playground dispute.
