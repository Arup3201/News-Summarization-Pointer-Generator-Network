Highly-paid footballers are often accused of feigning injury when they tumble over on the pitch.

But when Wayne Rooney went down clutching his knee after a challenge while playing for Manchester United, it was immediately clear why he was in so much pain.

The England star was left with a deep gash in his leg, a wound so serious it had to be treated in hospital.

Ouch: Wayne Rooney suffered a deep gash to his right leg and had to go to hospitalÂ

Surgeons said they were 'surprised' 
at the depth of the cut, which Rooney suffered during his club's 3-2 win
over Fulham at Old Trafford yesterday.

He was kept in hospital overnight, but was today discharged from hospital after receiving stitches.

Coleen Rooney, who was spotted dining alone in a restaurant while her 
husband was being treated, confirmed on Twitter that he had been allowed
home.

She tweeted: 'Thanks for all your get
well messages for @WayneRooney! He's home from hospital now, leg 
stitched up, but feeling ok.'

Rooney is expected to be out of 
action for about a month, which means he could miss England's World Cup 
qualifying matches against Moldova and Ukraine.

The gash is the latest in a long line of injuries the 26-year-old forward has suffered during his high-profile career.

Between 2004 and 2007, he was ruled out three times after breaking a metatarsal bone in his foot.
He has also missed games due to sprained ankles and calf strains.
