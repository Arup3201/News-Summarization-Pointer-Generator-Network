Ben Fitchett, 14, died after apparently jumping from a motorway bridge. His family said the 'popular' pupil was immensely loved.

The 'shocked and devastated' family of a 14-year-old boy who died after apparently jumping from a motorway bridge has paid tribute to an 'immensely loved son with the ability to make everybody smile'.

Police in Greater Manchester were called at 7.20am on Monday following reports someone had fallen from a bridge on the M62, eastbound, near to junction 20.

Officers attended and discovered the body of a young man who was pronounced dead at the scene.

He has now been identified as 14-year-old Ben Fitchett from Rochdale.

There are not believed to be any suspicious circumstances surrounding the teenager’s death at this stage but it does appear that the youngster jumped from the bridge.

A source said there were no indication that the death was related to bullying or harassment on social media.

The matter will be passed to the coroner once a full investigation is completed, police said.

In a statement released through Greater Manchester Police, the family said: 'Family and friends are shocked and devastated by the sudden and unexpected death of Benjamin Fitchett.

'Ben is the immensely loved son of Sarah and Peter, twin brother to Sam, grandson, nephew, cousin, friend to many, and the much loved boyfriend of Clarissa.

'He was a popular pupil at Crompton House School, and was due to return into Year 10 shortly.

'He was a dedicated and hard working pupil who excelled at history, drama and art and also recently did his Bronze Duke of Edinburgh award.

'Ben was an active member of the Royton Explorer Scouts and had only just returned from an enjoyable and amazing holiday experience in Switzerland.

'He also volunteered helping the Beaver Scouts at 12th Shaw.'

The family statement said Ben was 'a talented percussionist' who enjoyed the experience of playing alongside his proud father with the Championship Section Blackburn and Darwen Brass Band, and previously with the Oldham Music Centre.

The statement continued: 'Ben was very much into his music and particularly enjoyed listening to the group All Time Low.

'He will be fondly remembered for his fantastic sense of humour and his ability to make everyone smile.

'He touched the lives of so many people, leaving a positive lasting impression on those around him.

'His family and friends and the local community have been overwhelmed and comforted by the love, prayers and support from everybody.'

Sergeant Danny Byrne, from the serious collision investigation unit, said: 'This is a tragic incident and we are keen to establish the circumstances leading to Ben’s death.

'My thoughts are with Ben’s family at this devastating time and I ask that everyone allows them time to come to terms with what’s happened.

'If you saw a young man on Broad Lane, the bridge across the M62 close to junction 20, around 7am on Monday morning we’d be interested to hear from you.'
