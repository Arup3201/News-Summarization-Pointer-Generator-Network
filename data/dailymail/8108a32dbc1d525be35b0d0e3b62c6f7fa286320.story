Kaka has seen a lot during his 14-year professional career.

After making his debut for Sao Paulo as an 18-year-old in 2001 and being snapped up by AC Milan just two years later, the Brazilian has been crowned the best player in the world, won league titles in two countries and conquered the Champions League with the Rossoneri.

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at the highs - and a few lows - in his astonishing career.
