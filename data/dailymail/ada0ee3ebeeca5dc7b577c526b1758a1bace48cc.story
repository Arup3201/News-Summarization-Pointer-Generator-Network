Six in ten Britons consider themselves to be overweight, a study has revealed.

Despite this, fewer adults are trying to lose weight than three years ago and physical exercise is dropping in popularity, it found.

Britons are the most likely people in Europe to brand themselves overweight, according to the global health and wellness survey from analysts Nielsen.

Overweight: Six in 10 Britons consider themselves to be overweight, according to a new survey. 

And among those who do regard themselves as too heavy, 22 per cent believe they are 'somewhat' or 'very' overweight, while 38 per cent say a 'little'.

The survey of more than 30,000 adults in 60 countries found most people in Europe, or 52 per cent, see themselves as overweight, however those in Poland and Russia are the least likely to do so.

Less than half – or 46 per cent – of Britons are trying to lose weight compared with 51 per cent three years ago, the poll found. 

Among those, changing diet is the most popular method, followed by exercise. The percentage who are opting for a 'quick fix' via diet pills, bars or shakes has more than doubled. Taking medicine prescribed by a doctor has doubled. 

The most popular diet change involve eating less chocolate and sugar, followed by cutting back on fats and eating more natural, fresh foods. Four in ten simply eat smaller portions of the same food.

The study, which polled more than 30,000 respondents in 60 countries, shows that most people in Europe (52%) consider themselves overweight, while Polish (35%) and Russian (40%) people are the least likely to regard themselves overweight.

Exercise: But Britons are now more likely to look for a quick fix solution to their weight problems, and less likely to exercise to keep fit

Mike Watkins, Nielsen's UK head of business and retailer insight, said: 'Not only are fewer Britons trying to lose weight, it seems they're slowly becoming increasingly reliant on easier fixes at the expense of harder work such as changing diet and exercise.'

Around one-in-10 follow a low carbohydrate/high fat diet or another diet, while eight per cent use a slimming plan.

Britons are twice as likely to use a slimming plan and 28% more likely to cut down on processed foods, but 40% less likely to follow a low carb/high fat diet to lose weight.

Mr Watkins said: 'Britons regard sugar, salt, artificial additives, cholesterol and fat as the biggest health-related evils impacting which products they buy.

'Conversely, natural flavours, being made from fruit or veg, whole grain, fibre and protein are the most important ingredients to encourage purchasing.

'Britons, however, are much less likely than Europeans - and people globally, as a whole - to let health attributes of food products affect what they buy.'

Among the 27 food health attributes covered in the survey, Britons are most willing to pay a premium price for products that are 'all natural', 'gluten-free' or organic. 

Britons are much less likely to pay a premium for healthy attributes in foods than Europeans as a whole.
