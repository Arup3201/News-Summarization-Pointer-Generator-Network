The widow of one of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects is under investigation for allegedly assisting in buying the pressure cookers that were used to create the explosives used in the terror attack, it has emerged.

Katherine Russell, 25, the widow of bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev, is suspected of accompanying her late husband to a Macy's store in Boston two months before the April 2013 attack, where Tsarnaev purchased five pressure cookers, according to ABC News, citing law enforcement sources.

Tsarnaev and his brother, Dzhokhar, then planted two of the pressure cookers at the Boston Marathon, killing three and injuring 260, police say.

The FBI and the US Attorneys office have not commented on an investigation involving Russell, who now lives in New Jersey with her and Tsarnaev's three-year-old daughter, Zahara.

Under investigation: Katherine Russell, 25, the widow of bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev - pictured here in New Jersey in October 2014 - is suspected of accompanying her late husband to a Macy's store in Boston two months before the April 2013 attack, where Tsarnaev purchased five pressure cookers

Former life: Tamerlan Tsarnaev (right-pictured left in 2010) married Katherine Russell (pictured in her yearbook) in 2010. Russell grew up in a Christian home and later converted to Islam

However ABC has reported that a search of Tsarnaev’s home after the bombings was focused on finding clothing consistent with what was shown on a security video from the Macy's store where the cookers were bought.

Russell could face charges of misprision of a felony, or failing to notify authorities of a crime about to happen. 

Tamerlan Tsarnaev also bought $200 worth of fireworks from a store in New Hampshire, including 48 mortar shells, some of which were used in the bombs.

He was killed in a police shootout three days after the attack. 

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, his brother and Russell's brother-in-law, is currently awaiting federal trial for the unthinkable attack.

The two-month process to select a jury for the trial was completed Tuesday, authorities said, a day before opening statements in the long-awaited case are to begin.

On trial: Opening statements in the long-awaited trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev are to begin Wednesday 

Unthinkable: Tsarnaev, 21, faces the death penalty if convicted of the April 15, 2013 bombings near the finish line at the Boston Marathon which left three people dead and 264 injured in the northeastern US city

Following the bombings, an attorney for Russell released a statement saying she was cooperating with the investigation.

'As a mother, a sister, a daughter, a wife, Katie deeply mourns the pain and loss to innocent victims, students, law enforcement officers, families and our community,' the attorney, Miriam Weizenbaum, said in the statement.

Last year it was reported that Russell had remarried. 

In October Russell was pictured out in North Bergen, where she and three-year-old daughter, Zahara, are said to be living with her husband's sisters.

Zahara was just a baby when her father caused unthinkable tragedy on April 15, 2013.

As the images show, Russell, 25, continues to wear a hijab, proving that she is still living a strict Muslim life despite rumors that her family had been pushing her to embrace Christianity after the attacks.

Russell grew up Christian in the North Kingston, Rhode Island, home of a suburban doctor.

Possible suspect: Katherine Russell could face charges of misprision of a felony, or failing to notify authorities of a crime about to happen

Out and about: Russell, from Rhose Island, converted to Islam after meeting Tsarnaev in a nightclub. She is seen here in North Bergen, New Jersey, in October

At home: She reportedly now lives with her husband's two sisters at the home in North Bergen

Russell grew up Christian in the North Kingston, Rhode Island, home of a suburban doctor.

In 2010, the promising young artist and good student dropped out of college, converted to Islam and married Tamerlan, whom she had met at a nightclub. The couple had a daughter.

The young family moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where they settled in a cramped apartment and attended prayers in a Boston Islamic center.

After her husband's death, Russell went to live with her parents in Rhode Island. They reportedly tried to convince her to stop being so strict about her faith.

Russell's attorney Amato DeLuca claimed his client first learned that her husband was suspected of being a terrorist from news reports on TV.

DeLuca said Russell had no reason to suspect her husband of anything and was focused on supporting her family, working 70 to 80 hours, seven days a week as a home health care aide.

Russell has never spoken publicly about the bombings and she was never charged in relation to the plot, although a grand jury looking into the bombings spoke with her family members.
