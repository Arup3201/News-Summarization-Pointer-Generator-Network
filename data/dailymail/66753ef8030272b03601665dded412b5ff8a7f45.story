Tiger Woods was pictured giving his children hugs during the second day of practice at Augusta National Golf Club ahead of The Masters 2015. 

He was also joined on the course by long-term skier girlfriend Lindsey Vonn. 

The former World No1 has returned to action after taking a break from golf to recover from a series of niggling injuries and rediscover his form. The first practice session on Monday had been Woods' first public appearance for 60 days.

Despite now being placed at 111th in the World Rankings, Woods believes the hiatus has done him good and he is in the right shape to win the 15th major of his career. 

'I felt like I had to get my game into a spot where I could compete to win a golf tournament,' he said. 'And it's finally there.'

Woods has not won a major since the US Open in 2008 and the last of his four Masters wins was a decade ago, with the American only confirming on Friday that he would compete at Augusta this year.
