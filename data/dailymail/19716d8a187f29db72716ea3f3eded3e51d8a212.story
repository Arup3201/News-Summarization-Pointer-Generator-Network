Shopping for clothing has always been something of a hit-and-miss affair for men. 

Finding the perfect attire usually requires patience, luck and several frustrating hours behind a changing room curtain.

But the process could soon become a lot simpler thanks to a German firm fitting photo booth-like body scanners in train stations and even airports.

The machine is fitted with a 3D scanner that works by taking thousands of detailed body measurements before customers can order clothes. 

The device can be used to produce everything from underwear through to shoes completely made-to-measure.

Outfittery has been fitting photo booth-like body scanners in train stations and even airports for men 

The scanner project by the firm 'Outfittery,' based in the German capital Berlin, came about after it was revealed that many men do not even really know what size of clothing they are and as a result are put off ordering online.

'We want to create a stress free shopping experience for men, and their partners, and it has proved incredibly popular, said Julia Bosch, who founded Outfittery, with Anna Alex and Tobias Nendel. 

The 3D scan takes thousands of body measurements in a matter of minutes which can be used to create clothing

The machine will also give men clothing suggestions based on their measurements

People only need to say what items they like the look of, and we will deliver them made-to-measure.'

The company says its returns for items that do not fit are almost non-existent, making the service more efficient and wastes less time for customers and company.

Company spokesperson Alex Keil explained: 'So often men don't know their exact sizes but this new scanner measures them exactly and that means we can choose clothes that we know will fit our clients.

'Our clothes experts know what will fit if they have proper data, and this scanner produces 100 percent pure data - it cannot lie.' 

 'We are planning on making 20 such scanners and placing them in train stations and airports in the countries in which we operate.

'When thinking about where to place them we thought 'Where does an entire population pass through in a year?' and we realised these transport hubs were perfect'.'

The company is currently operating in eight European countries, and looking to expand next to Scandinavia and later this year into the UK.
