Enrolling at university is meant to be a time for widening skill sets academically, but many Brits are using it to broaden their horizons... well, horizontally.

According to a new survey by student newspaper The Tab, university pupils in Britain have an average of 8.2 sexual partners by the time they reach the middle of their higher education. 

11,549 students were questioned about their bedroom habits for the study, which also asked when people lost their virginity and how often they have sex.

According to the answers they received, 22 per cent of students didn't lose their virginity until they were 18 years old, with the second most popular age to have sex for the first time being 16. 

19 percent of those asked lost their virginity at 17 and 15 percent lost theirs just before the age of consent - at 15. 

A shocking 1.66 per cent of students revealed they first had sex when they were 13 years of age or younger.  

There was still a significant number of young men and women who were still waiting for the right partner though, with five per cent of people declaring that they were still virgins.

The student newspaper also compiled a list of the universities where people lost their virginity earliest. 

Seven per cent of people who took part in the study followed by Aston and Ulster with six per cent each. 

Meanwhile, one in ten students who took part in the from Lancaster University said they were still virgins, followed by nine per cent at both Kent and Royal Holloway University.
