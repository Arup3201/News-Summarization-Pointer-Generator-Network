The mother of newborn twins who died following an overdose at a scandal-hit hospital has described their deaths as 'totally avoidable' after a coroner said there were failings in their care.

Alfie and Harry McQuillan, who were born 13 weeks premature, died on November 1 2010.

An inquest into their deaths heard they had been given an 'excessive' dose of morphine hours after their birth at Stafford Hospital on October 30.

The twins' mother Ami Dean, 25, from Stafford, said: 'I could have coped with them dying from prematurity, as that would have been nobody's fault. However, their deaths were totally avoidable. They were down to human error, which is something I cannot cope with.'

Both babies were described as being in a 'good condition' after their births but they were injected with morphine to stabilise their fragile bodies before they were transferred to a maternity unit.

But staff were confused over the dilution of the drug which led to Alfie being given 600mg while Harry was injected with 850mg - compared to a prescribed dose of 50mg.

A quantity of Naloxone, used to combat morphine overdoses, was prepared but was not administered as the twins were stable on a ventilator.

Within hours of the overdose the twins’ condition rapidly deteriorated and they were rushed to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire but they died on November 1.

An inquest at Cannock Coroners Court heard the twins died after suffering from lung injuries and bleeding around the brain.

Maggie Oldham at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Stafford Hospital, said: 'Our deepest sympathy remains with Alfie and Harry's parents'

Recording a narrative verdict, South Staffordshire Andrew Haigh said: 'There were failings in the care the twins received but I do not find these to be gross.

'I do not therefore propose to include a rider of neglect.'

However, he added that he believed the morphine was likely to have played a role in the children’s deaths and therefore they did not die of natural causes.

He continued: 'I realise that what happened was distressing for all involved.

'I’m pleased that the parents of the twins did manage to attend the hearing and I hope it was helpful to them.

'The circumstances of the deaths were particularly tragic and I’m sorry this happened to them.'

Mr Haigh said he would also make a report to Stafford Hospital advising them to introduce pre-filled syringes of specific doses of morphine to prevent similar tragedies in the future.

Maggie Oldham, chief operating officer at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Stafford Hospital, said: 'Our deepest sympathy remains with Alfie and Harry's parents and their loved ones.

'We are very sorry that the care we provided was not good enough.This has been a long and difficult process for their entire family and our thoughts remain with them at this time.'

Police investigated the twins' deaths, which occurred just 20 months after a report showed appalling standards of care at Stafford Hospital put patients at risk and led to some dying, but decided there was no criminal case.
