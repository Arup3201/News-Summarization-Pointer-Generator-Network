Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has urged the club to commit Jordan Henderson and Raheem Sterling to long-term contracts.

The former England skipper will bring his 28-year association with the club to a close this summer when he joins Los Angeles Galaxy but is keen to see Liverpool build a legacy of success.

With Daniel Sturridge and Philippe Coutinho both recently signing new deals, Gerrard urged manager Brendan Rodgers and the club's hierarchy to tie down Sterling and Henderson as a priority.

Gerrard was speaking to Sportsmail columnist and former team-mate Jamie Redknapp for an interview to be screened on Sky Sports ahead of their coverage of the Merseyside derby between Everton and Liverpool on Saturday night.

When asked by Redknapp about Sterling's excellent form, Gerrard said: 'Liverpool need to sign up Raheem now. And Jordan Henderson too.

'When I was coming through, once I had a couple of years remaining, my contact would be renewed to avoid the worry.

'I see Jordan with a year left and Raheem's [contract situation] in the paper too much and I know there's no smoke without fire.

'My message to the club is: get these done. Sharpish.

'Sterling, Henderson, Sturridge and Coutinho, who has just signed, are the future of this club. I want to watch them delivering trophies for Liverpool.'

Gerrard, 34, who is closing in on his 700th appearance for the club, also tipped Jordon Ibe for a bright future.

The Liverpool academy product, 19, has just been recalled to Anfield following a successful loan spell at Championship side Derby County in the opening half of the season.

Gerrard said of the youngster: 'he's got everything. He's got a bit of Sturridge and Sterling rolled into one and if he keeps listening to the right people, he will be one for England.'
