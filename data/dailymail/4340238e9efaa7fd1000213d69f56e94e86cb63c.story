Almost 90 years after her passing, a New Jersey nun credited with restoring a blind man's sight will be the first person beatified on U.S. soil in a historic honor.

Sister Miriam Teresa Demjanovich, of the Sisters of Charity in Convent Station, NJ., will be beatified Saturday in a Mass of Beatification at Newark's Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart.

The move is an important step on the road to becoming a saint, following be venerated for heroic virtue but preceding the final step of having a a second miracle attributed to them.

In her case, devotional writings - cut short by her untimely death at the age of 26 in 1927 - became very inspirational to Roman Catholics and were credited with a medical miracle decades after she passed.

The Bayonne native was even credited with having opinions that would shape the church as we know it, The Wall Street Journal reported.

'She
 brought up what Vatican II was all about: the importance of scripture, 
the importance of the trinity, the place of liturgy,' Sister 
Kathleen Flanagan, a professor at the College of Saint Elizabeth in 
Convent Station, told reporters.

Taking place in the early 1960s, Vatican II was an ecumenical council and pivotal moment for a Catholic Church seeking to redefine itself for the modern era, changing the institution's identity with changes such as having the mass spoken in the modern vernacular instead of Latin. 

Candidates for sainthood must fulfill multiple requirements, including one miracle that could be tied to their intercession which must be confirmed by the Vatican.

Demjanovich's first miracle is said to be the sight of Michael Mencer, who as an 8-year-old in Teaneck, N.J., suffered from juvenile macular degeneration, which has no known cure.

Now 59, Mencer says his vision was once so poor that Dr. Mary Mazzarrella and his family registered him with the New Jersey Commission for the Blind.

He claims that in 1964 his eyesight was restored after his teacher gave him items relating to Demjanovich.

The item was reportedly a prayer card and a strand of Miriam Teresa's hair that had been preserved in plastic.

Mencer told NBC News that he decided to walk home alone that day, despite having only peripheral vision. 

'I was about two blocks from the house when I think it happened,' he told reporters. 'I looked up at what I thought was the sun, and it didn't hurt my eyes, but I could see an orb, a bright light. And when I looked back down I could see the hair in the memento.'

After that, he ran home. 

He says his affliction never came back.

In 1971, his mother wrote a letter about the miraculous cure to the Trenton diocese's newspaper when she spotted a story about Demjanovich.

The letter was lost until 1998 when a sister discovered it stuck between two file folders while cleaning out some cabinets.

Mazzarrella said she had consulted with 18 other doctors about his condition and a seven-member panel of opthalmologists.

The doctors told her the recovery was 'medically unexplainable.'

For Demjanovich to be canonized, the church also had to be shown that others had prayed for Demjanovich's intercession before the boy was cured.

Demjanovich
 was the youngest of seven children born to an immigrant family from 
what's now known as Slovakia, and was baptized in Byzantine-Ruthenian 
Catholic Church before attending public schools in Bayonne.

In 1923, she graduated summa cum laude from the College of Saint Elizabeth with a degree in literature.

She was first suggested for sainthood in 1945 when her family asked the Bishop of Paterson, N.J., to initiate 'cause.'

In Rome, her case was overseen by the Vatican's Congregation for the Causes of Saints, which oversees canonization.

They interviewed people who knew her as well as poured over her writings, including plays, poems, letters, meditations, and a piece of an autobiography.

The meditations were especially important in establishing sainthood.

They were published just one year after her death under the title, 'Greater Perfection.'

Fewer than a dozen native-born U.S. citizens have been granted beatification by the Catholic Church and of those only three have finally been canonized.

The Vatican's head of Congregation for Saints' Causes will attend Saturday's mass.

Having the ceremony in Newark makes 'beatification more personal,' said Jim Goodness, spokesman for the Archdiocese of Newark.

'Here we have a woman who was born in Bayonne and lived in New Jersey,' he said. 'It allows us to really be able to understand there are saints and holy people among us today, and that we're all called to sainthood.'

If one more miracle is attributed to Demjanovich, she could attain sainthood in the Catholic Church
