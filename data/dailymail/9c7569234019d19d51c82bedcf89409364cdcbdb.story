You couldn't really blame him for taking a curtain call.

The Duchess of Cambridge might have been queen of Centre Court but yesterday – for the moment at least – Andy Murray was king.

Having roared to victory in straight sets against Frenchman Richard Gasquet, he performed an extravagant bow towards Kate and William in the royal box.

Never mind the royal wave... Kate, Duchess of Cambridge looks expectantly over at her husband as she raises her arms for the Mexican wave on Centre Court

In turn, they gave him their seal of 
approval with a pat on the back after the match, won in 32c (100f) heat on 
court, and told him: 'Well done.'

Murray said: 'If I'd known they were 
coming, I would have shaved. I was thinking to myself as I came off I 
was sweaty and very hairy. I said to them, "I'm sorry, I'm a bit 
sweaty". But it was very nice to get to meet them.'

The bow, he said, was 'just, yeah, 
sort of off the cuff. Didn't think too much about it'. He added: 'I was 
obviously very happy after the match. I think it was the right thing to 
do.'

The win earns Murray a quarter-final clash tomorrow with the Spaniard Feliciano Lopez.

Pretty layering: Kate followed Wimbledon's specification that players must wear white

William and Kate became the surprise 
stars of the royal box after weeks of speculation that they might attend
 before embarking on their tour of Canada tomorrow.

Centre Court was crammed to capacity,
 which equates to 15,000 bums on seats. But to widespread 
disappointment, none, alas, was Pippa Middleton's.

For although there were frantic 
rumours during the morning that Kate's little sister and former maid of 
honour would arrive with the royal party, Pippa-watch was stood down at 
12.31pm when the celebrated rear failed to emerge from the 
police-escorted cavalcade.

Kate, a huge fan of the game, wore 
what looked to be a triple-decker tennis skirt – in fact a £795 Alice 
Temperley dress – teamed with LK Bennett nude court shoes.

Within half 
an hour of her appearance, the frock, reduced to £395 in the summer 
sale, had sold out on the designer's website.

Unusual detailing: The white disks on Kate's shoulders will remind Wimbledon fans of a less successful recent fashion statement... Bethanie Mattek-Sands' Lady Gaga-esque jacket which was covered in white tennis balls

The royal spectators clapped and 
cheered as Murray got to grips with the heat. Later, during Rafael 
Nadal's match, they would even join in a Mexican wave.

Murray's triumph was followed by despair
 from the Williams sisters who made a shock exit from the tournament in 
the fourth round.

Venus 
Williams' attempt to win a sixth Wimbledon title ended in the fourth 
round with a 6-2, 6-3 loss to Tsvetana Pironkova of Bulgaria.

The
 23-year-old Pironkova beat Williams at Wimbledon last year by the same 
score to reach her first Grand Slam semi-final. She also won their 
first-round match at the Australian Open in 2006.

Williams'
 defeat came shortly after younger sister Serena also went out in the 
fourth round, losing to Marion Bartoli.

It is the first time since 2006 
that neither sister has reached the Wimbledon quarter-finals.

Expert in action: Andy Murray drew in an A-list crowd for his match on Centre Court today

Fan club: Murray's girlfriend Kim Sears and his mother, Judy, were watching his progress

Support from afar: Andy Murray's tennis racket bag is covered with tweets from his fans

Kate and William appeared happy and 
relaxed as they watched the day's tennis. The Duchess has been a 
Wimbledon fan for years - as have all the Middletons.

Pippa has attended the French Open 
and the Aegon Championships since her big sister's wedding earlier this 
year and Kate has visited the championships twice before.

In 2007 she attended with a friend to watch Rafael Nadal play Swede Robin Soderling on Court One and in 2008 she visited again.

A polite thank you letter Kate wrote 
to Wimbledon bosses after her most recent visit is currently on display 
at the All England Club.

Fun day out: William and Kate's visit to SW19 is a private affair and the newlyweds will not fulfill any royal duties

More than 2,000 people queued along the grassy banks outside the club in a bid to secure places  for Murray's match.

As the fans waited outside, though, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge took up their prime positions on Centre Court.

There
 they watched a very convincing display by Britain's number one who won 
the first set in a tie-break, soon claimed the second too and broke 
early in the third set.

As well as the young royals, Murray had his more personal fan club in attendance.

His pretty girlfriend Kim Sear and his mother Judy Murray were sitting side-by-side at his fourth round match.

Murray's
 support also came from further afield, his tennis racket bag was covered 
with tweets from his legion of fans including 'stay positive we are all 
behind you' and 'believe in yourself and never give up'.

The perfect guest: Kate chatted and joked with Gill Brooke, the wife of the Chairman of the All England Tennis Club, who was sitting by her side

Top tips: Kate leant back to give Jane Henman, Tim's mother, who was sitting behind her, a kiss on the cheek before exchanging a few words with her too

Kate and William's visit to SW19 is a private 
affair and the newlyweds will not fulfill any royal duties. But they both
 appeared very contented to chat to the others sitting around them.

Kate looked as composed as we have 
come to expect from the unflappable Duchess. She chatted and joked with
 Gill Brooke, the wife of the Chairman of the All England Tennis Club, 
who was sitting by her side.

The
 relaxed tennis fan also leant back to give Jane Henman, the mother of our last big British hopeful Tim Henman, who was sitting behind her, a kiss on the cheek before exchanging a few 
words with her too.

As the royal box guests arrived, thousands of sun-drenched fans applauded. But the heartiest welcome was reserved for the young couple who were given a standing ovation.

The retractable roof was also partially pulled over to shade the royals' end of the arena.

Other Wimbledon-goers were not quite 
as lucky, they used umbrellas to shade themselves from the sweltering 
sun as they sat on other courts or watched the action on Murray Mount.
