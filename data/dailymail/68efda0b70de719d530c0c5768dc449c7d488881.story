A family has been torn apart after a man took his father's ashes from his elderly mother's garden - and is still refusing to reveal their whereabouts.

Joseph Pringle, 64, died from heart failure in 1996 and his remains were buried in his wife Ruby's back garden in Spittal in Berwick, Northumberland.

They were stored in an urn and hidden under a rose bush, where they remained for 17 years.

Plea: The heartbroken relatives of Stephen Pringle, 52, have begged him to reveal the whereabouts of his father's ashes. Above, his sister, Vivien Robson, in her mother's garden, where the ashes used to be buried

Distraught: Joseph Pringle, 64, died from heart failure in 1996 and his remains were buried in his wife Ruby's (picture, right, with Ms Robson) garden in Spittal in Berwick, Northumberland. But in November, they vanished

But in November, Mrs Pringle, now 82, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, went into the garden and discovered the urn had vanished, while the rose bush had been upended.

Following a police investigation, her eldest son, Stephen Pringle, was charged with stealing the cremated remains.

The 52-year-old appeared before Berwick Magistrates' Court on Monday, where he was found not guilty of committing a criminal offence.

But despite the outcome, Mr Pringle admits he has taken the ashes - although he is still yet to reveal their exact whereabouts to his family.

Yesterday, his mother and siblings Vivien Robson, 58, Ann Chissel, 46, and Gordon Pringle, 48, pleaded with him to disclose the location of his father's remains.

'Just let us know exactly where you have scattered my dad. We could go and put some flowers down,' said Mrs Chissel, also from Berwick.

'At the end of the day, we were all very close to my dad.'

Mrs Chissel said her brother had taken the ashes following a family row over
 a loan, and had later revealed that he had scattered them somewhere in 
Ormiston in East Lothian, Scotland.

But
 after visiting the village and raking through rubbish bins, the family 
have still not managed to recover any trace of the urn.

'It is like my dad has died all over again but now we don't have anything to show for it,' she said.

'When he died we knew where he was and now it is like that closure has been taken away from us.

'This has wrecked the whole family because we were all pretty close. When we found out this had happened, we couldn't believe it and we don't know why it has happened.'

She added: 'We believe that Stephen still has the ashes. We don't know why he is doing this to us. We would be happy if he even took us and showed us where he scattered them.

All that is left: In November, Mrs Pringle, now 82, who suffers from Parkinson's disease, went into the garden and discovered the urn had vanished, while the rose bush had been upended (pictured)

'We just want to know what has happened. It would help if we just knew.'

Mr Pringle's solicitor Ian O'Rourke said yesterday the case was the 'most extraordinary case' he has ever had to deal with, and should never have reached court.

'It was a dreadful and very sad case. This man [Stephen Pringle] did not act dishonestly at all. It has been quite a distressing case to see a family torn apart like this,' he said.

Sister: Mr Pringle has admitted taking the ashes - but is yet to reveal their exact whereabouts to his family

Mr O'Rourke said his client had admitted taking the ashes after things came to a head one night when he had taken prescribed tranquillisers.

'Stephen wanted to scatter the ashes where his father was born in Ormiston,' he said.

But he added that there is hope for the fractured family as mediation is an option, saying: 'When Stephen was interviewed by police, he was more than willing to engage in mediation.'

When approached by reporters, Mr Pringle said he did not wish to comment.
