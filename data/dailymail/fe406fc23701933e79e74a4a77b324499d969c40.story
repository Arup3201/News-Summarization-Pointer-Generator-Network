A toddler was back in the hospital Monday just days after recovering from a critical brain surgery meant to help him recover from an injury sustained during Hurricane Sandy when a tree limb struck him on the head.

Tripp Halstead, 2, from Georgia, has been was released Friday night but rushed back at about 9:30 a.m. Monday.

'Pray pray pray. In ambulance on way to hospital,' Halstead's family posted on Facebook.

Tripp Halstead was just released from the hospital Friday but has already been readmitted as his symptoms showed themselves again this weekend

Halstead recently underwent brain surgery to help him recover from being struck on the head by a branch during Hurricane Sandy

In March alone he's had four brain surgeries, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported.

Later in the day, the family said doctors were still running tests and they were unsure what was wrong.

Tripp has been hospitalized since the October 29 incident after sustaining a brain 
injury which left him in a medically induced coma.

His family said finally bringing him home Friday was their greatest moment since October but some of his symptoms returned this weekend.

Local businesses are trying to help 
the famly with their medical bills, and three Chick-fil-A restaurants 
are donating 10 per cent of sales to the family Monday afternoon.

Halstead was also taken to emergency surgery in February.

As the family raced him to the hospital they posted a message to Facebook begging friends to 'pray'

Fighting for his life: Both sides of two-year-old Tripp Halstead's brain were injured when a large branch was blown off a tree and hit him in the head

In that incident, his 
family posted a now similar message to his Facebook page: 'Please pray 
pray pray. They are taking him in for emergency surgery to remove the 
shunt and the pump.

'Tripp
has bacterial meningitis, which is very life threatening. Words can’t 
describe what we are feeling except total heartbreak.'

When he was rushed into Children’s 
Healthcare of Atlanta on the day of the incident, he had emergency 
surgery to relive swelling around his brain from where the ten-foot tree
branch struck him on the head.

Tripp’s favorite toy, Lightning McQueen, was in his hand as he remained unconscious.

A family friend set up a Facebook for Tripp's parents, Bill and Stacy Halstead, who have been posting updates on their son's condition and asking people to pray and donate money for his recovery.

The family said they have been 
overwhelmed with support from thousands of well-wishers, many of them 
strangers who have heard about Tripp’s plight from media reports, 
according to Atlanta Journal Constitution.

After the accident, the toddler's father, Bill Halstead, wrote that doctors gave them sobering news.

'His
injury is across both sides of the brain which makes it much worse. It 
is still far too early to know what the outcome will be or what the 
lasting damage could be,' the message read.

'His swelling is back up and his drainage tube is having problems,' the post said in part. 'Sounds like today is going to be the most trying day so far so please continue to pray. We still need a miracle.'

The boy's mother, Stacy Halstead, called her son a miracle baby, explaining to WSB-TV that she and her husband had struggled for a long time to conceive until finally she became pregnant with Tripp, their one and only child.

Heavy: A strong gust of wind ripped the branch from the tree before it landed on Tripp

On October 29, tragedy struck when the toddler was playing at around 11.30am outside the Cribs and Crayons day care center, CBS Atlanta reported. 

A
strong gust of wind caused a tree limb to fall, hitting the little boy 
in the neck and head. Employees from the center rushed to his aid and 
administered CPR, but the damage had been done.  

Since the accident, the boy's family have been on a roller coaster ride, going from positive signs, like a brief reduction in pressure around his brain, to serious complications, among them problems with his breathing.
