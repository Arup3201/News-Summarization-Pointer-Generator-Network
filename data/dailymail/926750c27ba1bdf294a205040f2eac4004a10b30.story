The New York Times sparked outrage on Twitter yesterday after wrongly calling Andy Murray an 'English' tennis player.

After the Scottish star made history by becoming the first British man to win Wimbledon since 1936, the newspaper posted an online story headlined: 'After 77 years, Murray and England rule'.

The story was also published on Twitter, and the gaffe was quickly seized upon by tennis fans.

Correction: The New York Times send out another Tweet, making clear that Murray is British and not English

The proud Scotsman, who grew up in Dunblane, beat Novak Djokovic yesterday in the men's final in straight sets 6-4 7-5 6-4.

Minutes after publishing the story, the New York Times corrected it - although their Tweet about Englishman Andy Murray remains online today.

The 26-year-old British player was watched in the Royal box on Centre Court yesterday by both Prime Minister David Cameron and Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond.

One Twitter user, called Kirk J Torrance wrote that he will be voting for Scottish independence because the mistake is so commonly made overseas.

'oh dear... See this is one of the reasons I'm voting #Yes in #IndyRef - the world believes that England/ Britain is interchangeable,' he wrote.

Another user, called Daniel Lewis, wrote: '99.9% of Americans so thrilled the English won Wimbledon.'

In a tongue in cheek remark, Tom Phillips joked: 'Really disappointing mistake from one of the great Canadian newspapers.'

Yesterday Alex Salmond was accused of political opportunism after unfurling a Saltire behind David Cameron's head in the wake of Andy Murray's historic Wimbledon victory.

The move was politically sensitive because Scotland is planning to hold an independence referendum in autumn 2014.

The SNP leader seemed to deliberately raise the flag behind the Prime Minister so it would be in the television shot.

Supporters of the Union also accused him of breaking All England Club rules which state that large banners and flags cannot be used around the courts.

But Mr Salmond told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that he had 'no idea' what the seating plans were, and the Wimbledon authorities had not minded his actions 'in the slightest'.

'I think it (is) a rule more observed in the breaking than the observation,' he added.

Stressing that the incident happened after the match had finished, Mr Salmond pointed out that, while Britain had waited 77 years, no Scot had won the tournament since Harold Mahoney in 1896.

'It is not something that happens very often so I think a few Saltires hoisted over Wimbledon does not do any harm at all,' he said. 'I had no idea what the seating arrangements were - that is absolutely the case.'

He said the flag had been in his wife Moira's handbag.

Asked whether Murray's achievement had been a triumph for Britain, he replied: 'Absolutely, and for tennis fans everywhere. Let everyone enjoy the triumph. But you will allow us just the little sneaky thing of the first Scot since 1896. Let us wave our Saltires.'
