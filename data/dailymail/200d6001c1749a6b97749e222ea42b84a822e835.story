'I thought it was a joke': Karen and Aidan Price were heading to New York when the incident happened

A mother was left mortified when police hauled her off a flight to New York because a passport had been reported stolen - by someone with the same.

Karen Price, 50, from North Wales, was horrified when she was taken from her friends and family as officers escorted her through tunnels at Birmingham Airport to a nearby police station to question her about the document.

But, after just half an hour, officials realised a bungling Passport Office staff member had caused the alert - marking Karen's passport down as stolen instead of her namesake's.

It transpired that it had taken them three years to note the mistake, in which time the mum-of-two had used the passport five times.

Karen, from Abergele, who was flying to New York with her husband Aidan and friends, said: ‘It was supposed to be my 50th birthday present.

‘I was just a bit shocked really, I went through check in and everything else no problems.

‘It was only when we went to board the plane it was then they took me aside and told us there was a problem. It was just a bit embarrassing.

‘The stupid thing is we had used the passport five times since it had been reported as stolen, we'd even been to Tunisia where they signed it to say that we had been let in, which proved there was no problem with the passport then.

‘I honestly thought it was a joke they were playing on me, I just couldn't believe it, I thought it was a wind-up.’

Karen tried to board the United Airlines plane on June 1 from Birmingham to Newark, New Jersey, to celebrate her birthday. 

Despite clearing check in and security with no problems, and waiting in the departure lounge for two-and-a-half hours Karen was only stopped as she stepped on to the plane.

Waiting police swooped in and demanded the NHS worker followed them to the station for further questioning.

The couple were forced to abandon their friends, who boarded the aircraft as normal, without an explanation and were led through a series of tunnels to the airport's police station.

After half an hour officers revealed the mistake and said the pair needed to attend the Passport Office to rectify the problem.

Karen and her husband Aidan were booked on a flight two days later in a hope they could still enjoy part of their six-day holiday.

‘They said we could fly Tuesday but we had to get our passport sorted out by then,’ Karen said.

‘We were ringing every hour to see if the Passport Office had a cancellation.

‘We finally managed to get an appointment at 11am on Monday so we shot straight to Liverpool to get everything processed.

‘While we were there they said another Karen Price had reported her passport stolen in January 2011 and it had only been put on the system in April 2014.

‘The only problem was it was against the wrong Karen Price.

‘I'm flabbergasted they didn't do more stringent checks to deal with the cancellation of a passport.

‘What if someone else had picked it up and had tried to use it? I'd used my passport five times.’

Karen was finally issued another passport and boarded another flight to the States.

Aidan, 49, added: ‘We had stayed with some friends ready to get to the airport in plenty of time.

‘It was a big deal, we had friends coming over to meet us and we had booked helicopter rides and excursions for the whole trip.

‘It was a once in a lifetime trip really, the whole situation was an absolute nightmare.’

Aidan added: ‘We had just a few days left when we arrived so we had to fit everything in in such a short space of time.

‘We missed the helicopter ride to had to book another one as well as another trip up the Empire State Building.

‘We had to cram so many excursions into two days everybody was knackered. It was a complete nightmare.’

Karen added: ‘Well my birthday trip will never be forgotten that's for sure.

‘Every time I go to the airport now I will be scared to death until I get on the plane. I won't be able to relax until then.’

A spokesman for Her Majesty's Passport Office said: ‘We apologise to Miss Price for the inconvenience caused.

‘It is extremely rare for passports to be cancelled in error. If a mistake does occur it is fully investigated and resolved as quickly as possible.’
