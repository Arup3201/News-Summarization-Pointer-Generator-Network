Mea culpa: Rep. Becky Carney, a Democrat, accidentally laid the passing vote for a controversial bill that allows fracking

A North Carolina state representative says she voted mistakenly to override the governor's veto of a bill to allow the shale gas exploration called 'fracking' after a late-night vote in the General Assembly.

Democratic Rep. Becky Carney of Charlotte said she pushed the green 'yes' button at her desk Monday night to override Democratic Gov. Beverly Perdue's veto of the measure that would allow shale gas exploration, before realizing she wanted to vote red, or 'no.'

After pushing the wrong button, Rep Carney could be heard saying, ‘Oh my gosh, I pushed green.’

She was told she couldn't change her vote because this would have altered the outcome.

According to Raleigh Durham’s WRAL, the Democrat turned her light on, but was not recognised by Speaker Thom Tillis and went down on the floor to speak with him.

Her 'yes' vote made the tally 72-47 - just above the 60 per cent required to override in the Republican-controlled Legislature. 

She told WRAL that she felt ‘rotten’ about the vote that allowed Gov. Perdue’s veto to be overridden, adding: ‘I made a mistake, and I tried to get recognised to change it, as people have been doing all night on other bills, and it was too late,’ she said.

‘It would have changed the outcome of the vote.’

The chamber's rules allow members to again cast their vote if they’ve made a mistake, but prevent members from changing a vote if it affects the outcome.

Rep Carney had voted earlier against fracking, and spent the days preceding the vote campaigning against the controversial process.

Republican Paul Stam, the assembly’s majority leader, told NBC 17 that fracking will not begin for some time yet.

‘It’s definitely not a fast track,’ he said. ‘It’s two years of rule-making and no drilling until another vote of the assembly two years from now.’

Rep Carney said that she’ll be on the lookout for opportunities to change the law.

What the frack? Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is the process of extracting natural grass from shale rock layers deep within the Earth
