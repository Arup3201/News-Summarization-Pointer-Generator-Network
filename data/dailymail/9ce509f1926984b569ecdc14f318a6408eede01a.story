A man who was diagnosed with an extremely aggressive form of cancer two years ago is now amazingly in remission thanks to a revolutionary treatment that involved receiving an infusion of the virus that causes AIDS.

Marshall Jensen of Utah, was one of 30 leukemia patients to undergo a trial treatment at Penn Medicine recently, in which white blood cells are implanted with a harmless form of HIV programmed to target and kill cancer.

The 30-year-old married father of one has so far responded well to the treatment and is now cancer-free for the first time in years.

The 30-year-old Utah man was one of 30 patients in an experimental trial, who received doses of the deactivated HIV virus, which act as cancer killing fighters in the body. Of those who underwent of the treatment, 23 are still alive and 19 are now in remission

Jensen, wife Amanda and their young son Kezman have been travelling the country ever since he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 2012, just one year after their marriage, searching for an effective treatment for his cancer.

'They were a young couple. They weren’t married very long. They had a brand new little baby when all of this started,' neighbor Lindsay Wright told KSL.

The Jensens didn't find success though until they met Dr Carl June at Penn Medicine. Dr June and his team of physicians have spent two decades working on a breakthrough experimental treatment using the HIV virus. 

On Thursday, Jensen was welcomed back to his Utah neighborhood, after travelling the U.S. these past two years for treatment

'We were calling it our Hail Mary pass,' Marshall Jensen said. 'It felt right. … We didn't know how we were going to get out there, what we were going to do, but it worked. By God's grace I was able to come back.'

On Thursday, a healthier Jensen returned to his neighborhood in Utah to a surprise homecoming celebration. 

The connection between leukemia and HIV was first discovered in 2006, when an HIV-positive man named Timothy Ray Brown was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. After receiving a bone marrow transplant from a donor with a rare genetic mutation, Brown's cancer went into remission and the HIV disappeared from his system making him the first man to ever be fully cured of the virus.  

Dr June is now looking to use the treatment to combat other types of cancer. Jensen (right) pictured above with his wife (left) and their son (center) 

Since then, Dr June and his team have been working vigilantly on developing a HIV-based treatment for leukemia and this October, published a study showing the therapy's success on 30 cancer patients.

The patients who received the treatment had billions of T-cells extracted from their body, which were taken to a lab and implanted with deactivated HIV. The 'serial killer' cells are then put back into the body to fight and kill cancer, and remain dormant until the cancer reappears. 

While the idea of receiving a dose of HIV may seem scary to some, Dr June says there's nothing to fear about the stripped-down virus used in the treatment. 

'It's a disabled virus, but it retains the one essential feature of HIV, which is the ability to insert new genes into cells,' Dr June explained. 

Of the 30 leukemia patients who received the treatment, comprised of five adults and 25 children, 23 are still alive and 19 are in remission. 

Seven-year-old Emma Whitehead was the first child to receive the treatment in 2012, and has been cancer-free for two years now. 

Dr June and his team are now looking at using the HIV treatment to attack other forms of cancers, and will be starting trials this summer for pancreatic cancer patients.

He found a solution at Penn Medicine, where he was accepted into a trial to receive an experimental new gene therapy

The treatment involved implanting white blood cells with deactivated HIV and injecting them back in the body to fight off cancer

Of the 30 patients involved in the trial, 23 are still alive and 19 are in remission - like Jensen
