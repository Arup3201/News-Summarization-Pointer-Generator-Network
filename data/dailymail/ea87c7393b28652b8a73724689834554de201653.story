They get a 3-0 win away to Aston Villa and all of a sudden Mesut Ozil is world class and everything is brilliant again. One Gooner even said to me: 'It was a great weekend because all our rivals dropped points!' Rivals for what? Top four? I think you’ll find Southampton won.

Minimal expectation means Arsenal fans are satisfied way too easily, and so Arsene Wenger manages the club under no pressure whatsoever.

Let’s put some perspective on this result for Arsenal at the weekend.

Ozil looked good against a side with Philippe Senderos at the heart of their defence. A centre half who spent years at Arsenal gradually getting worse and worse.

A Villa team that cost a fraction of Ozil’s left foot were well beaten in the end. But they started the better side before the blitz of goals that killed the game well before half time.

The virus that hit the Villa camp robbed them of their man of the match at Liverpool the previous week, centre half Nathan Baker. And crucially, midfielder Ashley Westwood missed out – more on him later. Andi Weimann had to come off because he was feeling so ill, and Fabian Delph was also struggling. Paul Lambert confirmed afterwards that some of the staff had also been affected by the illness.

Aston Villa should be beaten by Arsenal, if you factor in quality and price of players and relative experience of the managers. Lambert was spot on when he said that to beat a side like Arsenal you can’t afford to have a virus spreading through the camp. No virus at Anfield helped Villa secure victory.

And this thing Gooners keep banging on about with Ozil – they tell me he’s brilliant in his best position, behind the striker. Yet they still defend a manager who’s taken more than a season to work that out?

Arsenal have spent the last decade beating opponents they should beat and getting too much praise for it. And in those years, the Gunners have wondered why so many questions are asked when they get absolutely battered by Dortmund, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Chelsea.

And here we are again. Arsenal beat a Villa side that cost a pittance and was ravaged with illness, and the Dortmund debacle is forgotten by the fans. And people wonder why Wenger keeps making the same mistakes over and over and over again in the big games?

The Villa virus is so bad the training ground was due to be temporarily shut down this week. Midfielder Westwood was throwing up in the warm up and despite being named in the original XI he couldn’t start the game he was so ill. With him patrolling in front of the back four there is no way Ozil would have had such an easy day. 

If Wenger is as shrewd as his supporters believe he is, he will have realised Westwood’s absence was the key to Arsenal’s victory.

Wenger might also work out for himself that Westwood is exactly the holding midfielder Arsenal need. Gilberto Silva left the Emirates in 2008 and Arsenal haven’t had a decent anchorman since. 

Ron Burgundy would have been better than some of the players Wenger has tried to slot in that role.

At the end of it all, it’s a win, a goal an assist and a good performance from Ozil. So, 'When will I give Wenger credit?' I hear Gooners ask. When he deserves it, is my reply.
