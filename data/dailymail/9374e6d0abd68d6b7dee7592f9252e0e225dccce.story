Sometimes it can really feel like the heavens are smiling down on you. That was certainly the case for Ken Butler and his team at Warwick Boat Club who spotted this upside down rainbow during a morning’s rowing on the Avon.

‘We’d just put the boat on the water and were about to set off when we just looked up and noticed it,’ the 65-year-old businessman said yesterday. ‘None of us knew what it was. It was the same colours as a rainbow, but upside down. There was a lot of head scratching as we marvelled at it.

‘The striking thing was it was really high up in the sky and the clarity of the colour was intense and far more distinct than you see in a normal rainbow. Above the arc, the sky was clear blue. Either side there were two columns of cloud and the arc just hung between those columns.

‘It made me think of a rope ladder like you might see across a massive ravine in a film like Raiders of the Lost Ark, but this was a beautiful rope ladder between columns of cloud.’ 

Marvellous: The upside down rainbow - known as a circumzenithal arc - witnessed by Ken Butler hanging over the river Avon 

The dazzling vision witnessed by Mr Butler, who photographed it on his smartphone, is in fact called a circumzenithal arc by scientists. In non-science terms, they only happen way up high and when skies are blue, and when ice crystals are around.

Unlike a rainbow, the sky has to be clear of rain and low cloud for them to be seen. Even then, the arc only appears when a low sun shines at a specific angle through a thin veil of cirrus clouds at 20,000-25,000ft.

At this altitude clouds are made of ice crystals, the size of grains of salt, which when lined up horizontally refract and deflect the light into an arc mirroring the sun.

Mr Butler, of Warwick, photographed this one around 10am last Tuesday, alongside the branches of an ancient oak tree. He and his fellow rowers then completed their 6 mile training trip.

‘When we got back I felt we’d really earned that smile,’ he said. ‘Afterwards I looked up what it was on the internet and discovered sightings are quite rare.

‘This one was very, very clear and all the more impressive as the landing stage is near the walls of Warwick Castle.’

A Met Office spokesman said: ‘Circumzenithal arcs, sometimes known as Bravais’ arcs, are formed when sunlight refracts through horizontal ice crystals at such an angle that the light enters the crystal through its flat top face and exits through a side prism face causing the distinctive upside-down rainbow effect.

‘They are commonly associated with cirrus clouds where ice crystals readily form.

‘Circumzenithal arcs are actually quite common as these types of clouds occur throughout the year, however we only sometimes see them as they are usually obscured by clouds underneath.

‘In order to be able to see a circumzenithal arc, a combination of atmospheric conditions must coincide just right. The height, depth and position of the ice clouds must be right as the cloud needs to be at a specific angle convex to the sun.

‘The position of the observer is also important since its visibility can vary greatly over short distances.’
