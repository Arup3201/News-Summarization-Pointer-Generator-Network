George Groves made a fist of making the statement he needed, even though he could not quite apply the exclamation required to put the seal on his winning of the European super-middleweight title.

This victory over defending champion Christopher Rebrasse brings with it not only a belt but the prospect of a mandatory challenge to WBC world champion Anthony Dirrell.

As evidence that his self-belief and ring-craft have survived that knock-out from hell by Carl Froch, this performance was impressive enough.

But Groves will need to bounce back significantly higher when and if he takes on Dirrell and he must hope that his new German promoters have pockets deep enough to make the Ameican an offer to come to Wembley which he cannot afford to refuse.

The Saint is capable of raising his game, again, and has earned the right to prove as much.

Although he admitted: ‘I want to knock people out and I couldn't do that, But I gave it a real good go.’

The loyal Londoners in Wembley Arena were satisfied with that and roared their approval of a self-assessment as honest as the fight was entertaining.

If not 80,000 at the Stadium next door when he was knocked into the blue yonder by Froch, who was at ringside commentating for Sky, an attendance of 6,300 in the Arena was highly respectable after two defeats by the Nottingham Cobra.

Groves is now the European champion but has his sights set on winning the world title next

Groves knew he needed to make an impression and raced into the fight at blistering speed, winning the first seven rounds on my card.

The left jab was piston-like in the first half of the bout and the right hooks razor sharp. But the longer the Frenchman survived the more he edged into the affair and there was slight frisson of concern about Groves' stamina.

He conceded that he had to pace himself in the later stages, which was acceptable since he risked punching himself out.

Rebrasse edged a round or two towards the end. And he raised his own question mark about the Saint’s power by dropping his hands after being caught with a snappy combination and beckoning his challenger forward.

The verdict was decisive enough, 118-110 according to two of the judges and 117-111 on the card of the other. I had Groves winning by 118-112.

Groves entered the ring to a Shakespearean reading of ‘Cry God for England, Harry and St George,’ followed’ by his brass band’s rendition of ‘When the Saints Go Marching In’ and roars from his army of fellow Londoners. There were boos, of course, for the European champion from France. Groves was businesslike from the first bell, dictating with his left jab and landing some early right crosses. The odd flurry came from Rebrasse but it was clearly Groves’ round.

He maintained the blistering opening pace in the second session but Rebrasse changed up a gear and was more competitive in the exchanges. Groves was clearly going for a quick finish but his face reddened, even though this was another impressive round.

Rebrasse was rocked by a succession of big rights but fought back, to the disappointment of fans sensing blood. Groves was also working well to the body but there was no sign yet of the Frenchman wilting despite the punishment.

At the start of the fourth, the pace had to slow a little but Groves was still dictating from behind a ramrod left jab. Rebrasse did stop him in his tracks with a solid right and Groves walked onto another at the bell but it was still the Saint's round.

Groves, fully committed on the front foot, continued to be first with the jab. It helped that Rebrasse did not appear to have the power to hit him like Froch, even though he was throwing defence to the wind at times and getting caught by some counters.

Rebrasse was enjoying a little more success as the fight approached the midway mark while Groves was losing a little accuracy and was forced on to the retreat for the first time. But it was still not quite enough to stop the rounds slipping away from the Frenchman. 

Rebrasse was presumably hoping Groves would weaken late – as he did twice against Froch – but there was no sign of it by the seventh stanza. Another Saintly round, even though this was again a little closer.

Rebrasse was holding the middle or the ring and fully in the fight by the eighth and came out equal from a thunderous exchange on the ropes – and in a round for the first time.

Groves was missing more and his corner was urging him to keep the initiative but he had to ride more accurate French combinations and lost a round for the first time with three to go.

The challenger landed big-time lefts and rights but Rebrasse took the shots, dropped his hands and beckoned the Saint forward – somewhat unwisely. Groves found a second wind to raise his work-rate again after the disappointment of the ninth to win this one but looked the more weary as they trudged back to their corners.

Rebrasse landed the cleaner punches in the penultimate round, while the big blows from Groves were more sporadic. Although he had the decision - and with it the title – in his pocket, he dropped another round.

Groves was blowing – but still throwing, albeit mostly off target or blocked punches. His chin withstood a big right – before the new and old European super-middleweight champions embraced at the final bell.

Luke Campbell continued his fine form against Krzysztof Szot on the undercard at Wembley Arena

Groves speculated that he could fight Froch for a third time, although the Cobra will be having no truck with the appeal, no matter how loudly the local fan club scream at him.

The Cobra has bigger fish to fry, if he decides to box again.

But the Saint is back, on the road to redemption, chasing a world title of his own.  

Meanwhile, earlier in the evening there were victories for the Yafai brothers Kal and Gamal. The former, and elder, stopped Herald Molina in the second round while his sibling went the six-round distance with Sofiane Bellahcene.

There was also an eighth straight win for Luke Campbell who knocked out Krzysztof Szot in the seventh. He faces a much tougher task against Daniel Brizuela in Hull next month.
