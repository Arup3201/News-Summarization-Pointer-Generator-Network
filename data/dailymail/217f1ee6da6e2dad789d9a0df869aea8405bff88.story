Rookie full backs Nathaniel Clyne and Kieran Gibbs offered an encouraging glimpse into the future by playing an important part in breaking down Slovenia at Wembley.

With no Leighton Baines, Glen Johnson and Ashley Cole on show, it was left to the newer generation to shine.

And they made light of the fact they only had four caps between them before the game – compared to the 180 won in total by the aforementioned trio.

Nathaniel Clyne was comfortable in his own half and a threat going forward for England

England defender Kieran Gibbs also impressed against Slovenia after stepping in for Leighton Baines

Clyne and Gibbs are thoroughly modern full backs; quick, mobile and equally comfortable in either half of the pitch.

They didn't lack in confidence either. Clyne, 23, was first to impress on his international debut. During a turgid opening 45 minutes, he was England's brightest attacking hope, one attacking burst left his marker flat-footed down the right-hand side led to a good chance for Raheem Sterling

Clyne is a cool customer, his development in south London at Crystal Palace was a tough schooling and he has progressed nicely on the south coast at Southampton, who sit second in the Premier League.

Given the nod ahead of ex-Southampton youngster Calum Chambers, Clyne took up advanced positions early on, always available to playmaker Jack Wilshere, and there was encouraging inter-play with Danny Welbeck down the right-hand side.

Gibbs of Arsenal took longer to settle but can look back on the game with equal satisfaction, despite being England's only player in the book for catching Valter Birsa down the back of the leg as the Slovenian tried to shield the ball.

To show his resolve, Gibbs responded immediately by winning the ball back and forcing a corner that led to Phil Jagielka's header being saved by Samir Handanovic.

After England levelled, Gibbs – who will face long-term competition from Baines and Manchester United teenager Luke Shaw for his place – seemed to get forward even more.

And he played an important part between Adam Lallana and Raheem Sterling to help set up England's best goal of the evening, Danny Welbeck's third in a 3-1 victory.

For so long, England were sluggish against Slovenia. If anything it was the energy of the two inexperienced defenders that kept them going through a difficult period.

One senses Clyne and Gibbs will be given another chance by Hodgson, maybe in Scotland on Tuesday, though Shaw is also available for that one.

Leighton Baines was forced out of the side due to an injury picked up in England training

England boss Roy Hodgson was more than satisfied with the young duo's performance.  

'I thought Nathaniel was excellent in his first game,' said Hodgson after the 3-1 win. 

'He and Kieran Gibbs did well, particularly as Gibbs only got his call to play quite late because Leighton was going to be in the team. 

'The two of them played high up the field like we wanted them to and they defended very solidly. 

'Nathaniel has to be delighted with his debut and he and Danny Welbeck would have challenged Jack for his man of the match. But I thought Jack was outstanding.'
