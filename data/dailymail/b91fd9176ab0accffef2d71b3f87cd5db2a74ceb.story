Pop icon Kate Bush has asked fans not to film or take pictures of her comeback gigs that start next week. 

The singer will play a 22-night residency at London's Hammersmith Apollo, beginning next Tuesday.

The venue was the scene of her last gig on May 14, 1979 - when it was known as the Hammersmith Odeon.

At that time, mobile phone technology and home computing were only in their infancy. 

And she has urged her fans to refrain from using mobile phones and tablets to record, or take pictures, of the upcoming tour.

Writing on her website, she said: 'I have a request for all of you who are coming to the shows. We have purposefully chosen an intimate theatre setting rather than a large venue or stadium. 

'It would mean a great deal to me if you would please refrain from taking photos or filming during the shows. I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras. 

'I know it's a lot to ask but it would allow us to all share in the experience together.'

The Wuthering Heights singer has asked fans not to film, or take pictures, of her upcoming gig

The Wuthering Heights singer is not the first musician to criticise gig-goers who spend their time  using their mobile devices rather than  watching the show.

Roger Daltrey, The Who frontman, recently said it was 'weird' that people seemed to spend more time on their phones than watching a show.

He said: 'I feel sorry for them, I really feel sorry for them. Looking at life through a screen and not being in the moment totally - if you're doing that, you're 50 per cent there, right? It's weird. I find it weird.'

Performance artist Marina Abramovic also recently barred visitors to her exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery in London from bringing in their devices, so they could focus more on the art she was creating. 

Bush's live comeback tour sold out in less than 15 minutes when tickets were released in March this year.   

She soared to fame in 1979 with her single Wuthering Heights, which she wrote when she was just 18.

Shy of publicity, Bush has become respected for her uncompromising individualism and her comeback tour sold out in less than 15 minutes 

The song based on Emily Brontë's dark love story of the same name was followed by hits including Babooshka and Running Up That Hill. 

Shy of publicity, she became respected for her uncompromising individualism and refusal to make pop music in anything other than her own style. 

She was just 20 when she completed The Tour Of Life with three dates at what was then called the Hammersmith Odeon, after topping the charts with Wuthering Heights the previous year, becoming the first woman to go to number one singing one of her own songs.

Over the years, theories about her absence from the stage have included her perfectionism, a fear of flying and the death of one of the tour crew, lighting director Bill Duffield, during a show.

But in a rare interview with Mojo magazine in 2011 to mark a comeback from one of her lengthy recording silences, she explained that her years of absence from the touring circuit were simply down to the sheer exertion of a show.

She said: 'It was enormously enjoyable. But physically it was absolutely exhausting.'
