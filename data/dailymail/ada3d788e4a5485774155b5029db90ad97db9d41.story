A Kenyan Intelligence report leaked yesterday revealed the target of this weekend’s CIA raid in Somalia - and confirmed that the British terrorist known as the 'White Widow' helped to plot a series of planned attacks in the region.

Navy SEAL Team Six was seeking for Abdulkadir Mohamed Abdulkadir when it targeted a beach home near Mogadishu, according to the report.

The attack was initially believed to have targeted  al-Shabaab strongman Ahmed Abdi Godane or a Chechen terrorist known as Abu Ciyad.

An imminent threat: al-Shabaab terrorists, seen here, are believed to pose a worldwide security threat

Abdulkadir, a Kenyan militant who has planned multiple attacks against his home country, somehow escaped the pre-dawn raid. 

Known as Ikrima, he has been previously labelled as the lead planner of al-Qaeda linked plots to bomb the Kenyan Parliament building and the United Nations offices in the Kenyan capital Nairobi.

Al-Shabaab has bragged that it knew SEALS planned to storm the beach house, which may have contributed to them being in a position to fight the elite commandos off.

The intelligence report fails to 
directly link Abdulkadir to the Westgate Mall attacks that saw over 60 
people executed – but, in a note dated one year to the day before the 
siege began, claims the extremist was planning an attack against either the shopping center or Holy Family Basilica.

Close proximity: The Navy SEAL raid in the coastal town of Baraawe was about 130 miles south of Mogadishu

The Navy SEALs operation in Somalia underscores the threat posed by the convergence of insurgent groups, particularly al-Shabab and the Yemen-based al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, according to an intelligence analyst.

Ikrima is ‘someone who is truly a go-between between al-Shabab, AQAP and probably al-Qaeda central,’ said Frank Cilluffo, director of George Washington University's Homeland Security Policy Institute.

‘What you're seeing is some of the pooling of these various entities and between various organizations,’ Mr Cilluffo continued. ‘And you are starting to see convergence of individual actors and of even planning and operations.’

The U.S. is going after top-level 
terrorists who are targeting foreign and Western interests, rather than 
internal Somali targets, Mr Cillufo noted.

Wanted: Samantha Lewthwaite, known as the 'White Widow,' is one of the world's most hunted terrorists

The report also shed more light on the terror links of Samantha Lewthwaite, who was named as a 'key actor' in an planned attack on Kenya's parliament and UN buildings.

The so-called ‘White 
Widow’ - the world’s most wanted woman - is also said to have been part 
of a terrorist cell targeting Kenyan Defence Force camps, Western 
embassies and the assassination of the country’s top politicians.

It is the first time the mother-of-four has been named in connection with the plots
which were foiled by the Kenyan authorities, underlining her importance
to Somali-based, Al Qaeda-inspired terror groups.

She gained her fearsome reputation after her husband, Germaine Lindsay, helped bomb the London transport network in the 7/7 attacks of 2005.
