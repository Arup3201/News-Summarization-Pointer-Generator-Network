Tony Blair's religious charity has links to an Islamic extremist group being investigated by MI5 and MI6, it has been alleged.

It has been claimed that two Muslim leaders, who have ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, are advising The Tony Blair Faith Foundation.

The organisation has been declared a terrorist group in Egypt and Saudi Arabia, and could be banned in Britain, despite insisting they do not have links to extremist factions.

The Global Muslim Brotherhood Daily Watch, which has been looking into the group for 13 years, revealed that Dr Ismail Khudr Al-Shatti, an adviser to the Kuwaiti government and a member of Mr Blair’s advisory council, is a leading member of the Kuwaiti branch of the Muslim Brotherhood. the Islamic Constitutional Movement (ICM).

He is said to have told a crowd of Kuwaitis protesting over Palestine: 'Israel is an evil, and we can never live with evil,' according to a news agency report in 2000.

In 1995, it was reported in America that a Palestinian terrorist group wrote to him requesting funds.

Another Islamic adviser to Mr Blair is Mustafa Ceric, a Bosnian Muslim cleric who has made controversial statements about Islam in the Balkan states.

The former Grand Mufti of Bosnia-Herzegovina has been linked to the the global Muslim Brotherhood through his membership of the European Council for Fatwa and Research.

The Global Muslim Brotherhood Daily Watch says Mr Blair’s links to the Brotherhood through the men threatened to overshadow the charity's work.

Steven Merley, a US investigator of extremist movements, who runs Global Muslim Brotherhood Daily Watch, told The Sunday Telegraph: 'Many groups don’t call themselves Muslim Brotherhood but they are linked to what I call the 'Global Muslim Brotherhood’.

'These individuals have fooled a lot of politicians, like Blair, who should know better. The very presence of people like Shatti and Ceric in the same room as him is a judgment on Blair.'

The Muslim Brotherhood denies being an extremist organisation, and has asked Lord Macdonald, the former director of public prosecutions, to help defend them.

It has even threatened legal action against people who try to restrict their activities.

David Cameron has asked the British intelligence 
agencies to investigate the Islamic group, after they opened an 
international office about a disused kebab shop in Cricklewood, London.

After news of the inquiry into the activities emerged, it was revealed the group is moving its headquarters from London to Austria.

A spokesman for the Tony Blair Faith Foundation told the paper they were 'grateful' for the work done by the pair and described them as 'great supporters of the foundation'.

The oragnisation said they were not aware of the men's alleged links.
