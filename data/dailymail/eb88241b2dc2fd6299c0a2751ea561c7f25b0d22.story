She is about to strip down quite a bit as she tackles the role of Anastasia Steele in the much-anticipated big-screen adaptation of kinky novel 50 Shades Of Grey.

And it seems that Dakota Johnson is getting a running head start as she gets to work on her current movie, Cymbeline.

The 23-year-old actress was seen climbing through a window wearing just a pair of knickers and a grey vest over a lacy bra as she filmed scenes alongside co-star John Leguizamo in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn on Wednesday.

Stripping off already! Dakota Johnson was seen filming her new movie Cymbeline in a pair of knickers on Wednesday as she emerged for the first time after news of her new saucy Fifty Shades Of Grey role

The revealing attire showed off the young starlet's slender legs and pale complexion.

Dakota was filming inside what appeared to be a run down house in the area.

The actress's upcoming drama is based on the play Cymbeline written by William Shakespeare, and also stars Ethan Hawke and Ed Harris.

Daring to bare: The actress also showed a hint of her lacy purple bra underneath a grey vest

But of course all of the hype 
surrounding Dakota at the moment is in relation to her new saucy role, 
and Wednesday was the first time she has been seen since news emerged 
that she had won the lead of Anastasia.

Dakota was also seen wearing casual clothes throughout the day.

The daughter of Hollywood 
actress Melanie Griffith and actor Don Johnson, was casual in a 
loose-fitting white T-shirt and a pair of ripped denim Daisy Dukes.

Getting prepared: Dakota will no doubt be stripping down regularly to play the role of Ana in Fifty Shades Of Grey

Outdoor wear: Dakota was seen standing on a balcony with little clothes

She's not shy: The actress had no qualms about getting around in her smalls for her scenes

Wearing barely any make-up on her complexion, she wore her flaxen tresses out in a natural wave.

The actress padded around the set in a pair of slip-on flats and carried a grey knitted sweater in her hand.

Dakota and new co-star Charlie Hunnam 
will take on the roles of Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey, 
respectively, in the anticipated big-screen adaptation of the sexy 
novel.

Enjoying the sunshine: The actress was also spotted reclining on the porch soaking up a spot of sunshine

Biker babe: It appears that Dakota also gets to film scenes on a vintage motorcycle in her new movie

Ready to ride: The actress was seen carrying a bright yellow motorcycle helmet in her hands

The news was tweeted 
by author E.L. James on Monday morning: 'Good moaning all. Hold on to 
your hats...' she wrote shortly before making the announcements.

Dakota
previously appeared in The Social Network - in which she shared a love 
scene with Justin Timberlake - and had small roles in 21 Jump Street, 
The Five-Year Engagement and Beastly.

It's thought producers cast Dakota 
because they wanted a young, up-and-coming actress to play the role of 
virginal Anastasia, who embarks on an intense voyage of sexual discovery
with her S&M-loving boss Christian.

Clothes on: Earlier in the day, Dakota was spotted taking a stroll around the set

Low-key look: The 23-year-old was casual in a loose-fitting white T-shirt and a pair of ripped denim Daisy Dukes, which showed off her slender and pale legs

Natural beauty: Wearing barely any make-up on her complexion, she shielded her eyes with a pair of oversized sunglasses

Dakota's mother Melanie was certainly thrilled about the news, taking to Twitter to share her excitement.

'My beautiful child Dakota has been chosen to play Anna Steele in 50 Shades!!! Look out world! Here she comes!!!' she wrote.

Charlie, who is 33 years old and British,
stars in the dark biker series Sons Of Anarchy as Jackson 'Jax' Teller 
and also appeared in Guillermo del Toro's robot epic Pacific Rim.

Blossoming career: Dakota ruffled her blonde hair and lay back in the sun

He gained fame on the UK drama Queer 
As Folk, on which he played gay teenager Nathan Maloney; the show ran 
from 1999-2000 and was remade for American audiences by Showtime (under 
the same title).

The 
castings closed waves of rumours about who would take on the roles - 
Emma Watson, Imogen Poots, Armie Hammer and Ian Somerhalder, among many 
others, were at one time tied to a main role on the film.

Producer Michael De Luca tweeted on 
Monday that Dakota and Charlie showed great promise when they auditioned
for the roles together: 'Auditions were stunning, incredible 
chemistry!' he wrote.

Biking it up: John Leguizamo was spotted filming a scene on a motorbike in a Brooklyn Park for the same movie

Film magic: Anton Yelchin was also spotted filming in the park in a leather jacket and jeans

The duo had to do a 'chemistry read,' 
meaning a scene on video, and Charlie also had several tests with 
various actresses; he seemingly wanted to know who his co-star was 
before committing to the project, according to The Wrap.

But since news of the castings emerged, there has been considerable backlash against Dakota and Charlie playing the roles. 

Many have taken to Twitter to slam the choices and an online petition on Change.org has even been created in an effort to get the lead roles recast.

It instead suggests that Matt Bomer and Gilmore Girls star Alexis Bledel are far better choices for Christian and Anastasia.

Rough and rugged: Dakota's future co-star Charlie Hunnam, who will play the role of Christian Grey, was spotted getting back to work on his hit series Sons Of Anarchy in California on Tuesday

Screen presence: Charlie is often seen shirtless in Sons Of Anarchy and also in his latest movie Pacific Rim

The
petition reads: Matt Bomer is the PERFECT DESCRIPTION OF CHRISTIAN GREY
AND ALEXIS BLEDEL IS THE PERFECT ACTRESS TO REPRESENT ANASTASIA STEELE 
and if THEY ARE NOT, NOBODY WILL BE And I read the whole trilogy and I 
can assure that Matt is the perfect actor for this movie and Alexis too.

'So please PLEASE, all of the GREYsessed and Bomerettes in the world NEED those actors. 

'They always will be for us the Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele. WE CAN DO ANYTHING GUYS, ANYTHING.'

The petition has so far reached 20,000 signatures and is still counting. 

Petition: An online petition on Change.org has been created in an effort to get film bosses to recast Matt Bomer and Alexis Bledel as the lead roles in Fifty Shades Of Grey

Meanwhile,
it was business as usual for Matt Bomer, 35, as he filmed scenes in New
York for his USA Network series White Collar on Tuesday.

Matt looked handsome in a dark suit and, of course, white-collared shirt alongside his co-star Tim DeKay, 50.

Fifty
Shades Of Grey will be directed by Sam Taylor-Johnson (Nowhere Boy), 
based off the adapted script by Kelly Marcel (Terra Nova).

The novel is the fastest-selling paperback of all time and has sold more than 70 million copies worldwide.

Controversial
for its depictions of sadomasochistic sex and more, Fifty Shades Of 
Grey marked the rise of 'mummy porn,' or racy reading intended for 
mainstream, often middle-aged women.

The film is currently slated for release in August 2014. 

What controversy: If Matt Bomer got wind of the petition to get him cast in 50 Shades Of Grey he sure didn't show it as he filmed scenes for his series White Collar in New York on Tuesday alongside co-star Tim DeKay

Ready to wear: The 35-year-old actor certainly suited up nicely in this White Collar scenario for his role as con-man Neal
