Mike Pence, the governor of Indiana, has been criticized over plans to launch a state-run and tax-payer funded news outlet next month.

The governor, who is considering a run for the White House in 2016, is to start Just IN, a website with stories and news releases written by state press secretaries, the Indianapolis Star reported. 

It will be overseen by Bill McCleery, a former Indy Star reporter.

Indiana columnists Tim Swarens and Matthew Tully have come out criticizing the move with one labeling it as a propaganda outlet and the other calling for Pence to cancel the plans.

Tully said that Pence is a politician trying to gain more control over what the public reads about him and what he does.

Swarens called on Pence to pull the plug on the 'horrible, terrible, really no-good idea'.

Pence's media venture will feature personality profiles as well as straight news and feature stories. It also has plans to break news ahead of other media outlets, and pitch stories to reporters

Fellow journalist John Russell took his frustration out on Twitter asking for every professional journalist in Indiana to denounce the governor's state-run news service.

Publisher of a small newspaper in Portland, Indiana, Jack Ronald, told the Indy Star that the idea of elected officials presenting material that will unavoidably have a pro-administration point of view is contradictory to the idea of an independent press.

Pence's media venture is to feature personality profiles as well as straight-forward news and feature stories. It also has plans to break news ahead of other media outlets, and pitch stories to reporters and the public, according to Just IN documents.

Just IN will also include stories written by state communication directors and will operate as news outlet in 'its own right'.

Pence, who has been serving as governor since 2013 posted to social media site Twitter about the new media outlet.

He wrote: 'This is state of IN's calendar for press releases: The #JustIN website will offer the same service with a new look'.

Following a search of state employee salary data, the outlet already has two staff members who have a combined salary of $100,000, according to the Indy Star.
