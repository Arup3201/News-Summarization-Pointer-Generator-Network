If you are feeling stressed, lonely or in pain, sometimes the only thing you crave is a cuddle.

So an Indiana mother-of-two has started a business to take advantage of the desire for a comforting touch - by charging clients for cuddling sessions.

Lisa Kelly from Carmel, Indiana, owns Indy Cuddles which offers 30 minutes worth of hugs for $35, $60 for an hour and $90 for 90 minutes.

She will visit the customer's home and lie in many different, relaxing positions in what she believes is a form of therapy - but critics have said it is one step away from prostitution and an embarrassment to her family. 

Give me a hug: Lisa Kelly from Carmel, Indiana, owns Indy Cuddles which offers 30 minutes worth of hugs for $35, $60 for an hour and $90 for 90 minutes worth of hugs

Comfort: She will visit the client's home and lie in many different, relaxing positions in what she believes is a form of therapy - but critics have said it is one step away from prostitution

However she insists that the encounters are not sexual and come with certain rules, which includes avoiding the 'bathing suit' area and touching that would be 'acceptable with a child'.

She told the Indianapolis Star: 'It's not sexual at all. It's something for people who feel alone or stressed out or in pain for whatever reason, lonely.' 

Kelly also ensures that both parties adopt cleanliness and adequate hygiene, including brushing teeth, showering and clean clothes. 

For safety, a third party is contacted before the meeting and told when the session is set to start and end while a waiver says she may carry a 'nonlethal weapon' on her person. 

She also meets the clients before their first encounter   

A description on her website reads: 'Often times, our lives are too busy and our love lives are off timing, but that doesn't mean we should deprive ourselves our human contact and touch. Touch has an amazing healing effect, regardless the cause. 

'Experiencing human touch brings us comfort in the form of physical, mental, and emotional well-being. It helps to assure us that everything IS going to be okay.'

Despite the criticism, research has proved that cuddles have a number of health benefits.  

Hugs prompt the body to produce ample amounts of the hormone oxytocin, which is released in response to physical touch and repairs muscle. 

Oxytocin is associated with maternal nurturing, social attachments, childbirth and sex is essential for healthy muscle maintenance and repair.

Boundaries: She insists that the encounters are not sexual and come with certain rules, which include no touching in the 'bathing suit' area

Precautions: For safety, a third party is contacted before the meeting and told when the session is set to start and end while a waiver says she may carry a 'nonlethal weapon' on her person

Research has found that unlike other treatments for muscle wasting, the hormone does not cause cancer and when injected, it could help old people recover from muscle injuries faster. 

Scientists from Emory University also found in 1999 that gentle touching reduces the physical signs of stress and tension. Depauw University's Touch and Emotion Lab has found that touching skin helps people develop closer bonds, particularly in infants

In 2012, Jackie Samuel established The Snuggery in Rochester, New York. She turned to getting paid.

She reportedly made $260 a day and cuddles with up to 30 men a week - including pensioners and war veterans. However at the time her college threatened to expel her and some called her a prostitute. 

In September, an app called Cuddlr was launched. Using the same system as the likes of Tinder and Grindr, it is a location-based meeting service that connects and matches people who want to hug strangers 

Expanding: Lisa and her her colleague, Derek Crager, are also looking for other 'huggers' to join their team
