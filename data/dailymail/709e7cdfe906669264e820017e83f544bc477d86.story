The pensions minister, Steve Webb, said new caps on the rates company management funds can charge customers will ensure 'value for money'

The pensions minister today said new regulations on the rate providers can charge customers will prevent people from being 'ripped off' by expensive fund management fees.

Steve Webb insisted the department was eager to ensure people were receiving 'value for money' with company pension funds by implementing a 0.75 per cent cap on management fees.

He however did not reveal whether the new regulations which are to come into place in April will apply to people already paying in to private schemes.  

Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today Programme, the minister said: 'A few percentage points here and there can add up to big money.

'We want to ensure people are getting value for money. It's not just about cost but making sure no one is ripped off.

'Equally however we don't want to drive charges so low that people can no longer get a quality product.'

When asked whether those already paying in to managed pension funds would be subject to the same caps, the minister merely said the department was 'looking at a number of options'.

'We're gathering a lot of data on old schemes and seeing what the impact would be there.'

Pensions expert Ros Altman said however customers had to pay more to receive better management on their investments.

'You can't expect people to manage funds for free.

'If we want innovation and more imaginative investment rather than relying on passive management, which effectively uses a computer to select the right stocks to invest in, we do need to allow some extra charges.

'Everything you do in pensions is risky whether it’s by a computer or in a fund manager. There are always going to be risks.'

Leading company Legal and General have said the proposed 0.75 per cent cap is too high and could lead to customers paying fund managers over £4billion too much

Under new Government proposals, pension management companies could be forced to limit fund fees to 0.75 per cent.

But, how much have those paying in already lost to hidden charges?

Figures published by the Department of Work and Pensions last month revealed that a person paying 0.5 per cent in annual management charges lost 13 per cent of their savings to company fees.

A customer who pays just one per cent lost almost a quarter of their savings, while someone paying one and a half per cent in annual management charges lost more than a third.

Ms Altman however added: 'We are missing a much bigger element though and that what happens on the way in when people buy annuities.

'As it stands there are no controls on how much you can be charged for buying a product, and as much as three and a half per cent of people's pensions are lost when buying annuities.

'It's huge.'

The pensions minister did not reveal whether caps on the rate of annuity charges would be introduced, but said the recently proposed plans were part of a necessary 'market shake up'.

Leading pensions provider Legal and General have hit out against the department's proposed cap rate, suggesting 0.75 per cent is too high and will lead to people pouring too much money into fund managers' pockets.

The company has estimated customers would pay over £4billion too much if a 0.75 cap is introduced, instead suggesting limits should be set at the lower end of the scale.

Today marks the end of a consultation period, after which the Government will decide which course of action to take.
