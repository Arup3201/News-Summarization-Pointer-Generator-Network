The former girlfriend of George Soros tearfully begged judges not to throw out her  $50 million lawsuit against the billionaire.

Brazilian soap star Adriana Ferreyr, 30, claims 83-year-old Soros for broke his promise to buy her a $1.9 million apartment in Manhattan, New York.

She has also alleged he intentionally inflicted emotional damage to her by slapping her during a fight and having security guards 'stalk' her. 

Soros's lawyer argued that Adriana Ferreyr exaggerated and mischaracterized what Soros did as their five year romance was cracking up in 2010

Yesterday, at the Appellate Division court in Manhattan, she said: 'I deserve to have my case be heard. I 
deserve to have a trial.

'I believe in America. I believe in justice. I 
deserve to have a life ... to defend my reputation.'

In court papers, Ferreyr claims Soros gave the Upper East Side apartment he promised her to another girlfriend, Tamiko Bolton, who married Soros last year.

A lower court ruled that Ferreyr could not sue to enforce the promise but her case could continue on the claim that Soros intentionally inflicted emotional distress.

Soros appealed that ruling.

His lawyer, Gary Stein, argued that Ferreyr exaggerated and mischaracterized what Soros did as their five year romance was cracking up in 2010.

For example, he said, Soros didn't try to hit her with a lamp but rather it crashed to the floor during altercation.

'There’s no question that Ms. Ferreyr was really distressed that Mr. Soros did not buy her an apartment,' Stein said.

The $50 million suit was launched in 2011 after Soros gifted the apartment to his now-wife Tamika Bolton, 42.

Papers filed by Singer say Ferreyr screamed that Soros was a 'f***ing a**hole,' before lunging at him 'suddenly and without warning,' the New York Daily News reported.

She struck the octogenarian on the head, knocking off the headphones he was wearing to amplify the audio before she was restrained by Singer, according to the papers.

'I let go of her arms. Ms. Ferreyr immediately swung at my face, knocking off my glasses. She then moved toward my glasses that had landed on the floor as if she were going to jump on them,' Singer alleges.

'I again grabbed her arms and moved her away from my glasses. After I let go of her arms, she resumed swinging at me and attempted to kick me.'

Another aide who stepped in to help, Jose Santos, received a slap across the face and a kick in the shins from Ferreyr for his efforts, claims Singer.
