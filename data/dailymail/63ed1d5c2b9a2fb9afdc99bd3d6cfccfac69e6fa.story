For some Republican politicians the real star of Tuesday evenings State of the Union address was not the president but Willie Robertson - star of the hit A&E reality series Duck Dynasty.

A whole stream of star-struck GOP house members, including one-time vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan, seemed to go out of their way to get Robertson, 41, and his wife Korie to pose for smiling selfies.

Sporting his trademark Stars and Stripes bandana and untucked white shirt, Robertson was in high demand the minute he arrived in the Capitol building - despite cutting an unusual figure on such a prestigious occasion.

As he was seated in the visitor's gallery of the chamber, House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan traveled up from the floor to meet him and get himself an all important selfie with Duck Commander CEO.

Even veteran Republican Senator John McCain waved up at him from the floor.

Asked how it felt to be one of the big attractions of the evening, Robertson told The Daily Caller: 'It was awesome.'

'I don’t know,” he went on. “I think it’s the beard.'

But it wasn't all Republicans who wanted a piece of Robertson.

The son of controversial star Phil Robertson was invited to the State of the Union by Rep. Vance McAllister from Louisiana, who won election with the reality TV family’s support.

Among those who posted pictures of themselves with the star were the junior United States Senator from Louisiana David Vitter, who admitted that 'My kids are impressed I get to see one person tonight, and it's not President Obama or Speaker Boehner,' - in reference to Willie Robertson.

Indiana Rep. Jackie Walorski also posted a picture of herself and Willie while North Dakota Rep. Kevin Cramer uploaded a picture of his wife Kris beaming alongside the Duck Dynasty star.

Star Struck: Senator David Vitter said that his children couldn't be more impressed if he met President Obama or Speaker John Boehner as he posted this picture of Willie Robertson to Twitter

Warm up: U.S. Representative for Georgia, Tom Graves said that meeting the Robertson's was the perfect way to start the evening before the president's State of the Union address

U.S. Representative for Alabama, Martha Roby also posted a picture as did U.S. Representative for Georgia, Tom Graves and Texas Rep. Joe Barton.

Willie 'Boss Hog' Robertson invitation was announced by Vance McAllister on Twitter before the State of the Union.

Indeed, Representative McAllister pointedly said in a statement that he looks forward to 'bringing some diversity to our nation's Capitol', with the invitation of the younger Robertson, despite the huge controversy his father created last year.

'I'm happy to announce that my friend, constituent & small business owner @williebosshog will be attending tonight's #SOTU as my guest,' McAllister tweeted - including the younger Robertson's Twitter handle and the "#SOTU" hashtag, or search term, for the State of the Union address.

Robertson's wife Korie, who also appears on the show, was given a guest ticket to the speech by South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, who tweeted a photo of himself with the couple. Graham, a Republican, is up for re-election this year.

Robertson, 41, is a son of 'Duck Dynasty' patriarch Phil Robertson, who was temporarily suspended from the hit show by cable television network A&E last month for making anti-gay remarks in a magazine interview. Other quotes in the interview were criticized as racist.

Phil Robertson's suspension sparked a national debate over tolerance and religion, with several Republican politicians and conservative figures coming to his defense.

The patriarch, who never apologized for his remarks, was reinstated after fans protested and big-name corporate sponsors stuck by the show.

Willie Robertson is the chief executive officer of Duck Commander, a family-run business that specializes in duck-hunting gear and whose family's life is the subject of "Duck Dynasty," which averages about 8 million viewers per episode. The show is in its fifth season.

CEO Robertson supported and endorsed McAllister in November during the Louisiana politician's successful campaign in a special election for a vacant congressional seat in the Pelican State's Fifth District.
