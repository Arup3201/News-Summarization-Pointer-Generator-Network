Nelson was painted by John Whichelo in September 1805 after the young artist visited him at his home

The last portrait made of Admiral Lord Nelson before he was killed in the Battle of Trafalgar is expected to fetch £30,000 at auction tomorrow.

Nelson was painted by John Whichelo in September 1805 after the young artist visited him at his estate in Merton, South London.

While at his home, Nelson began plans for the Battle of Trafalgar and also said his goodbyes to lover Lady Emma Hamilton.

He was killed in action a month later as he led the Royal Navy to victory against the French and Spanish.

But just a month later, he was killed in action has he led the British navy to their famous win over Napoleon's forces.

The profile portrait depicts a grey-haired Nelson in Vice-Admiral's undress uniform with the Star of the Order of the Bath pinned to his chest.

The order was presented to Nelson following the British victory at Cape St Vincent in 1797, and it was pinned to his uniform when he was shot dead at Trafalgar.

In 1838 Whichelo presented the portrait to Admiral William Parker after teaching his son to paint.It has remained in the Parker family ever since.

The portrait is expected to fetch upwards of £30,000 when it goes under the hammer.

Dr Gabriel Heaton, from auctioneers Sotheby's, said: 'This is a wonderful and poignant portrait of one of Britain's unambiguous heroes.

'It is all the more special because it was painted during a very short break in which Nelson returned home to his estate after chasing the Combined Fleet down to the West Indies.

'During his leave, a young painter called John Whichelo travelled to Nelson's house at Merton and painted him in pastel.

'Nelson would have undoubtedly had a say in how he was portrayed - the portrait is very similar to one by Simon de Koster, which was known to be Nelson's favourite.

'The portrait captures Nelson at an incredibly important moment in his life and in British history.

'There were many potraits of Nelson after his death, but this is the last one ever made in life.

'Nelson is a tremendously important figure, and one who a lot of people feel an emotional attachment to.

'He is very keenly collected and we expect there to be a lot of interest in this portrait.'

The auction will be held at Sotheby's in London on July 10.
