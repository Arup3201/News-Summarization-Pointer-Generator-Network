A one-year-old girl was rushed to hospital after pranksters set a fishing line across the toy aisle of a Walmart supermarket catching her in the neck. 

Patricia Keeth was shopping with her daughter Allison in the Walmart in Bristow, Oklahoma when she was bumped backwards. 

However, little Allison was caught by the fishing line across the neck and knocked to the ground.

Speaking to Fox 23, Mrs Keeth said: 'If it was me, I would be really upset because I mean, that’s a little girl. It could’ve actually slit her. You never know what could’ve happened.'

Little Allison's neck was cut by the sharp fishing line. 

Mrs Keeth said: 'Even if it was a prank that was supposed to be funny or bad, I mean it could really hurt somebody. And I would like to know who did this and I want them to see my daughter’s neck.' 

She said she believed her daughter would suffer lasting damage. 

Management at the store said they would check CCTV footage to determine whether they could identify

Mrs Keeth added that Walmart has launched its own investigation and will determine whether they are responsible for the incident. 

Mrs Keeth said if the supermarket admits blame they would pay for Allison's hospital bills.
