Former soldier and teacher Jason McDermott, 45, has been given a life-time classroom ban for a history of 'recurring violence' against his pupils

A soldier-turned-teacher has been given a life-time classroom ban for punching, jabbing and pulling the hair of his pupils in a history of 'recurring violence'.

Jason McDermott, 45, struck pupils
 in the stomach or chest on four separate occasions - one of which left a pupil off school sick for two days.

He also grabbed the hair of a student in another incident.

The 45-year-old, who worked at CTC Kingshurst Academy in Solihull, West Midlands, defended his behaviour as 'boisterous play'.

In his self-written profile on the school's website, it also boasts that he has 'the mentality of “What doesn’t kill you will only make you stronger” - well we live in hope!!'

But after the ban was imposed, students jumped to the teacher's defence, with some saying he was 'the best teacher they'd ever had'. 

Ex-pupil Paige 
Griffiths set up a Facebook page called 'Support for Jason 
McDermott', to show her backing to the teacher. It received more than 800 'likes' in just two hours.

Mr McDermott was given the ban after admitting carrying out 'inappropriate physical contact' with his pupils over a two-year period.

Mr McDermott, who served with the British Army for 14 years, admitted unacceptable professional conduct when his case appeared in front of the National Council of Teaching and Leadership disciplinary panel.

The hearing heard Mr McDermott, who 
was first employed by the school in 1999, taught a BTEC course for 
Uniformed Services at the school.

It involved preparing students for potential jobs with the public services, including the fire brigade and the army.

The panel heard the violent incidents happened between January 2011 and March 2013. Shortly afterwards, Mr McDermott was 
suspended by the school and subsequently resigned.

The first allegation came to light after he pulled the hair of a pupil in January 2011. The pupil's mother complained and her concerns were passed on to the local authority.

But Mr McDermott went on to punch or jab students on 'a number of occasions', including 
the four highlighted by the panel, the hearing was told. These incidents were reported to the Vice Principal of the school by another member of staff. 

The panel concluded there had been a 'pattern 
of him engaging in inappropriate physical contact with pupils'.

It said he was also guilty of bringing the profession into disrepute and had a 'deep-seated attitude that leads to harmful behaviour'. 

But the description of his behaviour was criticised by former students. On her Facebook campaign, Miss Griffiths 
wrote: 'Everyone who knows Jason knows he's the best teacher ever to 
have been at CTC. We love you Jason!'

The 18-year-old said the ex-soldier 
would sometimes prod students, 'jokingly punch them', and make them do 
army style push up drills if they misbehaved.

She
 said: 'We used to do banter. It was sort of like play fighting, it was 
joking around. It may have looked violent, but it wasn't like that.

'Everyone who has liked the Facebook page is in support of him. The decision to ban him is unfair.'

Mr McDermott, who taught at CTC Kingshurst Academy in Solihull, West Midlands, described his behaviour as 'boisterous play' but a disciplinary panel said he was guilty of a 'pattern' of 'inappropriate physical contact'

The teenager hopes her group might help Mr McDermott if he decided to appeal the ban in the future.

She added: 'If he does appeal it, then all of us showing our support could help him out.'

Former
 pupils Keir Herbet said: 'I didn't always see eye to eye with him, but 
he was a very, very good teacher. He would never hurt anyone on purpose.
 It was never malicious, it was always banter.

'It's been taken out of context. He could be physical but in a joking manner. He was very respectful. He is a good man.'

McDermott,
 who was not present or represented at the hearing, said in a statement 
that physicality between staff and students had always been a part of 
the relationship on the course.

He said this had included ‘boisterous play between students and himself’, which involved him being 'on the end of many dead leg/arms or at the 
bottom of a pile on'.

But in a decision taken on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, Mr McDermott will now be banned from teaching in schools, sixth form colleges, relevant youth accommodation or children’s homes for life.

He has a right of appeal to the High Court within 28 days.

'We used to do banter. It was sort of 
like play fighting, it was joking around. It may have looked violent, 
but it wasn't like that'

NCTL official Paul Heathcote concluded: 'Mr
 McDermott has engaged in a pattern of inappropriate physical contact 
with pupils over a period of two years.

'The
 panel have decided that the public interest considerations outweigh the
 interests of Mr McDermott, particularly as his behaviour involved 
recurring violence against students of a potentially criminal nature.

'Mr McDermott accepts that what he did was wrong and that he regrets his actions.'

According to his profile on the school's website, Mr McDermott served with the army all over the world 'in many different theatres of operation commanding, training and developing soldiers in the Infantry'.

For the last nine years of service, he worked in the gym as a Physical and Adventurous Training Instructor, training new recruits at the Army Training Regiments.

Mr McDermott describes how he also had the opportunity to work with the Metropolitan Police in Hendon developing its programmes of unarmed defensive training.

He also worked with the Home Office to design and implement a new 'prisoner restraining methodology', as well as fitness training and assessment programmes for the London Fire Brigade.

The hearing heard Mr McDermott was considered to be a person of good character with no criminal or disciplinary sanctions before the first of the allegations.
