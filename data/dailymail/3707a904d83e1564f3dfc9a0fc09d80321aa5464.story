Most football fans dream of scoring the winning goal in a stadium packed full of thousands of cheering fans and now they can – in a miniature stadium in their garden, at least.

The Kansas City-based company that built the London 2012 Olympic Stadium is offering to make miniature fully-functional sports stadiums that can mimic any major sport stadium in the world.

The personalised ‘multisport’ stadium can seat up to 100 spectators and features wraparound video screens that can display an illusionary backdrop of choice – including cheering supporters – to make wealthy sports fans feel like they are playing in a professional stadium.

However, such technology comes at a cost and a bespoke stadium will cost around $30million (£18.3million).

Populous, the architects firm that built the London 2012 stadium, Wembley and the new Yankee stadium said the playing field can be up to 50-yards-long and will be surrounded by 20-foot LED screens, able to beam images of an array of famous stadiums to suit the sport being played.

Ryan Sickman, an engineer and associate principal at Populous, said players and spectators will feel 'enclosed' in the environment, meaning a fan could play an FA Cup final at Wembley or make a touchdown at the home of the Dallas Cowboys.

Amazingly, the pitch will be able to transform between different types of sports field markings at a flick of a switch.

Fibre-optic lighting can be embedded in the ‘FieldTurf’ artificial turf system to transform the playing field from a rugby pitch to a baseball diamond instantly.

A professional-grade sound system can channel the sounds of a chanting football ground, the polite clapping from a cricket match or even allow someone to commentate on the game.

Ryan Sickman, an engineer and associate principal at Populous, said: ‘We're not creating a stadium for thousands of people - this is a custom premium environment for a select number of people.

‘Wind, snow, and rain machines add even more authenticity to the playing and viewing experience and we can even design the stadium with a retractable roof so weather is not a concern.

‘Locker rooms with showers can also can be included - the possibilities are endless.’
