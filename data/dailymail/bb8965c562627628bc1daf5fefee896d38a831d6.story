By car, by train, by foot, thousands are descending on Kiev this week to mark a special anniversary.

But no ordinary train will do for Ukraine's religious leaders as they prepare to celebrate the 1,025th anniversary of the 'baptism of Kievan Rus' - the medieval kingdom that first witnessed the conversion of the region's pagans to Christianity.

A special armoured 'temple wagon' - kitted out with church fixtures, including a belfry and choir - has been laid on to transport Russian president Vladimir Putin, Russian Orthodox Church leader Patriarch Kirill and other dignitaries to mark the religious milestone.

Modern Kiev is the birthplace of Christianity in what is now Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.

Back
in 988, when the region was called Kievan Rus, Prince Vladimir took a group of pagans into the Dnepr River in Ukraine and baptised them 
to become Orthodox Christians.

The process of conversion to Christianity took several centuries but modern Kiev is 
still considered to be the cradle of Orthodox Christianity in this part 
of Europe.Â 

The customised five-carriage train contains a vestry in place of a conductor's compartment, an altar, lectern - and even a 50-litre container for run-off holy water.

It will also transport the X-shaped Cross of St Andrew the Apostle, which is on loan from its home cathedral in Patras, Greece.

'Prayer services will be held all the way down to Kiev,' a church spokesman told Ukrainian daily Segodnya.

Meanwhile, a railway source said the train is 'like a hotel on wheels' - albeit one decorated with gold leaf.

Putin, along with top clerics from the 15 national Eastern Orthodox churches, are due to arrive in the Ukrainian capital tomorrow.

Ahead of the anniversary, Putin confessed in a new documentary that he was secretly baptised as a child in Soviet Leningrad. He is seen here inspecting a military exercise last week

Around 6,000 policemen will be on duty to maintain order during the celebrations,  according to the BBC.

Kievan Rus laid the Orthodox foundation for modern-day Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine.
