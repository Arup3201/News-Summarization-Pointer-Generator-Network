Had enough: Film star Gerard Depardieu was among a clutch of high-profile French millionaires who have quit France over the tax on the super rich. He is pictured here holding his new Russian passport in January

France's repressive tax regime has sent entrepreneurs fleeing abroad and lost the country up to a million jobs, a damning new report has revealed.

Tax hikes and employment regulations imposed by left and right wing governments over 20 years meant there were now 60,000 French businessmen abroad employing around 16 people each.

The figures were released amid a flood of wealthy French quitting France this year to avoid a looming socialist tax of 75 per cent on all earnings over one million euros - about Â£850,000.

Film star Gerard Depardieu, the 
Mulliez family who own the Auchan supermarket chain, electronic music 
icon Jean-Michel Jarre and France's richest man Bernard Arnault have all
 quit France in the past six months.

Now
 research by the think-tank Concorde has found that three percent of the
 two million French living abroad now own companies and if they had not 
left there would one million more people in work in France.

And their report published in French daily Le Figaro describes even that figure as a 'conservative estimate'.

It
 added that the number of French going into tax exile had accelerated 
dramatically in the past year, and sales of properties worth more than 
one million pounds had also shot up.

France's economy minister Pierre Moscovici has reacted angrily to claims rich French are leaving the country, telling a conference of business leaders in Paris: 'I am troubled to read in the papers that the exile has begun, and that companies are fleeing.

'I also lament attacks on the government's economic policies that are in vogue in France and abroad. Le French-bashing is terrible.'

His comments also came after Laurence 
Parisot - head of MEDEF, the French equivalent of the UK's Confederation
 of British Industry - warned that left-wing economic policies risked 
turning France into 'the poor man of Europe'.

She said: 'Large foreign investors are shunning France altogether. It's becoming really dramatic.

'Ten years ago, Germany was the poor man of Europe and if we don't act now, that title will soon be ours.'

Paris estate agents said in September that France's luxury property market had hit a 'selling panic' as the super-rich rushed to flee new higher taxes.

Estate agent Daniel Feau said: 'It's 
nearly a general panic. Some 400 to 500 residences worth more than one 
million euros have come onto the Paris market since May.'

And
 British estate agent Sotherby's said its French offices sold more than 
100 properties over 1.7 million euros between April and June this year -
 a marked increase on the same period in 2011.

Another
 report earlier this year by British estate agent Knight Frank said the 
tax plans had sent French interest in luxury London homes rocketing.

Inquiries
 from wealthy French for London homes worth more than five million 
pounds soared by 30 per cent in the first three months of this year, the
 statistcs showed.

Anger: David Cameron angered the French in June when he told the B20 business summit Britain would 'roll out the red carpet and welcome more French businesses' if the French government went ahead with the tax

Prime minister David Cameron angered the French in June when he told the B20 business summit in Mexico: 'If the French go ahead with a 75 per cent top rate of tax we will roll out the red carpet and welcome more French businesses to Britain.

'And they can pay tax in Britain and pay for our health service and schools and everything else.'

The comments left one French politician so offended he suggested Mr Cameron must have been 'drunk' when he made them.

Gallic MP Claude Bartolone, a staunch ally of President Hollande, said: 'I hope that it was an after-dinner remark and that he didn't have all his wits about him when he said these things.'

France's European Affairs Minister Bernard Cazeneuve insisted there was no 'exodus', adding: 'What I can answer to this statement from the British prime minister is that French bosses are patriots.'

'There is a range of measures we will take in favour of business, measures that will support investment and encourage business to stay in France.'
