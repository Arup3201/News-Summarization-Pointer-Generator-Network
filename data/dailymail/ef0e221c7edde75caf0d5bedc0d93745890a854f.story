A three-year-old boy has made a remarkable recovery after doctors feared he had been blinded by a Chinese lantern.

Cael Jones couldn’t open his eyes for two weeks after molten wax from the fire lantern which had been released into the sky fell and landed on his face.

His skin instantly turned black and 
began to peel, blistering his eyes shut meaning doctors were unable to 
tell whether his eyes had been damaged

Recovered: Emma Foulkes with her son Cael, who suffered terrible facial burns a year ago from a Chinese lantern burner

But luckily, Cael’s eyesight was found to be unaffected by the incident and a year on from the accident, the majority of the youngster's burns injuries have healed.

Emma Foulkes, 24, of Wrexham, North Wales said: 'Given Cael’s injuiries of last year it’s a 
miracle that he’s recovered so well over the past year.

'At first he thought the burn 
injuries were like a mask and he wouldn’t go out of the house but he’s 
been a real fighter and his progress has been amazing - although there 
are still some visibly signs of scarring.'

Injury: Cael couldn't see for two weeks and doctors feared he had lost his sight

Now Ms Foulkes mother is warning people not to use Chinese lanterns in this year’s New Year celebrations for fear another child maybe hurt.

'Right now I would back anything that can be done to help improve the situation as regards Chinese lanterns.

'They are too dangerous and something definitely needs to be done about them. We’ll be avoiding any firework parties at New Year. Seeing or hearing them does bring bring back a bit what happened and we don’t want to go through it again.'

The accident happened on Bonfire Night last year during a family get together. Emma added: 'We’d usually have Chinese lanterns and kids loved watching them float into the sky, so when it came to bonfire night, in 2010, we got some and told the children they could make a secret wish as they set them free.

'Then it was time for the big ending, the lanterns, I think Cael’s was last to go. I helped him up onto his uncle’s shoulders and watched as my cousin helped Cael to gently push off his lantern, and laughed as he sat face towards the sky, mesmerised.

'The lantern got to about the height of the roof, when the burner bit fell and landed on Cael’s face.

'He couldn’t open his eyes and his skin turned black and began to peel away, everyone was screaming.

'We were at the hospital for over three hours, they tried to check if his eye sight was okay but his skin had scabbed over instantly, shutting his eyes.

'The doctors gave him morphine and I spoke to him constantly so he could hear my voice, but refused to leave him over night because I didn’t want him to be frightened.

'For the next nine days he lived in darkness, saying ‘fire on my face’ and would ask me if he could take the ‘mask’ off yet, he couldn’t understand why his eyes wouldn’t open.'

The night it happened: This collect shows the lanterns being lit and released in a back garden, shortly before one injured Cael

The full-time mother added: 'He was really frustrated because he couldn’t do anything himself. He was a baby again, I had to bathe him, feed him and help him walk around.

'When his left eye first opened, I was so relieved he could see but it was another week before I found out about his right.

'We were so happy; we didn’t dare to talk about what could have happened.'

North Wales Assembly Member Antoinette Sandbach has since submitted a legislative bid to restrict the use of Chinese lanterns. Ms Sandbach said: 'No one wants to be a killjoy, but releasing these lanterns puts other people, farm animals and property at risk.

'While the lanterns are airborne, they can be mistaken for marine distress flares and have the potential to damage aircraft. The burning fuel can set alight to residential and business premises, and farmland is also at risk in dry weather.

'They also pose an unacceptable threat.'
