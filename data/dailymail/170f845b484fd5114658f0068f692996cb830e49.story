Schalke midfielder Julian Draxler will not be going anywhere during the January transfer window, according to the club's chairman Clemens Tonnies.

With Schalke in talks with Manchester City over a possible deal for defender Matija Nastasic, recent reports have hinted Draxler could be included in the move.

However, club chairman Tonnies insists the 21-year-old - who has not played since October having suffered a serious thigh injury - is already at the best club to aid his football development.

Speaking to Bild, Tonnies said: 'We have absolutely no thoughts about him leaving on short notice, Schalke is the place where he can develop best and I told him that in person.

'My opinion is also, that Julian has developed greatly, especially regarding his personality.

'He had a setback with his injury and, as with every big player at a young age, he had a weaker period. But Julian will have a fantastic career.'
