Rangers striker Kenny Miller has warned runaway Scottish Championship leaders Hearts to beware a new rival in the title race: complacency.

The Tynecastle side are currently unbeaten after nine matches and sit nine points ahead of second place Rangers, who play Raith Rovers at Ibrox on Saturday.

But veteran striker Miller, who has been over the course before in title races with Rangers and Celtic, believes that getting to the top of the table is far easier than dealing with the pressure of turning being so far out in front to getting over the winning line.

‘I don’t know any of the Hearts lads really so I don’t know their attitude or mentality but if you are ahead by nine points, complacency can maybe creep in,’ said Miller.

‘It could be “we could afford to draw here” or “we can afford to lose, we are still (top)” but that’s a dangerous way of thinking.

‘Seeing out a title race is the hardest thing in the world to do. You can be miles and miles ahead but to get that last win and get across the line is a difficult thing to do. The pressure does mount.

‘We have got the experience in our dressing room of having to go through it on the final day or of having to win an Old Firm game to claw back into the title race.

‘Of course I’d rather be 15 points in front than behind and chasing but we are currently nine points back and it doesn’t sit right with us. We are looking to put that right.

‘But the way Hearts are going it looks like the title race will go down to the wire.’

Miller insisted it is not beyond the realms of possibility that Hearts can complete a league season without defeat. But he warned Robbie Neilson’s men the longer they remain unbeaten the more their Championship rivals will now be gunning to take them down.

He said: ‘They are nine games in, 25 per cent of the way there, so I wouldn’t say it is unrealistic. But we will have a big say in that, as will the other teams.

‘The longer that run goes on, the more other teams are motivated to put an end to that run. They might see teams raising their game more against them, like teams have done against us this season.

‘There are a lot of things that come into it when you are trying to win a title. Pressure and experience might start telling and injuries and suspensions creep in.

‘There’s a million and one things can turn a title challenge on its head but we have got to focus on ourselves. We know that if we play the way we can play, we have got 28 games to go, and if we do what we can do then we will win the league. If we don’t then it will be tough.’

It was a point taken up by Hearts boss Neilson who insisted Hearts have become a huge scalp for the opposition, with their rivals desperate to end the Gorgie outfit’s unbeaten start to the campaign.

Part-time Dumbarton, who they face on Saturday, have come the closest following September’s goal-less draw.

And Neilson said: ‘Dumbarton are very dangerous and every team wants to be the first team that beats us now.

‘It was the same at Alloa last week, they wanted to be the first team to beat us.

‘They played very well and made it difficult but we managed to grind it out, it will be the same on Saturday.

‘It’s difficult for teams at the top of the league when sides come and are happy with a 0-0, it’s up to us to break them down and I would be doing exactly the same if I was in Ian Murray’s position. They’ll try and kill the game and slow it down, then maybe nick it.

Hearts players celebrate during their unbeaten start to the season, but Miller has warned of complacency 

‘But you can sense that determination from my boys to keep this run going. There is a determination in the squad to try and win the league, that’s what we want to do.

“There is a confidence there that is growing and growing and we’ll continue to nurture it, but also be ready for the time when we do lose a game.’

Kenny Miller was speaking to promote Armed Forces Day. Over 200 service personnel and veterans will be at Ibrox today as Rangers honour the armed forces.
