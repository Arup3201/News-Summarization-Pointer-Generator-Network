In a season when Manchester United’s aspirations have been peeled away like layers of an onion, the only goal left is qualification for the Champions League. It is enough to make even the steadfast shed a tear.

Thrashed in the Capital One Cup by League One MK Dons and dumped out of the FA Cup by one of their own, United were never even in the Premier League title race.

Entry back into Europe’s elite competition would represent a positive campaign however. The minimal requirement, undoubtedly, but a mark of improvement nonetheless. Something to look forward to.

Manchester United have not beaten a team in the top half of the Premier League since Liverpool in December

Failure to finish in the top four would be pretty disastrous though. Without the extra commitment of a European campaign and having held a healthy lead in this run at one stage, falling late would ask serious questions of Louis van Gaal.

It would probably mean entry into the Europa League instead – a nightmare scenario adding games in a competition United would rather avoid entirely. The continent’s purgatory.

United face a difficult run-in, with 10 games to define their season. Four of their next five matches are against the top six but Van Gaal’s side have not beaten a team currently in the top half of the table since December. Here,Sportsmail assesses their chances.

Man United vs Tottenham (March 15)

Reverse fixture: 0-0

A struggle for life, is how Van Gaal termed the second half of the sides’ dour draw at White Hart Lane on December 28. A repeat would be intolerable not only to watching fans but in the table. United must win, and beware Harry Kane.

The 21-year-old striker already has 26 goals to his name this season - more than the supposedly stellar line-up of Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao have managed for United combined.

Besides, Mauricio Pochettino's men have Champions League ambitions of their own, and will be desperate for a victory over one of their chief rivals for the top four.  

Prediction: 2-1 United

Manchester United train ahead of their crunch Premier League clash against Tottenham on Sunday

Wayne Rooney, Juan Mata and Radamel Falcao are all smiles despite their side's recent struggles

Football data analysts BSports believe a Manchester United home win is easily the most likely outcome

March 15: Tottenham (home)

March 22: Liverpool (away)

April 4: Aston Villa (home)

April 12: Man City (home)

April 18: Chelsea (away)

April 26: Everton (away)

May 2: West Brom (home)

May 9: Crystal Palace (away)

May 16: Arsenal (home)

May 24: Hull (away)

Liverpool vs Man United (March 22)

Reverse fixture: 3-0 United

The match at Old Trafford sparked Liverpool’s remarkable resurgence into the Champions League hunt. This game could prove the deciding factor. Brendan Rodgers has his side buoyant and Anfield will be bouncing. Van Gaal should douse the flames with his selection.

But, with Philippe Coutinho rampant, Raheem Sterling offering pace and dynamism simply not seen in United's team and Daniel Sturridge now back in action after injury,the Dutchman will need a tactical masterstroke to pull off victory.

This is arguably the fiercest rivalry in the land as England's two most successful clubs go head-to-head. Anfield will be rocking with the added incentive that Van Gaal's head could be on the block if he fails to finish in the top four. 

Prediction: 1-1

Man United vs Aston Villa (April 4)

Reverse fixture: 1-1

Tim Sherwood led Spurs to victory in his previous visit to Old Trafford as a manager, and Villa are showing signs of vibrancy under his charge. They need points for survival and will fight all the way for it. 

Surely United will have too much quality though. Could arguably be the easiest fixture in United's run-in. But, as we've seen these last two seasons, anything is possible in the post-Fergie era.

Prediction: 2-0 United

Man United vs Man City (April 12)

Reverse fixture: 1-0 City

Sergio Aguero got the decisive goal at the Etihad on an afternoon Chris Smalling lost his head and City were denied three clear penalties. Manuel Pellegrini’s team have not often been at their best since, but their firepower can be awesome when focused on the right target. Such as their biggest rivals.

This will be a third Manchester derby at Old Trafford at this stage in three consecutive seasons. City have won the past two. 6-1, anyone?

United have rarely got near their noisy neighbours in recent years. And City's focus could be entirely focused on overhauling Chelsea's Premier League lead after their likely Champions League elimination in Barcelona. But Old Trafford will not stand for their men surrendering as meekly as during last season's grim 3-0 defeat.

Prediction: 1-1

Sergio Aguero is likely to cause the United defence problems in next month's Manchester derby

Chelsea vs Man United (April 18)

Reverse fixture: 1-1

Robin van Persie’s late equalising goal got Old Trafford to its feet and hoping a turning point had been found. It proved to be a false dawn and Chelsea have eased away at the top. Out of Europe, Jose Mourinho’s side are unlikely to lose focus as their hunt for the title reaches its closing moments.

Men like John Terry, Nemanja Matic and Diego Costa will surely not let that happen, and the Blues' mixture of power, pace and potency should see them too good for United.

PSG did, however, expose chinks in Chelsea's armour. Whether Angel Di Maria, Ashley Young et al are strong enough to pierce those gaps is another matter,

Prediction 2-1 Chelsea

Eden Hazard has been Chelsea's stand out player this season as they bid to recapture the title

Everton vs Man United (April 26)

Reverse fixture: 2-1 United

Radamel Falcao appeared like a tiger to pounce for the winning goal at Old Trafford but the once-feared predator has experienced the wilderness since. Defeat at Goodison Park did for David Moyes last season although the ground does hold happier memories for United.

But Everton are in a scrap themselves. Defeat this weekend and a victory for QPR or Burnley could leave Roberto Martinez's men just three points off the dreaded drop zone. Surely that would be the wake-up call Everton need to spark their season into life at long last. 

Prediction: 1-1

Romelu Lukaku could cause United problems if he can carry his European form into the Premier League

Man United vs West Brom (May 2)

Reverse fixture: 2-2

Twice United came from behind to salvage a point at the Hawthorns, with Daley Blind’s measured effort the point-clincher. West Brom are a tougher nut to crack these days under Tony Pulis but the need for victory will weigh heavy on the hosts. 

The Baggies were also one of the teams to spring a shock at Old Trafford last season, when Saido Berahino and Morgan Amalfitano stunned David Moyes. 

Expect Berahino to score at Old Trafford again, but United to have the edge with more to play for than their visitors.

Prediction: 2-1 United

Tony Pulis has transformed West Brom's fortunes and his side will be a stern test for United in May

Crystal Palace vs Man United (May 9)

Reverse fixture: 1-0 United

Juan Mata, remember him? The Spaniard popped up for the winner in the season’s earlier game, an example of United at their most stubborn - performing poorly but still grinding out a win. Another illustration at Selhurst Park would do just fine.

But that is easier said than done, with Alan Pardew having galvanised Palace since his return to Selhurst Park.

Silencing the Eagles' ferocious home support in a big game towards the end of the season is no easy task - just ask Liverpool. But surely Van Gaal can squeeze a win here.

Prediction: 1-0 United

Juan Mata scored the only goal of the game when United hosted Crystal Palace earlier in the season

Man United vs Arsenal (May 16)

Reverse fixture: 2-1 United

A smash and grab to make John Dillinger blush, United stole three points from the Emirates in a game they ought to have lost. Angel Di Maria and Wayne Rooney showed a fleeting impression of understanding too.

Arsenal have since shown that they know how to win at Old Trafford, thanks to the Danny Welbeck-inspired win in the FA Cup on Monday in which United struggled to get break down their opponents and were outfought as well as out-thought.

But Monday's FA Cup defeat has pained United. That Welbeck was the man to deliver the knockout blow stings even more. Expect revenge.

Prediction: 2-1 United

Danny Welbeck scored the winner as Arsenal dumped United out of the FA Cup earlier this week

Hull vs Man United (May 24)

Reverse fixture: 3-0 United

The last time United visited the KC Stadium on the final day Sir Alex Ferguson fielded an inexperienced side having wrapped up the title and with a Champions League final against Barcelona on the horizon. How times have changed. 

Steve Bruce’s side could be safe by then and less motivated. But if they're not, this fixture becomes loaded full of danger - for both sides.

You would back the United of old to win this encounter every time, but can you say the same about Van Gaal's version?

Prediction: 1-0 United

Total predicted points: 74.

United won the title with just one point more in 1996/97 but the parameters have shifted since then. Last year under Moyes they finished seventh on 64 points, while Arsenal came fourth on 79. Close call on whether 74 would be enough this time.
