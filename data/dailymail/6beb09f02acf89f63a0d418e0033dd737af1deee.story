This is the first picture of highly-respected university professor Michael Porter, who died after he was trampled by a herd of around 30 cows.

Mr Porter, 66, was crushed when the animals stampeded as he crossed a farmer's field in Turleigh, Wiltshire, while out walking with his brother and their two dogs.

His brother John, 72, was left fighting for his life with a collapsed lung and broken ribs after Monday's incident. John's wife Mary, 77, witnessed the terrifying charge but escaped unharmed.

Remarkably, it is the fourth cow attack in the village in five years.

Tragic: Michael Porter died and his brother was seriously injured after they were trampled by a herd of around 30 cows while walking their two dogs through a field

Mr Porter, a recently retired senior lecturer at the Centre for Population Health Sciences at Edinburgh University, suffered chest injuries on his son Nick's 31st birthday.

Nick and brother Robert, 28, were last night comforting mother Adrienne Sillar, at their home in Edinburgh.

Two air ambulances and a land vehicle attended the incident at around 12.45pm. Michael was pronounced dead at the scene, but John was airlifted to Frenchay Hospital.

A spokeswoman for the South Western Ambulance Service said: 'One male patient suffered chest injuries and was declared deceased at the scene.

'The second male's injuries were thought to be non-life threatening but he deteriorated after complaining of pain on his left side.

'Two air ambulances and a land vehicle attended the incident.'

Location: Mr Porter suffered serious chest injuries and died at the scene in Turleigh, Wiltshire, while his brother was airlifted to Bristol's Frenchay Hospital. Pictured are cows in a field near where the incident happened

The field is a popular cut through for
walkers, leading ramblers from the picturesque village of Turleigh to 
the Kennett and Avon canal in Bradford-on-Avon, and has a public 
footpath running through it.

The cows have been removed from the scene and taken to a nearby field.

Alison
Bossom, 59, has lived near the family in Monkton Combe, Somerset, for 
27 years and described them as 'good Christian people'.

She revealed John Porter, who has a 
grown up son and daughter, had worked in agriculture while his wife 
Mary, 77, worked in education before the pair retired.

Mrs Bossom added: 'It really has 
surprised me and I have only just found out who was involved. They are 
good Christian people and very neighbourly - always have been.

'It
is an awful shock to find out this has happened to someone you know, 
especially John as he certainly knew his way around a farm.

'I
believe he is retired now, but he worked in something to do with 
agriculture. I did not know his brother though. I feel terrible for 
them, especially Mary.'

Locals said the cows who trampled the 
tragic 66-year-old to death belonged to farmer Brian Godwin, who either 
rents or owns the land where the tragedy unfolded.

It is understood he lives two miles from the field at a farm in Winsley Hill, Bath.

A woman at the farm house on Tuesday 
said nobody wanted to comment. It is the fourth time cows in the fields 
near Turleigh have injured walkers.

In 2011 a metal engineer was left with
two broken vertebrae in his neck and a severe leg injury after he was 
charged by a cow on a Turleigh field.

David Billington was walking home from
The Cross Guns pub in October 2011 when he was knocked to the ground by
a cow and trampled on.

He suffered injuries to the head, neck and legs which left him unconscious in the field for more than an hour-and-a-half.

Due to the nature of his neck injuries
Mr Billington had to wear a Halo Brace for 12 weeks and needed a skin 
graft on his left calf.

'The cows are getting more and more dangerous, and I said it was only a matter of time before someone was killed'

- Simon Dark

At the time of the incident his 
sister, Cathy Hough said: 'This is a route David takes frequently and 
he'd never thought anything like this would happen.

'He has said to me he'd like to warn 
people who take that commuter path to be fully aware of the dangers and 
how unpredictable cows can be.

'We wouldn't like to see this happen to anyone else and there needs to be extra safety measures put in place.'

Simon Dark, who was trampled by cows 
while walking his dog on a public footpath near the field in 2008, said 
there was a need for action to be taken.

He said: 'I was walking my dog on a 
public footpath and the cows circled us. I picked her up and pushed my 
way through, but when I put her down again they charged at me, knocking 
me over and trampling me.

'I only survived because a man came out of a cottage nearby to help. He was also knocked over, and suffered a collapsed lung.

'The cows are getting more and more dangerous, and I said it was only a matter of time before someone was killed.

'Something needs to be done about them. It was a terrifying experience and I don't go near any fields with cows now.'

Retired Paul Harris, a local resident who walks his dogs through the fields joined the call for action.

He said: 'It really is concerning. It 
makes me wonder if there is a rogue cow, because I believe there wasn't 
even any calves in the field.

'You would think once would be enough 
for the farmers to maybe do something to try and protect people, but 
then again I do understand you can't protect every walker and if you 
start putting up fences and things they could not get their vehicles 
through.'

Geraldine Ng, who owns stables which overlook the scene, said the whole village was in shock.

She said: 'Everyone is incredibly depressed really, it is such a shock to happen so close.

'I can only imagine that maybe they did not know there were cows in there, because sometimes there is not.

'It is such a beautiful and popular walk down to the pub - it's awful what has happened.'

A spokesperson for the Health and Safety Executive said they will be investigating.
