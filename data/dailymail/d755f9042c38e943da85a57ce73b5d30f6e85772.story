Lewis Hamilton has admitted that he would have been 'lost' had he failed to make the grade in Formula One.

The Briton was recently named the world's most marketable athlete, beating sprint sensation Usain Bolt and footballing superstars Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar to the title, with an estimated worth of £68million.

It is far removed from Hamilton's humble beginnings in a one-bed flat in Stevenage as his father Anthony held down three jobs in order for them to go racing.

'I don't know,' said Hamilton when asked what he'd be doing if he hadn't fulfilled his dream of becoming a racing driver. 

'I actually wrote a song about it. I could have been anywhere. I think about it today, and I am sure I would have been lost.'

Hamilton trails Nico Rosberg by 29 points in the race for the championship after finishing second to his Mercedes team-mate in Austria eight days ago. 

But the former McLaren driver was in a reflective mood as he spoke ahead of this week's British Grand Prix; a race he has failed to win since his remarkable drive in appalling conditions back in 2008. 

'Karting was a catalyst for lots of different things,' Hamilton added. 'My dad was working for British Rail and when we started karting he was doing IT. He would pull 24-hour shifts, just to keep us racing.

'My dad said in the first year of racing we spent £20,000. We had just moved out of the one-bedroom flat in Stevenage.

'He put in my step mum’s life savings, his life savings and remortgaged the house, just for that year. It was a huge gamble and a huge commitment, and a lot of people do that and don’t get the end result.'

With 35 pole positions, 26 race wins, and his championship triumph in 2008, Hamilton can lay claim to being one of Britain's most successful ever drivers. 

But how would he cope if he fails to claim his second title this year given the advantage that Mercedes have over their rivals?

'That’s not really something I want to think about or put out there,' he said. 'Why would I even consider it? It’s all about positive energy.

'You’ve got to have in your mind I’m going to win. I’m going to do everything that I can. I’m going to get up and I’m going to train and get to that race next week and be P1, P1, P1. You can’t ever think what if this or that, because you’ll never get anywhere.'

Thinking: Hamilton says he will have plenty of 'positive energy' when he takes to the track next
