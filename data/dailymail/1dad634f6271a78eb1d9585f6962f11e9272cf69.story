Prince Philip: The Duke of Edinburgh attended a garden party at Buckingham Palace yesterday

Prince Philip was admitted to hospital last night for an operation after suffering abdominal pain.

Tests have revealed the 91-year-old requires exploratory surgery under general anaesthetic.

Despite the health fears, he carried out seven public engagements this week including a naval visit, two dinners and Tuesday’s high-profile service to mark the 60th anniversary of the Queen’s coronation.

Philip even attended yesterday’s garden party for 8,000 at Buckingham Palace and spent the afternoon cracking jokes with guests.

He left the event at around 5.30pm, changed out of his morning suit and was driven to the London Clinic, a private hospital on Harley Street.

He is expected to have surgery today and is likely to be in hospital for up to two weeks. His 92nd birthday is on Monday.

It came as The Queen visited Broadcasting House today without her husband to officially open it after £1billion of work was carried out.

Prime Minister David Cameron said Prince Philip was held in the 'highest esteem' and said the whole of Britain would be 'wishing him well'.

The prince has cancelled two engagements over the past week – a lecture at Windsor Castle and a reception at Buckingham Palace – but aides said this was not due to his abdominal pain.

A royal source told the Mail: ‘The Duke underwent abdominal tests last week and was told a few days ago that he needed to have an exploratory operation.

‘He has been feeling under the weather in recent days but that is because he had lost his voice. The two are quite unconnected.

‘He was admitted to hospital by 
arrangement and left quite calmly – and without any panic – after today’s garden party, where he was on top form.’

The situation prompts further questions about the Duke of Edinburgh’s workload and that of the Queen.

A few weeks ago, Buckingham Palace 
announced the pair would be scaling back on their long-haul foreign 
travel, leaving it largely to younger royals.

The Mail also revealed that high-level
 talks had been taking place between Buckingham Palace, Clarence House 
and Downing Street for Prince Charles to take an even more prominent 
role.

It will also put pressure on the Duke 
and Duchess of Cambridge – who are expecting their first baby – to 
become full-time working royals.

Prince William is due to leave his

within weeks to announce what he intends to do next.

He had been 
expected to take up a further military post that would give him more 
opportunity to undertake royal engagements.

However pressure is now sure
 to mount on him to leave the forces completely and take the strain off 
his elderly grandparents.

The Duke’s admittance to the clinic 
comes almost a year to the day that he was hospitalised with a serious 
bladder infection during the diamond jubilee celebrations.

At yesterday’s garden party, the Queen
 and Prince Philip appeared together on the steps of the palace at 4pm, 
when the national anthem was played.

Despite the fierce sun, with 
temperatures of around 22C (72F), the Duke appeared relaxed and happily 
chatted to guests as he walked around the garden.

Lord Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire Sir
 John Peace was introduced to the Queen and the duke as they made their 
way through the gardens. He said: ‘It was wonderful to see the Duke of 
Edinburgh with her.’

Sir John said the prince had been ‘telling jokes’ –
 but would not divulge what they were about.

With a two week stay, it's likely the Duke Of Edinburgh will undergo a series of tests.

GP Dr Arun Ghosh told MailOnline that an exploratory operation of the abdomen would usually suggest a laparoscopy - keyhole surgery to access and examine the inside of the abdomen and pelvis. 

This provides a much more detailed view of what is going on inside the body than techniques such as ultrasound.

A laparoscopy is not used to diagnose cancer. The procedure is often used to investigate what appears to be an obstruction, most commonly a twisted bowel, where the natural shape of the intestines has changed or a section of the intestines has overlapped. It is a condition more common with age.

General aesthetics can cause serious side-effects and the risks are far higher in elderly patients.

At worst they include cardiac arrest, breathing problems and brain damage - but these are very rare and less serious complications include nausea, headaches and temporary confusion.

Prince Philip’s doctors will have carefully weighed up these risks before deciding to carry out the operation.

The Duke of Edinburgh's latest bout of ill health comes after a series of recent health complications. 

He was taken into hospital in Aberdeen in August after being admitted with a recurrence of the bladder infection he suffered in June. 

The Duke spent almost a week in hospital after falling ill with the infection during the Diamond Jubilee. It was the third time in nine months the Duke has been in hospital. 

In 2011, he spent Christmas at Papworth Hospital in Cambridge after suffering chest pains. He underwent surgery for a blocked coronary artery, for which he had a stent fitted.

On Wednesday, the day before he was 
admitted to hospital, Philip visited the SS Robin, the world’s oldest 
complete steamship, at Royal Victoria Dock and in the evening held a 
dinner at Buckingham Palace for the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award world 
fellowship.

On Tuesday he was present at the 
Westminster Abbey celebrations to mark the anniversary of the Queen’s 
Coronation and in the evening he attended a dinner of the Corporation of
 Trinity House, the body overseeing the country’s lighthouses.

Before yesterday’s garden party, the 
Queen invested Philip with New Zealand’s highest honour at a 
presentation at Buckingham Palace, making him an additional member of 
the Order of New Zealand to mark the diamond jubilee.

The Duke will not be able to accompany
 her to open the BBC’s new £1billion home at Broadcasting House today 
and she will perform the engagement as planned.

On Wednesday, Peter Phillips spoke of his grandfather’s health during a TV interview.

He said: ‘You have got to remember his
 age, both of their ages, you know ... what they do at their age – they 
do a lot more than most other pensioners of their equivalent age.

‘If occasionally there is the odd engagement cancelled, it shouldn’t come as such a surprise, given the workload.’

The Queen has made clear that her husband’s devotion and support has been crucial to the success of her reign.

Last year she became the first British monarch to celebrate a 65th wedding anniversary.

The Queen and Philip first met in 1939
 when she was just 13 and he was a cadet asked to entertain George VI’s 
daughters at Dartmouth Naval College.

In a speech to mark their golden 
wedding anniversary in 1997, the Duke said of their marriage: ‘The main 
lesson we’ve learned is that tolerance is the one central ingredient of 
any happy marriage. It might not be so important when things are going well but it is absolutely vital when things get difficult.’
