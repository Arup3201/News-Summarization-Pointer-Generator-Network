Keepers at a British zoo have welcomed the arrival of a baby pygmy hippopotamus born to a cancer-stricken mother. 

The male calf weighs just seven kilos and has yet to be given a name, but is said to be enjoying the water pool at Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire. 

His mother Flora, who has two other young, gave birth on Boxing Day while battling a cancerous tumour in her mouth.  

The male calf was born on Boxing Day at Whipsnade Zoo in Bedfordshire. He is yet to be given a name, but is settling in well to life in the enclosure with his parents and older siblings

Due on Christmas Day, the calf was delivered after a six hour labour at the breeding zoo in December

The rare species of hippo is classed as endangered, with only 2,000 remaining in the wild.

They are the smaller cousins of the hippopotamus, weighing less than a 1/4 of an adult hippo once fully grown. 

After being welcomed on Boxing Day, the calf at Whipsnade Zoo has been settling into life with siblings Sappo and Georgina. 

The smaller cousin of the common hippopotamus, pygmy hippos are only half as tall and weigh a quarter of the larger breed. 

They are known to be gentler towards other animals, often ignoring each other in the wild.

Calves are known to spend their first few weeks staying close to water as their mothers forage for food.

Pygmy hippopotamuses originate in West Africa, and are largely nocturnal.

As such little is known of their day-to-day behaviour in the wild.

They have been listed as an endangered species by the London Zoological Society, with only 2,000 remaining in the wild. 

Predominantly found in Liberia, their population is most threatened by deforestation.

'Since the birth, the baby hippo has been happily waddling around and seems to love spending time in water,' said Steve White, a senior keeper at the zoo which nurtures several breeding programmes.

'On his first weigh-in, he was so slippery it was like picking up a big bar of soap.'

His mother Flora received treatments for cancer throughout her pregnancy which saw the calf born a day late.

'Flora's calf was due on Christmas Day, but the little one kept us waiting until the evening of Boxing Day,' added Mr White.

'We knew Flora must be going into labour because she went off her food which never happens.

'After a six-hour labour, the calf was born. He is a perfect miniature of his mum.'

'We're delighted for Flora, who has come through a difficult year and is now proving once again to be an attentive, experienced mum.

'She's contributed three calves to the European Endangered Species Breeding Programme and she will now retire from breeding.'

Weighing just seven kilos, the calf will stay close by his mother's side until weaning. He is the third calf born at Whipsnade Zoo as part of its endangered animals programme
