A Vietnam veteran was awarded the Medal of Honor by the President, more than 40 years after his acts of bravery.

Army Command Sergeant Major Bennie G. Adkins, now 80, fought enemy soldiers in close combat, dodging mortar rounds as he dragged wounded allies to safety and even refused to be evacuated, despite having wounds of his own.

Adkins, a special forces soldier, had the medal fastened around his neck with a blue ribbon by President Obama in a ceremony at the White House today.

The President also awarded the medal to another Vietnam veteran, Specialist Donald P. Sloat, who died after clinging to a live grenade to protect his fellow soldiers.  

President Barack Obama praised the soldiers as patriots whose sacrifices had never been fully realized by a nation divided over the legacy of the Vietnam War.

It took an act of Congress to allow each to receive the medal so many decades after the fact.

Pride: Adkins - who joked with Obama earlier today about re-enlisting - survived terrifying attacks in Vietnam

Obama is also due to give a posthumous Medal of Honor to First Lieutenant Alonzo H. Cushing, who withstood a huge Confederate advance before being killed at the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863, which will take place in the coming weeks.

'Over the decades, our Vietnam veterans didn't always receive the thanks and respect they deserved. That's a fact' Obama said in the East Room. 'But as we have been reminded again today, our Vietnam vets were patriots and are patriots.'

Commenting on the decades between the acts of bravery and the medal awards, Obama said: 'Sometimes even the most extraordinary stories can be lost in the fog of war or the passage of time.

'When new evidence comes to light, certain actions can be reconsidered for this honor, and it is entirely right and proper than we have done so and that is why we are here today.

'No matter how long it takes, no matter how many years go by we will continue to express our gratitude for your years of services.

'The nation is grateful, and your commander-in-chief couldn't be prouder.'

Sometimes even the most extraordinary stories can be lost in the fog of war or the passage of time.

Obama's audience included families of the honored men, who campaigned for their recognition, and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel - himself a Vietnam veteran.

Drafted into the Army at age 22 from his home in rural Oklahoma, Adkins was deployed three times to Vietnam with the Special Forces. He was already being recognized for actions during his second combat tour when, in 1966, a large North Vietnamese force attacked his camp.

For 38 hours, Adkins fought in close combat against enemy forces, dodging exploding mortar rounds as he dragged wounded soldiers to safety. When the order was finally given to evacuate camp, Adkins refused to leave comrades behind.

By the time he and his group made its way to the extraction point, the last evacuation helicopter had left. So Adkins led his fellow soldiers into the jungle, where they evaded enemy soldiers and even a tiger before being evacuated 48 hours later.

Adkins, now a much older version of himself and walking with a cane, stood tall in his blue uniform and epaulettes, saluting fellow troops after Obama draped the medal around his neck.

'This Medal of Honor belongs to the other 16 Special Forces soldiers with me,' Adkins said after the ceremony.

Sloat, of Coweta, Oklahoma, was killed in action on Jan. 17, 1970, at age 20.

While on patrol, a soldier in his squad triggered a hand grenade trap that had been placed in their path by enemy forces.

He picked up the live grenade, initially to throw it away. When he realized it was about to detonate, he shielded the blast with his own body in order to save the lives of his fellow soldiers.

Sloat's brother, William, accepted the medal from the president Monday.

The Medal of Honor is given to Armed Forces members who risk their lives in acts of great personal bravery.

Union Army soldier Alonozo H. Cushing was also due to be honored with the medal today, but was not mentioned during the ceremony at the White House.  

Despite having been wounded in the stomach and shoulder, he ordered his 110 men and six cannon to hold fast against an advancing force of 13,000 Confederate soldiers in a movement known as Pickett's Charge.

Struggle: Cushing fought and died in the three-day struggle between Unionist and Confederate forces

Cushing was born in Delafield, Wisconsin, raised in Fredonia, New York, and buried at his alma mater, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, after his death at age 22.

He commanded about 110 men and six cannons, defending the Union position on Cemetery Ridge against Pickett's Charge, a major Confederate thrust that was repelled by Union forces.

Wounds: Cushing ordered his men to hold fast, despite being seriously hurt himself

On the third day of battle, Cushing's small force stood its ground under severe artillery bombardment and an assault by nearly 13,000 advancing Confederate infantrymen. Already wounded in the stomach and the right shoulder, Cushing insisted on ordering his guns to the front lines. He eventually was shot and killed.

A White House statement said: 'His actions made it possible for the Union Army to successfully repulse the Confederate assault.'

The Medal of Honor has been bestowed on more than 1,500 soldiers who fought in the Civil War, with another soldier given his medal in 2001.
