Final hours of freedom: Rolf Harris was seen at his home in Bray, Berkshire, yesterday where he was believed to have been sorting out personal affairs before his sentencing on Friday

Shamed Rolf Harris spent his final hours of freedom sorting out his personal affairs on the penultimate day before he is due to be sentenced for a string of sex attacks.

Earlier this week the 84-year-old was convicted of 12 counts of abusing young girls, one of whom was as young as seven or eight.

He is due to be sentenced on Friday and could face a sentence of up to 24 years in jail - meaning he could die behind bars.

Yesterday, the penultimate day before his sentencing hearing at Southwark Crown Court , the grey-haired entertainer was seen being escorted from his riverside family home by men and women 
dressed in black believed to be legal advisors.

He later returned with 
just his driver and permanent security guard.

Harris was smartly dressed in a grey suit, white shirt and multi-coloured tie as he walked from the front door of his flower-bedecked home in Bray, Berkshire.

The artist and former entertainer who is on conditional bail ahead of his sentencing for sex crimes on Friday, was away from the house for just 20 minutes before returning sat in the back seat of a black Audi car.

There was no sign of his frail wife Alwen or daughter Bindi although both were believed to be spending the last 48 hours with Harris before he is likely to be sent to a prison cell.

Harris' appearance outside the pink petunia-clad front door of his £1.75million home was a rare sortie into the limelight because he has not been spotted at home for months.

The Australian looked stern as he chatted to his friends and assistants.

Bizarrely, he was not wearing cuff-links as his the cuffs of his shirt flapped around in the warm breeze.

Facing prison: Harris is due to be sentenced on Friday and could face a sentence of up to 24 years in jail - meaning he could die behind bars. He was seen at his home with people believed to be his legal team

Friends of the former national treasure are desperately worried for how his sick wife Alwen will cope alone after trial judge  Nigel Sweeney warned Harris on Monday that he faced a custodial sentence following his conviction for sex crimes.

'Given
 the conviction on all 12 counts, it's inevitable that the type of 
sentence uppermost in the court's mind is a custodial sentence,' the 
judge said.

He is also facing fresh allegations and possible police investigations in both the UK and Australia.

Harris
 was labelled a 'sinister pervert' during his eight-week London trial 
and on Monday, after eight days of deliberations, the jury unanimously 
backed the prosecutor's assessment.
