Vonterrious West, 22, would not have faced charges if he had stopped after hitting Keith Richardson, 32

A 22-year-old man has been charged with leaving the scene of a fatal accident after he struck a man who deliberately cycled in front of his car.

Vonterrious West was driving in his Chrysler 300 when he hit 32-year-old cyclist Keith Michael Richardson at 7.30pm Saturday.

Mr Richardson was found on the roadside of State Road 60 in Lake Wales, about 55 miles south of Orlando.

He was pronounced dead at the scene and his damaged bicycle was located nearby.

According to investigators, Mr Richardson had been drinking and argued with his girlfriend shortly before the crash.

He called his mother in Mississippi to say he was going to throw himself in front of a car on his bicycle.

Mr Richardson had first hurled himself in front of two other cars but the drivers swerved and missed him, officials said.

He was then his by West, who stopped to check check his vehicle for damage before getting back into the car and driving away, according to a witness.

Homicide detectives say West did not realize he had struck a person and would not have been charged if he had stayed at the scene.
