A Japanese prosthetics maker has found himself on an unexpected mission – making fake fingers for the mafia.

In the East Asian nation a chopped off pinkie signifies a membership of the Yakuza, the feared Japanese mafia, who are required to sever their own fingers to pay for offenses to the organisation.

For the past ten years, Shintaro Hayashi has been making prosthetic pinkies for members of the Yakuza who want to disguise their background in the underworld.

After building his career making silicone prosthetics for breast cancer patients and amputees he found himself with a new clientele.

‘I started to see a gradual increase in people who were asking for prosthetic pinkies,’ Hayashi, 39, told ABC News.

‘They weren't the standard small, medium or large, but custom-made pinkies.’

A missing pinkie is a telltale sign that someone is a past or present member of the Yakuza.

The ritual, known as ‘yubitsume’ is a way for members to ‘pay’ for committing offenses to the Yakuza, such as taking drugs, getting in fights or stealing.

Gruesome business: The Yakuza tradition of forcing members to cut their 
fingers off as punishment has seen a surge in clients for pinkie 
prosthetics

Replacement: A former yakuza member who has had to cut off his little and ring finger as punishment for breaking the 'code of conduct' shows off his prosthetics

Examples: Plastic surgeon Maria Niino, holds prosthetic fingers that she makes for Yakuza members

The little finger on the left hand is the first to go – often one joint at a time – but many Yakuza members are missing several digits.

Shintaro Hayashi helps ex-Yakuza disguise their past to help them find a job, or current members to hide their allegiance at family occasions or official outings.

One single finger prosthetic costs £1,925 and is custom made to fit the ‘yubitsume’ victim’s hand.

Most Yakuza customers visit Shintaro Hayashi’s workshop several times a year as the silicone is worn out or needs repainting.

Shintaro Hayashi estimates that around five per cent of his clients are former Yakuza members and has produced more than 300 prosthetic fingers.

New beginning: One of Shintaro Hayashi's ex-Yakuza clients shows off his
prosthetic little finger, which he got when he left the organisation 
and needed to disguise his past to get a job

He says his Yakuza clients come in three categories: former members who are looking for a career outside the mafia, members who need to cover up for a child’s wedding or a family event or men pushed by their partners who are worried about their reputation.

‘Many people keep a fist, to prevent detection,' he told ABC News.

'But there comes a point where you can't hide your fingers any longer. Some people have one joint severed, others have worse.’

The Yakuza is a collective term given to Japan's organised crime syndicates.

It is estimated that the Yakuza has over 100,000 members spread across the country in different gangs, but together they make the largest organised crime group in the world.

Victim: Some Yakuza members who have been part of the mafia for a long 
time has had several fingers fall to the gruesome 'yubitsume' tradition

Old practice: The 'yubitsume' always starts on with the first joints on the left hand little finger as this would weaken the way a traditional Japanese sword is held

They are known for their controlled organisation and strict codes of conduct, which involves punishments such as 'yubitsume' for members who break the rules.

The tradition of 'yubitsume', beginning with the first joints of the left hand little finger comes from the Japanese way of holding a sword with 'yubitsume' intended to weaken the Yakuza member’s sword grip.

A recent crackdown on the Yakuza has seen an increasing demand for prosthetic pinkies.

The number of members has been on the decline since the Japanese Government introduced the Anti-Organized Crime Law in 1992 and as recent as last year, the US Treasury Department froze assets for the largest Yakuza ‘family’, the Yamaguchi-gumi,

Shintaro Hayashi can only see his client base expand, and adds: ‘If you put on the finger, you can turn your life around.’
