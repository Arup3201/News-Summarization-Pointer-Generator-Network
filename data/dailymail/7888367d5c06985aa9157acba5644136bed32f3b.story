The BBC has come under fire for re-hiring 700 people  who it had previously spent £10.3million on making redundant.

It has emerged that of the 700 staff members who took redundancy packages, more than 400 are now back at the broadcaster working as freelancers.

Last night the Taxpayers' Alliance criticised what it described as the BBC's 'lucrative revolving door'.

John O'Connell, the director of the Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'Licence-fee payers will be furious that their cash is being wasted on generous golden goodbyes, only for those made "redundant" to walk back in on a new salary,' the Sun on Sunday reported.

A BBC spokesperson told the paper it was common to have seasonal freelancers in the journalism industry as it helped keep costs down.

News of the spending comes amid a row over the corporation's plans to broadcast a story imagining the assassination of Margaret Thatcher.

The fantasy, written by bestselling author Hilary Mantel, was condemned as ‘perverted’ and ‘distasteful’ when it was published in September.

Despite this, Radio 4 has selected the story for its prestigious Book At Bedtime slot – sparking a furious backlash.

Supporters of the former Prime Minister accused the broadcaster of being deliberately provocative with a move that will stoke accusations of BBC bias against the Tories.

‘It is a sick book from a sick mind and it’s being promoted by a sick broadcasting corporation,’ former Cabinet Minister Lord Tebbit said.

Lord Tebbit's wife Margaret was paralysed when the IRA tried to murder Margaret Thatcher and her Cabinet in the 1984 Brighton bombing.

Ms Mantel’s story depicts the callous murder of the former Prime Minister by an IRA gunman and was inspired by the Booker Prize-winning author’s own fantasy about assassinating Lady Thatcher, who she admits to ‘detesting’.

The broadcast on January 9 will increase tensions between the BBC and the Government after David Cameron and George Osborne accused the Corporation of bias in its coverage of spending cuts.
