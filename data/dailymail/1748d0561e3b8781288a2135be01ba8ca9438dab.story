Wigan Warriors have released forward Eddy Pettybourne for personal reasons.

The Warriors have announced the 26-year-old will leave the club with immediate effect, halfway through a two-year contract.

Pettybourne, a New Zealand-born United States international, made 18 appearances in an injury-hit 2014 season after arriving from Wests Tigers.

Pettybourne said: 'I have enjoyed my time here but sometimes things happen outside your control and this means I have to head back home.'

Pettybourne's Wigan career got off to an inglorious start as he incurred a one-match ban for a high tackle in February's World Club Challenge.

He suffered various injuries after that but his release comes just a week after he gave an interview in which he spoke of his determination to 'step up and play good footy' for Wigan.

He has also been with the Warriors squad at a winter training camp in the US but the club have now agreed to his release.

General manager Kris Radlinski said: 'Things have happened pretty quickly and escalated since we flew to Florida for our training camp.

'Being away allowed us to have some deep conversations and in the circumstances it is clearly best for Eddy to cut short his stay and return home to Australia.'

Coach Shaun Wane said: 'He has fitted really well into the Wigan way and I personally am very sorry to see him leave but totally understand his reasons for doing so.

'We are a strong family-orientated club and will support Eddy in the future. I wish him the best of luck.'
