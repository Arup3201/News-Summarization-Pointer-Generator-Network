A man suspected of killing two deputies during a shooting rampage in Northern California was deported twice to Mexico and had a drug conviction, federal authorities said Saturday.

The suspected shooter told Sacramento County Sheriff's investigators that he was 34-year-old Marcelo Marquez of Salt Lake City. However, his fingerprints match the biometric records of a Luis Enrique Monroy-Bracamonte in a federal database, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Virginia Kice said.

Monroy-Bracamonte was first removed from the country in 1997 after being convicted in Arizona for possession of narcotics for sale. Monroy-Bracamonte was arrested and sent packing to Mexico a second time in 2001, Kice said.

Victims: Michael Davis Jr., 42 (left), was a 15-year veteran sheriff's deputy. Deputy Danny Oliver, the first officer to be shot, was a father

Shooter: Marcelo Marquez, 34, of Salt Lake City, fled police but was eventually flushed out of a home he hid in for several hours using gas bombs. He and a female companion are now in custody

'The fingerprints were the basis for our request for an immigration detainer,' she said.

The detainer requests that local authorities turn him over to federal custody after his case is adjudicated so ICE can purse his deportation, Kice said.

The suspect was being held without bail on suspicion of two counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and two counts of carjacking.

His wife, 38-year-old Janelle Marquez Monroy, was also in custody on suspicion of attempted murder and carjacking after the attack on Friday that left two deputies dead and two other victims wounded.

Investigators spent Saturday at the multiple crime scenes 'trying to kind of sort through the chaos so we can methodically rebuild this,' Placer County Sheriff Ed Bonner said.

The two suspects were questioned for hours as authorities sought a motive for the shootings that began when Sacramento County sheriff's Deputy Danny Oliver, 47, was shot in the forehead with an assault rifle at close range as he checked out a suspicious car in a motel parking lot.

The suspects have talked to investigators, Bonner said, but what sparked the shootings remained unclear.

'"Why," I guess, will remain a question for a long time,' he said. 'Why was his reaction so violent?'

It was also unclear what brought the heavily armed suspects from Utah to California, Bonner said. There were no indications they had been sought by authorities.

A veteran sheriff's deputy and father-of-four who was one of two officers gunned down in a shooting rampage that spanned 30 miles across California on Friday died exactly 26 years to the day that his own father was killed in the line of duty.

Michael Davis Jr., 42, was shot dead by a male and female couple who were on the run from killing another deputy in Sacramento earlier in the day.

His death tragically mimicked that of his father, Michael Davis Sr., who was killed on the job on the same day in 1988.

The incident started about 10.30am in the parking lot of the Motel 6 in Sacramento.

Sacramento County Deputy Danny Oliver, 47, approached a suspicious-looking car, but the occupants immediately opened fire.

He was shot in the forehead with an assault rifle at close range and did not have time to draw his weapon. He died in the hospital. 

Oliver, a 15-year veteran of the department, was the first Sacramento County deputy killed since 2008.

He left a wife and two daughters.

After Oliver was shot, his partner fired at the attackers, who drove about a mile before attempting a carjacking.

The attackers then stole a red Ford pickup from a gardener and fled to the Sierra Nevada foothills city of Auburn in neighboring Placer County, about 30 miles northeast of Sacramento.

Unprovoked: The suspects immediately opened fire, police said

That is when officer Michael Davis Jr. and his partner spotted the car parked alongside the road.

Both were shot with an AR-15-type assault weapon, Placer County sheriff's spokeswoman Dena Erwin said.

Davis, who had been working in law enforcement since 1996 - the last 10 years a homicide investigator - died from his injuries.

His partner Jeff Davis - no relation - a 17-year department veteran, was treated for a gunshot wound in the arm. 

Police suspect the shooter was 34-year-old Marcelo Marquez of Salt Lake City, who was being held on suspicion of two counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and two counts of carjacking.

A woman with him, 38-year-old Janelle Marquez Monroy, was in custody on suspicion of attempted murder and two counts of carjacking.

Monroy was arrested at the scene where Davis was killed.

Police found a handgun in her purse.

Deputies finally used tear gas to flush Marquez from the basement of the home where he hid for several hours. 

Arrested: This is the man police believe was behind the rampage that claimed the lives of two officers. Marcelo Marquez was being held on suspicion of two counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and two counts of carjacking

Evacuated: The area was placed on lock-down as police tried to flush out the suspect, who was hiding in a nearby house

Jail records contained no indications that either suspect had outstanding arrest warrants.

Both were being held without bail. Initial court appearances were expected Tuesday.

A search of Utah court records for Marquez shows a history of about 10 tickets and misdemeanor traffic offenses between 2003 and 2009. 

Those records list one speeding ticket for Monroy in 2009 and three small claims filings attempting to collect outstanding debts. 

The slaying of the deputies was the single deadliest day for California law enforcement since February 2013.

In separate incidents that month, former Los Angeles police officer Christopher Dorner killed two law enforcement officers, and two Santa Cruz police detectives were shot and killed.
