Committed to the cause: A Tibetan mother has died after setting herself on fire in protest over China's occupation of the country in the same spot in Barma where two people self-immolated last month (above)

A Tibetan mother has died after setting fire to herself outside a monastery in the latest protest against China's occupation of the country.

Rechok, a nomad in her 30s who has three children, died outside the Jonang Dzamthang monastery in Barma Township this afternoon.

Her body is currently in the monastery and Tibetans have been gathering for her cremation, which is expected to be held this evening.

Rechok spent the last few days in the mountains tending to the family’s animals before travelling into the town ready to give her life.

She has two daughters aged nine and 15, and a 17-year-old son.

There have now been four self-immolations in Barma in 2012 and Rechok is one of more than 30 Tibetans who have engulfed themselves in flames over the last year.

In January, state security forces shot dead a young man who had been trying to prevent a friend being arrested for posting leaflets in the town claiming that self-immolations will continue until Tibet is free.

Reports say the death may have been the catalyst for the fatal protests in Barma.

Stephanie Brigden, director of 
campaign group Free Tibet, said: 'Barma Township is like many other 
places in Tibet - people from all walks of life are rejecting Chinese 
rule and going to extraordinary lengths to make their calls for freedom 
heard.

'Tibetan calls for freedom continue to spread. The international community must break their silence on Tibet.'

Rechok's
death comes three days after one man was killed and another badly 
injured when they set themselves alight outside a temple in the Tibetan 
capital Lhasa on Sunday.

It was the first time the tiny country's tightly guarded capital had been targeted.

Vigorous campaign: There have been at least 34 self-immolations in the last year to highlight China's restrictions on Buddhism and to call for the return from exile of the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama (pictured)

Chinese authorities identified the dead 
man as 19-year-old Tobgye Tseten  and the other man as Dargye, while 
American sources claim the two men were both waiters at a nearby 
restaurant.

There have been at least 34 such protests since March of last year to draw attention to China's restrictions on Buddhism and to call for the return from exile of the Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama.

Most have taken place in heavily Tibetan areas of China, but only one had occurred in Tibet itself and none in the capital.

Protests have become rare in remote Tibet and Lhasa in particular because of tight police security that has blanketed the area since anti-government riots erupted in Lhasa in 2008.

Radio Free Asia reported on Monday that Lhasa was under heavy police and paramilitary guard following the immolations and that the situation was very tense.

China's official news agency Xinhua blamed the protests on separatists and said the incidents were handled quickly and order restored.

Two months ago, a Tibetan protester set himself on fire in India during a demo against a visit by the Chinese president.

Jamphel Yeshi sustained burns to 98 per cent of his body when he sprinted for 50m outside the Indian Parliament building engulfed in flames.

He later died.

China says Tibet has always been part of its territory, but many Tibetans say the Himalayan region was virtually independent for centuries until Chinese troops invaded in the 1950s.

Beijing blames the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, for fanning anti-government sentiment and routinely purges monasteries and nunneries, where support for the Dalai Lama and Tibetan independence runs high.

Angry and desperate Tibetans have taken to self-immolation in protest, as many as 34 since last March.

Last November a 35-year-old nun was captured in a horrifying video after setting herself alight on a Chinese street.

And in March a Tibetan man self-immolated in New Delhi, India, to protest a visit by the Chinese president.

The centuries-long tradition has become a type of radical political protest and more than 500 have been reported in Western media since the 1960s.

But debate rages over the controversial method of protest. Some Buddhists say suicide is violence, and therefore unacceptable, while others see self-sacrifice for a greater cause as legitimate.
