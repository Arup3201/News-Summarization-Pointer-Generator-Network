Much ado about nothing? The Vatican claims Williams Shakespeare was Catholic

The Vatican has reignited the debate over whether playwright William Shakespeare was Catholic by insisting there was 'little doubt he was'.

Historians have been in two minds over Shakespeare's faith with splits between whether he was a Roman Catholic or a Protestant and the argument has surfaced again with the release of blockbuster film Anonymous.

The political thriller stars Rafe Spall and Rhys Ifans and is set against the backdrop of 16th Century England and controversially claims that Britain's most prolific playwright was in fact a fraud and cover for the then Earl of Oxford.

Questions have also long surrounded 
his religion and there is little direct evidence of his faith, although 
he is buried in the Protestant church of Holy Trinity in Stratford Upon 
Avon, historians say there is some evidence that he was secretly 
Catholic.

However the Vatican's official 
newspaper L'Osservatore Romano in an article headlined: 'More Catholic 
than anonymous' insisted that although 'Shakespeare's identity was the 
matter of debate his religious faith was not.'

L'Osservatore - which last week 
published an article praising new film Tintin - added that in its belief
 Shakespeare 'convincingly adhered to the Catholic faith,' pinning its 
argument on the fact that in his famous play Hamlet he spoke of 
purgatory.

According to the Roman Catholic faith purgatory is the place souls go to after death and is between Heaven and Hell and where they are purified - the belief, as L'Osservatore notes is not shared with the Church of England and would have been evident in 'Elizabeth's violently anti-Catholic England'.

The newspaper went on: 'Shakespeare's identity will long be the subject of morbid curiosity but there can be little doubt over his faith,' adding that although he was 'a member of that Protestant society proudly and cruelly defended by Queen Elizabeth the reality was very different'.

purgatory within the play convinced the Vatican that 
Shakespeare must have been Catholic

L'Osservatore also picked up on a comment made by the Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Rowan Williams, earlier this year at the Hay on Wye book festival in which he said: 'William Shakespeare in all probability was Catholic.'

In 1559, five years before Shakespeare was born, England finally severed its links with the Catholic church and everyone was forced to accept the Church of England or face the ultimate punishment - although some historians have claimed that Shakespeare's parents secretly maintained their faith.

His school teachers were also Catholic and he is said to have married his wife Anne Hathaway in a secret Catholic ceremony while other historians point to his ridiculing of the Pope in his play The Life and Death of King John describing him as an 'unworthy and ridiculous Italian priest'.

Shakespeare grew up after the start of the Protestant reformation, at a time of fierce persecution of Catholics in England.

In 1530 - 34 years before the birth of Shakespeare - King Henry VIII quarreled with the Pope, who refused to give Henry the divorce he wanted for political reasons.

In 1534 Henry established the Church of England as the official state church, nominally Protestant, with the monarch as head - 'defender of the faith'.

England turned against Catholicism. Religious statues and stained glass windows were removed, shrines and saints' relics destroyed and cathedrals, abbeys and monasteries were stripped of their valuables.

Massacres of Protestants in France in 1572, the Spanish Armada in 1588 and the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 confirmed the popular belief in England that Catholics and the Pope would bring tyranny.

Others point to Sonnet 124 that Shakespeare wrote, in which he referred to the 'fools of time, which die for goodness and who have lived for crime' as referring to Jesuit Catholics who were executed for treason between 1594 and 95.

There is evidence which shows he was baptised in the Church of England church of Holy Trinity in Stratford Upon Avon where he was buried in 1616 and his grave is visited by more than 200,000 tourists every year.

In a complete reversal some historians have even suggested that Shakespeare was possibly an atheist and to add an element of Dan Brown to the argument in 2009 three mysterious signatures were discovered at the Venerable English College in Rome which has been a training college for Catholic priests for centuries.

Kept under lock and key for security reasons they read 'Arthurus Stratfordus Wigomniensis 1585' and 'Gulielmus Clerkue Starfordiensis 1589' which according to then vice rector Father Andrew Headon could be read as 'King Arthur's compatriot from the Stratford in the diocese of Worcester' and 'William the clerk from Stratford.'

A third signature from 1587 reads 'Shfordus Cestriensis' which he said could stand for 'Shakespeare from the Stratford in the diocese of Chester,' and all three are dates during the so called wilderness years of the playwright from 1585 to 1592.

As several of his plays are set in Italy there is a belief among many that he visited the country then during that seven year period and may even have stayed in the college in Rome which was also a safe haven for Catholics fleeing persecution in Elizabethan England.

Today, Stanley Wells, one of Britain's most authoritative experts on Shakespeare and chairman of the Shakespeare's Birthplace Trust in Stratford Upon Avon, was not immediately available for comment.
