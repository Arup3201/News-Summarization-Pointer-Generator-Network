Oprah Winfrey and other stars from the Martin Luther King biopic Selma marched with hundreds of others on Sunday ahead of the holiday to mark the  civil rights leader's achievements.

Winfrey, who produced and starred in Selma,  marched hand-in-hand with the film's director, Ava DuVernay, actor David Oyelowo, who portrayed King in the movie, and the rapper Common.

They marched from Selma City Hall to the city's Edmund Pettus Bridge, where civil rights protesters were beaten and tear-gassed by officers in 1965.

'Every single person who was on that bridge is a hero,' Winfrey told the marchers before they walked up the bridge as the sun was going down over the Alabama River.

Their steps in tribute to Dr King in Alabama came as key black members of Congress elsewhere invoked recent police shootings of young black men as evidence that reforms are needed to ensure equal justice for all.

Winfrey said those who came to Selma were seeking to remember 'Martin Luther King as an idea, Selma as an idea and what can happen with strategy, with discipline and with love'. 

Winfrey played the civil rights activist Annie Lee Cooper in the movie, which has been nominated for two Oscars, in categories of best picture and best original song.

A new march, led by Martin Luther King Jr., began on March 21 of 1965 and arrived in Montgomery days later with the crowd swelling to 25,000

Selma chronicled the campaign leading up to the historic march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, and the subsequent passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act.

Law enforcement officers used clubs and tear gas on March 7, 1965 — Bloody Sunday — to rout marchers intent on walking some 50 miles to Montgomery, the Alabama capital, to seek the right for blacks to register to vote. 

A new march, led by Martin Luther King Jr., began on March 21 of that year and arrived in Montgomery days later with the crowd swelling to 25,000.

On Sunday, the Selma bridge and adjoining downtown business district look much as they did in 1965, though many storefronts are empty and government buildings are occupied largely by African-American officials who are beneficiaries of the Voting Rights Act.

Lisa Stevens brought her two children, aged six and ten, so they could walk the bridge that King walked. 

'I wanted to bring my children here so they can know their history and for them to participate in this walk,' said Stevens, who moved recently from New York to Greensboro, Alabama.

'It's a part of their history and I think that they should know. Being that we're in the South now I want them to understand everything that is going on around them,' Stevens added.

McLinda Gilchrist, 63, said the movie should help a younger generation understand what life was like in the 1960s during the struggle to end racial discrimination. 

'They treated us worse than animals,' Gilchrist said of how the original marchers were treated.

'It was terrifying,' recalled Lynda Blackmon Lowery, who still lives in Selma, Alabama, and was the youngest person to march there in 1965 as a teenager. 

A mother and grandmother who is now 65, she spoke on Sunday in New York of a harrowing experience of unarmed marchers going up against rifles, billy clubs and fierce dogs.  She has since written a memoir, 'Turning 15 on the Road to Freedom.'

Common and John Legend performed their Oscar-nominated song Glory from the movie as marchers crested the top of the bridge amid the setting sun.

For Monday's federal holiday, people around the country were remembering King's leadership, some in light of the fatal police shootings that had recently shaken the U.S., including the death of unarmed black teen Michael Brown last year in Ferguson, Missouri.

Eight members of the Congressional Black Caucus joined U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay at Wellspring United Methodist Church in Ferguson on Sunday as they invoked King's legacy. They vowed to seek criminal justice reform.

'We need to be outraged when local law enforcement and the justice system repeatedly allow young, unarmed black men to encounter police and then wind up dead with no consequences,' the St. Louis Democrat said. 'Not just in Ferguson, but over and over again across this country.'

Other events planned on Monday include a wreath-laying in Maryland, a King tribute breakfast in Boston, Massachusetts, and volunteer service activities by churches and community groups in Illinois. In South Carolina, civil rights leaders readied for their biggest rally of the year in Columbia.

The life and legacy of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. also was being celebrated at the church he pastored in Atlanta. The current pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, the Rev. Raphael Warnock, said the annual King holiday is a time when 'all of God's children are busy spreading the message of freedom and justice.'

In the Sunday sermon, Professor James Cone of New York's Union Theological Seminary urged Ebenezer's congregation to celebrate the slain civil rights leader 'by making a political and a religious commitment to complete his work of justice.'  

Winfrey tweeted to her more than 24 million followers on Twitter that she was celebrating the film in Selma
