Coleen Rooney and Victoria Beckham may have made the word WAG synonymous with football, glitz and glamour but there's a new breed of WAG in town and they have landed in Wimbledon.

This
year's pack of loyal tennis wives and girlfriends are adding a spot of more subtle glamour to the sideline.

And while all eyes may have been on Andy Murray's stunning girlfriend Kim Sears, there's another natural beauty keen to make headlines.

Novak Djokovic's girlfriend Jelena Ristic has been unveiled as the face - and incredibly toned body! - of Figleaves' new summer campaign. And judging by the photos, she is obviously keen to give Kim a run for her money in the glamour stakes.

Posing on location in sunny Monaco, Jelena serves up the key looks for this season, from tropical prints to bold colour blocking and striking nautical stripes.

Lounging around poolside on a sun lounger, the Serbian born and raised beauty models the brand's summer edition of swimming costumes, kaftans and bohemian skirts.

Wearing a conservative polka dot swimming costume, the 27-year-old proves that you can still cover up and look sexy.

Jelena has been dating her tennis ace beau for around six years and she is reportedly a big 
tennis fan, enjoying playing as well as watching her beau.

She met the Serbian tennis star at Sport High School and her mother described it as love at first sight.

Novak has previously said that Jelena is his biggest support and driving force in life, making him calm and stable ahead of his big matches.

Although Jelena spends most of her time on tour with her World Number 1 boyfriend, she still managed to finish her studies in Milan obtaining a Masters Degree with honors.

Proving that she is both beauty and brains, Jelena is reportedly now keen to study a PhD in management.

She is also
incredibly passionate about bringing education to underprivileged 
children and she and Novak set up a foundation, which she works with tirelessly.

The Djokovic Foundation, which enables children from disadvantaged communities to grow up, play and develop in creative and safe settings, is an integral part of her life and 
she spends her time actively working with children to help them to 
develop their skills.
