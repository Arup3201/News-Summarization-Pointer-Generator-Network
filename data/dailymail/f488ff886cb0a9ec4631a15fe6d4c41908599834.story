Almost 30 people are still unaccounted for following the fatal Amtrak train crash that took six lives.

The driver of the truck that ploughed through the Nevada rail crossing into the California Zephyr, and the train conductor - Laurette Lee, 68, of South Lake Tahoe, California - were among the dead.

But there is still confusion as 28 people are unaccounted for, and a passenger manifest suggests a different number of people on the train to the figure given by an Amtrak spokesman.

Tragedy: Train conductor Laurette Lee, 68, left, of South Lake Tahoe, California - was among the six dead in the Amtrak crash in Nevada last Friday, but 30 people are still unaccounted for

Ms Lee came from a railroad family, 
with her great-grandfather and grandfather working for railroad 
companies, her brother an Amtrak dispatcher and her nephew an Amtrak 
conductor.

Two truck drivers and a train 
engineer watched helplessly as the semi-trailer skidded the length of a 
football field before it smashed through crossing gates and into two 
double-decker cars of the train.

The drivers were part of a 
three-truck convoy that saw the gates come down and the warning lights 
go off as the train approached. They stopped, but the driver of the big 
rig in the lead did not.

Investigators plan to look over the 
scene for any clues as to why the truck driver skidded through the 
railroad crossing on Friday - but it's expected to take up to a year to 
pinpoint the cause of the crash.

The unaccounted figure is ‘spongy’ as
some passengers may have got off before the crash or walked away without
telling officials, National Transportation Safety Board member Earl 
Weener said.

‘This is not quite like you are used 
to when you get on an airplane. They record exactly who gets on, and 
what seat they sit in,’ he said. ‘On a train, you can get off without 
necessarily being tracked.’

About 20 people were injured, and the train's assistant conductor was among those seriously hurt.

Mr Weener said a passenger manifest 
counted 210 on board, but an Amtrak spokeswoman said 204 passengers and 
14 crew members were on the train at the time.

‘We are going to be working in the 
next several days to get more of that (unaccounted) number down the best
we can,’ Mr Weener said.

At the time of the collision, Mr Weener said visibility was excellent and the crossing gates and warning lights were working.

The train's engineer saw the truck 
approaching the crossing about 70 miles east of Reno and realised the 
collision was inevitable, he said.

‘He recalled the event clearly. He 
saw the truck approaching the train. At some point, he
knew the impact was imminent. He was hoping the train was not going to 
derail'

The engineer slammed on the emergency
brakes, but the train, which was going about 78 mph in an 80mph zone, 
travelled a half-mile more before it finally stopped.

The engineer watched the truck smash into two of the train's 10 cars through the rear-view mirror.

‘He recalled the event clearly. He 
saw the truck approaching the train,’ Mr Weener said. ‘At some point, he
knew the impact was imminent. He was hoping the train was not going to 
derail.'

National Transportation Safety Board 
investigators were returning to the crash site on Sunday to search for 
more possible victims and try to rectify discrepancies in the passenger 
manifest.

Statement: An Amtrak spokesman said they are saddened by any injuries that happen and appreciated the response by emergency services

The California Zephyr from Chicago, Illinois, 
was about 300 miles east of its destination in Emeryville, California, 
when the truck hit the two train cars, which burst into flames.

‘It was like a bomb exploded. Like a war zone, it was 
crazy. Bloody people everywhere'

Witnesses had said the truck driver 
didn't attempt to stop before it drove through the crossing, but Mr 
Weener said the driver did try to stop because the truck skidded about 
320ft before it crashed.

The speed of the truck hasn't been 
determined, but Mr Weener said it was going ‘at a considerable speed’ 
because the impact left the tractor embedded in one of the train cars.

The truck driver who died was a 
Nevada man in his mid-40s, Mr Weener said. Churchill County authorities 
said they were working to confirm other victims' identities and notify 
family members.

Passenger Justin Rhine told Fox News 
after the crash: ‘It was like a bomb exploded. Like a war zone, it was 
crazy. Bloody people everywhere.’

Walking away: A truck drove into the side of the train with 204 passengers and 14 staff at a rail crossing

Abel Ortiz, 42, of San Jose, California, said he was sleeping on the side of the car that was struck.

'As I looked up, I saw the train 
being ripped up. It created an opening in our car. I saw the flames come
over the windows of the side, like a quick flash of flames. Then smoked
filled up everything.’

'There was a big bang and an 
explosion and an unbelievable amount of fire went by the window. It scared the living daylights out of 
me'

Eugene Rheault, New 
Hampshire

Eugene Rheault of Manchester, New 
Hampshire, was on a trip from Yellowstone National Park to San Francisco
when the accident occurred.

'There was a big bang and an 
explosion and an unbelievable amount of fire went by the window,' he 
told the Reno Gazette-Journal. 'It scared the living daylights out of 
me.'

The accident shut down a section of 
U.S. 95 between Interstate 80 and Fallon, Nevada. The tracks cross the 
highway about three miles south of I-80 in the heart of the Forty-Mile 
Desert.

This was considered one of the 
deadliest sections of the entire overland journey by California-bound, 
covered-wagon pioneers in the 19th century.

There have been no accidents or 
incidents reported there in the last 20 years, according to the Federal 
Railroad Safety Administration.
