Four out of five monkeys stolen during a zoo break-in have been found.

Three cotton-top tamarins, a critically endangered species, and two emperor tamarins were taken from Blackpool Zoo last Tuesday after a hole was cut in a perimeter fence and locks taken off two enclosures.

Each of the rare creatures would be worth thousands on the black market.

Five monkeys were stolen from Blackpool Zoo, Lancashire in a late-night raid. The five monkeys included this baby cotton-top tamarin and two female cotton-top tamarins which are critically-endangered species

One of the stolen female cotton-top tamarins, which were born in primate at the zoo, was pregnant

One of the stolen monkeys was three months pregnant.

As alerts were raised, experts warned the baby monkey who was snatched will die if separated from its mother.

On Friday night, four of the monkeys were found in a cardboard box 80 miles away in Bradford.

Police said the creatures had been targeted specifically and their details had been circulated to ports and airports.

The National Wildlife Crime Unit was also involved in the hunt.

On Facebook, the zoo said it was ‘delighted’ and that the monkeys’ keeper had travelled to West Yorkshire to collect them.

The monkeys, which included this emperor tamarin, are said to need specialist care in order to survive

There are just 6,000 cotton-top tamarin monkeys left in the wild in their native Colombia, with numbers reduced by deforestation.

It is one of the most critically-endangered - and smallest - primates in the world.

The species was listed in the 'The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates' between 2008 and 2012.

The species is found in tropical forests in northwestern Colombia. Its diet includes insects and plant extracts.

It is thought that, historically, up to 40,000 cotton-top tamarins were caught and exported for use in biomedical research.

Staff at the zoo said the remaining monkeys have been 'quiet and subdued' since the incident

But in 1976, they were given the highest level of protection and all international trade was banned.

But the species is still at risk, because their natural habitat is being destroyed.

The lowland forest in Colombia has been reduced to five percent of its previous area.

The cotton-top tamarin is easily spotted by the long white crest reaching from its forehead to its shoulders.

The emperor tamarin is native to the Amazon rainforest.

Its name is derived from its imperial-looking long white moustache.
