Meet Jewel, a tiny black Chihuahua with paralyzed hind legs found helplessly wandering the streets of Sacramento, California.

When Jewel made her first media appearance, she was hobbling around, dragging her little legs behind her as she struggled to move.

Now she’s zipping around like a pint-size greyhound.

On the go: Now Jewel has a new set of wheels to help her get around

A big-hearted stranger appeared out of the blue and donated a new wheelchair to help Jewel get around, Fox40 reports.

‘She’s an amazing little dog,’ Gina Knepp of the Sacramento City Animal Shelter told Fox40.

The shelter didn’t have the heart to euthanize Jewel so now they are hoping someone out there can provide the kind of home and care she needs.

‘Someone who is home, someone possible retired and who doesn’t live in a two story house,’ says Knepp.

For those interested in adopting Jewel, contact the City of Sacramento Animal Care Services at 2127 Front Street, Sacramento, CA 95818 or call 916-808-7387.
