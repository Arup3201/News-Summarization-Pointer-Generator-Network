Former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn once tried to seduce France's new First Lady Valerie Trierweiler when he was an MP in Paris, a new book has claimed.

But the economist was snubbed after he attempted his 'chat up line' on French president Francois Hollande's glamorous girlfriend.

The latest revelations about 63-year-old Strauss-Kahn's notorious womansing were made in a new biography by French journalists Raphaelle Bacque and Ariane Chemin.

DSK, married to former television presenter Anne Sinclair, approached Ms Trierweiler while she was working as a political reporter in Paris ten years ago, the book claims.

He asked her: 'And how is the prettiest journalist in Paris?'

But the new First Lady, now 47, hit back swiftly: 'I thought that was Anne Sinclair.'

The book also recounts how former President Nicolas Sarkozy 'laughed uncontrollably' when told that Strauss-Kahn had been caught with prostitutes at a woodland orgy in Paris.

His security chief Alain Gardere told Mr Sarkozy in 2007 that police had come across Strauss-Kahn cavorting with hookers in Paris's sleazy Bois de Boulogne a year earlier.

An officer discovered DSK in a car having a group sex session with several prostitutes and reported the matter to police chiefs.

The new book, called Les Strauss-Khan, says: 'When Mr Sarkozy was informed he broke out into an uncontrollable throaty laugh.'

But he then swore his officials to secrecy because Strauss-Kahn was about to be appointed as the new boss of the International Monetary Fund in Washington DC.

Mr Sarkozy is quoted as saying: 'He will no doubt get the IMF job. Let's keep this to ourselves, alright?'

But the president later warned Mr Strauss-Kahn about his behaviour once he was working in the US, telling him: 'Over there they don't joke about this sort of thing.

'Your life will be passed under a magnifying glass. Avoid taking the lift alone with interns. France cannot permit a scandal.'

Strauss-Kahn - once tipped as the next president of France - then became embroiled in a catalogue of sex scandals after being arrested for trying to rape a New York hotel chambermaid in May last year.

After being held in New York's notorious Ryker's Island prison, criminal charges were dropped and he returned to France only to face similar accusations of sexually abusing a young French writer.

When those allegations were also dropped, he was then charged with with conspiring with pimps in Lille, northern France, to procure girls for sex parties around the world.

One hooker has told police that Strauss-Kahn took part in a gang rape at a group sex session, but she has not yet made an official complaint.

Another call girl told investigators the orgies she attended with Strauss-Kahn and his cronies were 'like cattle markets'.

She added: 'It was just pure sexual consumption, and these sessions often became bestial and violent.'

Strauss-Kahn is currently on 100,000 euros bail and banned from leaving France or speaking to witnesses until prosecutors decide if he should be brought to trial.
