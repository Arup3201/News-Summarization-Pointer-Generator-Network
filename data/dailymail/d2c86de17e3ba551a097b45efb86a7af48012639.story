Casey Anthony will have to give videotaped evidence in the case of a woman who claims Anthony ruined her reputation.

Anthony told detectives in 2008 that her two-year-old daughter, Caylee, was kidnapped by a 'Zanny the nanny' Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez from the Sawgrass Apartments in Orlando.

However, police later discovered that no nanny of that name existed.

Trial: Casey Anthony told detectives Caylee was kidnapped by Zenaida Fernandez-Gonzalez. A woman with the same name, right, is now suing for defamationÂ 

A 42-year-old mother of six with the same name is suing Anthony for defamation, claiming she lost her flat and her job as a housekeeper and found it impossible to find work in the three years Anthony maintained the lie.

Her lawyer said earlier this year that after Anthony's claims were made public, Fernandez-Gonzalez also received death threats in the middle of the night against her and her children.

Caylee's remains were found in woods near Anthony's family's home.

At
the beginning of Anthony's murder 
trial her lawyer told the court that Caylee accidentally drowned in the 
family's swimming pool and dropped the bombshell that the nanny never 
existed.

Yesterday, a judge set
the deposition for early October, and she left open the possibility 
that the videotape and a transcript of the deposition will be sealed 
from public release.

However, Anthony's lawyers said yesterday that she will refuse to answer questions during the deposition about lies to investigators.

Charles Greene said Anthony 'will assert the Fifth Amendment' at 
the deposition in the civil case, meaning she will invoke her 
constitutional right to remain silent.

Gonzalez's lawyer John Dill said he still
wanted to proceed to find out which questions Anthony would refuse to 
answer and whether there might be grounds to challenge her silence.

Her
civil lawyer argued that the defamation claim will fail. Anthony told 
detectives Caylee had been kidnapped by a woman named Zenaida Fernandez 
Gonzalez.

But the woman behind the lawsuit is named Zenaida Gonzalez, he said.

Circuit Judge Lisa Munyon is expected to
set the pre-trial date for the case in April or May. The trial is 
estimated to last for 10 days.

Anthony, 25, was found not guilty of murder, aggravated child abuse and aggravated manslaughter on July 5 and was released from prison.

She was convicted of four counts of lying to police.

She is now on probation for cheque fraud at an undisclosed location in Florida.

Her whereabouts have been kept secret because she has received death threats.
