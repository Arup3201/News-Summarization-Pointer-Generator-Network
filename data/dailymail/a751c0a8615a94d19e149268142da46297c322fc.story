Families that eat together stay slim together.

A study found that children who regularly sit down to breakfast or dinner with their parents are thinner than those who eat alone.

The finding is important because fat children tend to become fat adults and obesity can knock up to a decade of life, as well as raise the odds of a host of illnesses.

In Britain, fewer than half of families routinely eat together.

Experts said that family meals tend to be healthier than those eaten alone.  Parents that eat with their children may also have more time to spend with them in general.

Norwegian researchers collected information on the eating habits of almost 8,000 boys and girls from eight countries across Europe.

The youngsters, who were aged between ten and 12, were also weighed and measured.

The results showed that children who ate breakfast with at least one parent at least five times a week were 40 per cent less likely to be overweight than others.

Family breakfasts cut the odds of being overweight by 30 per cent, the European Congress on Obesity in Sofia, Bulgaria heard.

Surprisingly, family lunches had the opposite effect.

However, the researchers, from the University of Agder in Norway, said this may be a rogue result caused by the many different lunching practices across Europe muddying the picture

For instance, Norwegian schools don’t have canteens, so children take their food in with them, while youngsters in Greece tend to go home for lunch.

Researcher Dr Frøydis Vik said: ‘The results show that having family meals, such as breakfast and dinner may be of importance to a healthy weight status of children.

‘Children and adolescents with obesity have a greater risk of also being obese as adults.

‘And since it is really difficult to lose weight and lose weight on a permanent basis, it is really difficult to prevent becoming overweight in the first place.’

Dr Gavin Sandercock of the University of Essex, said that just 48 per cent of British families regularly eat together.

He said that family meals give parents a control what their child is eating and teach them about the value of good nutrition.

Eating together may also be a sign that parents have time to spend with their children and that they set rules on things like bedtime that benefit health.

Research has also shown that happier families eat together.

Dr Sandercock said: ‘It could be as simple as if you eat together, you have healthier, home-cooked food.’
