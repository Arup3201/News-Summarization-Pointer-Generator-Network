It is any family man's worst nightmare. His two daughters are dead. His wife is in jail charged with their murder. But Jose Humberto Taque, of Los Angeles, said he doesn't want the mother of his girls to go to jail, nor does he blame her for the tragedy.

One week after taking five-year-old Marian off life support, Mr Taque told the LA Times that he wants Lorna Valle to be given psychiatric help for the anxiety she suffers rather than be locked up.

'She felt like she was going to die,' he said. 'Nobody listened to her'. He claimed his wife had been denied the treatment she needed, citing one instance when she waited for eight hours at Los Angeles County-USC Medical Centre but was not seen by a mental health worker.

Mr Tarque's attourney, Luis Carrillo added that he is considering filing a negligence lawsuit against the county. He said: 'She fell into a profound abyss and didn't return, and that ended in the tragedy with the girls.'

Lindsay and Marian’s funeral was held on Wednesday afternoon at Funeraria Latino Americana in East Los Angeles.

They lay in small caskets wearing matching white dresses and flower headbands, with their hair in curls. Their bodies had been sprayed with the scent of baby powder.

Children's lullabies played as Mr Taque approached the caskets. Over and over, he repeated their names as he wept. 'Mi Lindsay, mi Marian.'

Relatives and friends watched a slide 
show of the sisters: dressed as princesses, driving a play car, swimming
in a plastic pool. They will be buried in Guatemala.

Mr Taque said he is still trying to get his head around how Valle could have become so desperate that she killed Marian, five, and her one-year-old sister Lindsay.

‘It's inexplicable," he told the LA Times. ‘I don't understand what happened. She always took care of them.’

On Valentine's Day, Valle bought her daughters stuffed teddy bears and balloons. The next morning she allegedly tried to drown them in an infant tub. 

She was interrupted by Mr Taque who returned to their south Los Angeles home from the grocery store around 7.30am Wednesday morning after going to pick up juice and milk for his daughters.

When he arrived in the house, neighbours heard screams of ‘My babies! My babies!’ and police were called.Officers found the scene so distressing that the first responders have been offered counselling to help deal with what they saw.

Lindsay was declared dead at the scene. 
Marian died last week when Mr Taque made the heart-wrenching decision to turn off her 
life-support machine. He said he had 'made a humanitarian decision to donate
my daughter’s organs so another person can live.’

Valle, was charged with their murder and is being held on $1.5million bail. If convicted, she could get 50 years to life in prison.

Valle and Mr Tarque met and fell in love in Guatamala as teenagers. The family emigrated to California about ten years ago where Valle worked in a perfume shop and Mr Taque as a gardener. Neighbours described them as hard working and friendly.

Now questions are being raised about Lorna Valle’s mental state, and some say that she had appeared depressed in recent weeks.

Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health spokeswoman Kathleen Piche told the LA Times the incident was ‘a great tragedy’  but said there was no record of Valle seeking services from the county mental health department.

Deputy Public Defender Shelan Joseph, who is representing Valle, said she is looking into whether Valle suffers from mental illness and what services she has received. 'My heart goes out to the family,' she said.
