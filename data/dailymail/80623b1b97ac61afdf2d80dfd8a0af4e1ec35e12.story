Celtic striker Anthony Stokes is a £1.5million transfer target for Championship club Cardiff City.

The Republic of Ireland striker scored the Parkhead club’s winning goal in Saturday’s 1-0 victory over Motherwell — his seventh strike of the season.

A first-choice pick under Ronny Deila on the left wing, the 26-year-old signed a new three-year deal back in October 2013.

Struggling for goals and creativity, however, Cardiff are interested in luring Stokes back to English league football, where he started his career with Arsenal and spent three seasons at Sunderland.

Ninth in the English Championship and two points off the play-off places, the Welsh club want to bolster their promotion hopes with new attacking options in next month’s transfer window.

‘If we can add a couple to the group, things will be a lot better,’ admitted City manager Russell Slade before Saturday’s 0-0 draw with Rotherham.

‘We’re going in the right direction — but I think there’s lots of work still to be done and a lot of improvement still to come from the group that we’ve got.’

Stokes has secured three league title medals and two Scottish Cup medals, scoring 73 goals in 151 domestic appearances and two goals in Europe. He could be one of a number of January departures from Celtic, with Kris Commons, Leigh Griffiths and Beram Kayal also assessing their options.

Meanwhile, Stokes has heaped praise on Celtic’s defence following their performance against Motherwell in the weekend’s victory.

Most of the post-match attention focused on the champions’ attacking play but the Irishman was keen to highlight the contribution of the backline, particularly Efe Ambrose, who has returned to the side in recent weeks following Jason Denayer’s injury.

‘Efe has come in and done very well,’ Stokes told the club’s website. ‘Obviously Jason has a niggle at the minute but we have that quality in the squad — if someone is injured or is lacking form, someone can step in and take their place — and Efe has been outstanding.

‘They have been doing very well. We have been strong at the back and Craig Gordon has been immense since coming in. ‘We have momentum at the minute, winning games and we’re keeping clean sheets as well.’

Celtic’s win over the Steelmen was their seventh successive league victory and Stokes insists they are determined to continue their form over the rest of the festive period. We always go out with the mentality of trying to win every game,’ he said. ‘Confidence is high at the minute and momentum is good and we will try to take our chances.

‘We haven’t set a target. We just want to pick up three points in every game. We are on a good run at the minute and we want to maintain that.’
