Jonny Wilkinson says Owen Farrell is the man into take England into next year’s World Cup in the pivotal fly-half position.

Saracens No10 Farrell, sidelined with a leg injury but expected to be fit ‘within a fortnight’ according to club coach Mark McCall, faces stiff competition for his international place from Bath’s George Ford, Sale’s Danny Cipriani and Leicester’s Freddie Burns.

But World Cup winner Wilkinson, who retired last season, insists that with 25 caps and 271 points already to his name, 23-year-old Farrell is the man for the job.

‘Owen Farrell has done his bit, he’s served his time and done his work; he’s shown that he’s the guy in charge of the shirt,’ said Wilkinson.

‘You can’t say he’s really put a foot wrong. He’s a young guy who’s taken on huge amounts of responsibility and is happy to put his neck on the line in a sport that can be fairly ruthless. 

'A young guy who’s willing to do that and has already shown he’s very capable of doing it is a bit of Godsend — you don’t want to throw that away, believe me.’

Cipriani, who faces former club Wasps in the Aviva Premiership on Sunday, has been in outstanding form this season after forcing his way back into the England reckoning on their summer tour to New Zealand.

‘Danny Cipriani is a great talent,’ said Wilkinson. ‘Everybody knows he’s got the ability and mentally he’s probably as strong as he’s ever been.’ 

Wilkinson was speaking at a World Cup event at his former club Newcastle, who host Exeter in the Aviva Premiership on Sunday.
