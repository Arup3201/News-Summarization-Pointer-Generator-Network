PSG v Brest: All the action as it happens tonight with Dan Ripley from 7pm here

David Beckham will bring the curtain down on his glittering carer TONIGHT after Paris Saint-German's final home game of the season against Brest.

The former Manchester United and Real Madrid superstar, 38, announced his retirement from the game on Thursday - as revealed by Sportsmail.

It was thought initially that Beckham would bow out next weekend in PSG's final game of the season at Lorient. But sources close to the superstar have confirmed that this evening's game in the French capital will in fact be his last.

And here, we can reveal the final pair of boots that the former England captain will hang up.

Last outing: Beckham will wear these boots for the clash against Brest on Saturday night

To celebrate the special occasion, 
Beckham's family made their way to Paris earlier today to join him at the Parc des Princes and see him
start for Carlo Ancelotti's Ligue 1 champions.

It is also understood that Beckham will captain PSG tonight as his wife Victoria and children were spotted arriving at London's St. Pancras International Station ready to catch the Eurostar service.

Beckham's proud sister Joanne tweeted today: 'The emotions are flying around already... Wow.'

Every aspect of the new Predator Lethal Zone boots, meanwhile, were personalised by Beckham on the www.miadidas.com website, proudly paying homage to his kids and nationality. 

Still smiling: Fortunately, adorable baby Harper seemed to have no idea of how bittersweet the occasion would be, and was grinning from ear-to-ear as she sat happily in her big brother's Brooklyn's arms

Emotions running high! Even Romeo, 10, and Cruz,
eight, seemed glum at the prospect of seeing their superstar dad on the
pitch for the last time as they made their way into London's St. 
Pancras International Station

Beckham, capped 115 times for England and the man who helped London secure the 2012 Olympics, chose the red, white and blue colours to represent the Union Jack, with the flag embossed on the heel.

The boots also feature the names of his four children - Romeo, Brooklyn, Cruz and Harper as well as the shirt numbers from his playing career: 7, 23 and 32.

Commenting on his boots, Beckham said: 'This is truly a special moment for me and I'm happy that my longest serving partner, adidas was able to work with me to commemorate the moment. 

'What I really wanted to come across was the passion I had playing for my country and the pride that gave me.' 

Customised: The boots feature Becks' children's names and the numbers from his shirts over the years

Beckham has been been wearing adidas boots since 1996 - the year he scored THAT goal from the halfway-line against Wimbledon for Manchester United.

PSG offered him a one-year contract extension but Beckham - worth an incredible £165million - turned it down, opting to bow out as the first Briton to win four league titles in as many different countries.

Beckham will lift the Ligu 1 title tonight too as PSG celebrate their first championship in 19 years with the former Real Madrid, AC Milan and LA Galaxy star taking part in a lap of honour.

'Special moment': Beckham thanked sponsors adidas for his final boots

He said: 'I'm thankful to PSG for giving me the opportunity to continue but I feel now is the right time to finish my career, playing at the highest level.

'If you had told me as a young boy I would have played for and won trophies with my boyhood club Manchester United, proudly captained and played for my country over one hundred times and lined up for some of the biggest clubs in the world, I would have told you it was a fantasy. I'm fortunate to have realized those dreams.'

Born winner: France is the fourth country in which Beckham has won the title - a record for a British player

He continued: 'To this day, one of my proudest achievements is captaining my country.

'I knew every time I wore the Three 
Lions shirt, I was not only following in a long line of great players, I
was also representing every fan that cared passionately about their 
country.

'I'm honoured to represent England 
both on and off the pitch ... I want to thank all my team-mates, the 
great managers that I had the pleasure of learning from.

'I also want to thank the fans who have all supported me and given me the strength to succeed.'

The trailblazing midfielder -  who also played AC Milan and Los Angeles Galaxy - is now set to continue his ambassadorial duties with a variety of organisations, which include Sky Sports, adidas, Unicef and promoting football in China.

He said: 'Nothing will ever completely replace playing the game I love, however I feel like I'm starting a new adventure and I'm genuinely excited about what lies ahead.

'I'm fortunate to have been given many opportunities throughout my career and now I feel it's my time to give back.'

Having relocated from LA in January, Beckham is expected to set up a permanent base in London with his family.
