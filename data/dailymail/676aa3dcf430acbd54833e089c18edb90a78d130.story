Emergency services are urging Britons to take care in the scorching hot weather after receiving more 999 calls yesterday than on New Year's Eve.

West Midlands Ambulance Service received 3,211 
emergency calls yesterday, almost 400 more 999 calls than on New 
Year's Eve in 2012.

Emergency service staff say misdemeanours in the hot sun are to blame for the
excess of calls and have warned against the 
dangers of sunstroke and burns, BBQ accidents, dehydration and swimming 
related dangers, as the UK enjoys a heatwave.

It comes after a boy lost his life swimming in  a lake at an old quarry to try and cool off in the scorching 30C heat yesterday.

Hidden dangers: A boy has died after going for a swim in Gullet Quarry, near Upper Colwall, Herefordshire, to cool off in the blazing heat yesterday

The boy, who has not been named, was pulled from Gullet Quarry, near Upper Colwall, Herefordshire, nearly four 
hours after he had failed to resurface at around 1pm.

Emergency services including specialist diving teams rushed to the scene after reports the boy had disappeared.

Paramedics
along with a Hazardous Area Response Team (HART), an air ambulance, 
Hereford and Worcester Fire Service and a diving team from South Wales 
Police, joined the hunt for the boy.

He was eventually located at around 4.50pm following the 'comprehensive' search. Medics attempted to resuscitate him, but despite their efforts the boy died.

Today a young man was hospitalised after tombstoning off a pier at a packed beach.

The man dived into shallow water off the beach at Boscombe, Bournemouth and struck his head on the bottom, suffering head and back injuries.

He had to be airlifted from the scene and was taken to Poole Hospital, where he is believed to be in a stable condition.

Ignoring the warnings: There were more swimmers out in the Quarry lake today despite someone having died less than 24 hours before

Warning signs: There are numerous signs around the quarry warning of the dangers of swimming in the water which still contains old equipment

Following the death of the boy yesterday, police have issued a warning against swimming in the dangerous bodies of water. However, they are not treating the incident as suspicious.

A woman who lives locally, but did not want to be named, said this was not the first death a the quarry.

She said: 'My partner called me and said it was all cordoned off because a lad had died.

'There are signs up all around saying don't swim or dive, and that people have been killed in the last few years here.

'Under the water there's the old machinery still down there.

'But kids still thrown themselves off the cliffs into the water, and that water is freezing cold.'

Another
resident, Bill Frankly, 68, said: 'That quarry must be 100ft deep in 
the middle. When they left they left a crane in there and I think it's 
still stood upright in the water hidden from view.

'In
the past a lad who jumped off the cliff hit the side and broke his back
as he went down. It's dangerous to try and swim or dive.'

Heatwave: Emergency services received more 999 calls yesterday than on New Year's Eve as temperature across the country, including Torkington Park in Stockport, pictured, soared to close to 30C

The
quarry, that sits in the picturesque Malvern Hills, carries a warning 
sign written by Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue Service stating:Â  'There have been three fatalities from downing in the last six years and
multiple serious injuries from swimming in these waters.'

A
West Midlands Ambulance Service spokeswoman said: 'Crews arrived on 
scene to be told a teenage boy had failed to resurface after swimming in
the lake.

'Ambulance staff 
split up to search the edges of the lake. The Trust's HART paramedics 
teamed up with Hereford and Worcester Search and Rescue and a diving 
team from South Wales Police to undertake an extensive water search.

'Sadly,
after a comprehensive search, the teenager was found at about 4.50pm. 
It quickly became apparent to crews that nothing could be done to save 
the boy and he was confirmed dead at the scene.

'This is a tragic case and our thoughts are with the boy's family at this difficult time.

'The
emergency services attend cases such as this all too often and we would
urge members of the public to heed our warnings about swimming in 
rivers, lakes and quarries as it is extremely dangerous and can end in 
tragedy.'

Detective 
Inspector Richard Rees, from West Mercia Police, said: 'This appears to 
have been a tragic accident and our thoughts are with the boy's family 
and friends at this sad time.

'While
it is too early to give a cause of death, we would like to take this 
opportunity to remind people about the dangers of open water.

'With
the warm weather upon us and the school holidays approaching, we would 
advise people to think twice about going into local rivers, lakes and 
canals in order to cool off.

'We
are privileged to live and work in a beautiful part of the country with
a huge area of water.

'However, this comes with its dangers and we would
appeal for people to recognise the risks associated with water and act 
responsibly.'

Meanwhile, a 50-year-old diver has died at a 300ft deep quarry 'pool of death' in Snowdonia - the scene of numerous previous tragedies.

He was at the Dorothea Quarry in the Nantlle Valley, a popular spot for amateur divers, yesterday.

An air ambulance helicopter and RAF rescue helicopter from Valley, Anglesey, flew to the scene after emergency services were informed that he was in cardiac arrest but the man died despite efforts to save him.

Police said that the coroner had been informed. Mining stopped at the site in the early 1970s. More than 20 divers have died there.

As the heat-wave continues, fire chiefs issued an urgent 'barbeque' warning today after a man was badly burned when he poured petrol onto an outdoor cooking stove.

The 42-year-old from Rayleigh, Essex, was treated by paramedics for burns to his arms and hands, but Essex Fire and Rescue Service said the incident could have been much more serious and in a top ten barbeque safety tips, warned people never to use an accelerant with a barbeque.
