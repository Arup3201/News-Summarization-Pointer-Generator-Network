Three Downing Street police officers arrested on suspicion of swapping extreme pornography on their mobile phones will not face criminal charges, Scotland Yard said.

The constables, who remain under internal investigation, are from the Metropolitan Police's SO6 Diplomatic Protection Group, the unit at the centre of the Plebgate scandal which led to the resignation of chief whip Andrew Mitchell.

The images were discovered during the exhaustive £250,000 internal investigation into the controversial affair, known as Operation Alice.

They were arrested on 
December 19 and taken to a Central London police station to be 
questioned. Search warrants executed at their homes.

A
 decision has yet to be made by the CPS regarding criminal charges 
against a fourth officer who was later interviewed about the images, 
which were of an 'extreme sexual nature', but do not involve children.

Every
 officer in the diplomatic protection group, which is responsible for 
securing Downing Street and other diplomatic addresses, was questioned.

Probe: The pornography came to light during the investigation into the 'Plebgate' controversy

It
 is understood the images were found during forensic analysis of 
mobile phones.

A spokesman 
said yesterday: 'Three officers have been informed there will be no further 
action regarding criminal matters but they remain subject to a 
misconduct investigation.'

One of the four officers was suspended and three put on restricted duties after the investigation was launched.

Current
 members of the Government along with former prime ministers and some 
former government ministers are among those who would also be protected 
by the DPG.

The DPG is also
 responsible for the protection of sensitive sites such as embassies and
 missions along with the residential protection for visiting heads of 
state, heads of government and foreign ministers.

It is also involved in surveillance at events which have been identified as high risk and at diplomatic functions or key sites.

These officers also provide specialist counterterrorism searches at sensitive addresses, major events and crime scenes. They also give professional security advice to the diplomatic and government communities.

The
 revelations pile fresh embarrassment on the force, just days after 
another officer from the unit was jailed for 12 months for lying over 
Plebgate.

Keith Wallis, 53,
 falsely claimed to have witnessed the clash between Mr Mitchell, then 
The Tory chief whip, and a colleague who was on duty at the Downing 
Street gates.

Commissioner 
Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe apologised to the senior politician, and the 
public, this week saying officers must uphold the highest standards of 
integrity.

He added: ‘Where officers break the law they must expect to 
be held to account and answer for what they have done.’
