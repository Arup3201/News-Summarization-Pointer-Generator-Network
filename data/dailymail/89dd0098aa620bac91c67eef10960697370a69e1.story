David Beckham has taken a trip down memory lane by posting a picture of himself with his son Brooklyn during his playing days at Manchester United.

The former Manchester United and Real Madrid midfielder took to Facebook to wish his eldest son happy birthday. 

Proud father Beckham, 39, marked his oldest son's 16th birthday with a black and white snap that sees him nestling lovingly into Brooklyn's hair with the message: 'Happy Birthday to my big boy.'

The former footballer shared a rare insight into the private family album on Wednesday as he celebrated his eldest child's big day with a photo post to Facebook. 

Beckham, who also has children Romeo, 12, Cruz, 10, and three-year-old Harper with wife Victoria, 40, played the embarrassing dad card when he also pulled out a toddler snap from the collection.

The picture shows Beckham in his full Manchester United kit after winning the Premier League in 2000.

Beckham brought his son onto the pitch and held his hand as the toddler marched around Old Trafford wearing daddy's medal. 

Already following his father's flair for fashion, Brooklyn boasted about a special gift from rapper and fashion entrepreneur Kanye West on Wednesday.

Brooklyn woke up to a fresh pair of stylish beige trainers, which he thanked the artist for on Instagram.

He said: 'Thanks Kanye for the Yeezys' and captured the box fresh gift for his 361k social media followers.

It's been a big couple of weeks for the sweet 16-year-old, who has been dealing with the disappointment of not being dealt a professional contract with Arsenal football club after playing for their youth team.

Though his luck might be turning around as it was revealed on Wednesday that Manchester United are keen to snap up the teenager.

Meanwhile, Amir Khan's wife Faryal Makhdoom has taken to Instagram to send an affectionate message to her husband and daughter Lamaisah.
