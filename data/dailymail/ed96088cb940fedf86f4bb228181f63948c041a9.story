This saga’s gone on longer than The Mousetrap. And let’s be honest — it’s not been handled brilliantly by the ECB.

But you can hardly blame Kevin Pietersen for wanting to throw his lot in with Surrey and score some first-class runs.

His interpretation of what Colin Graves said about playing in the domestic game has given him a lifeline. Now it’s up to Pietersen to use it.

With Graves and Tom Harrison coming in as ECB chairman and chief executive respectively, it’s reasonable to work on the basis that everyone starts with a clean slate.

They could well be leaning on Paul Downton, the managing director, with this basic point: the best players get picked. That’s how it works in other sports, so why not in cricket?

Pietersen will have a great chance to excel in Division Two at an excellent club. He’s also fit enough, even in his mid-30s. He leads a good lifestyle and he’ll be desperate to bang the door down.

It’s all set up for him.

Pietersen still wants to add to his 23 Test centuries despite being axed by England last year

People are worried about his book, but the main targets in those pages — Andy Flower and Matt Prior — are no longer in the England set-up. I thought the book was a sad read, to learn that he wasn’t enjoying what should have been among the best moments of his life. That’s a real shame.

But if Pietersen scores so many runs for Surrey that Graves and Harrison think he’s irresistible, then everyone will just have to sit down and talk things through.

Yes, it would become tricky for Downton and Peter Moores, who Pietersen didn’t rate highly in his first stint as England coach. But I’d put the key players in this drama in one room and tell them not to reappear until they’ve bashed out a compromise. Treat it like a jury: don’t emerge until you’ve got a majority decision.

Pietersen is the best batsman I’ve seen for England and if he can get his mojo back playing for Surrey then at least he’ll have fulfilled the criterion that Graves laid down.

Test cricket is what gets Pietersen’s juices flowing. It’s unrealistic to imagine he could still be around for the 2019 World Cup. But he’s found himself a county and now he’s got to get some runs.

It’s going to be a very interesting summer.
