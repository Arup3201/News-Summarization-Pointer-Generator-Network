Malaria that is completely resistant to drug treatment could soon spread into India putting millions of lives at risk, scientists have warned. 

Experts have discovered a strain of the parasite in Burma that is totally resistant to the antimalarial drug artemisinin, which they have described as an 'enormous threat'.

Worryingly, the resistant parasites have been found just 15 miles from the country's border with India in an 'alarming development'.

If the spread of artemisinin-resistant malaria parasites were to reach into India, that would pose a serious threat to the chances of global control of the killer disease. 

Philippe Guerin, director of the Worldwide Antimalarial Resistance Network, said: 'The pace at which artemisinin resistance is spreading or emerging is alarming.' 

'We need a more vigorous international effort to address this issue in border regions.'  

In a study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases
journal, experts collected 940 parasite samples at 55
malaria treatment centres across Burma - also known as Myanmar - and its border regions.

Similar strains have also been detected in Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam and Laos. 

They found that almost 40 percent of the samples had mutations
in their so-called kelch gene, K13 -- a known genetic signal of
artemisinin drug resistance.

Charles Woodrow of the Mahidol-Oxford tropical medicine research unit led the study at Oxford University, said: 'Myanmar is considered the front line in the battle against artemisinin resistance as it forms a gateway for resistance to spread to the rest of the world.'

If resistance spreads from Asia to Africa, or emerges in
Africa independently, 'millions of lives
will be at risk', the report said.

Deaths from malaria have nearly halved since 2000, and the infection now kills an estimated 600,000 people each year - most of them children in the poorest parts of sub-Saharan Africa.

Woodrow noted that thanks to advances in the science of
genetic analysis, researchers tracking artemisinin antimalarials
are in 'the unusual position of having molecular markers for
resistance before resistance has spread globally'.

He added: 'The more we understand about the current situation...the
better prepared we are to adapt and implement strategies to
overcome the spread of further drug resistance.'

From the late 1950s to the 1970s, chloroquine-resistant malaria spread across Asia to Africa, leading to a resurgence of cases and millions of deaths.

Chloroquine was replaced by sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP), but resistance to SP subsequently emerged in western Cambodia and again spread to Africa. SP was replaced by artemisinin combination treatment, or ACT, and experts now worry that history may repeat itself yet again.
