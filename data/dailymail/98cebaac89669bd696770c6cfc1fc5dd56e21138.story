It’s the London borough that is home to TV’s
favourite young socialites and a hot-bed of love rifts, Moet-fuelled pardies
and awkward silences.

And now, to celebrate the launch of the new Made In Chelsea Life
and Style Essentials book, the hottest members of the cast have shared their exclusive fashion, beauty
and life essentials with FEMAIL.

First up is everyone’s favourite nostril flaring friend, Andy
Jordan. Whilst his humble nostrils may be more famous than he is (they have their
own Twitter account with 12,000 followers), Andy still prides himself as being quite
the SW1 lothario.

They're back! Made In Chelsea is back on our screens so FEMAIL roped in a few cast members to share their life and style essentials

The 24-year-old, who called time on his relationship with co-star
Louise Thompson in Monday’s episode, has revealed exactly what he looks for in a
woman (single ladies, listen up).

‘My three top style essentials for women are: never show too much
chest, I prefer high neck tops.

‘Tight trousers with heels are perfect for a night out and never
wear too much make-up. Natural girls are so much more attractive. It is so
important to be confident in yourself.’

Andy, who is a City trader by day and ladies’ man by night, cites
Rosie Fortescue as the most stylish girl on the show.

Things can only get better: Andy, who ended his relationship 
with Louise (L) on last night's show, said things will be looking more 
positive for him as the season progresses

‘She really makes a lot of effort with her style. I would also say
that Proudlock is the most stylish because he takes risks but sometimes he
takes the trends too far,’ said Andy.

Sloaney Andy said that if he had to pick one co-star to give a
makeover to, it would be his best friend Stevie Johnson.

‘As much as I love Stevie, I want to rough him up. He needs to
experiment more with his style. I would dress him in ripped jeans, mess up his
hair and I think he would really enjoy it.

Here come the girls: Cheska Hull (L) doesn't consider herself to be very stylish and Fran Newman-Young (R) revealed that she helped hone Jessie J's career

‘We are going to see a real bad-ass side to Stevie this season.
Did I influence him? Well, I am a total bad-ass myself,’ said Andy.

Whilst the brunette prides himself on his bad boy reputation, Andy
has shown a more emotional and sensitive side so far this series.

‘I didn’t enjoy filming the first few episodes but that’s life,
there are highs and lows. But trust me, there will be some highs
for me this season,’ he revealed.

Andy is already seeing some career highlights. He has just
released his new single, Whole Lot of Water, and called on co-star Cheska Hull
to do the PR for it.

‘I love singing, but it’s a hobby. I could never be a pop star
because I get scared on stage but I would love to do some gigs in pubs around
the country,’ he said.

Speaking about the surprising new partnership, Cheska said: ‘This
season you’ll see a different side to me, more of a business side.

‘I am helping Andy with his music career; people have no idea that
we are friends. Ollie has left the show and I don’t think people realise that I
do actually have other friends.

‘I am so grateful for the show for also bringing Fran into my life, we
are best friends,’ she gushed.

Speaking about her personal style, Cheska said she loves to dress
up in anything girly, fluffy and glittery but admits she doesn’t think she’s
the ‘most stylish’ on the show, citing Fran as her biggest style inspiration.

Fran Newman-Young, who has been at the centre of recent MIC drama after hooking
up with her best friend Phoebe’s ex-boyfriend, said it has been a ‘complicated’
season so far.

‘Over the summer, mine and Alex’s relationship has changed. I
don’t like fighting with Phoebe but you can’t help who you fall for,’ she said.

Whilst she may come across as a home wrecker on the show, Fran is
keen to prove that she has a lot more to offer.

As a freelance music consultant who has worked with Sony,
Fran helped hone the careers of Jessie J and Naughty Boy.

But for now, TV’s favourite rahs are busy causing drama on E4 and
promoting their latest tome.

The new handbook sees Lucy get up in our grill, Mark Francis
and Victoria reveal their fashionista dos and don'ts and Binky's mum provide the voice of reason.

Welcome to Chelsea, darling.
