On the fourth day of Berlin fashion week - which has so far offered sophisticated retro looks and daring transparent bridal wear - French-Austrian designer Marina Hoermanseder showcased her quirky medical-inspired Autumn/Winter 13/14 collection.

Crotchless trousers, corsets and chokers in shades of nude and taupe were belted tightly around loose jumpers and dresses, resembling surgical supports or restraining garments.

Twisted patent leather belts featured on almost every look, reflecting the unhinged inspiration behind her collection. It's no surprise Lady Gaga has reportedly requested some pieces.

A bright young Central St. Martins College graduate and an Alexander McQueen intern last summer, Hoermanseder wasn't afraid to push boundaries.

Other looks from her collection included a waspie with a 
strap attached toÂ  a model's neck, fastened over a fluffy long-sleeved 
mini skirt, as well as transparent tailored dress cinched in by a flesh-coloured belted corset with shoulder straps, resembling armour.

'I want to stir up the fashion industry with my creations but also earn respect as I pour my heart and soul into my work,' she says.

She says bodies, extremities and prostheses are her inspiration.

Hoermanseder describes herself as a handcrafter, who is sleepless until her pieces are finished. In her latest offering, the parallels to her role model McQueen are clear.

'He developed his first drafts during sleepless nights in a garage in East London. I often think about that when I am colouring thousand metres of leather edges in my kitchen.'

Last season's collection was very similar.

'I
 wanted to design a collection that gave women support, that literally 
helped them stand taller, stronger. Many of my leather pieces are fully 
studded, I also moulded the corsets by wetting and twisting the leather 
to accentuate the spine curvatures,' she told a website at the time.

Meanwhile, Miranda Konstantinidou presented her collection full of colourfully weaved dresses and bug-eyed glasses.

The designer is constantly developing new production techniques by combining traditional and modern assembly methods and experimenting with unusual combinations of materials.

This season, she opted for statement jewellery and woven headscarves to complement her eclectic, almost tribal range.

Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week - a week long industry event showcasing the creations by designers and fashion houses - runs in Berlin from January 14-17.
