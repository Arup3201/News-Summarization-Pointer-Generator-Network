A man who was banned from seeing his fiancée after he was charged with assaulting her has had it lifted - so they can get married.

Kevin Campbell  was ordered to stay away from Lynsey McGarrigle, 30, as part of his  bail conditions following the allegations of assault and threatening behaviour.

But the court agreed to lift the order just in time for the big day and the couple tied the knot in Greenock, Inverclyde earlier this week.

Sheriff Ian Fleming agreed to waive the ban, with a warning to Campbell to 'behave' after hearing the couple were desperate to see each other.

Drug addict Campbell, who describes himself as ‘self employed' on his Facebook page, told the Daily Record he was 'over the moon' to finally marry his girlfriend who describes herself as a ‘full time lazy b****.'

'I got the conditions lifted so we could get married. I'm very happy,' added the 36-year-old who said the couple were now hoping to honeymoon in Spain. 

But he did complain the bail conditions were 'too much.'

'The sheriff hasn't been good to me at all,' he added.

The couple began dating in March this year. But in May, Campbell, who is on a high-dose methadone programme, was arrested for the alleged attack on her.

Campbell was charged with threatening Lynsey and pushing her onto a sofa before punching her repeatedly in a row at her flat.

He is due to stand trial on the charges of assaulting and threatening her in March. Campbell denies both charges.

Despite the allegations, the couple had been unable to keep apart and police found him at her flat on two occasions - once hiding under a mattress.

He was sentenced to 12 months' community supervision and 70 hours' unpaid work for the breaches.

Since breaching the order, Campbell last week requested his bail conditions to be relaxed to allow him to marry.

Prosecutor Pamela Brady said: 'The Crown doesn't wish to be standing in the way of a marriage but it is somewhat difficult given the nature of the charges. 'There is a difficult balance to be struck.

'The court can clearly see the nature of the charges.'

Lifting the ban, Sheriff Fleming said: 'Yes, but I understand the court has imposed a bail condition that the complainer doesn't want.'
