Seven men sought by police investigating racist chanting at a mainline station following a Chelsea Champions League football match earlier this month have all been identified, police said.

Britsh Transport Police (BTP) said they would be interviewed in due course.

BTP had released images of seven men taken at St Pancras International station in London at around 8pm on February 18.

The British Transport Police released images of seven men, believed to be Chelsea supporters, who arrived back in St Pancras Station following their return from Paris after last week's Champions League footage

Officers confirmed they had identified seven men in the CCTV footage and will interview them 'in due course' 

Passengers travelling through the station complained over the allegedly racist chants as Chelsea fans returned to London following their Champions League match against Paris St Germain. 

It is the second investigation into allegedly racist chanting involving Chelsea fans attending the same game.  

This was the day after an incident on the Paris Metro before Chelsea's match with Paris St Germain when a man was subjected to alleged racist abuse.

In a statement today, solicitor John Kaye, who has been engaged by Chelsea fan Jamie Fairbairn, 23, said his client had accepted being among those in the carriage of the Metro train in Paris during the incident involving a black man, Souleymane Sylla, on the evening of February 17.

He added that Mr Fairbairn denies preventing Mr Sylla from boarding or using words of a racist or threatening nature, and also denies saying anything of a racist nature during his visit to Paris or later at St Pancras.

He said Mr Fairbairn was not even present during the alleged racist chanting incident at St Pancras.

The solicitor added that media interest in the story had forced Mr Fairbairn to move away from his home and he had been suspended from work.

'On behalf of Mr Fairbairn, I have been in contact with the Metropolitan Police to offer Mr Fairbairn's assistance as a witness,' Mr Kaye said.
