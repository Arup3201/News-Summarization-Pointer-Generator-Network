Nicola Hicks, 42, was told she wasn't allowed to buy more than three packs of steak from her local Morrisons supermarket in Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire

A mother who wanted to buy four packets of steak for a family dinner was told she was only allowed buy three by a supermarket cashier.

Nicola Hicks, 42, of Great Amwell, Hertfordshire, was astonished when the woman on the checkout at her local Morrisons in Hoddesdon held back one of the packets and called over her supervisor.

The supervisor agreed that four packets was too many, and only allowed Mrs Hicks to buy three packets.

When Mrs Hicks' mother-in-law, who was with her, tried to buy one pack separately, she was refused.

Mrs Hicks, a mother of three, said that at first, she didn't understand why the cashier would only scan three of the two-packs of steak.

She said: 'The lady on the till scanned three and then said she had to call the supervisor.  I had no idea why, and asked if there was a problem.

'She said "I can't let you buy this last packet", and when she called her supervisor over, she agreed.

'I said "Why on earth not - it's not alcohol, it's not medicine, it's only steak", but they just refused, saying there wouldn't be enough left for anyone else.

'I just couldn't believe what was happening - there was plenty left behind on the shelves, and no signs saying that it was on special offer so you could only buy a few.

'Everyone in the queue behind me was absolutely gobsmacked.'

Mrs Hicks, who works in pharmaceuticals sales, argued her case with supermarket staff for quarter of an hour before realising she was not going to win.

As she left, another customer offered to buy the steak for her surreptitiously.

Mrs Hicks said: 'That was the only way I could buy enough meat to feed my family - giving another customer some money and getting them to buy the steak for me.

'I found it disgusting that it's a local store and I couldn't buy enough meat for a family Sunday dinner.'She wanted to buy four packs of two steaks to feed herself, her husband, her three children and her parents on Sunday night.

Steak: The mother of three said she felt 'humiliated' by her encounter with two members of staff at Morrisons

A Morrisons spokesman blamed the problem on computer error, but Mrs Hicks says no-one has contacted her

A spokesman for Morrisons said the meat had been on special offer the day before, which meant sales were limited.

They said: 'We are very sorry that Mrs Hicks was unable to purchase the steak she wanted.

'There had been a system fault on our part that meant that the products couldn’t be processed through the till. 

'We are very keen to work with her to make sure that she is still happy to shop with us in the future.'

But Mrs Hicks said: 'I was humiliated when I was in the right.  I wasn't trying to buy alcohol or pills, just steak.

'They say it was computer error but if that were the case, they would have allowed my mother-in-law to buy the steak.  And to make matters worse, I still haven't heard a thing from Morrisons.'
