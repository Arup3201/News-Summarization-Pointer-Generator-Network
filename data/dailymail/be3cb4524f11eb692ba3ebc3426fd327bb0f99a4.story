Wind farms could be the key to stopping hurricanes devastating the US and costing billions of dollars of damage, researchers have claimed.

A team at Stanford simulated three of the biggest hurricanes ever to hit the US - Sandy, Isaac and Katrina - and found turbines at at sea could dramatically reduce the amount of damage they caused.

They found turbines reduced peak wind speeds by up to 92 mph, and storm surges by up to 79%.

The ultimate hurrican defence? A team at Stanford simulated three of the biggest hurricanes ever to hit the US - Sandy, Isaac and Katrina - and found turbines at at sea could dramatically reduce the amount of damage they caused

Jacobson's model revealed that an array of 78,000 wind turbines off the coast of New Orleans would have significantly weakened the hurricane well before it made landfall.

The turbines slow the outer winds, which decreases wave height and reduces movement of air toward the center of the hurricane.

This increases the central pressure, which in turn slows the winds of the entire hurricane and dissipates it faster.

In the computer model, by the time Hurricane Katrina reached land, its simulated wind speeds had decreased by 36-44 meters per second (between 80 and 98 mph) and the storm surge had decreased by up to 79 percent.

Computer simulations by Professor Mark Jacobson showed the offshore farms could prevent billions of dollars in damages.

'We found that when wind turbines are present, they slow down the outer rotation winds of a hurricane,' Jacobson said.

'This feeds back to decrease wave height, which reduces movement of air toward the center of the hurricane, increasing the central pressure, which in turn slows the winds of the entire hurricane and dissipates it faster.'

The study, conducted by Jacobson, and Cristina Archer and Willett Kempton of the University of Delaware, was published online in Nature Climate Change.

Researchers simulated three hurricanes: Sandy and Isaac, which struck New York and New Orleans, respectively, in 2012; and Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005.

In the case of Katrina, Jacobson's model revealed that an array of 78,000 wind turbines off the coast of New Orleans would have significantly weakened the hurricane well before it made landfall.

In the computer model, by the time Hurricane Katrina reached land, its simulated wind speeds had decreased by 36-44 meters per second (between 80 and 98 mph) and the storm surge had decreased by up to 79 percent.

For Hurricane Sandy, the model projected a wind speed reduction by 35-39 meters per second (between 78 and 87 mph) and as much as 34 percent decrease in storm surge.

Jacobson the reduction of hurricane damage cost and electricity production of the scheme could persuade stats to install it.

Hurricane Sandy, for instance, caused roughly $82 billion in damage across three states.

'The turbines will also reduce damage if a hurricane comes through,' Jacobson said.

'These factors, each on their own, reduce the cost to society of offshore turbines and should be sufficient to motivate their development.'
