A cash-strapped council has been attacked for installing expensive bins that cost £5,000 each, provide free wifi and send a text message when they're full.

Ceredigion County Council in west Wales, which must make £9.5million in cuts by 2015, is under fire after setting up five 'Big Belly' solar-powered bins in seaside locations at a time when it is cutting teaching jobs, and has to dig deep even to fund public toilets.

The hi-tech 'compacter' bins use energy from the sun to crush waste put inside it, which its makers claim gives it between six and eight times the capacity of a regular bin.

They are leased from the manufacturers for around £1,000 a year, and have been set up to tackle a litter problem in seaside areas with grant money from the Welsh Government.

Councils in Somerset and London have already trialled the devices.

It has been claimed the bins will save more than three times as much as they cost, but local people have attacked them as a waste of public money that could be better-spent elsewhere.

In Aberaeron, one of the towns which now has a Big Belly, local representatives complained that the money could be better-spent keeping public toilets open.

Councillor Mair Harrison said: 'We have to pay £4,000 to keep our public toilets open yet they are spending £5,000 on a bin.

'I know it is different funding pots but it’s still public money.'

However, according to claims by CSG Asset Management, which distributes the bins in the UK, the bins will in fact the council money by reducing how often collections need to be made.

The devices, which cost £21 per week each to lease, are said to save £77, reduce the number of bin collections needed by more than 70 per cent and scare off vermin.

As the bins do not leave their rubbish exposed to the elements they are also said to cut the number of pests, as well as the problem of overflowing.

The ability of the bins to text and email when they are full is also said to eliminate 'milk-round' stye collections, as collectors will only need to empty the bins when they know they are nearly full.

A Welsh Government spokesman said: 'Bins in coastal towns, especially Aberystwyth, Borth, Aberaeron and New Quay, experience heavy use during the tourist season.

'Much of the litter is fast food litter that is bulky and attracts seagulls and rats. The innovative Big Belly Bins compress the litter using solar power. The bins can hold six to eight times more waste than the average bin.

'The bins also eliminate smells and do not attract vermin. The bin will send an email and text when it has reached 85 per cent capacity.

'This means it can be emptied when needed rather than having to empty bins on a ‘milk-round’ type basis.'

The Council has been under fire recently for implementing spending cuts, including one of £210,000 to school budgets, which will cost five teachers their jobs.

Budget announcements last month revealed that Ceredigion would lose almost £5million in funding. The council's leader said at the time that the cut was 'unprecedented' and would prompt tough choices.

Welsh councils have faced less pressure in the past years to save money than English counterparts, and have kept the ability to hike council tax by as much as 5 per cent a year to make ends meet.

Ceredigion has increased council tax by 3 per cent per year every year since 2011, which has helped it to avoid making the severe cuts seen elsewhere.

But in the Welsh Government's draft budget this year it was made clear that councils would have to make significant savings.

Ceredigion was given a 4.6 per cent cut, roughly £5million. Taking inflation and existing spending plans into account, it will have to make £9.5million of cuts in the next tax year to balance its books.

The change will be even more severe after the rural council's share of central government funding was revised down due to its declining population.

When the cuts were announced, council leader Ellen ap Gwynn said: 'We will have to make some very difficult decisions over the next few months as we try and minimise the impact on the existing services, and we must accept that some services will need to be reduced or even cut.'

The council is still deciding exactly what will be done to make the savings, but it has been suggested that libraries, refuse collection and public toilets will be in the firing line.
