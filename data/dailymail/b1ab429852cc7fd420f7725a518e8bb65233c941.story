Opening up: Paris Jackson took to Twitter again this morning to share her latest feelings and posted a cheery-looking picture of herself

Paris Jackson turned to Twitter again early this morning to share her latest feelings amid her family crisis.

The 14-year-old, who has used to 
social networking site to express her worries and anger in recent days, 
today appeared to seek solace in her late father's lyrics.

Paris, who says she has been cut off 
from her grandmother Katherine for more than a week, tweeted some words 
from Michael Jackson's 1993 song Will You Be There.

Posting a cheery-looking picture of herself, she wrote: 'everyones taking control of me, it seems that the worlds got a role for
me .. im so confused will u show to me you'll be there for me.'

The lyrics appear to sum up how vulnerable Paris is feeling - although she did look happier in a snap she posted shortly afterwards.

Her latest tweet came just hours before her cousin TJ Jackson, 34, was awarded temporary guardianship of her, along with her siblings Prince, 15, and Blanket, 10.

The order was made by a judge in LA today - just as Randy Jackson claimed Katherine is on her way back to California.

Randy told Good Morning America in a 
phone interview that his mother is returning from Arizona - and insisted
she had gone there on her doctor's orders and is now in 'much better 
health'.

Paris made no mention of her grandmother's expected return today.

But last night she did post an 
apologetic message following a series of angry tweets concerning reports
of her grandmother's well-being.

Paris fumed on the micro-blogging website about being blocked from speaking to her legal guardian, Michael's mother, Katherine.

TJ's in, Katherine's out: Katherine Jackson has 
had her guardianship of her three grandchildren suspended while their 
cousin TJ has been awarded temporary custody

But after a flurry of posts - 
including threats to the person responsible for the matriarch's sudden 
departure from their shared Los Angeles home - Paris had seemingly 
calmed and took a more sombre tone last night.

'a lot of ppl have been saying that i "changed", she wrote.

'i wanna apologize for the attitude... there's just a lot going on... i promise: the ego = gone(:'.

Paris earlier in the day promised to 
'make whoever did this pay' after not being able to contact her 
grandmother Katherine for nine days.

The teenager and her two brothers, 
Prince and Prince Michael II, aka Blanket, are wards of the 82-year-old 
Jackson family matriach and normally live with her at a luxury compound 
in Calabasas.

Outspoken: The teenager took to Twitter again last night with this message that appeared to be directed at friends

Anger: Paris Jackson hadn't had any contact with
her grandmother Katherine for nine days as of Tuesday afternoon; Katherine is the guardian of 
the teen and her brothers

But a dispute over their father's $500m will has sparked a family feud, with their grandmother caught in the middle.

Katherine stayed at a spa in Arizona, 
arranged by daughter Janet, after spending a few days with her daughter 
Rebbie and other family members in the state.

But she has not contacted Michael's 
three children during this time, with her son Jermiane admitting in a 
statement that she has been denied access to phones or computers to 
ensure her 'well being'.

After a series of increasingly 
worried and angry tweets about the situation, Paris yesterday wrote: '9 days
and counting… so help me god i will make whoever did this pay.'

Previously she had written: 'something is really off , this isn't like her at all .. i wanna talk 
directly to my grandmother!!< 3.'

Her
cousin TJ Jackson replied: 'I know it's completely unfair for them to 
do this to you and your brothers. We will keep trying. I love you.'

Katherine
was reported missing by nephew Trent Jackson over the weekend, sparking
a welfare check by the state's Pima County Sheriff's Department. She was found to be safe and well with her children.

Family ties: Paris leaned on her grandmother, 
Katherine, while her younger brother, Prince Michael II, holds a 
doll in the image of his father during Michael Jackson's public memorial in Los Angeles in 2009

On Monday, Michael's siblings responded 
to rumours their mother Katherine was missing by publishing a 
photograph of her playing cards.

As
a result of the controversy the executors of Michael Jackson's estate 
are drafting papers to apply for emergency guardianship of his three 
children. TMZ reports they fear the siblings are in danger without their grandmother's supervision.

In a further twist on Monday Jermaine, Randy and Janet Jackson were barred from their mother's 
Calabasas, California home after 
allegedly attempting to remove the children.

A source told website RadarOnline:
'Randy was telling Prince Michael he had to leave with them and that he
had a private jet chartered to take them all to Arizona to see 
Katherine.

'Prince firmly held his ground and told Randy he wasn't going 
anywhere with them.'

Speaking out:  Paris said 'something is off' about the way in which Katherine Jackson 'disappeared'

Call for help: Paris asked her 500,000-plus followers to call authorities if they saw Katherine Jackson before it was revealled the 82-year-old matriarch was in Arizona with daughter Rebbie

On Sunday night, a fretting Paris sent a
concerned tweet about her 'missing' grandmother , saying the matriarch 
had not been in contact in over a week.

'yes , my grandmother is missing . i haven't spoken with her in a week i want her home now .' she wrote, then continuing: 'If anybody sees my grandmother , please call the authorities or this 
number— (818)-876-0186 it's the security number... thank you so much.'

The unusual situation comes after 
Katherine's children, also including Tito, wrote a letter demanding the 
resignations of the executors of Michael's estate because they believe 
his will was a fake.

Siblings: (L-R) Prince Jackson, Paris Jackson 
and Prince Michael II are the only family members 
along with their grandmother named in Michael Jackson's will - an issue 
said to be at the centre of a family feud

The 
letter also alleged that the executors' manipulations left Katherine in 
bad health and caused her to have a mini-stroke which she has denied.

The family is understood to be at war over Michael Jackson's 
estate and sources claim there's a 'concerted effort' by Janet, 
Randy, Tito, Rebbie and Jermaine to get  Katherine on board to challenge
Michael Jackson's will and get the executors removed.

Only Katherine and Michael's three children are named in the will, along
with some money assigned to charity, so the siblings are understood to 
be eager to have it declared invalid to gain access to the $500m 
fortune.

Michael died in 2009 when he overdosed on prescription drug Propofol.

Matriarch: Katherine Jackson, 82, has left Los Angeles to stay with her daughter Rebbie in Arizona for reasons unknown

Mystery: Police were called to the Jackson family home in Calabasas, California on Monday afternoon, after which a battery report was apparently filed

What's at stake:

A
recent financial summary showed that Michael Jackson's estate has 
earned almost $500million in gross profits since his death, and many of 
his major debts have either been resolved or are no longer delinquent.

Key players:

Katherine Jackson

Prince Michael, Paris and Blanket

Janet, Randy, Rebbie and Jermaine Jackson

Tito Jackson

Marlon Jackson

On the fence

Tito Junior, son of Michael's brother Tito

Trent Jackson, Joe Jackson's nephew
