Guilty: Gordon Dyche has been sentenced to four years in prison for causing death by careless driving

A 'chancer' who killed four members of the same family when he shunted their car off the road and into a reservoir while rushing to work was jailed for four years yesterday.

Mechanic Gordon Dyche, 24, had recently completed a driving ban when he tried to overtake two cars in a row on a winding country road because he was worried he would lose pay if he was late.

He passed a Volkswagen Passat which was travelling at 40mph but his Mondeo clipped the back of a people carrier being driven by dedicated foster mother Denise Griffith as she attempted to turn right into  a lay-by to admire the view at a beauty spot.

Her Peugeot 807 careered 20ft down a rocky bank and hit a boulder before somersaulting into the reservoir and sinking 50ft.

Mrs Griffith's husband of 26 years Emyr, 66, a power station worker, her 84-year-old mother Phyllis Hooper and foster sons Peter Briscombe and Liam Govier, both 14, were trapped inside and drowned.

Only Mrs Griffith, 55, and the family dog Milly survived by swimming to safety from Llyn Clywedog Reservoir near Llanidloes, mid Wales.

Dyche, who had a history of minor driving offences, had completed a three month ban for driving without insurance just three weeks before the accident on the B4518 in April last year.

He denied causing the deaths by careless driving but a jury found him guilty. He was cleared of four counts of causing death by dangerous driving.

Judge Niclas Parry told Dyche at Caernarfon Crown Court he had put his own interests above the safety of others.

'You are a chancer behind the wheel,' the judge said. 'You are prepared to put your own interests above the lives of other road users.

Bubbly: The biological mother of victim Liam Govier, 14, described him as a lovely, smiley little chap whose favourite school subject was cookery

'You were late for work. You knew from previous experience the consequences would be docked wages.'

Dyche, of Llanbrynmair, mid Wales, who
is married with a young child, was also handed another six month jail 
term after it emerged he was serving a suspended prison sentence for 
handling stolen goods at the time of the accident. He was also banned 
from driving for four years.

After the verdicts a tearful Mrs 
Griffith, who told the court her life had been 'ruined' by Dyche, said: 
'No words can express how much I miss my family and how much my life has
changed since that day in April 2011.'

She and her husband, from Pontypridd, who were unable to have children of their own, fostered 98 children over 23 years.

Liam's birth mother Alison Govier, 38,
said her son 'was a lovely bubbly boy'. She described Dyche as a menace
who 'should never have been on the road'.

Peter's father Simon Briscombe, 43, of Ely, Cardiff, said: 'We are pleased he's been jailed but it's not long for four lives.'

A
family friend of Denise Griffith, who did not want to be identified, 
said after the verdict that Mrs Griffith could never be compensated for 
her loss.

‘Her life has been ruined. Of course she wanted the person responsible for what happened to be made accountable.

‘But she isn't taking any great comfort in the outcome. At the end of the day, the poor lady has lost her family. ‘

a court hearing at Caernarfon Crown Court. On Tuesday Mrs Griffith 
said: 'I know my life has been ruined. It’s the most lonely, lonely 
place to be.'
