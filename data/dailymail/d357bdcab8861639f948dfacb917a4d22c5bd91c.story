Dementia sufferer Janet Tierney was severely injured after allegedly being attacked by a male resident at their care home

These shocking images show the appalling injuries suffered by a 91-year-old dementia patient after she was allegedly 'kicked like a football' by a violent male resident in her care home.

Widow Janet Tierney has spent almost seven weeks in hospital recovering after she was left badly battered and bruised.

Janet, a retired bus conductor and grandmother-of-two, was allegedly hurt by a fellow dementia patient in his 70s, who attacked her in her room at Bloomfield Court Care Home in Tipton, West Midlands, on September 24.

The home, which specialises in dementia care for residents, is run by Ideal Care Homes.

Both the care home and Sandwell Council, who helped place Mrs Tierney in the residence, say it is unclear what happened to cause the widow's bruises.

Mrs Tierney's daughter Margaret McFerran, 52, from Coleshill, Warwickshire, was called to the care home after the attack.

She
said: 'When I arrived there were a couple of small bruises on her face 
but she burst into tears and was adamant she had been kicked 'like a 
football'.

'With people with
dementia you sometimes wonder if they are not sure whether something 
happened, but she was so stressed I was sure she was right.

'She was taken to hospital and the nurses showed me huge bruises all the way down from her head to her feet.

'I was horrified, I couldn't believe what
I was seeing. She told me there was a man brought into the home who had
kept wandering into her room and scaring her.

'At some point he attacked her. I called social services and they said they would investigate.

'But it’s been seven weeks since the attack now and nothing seems to have been done.

Mrs Tierney was moved to the care home in December last year

'I’m terrified for the safety of my mum and his safety really, they can’t assure me of anything.

'There
is no way she is going back to that home, she’d be terrified. It’s got 
to be against her human rights, she’s stuck in the hospital.'

Sandwell Council say they are working with the widow to find her a new home for her to be cared in.

Mrs McFerran said: 'My mum is a tough woman, but even she is left struggling after this.

'She was in a care home, she should have been safe there of all places.

'It’s an appalling way to treat an elderly woman in her nineties.'

Janet, who was widowed 10 years ago after her husband Patrick lost his battle with cancer, moved to the care home in December last year when she was diagnosed with dementia.

Ideal Care Homes managing director Mark Greaves said he was aware 'of a resident-to-resident altercation involving the lady in question'.

He said: 'The home fully reported [it] to the relevant authorities and is being dealt with within the Safeguarding Procedures of Sandwell Council.

'I understand that the lady has been reassessed by the home’s manager and it has been determined that her needs cannot be met within this setting.'

Yvonne Davies, Sandwell Council cabinet member for adult social care, said it treats 'unfortunate incidents like this extremely seriously'.

She said: 'Staff have spoken on many occasions to both Mrs McFerran and her mother.

'The council’s safeguarding team have been working for some time to find a suitable alternative home that both are happy with and that Mrs Tierney can move to.'

West Midlands Police are now investigating the alleged assault.

A force spokeswoman said: 'A woman was allegedly assaulted by another resident at the home on 24 September.

'No arrests have been made and police are investigating the alleged incident and supporting the family.'

'I understand that the lady has been reassessed by the home’s manager and it has been determined that her needs cannot be met within this setting.'
