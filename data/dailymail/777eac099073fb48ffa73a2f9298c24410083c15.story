It was a breathtaking symbol  of the power, prestige and  scientific supremacy of the British Empire.

Now the Crystal Palace, which housed the Great Exhibition of 1851, could be reincarnated – thanks to a billionaire Chinese developer.

Shanghai-based ZhongRong Holdings, owned by one of China’s richest men, wants to recreate the 900,000sq ft cast iron and plate glass building in the area of South-East London named after it.

Chinese developer ZhongRong Holdings has put forward a proposal to rebuild Crystal Palace. Owned by billionaire businessman Ni Zhaoxing, the firm wants to replicate the London venue built for the Great Exhibition of 1851.

The plan is still at the ‘very early 
stages’, sources said, but London Mayor Boris Johnson confirmed that he 
had been approached by a potential developer, thought to be billionaire 
Ni Zhaoxing.

The original structure was designed by Sir Joseph Paxton and stood in 
Hyde Park, where the exhibition was held. In 1854 it was rebuilt – in a 
larger form – on Penge Common, near Sydenham Hill in South London, and 
stood there until it was destroyed a fire in 1936.

According to business magazine Property Week, ZhongRong wants the 
replica Crystal Palace to host events and exhibitions and aims to submit
 a planning application later this year.

The company was set up in 1992 by Ni Zhaoxing, a married father of four 
and self-made businessman said to have a fortune of $1.25billion 
(£810million).

The 57-year-old was a new entry this year in the ‘billionaires list’ 
compiled by business bible Forbes magazine, and was placed at number 76 
in its ‘China rich list’.

Mr Ni’s past projects include the futuristic Zhongrong Jasper Tower in 
Shanghai’s financial district and Chang’an No.1 in Beijing, a group of 
‘78 European-style villas set in a mountain landscape’, Forbes said.

Devastation: A massive fire burnt Crystal Palace to the ground in 1936

Yesterday a spokesman for Mr Johnson said the mayor was ‘committed to 
finding a long-term  sustainable future for Crystal  Palace park’.

He confirmed that the mayor  and the borough of Bromley had been 
‘approached by a potential developer keen to redevelop a  large section 
of the north side of the park’.

The spokesman added: ‘Discussions between all parties remain  at a very 
early feasibility stage but the plans do not include any residential 
development.

‘Any fully formed proposal would of course be presented to the public 
for comment in order to build a consensus on the way forward.’

A Bromley Council spokesman said: ‘We are committed to improving Crystal
 Palace park, which remains a jewel not just in Bromley’s, but in 
London’s crown.

‘We are continuing to explore all funding options, including grant 
funding, that might be available to help secure a long-term and viable 
future.

‘As part of this, we have had discussions with a number of parties and all of these conversations remain at early stages.’
