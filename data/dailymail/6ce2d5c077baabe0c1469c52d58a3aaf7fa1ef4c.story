The huge reaction on social media and in the news following Jon Stewart's announcement that he is leaving The Daily Show after 16 years inspired the comedian's opening monologue during Wednesday night's show.

'Did I die?' joked the popular host of Comedy Central's The Daily Show who has won 19 Emmys and a Grammy.

'Last night I was perusing the internet, and I guess my question to you is, 'Did I die?' Cause it all seems very… 'I died.' Very weird,' Stewart said during Wednesday's episode.

'Did I die?' joked Jon Stewart during his opening monologue on Wednesday night's show in reaction to coverage of his decision to quit after 16 years

'It's an overwhelming day here, as you can imagine, and people have been asking, I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to do next.'

Stewart's surprise announcement prompted wall-to-wall media coverage in the 24 hours after his announcement with much written about his important role poking fun at politicians and also speculation about his replacement.

His longtime foe Arby's also got in on the action and jokingly tweeted him with the offer of a job.

 'Jon, feel free to reach out to us at careers@arbys.com,' read the cheeky tweet.

'You know what? Working there might be fun,' Stewart said. 

'I guess my only question as a future employee would be, to work there, would I have to handle, serve, touch, eat or even look at what you so generously describe as food?'

Comedy Central has a 'short list' of replacements for Stewart when he steps down later this year, company executive Doug Herzog said on Wednesday.

The channel and Stewart are consulting on when he'll depart the job he's held for more than 16 years and discussing whether he'll have a continued role with the show, said Herzog, president of Viacom Entertainment Group.

'TBD,' he replied, using the shorthand for 'to be determined,' then added: 'It's not out of the question.'

Stewart is an executive producer on the show as well as host. Stewart's company, Busboy Productions, produces The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, which replaced The Colbert Report.

Herzog said 'there's a short list' but wouldn't discuss any specific people being considered as host. 

It's uncertain whether the list includes former Daily Show correspondent John Oliver, who moved over to HBO after successfully filling in for Stewart when he took a movie-making break.

Asked about whether Oliver is a candidate, Herzog's reply was succinct.

Stewart couldn't resist a dig at the fast food chain and gave his customary criticism of their menu offerings

'John Oliver's got a job,' he said.

Asked if that meant he was not under consideration, Herzog said: 'I think he's spoken for.'

Whoever is chosen has heavy lifting to do.

'It's not easy. The shadow of Jon Stewart is going to loom large. ... What you have to get comfortable with is, it's just not going to be Jon Stewart. And it's going to be different,' Herzog said.

Whatever happens, he said, The Daily Show is 'a format that's built to last, and last it will.'

Herzog declined to comment on when Stewart, whose contract is up this fall, told Comedy Central of his decision to leave.

The comedians departure was announced by Comedy Central President Michele Ganeless after Stewart, host of the show since 1999, broke the news to the studio audience at Tuesday's taping in New York.

Stewart, slapping his desk and blinking back tears, told the audience that he had signed on to The Daily Show 17 years ago, and '17 years is the longest I have ever in my life held a job, by 16 years and five months.'

'This show doesn't deserve an even slightly restless host, and neither do you,' he said. It's yet to be decided when he'll leave or what comes next for him, Stewart said, with one exception.

'I'm gonna have dinner, on a school night, with my family,' he said.

Ganeless called Stewart, 52, a 'comic genius.' She did not specify his exit date or what led to his decision.

'Through his unique voice and vision, The Daily Show has become a cultural touchstone for millions of fans and an unparalleled platform for political comedy that will endure for years to come,' Ganeless said in a statement.

Stewart's influence is seen in the work of Stephen Colbert, John Oliver and Larry Wilmore, who went on to earn shows of their own. 

Other Daily Show alumni include Steve Carell, Ed Helms, Josh Gad and new Saturday Night Live Weekend Update anchor Michael Che.
