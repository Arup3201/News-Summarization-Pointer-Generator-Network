With an army of celebrity fans, from Sienna Miller to Kate Winslet, plus an array of supermodels keen to hang one from their slender arm, Mulberry has long been the handbag of choice for the A-listers.

And while the prices were always rather sky high,recently the high end fashion brand pushed up the cost of owning a Mulberry tote towards nearly £5,000 in a bid to tap into an even more exclusive luxury market.

But the ploy for the big bucks simply hasn't worked and Mulberry have now revealed plans for an about turn and will launch a more affordable range in a bid to win back loyal customers.

The news comes following a warning that its underlying annual profit would fall below expectations for the fourth time in two years.

Change of tack: Mulberry, whose collaborators include model Cara Delevingne, has pledged to make its products more affordable.

The luxury
 goods firm said that profit before tax for the year ended 31 March 2014
 was now expected to be around £14million, while analysts had been 
expecting around £19million.

The
 group, which is still looking for a new chief executive after last 
month's departure of Bruno Guillon, said it will look to refocus its 
sales efforts on offering products at more affordable prices.

The new strategy was unveiled by former head Godfrey Davis, who oversaw the rapid growth of the Mulberry brand between 2002 and 2012. He has returned to the helm on a temporary basis until a permanent boss is found.

The British luxury label enlisted Cara Delevigne to be their model of the moment. She designed and helped model a mini collection of bags including this signature camouflage backpack

Under former boss, Mr Guillon's leadership, Mulberry pushed up prices in an attempt to become even more exclusive, with products such as the Bayswater and Alexa handbags selling for up to £4,500.

However, the increase in prices alienated the company's core customer base, triggering a slew of profit warnings.

Creative director Emma Hill also resigned from the group last year amid speculation over disagreements with Mr Guillon.

Following her appointment in 2008, Ms Hill was credited with transforming the company into an international fashion powerhouse with a number of celebrity fans, including Kate Winslet and Sienna Miller.

Mulberry shares fell 4 per cent after today's latest profits warning and have more than halved in value since the start of 2013.

In January, the group issued a profit warning after heavy discounting over Christmas in Britain and weak demand in South Korea dampened sales.

In implementing a new strategy, Mr Davis warned that there will be a short-term 'material' negative impact on profits but it was necessary to ensure the future strength of the Mulberry brand.

Disappointing sales: Mulberry has seen a drop in profit over the last 12 months.

Davis said the firm will slow the rate of store openings from eight for 2013/14 to five for the 2014/15 financial year, in order to control costs and enable existing stores to gain traction.

He added that Mulberry's new factory in Somerset, which opened in June, was now fully operational with more than 300 workers.

The Bridgwater-based facilities were created thanks to £2.5million worth of investment from the Government's Regional Growth Fund with the hope of doubling Mulberry's UK capacity.

Mr Davis said: 'Following the recent change in management, we are focusing on achieving sales growth through the reinforcement of our product offering at more affordable prices to meet the expectations of our loyal customers.

'This will have short term financial consequences but is necessary to ensure the future strength of the Mulberry brand,' he added.

Owning a Mulberry handbag used to be the dream for professional young women.

Smart
 and stylish and just out of reach for most style-conscious 
twenty-somethings, they would quietly covet the beautiful leather day 
bags while saving for a wallet or purse from the brand.

Then, in 2009, the game-changing Alexa arrived and suddenly Mulberry became the must-have label to be hanging from arms.

This
 was the height of the 'it' bag era and the classic British company used 'it' 
girl Alexa Chung to revamp and rebrand sending their sales figures 
soaring.

With prices 
starting at £525 the bags were expensive but not completely 
unaffordable, and a generation of young women skipped a rent payment or 
two to get their hands on one of the range.

Bosses
 at the Somerset firm were of course, delighted, and celebrity-endorsed 
product became a strategy to keep the cool, young, things coming back 
for more.

The introduction 
of the Del Ray, inspired by singer Lana Del Ray at London Fashion Week in February 2012 raised a few eyebrows as the then 19-year-old was relatively new on the 
scene, but the fashion press lapped it up and sales continued to rise, 
as did the confidence of the brand.

So confident were they in fact, that they decided to start inflating prices to keep up with the high-end designer labels like Gucci, Tom Ford and Saint Laurent.

The brand was now charging upwards of £1,000 for fast fashion items designed to appeal to a young market so it was no surprise when profit warnings began circulating.

The
 penultimate nail in the coffin for 
Mulberry's current sky-high pricing strategy was the departure of 
creative guru Emma Hill. The city took a dim dim view of Hill's 
departure. The response of Luca Solca, managing director of luxury at 
investment company Exane BNP Paribas, was typical: 'Mulberry is trying 
to reposition itself to the high end . . . Mulberry in my view should be
 cheaper than Burberry and Gucci.

'There
 is little choice for handbags between £250 and £600. Market results 
indicate that Mulberry's upmarket ambitions are facing hurdles.'

In
 other words, Mulberry's price inflation was greed rather than good 
sense. No one ever thought of it thinks of it in the Prada or Hermes 
league, its appeal was something else.

The final nail came in the
 shape of model-of-the-moment Cara Delevingne who designed the label's 
latest collection after already being a face of the brand.

Cara
 is one of the world's leading models, but her fan base is young and 
cool... and definitely doesn't have £1,500 to spend on a handbag.

The
 problem is that the women who do have £1,500 to spend on a handbag 
don't want to wear a rucksack endorsed by a 21-year-old famous for her eyebrows and expanding tattoo collection.
