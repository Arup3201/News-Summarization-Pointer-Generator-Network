Honda has revealed its new compact sports utility vehicle — the HR-V — which goes on sale next summer from £16,000.

And if you want to see a prototype and place an early order, head for the Paris Motor Show next month.

Based on the Jazz hatchback, it's the Japanese giant's answer to the quirky, but successful, Nissan Juke, Peugeot's 2008 and the stylish Renault Captur.

It also marks a return of the HR-V name, last used on a Honda nine years ago in 2005 as the baby brother to the larger CR-V. Honda says the 'baby' offroader combines coupe-like design with the versatility and stability of a 4x4.

Placing the fuel tank in the middle of the vehicle maximises internal space, while Honda's 'magic seats' offer highly flexible seating. A spokesman said: 'There's a wide range of configurations, with the ability to fold the second row of seats for added cargo space.'

Meanwhile, Honda has issued the first details of its new Jazz super-mini, which also makes its European debut at the Paris show.

Slightly longer than the car it replaces, it introduces a completely new body shell for the bigselling model.

Honda says it will also offer improved fuel economy and higher performance thanks to its new 1.3 litre i-VTEC petrol engine linked to either a six-speed manual (replacing the previous five-speed unit) or an automatic continuously variable transmission (CVT). 

A remarkable 20 per cent of all radio listening takes place in cars. Yet 27 million UK vehicles still cannot receive digital radio.

So for those fed up with scrabbling around trying to find the right radio station or even a decent signal on the car stereo, help may soon be at hand.

Radioplayer, the not-for-profit online 'one-stop-shop' for finding radio stations, run by the BBC and commercial radio, has launched a prototype 'hybrid' in-car adaptor said to offer listeners the 'maximum choice of radio stations, with minimum tuning fuss'.

It has been developed in conjunction with West Midlands audio firm Connects2. The small device, fitted behind the dashboard, is controlled by an app on the driver's smartphone.

Radioplayer boss Michael Hill says: 'The device scans DAB, DAB+, FM, and internet sources, automatically selecting the best platform to deliver any station. If a signal is lost, it switches seamlessly and safely to the same station on another platform.'

Priced from around £46,000, Volvo says the new XC90 off-roader is aimed at buyers looking for 'a head-turner' that radiates a truly sporty and dynamic look'

Volvo's new XC90 off-roader, has made waves even before hitting showrooms or having its covers lifted in Paris.

The first 1,927 individually numbered black first edition XC90s were offered for sale exclusively online and they sold out in 47 hours. Now the company is showing off the sportiest top-of-the range member of the family, the R-Design. Order books open next month for deliveries from May.

Priced from around £46,000, Volvo says it's aimed at buyers looking for 'a head-turner' that radiates a truly sporty and dynamic look'.

If you can't wait for one, consider a used version of the outgoing range. It was judged the best-value large SUV in the recent What Car? Used Car of the Year awards sponsored by Warranty Direct.

The Ford Focus 1.6 105 Zetec 5dr was voted the overall winner, as well as clinching the best family car category. The best luxury car award went to Jaguar's XJ 3.0D V6 Luxury.

Ray Massey was honoured at the Headline Auto Awards in London for more than 20 years of writing about motoring in print and online

Ahead of the pack...

I was touched to be honoured this week to receive an 'outstanding achievement' gong sponsored by Magma at the Headline Auto Awards held in London. In front of industry leaders and my peers, it marked more than 20 years of writing about motoring in print and online. It always gives a warm glow to be recognised. Mind you, it wasn't so long ago I'd have set my heart on the 'rising star' award. Time doesn't so much fly as accelerate — like a Bugatti Veyron.
