Manchester United are in discussions over a deal for Valenciennes defender Dayot Upamecano.

The 16-year-old centre-back has played for France at U16 and U17 level and has been watched closely by Monaco and Paris St Germain.

However, United are close to agreeing terms if they can iron out the compensation due to the French Ligue 2 club.

Valenciennes are looking for up to £700,000 which would be based on bonuses.

Any potential deal is excluded from the deadline day cut-off because of the defender’s age.

Louis van Gaal has been heavily linked with a move for a defender during the transfer window.

But reported moves for the likes of Mats Hummels have failed to materialise as United look set for a quiet end to the transfer window.
