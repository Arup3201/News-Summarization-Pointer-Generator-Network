The real slave trade: An early depiction of what John Murrell, a notorious slave and horse thief, may have looked like

Director Quentin Tarantino is famed for his gory subject matter but Django Unchained, his film about the violence of the slave trade before the American Civil War is more realistic than many critics would realise.

The Oscar-winning film is set in 1858, and reflects the contemporary mood of mob rule and casual violence.

In the film Django, played by Jamie 
Foxx, is a freed slave who journeys to reclaim his bride Broomhilda, played
by Kerry Washington, from a slave owner, with plenty of bloody battles along the way.

Two new history books about American slavery suggest that Tarantino's nightmare vision of the period is not that far off the mark.

The books paint a picture of how violence and fear pervaded American society at that time.

The summer of 1835 was a particularly lawless one. Widespread panic broke out in the Southern states, after a man named  Virgil Stewart wrote a sensational pamphlet that claimed a slave rebellion plot, financed by highwaymen and 
Northern Abolitionists, was imminent.

Rumours rapidly spread that this plot was true according to The Daily Beast.

At the time Virgil Stewart was 
pursuing John Murrell, one of American history's most infamous bandits known as the 'great land pirate of Tennessee', 
on suspicion he had stolen two slaves with him.

Stewart alleged that this slave rebellion was going to be led by Murrell, a professional horse thief and slave stealer, planned for Christmas Day that year.

People living around the Mississippi River and in Tennessee lived in fear of contact the 'Murrell Klan' though so much folklore surrounds them the full extent of Murrell's crimes remain hazy.

He was first arrested in 1822, when he would have been about sixteen, and there began his life as an outlaw.  The local papers were terrified of him, believing to have hundreds of men in his thrall.

According to tradition, Murrell's band of thieves used to meet in a forest in Arkansas, just across the Mississippi River, where they formed their often murderous plans. 

Among many grizzly crimes Murrell was believed to have murdered the whole crew of a flatboat to steal the goods on board.

In
the ensuing panic of a Murrell plot in Mississippi, nervous white Southerners formed 
vigilante groups, seeking out potential collaborators.

They whipped 
confessions out of slaves that they were involved in the plot, and they were hanged. 

How many slaves were killed altogether is not known, but the number is likely to be in the dozens.

The slaves' confessions also 
implicated white men in the alleged Murrell plot. A self-appointed local
committee handed out their idea of justice and hanged five of them.

When
a prominent doctor was gunned down in the fracas, a mob lynched five 
professional gamblers they believed to be responsible.

In many plantations that summer dozens more men were executed, out of fear that they were implicated with gangs of slave thieves.

None of this was lost on another subject of an Oscar-winning film of the year - future president Abraham Lincoln.

In a speech three years later, Lincoln told the audience that the hangings were so numerous that 'dead men 
were seen literally dangling from the boughs of trees upon every road 
side; and in numbers almost sufficient, to rival the native Spanish moss
of the country.'

Lincoln went on to be one of America's most loved presidents and eventually banned slavery throughout the nation.
