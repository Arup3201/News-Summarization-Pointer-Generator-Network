More than 100 residents have been 
trapped in their village for almost a fortnight after heavy flooding cut
off all access roads - and they face the possibility of being stranded 
there until Christmas.

The Somerset village of Muchelney, 
which lies in between Taunton and Yeovil, has been cut off since 
November 22 after roads flooded - and residents were being taken by boat 
to buy essential items.

Some households have no electricity or
water - but one couple refused to leave because they have sheep and 
cattle to rear, while another woman was forced out because of her 
medical condition.

Environment Agency spokesman Paul Gainey told MailOnline today: ‘Unfortunately the village is on a flood plain, so when they get very heavy rain the water tends to sit around where people live.

‘The single access road into there means they have been cut off for about a week and a half. There is not much we can do about it - we’ll just have to wait until the water level drops.

‘The people here are used to it. It’s happened before. Over the last two weeks we’ve had very heavy rain and that was the catalyst. We’ve been ferrying people in a motor boat and inflatable dingy.’

The village, which is situated next to the River Parrett with an average house price of £325,000 and an English Heritage property in Muchelney Abbey, is 10 miles away from the nearest train station.

Reverend Jess Pitman yesterday had to catch a lift on a farmer’s tractor to take a morning service at the village’s 15th century Church of St Peter and St Paul and meet families who have been suffering.

The flood is believed to be the worst in Muchelney - which rather aptly means ‘Big Island’ in Saxon - for 90 years, and many of the congregation also travelled by tractor.

Churchwarden Elizabeth Nightingale told the Western Daily Press: ‘We usually have a congregation of around 16 but because of the floods we are also having a get-together.'

Fire officials said last week that the access road to Muchelney was under 6ft of water, and police insisted residents told them they did not wish to be evacuated and wanted to remain in their homes.

'I think it will take at least a week before I can take the tractor out and it may be three weeks before cars can go through. We have to put up with it'

Graham Walker, Muchelney farmer

He told MailOnline that the villagers were relying on boats to take them to dry land so they could pick up their post and shop for provisions - and then to take them back to their village again.

Muchelney farmers Graham and Helen Walker said they were not leaving their home because they had to tend to 50 sheep and cattle, but it was pleasing to see the community pull together.

‘I think it will take at least a week before I can take the tractor out and it may be three weeks before cars can go through,’ Mr Walker told the Western Gazette. ‘We just have to put up with it.’
