Members of a Secret Service special unit responsible for patrolling near the White House were pulled off that assignment over at least two months in 2011 to protect the assistant of the agency's director while she was engaged in a dispute with a neighbor, according to a report in The Washington Post.

Agents were told that the Secret Service director at the time, Mark Sullivan, was concerned that his assistant was being harassed by her neighbor, the Post reported in a story posted Saturday night on its website.

The newspaper cited three people familiar with the operation but did not provide their names.

The agents were pulled from a surveillance team that patrols the outskirts of the White House compound and monitors the southern side of the executive mansion whenever crowds gather to watch the president and first family travel via motorcade or helicopter, the Post reported.

Pulled from duty: A new report says that U.S. secret service agents tasked with patrolling the White House perimeter were removed from their post for two months in 2011 to monitor the friend of the then-director of Secret Service, Mark Sullivan

Agents inside the Washington field office were concerned that the diversion of agents increased security risks to the compound and the president, two people familiar with the discussion told the newspaper.

A spokesman for the agency told the Post that the agents involved were not part of the president's protective detail and therefore the operation had no impact on it.

Sullivan left the Secret Service in 2013 nearly a year after a scandal involving members of the presidential protection team hiring prostitutes ahead of a trip by President Barack Obama to Colombia in 2012.

In a statement to the Post, Sullivan said a supervisor in his office authorized the visits to the assistant's home without his knowledge, that they lasted only a few days and that they were appropriate given the report of threats to an employee.

Called 'Operation Moonlight' within the agency, the assignment that summer of 2011 called for two agents twice a day, in the morning and at night, to monitor the home of his assistant, the Post reported.

It's personal: Former Secret Service director Mark Sullivan reportedly pulled agents from duty in order to protect his assistant, Lisa Chopey, who was having a dispute with her neighbors in Maryland

The residence was in a rural area outside the southern Maryland town of La Plata, nearly an hour's drive from Washington.

Two agents put on Operation Moonlight thought the reassignment was a potentially illegal use of government resources and were concerned enough about their own liability that they kept records of their involvement and their superiors' instructions, the Post reported.

The woman being monitored, Brenda Allen, said that the assistant involved, Lisa Chopey, had taken a restraining order against her partner, Michael Mulligan.

Chopey accused Mulligan of once chasing her down in his truck.

'It was pure hell,' she said.

'It felt like an invasion.

'I still don't understand it. I worked for the FBI for 22 years - I'm not a threat.'

Mulligan and Allen said they approached one of the cars one day to ask the occupants why they were parked in front of the house. But they said the car sped off.

The couple said they barely went outside their house when the cars were there. Eventually, the mysterious surveillance and the tensions with the Chopey family led them to move, they said.

Over time, the agents’ trips to La Plata grew less frequent, according to people familiar with the work, and by early fall, Operation Moonlight was over.

Mulligan and Allen said they did not know they had been under Secret Service surveillance until informed last week by The Washington Post. 

'I don't think the Secret Service should have been down to my house, watching me all the time,' Allen said. 

'What threat do we pose? Why so much attention for this woman?'

Some informed the inspector general for the Homeland Security Department about the operation, the newspaper said.

White House spokesman Jay Carney said the White House was not aware of the allegations involving the president's protection and referred questions to the Secret Service, according to the Post.

Scene: Four agents - two in the morning and two in the evening - were reportedly sent to the town of La Plata, Maryland, about a one hour drive from Washington, for the 'special assignment'

Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan confirmed that agents were pulled off their White House duty to check on the safety of the director's assistant.

However, he disputed accounts that Operation Moonlight lasted for months, saying agency records indicated that the assignment took place for only a few days over the Fourth of July weekend.

Donovan said the operation was part of the agency's standard response to potential threats to an employee.

House Intelligence Committee chairman Mike Rogers questioned the Secret Service's 'leadership culture' after the organization's latest 'black mark.'

'This is just one more example of a leadership failure at the secret service,' Rogers said on CBS on Sunday morning. 'When you have someone removed from a post whose primary responsibility is to protect the president and the White House's occupants, that is very, very concerning.'

Rogers said the latest incident was of special concern because the current director of the Secret Service, Julia Pierson, was the chief of staff of the Secret Service at the time.

'So they're going to have some explaining to do, and maybe they've got great explanations. But they're going to have to come up and explain it, Rogers said.

;And if they can't get this piece right, I think you're going to have to look at a cultural leadership shift in the secret service.'
