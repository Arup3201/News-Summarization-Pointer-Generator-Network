Trial: Abid Naseer goes on trial today in New York after pleading not guilty to accusations of a conspiracy to bomb the New York City subway

A terror suspect on trial in New York was among several young recruits under orders by Al Qaeda to infiltrate Western society and pull off the biggest operation since the September 11 attacks, a prosecutor said Tuesday in opening statements.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Celia Cohen told jurors in federal court in Brooklyn that the failed conspiracy in 2009 called for attacks in New York City, England and Denmark. 

She said that Abid Naseer, 28, who is acting as his own attorney, headed a cell in Manchester, England, where he attended college as part of his cover and communicated in coded emails with his Al Qaeda handler about the cell's plan to attack a shopping mall.

The jury will be the first to see evidence seized during the Navy SEAL raid in 2011 that left Osama bin Laden dead, Cohen said.

In his opening statement, Naseer read in a monotone voice from prepared remarks in which he referred to himself in the third person. 

He said that the time he spent on the Internet on sites like Qiran.com was part of his quest to find a woman to marry, he said.

'The evidence at trial will not show the defendant is an Al Qaeda member. ... He has no extremist or jihadist views,' Naseer said.

Naseer objected several times during the testimony by the first government witness, former Queens resident Najibullah Zazi, who pleaded guilty in the New York City prong of the plot that targeted the subways. 

For instance, he challenged the introduction of a photo of bin Laden but was overruled.

'I agree with you that this case is not about 9/11,' U.S. District Judge Raymond Dearie told Naseer during a break. 

But the judge said Zazi should be able to reference Bin Laden in describing how he became radicalized.

Aside from Zazi, other witnesses will include testimony from British secret agents who will wear wigs and makeup on the witness stand to conceal their identities. 

The agents conducted surveillance on Naseer and other terror suspects in Britain before their arrests in April 2009. 

After no explosives were found, the men were released without being charged but ordered to leave the country — a fate Naseer avoided after a judge ruled it was likely he would be mistreated if he were sent to Pakistan.

Naseer was rearrested at the request of U.S. prosecutors and extradited to the United States in 2013.

'That was the whole point of the Western operatives. ... They knew how to blend in and conduct reconnaissance and pick the best target,' Cohen said. The goal, she added, was to 'repeat the devastation of 9/11.'

Meanwhile, a document said to be the Al Qaeda pledge of allegiance is among the classified papers to be disclosed at the trial of the alleged would-be terrorist.

The text of the Al Qaeda 'pledge of allegiance', which has been translated by prosecutors. 

We, of course, take the pledge of allegiance on behalf of Sheikh Usama bin Laden. We say in the wording something like: I accept your allegiance on behalf of Sheikh Usama, to listen and obey, in hardship and ease, and to follow whomsoever Sheikh Usama assigns to be my Amir on the jihad for the sake of God, for the establishment of the religion of God, and the rule of Islam that governs the law of God, and to memorise the secrets of the group, and to be where I am ordered to.

Prosecutor Celia Cohen said in her opening statement on Tuesday in New York that Abid Naseer headed a terror cell in Manchester, England. 

The trial is set to feature evidence seized during the Navy SEAL raid in 2011 that killed bin Laden, including an oath Naseer presumably took on joining the terror kingpin's organisation.

The pledge is among eight documents found among bin Laden's possessions and declassified for the trial, which will also hear testimony from British spies who have been given permission to take the witness stand in disguises.

If convicted, Pakistan-born Naseer who denies he was a member of Al Qaeda, faces a possible life sentence. He says he holds 'no extremist jihadist views'.

Two government witnesses to testify against him - Najibullah Zazi and Zarein Ahmedzay - have already pleaded guilty to the subway plot.

Prosecutors claim email account evidence shows all three men were under the direction of the same Al Qaeda handler.

They also say one of the now-declassified documents seized by SEAL Team 6 during the bin Laden raid mentions Naseer and refers to the Manchester and New York plots.

The pledge of allegiance to Al Qaeda, which has been translated by prosecutors for the court's benefit, is also due to be given as evidence, according to the New York Daily News. 

Statements: Naseer listens to opening statements in his trial as seen in a courtroom sketch he went on trial on Wednesday on U.S. charges that he took part in an Al Qaeda plot to carry out bombing attacks in the United States and Europe in 2008 and 2009

The vow binds those who utter it to 'follow whomsoever Sheikh Usama assigns to be my Amir on the jihad for the sake of God, for the establishment of the religion of God, and the rule of Islam that governs the law of God.'

At a pretrial hearing, U.S. District Judge Raymond Dearie approved a request from Britain's internal intelligence service, MI5, for its agents to give evidence in disguise.

Prosecutors had told the judge that the officers continue to work undercover on sensitive cases and 'disclosure of their identities would pose a significant risk to their safety'.

The agents will testify using identification numbers rather than names and wearing wigs and make up, the papers added.

A former resident of Cheetham Hill, Manchester, Naseer was one of 12 people arrested in the UK in April 2009 as alleged members of an al Qaida-backed terror cell.

After no explosives were found, the men were released without being charged but ordered to leave the country - a fate Naseer avoided after a judge ruled it was likely he would be mistreated if he were sent to Pakistan.

In a lengthy written statement submitted during the deportation proceedings, Naseer claimed to come from a moderate Muslim family.

He said he went to Great Britain to get a degree in computer science, not to attack the West, he said. 'Committing terrorist acts is not justified, and I do not consider this to be jihad,' he said. 'I believe in spiritual jihad.'

The time he spent on the Internet on sites like Qiran.com was part of his quest to find a woman to marry, he said.

'I used to spend all night on the internet in chat rooms talking to girls,' he wrote.

Naseer also denied allegations that he used code words to conceal messages about the terror plots. 

In one, he talked about having a 'party' in Manchester in April 2009 — what British counterterrorism officials said was the proposed time for the attack.

'My reference to holding a huge party and trying to include as many as possible was referring to the intended wedding,' he said. 

Authorities rearrested Naseer in July 2010 at the request of U.S. prosecutors. He was extradited from the UK in 2013.
