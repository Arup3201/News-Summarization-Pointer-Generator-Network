He had risen from humble beginnings to become a Harley Street doctor providing cosmetic surgery to millionaire clients.

But when a lost wallet containing £2,500 was given to staff at Starbucks, Abdul Choudhuri spotted the opportunity to make more money and claimed it as his own – even though it was his wife who handed it in.

When the lie was exposed and the doctor arrested, he continued to insist that the money was his – and claimed that he often carried up to 20 wallets in his ‘man bag’.

Later, he even tried to wreck the trial by calling a witness and trying to trick her into believing it had been cancelled.

Choudhuri, 41, was jailed for 30 months at Nottingham Crown Court yesterday after being convicted of fraud and two counts of attempting to pervert the course of justice.

Prosecutors described him as ‘a thoroughly dishonest and highly manipulative individual who has gone to extreme lengths in order to avoid conviction’.

The wallet belonged to a tourist from Singapore, who returned to the Nottingham Starbucks branch hours later – only to be told it had been claimed by another man. It had contained £2,500 and a 1,000 dollar Singapore note – worth around £500.

Staff realised what had happened and phoned police to report the crime.

They didn’t have Choudhuri’s name but he was recognised by staff member Lisa Wright a month later when he returned to the branch, the court heard.

Police arrived and arrested Choudhuri, who claimed to know a superintendent in the force and told the officers they would ‘lose their jobs’.

When he was searched a 1,000 dollar Singapore note was found in the wallet he was carrying.

Miss Wright, a witness in the trial, later received a call from Choudhuri or a man acting on his behalf claiming to be from the ‘witness protection scheme’ to inform her that the trial was cancelled. It was a ruse to stop the witness going to court to give evidence against him, the jury heard.

The doctor also tried to set up a false alibi by pressuring his accountant into saying they had a meeting in the afternoon when in fact it took place in the morning.

Choudhuri claimed that clients in his private medical practice included royalty from the Middle East, Hollywood stars and rich footballers’ wives. He said he believed the wallet in Starbucks was his as he routinely carried many with him. One on the day in question in October 2010 he claimed to have had 20 wallets in a ‘man bag’.

Choudhuri said he was carrying the Singapore banknote when arrested because wealthy international clients often paid him in currency from their own countries.

Asked by his barrister, David Dein, if he had ever broken the law, Choudhuri replied: ‘I’ve always made it my mantra to respect the police and stay out of trouble.’

However, the court was told after his arrest, he sent a text message to his wife that read: ‘If pigs ask you anything, it is always no comment. Don’t tell them anything.’

Choudhuri was also ordered to pay £23,395 prosecution costs and £4,000 compensation to the tourist.

Mr Dein said taking the wallet was a ‘moment of inexplicable madness’.

He added that Choudhuri’s career as a doctor was now over as it was ‘almost certain’ he would be struck off by the General Medical Council.

Choudhuri, who was the only pupil from his comprehensive to go to university, ran a business called Body Perfect with his wife, Dr Fatima Jabbar.

It has clinics in London, Nottingham, Beverly Hills and Monaco.
