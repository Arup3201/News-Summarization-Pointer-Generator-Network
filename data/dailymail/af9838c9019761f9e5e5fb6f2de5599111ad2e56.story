An investigation of the incident is underway but officials do not believe that the plane was damaged by a bird strike because of the altitude it was traveling at.

Journalist Tim Kelley posted a picture of the cracked windscreen on his website.

The plane had been in the air less than an hour when the pilot announced a 'problem in the cockpit' and that the aircraft would need to land.

Mr Kelley wrote: 'The captain periodically announced updates in a calm professional voice,
saying he ''has 30 years of experience, and there is a procedure we must
follow... our windshield has pretty much disintegrated.. we will be 
landing in Orlando in a few minutes.'''

An American Airlines spokesman told MailOnline on Wednesday: 'American Airlines Flight 106 from Miami to Boston took off from Miami at 8.31pm local time yesterday. The Captain reported a cracked windshield during the flight.

'The flight landed in Orlando for repairs at 10.34pm. We swapped aircraft and the flight re-departed at 12.07am and arrived in Boston at 2.21am.

'Unfortunately, it made for a very long night for our customers. It was a Boeing 757 aircraft with 150 customers and a crew of six.'
