The 62-year-old widow charged with the murder of her husband after his body was found buried in their front yard allegedly told a friend she was going to kill him, it emerged today.

Neola Robinson, from Texas, was arrested on Saturday for the murder of her husband Pleasant Ervin 'Shorty' Robinson, 52, who went missing in June 2010.

The month before, Robinson angrily said to a friend while they were drinking at a bar that she didn't want her husband of three years to come home 'because if he does he’s going to be missing some body parts, or I’m going to kill him. I don't care if I go to prison.'

The 62-year-old has been charged with murder. She is on suicide watch in prison where she is being held on $150,000 bail.

Charged: Neola Robinson, 62, is charged in connection with the murder of her husband, Ervin Robinson

Buried: The body of Neola Robinson's husband, Ervin, was found in the front yard of the home where they used to live

Shorty's daughter Crystal Robinson 
told the Star Telegram her father had been married eight times before 
and she thought he had finally met someone who made her happy.

Their problems started when she was 
injured in a car wreck in October 2009. She had to stop working and grew
 jealous about her husband's female friends.

Crystal said by May the following 
year her dad planned on leaving his wife and removed all the funds from 
their joint checking account and opened a separate one.

Soon after, Robinson became 
upset with her husband when he went to a friend’s funeral against her 
wishes.

According to the search warrant affidavit, hours after the funeral, Neola Robinson found her husband at Lynn’s 
Saloon in Azle with one of his female friends.

That’s when she said her husband had better not come home or 
she would dismember or kill him, according to the affidavit.

Four days later, police responded to a 
domestic dispute at the house where Neola Robinson had locked her 
husband outside because he refused to give her money, the document said.

Michael Wright, co-owner of TJ 
Machine & Tool in Azle, where Shorty Robinson had worked, filed the 
missing-person report on June 16, 2010, after Robinson didn’t show up 
for two weeks.

Hidden in plain sight: Ervin had gone missing in May 2010 yet his wife simply told people that he had left her for another woman

Marital troubles: The couple were often heard arguing and had violent episodes but it has still come as shock to many in the community

He said he was not surprised by the recent discovery.

'I had always suspected that something bad had happened to him,' Wright said on Wednesday.

Pleasant Ervin Robinson was last seen
 on May 29, 2010, on a store security video in the Fort Worth suburb of 
Lake Worth buying food and mattresses.

The warrant was to search the house for blood evidence, financial documents and DNA.

His wife went to the machine shop 
where he worked in early June and was shaking as she said: 'He's gone. 
He's gone,' saying that he packed up some belongings and left on May 31,
 2010, the document said.

Officers searching the home in June 2010 found what appeared to be a large blood stain in the bathroom.

The officer said the home was clean 
and the kitchen floor appeared to have been recently scrubbed, although 
the home was cluttered and dirty when he responded to the domestic 
dispute the previous month, according to the document.

Bank records show that activity 
continued on his personal bank account after he was reported missing, 
and Neola Robinson can be seen in a bank's ATM video and a store's 
security video using a debit card from his bank account, according to 
the 2010 affidavit.

Disbelief: Neighbours cannot believe how a woman who is on disability benefits was able to bury her husbands body in their front yard

Good inentions: Although Ervin Robinson had a lengthy criminal history including robbery and DWI, his friends say he was turning things around. His wife remains in Tarrant County Jail on $150,000 bail
