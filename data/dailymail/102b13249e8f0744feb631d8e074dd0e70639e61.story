The mayor of Toledo, Ohio, remains in a critical condition on Monday, a day after having a heart attack while driving in snowy weather that caused him to crash into a utility pole.

Mayor Michael Collins, 70, is being heavily sedated and closely monitored at the University of Toledo Medical Center's intensive care unit. Doctors say it is too early to put an estimate on the 'timing or likelihood of his recovery.' 

Evelyn Johnson, 42, who saw the mayor's crashed SUV around 2pm Sunday stopped, smashed through his locked window and administered CPR until emergency personnel arrived.

Authorities have extended appreciation to Johnson for her 'heroic efforts'.

Dr. Christopher Cooper, a cardiologist and dean of the University of Toledo medical school, said Collins was not conscious when Johnson found him.

The retired police officer and former city councilman is married to Sandy Drabik. They have three daughters and eight grandchildren.

City Council President Paula Hicks-Hudson, 63, was sworn in as acting mayor Sunday afternoon.

She praised Johnson who rendered first aid to the mayor.

'The act of this one person who was there at our mayor's time of need shows this is a great city,' Hicks-Hudson said at a news conference Sunday.

Collins became mayor in January 2014. The independent's first year in office has been tumultuous. 

Shortly after he was sworn in, two city firefighters died battling an apartment fire, and the city endured the worst winter in its history.

Summer brought widespread, toxic algae blooms in Lake Erie that caused the city to cut off water service to 400,000 people in the Toledo area. 

And in October, it was learned that Fiat Chrysler Automobiles might move production of the Jeep Wrangler from Toledo to another U.S. plant when it redesigns the vehicle. 

The mayor’s medical crisis followed a meeting he had with a Lucas County Sheriff where it was agreed to issue a Level 3 snow emergency notice, allowing only emergency vehicles on the road.

He was alone in his car at the time as he traveled home to South Toledo after picking up groceries in West Toledo.

Officials said they would give an update on Collins' condition before midday Monday.
