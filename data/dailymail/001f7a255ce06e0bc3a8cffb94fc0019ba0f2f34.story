After 65 years of marriage, one Brazilian couple's bond was so strong they stayed together even in death.

Italvino and Diva Poss passed away in the same hospital room, side-by-side, only 40 minutes apart.

Italvino, 89, had been hospitalized with leukemia since last August.

Meanwhile, Diva was receiving chemotherapy for a tumor, Express UK reports.  

Diva reportedly asked family to gather at the hospital sometime last week as her condition worsened. 

'She felt that her time was coming and asked to see her relatives,' grandson Rafael Max told reporters. 'My grandfather went to [her room in the] hospital too. They had a private conversation together and after that they both seemed at peace with everything.' 

The Huffington Post reports that nurses moved Italvino into a vacant bed next to Diva then moved the beds together so the couple could hold hands.

Italvino was the first to go.

'After he died my aunt whispered in my grandmother's ear that my grandfather had passed away in peace,' Rafael said. 'At that moment she became more peaceful. It was as if he had opened the doors for her to go to, as if he was arranging for them both to be together forever.'

Just 40 minutes later, Diva had died too.

'I've never seen anything like it,' Rafael said. 

The couple first met at a dance in 1948, where Italvino was smitten at first sight.

'[My grandfather] always said that they had been married for a year longer, because he counted it from the day they met,' Rafael said. 'He considered their marriage one eternal date.'

They were never apart for a day and every morning Italvino cooked Diva breakfast.

He even made sure the garden was filled with her favorite vegetables.
