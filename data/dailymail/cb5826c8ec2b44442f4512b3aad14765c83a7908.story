More than 6,000 pubs have shut over the past eight years thanks to sky-high taxes and government red tape.

The smoking ban, increases in alcohol duty and declining real wages since the recession have directly contributed to more than half of all closures since 2006.

The Institute of Economic Affairs said that taxes on drink in the UK are so high that British drinkers pay 40 per cent of the amount raised in alcohol duty raised across the whole of the EU. 

A think tank has warned that more than 6,000 pubs have shut over the past eight years, including this boarded up establishment in central London, due to high taxes and the smoking ban

The think tank called for an end to the thrust of recent government policy which it said had actively discouraged people from visiting their local.

As part of a radical package of measures to save the British pub, it demanded the watering down of the smoking ban allow people to smoke in special rooms.

Report author, Christopher Snowdon, said: 'British pubs may be suffering from long-term cultural shifts, but government policies have hugely exacerbated this trend.

'Taxation and regulation have been the leading causes of the decimation of the UK pub industry since 2006.

'The level of alcohol duty in the UK is hugely regressive, hitting the poorest the hardest.

'Taxes must be lowered, and one-size-fits-all policies like the current smoking ban must be reconsidered if we are to temper the rate of decline of the British pub.'

The report said that although the last forty years have been characterised by a drastic decline in the pub industry, the rate of closures has accelerated over the past decade thanks to the smoking ban and tax hikes

Since 2006 the number of pubs has plummeted from just over 58,000 to 48,000, a drop of nearly 20 per cent.

In his report, Closing Time – Who's killing the British pub?, Mr Snowdon found that changing social trends- such as changing tastes and the shift towards home drinking – did not alone explain the rapid acceleration of pub closures in recent years.

Instead, policies such as the smoking ban and alcohol duty escalator are responsible for speeding up the rate of closures in the past decade compared to the last forty years of steady decline in the pub industry.

'In 2008 the government raised alcohol duty by six per cent in real terms and introduced a duty escalator that automatically increased alcohol taxes by two per cent above inflation every year thereafter,' he said.

'In 2011, VAT rose to 20 per cent. Combined with falling real wages during the recession, drinking has become much less affordable. The escalator was finally abandoned this year, yet taxes remain high.'

Traditional pubs (like the one pictured) are under threat unless the government water down the smoking ban to allow people to smoke in special rooms

He argued there was no need to bow to calls for government intervention in the form of taxpayers' money to boost failing pubs.

Instead, to end the downward spiral of the industry, Mr Snowden claimed ministers must lower alcohol duty and VAT, as well as reconsidering one-size-fits-all policies such as the smoking ban.

The report said some cultural changes were also damaging the British pub, with a 16 per cent fall in beer purchases in supermarkets and off-licenses since 2003, but a 'colossal' 54 per cent fall in beer purchases in pubs.

It means pubs are selling half as much beer as they did eleven years ago - largely thanks to a move towards cheap drinks in supermarkets.

Economic changes have also led to better domestic living conditions, a shrinking of the working class and decline of heavy industry, which explain some changes to the health of the pub industry. The post-2006 decline, however, is exceptional and gradual cultural change cannot explain it.

Much of the blame, however, is lain squarely at the door of the government.

The report said: 'The past seven years have been characterised by a flurry of policies which have severely damaged the pub industry. 

The smoking ban, introduced in 2007, has also had a big impact.

'Although only 20 per cent of Brits smoke regularly, smokers have always been disproportionately more likely to drink and visit pubs,' the report said.

'Following the introduction of the smoking ban, the amount of pub customers who smoked fell from 54 per cent to under 40 per cent in just two years.'

The IEA called on ministers to halve alcohol duty - pointing out that British drinkers pay 40 per cent of the EU's entire alcohol duty bill.

Halving the duty would bring it into line with the European average, which would reduce both the cost of living and alcohol fraud.

The think tank added that VAT should be lowered from 20 per cent to 15 per cent, with a lower rate of VAT for food sold in pubs and restaurants, as happens in many European countries

Calling the smoking ban 'one of the most uncompromising' in the world, the IEA said there is clearly a market for venues that allow smoking in one or more ventilated rooms.

The think tank also said planning rules which currently prohibit new pubs from opening in areas of high demand should be scrapped.
