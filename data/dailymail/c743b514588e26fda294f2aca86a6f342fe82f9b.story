George Osborne is facing questions 
over his relationship with Andy Coulson after claims he was paying back a
 favour by helping the former News of the World editor get a job with 
the Tories.

A lawyer representing phone hacking 
victims says the now-defunct tabloid underplayed their coverage of sex 
and drugs allegations against him in October 2005.

Six years ago the paper ran on its front page hotly 
disputed claims from former prostitute and ex-drug user Natalie Rowe 
that the Chancellor took cocaine in his early 20s, before he became an 
MP.

Mark Lewis said Mr Coulson, editor of 
the paper the time the story broke in October 2005, deliberately played 
down the scandal in the leader column, effectively saving Mr Osborne’s 
political career.

Mr Lewis told Australian TV: 'The 
editor at the time was Andy Coulson, and I think that's worth 
remembering because of the future relationship that we have between the 
Conservative Party, the Prime Minister and Andy Coulson.'

He added: 'Andy Coulson had done 
George Osborner a favour; perhaps it was time for George Osborne to 
reciprocate and do a favour back.'

But Tory MPs rounded on Mr Lewis, calling it a 'spurious' attempt to embarrass the Chancellor with 'the wprst sort of smear'.

In the leader column the paper said Mr
 Osborne was 'a young man when he found himself in a murky world', and 
said it was up to the voters to judge at election time.

Mr Lewis said: ‘The decision on which 
spin to give to the story by the editor of the News of the World 
particularly was something that determined his future in politics.

‘If it would have been written the other way it would have finished his career I’m sure.’

In July, as the phone-hacking scandal 
broke, Rebekah Brooks, Mr Coulson's successor at the NotW, told MPs that
 the chancellor had played a key role in his appointment as David 
Cameron's media adviser.

Mark Lewis, a solicitor who represents
 many of the celebrities said to have had their voicemail messages 
intercepted by the News of the World, was speaking after Miss Rowe 
repeated the cocaine allegations on Australian television.

She told ABC’s PM programme she sold 
her lurid story to the Sunday Mirror in 2005 and was surprised to see it
 appear simultaneously in the News of the World, then edited by Andy 
Coulson.

She and her lawyer claim the paper obtained the story by hacking her phone.

Tory MPs condemned Mr Lewis's latest claims as a spurious attempt to smear the Chancellor.

Patrick Mercer said: ‘This is the 
worst sort of smear, where an account that has previously been put to 
bed is raised again on the back of other allegations.

‘It is a vacuous attempt to breathe 
life into an issue that has already died, by a lawyer who is clearly 
looking for financial advantage.’

Mark Field, another Tory MP, said: ‘It
 appears to be a rather spurious attempt to embarrass a senior minister 
and link the government to the phone hacking scandal using the most 
lurid of claims.’

Miss Rowe is believed to have spoken 
out abroad because of the legal difficulties in having such an interview
 broadcast in this country.

She explained that in 2005, a picture 
surfaced which showed Mr Osborne sitting alongside her when she was 
working as a dominatrix known as ‘Mistress Pain’.

The photograph was taken in a London 
flat in about 1993 or 1994, when Mr Osborne was in his early 20s. It has
 been claimed previously that a line of a cocaine can be seen on the 
table in front of them.

In her TV interview, Miss 
Rowe, now in her mid-40s, claimed she was ‘more than just a friend’ of 
Mr Osborne and insisted he had been a regular user of the Class A drug.

A source close to Mr Osborne said it was ridiculous to claim that the Chancellor had helped Mr Coulson come to work for the Tories because he owed him a favour.

The source pointed out that it was all of two years later that the journalist joined the Conservatives: ‘There’s nothing in it. If there had been someone would have said something about it at the time.’

Although the picture was taken before Mr Osborne entered politics, it was published when he had taken centre stage in the Conservative party as shadow chancellor.

Only a few months earlier he had managed David Cameron’s successful campaign to become Tory party leader.
