Iconic images of history's most famous public figures and moments have been reimagined in our narcissistic era of the 'selfie.'

The images were created for the Cape Times, a South African newspaper, by advertising agency Low Cape Town.

The reworked photographs were used in advertisements for the paper, accompanied by taglines such as, 'Every story feels like a first-hand account,' and 'You can't get any closer to the news.'

Kennedy and a cigar-smoking Winston Churchill.Cape Times executive editor Alide Dasnois said, 'At first we weren’t sure it would work, but the campaign has been brilliantly executed. Lowe has done the Cape Times proud.'

The agency, realizing that print media is under threat from digital and social media, wanted to remind readers of the importance of good reporting with a method that would resonate with the times. 'In the past we have spoken about the objectivity of great journalism, this time we wanted to speak about good reporting being close to the source,' says creative director at Lowe and Partners Kirk Gainsford.

'We tried to match the time of the story to the masthead of the news paper at the time of the story.'The rise and rise of the selfie - a self-conscious, self-taken snap of oneself - has resulted in the Oxford English Dictionary naming it the word of 2013. The shots, reimagined as self-portraits, turn the iconic images into intimate glimpses into the lives of the great and the good.
