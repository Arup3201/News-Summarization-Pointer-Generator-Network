Former President George H.W. Bush served as an official witness at a same-sex wedding over the weekend. 

The 41st president was pictured signing a set of documents at an outdoor celebration for the Maine wedding of Bonnie Clement and Helen Thorgalsen.

Thorgalsen posted the photo to her Facebook wall on Sunday with the caption, 'Getting our marriage license witnessed!'

Clement and Thorgalsen are co-owners of a Kennebunk general store.

'This has been a wonderful wedding experience for us and we were honored to have President and Mrs. Bush not only in attendance but also happy to sign our license,' Thorgalsen, who is with her wife on their honeymoon in London, told ABC News.

'As Nancy Sosa, our officiant, said, "God did not make a love that is wrong." If we can make a difference in the world with our wedding and marriage, we are thrilled,' she added.

Bush rep Jim McGrath confirmed to the Washington Post that the former president and his wife attended the wedding.

'They were private citizens attending a private ceremony for two friends,' he said.

The couple posted this photo at Boston Logan International Airport on Monday with the caption: 'The beginning of another adventure!! See you in London!'

Many of Thorgalsen's friends commented 
on the photo of Bush and commended the former president for his official
role in the couple's union.

'I think this picture should go national. Most definitely a historical moment!!!' wrote Katherine Lee Reece. 

Steven Webb added, 'Awesome - not just for you, but for all the others waiting for the right to marry.'

Bush, who is 89 years old,  owns an estate in neighboring Kennebunkport, Maine. He spent much of his childhood there and inherited the property after the death of his parents.
