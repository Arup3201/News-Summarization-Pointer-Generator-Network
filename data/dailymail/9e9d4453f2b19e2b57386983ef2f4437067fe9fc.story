'Too few ethnic minorities in top positions': David Cameron says he wants to live to see an British Asian as Prime Minster 

David Cameron last night said he wants to see a ‘Prime Minister with a British Asian name’ in his lifetime.

The Prime Minister warned Britain is not achieving its full potential because prejudicial barriers still remain against ethnic minorities. 

There was ‘a glaring absence’ of diversity among figures at the top of public life in Britain.

Mr Cameron said at the GG2 Leadership Awards sponsored by the Daily Mail: ‘One day I want to hear that title “Prime Minister” followed by a British Asian name.

‘In Britain today there are still too few ethnic minorities in top positions. Let us think big about what Britons of all backgrounds can achieve. When I hear “sir”, “your honour” or “right honourable”, I want them to be followed by a British Asian name.

‘The absence is glaring in the boardrooms of the FTSE 250, in the chambers of the Houses of Parliament, on football managers’ benches; on high court judges’ benches and in our fighter jets, our naval ships, our armed battalions around the world.

‘I am clear: this has to change. Not to tick boxes or fulfil quotas – but to fulfil potential.

‘Because Britain will only be the best it can be when its people – when all its people – are all they can be.

‘So I think there are three big things we, everyone here, can do: First, remove the barriers that stop people getting on. Second, attack prejudice. And third, celebrate role models. Because only then can we create a country where everyone – whatever their background – can get on.’

At the ceremony in London, Pesala Bandara won the award for Young Journalist of the Year.

Culture Secretary Sajid Javid topped a power list of the most influential Asians in the UK, ahead of teenage activist Malala Yousafzai.

Mr Javid became the first Asian male Conservative cabinet minister in April after rapidly rising through the ranks of the party.

Judges of the Power List, compiled by the Asian Media and Marketing Group, said Mr Javid earned the title for being the only Asian voice at the heart of the Government’s senior decision-making process and his commitment to ‘opening the cultural doors for all Britons in the UK’.

He pushed 17-year-old Malala, who became the youngest ever Nobel prize winner last month for her work championing global education rights for girls, into second place.

Bromsgrove MP and father of four Mr Javid, a former managing director at Deutsche Bank, has been tipped as a potential future leader for the Conservative Party.

The power list, now in its fourth year, named Labour MPs Keith Vaz and Sadiq Khan at number three and seven respectively and Tory MPs Priti Patel and Shilesh Vara at numbers six and nine.

The list also features 19 women, including BBC presenter Naga Munchetty and Radio One presenter Jameela Jamil as well as the director of Liberty Shami Chakrabarti.
