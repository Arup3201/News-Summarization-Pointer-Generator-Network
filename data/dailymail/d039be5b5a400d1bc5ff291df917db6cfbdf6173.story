James Bond may have favoured Aston Martin’s road cars, but the firm has produced its most extreme supercar yet.

Called the Vulcan, the track-only car has 800 brake horse power, which is much more powerful than the DBS that James Bond drove in last film.

Aston Martin says the limited edition supercar, which cannot be driven on roads, is built for ‘extreme performance’ and even comes with a driving lesson so its new owners can control it.

Pure power: Aston Martin has unveiled its track-only car called the Vulcan, which has 800 brake horse power. Only 24 will be made and each will cost £1.8 million ($2.3 million) – although customers will be able to choose from an ‘almost infinitely flexible’ variety of colours and trims.

Only 24 will be made and each will cost £1.5 million plus local taxes (around $2.3 million) – although customers will be able to choose from an ‘almost infinitely flexible’ variety of colours and trims.

It has a seven litre V12 engine developed by Aston Martin Racing positioned towards just behind the front axle of the car, and a Xtrac six-speed sequential gearbox that sends power to the rear wheels.

‘This supercar is powered by the most potent iteration yet of the company’s naturally-aspirated, 7.0-litre V12 petrol engine,’ the Warwickshire-based firm says.

While there are no performance figures available yet, the car should be fast, based on its huge engine and light carbon fibre body.

Aston Martin says that its power-to-weight ratio exceed those of the GTE cars which compete in the FIA’s annual World Endurance Championship.

The Vulcan is so powerful that Aston Martin is selling it with driving lessons.

People who buy it will be offered ‘an extensive and detailed programme of intensive track driver training,’ by experienced racers.

The lessons are designed to work on their track driving technique through a series of hands-on sessions driving other less powerful Aston Martins.

The company says people will build experience in the V12 Vantage S and One-77 road cars and the Vantage GT4 race car before driving their own Vulcan.

They will also be able to use a virtual race car simulator, like Formula One drivers, to hone people’s racing technique.

Aston Martin’s Director of Special Projects and Motorsport, David King said track day events will be held next year at ‘some of the world’s most famous and glamorous race circuits.’

It has ceramic racing disk brakes measuring 38cm (15 inches) in diameter on the front wheels and 36cm (14 inches) on the back, as well as adjustable anti-lock braking and variable traction control.

It’s very low, at 3ft 11 inches (1.19 metres) tall and has wide rubber 10 inch (25cm) wheels to keep it on the road.

The car’s interior is stripped down and has a racing steering wheel, angled dashboard and large screen.

Aston Martin’s CEO, Dr Andy Palmer, said: ‘Aston Martin Vulcan is, by its very nature, a rare and thrilling supercar.

‘Designed and engineered to deliver a genuinely bespoke driving experience that draws on our rich heritage, this car tailors its power and handling to both the capabilities of the driver and the characteristics of the track.

People who do purchase the car will be offered ‘an extensive and detailed programme of intensive track driver training,’ by experienced racers.

A spokesman told MailOnline that its name was ‘inspired by the awesome power of the famous aircraft – the Avro Vulcan bomber’.

Intriguingly, Aston Martin said that the car’s design hints at the next generation of its sports cars.

Dr Palmer said Aston Martin has already received ‘strong interest’ from customers.
