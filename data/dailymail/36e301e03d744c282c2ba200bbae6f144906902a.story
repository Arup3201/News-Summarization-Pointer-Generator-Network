Palmistry is the ancient art of predicting the future through the reading of palm lines.

The art is hugely popular in Japan where palm readers charge optimistic customers upwards of £50 a session to tell them what the future could hold, simply by looking at the markings on their hands.

But and now for those not content with the fortune lines that nature gave them there is a drastic new way of trying to be master of their own destiny: by altering their palm lines through cosmetic surgery.

The surgery, which has also been known to be carried out in Korea, is performed with an 
electric scalpel which burns the flesh leaving a semi-permanent scar.

The people of Japan, where palmistry is huge, are having their palm lines improved by cosmetic surgery to enhance their fate

A report on The Daily Beast found that between January 2011 and May this year, 37 palm 
plastic surgeries have been performed at one clinic in Japan.

Shonan Beauty Clinic offers the surgery for £662 but no longer advertises the treatment because they couldn't keep up with demand.

Dr Matsuoka, who has performed 20 of the operations, told The Daily Beast: 'If you try to create a palm line with a
 laser, it heals, and it won’t leave a clear mark.

'You have to use the 
electric scalpel and make a shaky incision on purpose, because palm 
lines are never completely straight.

'If you don’t burn the skin and just
 use a plain scalpel, the lines don’t form. It’s not a difficult 
surgery, but it has to be done right.'

The procedure usually takes 10 to 15 minutes and can include between 5 to 10 lines being on the palm being altered.

One clinic in Japan offers the surgery for £662 and it takes around 15 minutes to complete. Men want their financial lines lengthening and women opt for enhancement to their marriage line

Some patients use a marker pen to show the surgeon which lines they want extending prior to surgery.

It takes around a month for the wounds to heal and for the new palm lines to form.

Most of the patients are thirty-something men and women who have a predilection for fortune-telling.

Whilst men want their money line or success line extending, women want their love/marriage line lengthening.

Some women don't even have a marriage line and believe that because of this, they won't find love.

Others do have a marriage line but seek another one because they believe their first one appeared too early and they missed their chance.

But does it work?

Dr Matsuoka gave one woman a wedding line and soon after she wrote to him saying she had married.

Two other patients won the lottery after he extended their fortune lines.

Despite these success stories, Matsuoka isn't, however, sure how effective the surgery really is and believes there may be a placebo effect.

'If people think they’ll be lucky, sometimes they become lucky. And it’s not like the palm lines are really written in stone — they’re basically wrinkles,' he adds.

He explains that lines do change with time and even the way people use their hands can change them.

Some palmisters reportedly suggest that their clients who don't want to undergo the surgery can draw the lines on their hands themselves to change their fortune.

 'The placebo effect could positively 
change somebody's attitude but it is not enough to justify unnecessary 
surgical intervention. Try a lucky charm maybe...’

Subodh Gupta, a London-based palm reader, says the surgery is futile.

'I read about this surgery and I was very surprised.

'Even by having surgery, the lines cannot be changed.

'If you want to improve your fortune, take physical actions. So if you want greater health, do some exercise.

'I have seen people's health lines change after six months of yoga.'

Dr. Yannis Alexandrides, founder, director and head of practice and surgical at 111 Harley St in London, added: ‘It is possible to have complications from this type of surgery such as infection and painful neuromas which can create a source of irritation.

'The placebo effect could positively change somebody's attitude but it is not enough to justify unnecessary surgical intervention.

'Try a lucky charm maybe.’
