They haven't always enjoyed the kindest of press but that wasn't enough to stop the Duchess of Cornwall from spending the afternoon touring a newsroom.

But this was far from being your average Fleet Street outfit. Instead, Camilla was at First News - the world's largest paper for children.

Dressed in a tailored brown suit by Bruce Oldfield, the Duchess was all smiles as she toured the newsroom, shaking hands with editorial staff and budding journalists alike.

Grand opening: The Duchess of Cornwall opened the new offices of children's newspaper, First News

Among them was Chloe Miller, 11, who was trying her hand at reporting, and her colleague - budding photographer Kai Patel, also 11.

As the duchess was introduced to the newspaper's staff Kai snapped away like a seasoned professional, while Chloe questioned her in a way that would have done Jeremy Paxman proud.

Camilla, who is patron of the National Literacy Trust, features in the next issue of First News, in which she answers questions on her reading habits.

Chloe, 11, from Stanmore in north  London, said: 'She wanted me to choose a photo of her for First News and then she said that if she could be any book character she would be Winnie the Pooh.

'I asked her why and she said she would love to have her fingers stuck in honey. I thought that was a good excuse.'

Kai, from Stanwell Moor, Surrey, said he only discovered he was going to be taking photographs of a member of the royal family when a camera was thrust into his hands this morning - his very first day.

Looking good: Camilla was on glamorous form in a brown Bruce Oldfield suit and her trademark pearls

Well done: The Duchess, who was flanked by budding reporter Chloe Miller, 11, appeared to enjoy the visit

He said: 'It has been been a real honour to meet the Duchess of Cornwall. She is just like everyone else and was talking to me like an adult in a normal way.'

After meeting the newspaper staff Camilla was told about the work of Children United - and she was given a taste of how it will work when she took part in a Skype session between children at the First News office and a group of school children in Uganda, who sang for the duchess.

Available as a printed paper in the UK and digitally abroad, First News has more than two million young readers and has racked up a number of awards for its contribution to children's issues.

Among them is Children United, an interactive web-based communication platform that is freely available to children across the world. 

Impressive: Also on hand to greet the Duchess was 11-year-old Kai Patel - a would-be photographer

On deadline! Camilla shared a joke with 11-year-old Chloe Miller during the tour of the newspaper's offices

When Camilla arrived, the young reporters were using the tool to chat with their counterparts in Uganda - one of the many countries to benefit from the technology.

It was all a far cry from the Duchess' first visit of the day which, with Prince Charles, had been to the offices of this newspaper in London's Kensington.

The royal couple were touring the Evening Standard, which shares the building with MailOnline, and met the paper's editorial staff and its owner, Evgeny Lebedev.

Charles also shared a joke with the newspaper's royal editor Robert Jobson as he and the duchess posed for a photo in front of an Evening Standard banner, quipping 'cheap publicity!' as he obliged.

Nevertheless, the heir to the throne still managed to make an impression, with football columnist Patrick Barclay describing him as an 'absolute hero'.

'He is my absolute hero in this country,' he said. 'At the risk of sounding like a footballer in a cup final, this is a dream come true meeting this gentleman.'

Real deal: Earlier, Charles was at Northcliffe House - the headquarters of London's Evening Standard
