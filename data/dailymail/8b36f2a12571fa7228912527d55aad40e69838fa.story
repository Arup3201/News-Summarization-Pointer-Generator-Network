Sales of new cars to private buyers soared by nearly a quarter last month in a 'resilient' market –  pushing overall sales up by 12 per cent, official figures reveal today.

But there is strong evidence of motorists and families 'down-sizing' from bigger cars to smaller, more frugal, fuel-efficient  and environmentally vehicles – with the Ford Fiesta 'super-mini' the biggest seller.

It means new car sales for the year are now on course to burst through the 2 million mark – higher than previously expects, said the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).

The influx of household consumers' cash in particular into the motor industry gave an encouraging boost of confidence and glimmer of hope amid the economic gloom.

A  total of 151,252 cars were registered in October 2012 - a 12.1per cent rise on the October 2011 figure. But private sales last month rose by almost 24per cent –  with households buying 68,191 cars compared to 55,043 last October.

Sales of alternatively-fuelled 'green' vehicles soared almost 39per cent – but still remain relatively low at 2,206. The private-sale boom took the year-to-date total sales figure to 1,771,861 - a 5per cent rise on the January-October 2011 total.

As a result of the  private-buyer boost, the SMMT has revised upwards its forecast for full-year sales to more than two million vehicles - compared with 1.94 million in 2011. However, the year-to-date figure for 2012 is still some 16per cent - or 335,000 vehicles -  below the 2007 pre-recession volume.

The SMMT report said: 'Against a backdrop of weak European demand for cars the UK market has proved remarkably resilient.

'It has increased in every month this year, apart from February, which is traditionally a low-volume month.

'The growth in 2012 reflects an improvement in private demand, while fleet demand has sustained the volumes recovered in 2011.'

It adds: 'Demand for small cars has risen rapidly, in part due to new models.'

The 'Mini' segment has grown by 52.0 per cent  over the year-to-date and the Supermini segment by 5.8 per cent. Collectively these two segments account for close to 40per cent of the market.

The Ford Fiesta – which falls into the 'super-mini' category – was the best-selling new car in October and the year-to-date.

The report adds: 'The SMMT has revised up its full year 2012 forecast to 2.013 million units from 1.97 million forecast in July and 1.92 million at the start of the year.

'The market is forecast to be stable in 2013 at 2.015 million units.'

SMMT chief executive Paul Everitt said: 'Despite uncertainty in the European economy, the UK new car market continues to grow.

'It is encouraging to see the alternatively-fuelled vehicle market performing strongly.

'Although this sector represents only a small share of the overall market, it is vital that the Government sustains its consumer incentive programme and maximises the benefits available through the vehicle taxation system.'
