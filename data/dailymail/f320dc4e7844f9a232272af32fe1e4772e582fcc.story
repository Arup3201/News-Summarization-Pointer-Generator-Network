A drag racer is lucky to be alive after her car burst into flames, in a spectacular explosion down the quarter mile, while doing almost 400 kilometres an hour, but incredibly she still won.

Queensland drag racer Christine Steffens was up against Mark Sheehan in the three race Nitro thunder match race series at the Perth Motorplex on Saturday night.

Steffens, an accountant who is based at Gatton, south east of the state, started off in the lead down the quarter mile in her green 'croc' Nitro funny car but soon got into trouble.

The drag car burst into flames down the quarter mile at Perth Motorplex, it's believed the engine exploded

At top speed, ABC News said the vehicle suffered an engine explosion before it was engulfed by a fireball of flames.

Luckily enough Steffens was able to escape via a roof hatch before the vehicle came to rest beside the safety barrier where smoke billowed out and flames continued to spread. 

Fire and rescue crews were shortly on the scene to extinguish the flames. 

It's believed after a quick pedal, the supercharger backfired, resulting in the fireball, which then sent a piece of shrapnel into a front tyre, which caused the car to swerve to the safety barrier.

'It was on a real mission, I don't know why I pedalled it, and it just exploded. It was instanteous,' Steffens told dragnews.com.au.

Despite the explosion it didn't stop her chances at a series win, defeating the Western Australian driver 2-1, the car still running an impressive 5.42 seconds over the quarter mile.

The former modified and outlaws racer is the only female in Australia who gets behind the wheel of a nitro funny car, which can reach speeds of up to 500 kilometres per hour.

Steffens, who has been in the drag racing sport for around 18 years, drives the recognisable green croc funny car with her husband Ricky.
