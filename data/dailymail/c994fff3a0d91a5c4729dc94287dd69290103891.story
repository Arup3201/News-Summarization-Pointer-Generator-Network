Mark Tucker had no intentions of publishing his deepest and darkest thoughts.

The Melbourne father of two merely penned his emotionally churning divorce as a cathartic experience.

It was one particular moment, seven years ago, that turned his world upside down. The night he opened a message from his wife's phone which confirmed his biggest fears.

'Goodnight my love,' the message read.

Mr Tucker's 17 years of marriage was over after the discovery of these three words.

'I felt sick and light headed,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

Mark Tucker's first book documents his struggle through divorce and becoming a better father

'I suspected a little because she had been withdrawn for a few months so when I found the message from another man on her phone, it confirmed my fears.

'It was a tough discovery and I didn’t know what was going to happen next.'

The 51-year-old thought he had the perfect family and it had never crossed his mind that he may once become a single father.

'I was the bloke who went to work to earn money for the family and I was quite happy with that role,' he said.

'My then wife had her traditional role and I had mine.'

After a devastating confrontation, he made the heartbreaking decision of divorce when his wife left him for another man.

'Emotionally it took me three months to really get a grip that this was the way it was going to be,' Mr Tucker said.

'I had hoped that maybe she would come back but at the same time, I wasn't sure that was going to have a good outcome.'

He took on the role of being the prime parent to his two daughters Sophie and Annabel, who at the time were aged 14 and 12.

But he soon came to a daunting realisation that he hadn't been the best father to his girls.

'I thought I was close with the girls,' he said.

'But going through the divorce, I had connected with the two girls on an emotional level like I'd never done before.

'I'm not saying I'm a perfect father now but I think I've become a better father and I think my children would say the same.'

Then came the moment of truth.

'I had no idea about running a house which made me reflect on how much I wasn't involved in the process beforehand,' he said.

'I was so inefficient when it came to running a house – it took me half an hour to just find the iron and some nights I would finish the house work at 9.30pm.

'But we [daughters] bonded through that as a team and I started building a close relationship with them.'

And it's the love for his daughters that still connects him with his ex-wife.

'We do talk and we're civil with each other because I feel it's the best way for me to deal with it all,' Mr Tucker said.

'Although our relationship is fractured, our death do us part vows still apply even when we're divorced because we're bound by our children – whether we like it or not.'

Mr Tucker remarried four years ago. He became a husband to Alison and a father to her sons

Mr Tucker starting writing his book two years after the divorce which was around the time he found love again.

A year later, he remarried and became a husband to Alison and her two sons.

Having survived his divorce, he hopes his book will help encourage other men in similar situations to embrace single parenting.

'When I look back, I've grown as a person and in some ways it's been a great opportunity,' he said.

'It's important for men to take a chance and I was determined at the time to show people that I could do it.'

Mr Tucker believes that unfortunately in this day and age, men are 'getting the raw deal when it comes to divorce or separation'.

'My view is that women are better placed in divorce because there's more acceptance about women being the prime parent,' he said.

'There is a gernal perception that men are unable to cope with raising a family on their own and the working arrangements are better for women than men.

'People were puzzled as to why I had the children but really, men are just as entitled to share the care for their children.'

Mr Tucker's final message in his book reflects the good life he's been able to achieve, despite the trauma of his divorce.

'There is no magic want that you can wave to make yourself a successful single father,' he wrote.

'Your new job is a simple one. It is to be the best dad that you can be and to give your children the best life that you possibly can.

'The most important thing is to stay strong and work on it day by day.'

Single Father, Better Dad will be released on August 21.
