They are normally tasked with apprehending criminals but on this occasion two police officers had a very different target to contend with.

Footage has emerged of the two officers battling to try and capture an escaped pig in a residential area of Missouri.

The video was captured by Wildwood resident Graham Howatt on Wednesday afternoon after he spotted the officers struggling to control the belligerent hog.

Speaking to the policemen, Howatt can be heard saying that he believes the animal belongs to a neighbour across the street.

‘We hear it squealing every once in a while,’ he adds.

Despite attempting to capture the pig, the two officers seem to spend most of their time actually running away from the animal.

As the hog snorts and follows them around, the officers can be seen trying to hold it at arm's length while they try to decide what to do with it.

As the determined hog snorts and snuffles around, the policemen can be seen hurriedly shutting the doors to their car so it doesn't get in.

Eventually they settle on a plan to corner the animal and get a rope around its neck to hold it in place until animal control arrives.
