Mental health staff have been accused of 'lamentable failures' by a coroner after they left a man alone to kill himself despite having seen a noose on a visit to his home.

Bryan Jobson, 44, was visited at his home in Leeds by nurses David Bibbings and Paul Oates after being called to the house by Leeds Partnership Foundation Trust's crisis team.

But Mr Jobson was found hanged the following day after the pair left him alone in the house despite his 'suicidal state of mind.'

Wakefield Coroner's Court had heard that Mr Jobson's relationship with his wife had broken down and he had been in relationships with two men who both died in tragic circumstances.

Coroner David Hinchliff said that Mr Jobson had probably been left depressed by personal tragedy, but added that his death could have been prevented had the nurses acted differently.

Following a two-day inquest, Mr Hinchliff said in a narrative verdict: 'Bryan was the victim of lamentable failures of two experienced key workers from the Crisis Resolution Home Treatment Team who, despite visiting Bryan and observing a ligature in place and Bryan's suicidal state of mind, left him alone in the house - placing the responsibility of Bryan's safety on him, which enabled him to deliberately end his life by and act of self suspension at his home address.

'Bryan Jobson's death could have been prevented then had those key workers removed the ligature and remained with Bryan, or alternatively arranged Bryan's admission to hospital, either informally or pursuant to a Section of the Mental Health Act or made immediate contact with Bryan's family to stay with him until he could be seen by the Acute Crisis Service the next day.'

Following the verdict, Mr Jobson's sister Teresa McDarby, also criticised the mental health workers.

She said: 'If they had done their jobs right he would have been alive the next day.'

Mr Jobson had been diagnosed with an adjustment disorder and was said to be drinking heavily.

Both Mr Oates and Mr Bibbings had been interviewed under police caution following Mr Jobson's death and were investigated to see if a charge of gross negligence manslaughter could be brought against them.

But the Crown Prosecution Service had decided against a prosecution due to a lack of evidence.

Earlier in the hearing, Mr Bibbings said that he was worried that he had no legal right to remove the noose from Mr Jobson's house.

He said: 'I have been told previously that we had no legal right to do things like that and that was in the forefront of my mind.'

When questioned by Mr Jobson's sister, Teresa McDarby, about why the noose was left where the carers found it, he added: 'It does seem very damning but we were thinking about legal aspects of our behaviour as we do when we are in someone's home.

'That is that person's home and they own everything in it.

'I know it seems ridiculous but we do have rules to abide by, we are not happy about it.'

Speaking after the verdict Mr Jobson's
 sister Teresa McDarby said: 'It's good to see that see the coroner 
identified the failings.

'Bryan
 had presented historically as not engaging with the services so if he 
is not engaging with the services why didn't they take him away that 
night?

'They weren't professional, they didn't behave in a professional manner.

'If they had done their jobs right he would have been alive the next day.

'Who
 knows what would have transpired but the fact is we are talking about 
that day and that could have been and should have been avoided.'

Dr Guy Brookes, a psychiatrist and associate medical director with the trust, gave evidence at the inquest on Monday.

Coroner David Hinchliff asked Dr Brookes: 'What these two nurses did was to try and seek reassurance from Bryan that he wouldn't do anything inappropriate and he would engage with the service the next day.'

Dr Brookes replied: 'Yes.'

Mr Hinchliff said: 'He has set up a ligature hasn't he, which they saw?'

He added: 'Would you agree with me that it was foolish in the extreme to leave a person with Bryan's history and mental health alone in his home when he has set up a ligature in the way he has, expecting him to voluntarily engage with the service the following day in the light of him being un-cooperative?'

Dr Brookes said: 'I think without reducing the risk significantly, yes, I would agree with you.'
