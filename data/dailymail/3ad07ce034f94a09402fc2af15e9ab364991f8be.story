The woman was reportedly trying to leave Sydney Airport using her own passport and she was stopped because she was listed a 'person of interest'.

She was released but was stopped from leaving Australia. 

Elomar, a former boxer from western Sydney who left to fight in Syria late last year, has been disowned by his family after learning of his brutality as a member of IS.

His father, Mamdouh Elomar, said his son made him sick: 'When I see him on the news, it's very bad. I'm very shamed. I'm not proud.'

Mamdouh said has not talked to his son in two years after a falling out his son Mohamed who worked as a surveyor or draftsman at the family business.

'I cannot understand what my son did, it makes me want to vomit,' he said. 

The Elomar patriarch is also friends with community leader Dr Jamal Rifi Mohamed threatened the doctor on Twitter after Dr Rifi condemned him. 

Mamdouh said every time he saw his son on the news he could not help but feel ashamed by Mohamed's actions. 

Sources say Elomar's sister was on a ­no-fly list because of the relationship to her brother, who has boasted of his brutal terrorist activities in Iraq and Syria. 

Elomar has including posting images of himself holding the severed heads of Syrian soldiers. 

Friends of Elomar's sister reportedly said border control she was not bound Iraq or Syria, where her brother is fighting with the ­Islamic State.

'This was a mistake. She was not going there. She was travelling for other reasons,' one friend told Daily Telegraph. 

Elomar is believed to have travelled to the Middle East with his sadistic sidekick Khaled Sharrouf, who slipped out of the country last December using his brother's passport.

The pair have since become the evil face of social media, regularly posting images of their atrocities.

When it was discovered he had gone to Syria, his sister had insisted he had travelled there for humanitarian purposes.

Sources claimed the detection of Elomar's sister at Sydney Airport demonstrated the success of heightened security measures at the airport which have closed the gaps in the system which had allowed Sharrouf to slip out undetected. 

Mohammad Ali Baryalei, a former Kings Cross bouncer who played a bit part in Underbelly, has been identified as a senior military commander in the Islamic State. He recruited Elomar into ISIS

Elomar has warned on Facebook that the Islamic state will hold its position in Iraq and Syria 'by victory or martyrdom' and dismissed US military operations in Iraq and Syria.

When asked about media reports that Islamic State fighters are trying to return to their home countries, Elomar told News Corp: 'Maybe it's true, maybe it's propaganda. But Islamic State still holds its position either by victory or martyrdom. Besides, what can a bunch of planes do?'

Elomar, using the Facebook pseudonym 'Al Australi Abu Hafs', also claimed that American air strikes only 'hit civilians, not the Mujahideen'.

He then began referencing Chapter 9 of the Quran, which contains the 'Verse of the Sword' passage terrorists often cite to justify jihad.

'And when the forbidden months have passed, kill the idolaters wherever you find them and take them prisoners, and beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them at every place of ambush.

'But if they repent and observe Prayer and pay the Zakat, then leave their way free. Surely, Allah is Most Forgiving, Merciful,' the verse reads. 

A spokesperson for the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection told Daily Mail Australia: 'The Government will not be providing a running commentary on these matters.

'The Government will take the steps necessary at our borders to protect our national security.

'At times, this will mean that national security takes priority over the convenience of the traveller.

'Our officers do not stop travellers indiscriminately.' 

Omarjan Azari (pictured) has been charged with a serious terrorism related offence and allegedly plotted to behead a member of the public in Martin Place

On Thursday  at least 800 officers from AFP and NSW Police were involved in Australia's biggest anti-terror raids.

Omarjan Azari appeared in court on the same day charged with a conspiracy to prepare a terrorist attack on Australian soil.

He was denied bail and will reappear in court on November 13. 

He is the second man charged so far after police arrested 15 people in the raids. 

According to court documents, police intercepted a phone call three days ago between Omarjan Azari and Mohammad Ali Baryalei, who is alleged to have recruited half of the 60 Australians fighting in the Middle East.

The account said Baryalei ordered him to carry out an attack, which Sydney Central Local Court heard was 'clearly designed to shock, horror and terrify the community'.

'Afghanis are traditionally more interested in study than sport,' the accused's cousin Rami Azari told Daily Mail Australia.

'There was another Greek kid who wasn't as good but Omarjan knew he wanted it desperately and so Omarjan gave up his place.

'He was always interested in justice and fighting against injustice.

'Maybe [that's what got him into trouble.' 

'I don't believe that he made the phone call [making the beheading threat],' Omarjan's cousin said.

'He'd stopped using his phone because he was being followed by police and ASIO.'

Omarjan's uncle, University of Western Sydney lecturer in Afghani studies, Dr Ehsan Azari, said his nephew was 'very pious'.

'But if he is truly involved in this it is someone else who has convinced him, turned his mind,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'He was not a scholar, or very good at school.'  

Prime Minister Tony Abbott increases Australia's terrorism threat level from medium to high and warns Australians to expect increased security on September 11. 

Australians will see more security at airports, ports, military bases, government buildings, public landmarks and major sporting events.

It's the highest alert level in more than a decade and means the chances of a terror strike is now considered 'much more likely'.
