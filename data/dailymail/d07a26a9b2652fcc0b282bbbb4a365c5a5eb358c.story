While it may not be the obvious choice to hold a wedding reception, one couple who chose their local McDonald's could at least guarantee their guests' food would arrive quickly.

Fast-food fans Steven Asher and Emily Marshall had spent the past year enjoying a string of romantic dates at the Golden Arches, so it seemed like the obvious place to toast their nuptials when they tied the knot on Saturday.

They arrived in a stretch limo and dined with their 33 guests in a roped-off area at their local branch in Bristol.

Emily tucked into a chicken nugget meal with a coke, while Steven had the Chicken Legend meal with a strawberry milkshake.

The couple were treated to a bottle of champagne by fast food bosses - but had to make do with soft drinks at McDonald's because of its alcohol ban.

Steven, 28, and Emily, 21, are familiar faces at the restaurant and dine there twice a week when they can afford it.

The pair decided to celebrate the start of their new life together at McDonald's, because they wanted to make it 'as memorable as possible'.

Stephen, who works at a warehouse for a chilled food company, today described it as 'the happiest day of our lives'.

He said: 'When I saw Emily in her dress for the first time I couldn't believe my eyes, she looked absolutely beautiful.

'We were both shaking throughout the ceremony, we were so nervous.

'But it was a great day and everyone seemed to find our reception at McDonald's really interesting.

'Everyone enjoyed themselves - everyone loves McDonald's don't they?"

Emily ate a chicken nugget meal with a coke, while Steven tucked into a Chicken Legend meal with a strawberry milkshake.

After spending £150 on food, they held their alcoholic toasts at the Avonmouth Working Men's Club after the reception.

The couple, who currently live with 
Emily's father in Bristol, met a year ago after a mutual friend asked 
Steven to drive the 21-year-old home after a night out.

Steven proposed six months later after a string of dates at McDonald's.

They tied the knot at Bristol Register Office on Saturday, before arriving at the reception in a hired limousine.

Blushing bride Emily, 21, added: 'It was an amazing day. I did get quite a few people staring at me in McDonald's, but I didn't care - it was my big day and I was there to enjoy myself.

'Some people were taking pictures of me in my dress which I found funny.

'The ceremony was lovely and all the guests seemed to enjoy the reception so I was happy.'

The McDonald's reception was the idea of Emily's mum and the couple jumped at the chance.

Emily, who is a full-time mum to her two-year-old daughter Lily-Rae, said she was not bothered about what people think.

She added: 'One of my friends sent me a message on Facebook saying, "Are you mad?", but it's just something that we really like..

'I'm not worried about people staring at me. You're meant to be the centre of attention on your wedding day, aren't you?'
