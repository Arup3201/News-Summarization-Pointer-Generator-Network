It turned out that all we were ever going to discover in Sao Paulo is who might be the better of two moderate World Cup teams.

England almost claimed that modest accolade with a second-half performance born of desperation. Then that porous left side of their defence leaked yet again and the impossible comeback of Luis Suarez materialised into all too complete a resurrection.

Yet it seems inconceivable that the winners of a tournament bursting at the seams with brilliant goals and dazzling football might come out of a match like this.

Deadly: Uruguay striker Luis Suarez celebrates after scoring the winner against England

Strange things do happen, of course. Like Italy starting like a broken down old van at Spain '82 and roaring through the finishing line like a Ferrari.

But while champions do tend to grow the longer they last during a World Cup, they don't usually begin as short of stature as England or Uruguay.

Despite this result it still remains unclear whether either of them will make it as far as the last 16. Roy Hodgson chose to shuffle the pack rather than change any cards.

That left us to work out whether the manager, along with most of the nation, had been reading too many positives into a losing performance.

Maybe so, because we still don't really know how good are Italy. And with that wonderful gift of hind-sight I have to say they did not appear as potent as the Azzurri counter-attackers of World Cups past.

But for sure Uruguay were hopeless against Costa Rica.

Without Suarez they were not a patch on the other South Americans. With him, they gave Joe Hart some collywobbles in England's goal. Thanks to the miracle of the wounded knee he gave them the lead

Finally, unbelievably, he scored their winner.

How long and how far he might carry Uruguay on one-and-a-half legs is another matter entirely.

The comparison with Wayne Rooney was close to becoming embarrassing for two thirds of the night.

The awkward question of how soon, if ever, Rooney might score his first World Cup finals goal remained unanswered with more than another hour of endeavour elapsed. 

He hits the bar. He hits the keeper. He scratches his head.

So close: Rooney shot straight at the goalkeeper when he found space in the penalty area

Hodgson had given him his rightful place in the middle, albeit without improving the balance in midfield. But it all seemed worth it when that tap-in came.

Just 24 hours earlier Vicente Del Bosque had paid the penalty for excessive loyalty to his preferred players. There is an element of that now for Hodgson.

But the difference here of course is that England, as they try to build for a better future while still trying to put on a good show in this World Cup, do not yet possess Spain's strength in squad depth.

Tussle: England's Steven Gerrard challenges Edinson Cavani of Uruguay

Was Adam Lallana as much of an improvement on Danny Welbeck as Ross Barkley might be? Would Frank Lampard be better than Jordan Henderson?

And most citically and contentiously of all, if age is catching up with the captain, has the time come for Steven Gerrard to hand over the flag of experience to Frank Lampard?

After this deathly struggle, we might as well find out against Costa Rica.

After all, what more do Roy’s boys have to lose?

Only another football match.
