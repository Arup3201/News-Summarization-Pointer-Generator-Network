It’s not every day a politician gets the backing of MC Hammer, one of the Black Eyed Peas, a Google senior executive, a YouTube director and one of the founders of Twitter - all in one amazing video.

But San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee will be a happy man after receiving the support of an incredible array of celebrities, performing a ‘2 Legit 2 Quit’ song.

The advert, which is not sponsored by the mayor, tells voters to ‘Fear the Moustache’. It's a play on ‘Fear the Beard’, the slogan of San Francisco Giants pitcher Brian Wilson, who also features.

Endorsement: The advert, which is not sponsored by the mayor, tells voters to 'Fear the Moustache', and features an array of celebrities - including will.i.am from the Black Eyed Peas

Aaron McLear - of the San Franciscans for Jobs and Good Government group, which made the video - told the San Francisco Chronicle: ‘It’s an endorsement - but it’s a totally innovative way to do it.’

The independent group is led by Silicon Valley investor Ron Conway, and the video also features former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, Marissa Mayer of Google and YouTube’s Hunter Walk.

Ms Mayer is well-known in part for hosting President Barack Obama at her home in Palo Alto, California, last year, and she is also joined in the video by Twitter co-founder Biz Stone.

The song is based on rapper MC Hammer's hit 'Too Legit to Quit' from 1991, and features memorable lines such as: ‘Thank you, for blessing me / And the rest of the city with Mayor Ed Lee’.

Other lines include: ‘Got us all saying – “Run Lee Run” / only 5ft5 but he get s**t done’ and ‘So tell them other candidates to find a bus pass / Unless you riding with us - fear the moustache’.

The endorsement has come because the technology industry wants to remind voters that Mayor Lee has backed their growth and job creation in San Francisco, Mr McLear said.

He added that voters are more likely to be reached by this sort of YouTube viral advertisement, rather than through the post or on television.

In addition, the video cost the group just $18,000 to make – compared to a television advert that might cost around $200,000 a week to air – because all the stars involved did it for free.
