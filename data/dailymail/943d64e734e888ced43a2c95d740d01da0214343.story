Donor: David Ross, 48, co-founder of Carphone Warehouse and a friend of David Cameron, is understood to be a leading candidate

A multi-millionaire Tory donor yesterday emerged as a front-runner to take over schools watchdog Ofsted.

David Ross, 48, co-founder of Carphone Warehouse and a friend of David Cameron, is understood to be a leading candidate.

He has advised the Conservatives on education policy and used part of his £892million fortune to set up 25 academy schools. 

But any move by Education Secretary Michael Gove to install him as Ofsted chairman could prove highly controversial.

Labour sources warned the appointment of a major donor to the crucial post would raise questions about whether the recruitment process was ‘open and transparent’.

Mr Gove came under fire when he sacked Labour supporter Baroness Morgan, the outgoing chairman of Ofsted, earlier this year.

Mr Ross has given £230,000 to the Conservative Party since 2006. But he has hit the headlines as often for his glamorous girlfriends as for his political involvement.

Born in Grimsby to the wealthy family behind Ross Frozen Foods, he was educated privately at Uppingham School, where he met his future business partner, Charles Dunstone.

They set up Carphone Warehouse in 1989 with an investment of £6,000. Today it is worth around £1.8billion.

His girlfriends have included rugby player Will Carling’s ex-fiancee Ali Cockayne, Ralph Lauren muse Saffron Aldridge and former model Shelley Ross, with whom he has a son. He left Carphone Warehouse in 2008 and now dedicates much of his time to good causes through the David Ross Foundation and the David Ross Education Trust.

He is one of a number of candidates being considered by Mr Gove for Ofsted chairman, Sky News said yesterday. Other names mooted for the role include Theodore Agnew, who is chairman of the Department for Education’s academies board and has given £144,000 to the Tories.

Labour sources voiced concerns that Ofsted, whose current chief inspector is Sir Michael Wilshaw, could become too politicised.

A spokesman said: ‘If a major Tory donor was to receive a senior role like this, people would want full assurances that the recruitment process has been open and transparent. Without this, motivations behind the appointment would inevitably be brought into question.’ A Lib Dem source added: ‘The chair of Ofsted should be appointed based on their ability and suitability for the role, not . . . their political outlook.’

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘An independent panel decides who is long-listed, short-listed and interviewed.

‘After this process is complete, they recommend to ministers a list.’

A spokesman for Mr Ross declined to comment, while education sources last night played down suggestions he is a shoo-in. A source stressed Mr Ross put himself forward and would be one of ‘a number of names’.
