The lesbian waitress who claimed that she was left a bigoted note may have lied again as a charity has still not received a donation that she announced she was making.

Dayna Morales kicked up a firestorm after telling a gay advocacy group that she was left a homophobic note by a family that she waited on who  instead of a tip.

The family later said she was making it up, but that hasn't stopped 22-year-old Morales from collecting tips from other customers who were eager to make up for what they believed was a real insult.

Some good, finally: Dayna Morales has begun refunding well-wishers who donated around $3,000 to her after hearing her outrageous tale

She later said that she would donate the 'replacement tips' that she had received since the ordeal to the Wounded Warrior Project, a charity that helps injured soldiers.

Now the charity has told the local Patch site in Bridgewater, New Jersey that they have not been able to find any donations from anyone in the area near her home address- meaning that they would be able to find it whether or not she used her name or remained anonymous.

The only other way that the donation could have been made without it being searchable is through an unidentified third party or in a different zip code.

She first announced that the donation- the amount of which remained undisclosed- was going to Wounded Warriors because of her own personal military service as a Marine, but that has also been called into question.

Upset: Dayna Morales, pictured left while a 
marine and right, said she was offended and hurt by how the couple, with
 two small children, treated her while she served them but the family denied her claims

While Morales did serve in the Marines Corps reserve from July 2009 to May 2013, thereâ€™s no indication in her record of any combat service in Afghanistan or Iraq.

The donation issue is just the latest in a string of lies that have been unearthed, as MailOnline previously interviewed one of Morales' friends who told a number of the 22-year-old's other tall tales.

Kiersten Lynn Bremer, 23, from Washingtonville, New York, said she met Morales in November 2011 when she got engaged to one of her best friends, Teresa Rivera.

Proof? The controversial receipt (left) shows exactly the same price, time and date of the meal as the family's copy (right) - but does not have the $18 tip the family swear they left bringing the total to $111.55

'We hit it off from the start and I never had such a good a connection from a girl ever. My husband and I left her stay the night at our house so many times.'

'But then things started coming up - she started saying things about how she was once pregnant and the baby died. She claimed she was blown up in her tank in Afghanistan. She said everybody else in the platoon were killed - so there were no other witnesses. We just soaked it all up.'
