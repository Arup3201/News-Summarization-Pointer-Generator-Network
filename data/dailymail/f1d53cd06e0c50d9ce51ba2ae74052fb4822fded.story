Dashboard cameras are more commonly used for documenting car crashes, accidents and crimes, but one Youtube user has uploaded a series of goof deeds captured on the devices.

The video, which was uploaded by ArkadiYM93, features a series of kind acts by good Samaritans in Russia.

It has since gone viral, amassing more than 880,000 viewings in just a one day.

Dashboard cameras are common in Russia as they help tackle insurance fraud by helping innocent people, the police and insurance firms.

They have shown everything from plane crashes to meteorites, but never before have they been so heartwarming.

The video says at the start, according to a translation by Huffington Post:

Many of the videos show kind strangers helping the elderly cross the road

A motorist left his car to help a nervous elderly woman who was struggling to cross the road

A pedestrian who is using crutches falls in the middle of the road and struggles to get back up

The driver stops his car and helps the man get back on to his feet

‘The world isn't without good people.

‘Any act can become one of great kindness if it is done selflessly.

‘When was the last time you did a good deed?’

The video aims to show the best aspects of humanity, featuring motorists helping the elderly cross busy roads, men helping push cars from snowy ditches, and people waiting for animals to get to safety before continuing to drive.

One shocking clip shows a man leave his car to help a young infant who is wandering across a busy road.

The video has had a very positive response on the website as Youtube users expressed their gratitude to ArkadiYM93.
