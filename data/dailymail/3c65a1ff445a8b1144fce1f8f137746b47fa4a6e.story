A firefighter in Los Angeles and his elderly mother are on trial over the brutal beating of a woman they say was feeding stray cats in their neighborhood.

Prosecutors say that Lonieta Fontaine, 70, and her son Ian Eulian, 37, wanted the local cat lady to stop feeding the gang of felines near their home in South Los Angeles, KABC reported. 

The woman refused — and the mother-duo son knocked her out unconscious, beating her to the pavement in a shocking attack that was captured by a surveillance camera.

Eulian — who once tried to become 'America's Fittest Firefighters' in a Men's Health magazine contest — is seen in the footage pummeling the woman and pulling her from her car. His mother appears to slap her.

'He said that they were pooping in 
his backyard and that they attacked his dog,' victim Rebecca Stafford, 47, told KABC.

'It got hostile and then I 
got punched and knocked out,' she told the station. 'I woke up a little while later. I didn't 
remember really what happened.'

When Stafford regained consciousness, Fontaine and Eulian then brazenly tried to convince the victim that she'd simply had an accident, she says.

'They told me I tripped, fell and hit my head on my car,' Stafford told the station

She only realized what happened when she reviewed the footage from a nearby camera.

'I cried —  It was really hard to watch,' she told KABC.

Victim: Rebecca Stafford says she was attacked because she refused to stop feeding neighborhood cats

Food? A stray cat that likely used to be fed by Stafford roams the South Los Angeles neighborhood where the attack happened

Eulian is on administrative leave from the Los Angeles Fire Department. He is charged with battery causing serious bodily injury, according to KABC. His mother is charged with accessory after the fact.

Defense attorneys say Stafford was 'belligerent' and threw cat food in Eulian's face, KABC reported.

'She was angry, she was hostile,' Eulian's defense attorney told KABC.

The incident happened in September 2013 but the video was only released recently during the duo's trial.
