Life's little luxuries: simon Cowell insist on only black toilet paper in his bathrooms, according to a new book

With the upcoming release of the unauthorised Simon Cowell biography, more details of the X Factor supremo's quirky home habits are being unveiled.

From the whopping £3000 a week on floral arrangements to the colonic irrigations and vitamin intravenous drips, the 52-year-old isn't afraid to splash the cash on life's little luxuries.

Perhaps most bizarrely, it has been claimed that Cowell insists that only luxury black toilet paper is placed in the many bathrooms of his London and Los Angeles homes.

The loo paper sets the music mogul back approximately £10 a roll.

Additionally,
the book claims that Cowell travels with suitcases full of creams, bath
products and lotions to counteract ageing, takes 'saucers full' of 
tablets daily and undergoes routine Botox injections.

The
revelations keep coming as Cowell's publicist Max Clifford told This 
Morning that he'd advised his client to not speak to the book's author 
Tom Bower.

But he added: 'you have got one or two stories, there are 100 you haven't got, and hopefully you won't have.'

Clifford is concerned about a string of Cowell's ex-lovers who are threatening to come forward with their own tales.

'It's open season,' Clifford told This Morning. 'Yesterday six different girls called my office who supposedly have had relationships with Simon.

Fancy: The loo roll can cost up to £10 a roll

'I’m sure loads of girls will be 
contacting newspapers, many of whom have probably never met him or just 
had a picture taken with him. That will happen because of the Tom Bower 
book.'

Clifford told Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby that he had been responsible for keeping Simon's affair with Dannii Minogue out of the papers for years.

'Both of them didn’t want it to come out so I was happy to make sure it didn’t happen, and up until the book it didn’t happen.'

Cowell and Minogue had a secret fling during Dannii's first season on the X Factor. Cowell confirmed the romance, according to the book's author Tom Bower.

Backtracking: Despite saying Gary Barlow was 'too scripted', Cowell has been forced to issue a statement announcing his pleasure at the singer being the first X Factor judge to return for next season

Do you think Simon Cowell and Dannii Minogue made a good couple?

Simon has had to backtrack on another
of his X Factor judges this week, after Gary Barlow was yesterday 
confirmed to return to programme.

This
news came shortly after it was revealed that Cowell wanted to fire the 
Take That star for being 'too scripted' and 'a bit stiff' last season.

The
quotes were credited to Cowell in Sweet Revenge: The Intimate Life of 
Simon Cowell, but he was whistling a different tune yesterday after the 
announcement that Gary is returning.

Cowell
said: 'It's great to be able to confirm our first judge this year's 
show. Gary has earned his place and I'm excited to be working with him 
again.'
