Hundreds of migrants waiting to be kicked out of Calais have had their deadline for leaving extended.

Authorities accepted an argument by charities looking after them in an emergency compound that it would be ‘inhuman’ to force them out when they have nowhere else to go.

The midday cut-off was shifted to allow a further 48 hours for organising departure.

It is thought the decision was made after it became clear that most of the several hundred would-be asylum seekers in the town would simply find shelter a short walk away – and would continue their daily bids to smuggle themselves into Britain.

No deterrent: Migrants try their luck to jump onto lorries making their way out of Calais. The Syrian men stroll off after being caught

escape to Britain after being told to clear the port of Calais by tomorrow

Desperate: Migrants push against a steel barrier as their camp in Calais disappears before their eyes

The French
 port has for years been a magnet for people from the Middle East and 
Africa in search of a new life.

Up to 1,000 were displaced on Wednesday 
when three squalid campsites that have blighted the town for months were
 bulldozed.

Yesterday
 a worker at the Salam organisation acting for migrants in Calais, said 
officials ‘can’t just tell them to go and squat somewhere’, adding: 
‘That’s not a solution. Hopefully we will find one over the weekend.’

Earlier, the looming deadline to evacuate the camps prompted a last minute rush to cross the Channel. Groups wandered around the ferry port, trying to smuggle themselves on lorries.

Those who succeed will take the first opportunity to leap out in England – as evidenced by migrants covered in flour after climbing out of a food tanker on the M25.

In France, we watched as police pulled three Syrians from the back of a truck – and simply let them go. One of the trio laughed as he told me he would ‘try, try and try again’.

Groups were said to be arming themselves with sticks and rocks to re-populate the ‘Jungle’ area outside Calais, a camp cleared by police five years ago after months of lawlessness that saw a British journalist raped.

The crackdown is designed to rid Calais of the blight caused by up to 1,000 migrants, forced from their squalid camps on Wednesday.

Charities fed hundreds overnight in an open air compound, but it will close today.

One Afghan – his feet crunching eggshell 
fragments from the previous night’s meal – told me he was forced to risk
 his life to get to Britain.

The 19-year-old added: ‘I have no home. I have no money. I have no choice.’

In seven hours in Calais, photographer Roland Hoskins and I repeatedly witnessed individuals or groups scouring the port for a security glitch that might win them passage to Britain.

Every lorry was scrutinised; even families in UK cars were reportedly pestered for a lift.

Police blocked a road to the Jungle, warning: ‘They’re picking up stones to throw. You don’t want to be there right now.’

The bulldozing of the migrant camp has left many refugees unsure of where to head next - though many are trying to escape to the UK

Nearby, seven young men from Ethiopia and Eritrea said they had been repeatedly beaten by police, who used pepper-spray.

Hussein Sultan, 23, a former hospital nurse from Oromia, Ethiopia, said gendarmes bundled him into a car, drove him 30 miles out of Calais and dumped him by the roadside.

He took two days to walk back. Yesterday he and six friends were headed for the Jungle. All agreed they would ‘never give up’.

In drizzling rain, hundreds made their way to the ‘feeding station’ compound to get what might be a last supper.

Denis Robin, prefect for the Pas de Calais, said migrants must leave the compound today.

He said scabies and ‘deplorable hygiene’ had forced the destruction of camps. Border guards reported dozens hiding in shrubs along roads, often attempting to cling to lorries. They regularly risk death. A Sudanese migrant died last week after trying to hide under the axle of a British coach in a car park.

Once in the UK they may claim asylum, and so generous benefits; or they may simply disappear into the black economy.

Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart has long argued Britain’s ‘generous welfare system’ is behind the migrant crisis in her town.

Referring to international treaties governing the treatment of migrants, Miss Bouchart said: ‘Calais is a hostage to the British. That’s enough. It’s no longer tenable.’
