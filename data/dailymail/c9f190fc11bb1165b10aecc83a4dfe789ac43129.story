Tracking down the name of Captain Francis Mount on the Loos Memorial takes some time.

It isn’t surprising. There are more than 20,000 names on the Portland stone memorial, kept in immaculate condition by gardeners from the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.

Today, the Commission’s stonemasons are replacing a worn panel with a newly-inscribed, pristine one. And there are thousands more gravestones in other cemeteries in this mining area, just outside Lens in north-eastern France.

Bond: Prime Minster David Cameron and Harry Mount, second cousins, look at a memorial to their great-uncle, Francis Mount

More than 59,000 Allied soldiers - and 20,000 Germans - were killed in the Battle of Loos in the autumn of 1915.

Poor Francis Mount was one of the last of them, killed on the final day of the Battle of Loos - a military tragedy, with all those lives lost in exchange for a mere two miles of blood-soaked earth gained.

Francis Mount was my great-great uncle. I share him with my second cousin, David Cameron.

The battle he fought in at Loos marks the first time the Allies used poison gas. It was a disaster. Once released, it was blown back by the winds over friendly lines and killed many Allied soldiers.

The supposed ‘Big Push’ failed at Loos and it led to Sir John French, Commander of the British Expeditionary Force, being replaced by Field Marshal Douglas Haig.

Even with the sun blazing down on the memorial, your mind is drawn back to the freezing gloom and bloody slaughter of World War I.

‘Seeing the memorial to a relation helps to bring it all home and make the connections,’ says the Prime Minister, who is on his third trip to the Western Front in a year.

In December, he visited the memorial to another great-great uncle, John Geddes, who died at Ypres in April 1915. Five members of Cameron’s family were killed in the war.

‘It helps to put you in their shoes at their age at their time,’ he explains. ‘I find it very moving. It has such pathos.

‘The commemorations have brought it even closer. But there’s something about the First World War.

'There’s some extra factor which makes it incredibly powerful. There was the scale of the slaughter of course. It’s the inexplicable nature - that the slaughter just went on and on. You can’t get away from it.’

Early yesterday, Cameron attended the World War I Centenary service at Glasgow Cathedral with the Prince of Wales.

He was given a poppy which he laid, alongside a cross, in the earth beneath his great-great uncle’s name at the Loos Memorial later in the day. I placed another cross next to it. Francis Mount’s body was never recovered - so there is no tombstone to him. 

'Just war': Mr Cameron insisted that the soldiers who died in the First World War were fighting for good reason

‘Men like Francis Mount went to fight because they believed they were going to fight a just war,’ says Cameron, ‘They were right to think that.’

Although Cameron was born more than half a century after the death of Francis Mount, he has strong links to him.

Francis Mount, the son of the Conservative MP for Newbury, was brought up at Wasing Place, Berkshire, where Cameron’s mother, Mary Mount, was later brought up.

As a boy, Cameron went to services in Wasing Church, where his parents married and his grandfather, Sir William Mount, a D-Day veteran, is buried.

‘My grandfather never talked about the First World War or the Second,’ says the Prime Minister, ‘But I remember at his funeral [in 1993], when people came in uniform from miles away. This year, going to the Normandy beaches made me think a lot about my grandfather.

Walking the graves: Mr Cameron has more relatives who fought in the Wars, including a great-great uncle who fell at Ypres and his D-Day veteran grandfather

‘He taught me how to fish and all sorts of things about the countryside. But he never talked about the war. My mother said he never would. He was wounded on Normandy and he never talked about it again. It was classic British reserve.

‘That’s one of the reasons I’ve wanted to rediscover these connections with Francis Mount - because my grandfather never talked about it.’

Francis Mount was one of the older soldiers at the Front. He was 43 with a wife and two young sons.

He was commissioned in the 5th Battalion of the Royal Berkshire Regiment, an infantry regiment, and arrived with his battalion at the end of May 1915 at Boulogne.

Once at Loos, Mount survived the first days of the battle. He survived the tragic moment when the Allies gassed themselves.

He survived the day the British advanced in open country into the raking fire of German machine-guns: a single German machine-gun fired 12,500 rounds that day.

But he did not survive that fatal last day of the Battle of Loos - October 13, 1915. In that final, desperate, Allied attempt to topple the Germans, Francis Mount was killed.

‘Despite the horror of his death, and millions more, I do not believe the First World War was just pointless slaughter,’ says David Cameron. ‘There was a purpose.

‘There were ways the war could have been shortened, or should have been pursued differently.

'But the fundamental reason why Britain went to war in 1914 was that there was a just cause. We had promised to guarantee Belgian neutrality.

‘It’s right to celebrate the bravery.’

Cameron still sees echoes of the war running through modern politics.

‘There is a right for a small country not to be bullied when it’s overrun by its neighbours,’ says Cameron, ‘In the case of the war, it was Belgium; but, in our own times, you can make that argument about Kuwait, Ukraine. It still has a relevance - the territorial inviolability of states.’

‘The seminal event of our lifetime was the fall of the Berlin Wall or the collapse of the Soviet Union. But you need to go back to World War I to see how the break-up of these empires started to affect the world in which we now live.’

Poignant: Yesterday Mr Cameron joined members of the Royal family including Princes Charles and William and the Duchess of Cambridge, seen above, at a memorial service in Belgium

Cameron sees nothing jingoistic in commemorating the heroism of Mount and millions more like him. ‘We’re a very patriotic, proud nation. We want these things to be properly commemorated. We have to mark the key moments in the war, too - the Somme, Passchendaele, Gallipoli, Jutland.’

Just before he spoke these words, Cameron passed the memorial to another captain killed at Loos on the same day as Captain Mount - Charles Hamilton Sorley, a 20-year-old war poet, shot in the head by a sniper. After his death, his final poem was unearthed in his kit bag:

‘When you see millions of the mouthless dead / Across your dreams in pale battalions go / Say not soft things as other men have said / That you’ll remember. For you need not so.’

With all due respect to the noble poet captain, we need to remember. And we do.
