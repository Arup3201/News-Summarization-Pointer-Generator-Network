The Brooklyn Nets on Tuesday confirmed that it was entertaining offers for the sale of the NBA club, saying it was 'always open' to overtures, but added no deal was imminent.

Reports say that Russian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov has retained Evercore Partners to sell the National Basketball Association team he bought in 2010 for £146 million.

'As we have said for many months, ownership is always open to listening to offers - that's just good business,' a spokeswoman for Prokhorov said to Reuters in an email.

The Nets made a move from New Jersey to Brooklyn in 2012, and reportedly lost £95m last season

'There is nothing imminent in terms of a sale of any stake in the team.'

Prokhorov, 49, the first foreign owner of an NBA team, holds 80 percent of the club and 45 percent of their state-of-the-art Barclays Center home. The Nets lost a reported £95 million last season.

The Nets made the move from New Jersey to Brooklyn in time for the 2012-13 season and owner Prokhorov has been desperate for NBA success.
