It showed a disappearing feature of the British landscape - and even included 'glamour' spots of Wales.

But it would appear that even with that enticing sell, the 'Fast Disappearing Red Telephone Boxes of Wales 2014' failed to lure in buyers.

The calendar has failed to sell a single copy - with just 41 days until the New Year.

And even the publisher admitted some people found it 'naff, nerdy and boring' - but he hoped there was a specialist interest on old phone boxes.

The allure of chipped phone boxes in the calendar has failed to draw in a single customer since it went on sale

Publisher Kevin Beresford, 61, was responsible for unlikely seasonal hit Roundabouts of Great Britain 2012 - and was hoping to repeat his success.

But he admitted he might have misjudged their target market with his latest 'niche' calender.

The Fast Disappearing Red Telephone Boxes of Wales 2014 - priced at £9.99 - features 12 months of dilapidated boxes.

But it has failed to shift a single copy since going on sale in September.

The calender features phone boxes in Welsh 'glamour spots' including Monmouth, Llanberis and Gilwern.

The iconic phone boxes - largely unused - sit in overgrown grass or crisp winter snow - one is in front of a graveyard .

They have 'unique features' including chipped paint, broken glass, graffiti and signings warning 'coins not accepted here'

Even with the inclusion of ducks and graveyards featuring in the calendar, consumers have not been persuaded to part with £9.99 for the photographs

In
its advertising it says; 'We must immediately seek out and record the 
most iconic phone boxes on the planet before they all become extinct.

'Government cuts, neglect, vandalism, lack of investment and mobile cell phones have all lead to the sad demise of these revered, scarlet solid structures of communication.

'All of our lives they have been with us.

'Reassuring, comforting, well built, weather-proof, iconic, dependable, indestructible......until now!

'In the not too distant future our grandchildren will find this calendar in their attic or cellar (do we still have those?) scratch their heads and think....what did people do inside those things?'

But not a copy has been bought - with One Direction and Cliff Richard calendars are leading sales ahead of the New Year.

Disappointed Kevin said: 'We now feel the need to confess and state, we may have crossed a boring bridge too far.

'But, are we not all fed up with David Beckham, six-pack fireman, Lady Ga-Ga, One Direction and dare I say Cliff Richard?

People seem more interested in peeling back the months of Cliff Richard's sporty calendar than phone boxes in Wales

Buyers appear more willing to pin up the One Direction boys then have the phone boxes adorn their homes

'We have created a calendar that is considered to be so hum-drum, so naff, so nerdy, so dull, so parochial that not even the most patriotic Welsh person wants to buy a copy.

'In short we have not sold one calendar and we are past mid-November in the shopping-run up to Christmas.'

Frustrated Kevin added: 'Looking at the front cover with a somewhat dilapidated red telephone box, coupled with two strutting Mallard ducks in the obscure town of Talybon.

'On Usk, maybe I can somewhat understand the lack of interest amongst the paying public out there.

Businessman Kevin, of Redditch, near Birmingham, started making calenders in 2003.

He had a huge hit with 12 roundabouts in Redditch - which sold 100,000 worldwide - but his best seller is a road kill calender.

Kevin, who runs the Roundabout Appreciation Society, has also made calendars featuring prisons, graveyards and hospitals.

Kevin added: 'We pride ourselves on capturing slices of British life in calendar form that most people wouldn't take the time to appreciate.

'Case in point are our wonderful Roundabout Calendars which sell all around the world.

'People now look upon these amazing round pieces of road-architecture and see them in a new light, an oasis on a sea of tarmac so to speak.'

But the 'stunning and unique Welsh calendar' which went on the market in September has now flopped.
