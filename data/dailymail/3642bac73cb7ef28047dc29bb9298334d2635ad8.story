Another suspected jihadist has been able to leave the country using his brother's passport, in an embarrassing blunder for Sydney border security.

A 19-year-old man from Kellyville in Sydney's west was able to leave Sydney airport last week on his brother's passport, boarding a plane for the United Arab Emirates.

It is believed he was going to join jihadist fighters in the Middle East.

The blunder is reminiscent of the security lapse that allowed Khaled Sharrouf, the terrorist currently fighting with jihadists in Syria who has posted horrifying photographs of himself and his seven-year-old son holding up decapitated heads to social media, to leave the country.

He departed Sydney airport last December using the passport of his brother Mostafa Sharrouf.

The 19-year-old Kellyville man was arrested by police upon arrival in the United Arab Emirates and deported to Australia, where he was met by Federal Police, reported The Daily Telegraph.

He faced court on Wednesday where he faced was charged with using a passport not issued to him, but he was not charged with any terrorism-related crimes.

The man, who is believed to come from Afghanistan, remains in custody and has not applied for bail.

His case has been adjourned until October.

It is believed that up to 150 Australians are currently fighting in Iraqi and Syrian warzones.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott yesterday visited Australian forces in the United Arab Emirates, who are involved in dropping aid into northern Iraq as part of an international humanitarian effort.
