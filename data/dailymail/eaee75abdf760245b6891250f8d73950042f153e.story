From a dainty pair of stiletto shoes to an electric guitar and even an innocuous jar of pickled cucumbers - these seemingly innocent objects are in fact the world's weirdest murder weapons.

Photographer Ed James has compiled a striking collection of photos featuring 10 seemingly ordinary items that were all used in real-life murders.

The 43-year-old says that the images are meant to unsettle and provoke and should make people uneasy yet curious. 

Well heeled: A 44-year-old Texas woman stabbed her boyfriend to death with a five-and-a-half-inch stiletto heel

He explained: 'This set of ten images show the strange and sometimes bizarre items that people have used to kill with.

'I wanted each item to be unusually lit and out of context to mirror the way that the killers used them. The work should make people uneasy yet intrigued.'

Mr James says that although the subject is a dark one, he would like to think that the final images reflect the opposite of what the object was used for.

He said he found an array of horrifying cases, but chose not to identify the names of the perpetrators.

Snack attack: A 16-year-old Ohio male murdered a 55-year-old man by smashing him over the head with a jar of pickled cucumbers

'I did not want to use names as these were all real crimes I thought that a brief description of place, age & sex would be appropriate.'

'The objects are not the actual murder weapons that were used, I wanted to just use clean everyday objects & thought that this would best illustrate there bizarre use.

The photographer who lives in Athens, Georgia says his favourite kind of photography is anything with an idea or concept that is executed in an interesting way.

'Being an Advertising photographer for 18 years I have always been involved in ideas. I just wanted to think of something that was not so commercial. 

So starting with the fact that most of what I do is still life based I thought of objects, then alternative ways to use objects whilst online I found some articles on murders that had been committed with 'strange' weapons.

'As I researched it I found more so decided to shoot a series on these bizarre murder weapons. I then photographed them in the studio. I wanted each object to be unusually lit and out of context to mirror the way that the killers used them.'

The photographer says that he used to split his time between London and New York, and still travels to the big apple for much of his commercial photography.

After leaving school at 16, he went to work on a building site. However Ed's interest in photography began after he quit his job as a roofer.

'Someone I was working with turned to me a said that I should go back to school and do something I have a thirst for knowledge for. 

'I always liked art in school and decided to take a foundation course, from there I went on to a full time course studying photography film and television for five years.'
