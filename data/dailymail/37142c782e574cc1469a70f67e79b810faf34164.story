Shock: Harper Collins announced on Tuesday that Harper Lee, pictured here in 2007 at the White House, is publishing a book she set aside some 50 years ago

Harper Lee is blind, deaf and largely confined to a wheelchair, so how did the legendary To Kill a Mockingbird author suddenly okay a new book for publication over 55 years after she wrote it?

That's the question on the minds of her neighbors in tiny Monroeville, Alabama and fans alike now that Lee's publisher has revealed they've had zero conversations with her about the mysterious new book Go Set a Watchman.

The undoubtedly massive deal was revealed just three months after the death of Lee's fiercely protective attorney sister by her literary agent and sister's successor.

That sister, Alice Lee, who died in November at 103, told a reporter before her death that her sister--who had a stroke in 2007--'can't see and can't hear and will sign anything put before her by anyone in whom she has confidence.'

Harper publisher Jonathan Burnham acknowledged Tuesday that the publisher has had no direct conversations about the new book with Harper Lee, but communicated through her Monroeville attorney, Tonja Carter, and literary agent Andrew Nurnburg.

The publisher says Carter came upon the manuscript at a 'secure location where it had been affixed to an original typescript of To Kill a Mockingbird.

Burnham said during a telephone interview that he had known both Carter and Nurnburg for years and was 'completely confident' Lee was fully involved in the decision to release the book.

'We've had a great deal of communication with Andrew and Tonja,' said Burnham, adding that Nurnburg had met with her recently and found her 'feisty and in very fine spirits.'

But, per the New York Times, Nurnburg also described Lee as 'a bit diffident at first and said, Is this really worth publishing right now?' as she voiced to him her reservations about the new book.

In the small Alabama town  Lee made famous with To Kill a Mockingbird, the Southern classic novel can be seen and felt everywhere.

Signs in Monroeville are decorated with mockingbirds. The old courthouse, a model for the movie version of the book, is now a museum that sells souvenirs including coffee cups, aprons and Christmas ornaments. A statue in the town square and a mural decorating the side of a building depict characters who inhabited a fictional version of the town Lee called 'Maycomb, Alabama.'

After the shock announcement of Lee's new book, her publisher at Harper (headquarter at right) revealed they'd had no direct contact with the author about the deal. The publisher dealt only with the disabled 88-year-old's literary agent Andrew Nurnberg (left with Camilla Duchess of Cornwall) and new attorney Tonja Carter

Harper Lee spent most of her life avoiding the spotlight following the massive success of he first and only novel To Kill a Mockingbird.

So, less than three months since the death of her sharp-as-a-tack lifelong confidante sister Alice, should the public be suspicious of news the recluse is suddenly releasing a novel she penned in the 1950s? 

The 88-year-old author has reportedly been in ill health since 2007, when she suffered a stroke that left her wheelchair-bound, nearly deaf and blind and unable to live on her own. 

Protector: Harper Lee's older sister Alice ran the family law firm for some 40 years before finally retiring at 100, having remained all that time her sister's staunch defender and protector 

Lee is now represented by Tonja Carter, who succeeded Alice in the family firm. 

According to Gawker, 'Lee has a history of signing whatever's put in front of her, apparently sometimes with Carter's advice.'

Carter has a history of going after apparent infringements of copyrights held by Lee, even once going after a business owner in Lee's beloved hometown of Monroeville, Alabama who was selling merchandise that capitalized on her name and that of her novel.

Alice Lee, who spent decades protecting her little sister from the spotlight, died last year at the age of 103. 

With a new Harper Lee book being released just months after her attorney sister  (pictured) Alice's death, some are questioning whether the publication is the wish of Harper Lee--who's been nearly deaf and blind since a stroke left her wheelchair-bound in 2007--or of someone else

So when it was announced she had another book to be released this summer, Monroeville residents and visitors alike were pleased and excited — but they were also perplexed.

The first book centered on small-town attorney Atticus Finch, his children Scout and Jem, and racial injustice in the Jim Crow South. The new book, 'Go Set a Watchman,' is described as a sequel that Lee actually wrote in the 1950s before 'To Kill a Mockingbird.'

One of the most beloved novels in history, Lee's original novel has sold over 40 million copies. But it was written after the upcoming book

'I was really surprised,' said Jillian Schultz, 28, who owns a business in the town square. 'You know there's a lot of controversy about whether Harper Lee actually wrote the (first) book. There's been so many years in between, and you have to wonder, 'How did somebody forget about a book?''

Located halfway between Montgomery and Mobile, Monroeville calls itself the 'Literary Capital of Alabama,' a designation bestowed by the state Legislature in the late 1990s. Besides Lee, the city was home to novelist Truman Capote and Pulitzer Prize-winning editorialist Cynthia Tucker.

For years, the town of 6,300 was known as the home of a huge Vanity Fair mill and outlet, but the factory shut down nearly 20 years ago. That left Monroeville with 'Mockingbird' and its literary heritage to attract visitors off the nearest highway, Interstate 65, about 25 miles away.

The nonprofit Monroe County Heritage Museum opens the old courthouse to visitors and features a display about Lee's life in her own words. Fans can sit in the courtroom balcony depicted in the Academy Award-winning screen version of the book.

Area residents put on a play based on the book each spring, holding the first act of sold-out performances on the courthouse lawn, then taking patrons inside for the climactic courtroom scenes. While visitors are few in shops right now, they'll return once winter is over.

'It will be busy again during the play,' Schultz said.

Visitors likely won't see the 88-year-old Lee, who lived in New York for years but now resides in an assisted living center not far from where she grew up. A longtime friend said she is deaf, blind and in poor health, spending much of her time in a wheelchair. She was last seen publicly in November at the funeral of her older sister, Alice Lee, who long represented the author and was known for being protective of her.  

Mystery: The sudden announcement of a new book from Harper Lee (left in 2007 and right circa 1960) has fans thrilled but confused. The reclusive writer fiercely avoided the spotlight for 55 years but now, aged 88 and in poor health, has signed off on publishing the book from which Mockingbird originally spun off

Some 'Mockingbird' fans encountered in Monroeville on Tuesday said they are excited by the news of a new book. 

'I bet it's going to be great. The first one was,' said Judy Turberville, of nearby Frisco City. Turberville said she can't wait to read 'Go Set a Watchman,' which publisher Harper said will be released July 14.

Ginger Brookover, who lives in West Virginia, is among the tourists who have been lured to Monroeville by 'Mockingbird.' In the middle of her second trip to town when the publisher announced Lee's new novel, Brookover got goose bumps.

'I'm just absolutely shaking,' she said.

Worldwide sales of 'To Kill A Mockingbird' have topped 40 million copies since its release in July 1960. Although occasionally banned over the years because of its language and racial themes, 'To Kill a Mockingbird' has become a standard for reading clubs and middle and high schools.

The movie version of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is the rare adaptation as beloved as its source material.

So when Harper Lee and her publisher announced Tuesday that this summer they'll release the 88-year-old author's second book, 'Go Set the Watchmen,' a kind of sequel to 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' the shockwaves were felt almost as much in Hollywood as they were in the book world.

The movies, after all, love a sequel. And rare is the chance to follow up one of the most iconic American films, half a century later.

If Lee agrees to sell the movie rights of her new book, it can be expected to be one of the most eagerly sought novels for optioning to the big screen. Particularly since Lee said Tuesday that 'Go Set the Watchman' follows her young heroine, Scout, into adulthood, it's sure to be feverishly pursued by producers. It's likely to spark a bidding war well before it lands on book shelves July 14.

Such an opportunity could draw in a host of high-profile producers. Oprah Winfrey, for one, has called 'To Kill a Mockingbird' her favorite book. (In a statement Tuesday, she said: 'I couldn't be happier if my name was Scout.')

Starring Gregory Peck and featuring a young Robert Duvall as Boo Radley, 'To Kill a Mockingbird' has regularly been ranked among the greatest American movies. It won three Oscars, including best actor for Peck and best-adapted screenplay for Horton Foote. In 1995, it was added to the National Film Registry, and in 2003 the American Film Institute listed Peck's Atticus Finch as the greatest movie hero of the 20th century.

'Congratulations to Harper Lee,' Duvall staid in a statement Tuesday. 'I am looking forward to reading the book. The film was a pivotal point in my career and we all have been waiting for the second book.'

Mary Badham, who was Oscar nominated at age 10 for her performance as Scout, only acted in a handful of films and TV shows after 'To Kill a Mockingbird.' Almost 40 years after her last film, she came out of retirement to appear in the 2005 indie drama 'Our Very Own.' Badham didn't respond to requests for comment Tuesday.
