Manchester United are keeping a watching brief on Stoke City goalkeeper Asmir Begovic.

United goalkeeping coach Chris Woods was in the stands for Stoke's win over Arsenal 10 days ago where 26-year-old Begovic kept a clean sheet.

The Bosnia No 1 was the subject of strong interest from Sir Alex Ferguson a year ago but the upturn in David de Gea's form meant a £12million bid was put on ice.

No interest: Contrary to reports, United are not considering a swoop for Arsenal's Thomas Vermaelen

Manchester City and Liverpool also showed interest in Begovic but the player has made it clear he will only leave if he has a chance of playing regular first-team football.

United are not unhappy with De Gea but want better quality and improved competition in every position for next season. De Gea is not being pushed enough by Anders Lindegaard and United will weigh up options ahead of the summer.

Stoke would want around £15m if they sold but have England keeper Jack Butland to call on should Begovic go.

Push: United want a serious challenge to David de Gea's position as No 1

De Gea and Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois have been linked with Real Madrid in Spanish media reports over recent days as Carlo Ancelotti considers bringing in a younger keeper for either Diego Lopez or Iker Casillas.

Meanwhile, Manchester United, who are signing FC Zurich midfield prospect Dimitri Mfomo, 16, will hand trials to two footballers from India. The 16-year-olds Arko Dey and Rajeeb Roy were spotted by local scouts as part of United's soccer schools in Calcutta.

United are also keen to bring 
in at least one new centre back this summer to replace Nemanja Vidic. 
They would prefer experience, hence scouts looking at Mehdi Benatia at 
Roma and Alex of PSG but David Moyes does not intend to pursue interest 
in Arsenal's Thomas Vermaelen. 

Real
 Madrid defender Sergio Ramos was someone they considered earlier in the
 season but they are not alone. The 27-year-old, has been linked with 
Manchester City also and is close friends with City winger Jesus Navas.

Ramos's brother Rene confirmed to Marca at the weekend that English clubs had been in contact.

'Out
 of respect for the club, I will simply say it is an English club,' said
 Rene. 'There are some very interesting offers, but Ramos is at a club 
where he wants to be. The world's best, in his eyes. And so we must say ''thank you very much for your interest, but no''.'

Arsenal are showing interest in Southampton full back Calum Chambers.

The 19-year-old is another product of Southampton's academy and signed a four year contract last summer. While most eyes have been fixed on the progress of Luke Shaw and Adam Lallana, Chambers has steadily developed into one of the Premier League's outstanding prospects and has established himself in the England U19 squad.

He has been at Southampton since the age of eight alongside the likes of James Ward-Prowse, Harrison Reed and Sam Gallagher and is holding down the right-back berth ahead of competition from Nathaniel Clyne.

Arsenal are weighing up replacements for Bacary Sagna as contract talks rumble on and Chambers is ticking most of the boxes.

Red Bull Salzburg defender Martin Hinteregger is attracting more Premier League scouts by the week.

Manchester United have been watching the 21-year-old since last summer, Arsenal and Newcastle have also been at Salzburg games while Liverpool saw him in action for Austria against Uruguay last week.

There are reservations about whether the 6ft 3in defender, who can also play left back, is quite ready for the Premier League but, in watching him, eyes have also been drawn to his team-mates at Salzburg.

No nonsense: Hinteregger has been attracting interest from Man Utd, Arsenal, Liverpool and Newcastle

They outclassed Ajax in their recent Europa League tie winning 6-1 on aggregate and the reputations of young midfielders Kevin Kampl, 23, and Valon Berisha, 21, plus forwards Alan, 24, and Sadio Mane, 21, are fast developing.

Newcastle are particularly keen on Senegalese winger Mane with Graham Carr watching in recent weeks and several clubs have watched Brazilian Alan on his way to 21 goals this season. However, he would struggle to gain a work permit.

Cardiff City scout Tommy Johnson watched Halifax striker Lee Gregory at the weekend. The 25-year-old didn't disappoint as he scored a hat-trick in Halifax's 5-1 win at Hyde.

Cardiff are weighing up all options for the summer and, with relegation still a possibility, wanted to check whether Gregory could step up a few levels.

Cardiff missed out to Leicester in the bidding for Jamie Vardy from Fleetwood 18 months ago and Gregory has been likened to the 27-year-old Vardy in terms of style and goalscoring record.

Blackburn and Barnsley were also represented on Saturday to see Gregory take his season's tally to 24 goals in 28 games.

Gregory wants to break the 30-goal barrier before the end of the season and has been ruing a broken hand which ruled him out for 11 games earlier in the season.

Cardiff are also showing interest in Leicester City's Andy King. The 25-year-old Wales midfielder has been in and out of the starting line-up this season but is eager to play his part in their promotion push before taking stock of his future in the summer.

Fulham are continuing to watch Swedish teenage striker Tidjani Diawara. Scouts were present as the 15-year-old, who made his first team debut LAST season, played for Rynninge IK in their 5-0 Swedish Cup defeat against IF Elfsborg.

Asked about Diawara's performance, Rynninge coach Peder Hessel told Nerikes Allehanda: 'He was completely cooked. It was a pity that he could not show a bit more, we heard that Fulham were here and looked at him.

'I hope they follow him for a long time, because today I think he was a bit taken aback by the gravity of the moment.

'There has been much written and talked about him recently, and it's not so easy to handle.'

Admiring glances: Juventus are keen to bring Manchester City left-back Aleksander Kolarov in the summer

Elsewhere, Juventus remain keen on Manchester City defender Aleksandar Kolarov, 28, and Charlton goalkeeper Ben Hamer, 26, is out of contract at the end of the season and has yet to be agree a new deal.
