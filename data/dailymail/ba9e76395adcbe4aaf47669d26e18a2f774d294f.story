Flight steward Sanjid Singh, 41, made a last minute shift swap and boarded flight MH17

It’s an astonishing twist of fate – a Malaysian air steward is dead after swapping himself onto flight MH17, only months after his wife, who is also a steward, saved her own life by swapping herself off the missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370.

Sanjid Singh's last minute decision to board Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 has devastated his family.

The Malaysian Insider reported that the 41-year-old had swapped flights with a colleague to fly on the Kuala Lumpur-bound Boeing 777.

His wife had swapped out of flight MH370 which has been missing since March.

The father of the steward, 71-year-old Jijar Singh, sobbed as he said was eager to see his youngest child and only son after the flight.

'He always called us before he leaves for his trip,' Sanjid's father said.

'Sanjid's wife was meant to fly on MH370 but swapped with another colleague at the last minute.'
