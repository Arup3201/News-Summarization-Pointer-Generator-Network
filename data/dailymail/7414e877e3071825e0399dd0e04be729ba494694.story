When Tom Cleverley and Fabio Borini were children, they cherished dreams of growing up to enjoy a career in professional football. 

And they loved these things:

No go: Tom Cleverley and Fabio Borini failed to complete moves on deadline day because they could not agree personal terms with their prospective new clubs 

So if you could go and have a chat with 11-year-old Tom or Fabio, and suggest to them both that one-day they might turn down a move because they wouldn’t be paid £60,000-a-week (in Cleverley’s case) or £90,000-a-week (in Borini’s case) and they would think you were an idiot.

They are players who, possibly under instruction from ‘advisers’ have chosen to put money before football.

They are players who care more about the wages than actually playing the game.

Learn from the master: Cleverley could have benefited from playing under Roy Keane at Villa

They are players who have chosen to pick up money training all week, without the special feeling of playing in front of thousands of fans who have handed over heard-earned cash to watch them play.

They are players who make you lose the faith in the beautiful game in this modern era.

Borini’s conduct has been bizarre at best. He was loved by Sunderland fans – guaranteed hero status after scoring a late winner in the North East derby at the Stadium of Light and getting the first when the Mackems hammered the Toon 3-0 at St James’ Park a few months later.

The club, the manager and the fans all wanted him to sign for Sunderland. It was all agreed, it was a no-brainer. Except someone with no brains decided it would be a good idea to get greedy and see if more money could be had at QPR.

Cult status: Borini became a hero at Sunderland during his loan spell at the club last season

Thankfully for Rangers, chairman Tony Fernandes has wised up to players and advisers taking his pants down so Borini was sent packing.

Niko Kranjcar, meanwhile, took a 66 per cent pay cut to re-join Harry Redknapp at Loftus Road.

Aston Villa wanted Cleverley. No hang on, Manchester United legend Roy Keane, the kind of player - on his day - that Cleverley only wishes he could be, wanted him at Villa Park.

Yet those talks ended up with Villa ‘unhappy’, Cleverley out of the door, and the deal off. Minutes later Everton said no, and Cleverley is left at Manchester United under a manager who was quite happy to let him go.

All smiles: Niko Kranjcar was more than happy to take a large paycut to re-join Harry Redknapp at QPR

I’m told Cleverley wants to play football. I’m left asking, ‘How much?’

Cleverley should be paying Keane for the education he would have received under him at Villa.

To learn from Keane should have been his priority, regardless of wages, and regardless of Everton stepping in late on.

I still believe in the soul of football, I still believe most players love the game and playing more than they love money.

But I also know there will be one or two players who let themselves down and forget that time of innocence when they were young boys who felt the joy and excitement of kicking a football.

Those guys are much poorer for losing that special feeling this beautiful game can bring.
