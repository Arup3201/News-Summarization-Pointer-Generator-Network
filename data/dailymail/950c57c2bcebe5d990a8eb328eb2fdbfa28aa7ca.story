Cuts: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is in talks with NHS bosses about how to fill a £2bn gap

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is in talks with NHS bosses about how to fill a £2billion gap in its funding.

Senior sources say the ageing population, the cost of new drugs and the rising pensions bill for staff has left the health service in England with the shortfall for next year.

Chris Ham, head of the King’s Fund think tank, said there was a ‘real risk’ some hospitals could run out of money unless they received a significant cash injection.

‘Everywhere you look across the NHS there are pressures facing patient care,’ he told the BBC, which obtained the £2billion figure. 

‘They’re having to find even bigger efficiency savings to balance the books and deliver good standards of patient care. That’s a very, very big ask.’

The NHS budget for England for 2015 is around £100billion.

David Cameron has not ring-fenced spending on the health service and its budget has risen only by the rate of inflation – without taking into account the rising population and other cost pressures.

Mr Cameron played down concerns at Prime Minister’s Questions yesterday, saying efficiency targets for the NHS had been met every year, and the cash ploughed back into frontline care.

Anita Charlesworth of the Health Foundation think tank said the health service had been doing well at making savings.

But she added: ‘There is a “pincer” – as the NHS takes on more nurses, drug prices are rising and their pension costs are rising, as part of government policy.

'We’re not going to find this money behind the sofa, so it would mean the Treasury stepping in. If it can’t do that, we’re faced with cutting services and cutting quality.’ 

The Department of Health said: ‘The NHS is on track to make £20billion savings this parliament and we are confident it will continue to make the savings necessary to meet rising demand.’

Meanwhile, some Liberal Democrat ministers are understood to be pushing for an increase in the NHS budget.

Proposals: GPs rejected a move to charge patients for appointments to improve attendance (file photo)

Leader Nick Clegg is being lobbied by those who think the party should call for more borrowing or spending cuts elsewhere to fund vital health services.

A source said: ‘We could differentiate ourselves from the Conservatives on something the public really care about for a change.’

GPs and nurses’ leaders have suggested charging patients for appointments, in part to save money.  Earlier this year, GPs held a vote on charging for appointments at the British Medical Association’s local medical committee conference in York.

The idea was to deter patients from missing consultations – a problem that costs £160million a year. The fees – possibly between £10 and £25 – would be the first since the NHS was founded in 1948.

Although the GPs rejected the idea, it has not gone away.

Yesterday the Royal College of Nursing’s annual conference in Liverpool debated whether patients should be charged up to £10 for seeing their GP.

Nurses who put forward the motion said that NHS finances were ‘not infinite’.

Once again, the motion was defeated. But its very presence on the conference agenda show it is an increasingly live issue.
