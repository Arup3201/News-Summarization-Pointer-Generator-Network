Ryanair was today fined £8.3million by a French court for breaching employment laws related to the 
treatment of local workers hired on foreign contracts.

The low-cost airline, which was said to have breached a range of regulations between 2007 and 2010, intends to appeal the decision. 

Prosecutors told judges in Aix-en-Provence that Ryanair regularly employed local staff from Marseille on Irish contracts.

This meant that instead of paying up to 45 per cent in contributions – the normal figure in France – they paid just 10.75 per cent in Irish charges.

The court judgement read that this was viewed as ‘clear social dumping’ and that the case was ‘an issue of unfair competition against other airlines that respect national legislation’.

Ryanair’s actual fine was 200,000 euros (£167,000) but it was also ordered to pay more than £7.5million in backdated contributions for using Irish-registered workers at its Marseille 
transport hub between 2007 and 2010.

Rival airline Easyjet has already been given fines of more than £1million for the same offence.

Lawyers for Ryanair insisted that their crews in Marseille worked for an airline with a registered office in Ireland, and pointed out that they spent their working day on Irish-registered planes.

'Ryanair crews were correctly working under Irish labour contracts and paid Irish social insurance in accordance with the applicable European employment and social security laws,' the company said in a statement.

Ryanair had four planes and 127 employees at Marignane airport, near Marseille, without applying French employment laws or filling out tax declarations in the country.

Prosecutors had even urged the Aix-en-Provence court to symbolically confiscate four Boeing 737s based at the site - a request which was refused.

The civil plaintiffs in the case, which include a pilots' union and a pensions fund, were seeking more than £8million in damages.

Roland Rappaport, a lawyer for the SNPL pilots' union, had urged the court to 'make an example' of Ryanair in its ruling.

Prosecutors said there was no doubt Ryanair was operating in France, given that it had material and staff based permanently at the airport, and its employees lived in the area.

'We are dealing with a company whose only goal is to counter the law in defiance of the interests of workers,' said prosecution papers.

Ryanair confirmed it had expected a 'negative ruling and a fine', adding in statement: 'Ryanair confirms that it will appeal any such negative ruling and any attempt by the French authorities to seek payment of social insurance payments which have already been paid in full in Ireland.'

Ryanair has suffered negative publicity in 
France over the Marseille dispute even as it remained the country's 3rd 
largest airline, with more than 3million passengers in 2010.

The
court's ruling also mentioned the airline's practice of drawing public 
subsidies in regions surrounding its air transport hubs, typically 
secondary airports far from major urban centres which allow it to save 
money on airport taxes.

'This will
serve as a reminder to all those who pay big subsidies to Ryanair that 
they can no longer support illegal activity,' said Claire Hocquet, a 
lawyer for SNPL. Public bodies that continue to 
subsidise Ryan could be 'called to order,' she added.

The
ruling, not the first airline punished for labour 
violations in France, highlights tension between protective local 
employment law and EU rules on labour mobility.

The
European Union's 2006 'services directive' grants firms considerable 
leeway to post employees to work in other member states, though many 
professional sectors are excluded.

Ryanair has since shut its permanent Marseille hub and operated only a summer operation since April 2011.
