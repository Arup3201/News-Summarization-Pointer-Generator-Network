Many young adults have a horrible feeling that, come middle age, they will develop the sartorial habits and odd tics of their parents.

And they are right – except it happens even earlier than they expect.

In fact, most find themselves turning into their own mother or father at the tender age of 32. And the reason? They have children of their own.

Kim Kardashian, 32, should be morphing into her mother Kris Jenner, right, any day now

A survey by website Netmums listed 50 
‘giveaway behaviours’ that show you are turning into your own parent, 
from preferring estate cars over hatchbacks to realising the bins go out
 more often than you do.

Mothers
 admitted ‘fancying children’s TV presenters over rock stars’ and 
thinking 6am is a ‘time for getting up, not getting in’.

They also cited not knowing a single song in the charts and having handbags crammed with baby wipes and toys.

Fathers
 said they stop buying casual clothes, leave Facebook because they are 
jealous of childless friends’ excitement-filled posts and find that air 
travel is no longer any fun at all.

Young adults: Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge both turn 32 next year

Other giveaways included finding day-old cups of tea and worrying about a daughter’s future boyfriends.

More than nine in ten of the 1,092 parents surveyed said their children had changed everything for them.

Two-thirds
 suffered from lack of sleep, six in ten complained of the cost and 
more  than eight in ten said they no longer had any free time.

But
 many reported a positive effect, with a third describing themselves as 
‘more tolerant’ and a similar proportion saying they cared more about 
their community.

Netmums 
founder Siobhan Freegard said: ‘Parenting is the great leveller. 
Whatever your class or job or education, or wherever you live, if you’re
 a mum or dad you’ll do certain things which mark you out as a parent.’

The results echo Prince William’s comments that the arrival of his son George had changed his life.

He
 and Kate both turn 32 next year. Perhaps they already feel as though 
they are turning into Prince Charles and Carole Middleton.
