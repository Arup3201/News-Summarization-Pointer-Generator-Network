Cardiff defender Juan Cala has left the Sky Bet Championship club following an apology to club owner Vincent Tan.

Cala's departure comes just a week after he criticised Cardiff for being sent to train at the club's academy, although Bluebirds manager Russell Slade said ahead of last weekend's 1-0 league win at Watford that the centre-back 'is doing his rehab work there'.

'Cardiff City Football Club can confirm that on Wednesday, 3rd December 2014, Juan Cala's contract with the club was terminated by mutual agreement,' said a club statement.

The former Sevilla man was signed by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but has struggled to make the team this season

'The player leaves Cardiff City with immediate effect.

'We would like to thank Juan for his contribution and wish him the very best for his future.'

Cala had earlier apologised to Tan on Twitter for his academy comments last week.

'I wish to apologise to Tan Sri Vincent Tan for my recent comments. He had nothing to do with my move to the academy,' Cala wrote on Twitter.

The 25-year-old Spanish centre-back, who was signed by former Cardiff manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer from Sevilla in January, has made only one Championship appearance this season having slipped down the pecking order below Bruno Ecuele Manga, Ben Turner, Sean Morrison and Danny Gabbidon.

Slade had said on Friday that Cardiff would investigate whether Cala had broken club discipline rules on social media and would look to move the player on during the January transfer window.

Cala made 11 appearances for Cardiff and scored two goals, both coming in the Barclays Premier League last season at Everton and Southampton.
