An actress returned from her first evening out following the birth of her son to find him dying in his father’s arms after they fell asleep together on the sofa.

Leigh Arnold, a well-known television star in her native Ireland, was urged by fiance Steve Davies to take a break from looking after their two-and-a-half-week-old son Flynn and have dinner with a friend.

But on her return she found Flynn ‘grey’ and lifeless as his father slept.

Despite the frantic efforts of Mr Davies and paramedics to revive him, Flynn was pronounced dead in hospital an hour later.

Now an inquest has ruled that Flynn had succumbed to Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, or cot death.

Doctors who gave evidence at the hearing told the distraught couple there was nothing more they could have done.

The actress, who is best-known for playing Dr Clodagh Delaney in Irish medical drama The Clinic, told the inquest she collapsed when she realised her son’s life was in danger.

Miss Arnold, 34, said: ‘Flynn was lying facing up. I could see his whole body. He wasn’t squashed. I saw by his face there was definitely something wrong.

‘I just know that I screamed an awful lot and my legs went from under me. I don’t remember an awful lot else.’ 

She added: ‘He was a perfect baby. He was healthy and extremely loved and adored and is missed every second of the day.’

Miss Arnold told the hearing Flynn had shown no signs of being ill in the days preceding the tragedy, and said she had left him feeding happily from his bottle on the night he died.

She said: ‘I was invited out to dinner and didn’t feel it was the right thing to do, but knowing [the restaurant] was only down the road Steven said, “Go and have a break”, and I knew he would be OK.’

Mr Davies, a company director, told the hearing in Macclesfield he and Flynn had visited the supermarket after dropping off his fiancee at the restaurant.

He returned home to the village of Ashley in Cheshire at 8pm, where the family’s au pair was taking care of Flynn’s one-year-old brother Hunter.

Mr Davies said: ‘I put the TV on and took Flynn out of his cradle. He kept waking up, then going back to sleep. I warmed a bottle up for him and he woke up again and had that.

‘Leigh called me to see if he was all right. I said he was OK and feeding at the time.

‘I was feeding him and he was in my arms. I was laid down on the chaise longue and he was in the crook of my left arm. That was the last thing I remember.’

Mr Davies fell asleep at around 11pm, only to be woken by Miss Arnold’s screams when she returned from her meal at 1.30am.

A police investigation undertaken after Flynn’s death determined nobody was at fault and nothing could have been done to save him.

Earlier this year Miss Arnold said she was taking 'one day at a time' following the tragedy

Paediatrician Dr Cate Lenton told the hearing Flynn was a ‘perfect baby’, and explained that cot death doesn’t always occur in cots. ‘While they are asleep they just turn off,’ she said. ‘It is just a baby that stops while it is asleep.’ 

Home Office pathologist Dr Gauri Batra gave a cause of death as ‘unascertained’, but added there was nothing at all to indicate an unnatural cause of death. Reaching a conclusion of death by natural causes, coroner Janet Napier told the tearful couple: ‘This was a sudden, tragic switching off in the sleep. I can’t properly say how awful this is. I give you my sincere sympathy.’

Miss Arnold and Mr Davies were due to wed last year but postponed the ceremony after Flynn’s death in May. They are now due to marry in Ibiza next month with Hunter, now two years old, acting as ring-bearer.

Earlier this year Miss Arnold told an Irish newspaper she was taking ‘one day at a time’ following the tragedy, and had only just started to think about looking for acting roles.

She added: ‘It’s been the most awful year of my life, obviously, and I would very much like to have the confidence to go out and start looking again.’

NHS advice on preventing cot death includes placing a baby to sleep on their back in a cot, and avoiding falling asleep with them on a sofa or armchair.
