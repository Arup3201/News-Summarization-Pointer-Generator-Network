An Australian sign language interpreter has become an internet sensation after his performance at a press conference over the cyclone which has cause £1billion in damage across eastern Australia.

Mark Cave was standing beside Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk at a press conference, when reaction to his efforts started to trend on Twitter. 

People were impressed by Mr Cave's expressive facial features and dramatic hand gestures as he warned deaf people about the approaching storm.

Twitter users soon began praising Mr Cave's over-the-top facial expressions and arm gestures 

Many people got distracted by the energetic performance and Mr Cave's range of expressions 

Mr Cave was using Auslan, an Australian version of sign language, to deliver his message. 

Premier Palaszczuk was giving advice about the impending Category Five Cyclone which was about to hit Queensland. 

Due to the danger posed by the storm Mr Cave's gestures were exaggerated to highlight the severity of the situation.  

Charlie Swinbourne, editor of Limping Chicken, a blog for the deaf community said someone using sign language will change their mannerisms to emphasise certain words in the same way hearing people can do it with the inflection of their voice. 

Mr Cave used the exaggerated signs to highlight the danger posed by Tropical Cyclone Marcia 

Mr Cave said he would rather not be in the spotlight claiming that he was 'just hoping to fly under the radar'

He blogged: 'Well, if you’re signing about a storm, and telling people that they really need to take the advice you’re giving them, otherwise they might be injured or die, it’s not enough just to tell them – you need to show them, visually, through your demeanour, just how serious this situation is, and how powerful the storm might be.

'And that’s exactly what these interpreters are doing. Watching the video video of Mark Cave in action, he’s no more animated than he should be, and the information he gives is perfectly clear. In some ways, the way these interpreters go viral every time a storm comes is a good thing, in terms of raising public awareness of Deaf people – who are often so hidden from wider view – and of the language we use. 

'What worries me is that some people think that the interpreters are doing something comical – which they aren’t.

'These skilled interpreters aren’t making fun of the situation, or giving people at home a cheap laugh. They’re simply signing in the most expressive and powerful way they can in order to tell deaf people how they can remain safe.'

People on Twitter supportive of Mr Cave's efforts managed to get the hastag #signguy trending 

Some users used Mr Cave's new-found popularity to have fun with Photoshop by manipulating his image

However some deaf campaigners criticised some of the Photoshop efforts as they diminished his message

Mr Cave said he was slightly surprised by his new-found fame: 'I’m sort of a private person. I’d rather not be in the spotlight, but I know this is such an important thing to do, and I feel confident I can do a good job.

'I’m just hoping to fly under the radar and nobody will look at me afterwards.'

Following Friday's storms, some 700 troops have been placed on standby to help with cleanup efforts. 

Premier Palaszczuk said: 'At this stage, everyone is breathing a deep sigh of relief that there has been no loss of life.'

However, most properties in the northern Queensland towns of Rockhampton and Yeppoon had been left without power, she added.

The worst of the rain would pass by Sunday as the storm is moving quickly back out to sea, the weather bureau said.

In Rockhampton, long queues snaked out of the only fuel station left with the power to run its petrol pumps, as people flocked to refill cars and get fuel to operate generators.

Residents ducked fallen trees and power lines to gather at the few automatic cash machines still functioning.

Heavy machinery was pressed into assist efforts to clear debris on the road to Yeppoon, the coastal town hit hardest by Marcia, but fallen power lines left many roads impassable. 

In northern Australia, teams were heading to two communities on the remote islands of Goulburn and Elcho to weigh up damage after Cyclone Lam, packing wind speeds ranging up to 160mph, began to lash the Northern Territory late on Thursday.
