The Red Arrows famous diamond nine formation have been given the all clear to fly again after the deaths of two of their pilots.

The display team had been grounded following the deaths of Flight Lieutenant Sean 
Cunnigham due the failure of his ejector seat in November 2011 and that 
of Flight Lieutenant of Jon Egging at the Bournemouth Air Show in August
2011.

However, they've now been given the nod to fly again after being handed a  Public Display Authority (PDA) by The Chief of the Air Staff, Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Dalton.

The Red Arrows finally had all of the members of the diamond formation back as they trained in Cyprus

The PDA, which it must get each year, 
confirms that the display proposed for the year is safe and meets the 
standards expected of a team that represents the Royal Air Force and the
UK.

The team were spotted honing their skills on a training mission in Cyprus - training at RAF Akrotiri, in the Mediterranean, in preparation for a summer of displays.

Sir Stephen said: 'The Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team, the Red Arrows, have designed a display of precision formation flying that encapsulates the agility and demonstrates the pure flying qualities required in the Royal Air Force.

'The Reds are an iconic symbol of the United Kingdom and their displays are vividly demonstrating excellence in precision, teamwork and dynamic flying.'

The PDA is effectively a sign-off 
that the display programme the Red Arrows are planning - practised 
meticulously during the 'closed season' - is safe, an RAF spokesman 
said.

With changes to the nine-aircraft team, and new manoeuvres added to the routine, the display has to be checked each year.

Earlier this year the team flew in 
its world famous diamond formation of nine planes, over Lincolnshire, 
for the first time in 18 months, then continued practice from RAF 
Akrotiri in Cyprus for extra winter training, benefiting from the better
weather conditions.

Flight Lieutenant Sean James 
Cunningham, 35, was killed when he was ejected from his Hawk T1 while on
the ground at the Red Arrows base at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire.

An
inquest heard that that Flt Lt Cunningham had completed ground safety 
checks when the ejector seat of his Hawk jet was deployed.

The main parachute did not deploy and
the pilot did not become separated from his seat during the incident, 
the hearing was told.

The Arrows had been suspended following the death of two of their pilots in 2011

He landed on the ground still strapped into his seat.

Lieutenant
of Jon Egging died when his single-engine jet went out of control as 
they returned to Bournemouth Air Show on Saturday afternoon.

Pictures showed how the plane smashed into the ground and then skidded along, gouging a deep crater in the field before finally coming to a standstill.

Eyewitnesses reported seeing the 
pilot steer away from houses to crash land, with the plane 'bouncing' 
across a farmer's field before grinding to a halt.

The two men had joined the Red Arrows at the same time the previous year.

The Red Arrows were formed in 1964 as an all-RAF display team.

Since 1966 there have been nine volunteer pilots each year, with ten applicants for each place on the team.

They must have completed 1,500 flying hours, completed at least one tour on a fast jet, or have been judged as above average as a pilot.

Red Arrow pilots can experience forces up top five times the force of gravity and when performing some manoeuvres can reach seven times.

In July 2004 there was speculation  that the Red Arrows would be disbanded, after a defence spending review, due to running costs of up to £6million but their role in helping develop business in the defence industry stopped this.
