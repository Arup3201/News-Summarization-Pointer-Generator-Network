Former Australia paceman Brett Lee has agreed a short-term deal to act as Ireland's bowling coach in the build-up to the World Cup.

The 38-year-old, who retired from all forms of cricket last month after taking almost 700 wickets in Test and ODI cricket for Australia, will assist Ireland during their warm-up period in Sydney.

Ireland head coach Phil Simmons said of the World Cup winner: 'Brett Lee has a wonderful knowledge of fast bowling, and his special insight of Australian pitches will help give our bowlers further confidence ahead of their group matches.

'I'm sure all our bowlers will benefit from the experience that a two-time World Cup winner has accumulated, especially in the pressure situations of a global event.

'It's a fantastic opportunity for our bowlers to learn from a living legend and one I'm sure they'll all benefit from.'

Lee took three wickets in the final but his side were beaten by the Perth Scorchers in Canberra

Ireland play Randwick Petersham in a 50-over friendly on Friday before official warm-up games against Scotland next Tuesday and Bangladesh two days later.

Ireland have been drawn in Pool B of the World Cup alongside India, Pakistan, South Africa, Zimbabwe, UAE and the West Indies, who they face in their opening game in Nelson on February 16.
