West Brom's £10million record signing Brown Ideye has hit back at his critics after admitting some are calling him 's***'.

The Nigeria striker moved to the Hawthorns from Dynamo Kiev in the summer but has bagged just one goal - in the Capital One Cup - so far for his new club.

Alan Irvine has even omitted Ideye from his West Brom squad for the last two Barclays Premier League matches and the 26-year-old admits he is getting a hard time.

'A lot of people are writing on my Instagram and Twitter page saying "you’re s***" or "you’re not worth the money",' said Ideye.

'You can’t criticise me, I’ve not been playing. How can you criticise somebody who has not been playing?

'I have found it difficult but people can’t criticise, pull me down or have a gun at my head for not playing. I don’t think that is fair.

'It makes me stronger and makes me want to bounce back as quickly as possible.'

Ideye also insisted he will soon prove his class and blamed bad luck with injuries for his barren run in front of goal. 

The Baggies front man also hinted at turning round his form by scoring in a 2-0 friendly win against Leicester held behind closed doors on Wednesday.

'I just want to show the world and everybody what I can do,' he added.

'I have been doing it since the first club I played (for) in Europe and I have never been a flop.

'I am just unlucky, it was unfortunate I got injured and when I was out the team was doing very well.'
