A woman had been charged with the murder of her own daughter after hitting her so hard the girl's stomach burst.

11-year-old Raasania J. Coley died as a result of blunt force trauma shortly after 9pm Friday, after officers found the girl unresponsive at home in Waukegan, Illinois.

Nicholette R. Lawrence, 32, was charged with first degree murder after telling investigators she had struck the child earlier in the week.

The young girl was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead. 

Lake County Coroner's office said that an autopsy determined the cause of  death to be a torn stomach as a result of blunt force trauma, Fox 32 News reports.

According to police, Lawrence has two other children, who also lived in the home, but there have been no allegations of abuse towards them. These children have been placed with relatives.

Lawrence was charged with first-degree murder and is held at the Lake County Jail on $5 million bond. She is next due to appear in court on September 30.

According to ABC News, neighbors said Raasania rarely came outside the home. 

'We've been staying here for three years, we were here half of a year before I knew they had an oldest daughter,' next door neighbor Simone Allen told the news channel.

Ms Allen said the few times she did see Raasania, she had a feeling something was wrong with the child.

'Every time I looked at her I just saw the hurt and pain, it was like something she wanted to say but couldn't say it,' she added.
