Former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw suggested last night that he may have been sacked by Tony Blair following pressure from George Bush’s White House.

Mr Straw, who was Foreign Secretary during the Iraq war in 2003, was demoted three years later to Leader of the Commons.

Yesterday, he said hawkish allies of Mr Bush may have had a hand in his removal after he ruled out Britain ever joining an attack against Iran.

Sacked: Jack Straw, who was Foreign Secretary during the Iraq war in 2003, was demoted three years later to Leader of the Commons after, he believes, the intervention of senior figures in the Bush administration

He said neo-conservatives in the White House such as UN ambassador John Bolton were ‘never terribly keen on me’.

But he conceded that his public insistence in 2004 that war against Iran was ‘inconceivable’ also led to a rift with Mr Blair.

Asked by Total Politics magazine whether he believed the Bush administration played a hand in his sacking, he replied: ‘People say that. The neo-cons, people like John Bolton, were never terribly keen on me, but I’ve no idea what observations were made through the back door.

‘Tony and I were getting to a different place on handling Iran, and Tony certainly felt disconcerted when I said that it was inconceivable that the UK would go to war with Iran and described a nuclear attack as nuts.

‘As events have proved, we haven’t been involved in military action in Iran – it’s inconceivable now – there’s no way a British House of Commons would approve any kind of military action in Iran.

'And a nuclear strike remains nuts.’

Mr Straw suggested he could have extended Mr Blair’s tenure at No10 if he had remained at the Foreign Office, but Mr Blair’s decision to exile him to the Commons in 2005 made it impossible for him to save the Prime Minister from himself.

But he suggests he could have 'saved Blair' if he stayed on the front bench
