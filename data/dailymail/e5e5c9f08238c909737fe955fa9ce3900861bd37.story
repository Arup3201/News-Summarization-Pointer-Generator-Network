Gary Lineker has insisted the BBC would have screened Bradford's FA Cup fifth-round clash had their opponents been known prior to the fourth-round replays.

And the League One side didn't let him forget it by posting a cheeky tweet aimed at Lineker and Mark Chapham following their giant killing against Sunderland. 

The corporation has come in for criticism after overlooking the League One club despite their stunning upset of Chelsea in the last 32.

Match of the Day 2 presenter Mark Chapman was also targeted by Bradford's cheeky tweet

Of the eight ties played across three days, Bradford's was one of only three not shown live by either the BBC or BT Sport.

And the Bantams did their bit to make the broadcasters regret their decision by upsetting Sunderland 2-0 at Valley Parade to reach the quarter-finals for the first time since 1976.

Sunderland needed a replay to get past Fulham in round four and Lineker claimed that was a key factor in the BBC selecting Aston Villa's clash with Leicester and Manchester United's trip to Preston ahead of the Bradford match.

The presenter tweeted: 'The BBC can only show 2 ties in each round and select them pre replays. If they could've waited Bradford would obviously have been chosen.'

Bradford fans made their feelings known during the match, causing embarrassment for one veteran BBC presenter.

Look North stalwart Harry Gration tweeted: 'I am in trouble. Filmed singing are you watching BBC. Sorry'.

Lineker led the BBC's coverage from Villa Park as the home side held on for a 2-1 victory in a match that only came to life in the final stages.

The poor fare on offer prompted Match of the Day presenter Mark Chapman to write on Twitter: 'We're debating whether this goes last on tonight's £Motd or whether we leave it off altogether.'
