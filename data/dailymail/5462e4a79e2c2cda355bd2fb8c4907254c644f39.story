Police have ended their search for the body of missing five-year-old April Jones, it was announced today.

In the UK's biggest ever operation of its kind, search teams have covered thousands of acres of rugged land and deep river water in a desperate attempt to find April since she went missing on October 1 from outside her home in Machynlleth, mid Wales.

On Friday, however, searches of all key areas were completed and April's parents were given the heartbreaking news that they may never get to say goodbye to their daughter.

Long search: Specialist forces have battled through awful weather during this year's treacherous winter

April was snatched while she was playing on her bike with friends last year in the grounds of the estate where she lived with her parents, Coral and Paul.

Local lifeguard Mark Bridger, 47, was later arrested and charged with abducting and murdering the little girl, who suffered from cerebral palsy. Bridger, who is also accused of perverting the course of justice, is due to stand trial next week.

April's disappearance sparked what is believed to have been the largest police search in UK history.

Over the past seven months, specialist forces from across the UK have covered the 'extremely challenging' terrain of the Welsh countryside surrounding her home town, scouring mountains, gorges, streams and waterfalls.

'The search areas identified during the course of the investigation were completed on Friday, 19 April. In addition, a reactive team of specialist officers are available to respond to any new information that is received.'
