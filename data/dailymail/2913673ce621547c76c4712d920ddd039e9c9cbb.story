A wife who said she shot her retired police officer husband to death in self-defence was today acquitted of his murder.

But Barbara Sheehan, 50, was convicted by a New York jury of a weapons charge that will result in her serving some prison time.

Her supporters cheered as the verdict was read, with many dressed in purple to support domestic violence victims. But Sheehan will be jailed for between three and 15 years for the weapon charge.

Trial over: Barbara Sheehan, 50, of New York, pictured last month, was only convicted by a Queens jury of a weapons charge over the shooting of her husband Raymond Sheehan at their home

Sheehan says she shot her 49-year-old husband of 24 years, Raymond, 11 times after suffering decades of physical and verbal abuse.

He allegedly pointed a 9mm Glock at her and she shot him with a .38-calibre revolver.

She says he threatened to kill her and
he meant it. But prosecutors said she was not abused and was angry over
her husband's infidelities.

Authorities say she fired 11 times while her husband, a former New York City police sergeant, was shaving in the bathroom.

Court documents said Sheehan told 
police the night of the incident: ‘I shot him! I shot him! I think he's 
dead. He's in the bathroom.’

Together: Sheehan, right, claimed her husband Raymond, left, was an abusive, reckless and terrifying man

Legal experts said the case is a test of the battered-woman defence.

'I don't think people understand how bad it was at home. I don't think they understand how my 
father threatened to kill us and how if we told anybody about what he 
was doing that he'd kill us too'

This is when the history of abuse is 
explored to explain a woman's mental state at the time she is accused of
committing a crime.

The issue is self-defence, which under
New York state law justifies the use of lethal force in response to an 
immediate threat to life.

Under the battered-woman defence, lethal force can sometimes be justified even if the threat may not appear immediate.

Sheehan testified her husband smashed her head 
against a cinder-block wall when they were on holiday in 2007, reported the New York Times.

On the 
day of the killing in February 2008 he allegedly threw boiling pasta 
sauce at her and punched her in the face.

Allegations: Sheehan shot her husband 11 times using two handguns that he kept loaded, prosecutors say

‘She acted out of defence,’ her daughter Jennifer Joyce said. ‘There were no other options. He was pointing a gun to her head.’

Prosecutors said there were other reasons Sheehan killed her husband. She was allegedly furious over his infidelity and sexual habits such as wearing nappies and women's clothes.

They also said she would benefit from life insurance policies - but Sheehan's son Ray disputed this.

‘I don't think people understand how bad it was at home,’ he said.

‘I don't think they understand how my 
father threatened to kill us and how if we told anybody about what he 
was doing that he'd kill us too.
