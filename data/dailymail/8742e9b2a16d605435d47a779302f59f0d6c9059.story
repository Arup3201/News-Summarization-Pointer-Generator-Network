Joshua Varey, 24, from Colne, Lancashire, was jailed for 126 days after admitting animal cruelty at Burnley Magistrates' Court

Three thugs who laughed as they set their dogs on other terrified animals so they could make 'trophy' videos for a dog fighting racket were sent to prison today.

Joshua Varey, 24, filmed accomplices Shaun Mullens, 22, and Paul Ashworth, 49, all from Colne, Lancashire, climbing up a tree and trying to shake a cat out of its branches so that their dogs could maul it.

The younger two men also filmed a horrifying incident in which they used one of their dogs to attack a badger after digging into its sett.

Today all three were jailed after pleading guilty to animal cruelty charges at Burnley Magistrates' Court in Lancashire.

Magistrates had seen DVD footage in which Varey could be heard laughing as distressed animals yelped in terror.  In one attack, caught on film, a voice was heard saying 'It's dead' before a badly injured badger crawled away.

The court had heard that police and RSPCA officers found the DVD during dawn raids at 11 homes across Pendle last summer, in which officers seized three lurchers, two terriers and a lurcher/bull terrier cross, as well as computers, mobile phones, cash and drugs equipment

The operation followed a 12-month evidence gathering operation into badger digging, deer poaching, hare coursing and offences under the Dangerous Dogs Act.

Last October, six cats were killed by lurchers in attacks in Colne over three days. Police said the incidents were known as ‘cat coursing', where dogs were trained to kill domestic pets before going poaching or badger baiting.

JPs heard that Varey, who bought and sold dogs for profit, and bred them to fight other animals, had injured and scarred dogs in cages outside at his home and was proud that his animals were 'adept at fighting.'

Paul Taylor, prosecuting, said the gang had a shared interest in setting dogs on animals.

Phones found at Varey's house contained animal baiting videos, photographs of animals, and messages about 'doing holes', 'going out with the terriers' and 'going digging'.

The prosecutor said: ' We suggest that this is talking about about putting dogs down holes to get at animals.'

He said there were photographs showing a scarred dog, a dog with blood around its mouth, and a photograph of a fox and fox cub.

Mr Taylor said: 'We say this is evidence of Varey's fascination with using dogs to fight and cause injury to other animals.'

He said 
Varey kept dogs outside in cages and bred them 'to fight other animals 
in order to give pleasure to people like these defendants.'

He said Varey was in charge and also bred and sold dogs for profit.

When interviewed, Ashworth claimed he was only doing what he was told when he was shaking the tree a cat had run up the prosecutor said.

Mr Taylor said the cat was forced to run quickly up another tree to get away from the dogs, and said the cat would have been terrified.

Mr Taylor said when Varey was questioned, he didn't deny any responsibility for the film on his phone but made no comment. Mullens admitted it was his dog in the badger fight video.

Defending Varey, Gail Evans said it was his first animal welfare conviction.

Nick Cassidy, for Mullens, said the case had been 'a learning curve', and he apologised.

And Ashworth's lawyer, John Rusius, said: 'He does not accept being part of any group and does not share any passion for anything.'

Animal fights: Magistrates heard that Varey, who was the ringleader, kept and bred dogs for fighting

Varey
 and Mullens, who admitted causing an animal fight to take 
place, were disqualified from keeping or owning animals for ten years.  Varey was jailed for 126 days, while groundsman Mullens was sentenced to 114 days.

Ashworth, who admitted causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal, was sentenced to 76 days in prison.

The magistrates said: 'The cat was in fear of its life and you clearly appeared to be enjoying what was taking place.'

After the case, RSPCA Inspector Ian Briggs said: 'These men showed absolutely no regard for any of the animals, including their own dogs.

'This was cruelty in its most abhorrent form.'
