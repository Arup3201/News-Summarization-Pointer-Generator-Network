Murder: Lamarni Hylton-Reid died in hospital less than two hours after being knifed in London

A 20-year-old man was stabbed to death in an apparent row over £5.

Lamarni Hylton-Reid died in hospital less than two hours after being knifed in broad daylight.

Witnesses reported seeing two youths running from the scene in Homerton, East London, at around 5pm on Wednesday.

There have so far been no arrests.

The motive behind the killing is not yet known but Paulina Berry, who works at the nearby Adam and Eve pub, said: ‘The guys in the pub were talking about it last night. One said they heard the guy who got stabbed arguing with another guy over some money he owed them.’

She added: ‘They said it was just a fiver. I don’t know how they know that, which seems incredible. I don’t know if that is right.’

Resident Daniel Stanley, 36, said he saw two men running down a side road just after the stabbing.

'I didn’t see him get stabbed, but from my house I saw two black boys running away. They had hoods up and they were running quickly away from somewhere towards the Kingsmead Estate.

He added: ‘They had hoods up and they were running quickly away from somewhere. It is terrifying because I live here with my wife and daughter.’

Relatives of the victim – known as ‘Marni’ – left a floral tribute where he was killed.

Today friends on Twitter appeared to confirm the reason for the row.

Row: Locals said the row between youths may have been over an unpaid debt of just £5

One user, with the name Abbeycandy3, wrote: ‘RIP Lamarni Stabbed over a FIVER. What is wrong with people today???’

A local on the nearby Kingsmead Estate claims there have been gang tensions between youths from Homerton and Clapton, where Mr Hylton-Reid lived.

Asked whether they thought the attack may be gang related, a police spokesman said: ‘Officers are retaining an open mind as they continue investigations.’

Investigation: Police search for clues in Homerton, East London, following the stabbing on Wednesday 5pm
