A couple that had been married for 69 years will now get the chance to spend eternity together.

Giuseppe and Livia Fortuna of Stamford, Connecticut had a fairy tale romance, falling in love in Rome and getting married shortly before the end World War II, later having four children.

They moved to Stamford in the 60s and, tragically, 91-year-old Giuseppe passed away on Saturday.

So in love: Giuseppe and Livia Fortuna, who met in Rome and were married for 69 years

Eternal love: After Giuseppe passed away on Saturday, Livia died less than an hour later

Something shocking happened shortly after however, when his bride of 69 years, Livia, passed away less than an hour later.

They had both been living together at the Smith House Health Care Center. 

It was from a 'broken heart' her family members told the San Francisco Chronicle. 

'My mother was in shock to hear that my father had just died. She couldn't breathe and she was having a fit, even though she was on oxygen,' said Giuliana DiGeronimo, the couple's daughter.

'At the nursing home, everyone said they were angels. Everybody used to say how much they loved each other and how my father was always trying to help my mother.'

The couple's other daughter, Angela Munzenmaier, was actually on the phone with her mother when her father died, and had to deliver the horrible news.

'I told her she needed to be strong and that my dad had passed away. She started screaming his name and didn't want to talk and hung up the phone,' Munzenmaier said. 

Soon after, her brother got the call that their mother too had passed.

'They yelled and screamed at each other almost every day, but I think it was because they liked making up so much,' Munzenmaier said. 

'My mom was feisty. She wouldn't let my father get away with anything,'
