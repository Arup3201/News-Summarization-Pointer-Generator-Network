More than 30 firefighters were called to a property over the weekend to rescue a pony after it fell down a well.

Grace Hilliar de Alvaro became concerned about family pet Nova when she couldn't find the animal after a search with son Ignacio, six.

After looking through a number of fields they found the five-year-old pony stuck eight foot down a well and chest deep in water.

In happier times: Ignacio de Alvaro, 6, with Nova. His mother Grace is the pony's owner

Mrs Hilliar de Alvero, from Cary Fitzpaine, Somerset, called emergency services and around 35 firefighters attended the scene on Saturday morning.

One fire appliance from Yeovil and another from Castle Cary joined a specialist rescue team from Bridgwater at the rural scene.

The crew then requested further help from the service's urban search and rescue team in Exeter while an off-road vehicle was also drafted in.

Nova was eventually rescued six hours later and miraculously emerged from the well without a scratch.

Mrs Hilliar de Alvero, 47, said: 'We couldn't find Nova and we had spent a while looking around the fields and were worried she may have been taken or gone in the river.

Mob-handed: A total of 35 firefighters from three different stations were involved in the complicated rescue

The rescuers were forced to call in specialist lifting equipment from Exeter to winch Nova out

'She ended up down the well and it was very lucky she landed on her feet and not her back.

'Nova is a very sweet and unflappable little pony.

'She was calm and quiet, despite being stuck down a hole and covered up to her neck in cold water.

'We would love to thank the amazing team of more than 30 firefighters who came to Nova's rescue.'

A statement from Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue said: 'The Fire Service received a call to a pony stuck down a well.

'One fire appliance from Castle Cary, one fire appliance from Yeovil and the specialist rescue team from Bridgwater attended.

Free at last: Nova on dry land. Grace Hilliar de Alvaro first became concerned about the family pet when she struggled to find the animal

Good neigh-bours: Members of the local community were also instrumental in the six hour rescue of Nova

'Upon arrival, fire crews confirmed one pony trapped in an enclosed well approximately eight foot deep, up to its chest in water.

'Fire crews requested the attendance of specialist lifting equipment from the urban search and rescue team in Exeter.

'Fire crews removed a quantity of overgrown shrubs using handsaws and debris from around the well to assist access.

Family: Ignacio with his father, also called Ignacio, and Nova the pony. The younger Ignacio and his mother first became alarmed when Nova went missing and could not be found in nearby fields

Every boy's dream: Ignacio took the opportunity to get a picture with one of the rescue vehicles

'An off road vehicle was also requested to attend from Castle Cary.

'Fire crews erected a tripod and shoring equipment and lifted the pony from the well using strops.

'The pony was unharmed and led to safety.'

Susie Crang, who owns the land which Nova grazes on and helped free her, added: 'It was one of those crazy old things but luckily it had a happy ending.

'There were firefighters running all over the place. The pony couldn't have found a less accessible place if it tried.'
