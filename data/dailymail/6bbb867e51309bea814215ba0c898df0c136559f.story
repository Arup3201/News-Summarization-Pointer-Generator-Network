Jack Harper admits Gareth Bale is his inspiration at Real Madrid but the Scottish youngster was never starstruck and even offered to help the Welshman settle in at the Bernabeu.

Real academy prospect Harper was just 17 when Bale joined the club for £86million last summer.

Born in Spain to Scottish parents, striker Harper has been with Real since he was 13 and is used to rubbing shoulders with the likes of Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo and the rest of Carlo Ancelotti's star-studded European champions.

'It's an inspiration seeing them because that's obviously what I want to be in a year or two. There's nothing better than walking in and seeing Gareth Bale and Cristiano Ronaldo,' said Harper in an SFA interview ahead of Scotland Under 19s' European Championship qualifiers.

'When Gareth signed, I said to him "look, if you need any help or anyone to talk to I'm here".'

Bale did make a slow start in Spain despite a goal in his first game as injuries hampered his early progress, but 22 goals and a cup double capped a superb debut season. Now Harper hopes to follow in his footsteps.

'I've seen him a couple of times and hopefully in a year or two we'll be team-mates,' said the 18-year-old.

Harper stood out for the Madrid kids against Basle in the UEFA Youth League last month, scoring once, hitting the bar, smacking the post and forcing the keeper into a couple of smart saves in a 2-0 victory.

He is now on international duty with the young Scots facing Finland on Tuesday, Lithuania on Thursday and Norway on October 12.
