David Cameron and Barack Obama are plotting a G8 Summit showdown with Vladimir Putin over his support for Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.

The move comes as the Prime Minister said there was ‘credible evidence of multiple attacks using chemical weapons in Syria, including the use of the abhorrent agent sarin’.

He and Mr Obama will warn the Russian president they are prepared to contemplate military action in Syria unless he pulls the plug on the Assad regime.

Crisis talks: David Cameron is to hold talks with Barack Obama tonight over Syria’s use of chemical weapons

French President Francois Hollande 
and Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta will join the co-ordinated 
pincer movement against Mr Putin, who is the dictator’s only major ally.

In a pointed reference to Russia, one British source said: ‘The pressure is building now – and not just on Assad.’

Mr Cameron and President Obama were 
due to finalise their tactics in a phone call last night. The Prime 
Minister will then host Mr Putin for what are expected to be tense talks
in Downing Street tomorrow, ahead of next week’s two-day summit in 
Northern Ireland.

The diplomatic push comes amid 
growing revulsion at the Assad regime, and revelations it has been using
chemical weapons – a development described by President Obama as 
‘crossing a red line’.

The US says the Syrian government 
used the nerve agent sarin on two occasions in Aleppo on March 19 and 
April 13. US Ambassador Susan Rice detailed the attacks in a letter to 
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.

But in an ominous sign, Mr Putin’s 
senior foreign police adviser, Yuri Ushakov, hit back at the claims. He 
said: ‘I will say frankly that what was presented to us by the Americans
does not look convincing. It would be hard even to call them facts.’

The United States said it would 
provide ‘direct military aid’ to Syria’s rebels in the light of the new 
evidence. The US is also reported to be considering imposing a no-fly 
zone along Syria’s southern border with Jordan to protect civilians and 
rebel forces there from bombing raids by Assad’s forces.

Mr Cameron said yesterday that ‘no 
decision’ had been taken about whether Britain would send weapons to 
opposition forces in Syria.

But he added: ‘In our world today 
there is a brutal dictator who is using chemical weapons under our nose 
in a conflict where almost 100,000 people have already died. We must 
work with our allies and friends in the region to do everything we can 
to bring this dreadful conflict to an end.

‘There are concerns about some of the
opposition, but if we don’t engage with elements of the opposition and 
encourage those that do have a positive, pluralistic and democratic view
about the future of Syria, we won’t be able to influence the shape of 
that opposition.’

But intelligence officials have 
warned Mr Cameron that Britain could suffer ‘unacceptably high’ loss of 
aircraft during the early stages of any air strikes to enforce a no-fly 
zone.

They say Assad has sophisticated 
anti-aircraft systems supplied through Russia and Iran – far superior to
anything faced in Libya.

John Baron, one of dozens of Tory MPs
voicing fears about arming the rebels, said sending in more weapons 
‘can only create more suffering’. He said: ‘The UK does not have to 
follow the US. Good friends sometimes say to each other, “look, you’re 
making a mistake”.

Death toll: At least 93,000 people, including over 6,500 children, have been killed in Syria's civil war, the United Nations said on June 13, 2013, warning that the true death toll could be far higher
