Police have been dragged off the beat to work on the Olympics after dozens of G4S security guards failed to turn up for work, it emerged yesterday.

Just four of the 58 staff expected to report for duty at the Hilton Hotel in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, showed up, one of whom later disappeared.

In Salford, Greater Manchester, only 17 of the 56 G4S staff due at another Olympic team hotel could be bothered to present themselves for work.

Home Secretary Theresa May admitted yesterday that she has no idea how many G4S staff will turn up for work – raising the prospect that thousands more soldiers may have to be deployed, on top of the 3,500 who have already been called up.

‘The precise balance of the numbers that they will be providing will become clear over the next few days,’ she told MPs.

The political pressure was also growing last night as a series of leaked documents revealed that some officials have known of the problem for at least three months.

Mrs May claimed that ministers were told only last week that G4S could not deliver the 10,000 security guards it promised. But she was directly contradicted by London Mayor Boris Johnson, who said: ‘Everyone that was organising the Olympics knew this was coming up ages ago.’

An internal G4S memo leaked last night revealed that the company’s bosses deliberately failed to train people early because it would not be ‘cost-effective’.

In the document, obtained by Channel 4 News and dated June 29, Mark Hamilton, then head of Olympic security, wrote: ‘It would have been an advantage to have everyone trained months in advance but this was neither practical nor cost-effective.’

Gaps: Only 17 of an expected 56 G4S security staff turned up for work at the hotel, Greater Manchester Police Federation said

Yesterday, several hundred officers from nine police forces were being drafted in to plug gaps left by G4S.

West Midlands Police Federation chairman Ian Edwards said his force has had to provide 150 officers per day to cover a hotel in Warwickshire where Olympic footballers are staying, and could need to provide hundreds more at other venues.

He said: ‘It’s chaos, absolute chaos. You shouldn’t lose your local police officer because of the Olympics.’

The position of G4S chief executive Nick Buckles – due to give evidence to a Commons select committee today – looked increasingly perilous last night.

G4S could lose more than £700million of future Government work – including running prisons and police stations – after its reputation was tarnished by the debacle.

A collapse in its share price has seen some £600million wiped from the value of the company since the guard shortfall emerged last week, and it has already admitted it will make a £50million loss on the Olympics contract.

City analyst Mike Allen, of broking house Panmure Gordon, said: ‘I’m sure that one or two heads are going to have to roll for this.’

G4S chairman John Connolly said: ‘We don’t want to do anything that smacks of short-term expediency, but it would be right to consider whether any members of the senior team are best placed to take the company forward.’

But Mr Buckles could walk away with a bulging pension pot and company shares worth £21million.

Downing Street confirmed that the Government’s Cobra crisis committee would now meet every day – often under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister – throughout the Olympics to prevent further security disasters.

Last night it emerged that officials were sufficiently worried to commission an audit of whether G4S could deliver on its promises.

A source told ITV news the audit was seen by the Home Office and Games organisers Locog.

The audit dated April 23, said: ‘Clearly the training operation is very frustrated at not being able to put through the required numbers, and viewing with trepidation the inevitable last-minute nature of the mass throughput that will be the consequence.’

The audit found that attendance at training events was just 60 per cent of ‘planned capacity.'

Last laugh? Mr Buckles could take home a package
 of up to £21million in bonuses, shares and pension if he is forced to 
quit the company over the guard-recruitment fiasco

With just ten days until the opening 
ceremony, senior police officers are said to be ‘extremely concerned’ 
not only about the absence of so many G4S staff – but also about the 
poor quality of those who turn up.

Insiders have claimed that scores of 
guards are poorly trained, speak little or no English and blundered 
during training sessions.

Clive Chamberlain, chairman of Dorset 
Police Federation, said: ‘My biggest fear is that G4S are now 
panic-recruiting people to get as many people as they can into the 
organisation. What proper training will they have had before they start?
 It’s very, very worrying.’

 G4S said security was still being 
‘tightened’ at various venues around the country before the ‘full 
complement’ of accredited staff are assigned.

Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper 
said: ‘It is incomprehensible that with 11 days to go the Home Secretary
 still doesn’t know how many staff G4S are likely to provide.’
