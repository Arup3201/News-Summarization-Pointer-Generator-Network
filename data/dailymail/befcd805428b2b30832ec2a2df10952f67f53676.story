Standing proud and grappling like Hulk Hogan this one legged wrestler is celebrating a season of winning.

Champion, Anthony Robles from Arizona, has not only defeated his rivals in the ring but overcame a mysterious condition that left him born without a right leg.Â 

With a special technique of wrestling from the floor the 125lbs wrestler is able to use his body to such effect that some of his opponents even claim that having only one leg has given him an advantage in the ring.

'I succeed because I put the work and extra effort in,' explained the 23-year-old.

'My coach always says that you know you're getting somewhere when people start saying negative things about you,

'So I guess I got somewhere. I see it as a compliment to me, it shows me I made it.'

The 23-year-old's special technique sees him start on the ground and work his way up

Despite his disability Mr Robles became interested in basketball, baseball, American football and soccer as a child and then switched to wrestling at the age of 14.

Now he is U.S. National Collegiate Athletic Association champion after an undefeated season in 2011.

'My mom raised me to be strong and proud of who I am,' he continued.

'I didn't see having one leg as a curse, or that it should hold me back. I know I was made this way for a reason.

'I always did the best with what I had and I have come out on top despite how I was born.

'I am proof that anything is possible.'
