Seattle Seahawks star Kevin Norwood surprised his girlfriend by proposing to her in front of a packed hall full of spectators at her Senior Night gymnastics meet in Alabama on Friday.

Norwood and Kayla Williams have been together for three years after meeting at the University of Alabama, where she is still a student. 

Wide receiver Norwood, who moved to Seattle last year and said that it was spending time apart from Kayla that had inspired him to propose to her. 

On bended knee: Seattle Seahawks star Kevin Norwood surprised his girlfriend on Friday night by proposing to her in front of a packed hall full of spectators at her Senior Night gymnastics meet in Alabama on Friday

'Being in Seattle by myself and not knowing anyone and stuff like that, I just had more time to think to myself of what I really wanted in life, so that was pretty much the game-changer for me,' he told AL.com. 

'I've known for awhile that I wanted to be with her and stay with her for the rest of my life.'

Norwood had started planning for the big moment months ago with the help of Alabama gymnastics coach Dana Duckworth.

The NFL star handed out post-meet awards and posed for a picture with Kayla and Duckworth before getting down on one knee and proposing to Kayla to loud cheers from the audiance. 

A very surprised Kayla said yes. Friday night's very public proposal was totally unexpected as Kevin is normally a much more reserved person.

'For him to do that in front of that many people was a surprise to me,' said Kayla. 'That's not how I expected it to happen.'
