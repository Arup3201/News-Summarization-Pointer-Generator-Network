An autistic man was awarded $2.5million in damages by after an antipsychotic drug he took as a boy led him to grow enormous breasts, Philadelphia common pleas court said.

The  jury concluded on Tuesday that Austin Pledger, 20, 'was not adequately warned' that he would grow size 46DD breasts as a side effect of taking Risperdal, produced by Johnson & Johnson subsidiary Janssen Pharmeceuticals.

Pledger's mother, Benita Pledger, testified about the breasts' impact on her son's life and how they affected his self confidence, the man's lawyer, Thomas Kline said. 

Though he began producing breasts shortly after he started taking the medication in 2002 when he was eight years old, Pledger, from Thorsby, Alabama, has yet to have a mastectomy.

Austin Pledger, 20, was awarded $2.5million in damages after he grew size 46DD breasts as a side effect of Risperdal, an antipsychotic medication he took when he was a boy

Risperdal was approved for the use in children in 2006, though Pledger started using the drug at age eight in 2002. Its FDA label in 2006 warned of high levels of prolactin, a hormone that promotes breast growth

'The testimony of his mother before the jury is he would smash them on a table,' Kline told People.

'And that when he gets out of the shower he covers himself in a towel before he looks at himself in a mirror.' 

The medication, which had not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration that was prescribed by his family physician had a label that said the risk of gynecomastia - the condition that causes men to grow female breasts - was low,  Kline said.

The FDA approved the use of Risperdal as a schizophrenic aid for children in 2006, and warned that it was high levels of prolactin, which is a hormone that promotes breast growth, according to Philly.com.

Since Pledger had been taking the drug for four years, he had already began to develop female-like breasts, which now can only be removed through a mastectomy, the court heard.

Kline said that Pledger's mother 'had no idea' the drug was associated with the growth of breasts.

'Austin is among the most vulnerable and precious in our world,' he told People. 'These decisions are difficult and even more so when the child is frail, like Austin, so his mom has been very slow and patient.'

Pledger's doctor, Jay Mathissen, testified that he, too, was unaware that gynecomastia was a side effect of the drug.   

A spokeswoman for Janssen Pharmaceuticals said the company is 'disappointed' with the outcome of the hearing and believes the 'verdict should be overturned'. 

She claimed that the side effects of Risperdal were clearly communicated to Pledger, his family and doctor. 

Robyn Reed, the company's director of product communication, said Pledger's 'quality of life was significantly improved during the time he was taking Risperdal'.

She added that the FDA-approved label on the drug 'properly warned' the family 'of the medication's potential side effects'. 

Pledger's case is the first of more than 1,200 filed over Risperdal in Philadelphia, according to Kline.
