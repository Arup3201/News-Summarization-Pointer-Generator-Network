Kim Sears bought some sunshine to Wimbledon today as she took her seat on court one wearing a vibrant canary yellow dress.

Rain would have delayed play for her boyfriend Andy Murray but the skies reflected her choice of outfit as the Brit took on Yen-Hsun Lu.

Kim teamed her yellow dress with a denim jacket and wedge sandals and carried her trusty Mulberry bag as she cheered and clapped her partner on to victory in his second round match.

Doesn't court publicity: The artist said she and Andy usually avoid the limelight

The 25-year-old may have carried a designer bag but she is known for her love of the British High Street, often wearing garments from Topshop and Hobbs to Andy's matches.

Kim was joined by Andy's father, Will, while his mother, Judy, and Andy's best friend, Ross Hutchins, 28, who is currently battling cancer, were also there offering their support.

Earlier this month at Queen's Andy organised fundraising tennis tournaments in support of cancer charities in honour of his former doubles partner.

Kim, an artist specialising in animal portraits, was happy to pose for photographers as she arrived on court one today. But on the BBC documentary Andy Murray: The Man Behind the Racquet, broadcast on Sunday night, she said she doesn't normally court the lime light.

She added that photographers don't tend to stalk her and Andy too much over the Wimbledon fortnight because the couple, who own two dogs, are 'too boring'.

Andy, 26, explained: 'The last few Wimbledons they used to wait outside the house to see what we're doing on my off days and after the fourth or fifth dog walk they realised it was a waste of time so they don't come back anymore!'

Meanwhile on centre court... Mo Farah and Carole and Michael Middleton were spectators in the royal box

However the couple have proved they have a great sense of humour with their Twitter account set up in their dog Maggie's name, who currently has more than 17,000 followers.

While Andy's off court life might not impress photographers his tennis moves are continuing to wow viewers as he won the first two sets 6-3, 6-3 while the last was closer at 7-5.

As he was on court one rather the centre court today those in the royal box, including Michael and Carole Middleton and Olympian Mo Farah, were not able to cheer him on.

Andy credited Mo earlier this year, as well as Jessica Ennis and Greg Rutherford, with giving him some extra fire power to go on and win his own Olympic gold medal as he said he was inspired by their victories on Super Saturday.Â
