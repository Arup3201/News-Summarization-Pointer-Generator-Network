Even the most hardened insomniac would struggle to count all the sheep at Britains' biggest one day lamb market.

Hundreds of farmers from all over the nation flock to Lazonby Mart in Cumbria to inspect some of the best lambs in the land.

An estimated 17,500 mule gimmer lambs, from the upland and hillfarms of northern England, went under the hammer at one of the biggest events in the farming calender.

The lambs, largely born and bred on the Lakeland Fells, the Pennines and Alston Moors, are highly prized for their ability to thrive and for their prime meat.

And with an average of 1750 lambs an hour leaping through the ring, the auctioneers were selling at breakneck speed from 9.30am until 7.30pm.

The mule sheep, a cross-breed from a Swaledale ewe and Bluefaced Leicester ram, are noted for being good mothers, often producing two lambs, and for their hardiness.

However, the harsh winter and spring have taken their toll on even their sturdy stock. Richard Hodgson, foreman at Lazonby Mart, said: 'We have around 17,500 lambs on the catalogue, which is 1600 down on last year.

'There are a lot less lambs, which is due to a bad winter followed by a terrible spring. More lambs were lost but mostly it was due to more single lambs being born rather than twins.

By the end of the day, farmers were expected expected to have paid somewhere around £1.75m for the animals

'We are expecting prices to be a bit down on last year's trade because there isn't a lot of money flying about in the farming industry at the moment. There isn't the money about because it was an expensive winter.'

He said last year's cold and wet summer resulted in poor crops, which in turn led to higher feed prices.

He added: 'The price of feed went up from £160 to £250 a ton and with it being such a bad winter, more of it was needed, so times are tougher.

'Fortunately we've had a wonderful summer this year, the harvest is in and the hay and farmers are now on with their potatoes, so hopefully it bodes well for next year.'

In pre-19th century England and Wales, the majority of the population made their living through agriculture and livestock farming.

Most people lived where they worked, in the fields far from towns, so farmers and their families herded cattle and hauled their produce to markets in nearby towns.

Since many livestock are herd animals, they were historically driven to market 'on the hoof' to a town or other central location.

Market towns became so important to rural life it was incorporated into their names, such as Market Drayton, Market Harborough, Market Deeping and Market Weighton.

As traditional market towns developed, they had a wide main street or central market square for people to set up stalls, booths and display livestock for auction.

A rich social scene grew up around the auctions, with farmers often descending upon taverns in their droves before, after and during the selling.

The event was always well-attended and anticipated by the sheep farming community, although it wasn't as much of a social event as it was in decades past

Mr Hodgson, 62, said the event was always well attended and looked forward to by the sheep farming community although it wasn't as much of a social event as it was in decades past.

He said: 'It's more business-like now - people still like to meet up and have a good chat but there's not the same craic and the characters there used to be.

'Farmers used to arrive the night before and meet up in the pub, there was a lot of banter. It's more workmanlike now and there are fewer "characters" than there were.

'However, it's still a good day out. Hopefully everyone will come and buy some good lambs and go home happy!'

The highly sought-after lambs are mainly from hill farms giving them a glowing reputation for thriving when moved to other parts of the country
