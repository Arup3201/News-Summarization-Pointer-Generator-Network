A four-month-old baby suffered 13 broken ribs and three skull fractures as a result of five separate incidents before her death, her inquest has heard.   

Evie Grace Thomas died on February 21, 2013 at the Royal Albert Edward Infirmary in Wigan. A full CT scan, reviewed by two radiologists, discovered numerous existing injuries. 

Her father, Martin Thomas, 30, was acquitted of assaulting the young baby at an earlier trial at Liverpool Crown Court. 

The inquest heard that the injuries suffered by Evie, pictured, could have happened over five occasions

Martin Thomas had his daughter's hand print tattooed onto his chest following her death in February 2013

The infant suffered from Treacher Collins syndrome which affected the development of her facial bones.  

Medical investigations found that Evie Grace was injured in five separate incidents, with a belief that the fractures could have been caused by 'squeezing or standing or stamping on the ribs by an adult'. 

However, medics admitted that the string of injuries did not contribute to Evie Grace's death.  

The inquest in Bolton heard that Evie Grace suffered the same genetic illness as her father. She also suffered from colic which caused her pain, distress and discomfort. 

Dr Phillip Lumb, forensic pathologist said: 'There were many rib fractures on both sides of her chest and these were of varying ages. There was no disease process that would have made her more vulnerable to rib fractures and there was no accident explanation from the materials reviewed.

'The pattern of ribs fractures is suggestive of multiple physical assault. These look like rib fractures as a consequence of direct hard blows or hard tight gripping. Rib fractures can cause problems with breathing that are harmful and may have an influence on someone’s death.'

The inquest was told six of the thirteen rib fractures may have happened in the week leading up to her death and Dr Lumb added: 'They were of three different ages and caused by the application of blunt force. The force required would be quite considerable.'

The inquest was told Evie had been previously admitted to hospital in December 2012 after suffering a 'massive lump' to her head while in the charge of her father.

Thomas later claimed while he had been downstairs changing her nappy on a foot stool another small child fell on her and a toy telephone she was holding hit his daughter on the head. But Dr Lumb said: 'I examined the explanation in detail. It was my opinion that the incident described initially had not caused the skull fracture. I didn’t think it was plausible as a cause of the skull fracture. You need considerable impact to fracture a child’s skull.'

He told the inquest Evie Grace may have died from 'non-accidental upper airway obstruction' and added: 'For example by smothering. It cannot be excluded as a cause of death. It may not leave any signs. Upper airway obstruction by smothering cannot be excluded as a potential cause of death.

'Rib fractures are a cause of pneumonia. The chest can become painful with rib fractures and it causes breathing difficulties. Rib fractures may be one of the main causes of death in this case.'

Thomas from Worsley Hall, Wigan, stood trial last October at Liverpool Crown Court during which prosecutors said it was believed the skull fractures suffered by Evie Grace were 'likely to have been caused by hitting her head against a flat surface or striking her head with a blunt instrument.' But he was acquitted of five charges of causing grievous bodily harm with intent between November 26, 2012 and February 22 last year.

Mr Thomas said after his trial he had undergone 'two years of hell' until he was finally acquitted by the jury

The inquest heard that Evie, pictured, had been found unresponsive in her Moses basket on the day she died

Detective Superintendent  Peter Jackson of Greater Manchester Police said: 'We know from both Martin and Hayley at 6am on 21st of February Martin returned home after a night shift working at the Heinz factory. He came home and when he arrived Evie was upstairs and when he came in he would go and collect her and take her down stairs. From his account he said he had been playing with her for an hour.'

He said Thomas told officers he put Evie in a Moses basket face down claiming he was told to lay her left cheek laying down on the mattress. But when he checked her again at 9.45am her face was fully facing into the mattress at which point she was unresponsive and the ambulance was called. She died in hospital. Miss Fisher was also arrested but released without charge.

Mr Jackson added: 'The CPS reviewed the case and evidence and we received advice to charge Martin Thomas. On 20th July we were contacted by prosecution counsel stating that Martin’s defence team had accepted guilty pleas to lesser offences. Martin accepted a momentary loss of control, but this was rejected by the CPS. They said a charge on the basis of momentary loss of control did not reflect the series of assaults.

'He went to a full not guilty trial and blamed Hayley. The jury acquitted him of all the charges and the cause of death remained unascertained.'

Recording an open verdict coroner Jennifer Leeming said: 'During her life Evie had sustained serious injuries and Dr Lumb detailed the force needed to inflict these injuries. 

'What can be said for certain is that there is no realistic explanation for how that child in her short life sustained 13 rib fractures and three skull fractures.'

Mr Thomas waited until Miss Fisher and her family left the court before departing without comment

After the hearing Thomas waited until Miss Fisher and her family left the court before departing without comment.

In an interview with his local newspaper after his acquittal he said: 'It’s all such a big relief. All I ever wanted to do, and set out to do, was prove my innocence and now I have done that.

'I’ve been beaten up on the street and called names and for the last 20 months I’ve been stuck in the house. I had to leave my job and I’ve been suicidal, I tried taking my own life. You just wouldn’t believe how much of a weight off my shoulders it actually is. No-one can ever imagine or come close to imagining how I’ve felt unless they go through it themselves.

'I can now finally walk around the streets without looking over my shoulder and I can actually grieve properly for my daughter without any stress on my back. I was scared of people thinking I had done something. Now I don’t have to worry about that.'

Mr Thomas denied he ever offered to accept a plea in connection with his earlier assault case. 

Miss Fisher said following the hearing: 'I feel I have been failed by the justice system - I just kept hoping that we would get some answers and we will get justice one day.'
