A furious row erupted in Italy today over claims the government paid Islamic extremists a £9million ransom to free two aid workers held  in Syria.

Greta Ramelli, 20, and Vanessa Marzullo, 21, flew back to Rome this morning after they were captured by militants believed to be from Al-Qaeda affiliated group Jabhat al-Nusra in August.

News of their return was applauded in Parliament, but also drew heavy criticism from opposition politicians after Arab media reports suggested a ransom of 12 million euros (£9m) had been paid.

European governments including Italy have long tolerated or facilitated ransom payments to secure the release of hostages although the practice has frequently been denied officially. 

The leader of the Northern League party, Matteo Salvini, said on Twitter: 'If the government really paid a ransom of 12million euros to free the two friends of the Syrians, it would be disgusting!'

Lucio Malan, a senior member of the centre-right Forza Italia party, said the government should explain whether a ransom had been paid.

If it were paid 'to save two valuable lives, then thousands of others -- equally valuable -- would be put at risk,' Malan said in a statement.

A ransom payment 'would encourage terrorists, illegitimate entities like the so-called caliphate and simple criminals to take Italians hostage, wherever they may be,' he added. 

Foreign Minister Paolo Gentiloni dismissed the claims as 'baseless', but did not deny directly that a payment had take place.

He told the lower house that Italy is 'against payment of ransom' and follows 'the rules and behaviours' shared by the international community. 

But he added: 'When it comes to Italians taken hostage, our priority is focused on saving their lives and the physical integrity of our compatriots.' 

The issue has taken on unusual prominence after Islamist gunmen killed 17 people in Paris and a day after Belgian police killed two men during a raid on an apparently separate Islamist group. 

The pair are welcomed by Italy's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Paolo Gentiloni (left) at Ciampino airport in Rome. The foreign ministry said yesterday their release was the result of 'intense work by team Italy' but officials have not revealed whether a ransom was paid or exactly how they came to be freed.

A report in the New York Times last year said Al Qaeda and its affiliates had made at least $125 million from kidnap ransoms since 2008, most from European governments making payments through proxies.

The women, from Lombardy in northern Italy, disappeared on July 31 near Aleppo in northern Syria three days after they arrived from Turkey. 

They were captured by militants believed to be from Al-Qaeda affiliated group Jabhat al-Nusra in August while distributing aid in Aleppo. 

Wearing faint smiles and with their heads bowed, the women were rushed into the airport hall without a word or even a nod towards the press. 

The pair were to be taken to hospital for a check-up and then to see Rome's anti-terrorist prosecution office, which has opened an investigation into their abduction.  

'I'm feeling such enormous joy: this is the news I have been waiting for for a long time,' Salvatore Marzullo, father of Vanessa, said from his restaurant in Verdello near Bergamo in northern Italy, after news of their release.

'I am so, so happy,' he told the AGI news agency.

On Twitter, Interior Minister Angelino Alfano welcomed the news 'with great joy and a huge sigh of relief.' 

Ramelli and Marzullo were captured by gunmen in Aleppo province while working for the aid group Horryaty, which specialises in health and clean water projects. 

They were last heard of on December 31 when a video was posted online showing them dressed in black robes and headscarves and urging the Italian government to do everything it could to bring them home.

The posting on YouTube was entitled 'Al-Nusra Front detains two Italian employees because of their government's participation in the coalition against it.'

But the video was not posted on any official accounts belonging to Al-Nusra, which is Al-Qaeda's Syrian affiliate.

Italy's foreign ministry has given little away about who it thought was holding the women but had denied reports they were prisoners of the Islamic State group.

The liberation of the two women leaves two Italians unaccounted for in conflict zones overseas. 

Jesuit priest Paolo Dall'Oglio was kidnapped in Syria in July 2013 and aid worker Giovanni Lo Porto disappeared in the tribal zones between Pakistan and Afghanistan in January 2012. 

Both men are feared dead.

Italy last year secured the release of two construction workers held in Libya and the country has a track record of paying ransoms to get its citizens home safely.

That approach has been controversial with some of its NATO allies, chiefly Britain and the United States, who argue that handing over cash only encourages further abductions and can end up funding terror attacks.

In theory, Italy signed up to not paying ransoms at a NATO summit in September 2014 but media reports suggested money changed hands in the Libya cases.

Italian officials were able to portray the Libya kidnappings as essentially criminally motivated rather than being the work of hardened terrorists. 

But that stance may be harder to maintain if it emerges that the two women had been in the grasp of either Al-Nusra or Islamic State.
