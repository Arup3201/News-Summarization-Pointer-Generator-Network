It is a game usually played in near silence and at a sedate pace.

But the usually serene chess community has been rocked by allegations that a mother and her three schoolboy sons, representing England at a European youth tournament, were subjected to a barrage of racial abuse.

Even worse, the abuse is alleged to have come from members of the English delegation who were supposed to be supporting Muslim player Yousuf bin-Suhayl, 13, and his brothers Ibraheem, 10, and Ieysaa, aged seven.

Yesterday the siblings’ parents, Sohale 
Rahman and Tomasina Contu, told how tensions became so heated the family
had to be escorted back to their hotel by police.

The English Chess Federation is now probing the astonishing claims of physical, verbal and racist abuse at the European Union Youth Championships in Mureck, Austria last week.

It is claimed that two parents of other English children in the tournament were harassing and abusing Miss Contu in the stands.

One of those involved is said to have forcefully grabbed Yousuf by the chest, causing him to bleed.

The family, from Marshland St James, Norfolk, had travelled to central Europe so the three boys could represent their country in the chess competition during their school holidays.

Mr Rahman, 43, also said that the boys were not provided halal food, as requested before the competition, and were given cold boiled eggs and ‘bits of bread’ to eat while other team members indulged in a buffet.

The English Chess Federation is now probing the astonishing claims of racist behaviour within the usually serene game community.

Mr Rahman said: ‘I pleaded with the English Chess Federation (ECF) to take action for the security of my family but in vain. We believe the ECF has failed in their duty of care.’

The ECF have said they are taking the allegations very 'seriously'.

Andrew Farthing, ECF chief executive, said: “We are aware of certain allegations which have been made concerning the behaviour of some of the members of the English delegation at this tournament.

‘The federation is taking the situation very seriously and are investigating if there is any truth in the allegations and witness statements are currently being sought.’

Mr Rahman, said his wife and eldest son Yousuf bin-Suhayl, 13, cannot sleep properly after being ‘bullied’ at the championships.

They spent the whole trip, which cost the family £3,000, sat at a separate table from the rest of the English party as they were always drinking alcohol.

He believes Yousuf, who got an A* in A Level maths at the age of 12, should have won the competition, but he came third.

He said: ‘My wife and eldest son cannot sleep - they are traumatised. It was bullying.

‘The other parents said my wife was not educated because she chooses to cover her head.

‘They told her to F*** off. They would stand in front of her. And ask ‘where do you think you are going?’.

‘They set out to intimidate her.

‘One parent said ‘what is that stench’ after she had walked into the room.

He added: ‘She was stuck because the people she was trying to complain about where socialising with the people she needed to complain to.’

The worst incident was when a mother grabbed Yousuf on his chest leaving bleeding nail marks.

Mr Rahman said: ‘That is child abuse. All he did was walk around her.’

Mr Rahman said no Halal food had been arranged for his family or provisions for them to eat at times to fit in with Ramadan fasting.

He said: 'The first day at dawn there was no food. And the place where the food was kept was locked.’

He added: ‘My wife and I felt helpless as parents being unable to feed our children.’

He has complained to British police and Norfolk Police are arranging to take a statement from him.

He said: 'We just want justice.'

A spokesman from the English Chess Federation said: The ECF has completed a thorough investigation into the events that took place at the European Union Youth Chess Championships in Mureck, Austria.

'The investigation obtained statements from eye-witnesses.  It concluded that the allegations of racist or Islamophobic abuse and of a physical attack are unfounded. 

The report found that there was a disagreement amongst the families of the England team that resulted from complaints of perceived disruptive behaviour by individual children.  There is no evidence that racism or religious intolerance played any part.

'The claims concerning provision of suitable food during the event are inconsistent with both the facts and the extensive efforts made by the tournament organisers, hotel management and ECF Head of Delegation to ensure that the requirements of all members of the England delegation were met.

'The ECF takes any charge of racism or religious intolerance extremely seriously and we absolutely condemn discriminatory behaviour of any kind. The ECF is also committed to the safety of all competitors who take part in tournaments at home and abroad.'
