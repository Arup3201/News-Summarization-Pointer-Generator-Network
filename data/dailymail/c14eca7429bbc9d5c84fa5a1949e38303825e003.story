Amal Clooney used her first Golden Globes red carpet to make a political statement - pinning a 'je suis Charlie' button on her Dior handbag in support of France following a series of terrorist attacks last week.

Mrs Clooney was joined by her husband George and several other stars who flashed the viral phrase for cameras. 

'I am Charlie' is a statement of solidarity with Charlie Hebdo, the satirical magazine where eight journalists were murdered - along with two policemen and two bystanders - by Islamist fanatics last weekend.

Dame Helen Mirren, Kathy Bates and  Diane Kruger also voiced their support.

Proudly: Helen Mirren used the Golden Globes to show her support for the French people following the recent terrorist attacks in Paris

German actress Diane Kruger and partner Joshua Jackson also held up a 'je suis Charlie' at the Golden Globes 

Film producer Harvey Weinstein wrote in a Variety column that he hopes stars use the Golden Globes as a chance to pledge solidarity with French journalists who were killed last week.

'There's always champagne on the table. I hope we can all raise glasses and that someone like Tina, Amy or George Clooney will urge us to toast with 300 million viewers around the world: 'Je suis Charlie, je suis juif, je suis Ahmed,' he wrote.

Mrs Clooney, a British human rights lawyer, told Elle that she was wearing a Dior gown and carrying a handbag that was 'customized in solidarity with the French people who've gone through a terrible week.'

Dame Helen Mirren also used the Golden Globes as a golden opportunity to give her verdict on the Paris terrorist attacks.

The dazzling 69-year-old also noticeably had a pen pinned to her stunning red dress.  

While Dame Helen is yet to officially speak out about the tragedy, the defiant smile she wore while holding the poster spoke volumes.

The actress was of course at the Golden Globes as she had been put forward for the Best Actress in a Motion Picture award in the comedy or musical category.

Not alone: Actors Kathy Bates, Joshua Jackson and Diane Kruger also held up signs and smartphones with ‘Je Suis Charlie’ to show support for victims of the deadly attack

She had secured a nomination for her performance as Madame Mallory in the hilarious blockbuster The Hundred Foot Journey.

However, despite the praise she received from critics for her role, the star faced stiff competition from Amy Adams, Emily Blunt, Julianne Moore and Quvenzhané Wallis for the prestigious gong.

A string of famous faces joined Dame Helen at the Golden Globes including Jennifer Lopez, Keira Knightley and Catherine Zeta-Jones.

Talented: The actress was at the Golden Globes as she had been put forward for the Best Actress in a Motion Picture award in the comedy or musical category

While some stars decided not to follow in Dame Helen's footsteps by commenting on the recent terrorist attacks, several did.

Actors Kathy Bates, Joshua Jackson and Diane Kruger held up signs and smartphones with ‘Je Suis Charlie’ to show support for victims of the deadly attack last week.

Meanwhile, George Clooney, who will receive a lifetime achievement award, wore a lapel pin with the same phrase while his wife Amal Alamuddin had her purse customized with the slogan.
