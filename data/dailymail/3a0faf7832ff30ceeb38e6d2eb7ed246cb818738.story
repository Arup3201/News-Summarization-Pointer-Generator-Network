British women aged 18-25 care more about 'looking good' than climbing the career ladder, according to a new survey.

The study, which asked single women to rank aspects of their life, found 41 per cent were more concerned about their appearance than how well their job was going.

One in five admitted prospects, promotions and pay rises meant less to them than having 'perfect hair', fashionable clothes and good make up.

As many as one in four admitted they would rather look like Frankie Sandford from The Saturdays than be as successful as businesswoman Karren Brady.

The study also showed many women prioritise 'great hair' and 'staying thin' over renting or owning their own place and learning to drive.

Settling down and starting a family was way down the modern women's list of priorities - in line with recent NHS statistics that revealed more women are delaying motherhood till their 30s and 40s.

The top priority for the 539 women questioned was going out with friends.

A spokeswoman for haircare company John Frieda, which conducted the study, said it 'stands to reason' that young women today are more concerned with their
looks and friendships in an era when social networking means more 
pictures are shared online and rising house prices have made buying a 
first home impossible.

They said: 'It stands to reason that 
women of a young age will be more concerned about their looks, 
friendships and socialising than other more serious aspects.

'As a young woman appearance is 
incredibly important - from looking fantastic for a night on the town, 
to checking pictures on Facebook, it is the thing at the forefront of 
these girls minds.

'The other thing to consider is that for some girls, the prospect of owning a house, settling down, and paying into pensions are seemingly unachievable at present, so they're things which are easy to forget about.'

The poll also found 45 per cent of young single women spend more on making sure they look good, rather than saving for the future.

The average girl in her early twenties 
spends Â£90 a month on her appearance - splashing out most of her 
disposable income on haircuts, tans, clothes and shoes.

One in three get their hair cut frequently, one in ten often top up the tan, and one fifth have their nails manicured regularly.

But for one third of girls, looking amazing has nothing to do with bagging a boyfriend - as they'd prefer to impress their friends than a man with their appearance.

When it comes to planning for the future, young women are burying their heads in the sand with 58 per cent preferring to think about the here and now instead.

For almost 44 per cent of single ladies, having fun with friends is more important than making plans for a secure and steady future.

One fifth of girls can't ever imagine being in the position where they'll be able to afford to buy a house, while two in three would like to have a house but can't see it being in the near future.

The John Frieda spokeswoman added: 'It is incredible girls would rather have beautiful coloured hair and the High Street's latest outfits than a pension in place, their own car, or their own house.

'But this is because when you are in your early twenties appearance is of huge importance - and before life gets too serious and stressful, why should it be any other way.'
