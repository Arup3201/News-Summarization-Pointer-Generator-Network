Two thugs battered a factory worker in the street and robbed him of 80p while dressed as a tiger and a red devil.

Fancy dress duo Fred Dixon, 18, and David Aston-Brown, 20, pounced on Roger Brookes, 37, in the early hours of August 20.

The pair shouted at Mr Brookes as he made
his way to work at a plant in Hereford before 
snatching his rucksack, a court has heard.

Security cameras captured the thugs punching him to the floor, causing him to cut his head.

Dixon then put Mr Brookes in a head-lock so Aston-Brown could kick him in the chest, Worcester Crown Court heard.

After emptying their victim’s bag on 
the floor the thugs made off with just 80p, a key ring and a
work clocking-in card.

The pair were jailed for three years each on Monday.

Sentencing the pair from Whitecross, Hereford, Judge John Cavell said: 'This was determined street violence on a complete stranger.

'You stole property that was almost trifling in its value, but caused serious harm to your victim.'

When police released CCTV images of the thugs in August, it was originally thought they were dressed as cats.

But before they were sentenced it was revealed Dixon wore a tiger-print all-in-one suit, while Aston-Brown was dressed as a red devil.

Defending Dixon, Michael Aspinall said the men had got drunk, dressed up and gone out to 'mess around'.

He added: 'These were two heavily intoxicated young men had gone out, in Fred Dixon’s case in breach of a curfew, but not to commit offences.'

The court heard Dixon had previous convictions for battery, common assault, sexual assault, criminal damage and an attempted robbery.

While Aston-Brown had previous convictions for racially aggravated public disorder, battery against an ex-girlfriend and handling stolen goods.

Dixon had only been released from a youth detention centre less than two weeks before the incident.

Speaking after the case, Detective Sergeant Tim Powell from Hereford Police said: 'The case was solved thanks to the media reports and members of the public coming forward to give information that led us to CCTV footage which positively identified the suspects, leaving them with no option but to plead guilty.'

Both men had pleaded guilty to robbery at an earlier hearing.
