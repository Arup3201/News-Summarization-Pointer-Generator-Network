The U.S. Coast Guard searched the waters between the Bahamas and South Florida on Sunday looking for a man who reportedly jumped over a cruise ship railing.

James Miller, a 30-year-old man from Charleston, South Carolina, reportedly jumped over a railing on the Bahamas Celebration, CBS Miami says.

Guard spokeswoman Sabrina Laberdesque said the man apparently went overboard early on Sunday in waters about 27 miles (43 kilometers) east of Florida's Delray Beach.

He was reported missing from the ship at about 2 a.m. as it was returning to its home port in Florida, she said. The vessel, owned by Fort Lauderdale-based Celebration Cruise Line, sailed from Grand Bahama island on Saturday evening.

Few details of the disappearance have been released.

The ship's crew turned the liner around to search for the man once he was reported missing.

'We are very disappointed that something like this occurred,' Celebration Cruise Line spokesman Glenn Ryerson said during a brief phone interview.

Two air crews as well as a boat crew searched for Miller on Sunday, according to Local10.

About two years ago, a 47-year-old Canadian woman went missing off the Bahamas Celebration as it was returning to Florida. Coast Guard crews called off their search for the woman after covering an area of some 7,300 square miles.

The Bahamas Celebration is a six-deck cruise ship that can hold 1,250 passengers in 502 cabins. It was introduced in 2009 and offers two-night cruises to the Bahamas archipelago off Florida's east coast.
