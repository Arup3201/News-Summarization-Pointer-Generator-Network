There's no doubt Kendall Jenner has been the darling of Paris Fashion Week this season.

The brunette reality star-turned-supermodel has been spotted at Chanel, Balmain, H&M and every glitzy fashion party thrown. And always wearing a pair of towering heels.

The 19-year-old catwalk star has picked up a few tricks to surviving all night (and day) in uncomfortably high heels on her travels around the world's red carpets, and now she's sharing them with us.

So it seems Kendall Jenner gets Kim Kardashian's hand me downs...

This cute velvet look on Kendall was first seen on Kim yesterday as she attended the Balmain AW15 show, even before it had been strutted down the catwalk by a model. But clearly Kendall took one look and decided she was going to rock it herself to the after party.

And while the half-sisters have very different body shapes they both looked gorgeous in this vampish ensemble. It looks like a dress but is a top and skirt and we love the ruffles and slightly Gothic vibe.

And of course if you want to add an element of luxury to your look then velvet is a surefire way to do it. This mini looks great with bare legs and high heel sandals but worked just as well with opaque black tights on Kim. But we do have to say we love the addition of the belt by Ms Jenner. It really accentuates her tiny waist.

Asos, Boohoo and Missguided have all got velvet dresses that will give you Kendall's look for less. So then the only question is, who wore it best?

Speaking to Elle.com, Kendall revealed that her top trick is to distribute the pressure of the heels by alternating her weight on each foot. 

'I switch off from one foot to another a lot, like this. [She crosses one foot behind the other in her now-signature pose.]' 

Kendall went on to explain: 'You have to keep moving your feet!'

Although this seems rather counter-intuitive, the point is to never keep the pressure on the ball of one foot for too long, but rather to regularly shift the weight to alleviate the pain. 

The model sported lower heels for the recent Chanel Autumn/Winter 2015 show, but her top tip works for all heel heights

In the interview, Kendall also went on to reveal a physical attribute that makes heel-wearing even more painful. 

'I have the longest toes in the world; they're spider toes. They are. I have spider fingers, too! So they're kind of being crunched right now...' 

The solution? Wearing expensive heels, the model insists that it's down to quality.

'Shoes [that] are good. They're Manolo Blahniks. And they're high.'
