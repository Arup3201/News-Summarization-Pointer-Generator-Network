Five simultaneous drug busts in New Jersey have yielded the usual assortment of marijuana, ecstasy and guns, along with more exotic contraband: a baby crocodile.

The Mercer County prosecutor's office says authorities executing search warrants Thursday in Trenton and Bordentown found the reptile living in the basement of a house.

Animal control officers were called to the scene on Poplar Street in Trenton and removed the baby crocodile.

Along with the scaly critter, authorities found marijuana. Two men, identified as Alexander Green, 35, and  Dawud Joyner, 34, were arrested on a slew of drug charges.

The search warrants of the five homes yielded more than 100 grams of ecstasy, two guns and more than $2,000 in cash. A car also was seized.

Authorities say Green was the target of the three-month investigation by the prosecutor's office's narcotics task force, which culminated in Thursday's raids. 

According to prosecutors, just before 4pm Thursday officers executed search warrants at five addresses on Poplar Street in Trenton and Ward Avenue in Bordentown.

In all, the drug bust yielded a .380 caliber semi-automatic handgun, a defaced .38 Special revolver and a black ski mask stashed inside an oven, as well as bags of marijuana, ecstasy and drug paraphernalia, including a digital scale and baggies

The baby crocodile was discovered inside the basement of 43 Poplar Street where Dawdud Joyner lived with Richelle Ayers. Both were arrested on drug charges and outstanding warrants.

A 2004 Pontiac Grand Prix was also seized by officials as drug proceeds.

Lt. Mike Novembre, the commanding officer of the operation, said the estimated street value of the seized ecstasy was $3,180, while the value of the marijuana was $750.

Alexander Green has been charged with multiple drug and weapons possession counts. He is being held on $150,000 bail.
