An autopsy has revealed that a married father was drunk when he shot his wife and children and set the family's house on fire before killing himself.

Darrin Campbell had a blood-alcohol level of 0.11 at the time of his death in a $1.6 million rented Tampa home belonging to retired tennis player James Blake.

Campbell, 49, shot his 51-year-old wife Kimberly and children - 18-year-old Collin and 16-year-old Megan - on May 7, Hillsborough County Sheriff's deputies said.

An autopsy report revealed today that Darrin Campbell, left, was drunk when he shot wife, Kimberly, right, in the head with his .40-caliber handgun in Florida. He killed his two children in the same way

Colin Campbell, 18 (left), was a well-known member of the varsity baseball team and attended the exclusive and private Carrollwood Day School with his sister, Megan, 15 (right)

Autopsy reports revealed that his wife 
and children were each shot once in the head. There was no soot in their
 airways, indicating they died before Campbell set fire to the home.

Authorities said Campbell bought a .40-caliber handgun and $600 in fireworks in the weeks before the shootings, according to The Tampa Tribune.

Campbell,
 49, who had no criminal record or history of mental illness and was 
described as being part of what looked to be 'the perfect suburban 
family', spent days preparing for the murder-suicide on Wednesday, 
buying fireworks and cans of gasoline that would destroy his rented 
Florida mansion.

Retired tennis star James Blake said last month he didn't know the family who died in the Florida home they were renting from him.

Fire: The blaze was so ferocious on May 7 that firefighters could not get in to examine the grisly scene until the next day

Blake said his only contact with Darrin 
Campbell was 'a few emails for the lease agreement'. He said he never 
met any of the family face-to-face.

He told reporters at a tennis event that his thoughts and prayers were with the family, and he hoped police would keep him updated on their investigation.

According to reports in The Tampa Bay Times, Campbell - who was leasing the five-bedroom home in Avila, known for its luxurious mansions and heavy security - had recently displayed some odd behavior, in terms of his finances and his career.

In February 2006, Darrin and Kimberly Campbell bought a vacant lot in Odessa for $294,000.

In March 
2011, the local property owners' association placed a lien on the lot 
for unpaid association fees totaling $8,000, which were apparently paid 
by February 2012.

Retired tennis star James Blake has said that he didn't know the family who died last week in the Florida home they were renting from him

In
 both 2008 and 2012, Darrin Campbell was delinquent in paying his 
property taxes on the lot, though the taxes, totaling about $7,800, were
 eventually paid.

Taxes on the property for 2013 have not been paid.

'We
 are conducting a financial audit on him to determine if there were some
 financial issues,'Hillsborough County sheriff's Col. Donna Lusczynski 
said.

'We do know that he was working up to a point but recently had taken some time off."

Campbell took last week off from his job at VASTEC, the digital records company.

Last Monday, a VASTEC spokesman said, he requested a leave of absence 'for unspecified reasons', which the company approved.

The
 gun Campbell used in the murders and suicide was a .40-caliber Sig 
Sauer, a popular handgun he bought in July 2013 at Shooters World, a 
store and gun range on Fletcher Avenue.

Bruce
 Kitzis, the store's general manager, said Campbell's only visit there 
was to buy the gun, and that he passed a federally mandated background 
check before purchasing the weapon.

'It was (about) a year ago, was the only time he came in. We did the background check and everything was fine,' Kitzis said.

Sinister:
 Fireworks were found strewn around the house and police say an 
accelerant - probably the gas canisters he bought - were used to start 
the blaze last month

It's unfortunate. We at Shooters World did everything we could, of course. There are so many wonderful gun owners. It's a tragedy.'

Campbell also bought a large number of fireworks and gas cans, which was caught on CCTV. He then made two purchases of gasoline from different stores.

Family members said the Campbells had a 'strong marriage'.

The firecrackers seen in Campbell's shopping cart in the video were reportedly used to start a fire in his home on May 7 after he allegedly shot dead his family

Campbell's mother Mary said they had 'everything to live for' and were a perfect family.

The investigation is to focus on Campbell's financial situation.

Local realtors estimated Campbell would have been paying $6,000 a month to rent out the 5,000 sq ft home from former tennis star James Blake.

The family moved into the rented home so that the children could be near to their private school after selling their previous $750,000 home for a profit.

He also had school fees for son Colin,19, and daughter Megan,16, of more than $35,000 a year.

Meanwhile, a surveillance video was released showing Darrin Campbell dressed in a dark-grey T-shirt and shorts placing stacks of fireworks into a shopping cart at Phantom Fireworks.
