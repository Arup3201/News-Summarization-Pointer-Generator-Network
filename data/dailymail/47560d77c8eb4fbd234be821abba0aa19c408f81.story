Designer Sassi Holford makes wedding dresses that are the stuff of fairy tales – she created Autumn Kelly’s gown for her marriage to Princess Anne’s son Peter Phillips. And her beautiful daughter Missie has the enviable job of modelling some of her fabulous work.

Yet while Missie may look perfect dressed in princess-pink tulle and satin, life is far from easy for the 12-year-old.

She suffers from a rare, incurable lung condition that has seen her hospitalised 32 times – 12 of which required intensive care.

Incurable: Sassi Holford's daughter Missie, 12, has been hospitalised 32 times as a result of her lung condition which makes her vulnerable to infection

Missie has bronchiectasis, which causes the airways to become abnormally widened, leading to a build-up of excess mucus.

This can make the lungs more vulnerable to infection and even a common cold could become life-threatening.

Her first emergency is etched in her mother’s mind. ‘It was a warm day in July 2002, just after Missie’s second birthday, and we’d been picnicking in the countryside,’ says Sassi, who lives in Somerset with husband Martin, her business manager, and children Charles, 16, Missie and her twin brother Hugo, 12.

‘She was a normal, bouncy toddler, but within an hour of getting home she went limp, her lips turned blue and she was gasping to breathe. Martin and I drove her to Musgrove Hospital in Taunton.’

Missie was treated with intravenous antibiotics, oxygen and inhalers for what was believed to be a one-off virus.

Four days later she was discharged. But the family’s relief was short-lived. Three weeks later the same thing happened, and a further 15 hospital admissions followed in the next two years.

Sassi, Martin and anyone who ever looked after Missie at home or school became adept at recognising the signs that she was going to be ill.

‘I was responsible for the livelihoods of 40 staff so I couldn’t just walk away from my business to be at home full-time, and we wanted Missie’s life to feel as normal as possible between episodes,’ says Sassi, whose other children do not suffer from the condition. ‘We made sure anyone who looked after her was fully briefed on her condition.

SassI adds: ‘Before an episode, there would be a change in her demeanour. When she was well she had a good appetite and was energetic and always laughing.

Before an attack, she’d become withdrawn and we’d spot tugging in her neck where her airways were straining, plus the familiar blue tinge to her lips.

It was easier when she was four and she could say ‘‘doctor’’ if she felt poorly and ‘‘hospital’’ if she thought something serious was about to happen.’

Bronchiectasis can affect anyone at any age. An estimated one in 1,000 adults and one in 10,000 children in the UK have the condition.

About 9,000 are admitted to hospital every year, and in 2010 there were 1,000 deaths with bronchiectasis an underlying factor.

The lungs are full of tiny branching 
airways, known as the bronchi, whose role is to move oxygen into even 
smaller sacs called alveoli that transfer oxygen into the blood.

Professor Stephen Spiro, of the British Lung Foundation, says: ‘Bronchiectasis means that the airways dilate in the lung due to an infection which then causes the production of a lot of phlegm. This can trigger a vicious circle of mucus gathering in the bronchi, making them prone to infection and further widening them, leading to a build-up of more mucus.

‘It’s common in those with cystic fibrosis, but can also be caused by a previous childhood lung infection, or if a problem with the immune system has led to the bronchi becoming damaged due to infection.’

Any cold or virus could put Missie into a critical state. ‘Even going shopping, we risked her picking up a cold and very quickly her lungs would get infected and close down,’ says Sassi.

The turning-point for Missie’s health was in 2007 when immunology specialists at Great Ormond Street Hospital realised the weak link was in her immune system and that she has no resistance to pneumonia.

‘We were then able to prevent future attacks with the swift use of antibiotics when symptoms presented, regular pneumonia vaccinations, a steroid inhaler and daily physiotherapy sessions,’ says Sassi.

Prof Spiro says physio is a key treatment for bronchiectasis and that although living with the condition can be distressing, the outlook for most sufferers is good. ‘It doesn’t disappear, but in most cases it’s possible to manage through medication and physiotherapy to strengthen and clear the lungs,’ he says.

Missie’s condition began to stabilise in 2008 and she now loves to play netball, horse-ride and dance.

‘She hasn’t been hospitalised for four years,’ says Sassi. ‘She still uses an inhaler daily and holidays are planned with military precision to ensure medical care is nearby. But finally, I feel I can start to relax.’
