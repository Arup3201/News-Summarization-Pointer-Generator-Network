A paramedic team rushed to the Chelsea dressing room just moments after Thibaut Courtois was substituted after just 23 minutes at Stamford Bridge, before the player was taken to hospital.

Courtois suffered concussion in the collision with Alexis Sanchez after just 10 minutes and was replaced by Petr Cech following the incident that eventually forced off the Belgian keeper.

Courtois played on for 13 minutes despite the concussion, before it became clear that he needed to be replace.
