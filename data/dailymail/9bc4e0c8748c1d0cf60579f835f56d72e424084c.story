David Cameron ruled out doing a deal with Ukip as he came under fresh pressure from Tory MPs to stem losses at the general election.

Tory MPs fear that without an electoral pact with Nigel Farage - which would see Ukip agree not to stand against Eurosceptic Conservatives - Labour could take power next year.

But the Prime Minister insisted: 'We're the Conservative party, we don't do pacts or deals, we're fighting all out.' 

David Cameron, touring a warehouse today, insisted he understood the message from voters who chose to back Ukip

Labour ousted the Tories from Hammersmith and Fulham, a flagship authority in the capital, and also gained the key target London borough of Croydon from the Conservatives. 

Downing Street took comfort from seeing off the Labour threat in Swindon and Thurrock, but Ukip gains robbed them of overall control in Maidstone, Peterborough, Basildon, Castle Point and Southend. 

However Ukip gains  cost the Tories control in Maidstone, Basildon, Peterborough, Castle Point and Southend-on-Sea. 

Conservative MP 
Douglas Carswell said: ‘We need a pact with Ukip. If David Cameron is
 as serious about an in/out vote in 2017 as he says he is, and if Nigel 
Farage is as serious about Brexit as he claims, the two of them need to 
do a deal,’ he said. 

Jacob Rees-Mogg told the BBC: 'In a first-past-the-post system, if they don't get those votes into one pot, then both those sides end up losing.' 

WINS: Increasing majority in Swindon, a major Labour target.

Clung on in Tamworth after losing just one seat to Ukip. Won Kingston upon Thames from the Lib Dems.

LOSSES: Labour taking Hammersmith and Fulham is a big blow.

Maidstone and Peterborough slipped into no overall control after Ukip gains. Brentwood, in Eric Pickles' backyard, now no overall control, alongside other south Essex councils Basildon, Castle Point and Southend.

But speaking in his Oxfordshire constituency, Mr Cameron insisted he would not do a deal.

'We're the Conservative party, we don't do pacts or deals, we're fighting all out for an all out win at the next election,' he said.

But he conceded that the public were 'frustrated' with the political establishment's failure to address their concerns.

'People want us to deliver,' he said. 'The economy is growing, we are creating jobs, but we have got to work harder and we have got to really deliver on issues that are frustrating people and frustrating me, like welfare reform and immigration and making sure people really benefit from this recovery.

'We will be working flat out to demonstrate that we do have the answers to help hard working people.'

Tory backbencher John Baron - MP for Basildon and Billericay - said Mr Cameron was still making mistakes and ceding ground to Ukip.

'Whilst accepting that Ukip is in part a protest vote, the political establishment has been too complacent over the EU. It must now heed the message from these elections,' he said.

'No 10 must learn from past mistakes. First it tried to ignore, and then insult, Ukip. It then took our backbench campaigns to get a referendum, and then support for legislation.

'But even now mistakes are being made. We have immigration targets, yet cannot control the major EU component. 

'We also need to make clearer that there will be no deal with Ukip.'

Tory party chairman Grant Shapps insisted: 'We’re not going to have a pact or joint candidates, or whatever.

'No 10 must learn from past mistakes. We have immigration targets, yet cannot control the major EU component'

'It can’t happen on a technical basis because we do not allow joint candidates to stand... It’s not going to happen because we’re the Conservative party; we are the best chance to offer an in/out referendum, the only chance.'

Education Secretary Michael Gove told ITV's Good Morning Britain: 'I don’t think we should have a pact. 

'I think we should seek to get every individual who is concerned about the best future for this country to support David Cameron as the next Prime Minister and the best way to do that is to vote Conservative.

'We appreciate and understand why people have voted Ukip, and in government we will make sure that we deliver on the priorities that people have clearly set out.

'There’s a clear instruction from people on us to deliver. I understand why some people have been angry in the past about the failure of government, but now that we’re in a position to deliver, we should.' 

Tory Education Secretary Michael Gove said the loss of votes to Ukip was a 'clear instruction from people on us to deliver'

Defeat
 by Ukip had been expected to renew pressure on Mr Cameron to toughen up
 on Europe and immigration. But a planned Tory backlash has been put on 
hold while the party focuses on fighting next month’s Newark 
by-election, vacated by shamed Tory MP Patrick Mercer.

A
 Tory MP said: ‘People are keeping their powder dry until we see the 
result in Newark. To lose would be a disaster – there would be massive 
ructions.’
