The luxury property tycoon behind Britain’s most expensive development is about to move into London’s largest private residence, second only to Buckingham Palace.

Christian Candy is listed on Land Registry documents as the purchaser of a row of seven grade I listed buildings that have planning permission to be transformed into a mansion in Regent’s Park.

After years of selling multi-million pound flats and homes to some of the wealthiest people in the world, the purchase will set the 39-year-old businessman back almost £100million.

The seven Regency houses on Chester Gate and Cambridge Terrace (shown) in Regent's Park, north London, will set Christian Candy back around £100million

Marcus Cooper Group put up the 50,000 sq ft Regency terrace up for sale in June after winning permission to convert the row of seven office buildings into a vast 15-bedroom stuccoed mansion.

It will have 35 bathrooms alone and could  be worth £200m once converted. 

On the top floor of the seven-storey house there will be a lush private roof garden, completely invisible from street level.

It will feature a giant sliding glass roof to allow sunbathing in hot weather, and keep out the rain during the rest of the year.

The resulting home - which includes numbers six to 10 Cambridge Terrace (pictured) will be more akin to a palace, and indeed will claim the title of London's largest residence after Buckingham Palace

The seven Regency houses, including numbers one and two Chester Gate and numbers six to 10 Cambridge Terrace were designed by John Nash - the architect of Buckingham Palace.

They were constructed in 1826 but were damaged by bombs in WWII and a subsequent fire in 1947, before being restored with replica Nash facades in the 1980s.

The sale represents one of the most expensive in the world, joining a small collection of trophy homes that have commanded nine figure price tags, including a handful in London. 

Knight Frank is believed to be advising Marcus Cooper Group. All parties declined to comment.

Mr Candy and his brother Nick are behind luxury housing scheme, One Hyde Park, in Knightsbridge.

They worked with the prime minister of Qatar to deliver the major retail and residential complex, estimated to have cost £1.15billion.

The central London development is home to  Britain's most expensive ever flat after a wealthy Eastern European reportedly bought it for £140million.
