Police in Albuquerque are facing intense criticism after video footage was released which appears to show officers using excessive force to apprehend a homeless man who was holding two knifes.

James Boyd, 38, died as a result of his injuries after a standoff with cops last Sunday, during which police fired two stun gun rounds, six rounds of gunfire, a bean bag and a K-9 unit was released on him.

The entire ordeal was caught on one officer’s lapel camera and has led to a public outcry from city and state leaders who have accused the police of using excessive force.

Police in Albuquerque are facing intense criticism after video footage was released which appears to show officers using excessive force to apprehend James Boyd, a homeless man who was holding two knives

Speaking to reporters during a press conference on Friday, Albuquerque Police Chief Gorden Eden said he thought his officers' actions were justified.

The lapel footage shows half a dozen officers standing about 20 feet away from the man while shouting ‘get on the ground!’ and 'drop the knife!'

Boyd was actually turning away as officers unloaded beanbags, stun guns and live rounds on him.

Boyd, who police say had a lengthy criminal record, later died. However, Eden said the medical examiner has not yet determined if the bullets killed Boyd.

The shooting comes as Albuquerque police is under a U.S. Justice Department investigation over excessive force and three dozen police shootings since 2010.

‘We need to look at some changes within the department, but I think more importantly we need to restore confidence in the Albuquerque police department,’ said City Council President Ken Sanchez.

State Senator Michael Padilla said he was responding to worried constituents.

He says he was disturbed not only by the video, but by APD Police Chief Gorden Eden’s comments that the shooting was justified.

‘I'm very concerned about the chief of police immediately jumping to conclusions,’ Padilla said.

‘I think we all know with camera on the lapel video - something definitely happened.’

Sanchez said was concerned about how the public now sees the APD.

‘We need to work hard to restore confidence in the men and women who work for the Albuquerque Police Department,’ he told KOB4.

At Friday’s press conference Eden said police responding to a suspicious-person call found Boyd sleeping at what looked like an illegal makeshift camp in the Sandia foothills.

Eden said Boyd later claimed to be a federal agent and demanded to see officers with New Mexico State Police, who he also threatened to kill.

‘The officers were attempting to affect a felony arrest using less-than lethal weapons, including a distractive device, K9, and a Taser shotgun,’ Eden said.

Authorities said Boyd threatened to kill a Crisis Intervention Team officer called to the scene.

When Boyd refused to follow police orders and an unarmed K9 officer got close to him, officers Keith Sandy and Dominique Perez shot toward Boyd, Eden said.

The video footage shows an injured Boyd with two five-inch knives in his hand when officers surround and handcuff him.

‘The suspect did in fact make a decision not to follow the directions that (were) provided to him by the officers,’ Eden said.

‘On many occasions he said that he was not going to come off that mountain.’

Eden said many of Boyd's prior arrests were for violent crimes, including a December 2010 arrest on charges he punched a female officer and fractured her nose at a city library.
