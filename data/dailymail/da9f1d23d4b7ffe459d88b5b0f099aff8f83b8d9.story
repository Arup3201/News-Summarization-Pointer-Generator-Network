An African-American chef who is out of a job after the University of Oklahoma shut down a fraternity for performing a racist chant has said he will never find such a good job again.

Howard Dixon, who has served students his famous chili dogs and burgers at Sigma Alpha Epsilon for 15 years, is now unemployed after the university closed the fraternity with immediate effect.

It comes after members were filmed chanting 'There will never be a n***** in SAE' to the tune of 'If You're Happy And You Know It'.

'I think that was kind of stupid and selfish for them to do something like that,' Howard told CBS. 'And knowing this was an organization supposed to be about brotherhood - that wasn't no brotherhood.'

But Howard added that he will miss his job and the fraternity's members.

'There'll never be another job like this one again,' he said. 'This was one of a kind. I'll miss my family.'

On Tuesday, photos emerged showing Mr Dixon moving his belongings out of the house. 

After it emerged that the beloved chef would be losing his job, Oklahoma University alumni launched online fundraisers, which have already raised more than $45,000 for the man and his family.

One former SAE member created an Indiegogo fundraiser, writing: 'He is going to lose his job because of a bus full of racist kids... Because of these kids' actions, many will be affected. None more so than Howard.'

Howard, he writes, 'was always there to chat with you' but now 'he is going to learn who has been working for. And through some cruel twist of fate, he has to lose the job that he has held for over a decade.' 

Support: Howard has worked as a chef at Oklahoma University's Sigma Alpha Epsilon for more than 15 years and alumni remembered his famous chili dogs and how he had an 'infectious' smile

'There will never be a n***** SAE': The vile chant was performed by members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity chapter at the University of Oklahoma on Saturday. The society has since been shut down

By early on Tuesday, the fund had amassed more than $33,000 - and it is not the only one.  

Simultaneously another former SAE brother set up a GoFundMe page slamming 'the disgusting chant' and lauding Howard as 'hard-working and loyal'.

That page has raised more than $11,000.

A Twitter user who shared a link to the fundraising page wrote: 'I went to an OU SAE tailgate one time, (had a great time) an i met that man howard, he grills a mean burger.'

All members of the fraternity had until midnight on Monday to leave the premises, University of Oklahoma President David Boren announced at a press conference amid a chorus of furious reaction to the footage.

On Tuesday, Boren expelled two students after he said they were identified as leaders of the chant.
