Sam Allardyce insists Diafra Sakho will only get a new contract when he and the chairmen decide.

Sakho is keen for an improved deal after his blistering start to life at West Ham, despite only signing a four-year contract in the summer.

Sakho posted a picture of himself at co-chairman David Sullivan's house during the week as they were discussing the possibility of a better contract.

Sam Allardyce says Sakho will only be offered a new contract if the chairman and him see fit to do so

Allardyce said: 'He doesn't have to have a new contract because he has a four-year contract anyway.

'If he is going to get one, it will be out of the fact that the chairman and ourselves think that we are going to re-adjust the contract he has now.

'I am sure that will be discussed if and when the chairman is ready and whenever the outcome is, he will tell everybody.' 

The West Ham manager appeared frustrated that his star striker this season would pick the busy festive period to start talking about new terms.

West Ham face Leicester on Saturday then Chelsea and Arsenal in quick-succession as they look to maintain their fourth place in the Premier League.

'I would think that the chairman would probably discuss that situation when Christmas is finished,' Allardyce added.

'I don't see why we should be discussing any contracts with anyone really too much in this period when we are playing so many games in such a short period of time.

'But yet again players don't see it that way do they? 

'If they think it is time for them they don't give a monkeys about anyone else. They just get on with their own thing. 

'They won't worry about the fact that we have got so many games and we have got to organise this and that.'
