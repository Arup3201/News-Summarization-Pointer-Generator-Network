The Texas city may not be particularly well-known outside the southern U.S. state, but it now has a claim to fame after being revealed as the safety city in America.

The city of 278,000 just outside Dallas is home to a junk food HQ and a retail giant, but also boasts the lowest crime rate of U.S. cities in a recent study.

Plano also has the sixth-lowest traffic fatality rate, which helped it top a Forbes study of America's safest cities for the second year in a row.

The Las Vegas suburb of Henderson, Nevada, and Honolulu in Hawaii come in second and third, respectively.

A sound economic footing is one of the factors which makes cities safe, according to experts.

Scott B. Clark, president of the New York-based Risk and Insurance Management Society, said: 'One of the underlying things, in terms of a city’s safety, would be a very strong tax base, as there are a number of services that are reliant on it.

'That includes an effective, well-staffed police department, fire department and school system.

The median household income in Plano is $79,234, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, nearly 60 percent above the national average, and 8.1 percent of residents are below the poverty line, compared to a national rate of 15.1 percent. The city is also home to a number of Fortune 500 companies.

John Worrall, head of the criminology program at the University of Texas at Dallas, said: 'Plano is a very clean, affluent suburb with no inner city per se.

'Plus it has one of the few police departments in the U.S. that require four-year degrees. I don’t know that there is research to back up its making things safer, but it makes Plano unique.'

Henderson, Nevada, toko second spot despite its location within the Metropolitan Statistical Area of Las Vegas-Paradise, which ranked ninth this year on Forbes’ list of America’s Most Dangerous Cities.

That may be because Henderson has a relatively high median income of $61,861, a low poverty rate (seven per cent) and higher median home prices than Las Vegas, points out Tamara Madensen, a criminology professor at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas.

She adds: 'Casinos in Henderson cater mainly to local residents, which reduces traffic and the number of tourists moving about in the city.'

Henderson, Nevada, took second place in the study

Honolulu, Hawaii, took third place in the Forbes study to find America's safest city

In third place on our list is Honolulu, which ranks fourth lowest for violent crime and seventh lowest for traffic fatalities. The city is relatively well off, with a median household income of $54,828, above the national average of $50,046, and a below average poverty rate of 10.5 percent.

Hawaii has some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation, and that famous relaxed aloha spirit may play a role in keeping accident and violence rates low.

Dave Kahaulelio, president of the Honolulu chapter of the Risk and Insurance Management Society, said: 'Honolulu is kind of like a big small town where everyone seems connected.'
