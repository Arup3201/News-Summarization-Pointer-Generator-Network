A London woman is embroiled in a fight for compensation with Jet Airways after toilets and sinks overflowed and smelly water seeped into the cabin during an eight-hour flight.

Passengers, including two families with infant children, were forced to endure the pungent smell for about six hours as they travelled from Delhi to London.

Traveller Amrita Jaurre snapped photos as water flowed into the aisles and rows, and cabin crew scrambled to contain the mess by piling newspapers on the floor.

The 27-year-old office worker told MailOnline Travel: ‘After two hours, myself and other passengers noticed water seeping out from under the two lavatories closest to our seats.

‘We complained to the air steward who took no notice at first but once the overflow become more obvious, he realised we were not over exaggerating.

‘He then told us that the water was overflowing from the toilet and sink in both lavatories, so you can imagine the smell that we then had to endure for the remainder of the flight.’

She added: ‘It was quite difficult to tell whether the liquid contained human waste, but it would not surprise me as … the liquid overflowing from the lavatories definitely had a foul urine-like smell.’

Passengers were forced to cover their mouths and noses with scarves or clothing to escape the stench. However, the airline claims the water was simply leaking from sinks.

In an attempt to cover the smell a flight attendant sprayed the wet patches with an air freshener.

Amrita said: ‘This then led to complaints from a nearby passenger who suffered from asthma and couldn't be near such a strong fragrance without risking an asthma attack.

‘After this, the flight attendant went back to check on the lavatories and almost gagged when he opened the door so I can only imagine the state of the toilets.’

Amrita said the situation became worse over the course of the flight last month as the toilet and sink in the lavatory on the opposite side of the plane began to overflow as well.

She said she lodged a complaint on Twitter after returning to London, and the Mumbai-based airline offered an apology.

She complained again and was offered a 2,000-point credit for Jet Airways’ frequent flyer club.

She wasn’t satisfied with the offer, saying: ‘Personally, I have no intention to ever fly with Jet Airways again after that experience.

A spokesperson for Jet Airways told MailOnline Travel: 'Jet Airways regrets any inconvenience caused to guests on board flight 9W122 DEL - LHR dt.,Feb 15, 2015, on account of reverse drainage from the sinks on board the aircraft. 

'As per our investigation, the overflow was only of water from the sink. All human waste is carried by separate system and lines which functioned normally during the flight.'

Jet Airways investigated the incident and maintains the liquid leaking was coming from the sinks

Ms Jaurre said: ‘Ideally, I would like compensation from Jet Airways because I feel that their offer of frequent flyer miles isn't sufficient, given that I was already quite ill on the flight and it didn't help then having to sit in that unhygienic and filthy cabin.

‘I'm unsure if any other passengers became ill but as the liquid continued to overflow and the smell became more evident, it gave me a very bad headache and made me nauseous which put me off my in-flight meal.’

She added: ‘I became quite ill after the flight with a combination of throat infection, ear infection and stomach pains and had to take a week off from work to get better. Whether these were a direct result of the situation on-board, I cannot say but it definitely didn't help.’

She is seeking monetary compensation plus a refund to cover the cost of the ticket.

‘Nobody should ever have to sit through such disgusting in-flight conditions and the right checks should have been made to the aircraft to ensure things like this shouldn't have happened.’
