The Duchess of York has arrived in Balmoral to spend a long weekend with the Queen but will have to leave before Prince Philip joins her, it has been revealed.

Sarah Ferguson arrived at the Scottish estate for a summer break with former husband Prince Andrew and their daughters Beatrice and Eugenie on Thursday.

They will enjoy some time with the Queen, who is believed to be fond of her former daughter-in-law, but has to leave before Prince Philip arrives on Tuesday because 'he won't have her in the house', a source told the Sun.

Still close: Sarah Ferguson and Prince Andrew arriving in Scotland on Thursday ahead of their break at Balmoral. It is thought that she will stay until Monday, the day before Prince Philip arrives

It is 
thought that Prince Philip is confused by his son's relationship with 
his former wife, who still lives at the Duke of York's home in Windsor, 
and that he refuses to see her.

A Balmoral source told the Sun:
 'Prince Philip won't have her in the house. He cannot understand why 
she's living under the same roof as Andrew after all these years.

'Normally members of the royal family stay a week or two, but the Duchess has to cut short her stay.'

Balmoral Castle is used regularly by the Royal Family for their summer break and the Queen is due to stay for two months.

While
 The Duchess of York has visited Balmoral since her divorce, last summer
 was thought to be the first time she had been invited to stay in the 
main castle on the Queen's estate since her marriage ended in 1996.

The couple, who still live together, separated in 1992 but remained on good terms and brought up their daughters together.

They have made no secret of their amicability since their split and describe themselves as 'the world's happiest unmarried couple'.

In the 
years since their split, which was just six years after their lavish 
royal wedding at Westminster Abbey, the couple have often been seen 
enjoying nights out together - and reunite with their daughters for 
annual summer holidays.

The
 source added: 'Many people have speculated they will remarry, which 
could be more likely if Prince Philip drops his opposition.'

It
 has been previously claimed that Prince Philip has never forgiven the 
Duchess for the embarrassment she caused the Royal Family during the 
1990s - during which time she embarked on an affair with a Texan oil 
tycoon while pregnant with her second child and was photographed ­having
 her toes sucked by her 'financial adviser'.

In 2010 she also was revealed to have tried to sell access to Andrew for £500,000 to an undercover reporter as she tried desperately to pay off debts of £3million.

It has been reported that Prince Andrew, then a Special Trade Ambassador, helped her out of financial difficulty.

In 2000 the Duchess of York said during an interview that she and her former husband had talked of remarrying but that Prince Philip would not allow it.

The Queen is said to think of her as a 'good mother'.
