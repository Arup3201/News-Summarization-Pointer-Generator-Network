The price of sending some parcels is to be cut in the run up to Christmas, saving consumers up to £5.20 per package, the Royal Mail has announced.

The size of a 'small' parcel will effectively double to 2kg, at a cost of £2.80. A package this large would have previously been classed as 'medium' size and would have cost customers £8.

The promotion will last from October 20 to January 18, allowing families and businesses to make savings by sending larger items at a reduced rate, and cramming more into a single package than they would have been able to previously.

Delivery: Royal Mail is to cut the price of sending small parcels in the run up to Christmas, saving consumers up to £5.20 per package.  The temporary promotion will last from October 20 to January 18

The increased size of a 'small parcel' - currently 45cm x 35cm x 16cm - is permanent and will remain in place after the January 18 deadline, but the maximum weight limit will return to one kilo or under.

There are currently separate prices for parcels weighing more or less than one kilo, even if their packaging is the same size. 

Speaking of the promotion, Nick Landon, Managing Director of Royal Mail Parcels, said: 'We are pleased to further simplify our stamped parcels portfolio to provide great value and support consumers and small businesses.

'To launch the new small parcel format we are introducing a festive price promotion that will benefit customers sending Christmas presents to friends and relatives, marketplace sellers and smaller businesses selling gifts online,' he added.

The promotion takes effect on October 20, just in time for the Christmas post when up to 10 million parcels are delivered to UK addresses every day.

Royal Mail said the scheme will also see approximately 100 Royal Mail delivery offices opening on Sundays over the Christmas period in order to guarantee more parcels arrive in a timely fashion.

Although the extended opening hours are only a trial, Royal Mail said the plan is intended to make picking up a parcel easier for customers who work all week and struggle to pick up packages on a week day. 

Royal Mail has also already started delivering to addresses in and around London on Sundays.
