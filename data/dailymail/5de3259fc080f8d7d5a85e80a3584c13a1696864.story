Lawyers in Germany are preparing a groundbreaking court case aimed at stripping diplomats of immunity from prosecution.

Human rights lawyers hope the case against a Saudi Arabian diplomat accused of beating an employee will be the catalyst to be able to bring prosecutions against foreign embassy staff worldwide.

The German Institute for Human Rights this week published a 60-page study on the reported widespread humiliation, exploitation and abuse of private domestic servants employed by diplomats in Britain, Austria, Belgium, France, Switzerland and Germany.

Widespread: The British Embassy in Berlin. A German study has revealed widespread humiliation, exploitation and abuse of private staff by diplomats in six European countries

The UK had 51 cases of abuse reported between April 2009 and March 2010. Many of those involved people who had come to the UK through people traffickers.

Some 70 per cent of those employed by diplomats said in a survey, conducted by the Kalayaan Justice for Migrant Workers Group in Britain, that their passports were confiscated and they were paid and treated like 'slaves'.

Belgium had 50 cases in 2009 - although only four were referred to authorities - while Switzerland was worst in the list with 62.

The report mirrors another published in the U.S. yesterday, which put Britain on the 'top tier' of abuse of diplomatic employees.

The landmark court case in Germany concerns a 30-year-old woman who claims she endured daily beatings with a stick for 18 months at the hands of a diplomat from the Saudi Arabian embassy in Berlin.

She said she was kicked and 'humiliated like a serf'.

'Top tier of abuse': The Iranian and Ethiopian embassies in London. Britain had 51 reported incidents of abuse between April 2009 and March 2010. There is no indication the incidents took place at these embassies

Unable to speak German and with no money, the Indonesian native was a prisoner of her employer.

Eventually, a Berlin group that aids trafficked women from all over the world took her to safety.

Diplomatic immunity is laid down in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 and makes embassy employees unanswerable to the laws governing the rest of society.

The worst thing that can happen is expulsion back to their homeland.

Hamburg lawyer Klaus Bertlsmann and the German Institute for Human Rights are now financing the court case which could give the right to legal redress against diplomats who exploit their staff.

He said: 'Human rights are, also from the perspective of international law, a higher good than diplomatic immunity.'

The woman was sent by an agency in Jakarta to work at a home in the UAE before transferring her to Saudi Arabia.

In April 2009, she accompanied her Saudi employer to Germany were he was to serve as an attache at the embassy, according to the German news magazine Der Spiegel.

Her duties included caring for the wheelchair-bound wife of the diplomat and his four daughters - including putting on their shoes each day, even though the eldest was 17 and the youngest 12.

She worked from 7am until gone midnight every day, slept on the floor and never had a single day off in the entire time she worked for the family.

She told of being punched, of the stick beatings and of how her employer encouraged his five-year-old son to hit her.

An earlier court hearing rejected claims of slavery because of the diplomatic status of the alleged abuser. The next step is a hearing at the state court, followed by the constitutional court.

Der Spiegel said: 'The fact that a case of modern slavery was brought before a court is already extraordinary in its own right.

'No one checks to see if members of the diplomatic corps obey the regulations regarding working hours and wages that have been in force for the past eight years. It would, after all, violate the principle of immunity.'

The legal firm representing the Saudi Arabian embassy dismissed the allegations made by the woman, who has since returned to Indonesia, as 'baseless'.Â
