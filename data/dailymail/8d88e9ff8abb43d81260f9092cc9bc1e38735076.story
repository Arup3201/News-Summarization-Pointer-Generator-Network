A person of interest has been named in the 1969 deaths of a mother and her five children who were all killed during a horrific house fire.

Investigators initially believed the fire, which ravaged Nancy and David Landers’ Wilmington, Massachusetts home, was caused by a defective power outlet behind the family’s living room sofa.

However, authorities now have said that an ex-con who has recently started visiting the family grace site on the anniversary of their deaths could have something to do with the inferno that claimed the lives of Nancy Launder and five of her children, aged seven to 13.

Tragedy: A September 1969 house fire killed Nancy Landers and five of her children; now, police have named an ex-con as a person of interest in their deaths

Scorched: The family's home in Wilmington, Massachusetts was badly burned and left five children and their mother dead

Susan Landers, one of two of the children who survived the blaze, told FoxNews.com that she ran into the unnamed person of interest last Memorial Day at the family’s grave site.

Susan, who is now married and goes by Susan McNamara, said that the 62-year-old ex-con approached her last year. ‘He said a whole series of things to me, including that he was a Christian man now,’ she told the website.

‘He claimed he spoke to my father before he passed away and that my father gave him forgiveness.’Mrs McNamara said that in 1969, Wilmington police had questioned her about the person of interest, but no charges were filed against him.

According to the Wilmington Patch, the decades-old police records were either lost or destroyed.

Police told FoxNews.com that the ex-convict has a string of criminal convictions, including a 1994 armed assault and an attempted robbery charge in the 1980s.

On the quiet streets of Wilmington, about 10 miles north of Boston, the Landers family slept quietly in their home. It was September 26, 1969.

In the middle of the night, the family awoke to find their house ablaze. Nancy, 37, was killed, as well as her children K.C., 4, Lisa, 7, Kevin, 9, Billy, 12, and Davey, 13.

Nancy’s husband David and three of their children, Harry, Susan, and Michael, managed to survive. According to the Wilmington Town Crier, David crawled his way into the smoke, finding Susan.

By breaking a window and placing her on the roof of the burning house, he managed to save her life.However, Nancy died in the couple’s bedroom, along with Lisa and K.C.

The boys, who were in a second-story bedroom, also perished.

The family’s cousin Joseph Casey, who was visiting at the time of the fire, also escaped with his life.New investigations show that it is unlikely that the fire was caused by a malfunctioning electrical outlet, as it is now believed that the 3am blaze had two points of origin.

Destroyed: The surviving family members lived in a trailer outside the house while repairs were being made; the father said someone tried to set the trailer ablaze as well

Janis Jaquith, the wife of oldest child Harry Landers, has done extensive research on the fire. A 1970 graduate of Wilmington High School, she has interviewed neighbours and investigators working on the case.

She firmly believes the fire was an act of arson. She wrote in the Wilmington Patch that David Landers, who died two years ago, lived in a trailer next to the house while it was being repaired.

He remembered smelling gasoline around the trailer and found two newspapers soaked in gasoline.However, police never found anyone in conjunction with the attempted arson. 

Mrs McNamara said that the sheer dreadfulness of losing her mother and five siblings in one night meant that the surviving members of her family didn’t speak of the fire for some 40 years.
