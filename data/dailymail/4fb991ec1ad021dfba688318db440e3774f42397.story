Police investigating a brutal attack on a kitten have been left powerless to take court action against the culprits, because they are as young as four.

The 14-week-old animal was swung by her tail, thrown against a wall and kicked ‘like a football’ by the group of three youngsters.

She was rescued by an onlooker, but police could not arrest the children - aged four, five and six, who are believed to be Romanian brothers.

This was because they are under ten - the age of criminal responsibility.

The kitten, Tia, was treated for head injuries, bruised ribs, injured nose and a black eye. She had been choking on blood running from her nose.

Today the kitten’s owner Dawn Tunnacliffe, 33, from Oldham, Greater Manchester, said: ‘I’m very angry about what happened.

‘I understand the children are from Romania. Animals may be treated differently in other countries - but they are not treated like that.

‘Tia was lucky because she has soft bones like a new baby. If she had been an older cat she wouldn’t have survived.’

The incident occurred on September 8 at 6.30pm when Miss Tunnacliffe was in the back yard chatting to her neighbour Lizzie Isaacs.

She said: ‘Tia was playing with some other kittens in the yard when she suddenly went missing.

‘Lizzie went out to check inside her house but then shouted that some children had got hold of Tia in the alley.

'She said they were holding Tia by her tail and kicking her like a football. When she told them to put Tia down, they threw her against a wall.

‘I ran into the alley to find Tia had run off into garden. She was in a lot of distress.’

Miss Isaacs, 23, said: ‘The children 
threw the kitten against a back wall and hit her about five times. I 
screamed at them to put Tia down.

'But they swung her around four times and three her against a wall. They then ran off laughing as Tia hit the wall.

‘We were so angry that we called police. Another of Dawn’s kittens had gone missing and police spoke to the children about it too.

‘They said they didn’t have it but their dad later found that kitten in a bedroom and took it back to Dawn.’

Miss Isaacs’ fiancee Simon Duffy, 28, said: ‘We have three pet cats and a rabbit and these children were stroking one of our cats only 15 minutes before the attack. Now we’ll need to keep our cats indoors.’

A Greater Manchester Police spokesman said: ‘Inquiries are continuing and the incident was logged as criminal damage but because of the young ages of the children there were no arrests.

‘Police are now looking at options which could include a criminal warning and restorative justice such as making the children meet the kitten’s owner to discuss what’s happened.’

Children under 10 who break the law regularly can sometimes be taken into care, or their parents could be held responsible.

Under current legislation police can ban children for up to 90 days from being in a public place between 9pm and 6am, unless accompanied by an adult under the terms of a Local Child Curfew.

If a child breaks their curfew, they can be given a Child Safety Order and placed under the supervision of a youth offending team.

If a child does not stick to the rules of an order, the court can consider if the child should be taken into care.
