Zlatan Ibrahimovic told his team-mates they would struggle without him as he left Inter Milan for Barcelona.

However, they took no notice of his harsh words. The next season a Jose Mourinho-inspired Inter won the treble of the Champions League, Serie A and Coppa Italia.

Former Inter owner Massimo Moratti revealed that the Swede had a damning message for his teammates as he prepared for his last training session in 2009.

The Serie A side were training in the United States when the news came through that one of their star strikers was leaving.

Moratti told Corriere della Sera: 'He was getting on a plane to Barcelona to sign for Barca after the last training with the team and he said: 'It has been nice playing with you but you won't win anything without me.'

The 69-year-old admits he still looks back at Ibrahimovic's time with club, where he won three consecutive Serie A titles, with fond memories.

He added: 'He is an incredibly talented player and above all he makes you win titles. With us he won three straight league championships. The other day I was watching a rerun of our game against Parma in May 2008. Ibrahimovic was fantastic.'
