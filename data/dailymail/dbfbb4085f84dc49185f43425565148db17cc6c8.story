Tragic: Derek Brundrett, 14, was found hanged in the grounds of his school in Pembrokeshire, west Wales

A boy who was found hanged in the grounds of his school yesterday after becoming a victim of bullying has been named today.

Derek Brundrett, 14, was discovered in a wooded area of the playing fields at Pembroke School in Pembrokeshire, west Wales.

Teachers and pupils were in tears after being told the schoolboy had died just days before the school closed for Christmas.

Now, Derek's father David Brundrett has taken to social networking sites to hit out at school bullies after his son's death.

In an emotional post on Facebook, he wrote: 'To my boy Derek. Sorry for not being there for you. Should have tried harder.

'You will always be in my thoughts every minute of every day as you have been since the day you were born.

'I will miss you more than anyone I have ever known.'

He also warned: 'Bullies. I am coming for you, parents of bullies. I will find out where you all live. Now my life is not worth living.'

The 42-year-old had been at his work's Christmas dinner when he had received a call to say his son had been found dead.

Derek, from Monkton, near Pembroke, had turned up to classes as usual on Thursday morning as the 1,350-pupil secondary school started to wind down for the Christmas holidays.

However, his classmates noticed he was missing after the lunch break and a search was launched.

The teenager was found hanged just yards from the school's reception area at around 2pm.

Police and a pathologist were called to the school, while the wooded area was sealed off.

Yesterday, a
Dyfed-Powys Police spokesman said: 'Pembrokeshire Police have 
commenced enquiries into the circumstances surrounding the tragic death 
of a 14 year old boy which occurred in Pembroke Comprehensive School.

Response: Police and a pathologist were called to the school, while the wooded area was sealed off

Policy: The 1,350-pupil secondary school has a dedicated webpage for pupils to report bullying to staff

'Police school liaison officers have been working with the school to ensure the well being of the rest of the pupils.'

Today, students said prayers at the school, which has a dedicated webpage for 
pupils to report bullying to staff.

On the page, students have to give their own name and 
the identity of anyone who is bullying them.

The Pembrokeshire Coroner is due to open an inquest.
