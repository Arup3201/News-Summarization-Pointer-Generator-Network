Ivan the police dog startled himself when he recovered a stolen gun from the snow - and also managed to fire it.

Ivan accidentally pulled the trigger with his paw, firing the loaded semi-automatic pistol into a family home.

Police had sent German Shepherd Ivan to investigate the snow at 2am on Sunday after an officer on patrol heard three gunshots in Lawrence, Massachusetts, and saw a vehicle speed away.

Ivan, a 3-year-old German Shepard police dog, was searching for a gun in a snowbank and accidentally pulled the trigger with his paw, firing the weapon

No humans or dogs were injured when Ivan pulled the trigger

Police had seen Jose Calderon, 28, jump out of a car, and burying something in the snow so they set Ivan to work finding out what he had thrown away.
