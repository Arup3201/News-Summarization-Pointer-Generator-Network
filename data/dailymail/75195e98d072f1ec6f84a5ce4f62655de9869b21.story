He led his team to a dominating 43-8 victory in the Super Bowl XLVIII.

Now, Seattle Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson is expected to become a $100million brand.

The 25-year-old star is expected to be offered a contract featuring a nine-figure sum over the next few years - with further money-making opportunities off the field.

Meanwhile, questions are being raised about the future of Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning's career.

Wilson, who is only in his second year in the NFL, earned $526,217 last year - less than Manning makes per game.

But if he follows in the footsteps of other Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks, he could end up signing a contract of more than £100million, according to Forbes.

In March last year, Joe 
Flacco was offered a six-year, $120.6million contract by the Baltimore 
Ravens - with $52million guaranteed.

Throw: Wilson, who is only in his second year in the NFL, earned $526,217 last year. But if he follows in the footsteps of other Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks, he could end up signing a contract of more than £100m

New-found wealth: Other Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks, including Joe Flacco (left), Aaron Rodgers (right) and Drew Brees have signed contracts of more than $100m - with guarantees of more than $50m

And in April, Aaron Rodgers - who won the Super Bowl in 2011 - signed a five-year, $110million contract extension with the Green Bay Packers - with a record $62.5million guaranteed.

Meanwhile, Drew Brees led the New Orleans Saints to victory in 2010 - before being offered a $100million contract two years later.

Despite only being third-round draft pick on his first contract, Wilson is already one of the NFL's most marketable players - with current endorsement deals including Nike, Alaska Airlines, EA Sports and Levi's.

Last year, his jersey was the league's 
second best seller - succeeded only by that of Peyton Manning, who makes
 more than $5million off the field each year.

However, Wilson will be forced to wait at least a year for his predicted wealth.

The star, who is represented by Mark Rodgers, of Frontline Athlete Management, is tied into his $662,434 salary for this year under the 2011 Collective Bargaining Agreement, which states that rookie 
contracts cannot be renegotiated until three seasons have passed.

It comes as some Broncos fans have been 
questioning Manning's future on the field following his team's defeat by
 the Seahawks on Sunday.

More than a billion global viewers tuned
 into the Super Bowl to watch one of the largest events on the
 sporting calendar.

During the competition, Manning - who could be seen holding his head in shock after the competition - was intercepted twice by the Seahawks' league-best defense.

However, he has since been defended by his teammates and the Broncos's head coach, John Fox.

On the other hand, Wilson completed 72 per cent of his throws for 206 yards and two touchdowns - with 26 yards rushes on three carries.

But despite his stunning performance, he failed to win the Super Bowl MVP award, which was handed to linebacker Malcom Smith.
