Lauren Scruggs elevated her active wear game to new heights in a pretty blue Lululemon tank as she grabbed coffee in West Hollywood with a friend.

The newlywed star completed her look with figure-flattering cropped black leggings, a stunning gold id-tag necklace and a pair of round, John Lennon-esque sunglasses. We would be remiss not to mention her amazing new engagement and wedding band bling!

Lululemon's lightweight, racer-back tank is made out of mesh-lined fabric that is designed to keep you cool and dry during sweat sessions. It even comes with removable padding to flatter both small and larger busts.

While the brand no longer makes their Power Y Tank *Luon in the exact hue of blue that Lauren sports, we love their powder blue option in the image at right. Have a click to find it in a plethora of other colors and patterns and pick whichever one suits your fancy.

Before you buy, don't forget to check out our edit of the best blue workout tanks below. We love the mesh detailing on both the Phat Buddha and Forever 21 versions. The lightning bolts up the sides of the Electric Yoga version lend this classic item a whole new edge.

Scruggs previously recalled the horrific plane propeller accident that left her wondering if anyone would ever love her during her wedding special televised on Monday.

The 26-year-old bride looked back at the accident during the one-hour E! show The Kennedy Wedding: Jason and Lauren Get Married.

'It was just such an incredible time in life. I felt like my career was starting. Everything was rolling really fast and then everything came to a halt,' said the model and fashion blogger.

'On December 3rd, 2011, my mom and I decided to go to our friends house for dinner after church — their house is located on a private airport — and one of the friends was taking people up for plane rides,' recalled the native of Plano, Texas.

'I'm always up for an adventure so I was the first in line. When the plane landed, it was dark and rainy outside and I was getting out of the plane and when you get out you're basically at the propeller, so I was sucked into it when I stepped out,' she revealed. 

The pretty blonde lost her left hand and left eye in the accident and uses prosthetics for both.
