French forces have launched one of their biggest offensives against militants in northern Mali.

About 1,000 troops are sweeping through a river valley believed to be a logistics base for the armed Islamists near Gao - the last major French-led operation before France starts reducing its military presence.

The militants have been driven out of northern cities and towns since France intervened militarily in the West African desert nation last January.

Operation: About 1,000 French troops are sweeping through a river valley believed to be a logistics base for armed Islamists near Gao in Mali

Finds: A French soldier holds a rocket thought to belong to militants near Gao. France has launched its final operation against rebels in Mali before it scales down its military presence there

‘Operation Gustav’ is intended to clear the Gao region of any militants still hiding there and to prevent further suicide attacks in major cities including Gao and the ancient city of Timbuktu.

France wants to search as much of the 
remote region as it can for militant hideouts before it starts scaling 
down its troops from the end of this month.There is concern African forces may not be able to carry out such dragnets once they take over military operations. The
French forces have already ‘neutralised’ stashed caches of artillery 
shells and high-calibre rockets but have not encountered any resistence.

‘We surrounded the valley north of Gao, 
which we believe serves as a logistics base for jihadist groups, and we 
began to search methodically,’ French land forces commander General 
Bernard Barrera said.

Success: French soldiers stand aboard an armored personnel carrier during the Operation 'Gustav.' Islamist militants have been driven out of northern cities since France intervened in Mali

‘This is the fourth dry river valley we have gone into in the Gao region. There will no doubt be other such operations but perhaps not to the same extent,’ he added.France plans to start withdrawing the first of its 4,000 troops later this month and hopes to have only 1,000 soldiers stationed in Mali by the end of the year. The regional African force in Mali currently numbers about 6,300 soldiers.UN chief Ban Ki-moon wants a 11,000-strong UN peace force made up of African troops to be deployed in Mali once France reduces its presence.
