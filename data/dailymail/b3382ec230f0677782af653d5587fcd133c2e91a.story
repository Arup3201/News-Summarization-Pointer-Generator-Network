Survivors of the Fort Hood massacre are suing the U.S. government for allowing a jihadist soldier to rise through the ranks unchecked because of 'political correctness'.

Major Nidal Hasan, 42, is charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder for after launching an attack at the Texas Army post in November 2009.

And on the eve of his trial, which is due to get underway on Tuesday, 148 victims and their relatives are launching a legal claim against the government for $750million (£491 million) for failing to prevent the killings from happening.

Impending trial: Hasan, charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder and 32 counts of attempted premeditated murder, is due to go on trial on August 6

It is alleged military chiefs under the George W Bush and Barack Obama administrations allowed Major Hasan to progress through the ranks despite his increasing jihad extremism because of 'political correctness'.

Reed Rubinstein, the lawyer acting for the group, told the Sunday Telegraph that Major Hasan w as awarded 'preferential treatment' because of his 'ethnicity and his religion'.

He said: 'The rules on the conduct of military officers were ignored. He was a terrible physician and had no business treating soldiers.

'Yet, because of where he came from, and how he prayed to his god, they promoted him and set him loose and ignored his open, very obvious jihadism.'

Mr Rubenstein added that the group wanted the government to meet 'its responsibilities to those harmed by its negligence' over Major Hasan.

Major Nidal Hasan, pictured left in his Army uniform, was apparently allowed to rise through the ranks unchecked despite his 'obvious jihadism'.  Video footage, right, shows him shopping at a 7-11 store wearing a traditional white jubba robe and white kufi skull cap  just outside Fort Hood seven hours before he shot 13 people dead

Major Hasan doesn't deny that he 
carried out the November 2009 rampage at Fort Hood, one of the worst 
mass shootings in U.S. history.

The
attack occurred in a building where hundreds of unarmed soldiers, some 
about to deploy to Afghanistan, were waiting for vaccines and routine 
checkups.

Hasan walked 
inside with two handguns, climbed onto a desk and shouted 'Allahu 
Akbar!' - an Arabic phrase meaning 'God is great!' - then he fired, 
pausing only to reload.

There
are dozens of witnesses who saw it happen but military law prohibits 
him from entering a guilty plea because authorities are seeking the 
death penalty. 

If Hasan is
convicted and sentenced to death there are likely years, if not 
decades, of appeals ahead. He may never make it to the death chamber at 
all.

Ahead of his trial, 
the Army psychiatrist spoke to the American media for the first time 
last week and said that the U.S. government is at war with Islam.

In
the past, Major Nidal Hasan has only spoken via telephone with 
Al-Jazeera, the transcript of which is evidence in his upcoming trial.

'My
complicity was on behalf of a government that openly acknowledges that 
it would hate for the law of Almighty Allah to be the supreme law of the
land,' Hasan said in the lengthy statement released to Fox News on 
Saturday.

He then says in reference to a war on Islam, 'I participated in it.'

'I
would like to begin by repenting to Almighty Allah and apologize to the
Mujahideen, the believers, and the innocent. ... I ask for their 
forgiveness for participating in the illegal and immoral aggression 
against Muslims, their religion and their lands,' he said in the 
statement.

He has twice 
dismissed his lawyers and now plans to represent himself at trial. He's 
suggested he wants to argue the killings were in 'defense of others' - 
namely, members of the Taliban fighting Americans in Afghanistan. The 
trial judge, Col. Tara Osborn, has so far denied that strategy.

Thirteen
officers from around the country who hold Hasan's rank or higher will 
serve on the jury for a trial that will likely last one month and 
probably longer. They must be unanimous to convict Hasan of murder and 
sentence him to death. Three-quarters of the panel must vote for an 
attempted murder conviction.

No active-duty U.S. soldier has been executed since 1961.

The
last man executed in the military system was Pvt. John Bennett, hanged 
in 1961 for raping an 11-year-old girl. Five men are on the military 
death row at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, but none are close to being 
executed.
