A key prosecution witness in the trial of  a former Rutgers University student accused of watching his roommate’s intimate encounter via webcam testified Monday that he texted her multiple times as she was being interviewed by police to make the webcam video broadcast seem like an accident.

‘I think that he thought we were going to get in trouble, so he wanted to make it seem like it was more of an accident,’ Molly Wei, 19, told the court.

Both she and defendant Dharun Ravi, who turned 20 today, viewed the web images of Ravi’s roommate, 18-year-old Tyler Clementi.

Other versions of events: Molly Wei, who was also initially charged with some crimes related to the same event, testified earlier this week about her involvement in the webcam usage

She said Ravi was worried about what she was telling police, and asked her multiple times via text message what exactly she revealed to them.

‘Did you tell them we did it on purpose? What did you tell them when they asked why we turned it on? I said we were just messing around with the camera,’ Ravi said in some of his messages, ABC News reported.

Wei responded saying that she told investigators ‘everything’ that happened the night of September 19, 2010 when Ravi set up a webcam in his and Clementi’s room after Clementi asked to have the room for himself.

Clementi jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge days after that, as the rumours abounded that he was gay.

Wei also testified Monday that she agreed to keep it a secret because it was so shocking to see the images - but that it wasn't under wraps for long.

‘First of all, it was shocking. It felt wrong. We didn't expect to see that. And now that what we did, it was like we shouldn't have seen it,’ Wei told the jurors.

‘We didn't want people to know what had happened.’

But within minutes, she testified, she and defendant Dharun Ravi were online chatting with friends about seeing two men kissing.

Others knew: Defense attorney Steven Altman cross examined witness Scott Xu, a friend of Ravi's who played Ultimate Frisbee with him and claimed was told during a practice, among other teammates, that he had set up the webcam

Within the hour, Ms Wei said, she agreed to show a few seconds of the video stream to four other women who visited her dorm room.

Still, she said, Ravi did not intend to humiliate his roommate. Ravi faces 15 criminal counts, including invasion of privacy and bias intimidation.

To convict him of bias intimidation- the most serious charge he faces- prosecutors would have to persuade jurors that Mr Ravi acted out of bias toward gays.

Wei was charged initially but entered a program that will allow her to keep her record clean if she meets a list of conditions, including doing community service, working or attending school full-time.

She also agreed to cooperate with authorities and testify truthfully in Ravi's trial. She said she has completed about 250 of the 300 hours of community service required.

There is one requirement that was changed for her. She was to go through a program on cyberbullying or dealing with people with ‘alternative lifestyles.’

Witness: Rutgers student Pooja Kolliri testified saying she saw seconds of the webcam's stream of two men kissing which she says shocked her

Since no program like that was offered in Middlesex County, she instead saw a psychologist.

Unlike other more casually dressed 
college students who have testified so far in the trial, Ms Wei wore a 
black business suit.

And unlike the others, she kept her voice audible 
even during the most uncomfortable moments.

She said that she invited Ravi, whom 
she had known since middle school, to her dorm room for a snack a few 
minutes after 9pm on September 19, 2010.

When Ravi tried to go back, 
she said, Mr Clementi told him that he wanted the cramped dorm room to 
himself for a few hours. So Ravi returned.

Within a few minutes, she said, he 
used her computer to view live images from his webcam. It was then, she 
said, that she saw about two seconds of Mr Clementi and an older man 
kissing.

Even though she said they initially 
agreed not to talk about what they had seen, she asked Ravi to tell a
 friend about it during an online chat that began at 9.20pm and within 
minutes, word got around the dorm.

She said she agreed to turn the webcam back on at the request of a woman who was among a group dropped by her room.

‘It was the exact same image, except that they had taken their tops off,’ she said. ‘As soon as they saw it, I turned it off.’

Ms Wei was expected to be back on the witness stand for more cross-examination on Tuesday.

Also Monday, jurors heard from university official William O'Brien that Mr Clementi requested a room change about 30 hours after the alleged spying - and a day before he killed himself.

Mr O'Brien, associate director of residence life at Rutgers, told jurors that his staff did not see Mr Clementi's request for a new roommate until after he was reported missing from campus.

The trial: Ravi is being tried at the Superior Courthouse of New Jersey in New Brunswick
