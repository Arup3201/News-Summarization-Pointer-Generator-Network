Barely two weeks old and sleeping for the camera, this is Maud Elizabeth Daphne Marina - the latest addition to the Royal Family.

The daughter of Lord Freddie Windsor and Sophie Winkleman has taken part in her first celebrity photo shoot.

Maud’s parents are flanked by her proud grandparents, Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, who appear to have colour co-ordinated their outfits to celebrate the arrival of a baby girl.

Prince Michael has also left enough of his pink shirt unbuttoned to reveal a gold crucifix hanging against his chest.

Perhaps his decision to reveal so much chest was influenced by the inhabitants of Los Angeles, where his first grandchild was born on August 15th.

The Michaels’ daughter in law has said she hopes to introduce her daughter to Prince George over Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace.

She told Hello! Magazine that the birth, at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Centre in Los Angeles was ‘long and hard’.

The 33-year-old said: ‘By the end I was begging for a caesarean thinking, I can’t do this anymore - but I managed a natural birth with some wonderful doctors and midwives along with Freddie in the room with me, who were just stunningly brilliant, saying, “You can do this!”. Their dynamic, American positivity carried me through.’

Explaining their choice of name, Lord Freddie, 34, said: ‘We liked the idea of an old-fashioned English name and there are a couple of Princess Mauds in my father’s family from a hundred years ago - one was the youngest daughter of Edward VII who ended up being Queen of Norway, and another was a granddaughter of Edward VII by his daughter Princess Louise.

‘It’s also a beautiful, elegant name and it was always our first choice. Elizabeth is a tribute to the Queen, Daphne is Sophie’s grandmother, who she was very close to and Marina is my paternal grandmother.’

Ms Winkleman, said of her financial analyst husband being present at the birth: ‘He was very brave, because it wasn’t delicate or pretty and I was horrid to him.

‘He read me a crossword clue in the middle of it and I just wanted to throw a saucepan at his head.’

Speaking about his granddaughter, who is 42nd in line to the throne, Prince Michael said: ‘We are absolutely thrilled by the arrival of our beautiful first granddaughter, Maud.

‘We are both besotted with her.

'Not only does she have the prettiest blue eyes and adorable tiny feet, but she is also remarkably well-behaved.’

His wife said they had not met Prince George yet, because they had been on holiday and were ‘preoccupied’ with Maud’s arrival, but hoped to do so at Christmas.

Ms Winkleman, who has starred in the TV sitcoms Peep Show and Two And A Half Men, and married Lord Windsor in September 2009, said: ‘Perhaps we’ll introduce the babies at Buckingham Palace for the Christmas lunch, that would be very sweet.’
