Unemployment is falling faster in Britain than any country in Europe, new official figures showed today.

A jobs surge means that in the last year the UK has overtaken the Czech Republic, Malta and Luxembourg to have the third lowest unemployment rate in all of the EU.

Ministers hailed the figures which show the UK jobless rate at 5.6 per cent, half the Eurozone average.

Unemployment in the UK has fallen sharply to the third lowest level in the UK, while Spain and Greece remains over 20 per cent

Overall 9.8 per cent of people across the 28-nation bloc are out of work, rising to 11.2 per cent among the countries using the euro single currency.

It means a total of 23.8million people are out of work across the EU. The figure in the UK has fallen from more than 8 per cent three years ago, to 5.6 per cent in the latest league table. In the middle of 2013, the UK also had a higher unemployment rate than Denmark and Romania.

Only Germany (4.7 per cent) and Austria (4.8) are now ranked higher in the league table than the UK.

The UK figure has fallen faster than all major economies from 7.1 per cent to 5.6 per cent, the government said.

Employment Minister Esther McVey said: 'Employers across the UK are feeling more confident, investing in people of all ages and these figures today show that the UK is at the top of the jobs growth league of all the major economies.

'The majority of the rise in employment has been in higher skilled jobs, and around 75 per cent has been in full-time work – providing peace of mind to the record numbers of people in work who can now feel more secure about having a steady income.'

The highest unemployment rate is in Greece, where more than a quarter of people are out of work.

The new Greek government has sought to strike a deal with the Eurozone countries on restructuring its debts in a bid to get its economy back on track.

In Spain, 23.4 per cent of people are unemployed, well ahead of the next highest, Croatia on 13.2 per cent.

Youth unemployment across the EU fell by 562,000 to 4.9million, the figures also showed.

In January 2015, the youth unemployment rate was 21.2 per cent in the EU and 22.9 per cent in the eurozone area. In the UK latest figures used by Eurostat show it was 16.1 per cent in November.

Miss McVey added: 'No one in this country should be held back by the idea of a 'no-go career zone.

'As part of our long-term economic plan, we will support even more people develop the right skills and experience so they can fulfil their ambitions and step up to take advantage of the record number of UK vacancies offered in a wide variety of interesting careers.'
