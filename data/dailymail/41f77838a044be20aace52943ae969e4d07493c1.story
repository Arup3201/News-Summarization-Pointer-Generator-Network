Middle class parents are prepared to pay up to 170 per cent property price premiums to live close to Britain’s top primary schools, a new study has found.

Aspirational families seeking to live within the catchment area of a good state primary face price hikes of 40 per cent on similar properties in the same county.

But parents who wish their youngsters to be able to walk to the country’s top independent primaries must pay an extra 170 per to buy homes nearby.

Middle class parents are prepared to pay up to 170 per cent property price premiums to live close to Britain's top primary schools, a new study has found

Those near Cambridge fee-paying St John's College School pay 160.8 per cent more

The study calculated the premiums on house prices in the postcodes of the top 50 fee-paying and top 50 state primary schools outside London, against the average property price for the county.

And the results revealed the financial lengths pushy parents will stretch themselves to in order to get their children into Britain’s best schools.

While independent schools do not have a catchment area, well-heeled parents often prefer to move close-by so they will benefit from a shorter morning school run in the car or enable their children to walk.

Justin Marking, of estate agent Savills, said: ‘We see that competition is huge to get into good primary schools and parents are keen to make a pre-emptive strike and move close to put themselves in the right place before their children reach school age.’

Janette Wallis, of The Good Schools Guide, said: ‘For the first child, the primary school seems to be the be-all and end-all.

‘It’s natural for all parents with their first child to want the best school for them. It can feel crucial and it is very important.

‘Parents might use private prep schools in areas where there are grammar schools in the hope that an early spend will lead to a grammar place.’
