Hell-raising sports star he most definitely isn't.

After documentary makers spent a year filming tennis champion Andy Murray, they admitted what many of us already suspected: he's pretty ordinary.

Forget fathering children in laundry cupboards or smashing up hotel rooms - a good weekend for the 26-year-old Scotsman is spent at home, playing with his dogs and eating takeaway sushi. 

Andy Murray, who took on France's Nicolas Mahut at London's Queen's Club today, doesn't lead a flash life, a film-maker said today

And a bad weekend involves a bad result from his fantasy football team.

Film-maker Jo McCusker, who trailed Murray around the world for her programme, has lifted the lid on the world of ice baths, early nights and six-hour training sessions that constitute the life of this top flight tennis player.

She said he did nothing other than train, eat, sleep and travel.

'You don't see anything flash because he doesn't do anything flash,' she told the Radio Times.

'He doesn't drink, doesn't smoke, doesn't go out.

'And it all comes back to one word, mentioned by everyone we spoke to - "ordinary".'

Murray, who today took on France's Nicolas Mahut at the AEGON Tennis Championships at London's Queen's Club, is filmed during a six-hour 'boot camp' training session in Miami, during which he did Pilates, Bikram yoga, weights, speed-work and, of course, tennis.

He then had to spend ten minutes in a freezing ice bath to rid his body of lactic acid, with a cup of sweets to lure him in.

Miss McCusker said his determination and focus on being the best could make Murray appear aloof, but said she had been surprised by his manners, wit, and droll sense of humour.

She described Murray as laid-back with other people but hard on himself, and said he wore his heart on his sleeve.

'There isn't an Andy that goes into a press conference and an Andy outside of it; he doesn't edit himself.'

During the filming, the team also followed Murray visiting Dunblane Primary School where his famously ambitious mother, Judy, was giving a tennis lesson to youngsters.

The school, which Murray attended, was the scene of an appalling massacre in 1996 when gunman Thomas Hamilton killed 17 people before shooting himself.  Murray, who has never spoken publicly about the tragedy, sheltered in a classroom during the shooting.

The film-makers said the visit to Dunblane, during which Murray - fresh from a win at the U.S Open - spent hours shyly signing autographs and posing with children, was the most poignant moment during the year.

In the Radio Times interview, Miss McCusker said: 'It was quietly moving to see how much the Murray siblings - his brother Jamie is also a professional tennis player - mean to that school and the Dunblane community.'

The documentary covers the entourage behind the professional tennis player, which includes his coach, former player Ivan Lendl, his hitting partner Danny Vallverdu, and trainers Jez Green and Matt Little, physio Andy Ireland and Matt Gentry from Simon Fuller's XIX Entertainment.

Miss McCusker said Murray took some flak over the size of his team, but said he defended it by saying it was crucial to his success at such a high level.

She also said Murray was friendly with other players off the court, and enjoyed playing PlayStation with rivals like Rafael Nadal, whom he has known since they were both children.

Andy Murray: The Man Behind The Racquet, will be shown on BBC1, June 23.
