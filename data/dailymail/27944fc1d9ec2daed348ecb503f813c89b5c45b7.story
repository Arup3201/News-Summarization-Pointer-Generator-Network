'Murdered': Shaun Corey (pictured), the boyfriend of Karen Otmani who allegedly killed him then kept his body in a wheelie bin in her bedroom for 11 days

A woman killed her boyfriend and kept his body in a wheelie bin in her bedroom for 11 days, a court heard today.

When police found Shaun Corey, 42, his body was so decomposed they could not say how he died.

Karen Otmani, 42, had been talking about getting rid of her on-off lover and had even asked another boyfriend to experiment with some blue liquid to see if it would knock him out, Bobbie Cheema, prosecuting, told the Old Bailey.

Miss Cheema said: 'But when she began to speak about killing Mr Corey, he did not take it seriously.

Mr Corey was last seen at Otmani’s home in Forest Hill, south London, on June 4 last year.

Miss Cheema said he was heard arguing with Otmani in her bedroom before they were joined by Bernard Beddoe, 60, who she called uncle.

After about 10 minutes, it went quiet and Otmani and Beddoe went into the kitchen to make a drink, the court heard.

Miss Cheema added: 'Shaun Corey died at the hands of these two defendants.

'His body was found during a search of Karen Otmani’s bedroom. It was hidden inside of a large green wheelie bin.'

The court heard Mr Corey was tied to Otmani's bed before he was killed.

A post mortem found an 'acute dose' of a drug Xanax in his body - a treatment for anxiety which causes drowsiness, sedation and a reduced alertness.

Miss Cheema said Beddoe had gone to Otmani's flat when Mr Corey was still alive.

The victim was drugged, taken into Otmani's bedroom and tied to her bed.

'He had been shouting - no doubt from fear having found himself being tied up on Otmani's bed,' Miss Cheema said.

'Beddoe was a willing accomplice before, during and after the murder of Shaun Corey.'

The body was wrapped in four layers of tarpaulin and packaging before it was packed into a blue plastic box.

It was then put into the wheelie bin in the bedroom.

When the packing was examined shoe prints belonging to both the accused killers were found on the tarpaulin.

Otmani will admit taking part in the killing of her boyfriend but will claim that she acted out of a 'sudden loss of control.'

She will also say she was the victim of 'battered women' syndrome and had been attacked by both Mr Corey and other men.

But Miss Cheema said: 'She was an emotional and manipulative woman.'She had toyed with the idea of killing Shaun a long time before June 4.'Beddoe will deny taking part in the murder at all.

A boy who heard Mr Corey being killed told police in a video taped interview that Otmani and the victim were 'always arguing.'

He said they were shouting at each other before he got up on the morning Mr Corey was killed.

The boy said he went upstairs to watch television but could still hear them yelling at eachother.

'Ten minutes later the arguing stopped. They stayed down there for a little while.

'Then they came up. They were making drinks and that. I thought they may have killed Shaun.'

But he said after the incident both Beddoes and Otmani 'acted as normal.'

Otmani and Beddoe deny murder.

Beddoe, of Brockley, south-east London, also denies an alternative charge of assisting Otmani knowing she had killed Mr Corey.

The trial continues.
