A new study has found that men who treat their sleep apnoea experience a better sex life.

The study involved 61 men from Melbourne and Sydney who suffered from sleeping disorder and erectile difficulties and found that both conditions improved with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment.

Kerri Melehan, the leader of the study from Sydney's Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, told Daily Mail Australia that the treatment improved the 'overall sexual satisfaction' of the men involved as the two conditions often come hand in hand.

'What normally happens during sleep is that men have erections during REM sleep around about every 90 minutes and when they wake up with erection that's because they woke up in the middle of REM,' Dr Melehan said. 

'But, if you have sleep apnoea, that can interrupt your sleep and in particular it interrupts REM sleep and also the erections that's should be happening, so it doesn't get that practice overnight that's needed.'

Dr Melehan said her study, which took place between 2010 and 2013, tested men who had never bene treated for sleep apnoea.

Out of the 61 men, 30 received CPAP treatment and 31 received a placebo treatment. A different selection of 31 men were also given an erectile dysfunction drug while the remaining 30 received a placebo.

'Some guys got both, some got none and the rest got one,' Dr Melehan explained.

'Over the three months we asked them about their sexual activity and how their erections were going and we also measured their erections during their sleep and we found CPAP increased the number of those.

'We can report that if you are a man with sleep apnoea and erectile dysfunction you're better of being treated for sleep apnoea than using drugs to treat the erectile dysfunction, but for some men it doesn't necessarily work.

'That's because there a lot of things that can be attributed to erectile dysfunction and for those guys, drugs do work. But even so, there are advantages in treating the sleep apnoea.'

Dr Melehan said that she hopes the results of her study, which will be revealed at the 26th annual Australasian Sleep Conference in Perth this week, will encourage and motivate men to treat their sleeping disorders. 

The scientific conference will open at the Perth Convention Centre on Thursday, October 9 and wrap up on Saturday, October 11.

Sleeping disorders and erectile difficulties can both be improved with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment.
