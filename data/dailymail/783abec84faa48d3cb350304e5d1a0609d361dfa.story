Phil Jagielka is one of the Premier League's honest professionals. He probably knew he had not played well on Thursday night against Uruguay, yet he was prepared to discuss the performance and reflect on England's campaign.

'World Cup football at its worst,' said Jagielka, describing the disappointment, before he was quizzed on some of the positive aspects of the attacking play and the emergence of younger players. 

'Yeah, but we've not come to this tournament just to blood youngsters, turn up and hopefully they do well. We've come here to do well, to perform and to qualify.'

Downbeat: Steven Gerrard, Phil Jagielka, Daniel Sturridge and Glen Johnson during training on Saturday

It was succinct and correct. There might be some building blocks for Euro 2016 from the rubble of this World Cup but five-year plans are football's biggest cliche. The trick of the job is to get results while developing a team.

Roy Hodgson needs to be judged on what happened in Brazil, not on what might happen in France in two years' time, and even with expectations at an all-time low he managed to underachieve here.

Everyone wanted to see progress in Brazil but nobody said there was a free pass to lose the opening two games. England had a difficult group but nobody anticipated them being out within five days.

And though everyone was aware Luis Suarez would be a huge threat, it was not unreasonable to expect to match a nation of three million and a country which finished fifth in the South American group and qualified by beating Jordan in a play-off. 

'Results colour everything,' said Hodgson. 'Results colour your judgment, colour everybody's judgment. I'm happy with the way the players prepared for these games and the way they approached the tournament. I'm really happy with the dedication and effort they have put in. But we've played two experienced and strong teams and on both occasions we've come out second.'

At the heart of this World Cup campaign is a conundrum. How was Hodgson - a coach associated with meticulous planning, rigid team shape and solidity - undone by an excess of attacking?

Disappointment: England were undone by defensive lapses against Italy and Uruguay

Almost everyone embraced the idea of aggressive, forward-thinking football. Indeed, the biggest fear was Hodgson would fail to embrace the public mood. Pundits, media, players and public were united that it was the way forward and because it has failed that does not mean the idea was a bad one.

Hodgson galvanised the nation with a defeat last Saturday because England looked like a proper international team. But in our desire to be something more than the dire 2010 team or the less-than-dynamic 2006 squad, we overdid the enthusiasm. Certainly foreign journalists were bemused by the phlegmatic reaction to defeat.

Now it would be trite to carry on regardless and without modification. England should play on the front foot and the nature of the players emerging dictates that they will.

That said, at times it looked as though England were stuck in sixth gear, racing forwards and unable to move down through the cogs when required. The intention was to play with full backs pushed on, as is the fashion, to overwhelm the opposition. And it worked on occasions. 

When Daniel Sturridge released Glen Johnson to get into the box and set up Wayne Rooney for his goal against Uruguay, there was the proof. Leighton Baines, criticised for his defensive work, was singled out by Diego Maradona for causing Uruguay problems.

Forward planning: Wayne Rooney could take over Steven Gerrard's playmaker role

However, 
there is a flipside. Baines being so far forward as England attacked 
just before Suarez's opening goal affected the defensive shape and 
allowed the Liverpool striker to drift between the left-back and 
Jagielka to score.

The
 goal for which Baines received most blame, when Italy's Antonio 
Candreva turned him the wrong way to cross for Mario Balotelli,  had as 
much to do with Danny Welbeck's positioning. As an instinctive forward 
player, Welbeck could not get back in time to prevent the run of Matteo 
Darmian, leaving Baines exposed.

That, however, is the manner of modern football. Full-backs have to be great attackers and solid defenders. Baines proved adept at one part of the task, but not the other.

Indeed, England's defensive shape was the most worrying aspect of the tournament. Hodgson cannot suddenly conjure better defenders - though Ashley Cole's absence and the unwillingness to bring back John Terry look unwise now - but this manager's teams are traditionally well organised.

In a conversation after the Peru warm-up game, Hodgson was complimented on the team's set-pieces, yet he was nonplussed. 'What we worked hard on (in Portugal) was our shape,' he said. 'I'd have been much happier if you'd said to me, "I thought the shape of the team was good tonight".'

Big fan: Diego Maradona singled out England defender Leighton Baines for praise

For the first 30 minutes against Italy 
and for 25 minutes in the second half against Uruguay, the shape was 
good and the tactics worked. Yet in the key moments which decided both 
games, defenders were pulled out of position. Had Hodgson set up 
cautiously like he did at Euro 2012, he might have been vilified but 
would probably have two points by now. As a coach, he performed better 
two years ago when he coaxed more from a limited group.

Then there is the issue of Steven Gerrard. Uruguay nullified him with a simple game plan which had all the hallmarks of Suarez's inside knowledge. Stop Gerrard distributing the ball from the back and  England become a disjointed and nervous team in possession. Nicolas Loderio and Edinson Cavani did that job excellently. They also harried Jagielka and Cahill, meaning England rarely had any fluidity and could not establish a passing game. Disrupting England ought not to be so simple.

Gerrard may well retire from international football this week and England have a dearth of players who can fulfil his midfield holding role, which is going to be Hodgson's biggest problem now.

Perhaps Wayne Rooney will one day do the job. Those who have managed him believe that is a serious possibility. For now Hodgson will stay and choose to take the positives. 'I believe England have a very strong basis for a team,' he said. 'It's a very young team. In the space of two years these players have to get  better and stronger. Playing together as an England team will make them better and stronger.

Influence: England could have done with experience of John Terry and Ashley Cole in Brazil

'I've never doubted that as this team move forward, not just to 2016 but even on from there, they will do so. But for the moment they have to suck on this very, very bitter pill that their hopes and dreams have floundered here because we weren't able to win the games.'

An absence of viable alternatives means Hodgson will be allowed to continue. However, he can't always be looking two years ahead. Attacking football is part of the answer but England failed playing it in Brazil. 

If Hodgson doesn't make changes, if he cannot uncover better defenders and it proves impossible to replace Gerrard, England will stay in the realm of five-year plans, bright futures and false hope for the next big tournament.
