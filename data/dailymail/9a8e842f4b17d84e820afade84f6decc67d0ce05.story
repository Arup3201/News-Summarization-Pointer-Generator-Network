A North Carolina woman known in the media as 'paralyzed bride' after she became a quadriplegic when a friend jokingly pushed her into a shallow pool at her bachelorette party has opened up about the incident, and shed some light on the relationship she currently has with the friend who pushed her into the pool more than four years ago.

Rachelle Friedman has been promoting her new book - The Promise: A Tragic Accident, A Paralyzed Bride and the Power of Love, Loyalty and Friendship - by giving media interviews over the last several months to talk about her tragic story, and what her life has been like learning to live life as a quadriplegic.

Last week, Friedman participated in an AMA (Ask Me Anything) on the social news-sharing website Reddit.com, and the question about her relationship with the friend who pushed her in the pool was brought up.

Pact: Friedman's mother says the women at her daughter's bachelorette party have made a silent pact to never publicly reveal who pushed her into the pool

Paralysis: Friedman broke her neck when a friend jokingly pushed her into a shallow pool during her bachelorette party

Friedman has described the incident that left her paralyzed as an 'innocent' accident, and a Reddit user wanted to know how that friend acted around her now, four years after her 'innocent' push left Friedman without the ability to walk.

'Neither one of us are as giggly and carefree as we used to be,' Friedman wrote in response to the question. 'We were always really responsible but I mean we were in our low 20s just right out of college without a care in the world. So obviously age, life and the accident has changed how we act. She used to be really really awkward around me because when we weren't talking about the accident it felt like we were avoiding it. Over the years we've normalized everything to an extent. We can laugh, and talk about other things so it's not as awkward.'

Parents-to-be: A tragic accident at Rachelle Friedman's bachelorette party in 2010 left her paralyzed. Now, she's revealed she and husband Chris (left) are trying to have a baby via surrogate

Hopeful: The couple have launched a Go Fund Me campaign to fund the surrogacy, with the goal of raising $60,000 from donations. 'It is the final piece to our happiness so I really hope this happens for us,' she said

One of the things Friedman discusses 
in her book is how she and her five friends who were with her at the 
bachelorette party have developed an unspoken pact to never reveal 
publicly which of the woman playfully pushed Friedman into the pool.

'She is totally fine with the girl who pushed her in the pool, 
Friedman's mother, 55-year-old Carol Friedman, said in an interview with
 ABC News. 'No one knows who it is and we never say her name 
[publicly].'

'In the beginning, we worried about the girl,' Friedman's mother continued. 'But through 
the years, we have talked about it and she has gotten so much better. We
 have worried about her a lot.'

Carol Friedman lives with her daughter and son-in-law because 
insurance does not cover caregivers.

Friedman has also revealed that she and her husband, Chris, are trying to have a baby via-a surrogate.

Desperate times: While the North Carolina native (left, before the accident and right, on her wedding day) is biologically able to have children, her medications would be harmful to a fetus

Hopes and dreams: 'I want a child more than anything,' she tweeted last month

The 28-year-old, who is paralyzed from the chest down, told xoJane
 that welcoming a new little member into their family 'is the final 
piece to our happiness, so I really hope this happens for us.'

As such, she and husband Chris have launched a Go Fund Me campaign to fund the surrogacy, with the goal of raising $60,000 from donations.

'I see baby announcements flooding my 
Facebook timeline on a regular basis, and it makes my baby alarm clock 
go off every time I see a new one,' she confessed.

'It's hard not to feel envy for how easy 
it will likely be... for all of my girlfriends 
to have kids and be active moms.

'I don't know how I'll handle it when 
that time comes, but I will tell you I'm moving towards being a mother 
myself,' she revealed.

The
 Raleigh, North Carolina native explained that while she is still 
biologically able to have children in her condition, her medications 
would be harmful to a fetus.

In order not to take any chances, 'I am having to consider 
alternate methods,' she wrote.

According
 to her fundraising page, the total cost of surrogacy is about $120,000,
 but an organization called Surrogacy Together is helping them reach 
that amount.

'I want a child more than anything,' she tweeted on Monday, appealing to her followers: 'Help me complete my happiness
