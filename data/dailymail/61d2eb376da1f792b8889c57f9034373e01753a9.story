Nazir Afzal (above) has resigned from the Crown Prosecution Service despite being cleared of improper conduct

One of the UK's most senior prosecutors dramatically resigned yesterday despite being cleared of improper conduct.

Nazir Afzal, who led the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in North West England, was accused of sending a text message to a defendant.

An internal inquiry exonerated the highly experienced lawyer, who was honoured by The Queen in 2005, of any wrongdoing.

But he nevertheless handed in his resignation as more senior colleagues insisted his departure is due to an 'on-going drive for efficiency'.

The resignation is a direct blow to Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders who has faced criticism for pursing campaign agendas instead of serving the general public.

Mr Afzal proved himself to be an outspoken advocate of bringing to justice those accused of the most heinous and sometimes sensitive offences.

This included a move to overturn an earlier decision on an Asian Rochdale sex grooming ring that led to a series of convictions.

He said that an over-sensitivity to political correctness and 'fear of appearing racist' by 'white professionals' may have stalled justice.

More recently he was responsible for the successful conviction of disgraced former BBC presenter Stuart Hall.

He also led the prosecutions of Coronation Street actors Bill Roache, who was cleared of rape, and Michael Le Vell, who was also acquitted of child sex abuse.

Mr Afzal took up his post in 2011 and led a huge team of about 700 lawyers, legal staff, and administrators.

He was responsible for all criminal prosecutions across Greater Manchester, Lancashire, and Cumbria.

Earlier this week his staff received an email earlier this week saying it had always been his intention to step down in 2015.

In the four-line email, Mr Afzal said there was 'no secret reason' why he was leaving after 25 years with the CPS.

After studying law in Birmingham, Mr Afzal qualified as a solicitor and worked in private practice until he joined the CPS in 1991.

He began his CPS career in central London and has prosecuted and advised on many high profile cases.

Mr Afzal was awarded an OBE in the Queen's New Years Honours List in 2005 for his public service and involvement with the local community.

A CPS spokesman said: 'We are continuing to reduce the number of staff employed across the organisation and Nazir Afzal is leaving the Service as part of this ongoing drive for efficiency.

'This is entirely unrelated to any issue of conduct and we are satisfied that there has been no impropriety on the part of Mr Afzal.'
