Some of cinema's most famous lines are not what you think they are - the words have become  commonly recited misquotes as they are endlessly repeated by fans.

From cinema classics Field Of Dreams to The Wizard Of Oz and Dirty Harry, characters' lines have been slightly altered over the years, meaning they are no longer remembered in their original form.

One misquote from an early Disney film has become so ingrained in cinema lore that it was used as the title of another movie.

Scroll down for videos of how the lines were actually said

Field Of Dreams: Kevin Costner's character actually hears the line 'If you build it, HE will come'

Mirror, Mirror, the 2012 movie starring Lily Collins and Julia Roberts, appears to be named after a line from Disney’s animated version of Snow White, made in 1937.

However, Snow White's evil stepmother Queen Grimhilde actually says something else entirely.

Instead of: ‘Mirror, mirror on the wall,’ the queen says: ‘Magic mirror on the wall.’

The signature quote from another children’s favorite, The Wizard of Oz, is also frequently misquoted.

When Dorothy lands in Oz, most movie-goers believe that Judy Garland's character turns to her little dog and says: ‘Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.’

Empire Strikes Back: When Luke Skywalker believes Darth Vader has killed his father, Vader corrects him, but not using his name. The correct line is: 'No. I am your father'

THE WIZARD OF OZ

Misquote: 'Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.'

Line: 'Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.'

FIELD OF DREAMS

Misquote: ‘If you build it, they will come.’

Line: 'If you build it, he will come.'

THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK

Misquote: 'Luke, I am your father.'

Line: 'No. I am your father.'

DIRTY HARRY

Misquote: 'Do you feel lucky, punk?'

Line: ‘You've got to ask yourself one question. Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk?’

If fact, the line that appeared in the script actually runs: ‘Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.’

Set not far from Kansas in the state of Iowa, Field of Dreams, the Oscar-nominated 1989 film starring Kevin Costner, James Earl Jones and Burt Lancaster, is another commonly misquoted movie.

Most people think that the character Terence Mann, played by James Earl Jones, tells Kevin Costner’s Ray Kinsella: ‘If you build it, they will come.’

In fact, the line is something slightly different: ‘If you build it, he will come.’

James Earl Jones is also behind another of cinema's most common misquotes when he provided the voice for Darth Vader in Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back.

A slightly raspier version of Jones's voice is often believed to say: ‘Luke, I am your father.’

Actually, Jones’ character Darth Vader
 says: ‘No. I am your father,’ when Luke Skywalker mistakenly accuses 
the character of killing his father.

In
 Dirty Hairy, Clint Eastwood doesn’t say: 'Do you feel lucky, punk?' 
when he makes his final approach to an injured criminal as is commonly 
believed.

Instead, the line goes: ‘You've got to ask yourself one question. Do I feel lucky? Well, do ya, punk?’

Which might be a good question to ask yourself the next time you feel inclined to quote from your favorite movie script.

The Wizard Of Oz: When Dorothy lands in Oz, most people believe she said: 'Toto, I don't think we're in Kansas anymore.' If fact, the line runs: 'Toto, I've a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore.'

Dirty Harry: The famous line from Clint Eastwood's 1971 film 'Do you feel lucky, punk?' is actually erroneous
