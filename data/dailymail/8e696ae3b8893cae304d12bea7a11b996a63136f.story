A 16-year-old student found dead in her home had been tormented by bullies, her friends claim.

The body of Shannon Gee was discovered at her family house in Camborne, Cornwall, on Sunday afternoon.

Friends' comments suggest that Shannon may have killed herself after a campaign of bullying by ‘ugly, evil people’.

Tormented: 16-year-old Shannon Gee was found dead at her home on Sunday. She had been the victim of bullying

Many people vented their anger and sorrow on tribute pages on social networking sites.

One, Sarah Hoswell, said: 'Those heartless people [who] made your life hell should be made to pay for what they put you through.

'They are nothing but bullies who drove a beautiful young girl to do something so drastic, makes me mad that these people will most probably get away with this kind of behaviour.'

A primary school friend, Samantha Mitchell, said: 'You shouldn’t have let them b******s get the best of you, you don’t deserve it.'

Kelly Winterbourne warned: 'It’s only a matter of time before this happens again. Something needs to be done about bullies the minute somebody feels upset, scared and vulnerable.

'It should be taken very seriously, nobody deserves to have [a] life that is unlivable. Your bully will have blood on their hands til the day they die', she wrote.

Carol Collington said: 'So sad that this beautiful young girl died because of some ugly evil bullies.'

Others said they hoped the bullies would be made accountable for their actions and hoped her family would get justice for her.

Helen Rosevear said ‘hope you bullies are proud of yourselves’.

Police said her death was not being treated as suspicious and an inquest has been opened and adjourned.

The Pool Academy student’s death has left staff and students ‘deeply shocked and saddened’.

Principal Zelma Hill said: 'Shannon was a lovely girl who went out of her way to help other students. She was passionate about drama and excelled in food technology.'

Hundreds of heartwarming messages were left by her schoolfriends.

One, from Beth Louise, said: 'I’ll miss you smiling all the time. You’re a great loss but I hope you’re happy and free now.'
