An avenue of oak trees planted at the start of the millennium in the hope they will last 1000 years face being axed after just 13 years due to a new development plans.

Members of the Launceston in Bloom Association planted 100 English oak trees and 120,000 daffodils in 2000 to enhance the gateway into the ancient Cornish market 
town.

But now the trees which line Millennium Avenue  could be ripped out to make way for a supermarket and hotel development.

Campaign: Launceston Save Our Trees campaign march along the avenue which is lined with 100 English oak trees

The plans which have riled many locals, are currently under examination by Cornwall council.

Developer Wessex Investors, which intends to build a Morrisons supermarket, a Premier Inn hotel and up to 275 homes in the Pennygillam area of Launceston later this year, insists there is no other option and their plan would provide 400 new jobs to local people.

'This has been on the drawing board for 
nearly two years and we are trying to accommodate everyone the best we 
can,'  managing director Andrew Pegg told The Independent.

Dispute: Margaret Wills, chairman of Launceston in Bloom Association says that even just one away would spoil an beautiful creation designed for generations to come

'While five will be removed 
under current plans, we intend to plant 93 trees in the new 
development.'

But Margaret Wills, chairman of 
Launceston in Bloom Association told This Is Cornwall that even just one
away would spoil an beautiful monument designed for generations to 
come.

"The removal of any of the 100 Oak trees would totally ruin the wonderful avenue, providing a visual amenity of high class screening and landscaping, environmental enhancement and an essential green space for Launceston."

Mrs Wills added: "The Millennium Avenue must be totally protected in their entirety for the whole community and to enable countless generations to fully appreciate their magnificence and beauty."

Mrs Wills told the Cornish Guardian earlier this month that she had delivered 1,740 letters of objection to the planning office.

A report was commissioned by the group to assess the level of damage.

Nigel Powell, of Glendale Countryside, said in the report: 'Any development close to these trees is likely to have some impact on them and ideally would be avoided. They must be allowed to grow freely, away from development that might restrict their routes or require their developing crowns to be pruned.

'It is important that the 100 trees planted remain as such, 100 trees, the number as discussed corresponding with 1,000 years.'
