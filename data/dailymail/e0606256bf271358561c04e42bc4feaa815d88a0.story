Frustrating: Claire Lennon will have to wait for her pet Sarah to die before she can get her earring back

An unlucky woman whose pet cockerel swallowed her diamond earring will have to wait until it dies to retrieve her precious jewellery.

Claire Lennon from Berkshire lost her earring when cockerel Sarah pecked it off while perched on her shoulder.

She will have to wait eight years to get her hands on the £300 present that her partner Adam, 38, gave her again.

Vets say it is trapped inside the stomach of six-month-old Sarah and will not come out.

Claire, also 38, said 'The vet said he could operate to recover the earring, but that might kill Sarah, which would devastate our six-year-old daughter Mia'.

'So we’ll have to wait till Sarah gets old and dies, but they live to a ripe old age - we are probably looking at another eight years before I get my earring back.'

Sarah, who is in fact a cockerel despite having a hen's name, is a family pet who loves sitting on Claire’s shoulder at home near Newbury.

Claire explained: 'I felt this sudden sharp pain in my ear lobe and realised Sarah had gobbled down the earring'.

She and Adam, an IT specialist, put the chicken in a cage and spent the next few days searching the floor in case the earring had passed through the chicken.

'But there was sign of it and Mia’s friend’s father, who’s a vet, said it might have got stuck in the gizzard.'

Irretrievable: A vet's x-ray shows the diamond earring inside Sarah, which would be too dangerous to cut out

'We spoke to another vet, Carl Gorman, who said he would do an X ray.

'The X ray showed it was stuck firmly in the gizzard so Carl gave Sarah some laxatives, hoping it would pass.

'But it didn’t work, it’s still stuck fast and we have accepted it is trapped inside and won’t come out.

Missing: Claire's surviving earring, worth £300

'The vet said he could operate and go in through Sarah’s stomach but it could prove fatal.

'We couldn’t face that - Mia adores Sarah and would be heart-broken.

“The vet said over the weeks and months, the platinum white gold would disintegrate and be ground down by the grit and stuff that hens eat to aid their digestion.

'But the diamond is so hard it will not be damaged and will just stay there in the until Sarah dies and then of course we can get it back.'

Claire explained why Sarah is in fact a cockerel.

She said: 'He’s called Sarah because when we got him as a chick, we thought he was a she.

'When he got older and we realised it was a cockerel, we decided to stick with the name.

'We’re keeping as close eye on him to make sure he doesn’t get caught, carried off and eaten by a fox or the diamond will be gone forever.

'It’s a shame I have lost the earring because it was one of a matching pair that Adam bought for me so they’re really sentimental and mean a lot.

'But we can’t risk anything that might mean we lose Sarah.

'At least we know where the earring is - and one day I will get it back, even if it means waiting for a few years!'
