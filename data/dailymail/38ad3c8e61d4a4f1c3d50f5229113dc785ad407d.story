Murdered: Rachel Wilson, 19, who went missing from the Southfield Road area of Middlesbrough, where she was a sex worker, in May 2002

The family of a teenager murdered after going missing a decade ago made an emotional plea today as police confirmed they had found her body.

Rachel Wilson, 19, disappeared from Middlesbrough, where she was a sex worker, in May 2002.

Cleveland Police today confirmed that human remains found on farmland on the outskirts of the town three weeks ago were hers and said they had reopened the investigation into Rachel's death as a murder inquiry.

Speaking at a press conference at the force's headquarters in Middlesbrough, her mother, Tina Wilson, accompanied by Rachel's brother Carl, said: 'For the last ten years we've been sure she'll come in the house. On Friday we found out she wouldn't.

'All I'm asking for is somebody that knows, come forward and let us know and let us find out what happened to Rachel.'

The teenager had turned to prostitution to feed a drug addiction that had blighted her life since the age of 16.

The last sighting known of her was at about 3.30am on May 
31, 2002, when CCTV images showed her walking along Southfield Road in 
the town’s centre.

Her remains were found in a shallow grave at 6.15pm on Wednesday, June 27, by a farmer who was working on his land at the Newham Hall Farm estate in Middlesbrough.

Following the discovery, the area was placed under police guard, with two marked cars and the entrance taped off. The white forensic tents at the scene sparked speculation on social networking sites, with locals taking to Facebook to express their concern. The tents have now been removed from the site.

Appeal: Today Rachel's mother Tina and brother Carl (pictured at a press conference) appealed to anyone with information about what happened to her daughter to come forward. Her remains were found on a farm last month

The news is likely to rock the community of Beechwood where Rachel grew up. She had attended Beechwood Primary and Hall Garth schools and worked for a time at a care home in Eston.

A 57-year-old man was arrested in 2003 following her disappearance but released without charge.

At one point 100 officers were working on the investigation, which has been led by several senior figures over the last decade.

Detective Superintendent Peter McPhillips said the investigation will 
focus on those who frequented the area in which Rachel's body was found.

'Obviously one of our lines of inquiry is to see who was accessing that 
site and that may well encompass people who use prostitutes,' he said.

Case re-opened: Rachel Wilson had turned to prostitution to feed a drug addiction that had blighted her life since the age of 16. The last sighting known of her was at about 3.30am on May 
31, 2002, on CCTV images

'My message to them is this: It's 
never too late to do the right thing.' He said the discovery represents 
'some closure' for Rachel's family but many fundamental questions 
remain.

'The anguish they have suffered over the years is unimaginable but they 
have never given up hope that Rachel will return home again,' he said.

'There's been a post-mortem examination carried out and we cannot confirm how she died. It's going to be really difficult. We have got no cause of death, there
was no clothing there.' He added that there was a chance police may 
never know how she died.

Grief: Rachel's mother Tina described her daughter as a 'bubbly character' who 'always wanted to be centre of attention'

Police said 'at this moment' they are not treating the murder as being linked to two others that happened around the same time.

Vicky Glass was 21 when she vanished from Middlesbrough town centre in 
2000 and her body was found in Danby, in rural North Yorkshire.

The body
of Donna Keogh, who went missing from a Middlesbrough house party in 
1998, has never been found.

'Rachel disappeared in 2002 and at that time other girls disappeared. 
But there is nothing to suggest this is linked to other inquiries,' said
Mr McPhillips.

During appeals at the time of Rachel's disappearance, police said they 
believed she was working as a prostitute in the Southfield Road area of 
Middlesbrough.

Officers have already investigated and ruled out links with the Suffolk Strangler murders in 2006.

Speaking on the 10th anniversary of Miss Wilson’s disappearance in May, Ms Wilson  had spoken fondly of Rachel, describing her as 'a bubbly character' who 'always wanted to be centre of attention'.

Temporary Detective Chief Inspector Gordon Lang also said at the time: 'Rachel visited her family regularly, and was always in touch with one of them on a daily basis.

'Someone somewhere has knowledge of where she went and what happened to her all those years ago, and I am appealing for them to get in touch and tell us what they know.

'Last November we released CCTV footage of Rachel in Middlesbrough town centre and today, 10 years on from her disappearance, we are hoping to uncover what happened to her and bring closure for her family.'
