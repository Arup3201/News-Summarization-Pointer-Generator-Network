The mother of a woman accidentally shot by her boyfriend - who thought she was a hog while they were on a hunting trip - has condemned those who poked fun at her injured daughter including comic Jay Leno.

A bullet passed through both thighs of Lisa Simmons, 52, while on a hunt last Saturday. Her boyfriend Steven Egan, 52, fired the gun believing that a hog was rustling in the bushes.

Ms Simmons, a nurse, was taken to Dayton Beach Hospital in Florida where she remained in a serious but stable condition.

However she said she was furious that people had been making jokes about her daughter - including host Jay Leno on his late night NBC talk show.
