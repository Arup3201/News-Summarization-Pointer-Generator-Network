In an age when many have willingly surrendered all pretence of style in favour of substance, Ronny Deila offers a refreshing, intriguing take on what is important in football and what is not.

Asked yesterday if a scrappy, unconvincing performance against KR Reykjavik would be deemed irrelevant by progression via any aggregate score, the Norwegian sat up in his seat as if his ears had been assaulted by a volley of personal insults.

‘I will never say that. Never,’ he retorted. ‘If we win, I will say I am very happy with the result but I will also say if I am not happy with the performance. In the game against Krasnodar (a 3-1 win in pre-season), we were lucky. We should have lost that game but we won. Okay, that sometimes happens, but I can’t fool myself or my team.

‘We could have lost 1-0 in Iceland but that would have been unlucky because we played well and had many more chances than them. We won 1-0 and we should have won more. On Tuesday we have the chance to make that better.

‘I’m after a performance and I think we will get a good one tomorrow.’

Even without Anthony Stokes, Scott Brown and James Forrest, Deila has sound reason to believe he will cut a content figure come the close of play.

His charges were measurably superior to the Icelandic champions a week ago. The one-goal margin of victory in no way reflecting the stranglehold they had over the game.

Given the uncertainty surrounding their temporary housing at the home of Scottish Rugby, that was no bad thing. An opening night victory was verging on mandatory.

For all Deila and his players were suitably impressed with the hybrid surface they trained on last night, this remains a step into the unknown.

Yet if anyone believes this rather odd scenario of playing a home game in an alien stadium is some kind of ready-made excuse, they are sorely mistaken.

‘I haven’t been to Celtic Park, so for me this is the first home game,’ Deila added. ‘And when I went out there I wanted to play football.

‘It’s a very good pitch, brand new and a lot of people can be here as well, so I think we’ll have a good support.

‘Of course, Celtic fans are different class. They are the 12th man and I hope they come and support the team because we need it.

‘The players understand how I’m thinking now, how every training session is important, every game is important and this game is unbelievably important to get through. But it’s also important to get a performance, not just to get through and get a result.

‘We want to go out and be better than we were the last time we played because we need progression and we need to use every day to get better.

‘If we go through but have played badly then I get angry because we haven’t used the day in a good way and if you play bad you can lose as well.

‘Then we have big problems. I really want to have a good performance and if we do we will entertain the crowd and the fans and also win the game.’

Shorn of a raft of players tonight, Deila finds his squad already stretched but the misfortune of some naturally opens doors for others.

The Norwegian appears to be a fair man but an extremely demanding one. In these early days of his regime, he’s prepared to cut his players a degree of slack but his patience isn’t boundless either.

Players - such as Temmu Pukki - who haven’t previously impressed in a Celtic shirt, are being widely encouraged to now make their point. You sense they’d be well advised to take it sooner rather than later.

‘Teemu still has a future at this club,’ Deila added. ‘I come in here with an open view.

‘Everyone has the chance to make a career for themselves here. Teemu has worked hard but I want him to develop more.

‘His fitness could be better but I think he is more conscious of what he is doing on the pitch and I’m looking forward to seeing more of him.

‘It’s important for our strikers to score but I think we have been quite effective in our pre-season games. I always like to look behind the results, though, and we have deserved to lose some of those games.

‘However, that was not the case in Iceland, when we should have won by more. I think we have strikers who will score goals. It’s not a problem: we just have to feed them with chances.

‘We had a lot of big chances in Iceland and if we keep on playing like that we will score more goals.’

Tony Watt is another with some making up to do. Unable to match the mammoth expectations that followed his winning goal against Barcelona in 2012, he spent last year farmed out to Belgian side Lierse in the hope he might mature.

So has Deila already detected that change to the extent that he might involve him tonight?

‘We will see,’ he replied. ‘He has special skills and he has something extra. He can score goals - we have seen that in training. He is training well now and he looks fitter. He has had a little bit of trouble with his thigh. He is not ready for 90 minutes but he might get some minutes.’

Nonetheless, regardless of the impact such fringe players might make in the coming weeks, it seems inconceivable that Celtic would go into the group stages without further strengthening – should they get there.

The prospect of a prized asset like Virgil van Dijk or Fraser Forster also departing before August is out cannot be discounted so, provided his side do progress, the manager’s ability to work seamlessly with his club’s signing model is likely to be given a stern early test.

‘The players who are here now are the ones who are going to take us through,’ Deila added.

‘Maybe we can get two or three in, but the main players are here now. Nothing revolutionary is going to happen.

‘Yes, if we sold any of our bigger players, I would expect some of the money to be made available to me. That’s the way the club has been. If players go out, we get money to do something else.

‘It’s hard to do it right away, to go in and get your target in an hour or whatever. You have to take your time and find the right prospect. We are working hard. We have players we have identified and we will see if we can get the ones we want.’
