It had to be James Milner, didn't it?

The man who already has social media history woke up this morning to find himself, once again, the unwitting subject of sniggers around the globe when a video of him being nutmegged by Lionel Messi before awkwardly tumbling on the Nou Camp went viral.

In the stands Pep Guardiola put his hands to his face while up in the commentary box Gary Neville branded it 'barbaric'.

Milner's spoof Twitter account Boring James Milner has amassed over 389,000 followers

No matter that his team-mate Fernandinho befell the same fate moments earlier, it was funny because it was Milner.

Milner whose clean cut, straight-talking Yorkshireness spawned the spoof @boringmilner Twitter account (last count 389,000 followers).

Milner who we poke fun at because he is the antithesis of everything we say we loathe about footballers.

No drunken late nights partying, sordid kiss-and-tells or dummy-spitting rows with managers to see here. 

Unfortunately, Milner will be remembered as being the victim of Messi's genius at the Nou Camp

Dutch manager Ruud Gullit took to Twitter and added: 'OMG. Messi made Milner famous'

Bolton's on-loan midfielder Barry Bannan wrote Messi 'ain't human' after his ridiculous skills

The inference behind the giggles was loud and clear - the dour Englishman was shown up by the silky-skilled Argentinian master and he really had no right to be on the same pitch.

But who does? Not many on the planet could have lived with Messi as he waltzed and weaved through the parting sky blue seas on Wednesday night. At times it appeared as though he was playing a different sport.

Milner was not alone in being made to look foolish.

He will, however, take all of this in his stride. The latest twist in a season which, for him, has been far from boring.

Once again, he has played all over the park. Central midfield, full back, wing - when Manuel Pellegrini suffered a striker shortage he even put him up front.

And the Chilean, in a rare dropping of the guard, was quick to praise his Mr Versatile in an interview before City's 1-0 defeat.

'It would be very difficult to find a more complete player than [James] Milner,’ Pellegrini told Sportsmail. ‘There are players who are better technically. There are quicker players.

'There are players who head the ball better. But show me a player who does all the things that Milner does well and there isn’t one.'

In what could have been a testimonial dinner speech, the appreciative manager added: 'Whatever position I put him in he plays well: at full back – which is the only place he doesn’t like playing– attacking midfield, wide, or as a striker. I used him this season as a forward and the team was scoring three goals a game.

‘You leave him on the bench and he is furious, but watch him during the game, encouraging and shouting. And in the next training session he kills it for 95 minutes.

'It’s very difficult to find another Milner – an intelligent player, with big balls and a massive heart.’

Manuel Pellegrini insists that it would be difficult to find a more 'complete' player than Milner

Milner has only started 15 Premier League games, making most of his appearances from the bench

All of the above counts for nothing when the Twittersphere goes into a mean meltdown.

But it matters to others who are ready to pounce should City fail to reach an agreement to extend a deal that runs out in the summer.

At home, Liverpool and Arsenal have registered an interest.

At the turn of the year there were approaches from clubs abroad and offers of pre-contract agreements. 

None were signed because Milner, as always, wants to do the right thing and to him that is honouring the deal he signed at the Etihad Stadium.

Pellegrini is keen to get a new deal done.

But the man with big balls is playing hard ball - and he has every right to do so.
