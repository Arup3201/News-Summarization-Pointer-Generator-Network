Amir Khan fears the £200million mega-fight between Floyd Mayweather Jnr and Manny Pacquiao will be boring.

The long-awaited clash between two of the best boxers in the world is set to be announced for May 2 in Las Vegas after almost six years of failed negotiations.

But Khan is concerned that the delay means the fans will be left feeling short changed.

Amir Khan fears the mega-fight between Floyd Mayweather Jnr and Manny Pacquiao will be boring

'I think it will be a good fight for a couple of rounds,' he said. 'You never know, Mayweather might get old overnight. He's shown he's getting caught more so he's not invincible.

'Pacquiao had speed, explosiveness and power so I think he will give him a lot of problems early but I think Mayweather will just move on and drift away by picking him off with clean shots and frustrate him.

'I think it will go the distance but that Mayweather will win by unanimous decision.

'Four years ago it would have been a massive fight because both of them were at their peak. It might have gone past that now and it's not going to be what people expect.

Mayweather last fought when he beat Marcos Maidana in their rematch last September

'It could be a boring fight if both of them try to box each other. Some people have such high hopes for the fight but it could be boring.

'I don't think Manny would try to make it boring but Mayweather would. Four or five years ago it would have been a bigger fight than it is now, it won't be as exciting.'

Khan had hoped to face either man himself this year but must now look elsewhere.

The Bolton welterweight still plans to fight in May and hopes to finalise an opponent in the next week.

Pacquiao was last in action when he dominated Chris Algieri over 12 rounds in Macau last November

But he remains convinced he would pose a tougher test for Mayweather than Pacquiao.

'I really believe I have the style to give Mayweather the biggest problems,' he added. 'Pacquiao is good and it's a fight people want to see but the style I have would give him more problems.

'I'm long, I'm tall and I've got that range, speed and power, everything Mayweather hates.

'The top boxers in the world from Sugar Ray Leonard to Tommy Hearns and Marvin Hagler have said Amir Khan is the only guy can who can beat Mayweather.'
