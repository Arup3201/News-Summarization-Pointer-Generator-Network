Law enforcement officials in Maryland are on the hunt for a murder suspect who was released by mistake from jail while waiting to go on trial.

Rodriquez Purnell, 30, was erroneously freed Friday from the Maryland Reception, Diagnostic and Classification Center in Baltimore, and he has not been seen since.

Purnell was awaiting trial in the shooting death of 27-year-old Terrance J Rheubottom on St. Patrick's Day 2013 in Baltimore. He also had been convicted of assaulting a corrections worker.

Corrections officials did not release details of how Purnell was released but said they did not realize their error until they got a tip Sunday night from the victim's family, who said that friends had spotted the murder suspect in his old neighborhood. 

Del. John Cluster, a Baltimore County Republican and former police officer, on Tuesday questioned why corrections officials didn't realize Purnell had been freed earlier, noting that prison protocol is to conduct a nightly head count of all inmates. 

‘If this is done nightly, how could such a dangerous person not come up missing immediately?’ Cluster said. 

The Maryland Department of Public Safety and Corrections acknowledged in a statement Tuesday afternoon that a breach in protocol led to the accidental release.

Victim: Purnell is accused of shooting dead TJ Rheubottom, a father of two, in March 2013 

According to corrections officials, staff members are required to perform multiple checks on inmates before they are released. In Purnell’s case, he was let go because procedures were not followed.

The department said it would conduct its own investigation into the matter. For now, an employee linked to the protocol breach has been placed on paid administrative leave.  

But Cluster said the Maryland State Police should investigate how Purnell came to be freed and determine if criminal charges are appropriate, including against administrative officials. 

He said the prison costs about $39million in taxpayer money to run every year, and that since it's under control of the state, the state is responsible for anything Purnell might do while he's out of prison. 

Purnell is accused of shooting dead Terrence Jerome Rheubottom, a father of two, inside a car on Ruxton Avenue in Baltimore on March 17, 2013.

Jacqueline Davis, Rheubottom's mother, said that whoever is responsible for Purnell's release needs to be fired and that Purnell needs to be found. 

‘I just want him back in custody,’ she said. ‘I want to see him convicted and behind bars.’

Speaking to the station WBAL-TV, Mrs Davis expressed concern for the safety of her family, as well as for people whom may have witnessed her son's slaying.  

'He could be anywhere out there, calling the witnesses, trying to intimidate them,' she said. 

TJ Rheubottom's mother pleaded for Purnell to turn himself in.  

Purnell's trial is scheduled to get under way November 19. He is described as a black male, 6 feet tall and weighing 175lbs, with black hair and brown eyes.
