Snip: Dr Paul Perito has been accused of botching penis operation

A Miami urologist has been accused of mangling a patient's penis so badly it had to be amputated - and it is not the first time.

Dr Paul Perito, 50, is once again facing a lawsuit after amputating a man's penis following a series of botched operations. 

The physician is already fighting an ongoing lawsuit by another patient who also claims to have lost his penis at the doctor's hands.

The father has in the past also been charged with organised fraud and racketeering linked to PlayPen strip club in which he was a partner, reports the Miami New Times.

The latest lawsuit comes from a man, known only as Hank, who was in jail for drink-driving when he developed blisters on his penis three years ago.

This led to a series of botched operations, resulting in him having his penis amputated, according to the New Times.

The doctor who he says is most responsible for robbing him of his manhood is Dr Perito.

The 51-year-old Floridan has filed a lawsuit against the Florida Department of Corrections (DOC) and six doctors, including Perito.

After four penis surgeries with increasingly catastrophic results. Hank had to undergo a 'partial penectomy'.

'When I woke up, I had a hose run up inside me, and everything else was 
cut off — completely amputated,' Hank told the New Times close to tears.

Perito has denied any negligence in Hank's treatment, blaming the patient's 'actions or omissions', reports the New Times.

Hank had spent two years at the Okeechobee Correctional Institution when he developed the blisters and was sent to South Miami's Larkin Community Hospital, where Perito examined him in June 2009.

Hank told the New Times that the urologist 'debrided' the organ - stripping it of contaminated tissue - and then packed it with gauze and stitched it up.

He attached three strings to pull the 
packing out, like a tampon, within five days, reports the New Times.

In an apparent bid by the DOC to cut
 costs, Hank was sent from Larkin to Kendall Regional Medical Center where he claims doctors were confused by Perito's method and were unable to reach him.

The gauze was not removed and it was not until nearly three weeks 
later, on July 17, after Hank's penis  became infected a Kendall urologist treated him for gangrene.

Within the next three weeks, Hank endured two more operations.

On August 14,
 Perito finally inspected what was left of his handiwork, and three days later Hank had the amputation.

Asked by the New Times if he still experiences sexual urges, Hank breaks down.

'Sometimes I have dreams. But I'm in 
so much pain, sex is the last thing on my mind. I don't think they have 
enough money to pay me for what they've done to me.

'They can never replace it. They can't give me a rubber leg. I don't know what they'd put there.'

Botched: The man developed blisters and was sent to South Miami's Larkin Community Hospital, where Perito examined him in June 2009

Perito, who was first licensed in 
Florida in 1994, runs a private practice - Perito Urology -  providing 
of penile implants, which keep his patients permanently erect. 

In August 2007, he performed an allegedly botched penile implant operation on Enrique Millas, reports the New Times.

The 62-year-old man's penis became gangrenous, so the doctor removed most of it.

Millas sued Perito two years later claiming the
 complications arose from his diabetes, which the doctor should have 
foreseen, however Perito claims they were caused by Millas not following
 advice and having sex 
too soon.

Accused: Perito faced charges related to the alleged sale of diluted or counterfeit prescription drugs from his Goulds strip club, Playpen South

In 2004 Perito faced dozens of counts involving the illegal sale of prescription drugs under federal RICO racketeering statutes, according to the report. 

But he entered a pretrial diversion program for only one minor charge: illegal possession of prescription drugs: he was ordered to have counseling, pay almost $3,000 costs and a $15,000 fine to keep his license, reports the New Times.

Hank, who was released from  prison in March 2010, has also filed a suit against Larkin Hospital, and doctors  Carpio, Haridas Bhadja, Robert Hernandez, Pedro Kiliddjian, and Michael Mirander, who all deny negligence.

The lawsuit claims Perito 'breached his duty of care... resulting in pain, disability, disfigurement, and mental anguish.' reports the New Times.
