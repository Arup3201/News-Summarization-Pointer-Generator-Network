Stephen Ireland has accused Aston Villa of treating him 'like a toy' and making him train alone in a field. 

The 27-year-old spent four years at Villa before moving on loan to Stoke last September before making his move permanent in January.

The midfielder has become a vital part of Mark Hughes' side and is looking forward to proving his critics wrong when Stoke host Villa on Saturday.

Making his mark: Stephen Ireland is determined to prove his critics wrong

'Villa took the p***. They treated me like a toy. I was cast on on one side,' Ireland told the Daily Star. 'They even took me to a field on my own to train. It was an absolute nightmare. 

'There was just me and the fitness coach in a field. He used to take me three or four pitches away from the main group. He would warm-up the first-team, run me around for 30 minutes and then leave to go home.

'I don't feel I was given the chances. It's difficult not to feel hard done by. I can't do anything about the past. All I can do is influence the future and that's what I'm planning to do.'

Ireland also revealed how he was being paid just £85 a week during his spell at Manchester City. 

He added: 'I played three years in the Premier League and I was still on £85 a week. I had a baby son. I never drove until I was 23 years old. You wouldn't believe it now, looking at City. Now I see players there making five appearances who are on £50,000 a week.'
