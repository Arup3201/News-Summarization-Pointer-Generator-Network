The stunning home of former NSW Premier Nick Greiner and his ex-wife Kathryn has opened its doors to buyers after the couple announced the end of their marriage. 

The five-bedroom property in Centennial Park, Sydney, which is immaculately presented throughout and boasts a beautiful outdoor swimming pool, will go under the hammer on October 27 with a guide price of around $6 million.

The home, which is spread across three floors, sits in a prime location and it is understood the house has attracted a few offers in the last few months which were deemed unacceptable to both parties.

Nick and Kathryn Greiner publically ended their 43 year marriage last October revealing that they had been living separate lives 

The house, which is spread across three floors, boasts pruned and neat gardens for the new owners 

The couple hope to sell the Lang Road home for at least $6 million at the public auction on October 27

The views from the home over Centennial Park and the rest of Sydney are quite spectacular 

The house sits on a plot of 822 square metres and the couple purchased the house in 2002 for $4 million from car dealer Paul Warren who moved down the road, reports Property Observer.

The former NSW premier and his wife, who was the former Liberal-aligned City of Sydney councillor, publicly ended their marriage in October last year after 43 years of marriage. 

The couple issued a statement saying that they had been leading increasingly separate lives. 

The couple purchased the home in 2002 for $4 million and decorated the house to a very high standard for their family to enjoy 

The park-side home has lots of space and is decorated with neutral colours to make the most of the natural light eliminating the living area 

The clean and bright open-plan kitchen and dining area is perfect for entertaining guests

The statement at the time said: 'Nick and Kathryn Greiner have agreed to separate. After a great deal of thought they have decided to lead individual lives.'

'The decision is mutual and amicable. They remain good friends and are completely devoted to their family. They will not be making any further comment.'

The breakdown of the couple's marriage followed a tough time for Budapest-born businessman Mr Greiner, who was the 37th Premier of NSW, after he stepped down from being the chairman of Barry O'Farrell's government advisory body Infrastructure NSW in July last year. 

The couple also split in 1966 when the businessman and politician admitted to having an affair but they later got back together. 

Mr and Mrs Greiner have two children together, Justin and Kara, and they told at the time how they reconnected for the sake of their children.

The home is being marketed by James McCowan at Sotheby's International and Craig Pontey from Ray White Double Bay. 

With the house having five large bedrooms the new owners will never be short of space

This large bathroom has a centre piece bathtub and his and hers sinks at each side so everyone has enough space

Every one of the rooms of the house is large and airy with lots of windows to make the most of the greenery and park location

The bright hallway is a great selling point for this home which will give the new owners space and flexibility 

This perfectly placed balcony allows the owners to take in the lovely scenery and place where the house is located
