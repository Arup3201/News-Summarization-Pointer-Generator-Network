Did SHE or didn’t she? Will she or won’t she? Has she or hasn’t she? And most pertinent of all, most damnably crucial of all, is she or is she not guilty?

On Wednesday night, as the last episode in the second series of BBC2’s police corruption drama Line Of Duty is shown, millions of  television viewers will finally find out the truth about the mysterious Detective Inspector Lindsay Denton. 

Is the beleaguered cop, so brilliantly played by Keeley Hawes, really a force for good; an honourable and decent woman trying to do her best in a quagmire of police corruption?

Or is she just another crazy bunny boiler seeking revenge on the senior officer with whom she had an affair? 

The question has certainly set the deerstalkers a-twirling on the heads of the armchair Sherlocks at home, desperately trying to work out Denton’s innocence — or otherwise.

And after five 60-minute episodes of the most tightly-plotted and nerve-shredding drama seen on British television in years, we still don’t have a clue.

As the bodies continue to pile up, Line Of Duty has been the most talked-about cop show since last year’s Broadchurch on ITV (the story of a child killed in a Dorset seaside town) — and no wonder.

Television critics and fans alike are showering Line Of Duty with praise, most describing it as the best television series of the year so far, some even calling it the best police drama ever made.

Certainly, this taut, nasty, unpredictable whodunit proves that the BBC — when it puts its mind to it — can make big, powerful, smash-hit dramas that are just as good as anything produced by American companies, with their limitless budgets, resources and deployment of Hollywood talent.

Written by Jed Mercurio (his previous work includes medical drama Cardiac Arrest) and blessed with a flawless cast, the show has lured viewers into a world of police-on-police murder which is often genuinely shocking, quietly horrifying and deeply thought-provoking.

Corpses have their fingerprints burned off to avoid identification, while rivalries between police departments in the same force threaten to bury justice in a welter of internecine politicking. 

Filmed in Belfast last year, Line Of Duty is set within a fictitious English force, but Mercurio used (anonymous) serving police officers as consultants.

The result is an authentic atmosphere and a series which depicts the complicated realities of modern police work with an unflinching eye.

At a time when the real-life Metropolitan Police are once more under fire and facing allegations of rogue operations and corruption (in the investigation into the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence and others), here is a cop show not afraid to sizzle with intelligence and the unmistakeable imprimatur of red hot realism. 

It reflects a world in which the dividing line between righteousness and evil, between the goodies and the baddies, has never been so mutable. 

Twenty-five years after the Hillsborough disaster, questions about police conduct and the subsequent cover-up of events on that day are still being asked.

And then there was so-called Plebgate, after which it emerged that a serving officer lied about an altercation with the Government Chief Whip at the gates of Downing Street.

The moral ambiguity of the force and the question of who can and who cannot be trusted, in or out of uniform, has never been more pertinent.

Over the past five tension-ratcheting weeks, DI Denton has been the prime suspect in an intricate web of crime.

The central mystery is who plotted an ambush on a police convoy, killing the protected witness they were transporting to safety and the three officers accompanying him. 

Since then, there have been two more police deaths; one detective was thrown through the window of a hospital, another was battered with a monkey wrench.

Linked to all this is the murder of a teenage runaway and the fact that Denton once had an affair with the big boss, Assistant Chief Constable Mike Dryden (played by Mark Bonnar who is also superb, with very emotive nostrils). 

So far, so very, very bleak. As the quest for justice lurches on, piano-playing Denton has been arrested on suspicion of murder and while in prison, had her hands crushed and then scalded with boiling water.

She has also had her head shoved down a toilet (by the cops in her own station) and had excrement smuggled into her prison porridge.

Hardly a glamorous role for 38-year-old Hawes, known for her natural gloss and polished performances in series such as Spooks and Ashes To Ashes.

Here, she is dowdy to the point of despair; a woman who cuts her own fringe, wears yesterday’s mascara and throws on clothes that appear to be made of cast-off potato sacks. 

It goes without saying that she is a peerless detective, possessed of ratlike cunning and strong survival instincts.

Indeed, not since Helen Mirren first played DCI Jane Tennison back in Prime Suspect in the early Nineties has such a fascinating and complex female police officer been created for television.

Yes, Broadchurch had the wonderful DS Ellie Miller (Olivia Colman), while Scott & Bailey continue to ply their trade on ITV.

In recent years, however, it is Scandinavian dramas which have led the way in creating iconoclastic, mould-breaking policewomen such as Sarah Lund and her woolly jumpers in The Killing and the alarmingly direct Saga Noren in The Bridge.

Now it is DI Denton, beaten up but not beaten, who is more than a match for all these top she-cops.

With only the tiniest emotion occasionally washing across her bare face, she gives nothing away.

Behind the thin blue line, who is guilty and who is innocent?

As internet chat-rooms boil with speculation and more than three million BBC viewers have their own theories, it is interesting that no Line Of Duty character, within the anti-corruption squad or out of it, is wholly good or bad.

Each and every officer is tainted in some way, although some are more crippled by their flaws than others.

DI Denton has money worries, a difficult past and a tendency towards violence.

Miss Marple she is not. ‘People have underestimated me my whole life,’ she tells DC Kate Fleming (Vicky McClure) before punching her in the stomach.

Fleming was having an affair with the husband of the policewoman killed in the ambush, a fact known to colleague DS Steve Arnott (Martin Compston) who sleeps with every attractive female in sight. 

Superintendent Ted Hastings (Adrian Dunbar) also has money worries and a broken marriage.

Promised a promotion by Dryden, he has been reluctant to explore avenues in the investigation that might clear Denton and implicate his protector within the force. 

Viewers have lapped up all this moral ambiguity — not to mention the excellent writing, terrific acting and a complicated plotline that does not treat them like idiots. 

Last week, the questioning under caution of Dryden by anti-corruption officers Arnott and Fleming went on for nearly 18 minutes of heart-stopping drama.

Cocky and threatening at first, Dryden’s nostrils went into terrifying overdrive as the evidence mounted up.

Out on bail and back in her empty flat, the faintest spectre of a smirk flitted across Denton’s face as she watched a report of Dryden’s arrest on the news.

Earlier she had forced a confession out of a detective by crushing him against a wall with a car.

Bunny boiler or brilliant bobby? We’ll have to wait until Wednesday to find out.
