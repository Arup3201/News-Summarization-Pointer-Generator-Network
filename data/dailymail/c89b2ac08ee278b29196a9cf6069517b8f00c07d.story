If Jose Mourinho's Chelsea side do race away with this season's Premier League title, the acquisitions of Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas will no doubt be looked upon as the main components to a successful campaign.

Such flair and creativity from the Chelsea attack, however, would not be able to flourish without the solid blue wall that consists of Branislav Ivanovic, Gary Cahill, John Terry and Cesar Azpilicueta.

This season has seen a more expansive Chelsea than fans are used to under Mourinho with the likes of Eden Hazard and Fabregas supplying the ammo for £32million man Costa, who already has nine Premier League goals to his name.

Although Southampton sit top of the fewest goals conceded charts, letting in just five so far, Chelsea's back line is one that breeds confidence and looks ready for any kind of battle they may face together.

Chelsea's back four would have played in every minute of Chelsea's 10 Premier League games so far this season had in not been for Azpilicueta's three-game ban following his red card against Crystal Palace last month and it's no coincidence that this consistency is giving the team a superb platform to build from. 

The difference between the league leaders and their rivals this season is the fact that they have four warriors at the back. Manchester City can always rely on captain Vincent Kompany, Arsenal fans will tell you Per Mertesacker is the man, while Manchester United are calling out for a defender of Terry's caliber following the departure of Nemanja Vidic.

Terry has 75 per cent of his tackled during his 900 minutes of Premier League football

In his 2014-15 defence, Mourinho has a four-piece that have been playing together for the best part of two years and their qualities lend themselves perfectly to the Portuguese manager's desire to see his team defend properly.

It's no surprise that Mourinho was quick to get rid of flamboyant defender David Luiz last summer, he was always going to be too unpredictable to nail down a starting place in the Premier League.

Filipe Luis, a huge part of Atletico Madrid's impressive defence last season, can't get a look in despite costing the club £16m and despite Azpilicueta not actually being left-footed.

Sky Sports pundit Gary Neville recently claimed Azpilicueta is as 'near to perfect as possible when it comes to defending.'

He was right - a quick glance at the Spaniard's stats so far this season show that Azpilicueta has won 91.7 per cent of his tackles while making 17 interceptions in his eight appearances for the Stamford Bridge club.

When asked who he though was the best defender is the Premier League, Neville said: 'I’d say, for consistency of performances, it would be one of the Chelsea lads – and I’d probably say Azpilicueta.

Nemanja Matic acts as the spoiler in Chelsea's well-drilled midfield unit to have impressed so much

'For technical defending, not making a mistake, not being in the wrong position, not getting caught out… I don’t see him making a mistake.'

On the opposing flank, Chelsea have a monster of a defender in Ivanovic who rarely gets beaten in a show of strength or even speed. After a pre-season without World Cup football, the Serbia captain hit the ground running and nailed down his right back position just when it looked as though he'd be the man to drop out of Mourinho's starting XI this term.

The centre back pairing of Cahill and Terry continues to be the best defensive partnership in the domestic league by some distance. Although Cahill can at times look slightly out of sorts without Terry at his side, the England vice-captain has improved ten-fold since his move from Bolton in 2012.

At the tender age of 33, Terry still seems to bring the best out of the players around him while still performing at a level most Premier League centre halves can only admire.

The Chelsea skipper continues to flourish in the absence of international football and his experience will be vital to the west London club's title push.

Jose Mourinho has seen his side concede late goals at the Etihad, Old Trafford and Selhurst Park this season

The Blues defence may be impressive, but Mourinho will still be frustrated with the fact that his side have kept just three clean sheets so far this season - there is room for improvement.

The 50-year-old boss has seen his side concede late goals at the Etihad, Old Trafford and Selhurst Park this season which is something Mourinho will be looking to cut out.

Despite that fact, Mourinho can take confidence from watching his rivals struggle to field the same back four each weekend. 

United's defence has lost the likes Vidic and Patrice Evra while being plagued with injuries, Manuel Pellegrini seems to have a desire to rotate his City full backs and is having to allow Eliaquim Mangala time to adapt while title contenders Liverpool and Arsenal struggle to keep pace after a poor summer transfer window.
