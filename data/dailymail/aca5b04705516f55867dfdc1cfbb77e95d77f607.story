The freezing weather has only just come to an end, but already Britons are worrying about the figure they’ll cut on the beach.

Today is the day women are most likely to start their summer bikini diet, according to a study.

On average, women want to lose 11lb, with more than one in four inspired to fight winter flab by bikini pictures of celebrities such as Myleene Klass, Kelly Brook and Denise van Outen.

The poll of 2,000 men and women by supermarket Asda found more than four out of five women (82 per cent) aim to slim down by summer.

But it’s a different story for men, with fewer than one in five hoping to lose weight.

More than half, or 56 per cent, of women have a weight loss goal of 11lb and, with 13 weeks until school summer holidays, starting today gives them a manageable target of losing just under 1lb a week.

More than a quarter of women polled said seeing celebrity bodies gave them the incentive to diet.

And 15 per cent even admitted to decorating their fridge with celeb ‘thinspiration’ pictures.

Sales of pre-packed salads are up 50 per cent as the nation swaps stodgy winter warmers for light alternatives, and Galia melons are the top diet-friendly snack, with sales up 80 per cent.

Women in their thirties are most likely to start a diet today and plan to lose weight sensibly with healthy eating and exercise.

Meanwhile, those in their twenties confessed to crash dieting and using ‘fad’ weight loss plans in a last minute bid to shape up.

Of men who wanted to lose weight, nearly two-thirds said they wouldn’t be changing their habits until a month before their holiday.
