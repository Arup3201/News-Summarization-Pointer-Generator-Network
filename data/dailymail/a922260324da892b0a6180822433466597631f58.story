Two smiling children peer out from the top floor of a house with no windows or doors - or any furniture for that matter.

Meanwhile, fellow day trippers stroll down a path unfazed by a nearby sign which reads, 'Danger. Unexploded military debris. Do not leave the carriageway.'

These peculiar images give an insight into a real-world ghost town which has been deserted for almost 70 years.

Welcome to Imber, Wiltshire. Population: just soldiers... except on the Easter Bank Holiday weekend, when it is open to the general public.

While Imber has no electricity or running water, the village's Grade I-listed 13th century church is in full-working order

The locals were evacuated in December 1943 during World War II and never allowed to return.

Now, the abandoned village, on Salisbury Plain, is used as a training site for the Ministry of Defence.

But it was opened to the public over the Easter Bank Holiday weekend with dozens of intrigued locals visiting the uninhabited village.

The village's pub, manor house and cottages have become derelict shells over the past 70 years.

Villagers were given just 47 days' notice on November 1, 1943 to leave Imber, which was used as an exercise area for US troops preparing for the D-Day landings

Despite some villagers being upset at having to leave, many showed no resistance, seeing it as their duty to contribute to the war effort

St Giles Church, which comes under the Diocese of Salisbury, underwent a £300,000 restoration in 2008 as part of a national project by the Churches Conservation Trust

By the time of the Second World War, the government owned almost all of the land in and around the village

Imber also contains four council house style blocks which were built in 1938.

In 1943, there was also a Baptist Chapel which was demolished in the late 1970s.

The government began buying land on Salisbury Plain in the late 19th century to use it for manoeuvres.

But in the 1920s, farms around Imber began to be purchased as well as the village's land.

By the time of the Second World War, the government owned almost all of the land in and around the village.

Following the war, the village was still used for training soldiers - especially those who were serving in Northern Ireland.

In the 1970s, a number of distinctive-looking houses were built to aid the training.
