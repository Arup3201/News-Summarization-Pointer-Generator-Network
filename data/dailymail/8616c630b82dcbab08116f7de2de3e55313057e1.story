New mom Savannah Guthrie returned to the Today show on Monday 12 weeks after giving birth to daughter Vale. 

The 42-year-old anchor was welcomed back in the New York studio by colleagues Matt Lauer, Al Roker and Natalie Morales after having her first baby on August 13. 

She said: 'It's so great to be back to see all of our friends here behind the scenes' adding that if too many clips of her daughter were shown 'you may have some waterworks'.

In a first-person essay about her experiences as a new mom returning to work after maternity leave, she wrote: 'I feel like my heart is outside my body because Vale is in this world and she's my heart.'

Guthrie, who looked trim in a matching vibrant pink skirt and peplum top, tweeted from her desk on Monday: 'How to get through first morning post maternity leave? FaceTime during commercials.' 

On Sunday night she also posted a picture of her 3am alarm clock with the words: 'Haven't done this in a while.' 

Guthrie had joined her colleagues briefly on Friday for the Today Halloween special. As part of the Saturday Night Live theme, she dressed up as one of the ladies from the Mom's Jeans commercial, made famous by Amy Poehler and Tina Fey, along with presenters Jenna Bush Hager and Meredith Vieira. 

Baby Vale made her TV debut at the end of September. Guthrie and her husband Mike Feldman, 45, proudly appeared  to show her off.

The presenter wrote a first-person piece for Today where she described how life is different now that she will be a working mom. 

She wrote: 'I feel basically like myself, but hopefully a little bit better. Softer. More patient. Kinder. Gentler.' 

Guthrie, 42, said that she had 'checked out' during her time on maternity leave with her baby daughter and just focused entirely on caring for her

The crowds in Rockefeller Plaza welcomed the presenter back after 12 weeks of maternity leave on Monday

She said that maternity leave felt like a luxury after hardly taking two weeks off during her entire working life.

The best part was having days stretch out with nothing more to do than take care of her new baby, she wrote. 

However she admitted that having a new baby waking up every few hours is exhausting. 

She wrote: 'I find that sleep deprivation kind of accumulates and after a while you're just not quite yourself. So of course one of the things is I'm terrified to come back to a job where I have to speak for a living, because I honestly have a very hard time right now putting basic sentences together.'

Along with 'mommy brain' getting back into her pre-birth pants had been a challenge, she admitted.

The Today host also shared baby snaps of herself alongside her new daughter for her return to the breakfast show 

'The first time I tried to put on my old jeans it was not funny,' Guthrie wrote. 'It took, like, a crowbar to close the buttons and I was doing the splits trying to stretch 'em out and they still don't really fit.' 

She added: 'So forgive my rolls.' 

Other moms had advice for the first-time working mom including friend and co-host Natalie Morales. 

Savannah and husband Mike kept a video diary which began on their way to the hospital for the birth of baby Vale in August 

Savannah became overwhelmed with the emotion of the day as she prepared to give birth to her baby 

The TV presenter said today that she felt like she was leaving her heart outside of her body by going back to work and leaving baby Vale at home 

In an essay at Today.com, she wrote: 'You have new priorities and everyone expects that now. Don't be afraid to say "no" more often so that you can spend any free moment with Vale. Take the transition slowly and don't feel like you have to be everything to everyone right away. Take time for you, too!'

Guthrie and husband Mike Feldman welcomed Vale, weighing 8.5lb and measuring 19.5inches, in the early hours of August 13.

'[Vale] has blue eyes, a little bit of blondish hair and the chubbiest cheeks you’ve ever seen,' Ms Guthrie told Today shortly after Vale's birth. 

'I think we found heaven in this little hospital room in New York City.'  

Mr Feldman, 45, was by Savannah's side when she gave birth. The political consultant and the TV presenter married on March 15 this year in Tucson, Arizona. They announced at their wedding reception that Savannah was pregnant with her first child
