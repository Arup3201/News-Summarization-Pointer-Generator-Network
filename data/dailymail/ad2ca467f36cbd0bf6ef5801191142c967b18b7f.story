A super-fit amputee came first in the fancy dress section of a modelling contest by dressing up as a peg-legged pirate.

Jonas Zimicki, 31, from Cambridge, has now been offered a string of modelling jobs after placing fourth overall in the Miami Pro UK Championships.

The gym instructor, who has no right leg, had hoped to compete as a sprinter for Team GB in last year's Paralympic Games. But after he failed to make the cut he switched his focus to fitness modelling in the hope he could offer an example to other disabled people.

His efforts were rewarded when he was crowned fitness modelling fancy dress champ at his first attempt, complete with wooden leg.

Lithuanian-born Mr Zimicki was born with a deformed right leg which surgeon's amputated when he was 19.

He moved to Britain in 2004 and wanted to compete for his adopted country after training alongside Jonny Peacock.

But he missed out on a place with Team GB and instead had to watch from his sofa.

'I took up fitness modelling off the back of devastating disappointment when I failed to make team GB at the Paralympics last year,' he said.

'I had been training with Jonny Peacock at Lea Valley in the 100 metre sprint throughout 2011 and 2012 but wasn't successful. I didn't know what to do next.'

Determined: Mr Zimicki, a gym instructor who is originally from Lithuania, took up fitness modelling after missing out on a place to represent Britain as a sprinter at the Paralympic Games in London last year

He started work as a gym instructor in Cambridge and visited schools in the city to lend children tips and advice on how to keep fit.

A colleague then encouraged him to train for fitness modelling and gave him tips on nutrition and exercises.

He entered the under 75kg category in the Miami Pro UK Championships and finished fourth out of more than 40 competitors overall.

He said: 'What I did is fitness modelling rather than body building as it focuses very much on looking healthy and feeling healthy.

'I really enjoyed it. I didn't know how the audience and other competitors would react to me but they were all really supportive and the comments were great.

'I've been approached by magazines and agencies who have never met an amputee doing what I am doing.

'It is really positive for me both as a person and as a businessman.

'I don't want to tell other people with similar issues like mine what to do with their lives, but I can go out and do something and hopefully that can provide some sort of inspiration.'
