A recent survey has revealed that more than a third of Brits take four or fewer baths a year — preferring instead to opt for the convenience of a shower.

More fool them, I say. I’m part of the Tom Ford school of thinking — the fashion designer has been reported to take up to five baths a day, revering them for their ‘meditative’ properties. And he’s right. When it comes to relaxation, nothing beats a long, hot soak.

These days, you can make your bath even more self-indulgent with gadgets that let you lounge in the tub while watching films, reading books or listening to music. And some of them will even run the water for you.

I slipped beneath the suds to try them out . . .

RELAX INTO PILLOW PERFECTION

The Savoy Bath Pillow

Lounge in utmost comfort with a bath pillow from one of the world’s swankiest hotels — The Savoy Bath Pillow (£15, Savoy Tea Shop).

While a night at The Savoy will cost you the best part of £400, one of their bath pillows — described to me by one travel editor as ‘the best I’ve found anywhere, ever’ — can be yours for a fraction of the cost.

Unlike its cheaper cousins, this luxurious pillow is not inflatable or square. Instead, it’s a foam cylinder, covered in spa-style waffle cotton, which can be removed for washing.

Two suction cups on a flap of fabric hold it firmly against the bath, and the cylinder sits at the nape of your neck, cradling you gently as you drift off. Pure bathing bliss.

KEEP A GLASS OF WINE SAFE

Bosign Suction Wine Glass Holder

Relaxing with a glass of red by candlelight sounds like a dream — until you knock it onto the floor or into the bath.

To avoid such mishaps, look for holders, such as the Bosign Suction Wine Glass Holder (£6.95, homearama.co.uk), a sleek, stainless-steel design that works best on a perpendicular bath side. They also do a tealight holder (£6.45).

For an all-in-one solution that will hold not only a glass of wine and a candle, but also a book, check out the Bathroom Bath Tub Caddy with Wine, Candle and Book Holder (£14.99, amazon.co.uk). It may look a little twee, but it does the job so well, you’re unlikely to care.

Extending handles mean that it will fit over any bath up to 90 cm wide (a standard bath is 70 cm) and the candle holder, book stand and wine glass holders are all detachable.

LIGHT UP YOUR LATHER

Colour Changing Spa Lights

If candles don’t light your fire, there’s a wealth of other lighting options to try out at bathtime.

Colour Changing Spa Lights (£6.95, prezzybox.com) are fully submersible and come with a suction cup, which means they can stick to the sides and the base of the bath. They change colour gradually and will even float on the surface.

For a real Saturday Night Fever effect, try the Underwater Disco Lightshow (£7.99, firebox.com), a floating gadget that projects multicoloured patterns of light around your bathroom — rather like a watery mirrorball. It sounds bonkers but, with the lights off, it’s truly mesmerising.

HAVE A RAVE WHILE YOU BATHE

The Mini Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker

If you enjoy being lulled by Handel’s Water Music while you bathe, then a waterproof speaker is a must. The best solution is a Bluetooth speaker that connects wirelessly to your computer, tablet or smartphone, meaning your pricey gadgets can stay safe and dry outside the bathroom, while you listen to your music inside.

The Mini Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker (£6.15, amazon.co.uk) has a suction cup attached, so you can stick it to tiles. It doesn’t offer the best quality sound — what do you expect at that price? — and for best results, you need to turn the volume right up on the source device, then adjust on the speaker.

But it’s rechargeable and does everything that you need it to, including skipping tracks.

You can even use it to answer your phone. That is if you don’t mind your bath being disturbed. For a better sound experience, though at a significantly elevated price, try the rechargeable waterproof Ultimate Ears Megaboom Speaker (£249.95, amazon.co.uk). Only about the size of two stacked tin cans, it produces seriously impressive sound.

And if you really love your music, you might consider an upgrade to the Kaldewei Soundwave Sound System (£396.25, ukbathrooms.com), which turns your whole bath into a speaker that wirelessly connects to the music source using Bluetooth.

The sounds aren’t just audible, they can actually be felt as vibrations through the water — fine if you’re listening to waves or whales, though less relaxing if you have a penchant for heavy metal!

WATERPROOF YOUR IPAD

LifeProof’s nuud iPad case

Back in the old days, reading a book or magazine in the bath was the ultimate escape — until, of course, you dropped it in the water and had to leave it splayed on a radiator to dry.

Now that an estimated two in five of us own a tablet or eReader, the ramifications of dropping your novel in the bath have become a little more significant.

So, although the Kobo Aura H2O eReader (£139.95, johnlewis.com) is £60 more than the basic model and around £80 more than the cheapest Kindle, it might be a worthwhile investment, because it’s waterproof for up to 30 minutes.

If you’d rather watch television in the bath, you could either splash out on a Hafele Waterproof TV (from £470, hafele.co.uk) or invest in a waterproof case and stream films or TV through your tablet.

LifeProof’s nuud iPad case (£89.95, apple.com) does the job, but comes at a price.

If you’re just planning on leaving your device on the side, then a water-resistant one (which is splash-proof, but not submersible), such as the Griffin Survivor Case (from £19.99, amazon.co.uk), which comes with its own stand, will do.

An even cheaper option is a Go Travel Waterproof Case (from £5.09, amazon.co.uk) — effectively a heavy-duty plastic bag, which uses a Velcro closure to keep the water away from your gadget if it accidentally gets dunked.

... AND THE BATH CAN EVEN RUN ITSELF!

Crosswater Digital

If you dream of having a butler to draw a bath for you, then this gadget could make all of your Downton Abbey fantasies come true.

Crosswater Digital (from £499, crosswater.co.uk) is a seriously high-tech bath system that lets you take control of your bath or shower from an app on your smartphone.

You can dial in the temperature and depth you want — and even store up to three presets, just in case you prefer a hotter or deeper bath than your partner.

You’ll need to be on the same wifi network (so you can’t start running the bath when you’re on the train on the way home), but it can be used from anywhere in the house.

And if you’ve got the additional electronic plug system, you can even drain the bath using the app, too.

Unfortunately, the one thing it won’t do is to clean the bath for you!
