September 21st? Rumours are suggesting an earlier than anticipated launch for Apple's iPhone 5

The new iPhone will have an even thinner screen thanks to advances in LCD manufacturing, according to reports.

The latest Apple gadget will feature ‘in-cell technology’ which has touch sensors in the screen instead of another layer on top as it is now.

The difference would make the new iPhone about half a millimeter thinner but the image quality would actually improve, the Wall St Journal claimed.

It would also allow Apple to better take on Samsung’s Galaxy S III which has organic light-emitting displays which do not need to be backlit and are thinner than iPhone screens.

Samsung has been touting the feature as a major selling point to persuade customers to make the switch.

The iPhone 4 is 9.3mm deep compared to 8.6mm for the Galaxy S III.

Apple’s liquid crystal makers Sharp, Japan Display Inc and LG Display are said to be making hundreds of thousands of panels that will be used in the new iPhone, possibly the 5th version.

A thinner screen would make the device more attractive but would also make extra room for more components or features.

It could also allow more space for the battery which could extend the life of the iPhone, a constant complaint amongst users.

According to the Wall St Journal 
however ‘LCD makers are finding the manufacturing process challenging 
and time-consuming’ as they try and find the right balance.

There
 is mounting speculation that the new iPhone will have a screen that is 
larger than the current iPhone’s 3.5 inch display, even though the 
company’s late founder Steve Jobs rejected such an idea.

It's coming! 9to5Mac has released this image, purported to be the iPhone 5. Features that can be spotted include a much larger screen, and a smaller dock connector

A thinner screen could offset the additional weight and keep it portable enough to compete against Samsung.

Former
 Apple manager Leslie Grandy was recently quoted as saying a larger 
iPhone - or smaller iPad - could be ‘appealing to people who do not now 
carry their iPads with them because they are too large and heavy’.

She added a seven inch device is too big for a pocket but just the right size for a woman’s handbag.
