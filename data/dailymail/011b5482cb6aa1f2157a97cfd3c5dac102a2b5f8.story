The last fortnight has seen the biggest names in fashion, music and film traverse the globe to attend some of Tinseltown's most glamorous social events.

It's been a whirlwind of movie premieres, fashion weeks and the Oscars - and on Wednesday night our favourite celebrities had yet another social event to squeeze into their jam-packed calendars.

Stars including Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran and Cara Delevingne descended on London's 02 to attend the biggest night in the music calendar: the Brit Awards 2015.

Luckily for the busy celebrities, who are in need of some last-minute pampering, the Brits now hosts its very own spa backstage offering head-to-toe treatments including spray tans, hair transformations and five star facials.

FEMAIL went backstage at the spa to find out which nominees and presenters were beautified in the spa tucked behind the main stage, exactly what they had and how we could emulate their look at home.

Bespoke treatments created especially for the night helped to relieve the stresses of rehearsals and ensure that the performers and their crew looked pristine for the gauntlet of flashbulbs.

First stop? The Simple skincare rehydration station, where stars were treated to express facial workouts aimed to hydrate skin in the spotlight.

In partnership with Face Gym (the world's first spa workout for your facial muscles), therapists were on hand to help revitalise the A-listers' skin. Ideal for all the stars who had been partying at fashion week or over in the states, there was an after-party skin workout, a jet set skin workout and a glow-getter treatment.

Each treatment was aimed at reducing puffiness, aiding lympathic draining and leaving the skin looking flawless for the performances and parties.

Celebrities are lucky enough to test out exclusive products for the first time and Simple - loved by Cara Delevingne and Fearne Cotton - used the opportunity to launch their  Kind To Skin Micellar Cleansing Water, which was left in every stars' dressing room.

Rita Ora was a big fan and her make-up artist picked up plenty of the mini versions to keep her going when she's jet-setting.

Party-perfect hair came courtesy of V05, who set up a station in the spa dedicated to coiffing the stars' locks to perfection.

Laura Whitmore stocked up on Vita Liberata tanning products to give her a healthy glow for the awards

Head stylist and celebrity favourite, Claire Rothstein, who works with the biggest names in music, was on hand to offer a different look to suit every personality. The most popular look of the night? The Rothstein tousle – a secret styling technique the hair maestro pioneered herself to give anyone locks to rival Kate Moss'.

'Tressed' to impress, Taylor swept up the International Female Solo Artist Award, with her undone side sweep chignon. Want to get the look? Claire shared her top tips. 

'To recreate Taylor's look, first work the NEW VO5 Give Me Texture Effortless Creation Foam through your hair to add texture and volume, then blast hair upside down with a hair dryer and tip hair backwards. 

'Loosely scoop hair backwards, with your hands, ensuring you don't lose any of the volume and twist just above the nape of the neck and pin into a relaxed chignon – a current and edgy take on the classic look. Finish with a spritz of hairspray.'

The stars were also invited to get their glow on and have a spray tan by Vita Liberata - the non-toxic tanning brand loved by Kelly Brook.

Rita Ora, Laura Whitmore and Jo Whiley all stocked up on the brand's glow-worthy goodies and Take That's backing dancers were among the 60 performers who were treated to a spray tan.

Quick make-up touch-ups came courtesy of B. makeup – a vegan beauty brand (perfect for all the clean living celebrities).

Make-up artist to the stars, Cassie Lomas, created three exclusive 30-minute 'stage-ready' looks to prepare the stars for the spotlight. 'I can't wait to try these out on some old friends,' she said ahead of the show.

Cassie and her team offered Punkin' Eyes, which was the ultimate smokey eye, Disco Sculpt - a coveted contoured look - and a statement Pop Art Lip look, which over 300 performers had applied ahead of their stage debuts.

PRIV (the beauty and wellness on demand app) gave Cara Delevingne the perfect manicure ahead of the evening. She used the app to book her nails for the night and PRIV Professional Emily Gilmore looked after her creating the look using Chanel Malice, a shimmery plum. While Zara Martin used the app to have her locks coiffed ahead of the parties (all the biggest names hit the Warner afterparty and sipped on CÎROC vodka cocktails inspired by the award nominees).

The Brits were another stellar success; Sam Smith and Ed Sheeran were the hot favourites with five and four nominations to their names respectively.

And the singer-songwriters didn't disappoint on the night, taking home two gongs each on Wednesday during the glittering awards ceremony, which was held at the O2 Arena in London.

Ed, 24, was presented with British Male Solo Artist and British Album Of The Year, while the Global Success Award and British Breakthrough prizes went to 22-year-old Sam.
