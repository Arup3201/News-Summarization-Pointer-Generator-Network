David Cameron's 'nods and winks' that he might back Britain leaving the European Union is putting the nation's future prosperity in danger, Ed Miliband claims.

The Labour leader will use a speech tomorrow to warn the UK is being left increasingly isolated and is now on a 'conveyor belt towards exit with no idea how to get off'.

It comes as Home Secretary Theresa May warned that politicians who argue that the UK is better off in the EU 'whatever the terms, are wrong'.

David Cameron has promised to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU before holding an in-out referendum by 2017.

But Labour has refused to match the promise of giving voters a say on leaving the EU. 

In a speech to the CBI tomorrow, Mr Miliband will accuse the Prime Minister of putting millions of jobs at risk.

He will also pledge not to play 'political games' with Britain's EU membership and insist Labour has a credible and clear plan to secure reforms.

He will say: 'There are some people in our country who advocate exit from the EU. There are others who flirt with it, thinking they can do so without consequence. Both are equally dangerous.

'Giving succour to the argument that the real answer is leaving the EU, or contemplating it, simply drags us closer to exit.

'And every nod and wink to those who want to leave sends a message to potential investors in our country that we are not open for business.

'It is a betrayal of our national interest. It is a clear and present danger to our future prosperity.

'The way to overcome these false solutions is not to pander to them. Not to posture about finding ways of accommodating them. Not to make promises everyone knows you cannot keep.'

Efforts to secure concessions from Brussels were undermined by a shock demand for an extra £1.7billion from Britain last month.

On Friday Chancellor George Osborne boasted that he had halved the bill to £850million.

But critics accused him of 'smoke and mirrors', by bringing forward a rebate payment from 2015 which was always going to be paid.

Critics have claimed the reduction in the £1.7 billion bill had been achieved by bringing forward a rebate to which the UK would have been entitled anyway.

Mr Miliband will say Britain must build alliances rather than burn them to help change the EU so it works for Britain.

'Under a Labour government, there will be no further transfer of powers to the European Union without the explicit consent of the British people in an in/out referendum,' he will say.

'But we have seen over the last couple of years that trying to use exit as a threat has simply weakened our influence, not strengthened it.

'A country making ever-more incoherent demands, ever-more isolated from its partners, is one on the conveyor belt towards exit with no idea how to get off.

'We have seen it again with the controversy over the EU budget: banging the table one day, then paying up the next.

'Instead of posturing, Britain should be forging alliances now to make real reform happen and taking our rightful place in forging the future of Europe.'

He will add: 'I make you this promise: if I am prime minister I will never risk your businesses, British jobs or British prosperity by playing political games with our membership of the European Union.

'We will reform the European Union, not threaten to leave, not pretend that is the answer, not playing fast and loose with Britain's future, Britain's prosperity and your businesses.' 

Mrs May, the Home Secretary, today suggested Britain should leave the EU unless it changes.

Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Mrs May made a wider plea for major reforms to the way the EU operates to work in the UK's interests.

She said: 'While access to the world's biggest single market is in our national interest, the EU's rules and regulations hold back not just our economy, but also the economies of every other member state. That is why we need to argue for changes that make the EU more competitive, more outward-looking and more open to global trade.

'These are the reasons I believe that the politicians who argue that we are better off in the EU, whatever the terms, are wrong. But I also believe that the politicians who argue that we are better off out, whatever the terms, are also wrong.

'Because if we can make Europe work differently - if we can work towards a more flexible union of sovereign member states who use treaties and institutions to trade freely and co-operate in the fight against crime and terrorism - it will surely be in our national interest to remain members of the European Union.'
