A 20-year-old man sobbed in court today as he was charged with the manslaughter of two teenage girls who died after they were hit by a car.

Samuel Etherington, from Gosport, Hampshire, appeared at Portsmouth Magistrates' Court today after detectives charged him last night. He was remanded in custody ahead of another hearing at Winchester Crown Court tomorrow.

Police were called to Ann's Hill Road in Gosport at 4.15am on Sunday following reports that a green Honda Civic collided with two girls.

Jasmine Allsop, 14, died at the scene, while Olivia Lewry, 16, died later after being taken to hospital.

Etherington, an unemployed football coach, wore a blue jumper and grey tracksuit trousers in the dock today, and wept as details of the girls' death were read out.

He spoke only to confirm his name, address and date of birth, and did not indicate how he will plead to the charges.

Ian Harris of the Crown Prosecution Service last night authorised Hampshire Constabulary to charge Etherington with two offences of gross negligence manslaughter.

'I have reached my decision after carefully considering all the available evidence provided to me by Hampshire Constabulary,' he said.

'I am satisfied, in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors, that there is sufficient evidence and that it is in the public interest to prosecute Samuel Etherington for these offences.

'Jasmine and Olivia have died in tragic circumstances and I would like to extend my very deepest sympathies to their families and friends.'

Allegations: The defendant was arrested by police soon after the two girls' deaths

Jasmine's mother Rose Allsop, 37, has spoken of
 the moment she ran out of her house to see her daughter lying in the 
road, before picking her up and saying her final goodbye.

She said: 'I went out and then a neighbour covered me in a blanket. I kissed her - it was four hours before they took her body away because I did not want to let her go.

'I told her she was my angel and I'd loved her since the day she was born. I can remember her big blue eyes staring.'

The housewife, who is also the mother of a four-year-old, said the death has left her numb. She said: 'I'm empty inside and lost. I keep expecting her to come through the door.'

Happy: Jasmine, left, and Olivia, right, both looked happy and smiled as they posed for photographs in the early hours on Sunday

Friends: Jasmine, left, died outside her home shortly after the collision. Olivia, right, was taken to hospital where she later died on Sunday

'I can't believe she's gone': Rosemary Allsop is comforted by a well-wisher as she looks at the floral tributes left by her daughter's friends

The
 girls were apparently hit by a green Honda Civic around 20 yards from 
Jasmine's terraced house as they walked home at about 4.15am.

Jasmine – known as Jas – died at the scene, while Olivia was taken to hospital with severe injuries but died later on Sunday.

Jasmine's mother has spoken outside her 
home, describing the heart-rending moment she visited her 
daughter in a hospital mortuary.

I've
 only just been to see her body. I can't believe she's gone,' said Ms Allsop.

'She would 
have loved to see all these flowers and to see how much she meant to 
everybody.

'It's harder for me that she died right outside my house.

'I
 didn't let her go for four hours when it happened.

'I was just kissing 
her and holding her in the road - I couldn't bear to let her go.

'I looked into her big blue eyes and told her she had always been my angel and I had always loved her.'

She added: 'She had hundreds of friends and they've all been here to pay their respects.

'Tonight her friends are all heading to the local park to light lanterns, play music and just remember the girls.

'I don't know if we'll go along - it was all a bit too much last night when they did something similar.

'There must have been 200 people there, even though it was pouring with rain.

'At school today they even held an assembly for Jasmine and Olivia and the school sent flowers to us too, which was lovely.

'The response from everyone has been amazing.

'Now I just feel empty. It's awful, because I keep expecting her to walk back through the front door.' 

Tributes: Friends have left bunches of flowers at the scene of the two girls' death, and have gathered to remember the teenagers

'Sleep tight': One friend's heartfelt tribute to Olivia, who has died at the age of just 16

Ms
 Allsop said earlier that she had been enjoying a 'girly night' watching 
horror films with the teenagers. Emergency services had woken her in the 
middle of the night.

'It
 was just all a blur,' she said. 'I cannot remember what happened. I had
 gone to bed. I didn't see anything. I just thought they were playing 
CDs and talking about boys and make-up.'

She added: 'I'm empty inside and lost. I keep expecting her to come through the door.

'We
 had a girls' night in. Jasmine was straightening my hair and plucking 
my eyebrows and Olivia was here. Jasmine was a gorgeous, lovely, bubbly 
character - they were best friends.'

Mourners: Two friends carry flowers to the scene, which was cordoned off as police continued their investigation

Jasmine's
 father Kevin MacLaughlan, 58, also paid tribute to his daughter, 
saying: 'She was beautiful. The most beautiful, bubbly natured girl - 
outgoing and affectionate, very caring and bubbly.'

The 14-year-old was studying at Brune Park Community School, where Olivia used to be a pupil.

Head
 teacher Richard Kelly said: 'They were both independent, strong-minded 
individuals who lived their lives to the full with confidence and a 
sense of humour and a sense of fun.

'We
 will miss them both immensely and the unique talents which they 
displayed. Our thoughts and prayers are with their families at this 
dreadful time.'

Di 
Lloyd, principal of St Vincent College where the older girl was studying
 at the time of her death, said: 'We're sending our sincere condolences 
to Olivia's family.

'We're
 very shocked and saddened. At the moment everyone is coming to terms 
with it and preparing to support the students who are coming in today.'
