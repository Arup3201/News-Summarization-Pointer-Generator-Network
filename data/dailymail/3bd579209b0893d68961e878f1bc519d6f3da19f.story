Getting devoured by an army of angry ants isn’t something most people would volunteer for.

But 27-year-old YouTube sensation Andrew Ucles, who hails from Wollongong, south of Sydney, is not your average Joe.

In a peculiar new video uploaded to his channel this week, the animal enthusiast lies on a large meat ant nest in a dubious bid to walk in the shoes of an echidna.

‘I thought I would try to stick it out for 10 minutes on an ants nest to give me some sense of an idea what feeding time is actually like for an echidna,’ he commentates.

Despite the ear plus jammed in his nose for protection, Ucles falls short of his goal, lasting about 30 seconds before lurching to his feet.

‘I’ve got ants in my pants’ he declares, laughing maniacally as he bounds into a nearby lake.

Earlier in the same clip, Ucles-who aspires to Bear Grylls and Steve Irwin-scoops up an echidna with his bare hands.

In another video uploaded last month, Ucles he uses a red bellied snakes to lure rabbits out of their burrows and capture them in his trademark style. 

A graduate of Environmental Science, the rogue environmentalist snares the likes of snakes, crocodiles and sharks with his unprotected mitts.

Ucles claims his barehanded method teaches people about the fragility of ecosystems, in turn promoting animal conservation.

While his logic isn’t exactly hole-proof, his popularity is: Ucles YouTube channel has over two million views, and he’s recently featured in an internationally acclaimed television documentary.

The Wollongong local made news around the world in 2010 when he vanished into the outback for three months without food or spare clothing in an effort to raise awareness about wildlife conservation.

In a farewell message he declared: 'There is a great chance that I may not return, but I feel as though the message that needs to be conveyed is greater.'

Ucles reportedly stayed with an aboriginal tribe in dentral Queensland, who taught him their lifestyle and hunting techniques.
