Racegoers trying to pick a winner at Kempton Park racecourse have a new handicap to consider – an invasion of swans.

One jockey has even been unseated during a race thanks to swans wandering on the track, while on other occasions the birds have flown close to riders travelling at almost 30mph.

Now the racecourse owners have sought the Queen’s permission to round up the birds.

At least 27 swans have taken up residence at Kempton Park racecourse in Surrey where there have been several close calls such as here when the birds crossed the course just yards from the riders

At least 27 swans have taken up residence at the track. And although riders and horses have so far escaped serious injury, there have been several close calls.

Last year, amateur jockey Harrison Beswick was thrown from his horse Dark Energy when a swan and her two cygnets wandered on to the course. The horse managed to hurdle the swans – amid a flurry of feathers – but the evasive action meant Mr Beswick was thrown to the ground.

Racegoers have so far been unaffected, largely thanks to a new perimeter fence, but the swans continue to wander close to horses and riders travelling at speed.

The situation is so serious that talks were held at the Surrey course last week which could lead to the birds being evicted. 

And as the Queen has a prerogative over all swans in England and Wales, course officials have had to seek permission from Her Majesty’s Swan Marker, David Barber, to deal with the situation. Mr Barber said: ‘Buckingham Palace is well aware of the situation at Kempton Park. We are very keen that the swans are looked after and no harm comes to them or the horses and their riders.’

Clerk of the course Barney Clifford says the behaviour of the birds is unusual. ‘The swan’s normal characteristics are to land on water, then move from water to land to feed,’ he said. ‘Unfortunately the Kempton Park swans land and take off on our turf track because it is so compacted they feel comfortable on it.

‘When airborne, they can go anywhere, and on a couple of occasions a swan has flown very close to a jockey. I can deal with most things but I don’t have an aviation control tower.’

One theory for the growing numbers of swans at Kempton is that it follows the culling of foxes.

Mr Barber has made no objection to a transportation licence now being considered by Natural England. Mr Clifford added: ‘I am sure there will be some swans relocated, but we may leave a breeding pair who will fight other swans if they try to come back.’
