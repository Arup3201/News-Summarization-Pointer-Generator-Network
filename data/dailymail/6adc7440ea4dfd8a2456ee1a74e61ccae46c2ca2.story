A father and son have gone missing in the snowy wilds of Colorado's highlands after they set off on a spring-break bonding trip five days ago.

Damian McManus, 51, and his 18-year-old son Evan, from St. Louis Park, in Minnesota, were last heard from on Saturday as they headed up a mountain near Echo Lake, west of Denver.

Just before the pair began to hike across the mountain, Evan texted his girlfriend, Ashley Ritten, promising to message her again when they had completed the trek.

She did not hear from him again.

Alpine search and rescue teams are now scouring the area which they described as 'very cold and very windy' as snowstorms swept the region, known for its poor cell-phone reception.

The trip was meant to be a spring break 
bonding experience for the father and son, part of a school programme. 
While they went mountaineering, Evan's twin sister, Lauren, joined their mother, 
Katherine, on a visit to Mexico with friends.

In a message posted on a Facebook page dedicated to the missing pair, Miss Ritten wrote that she feared they may have been caught in an avalanche, but added: 'The chances are very slim as they are often known about right away.'

Evan is a senior at Saint Louis Park High School

She went on: 'Evan told me they were planning on coming home Saturday, so that is when my suspicions really raised.

'The last person they contacted was me when I asked Evan to text me around 5 after he was done hiking the mountain, I never got another text and just figured he couldn't text because bad reception.'

'My gut feeling is that one is 
seriously injured and the other is staying with him, but they are okay 
as long as they are found soon and they aren't suffering that bad, they 
are patient because Damian is smart and understands the situation he is 
in'

As fears mounted for their wellbeing, search and rescue teams continued the hunt at first light this morning with helicopters and snowmobiles.

Miss Ritten added: 'The boys had to be dressed somewhat warm, Evan told me before he left that it was going to be like 34 degrees, so he has to be dressed for cold weather.

'My gut feeling is that one is seriously injured and the other is staying with him, but they are okay as long as they are found soon and they aren't suffering that bad, they are patient because Damian is smart and understands the situation he is in.'

Meanwhile in Mexico, Katherine and Lauren were unaware of their family members' disappearance until they returned home over the weekend, assuming bad phone reception was behind their lack of communication.

'We became really worried when we got off the plane from Mexico this 
afternoon and [Katherine] still hadn't heard anything from Damian, we tried 
texting them and calling them and both of their phones were dead,' said 
family friend Andrea Bouzrara, who was along on the Mexico trip.

The McManus family has asked for anyone in the Echo Lake area who can help with information or details that could lead to Evan and Damian to get in touch. They have set up a Facebook page to raise awareness of their disappearance.

'They first of all want prayers everyone is found safely, if anyone has seen them please let authorities know right away because they are missed and loved,' said Bouzrara. 'Everyone is very, very worried for their safety.'
