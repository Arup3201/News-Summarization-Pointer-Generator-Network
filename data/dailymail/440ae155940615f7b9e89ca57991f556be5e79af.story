Fiona Nalty is accused of murdering Michael Hunt after allegedly kicking and punching the man to death when he chatted her up 

A woman kicked and punched a man to death after he tried to chat her up, a court has heard. 

Fiona Nalty and her boyfriend Arry Green beat Michael Hunt within an inch of his life and dumped his naked body in a skip following a row in a cab office, it was alleged.

After being discovered barely breathing and lying on top of rubbish in a skip in Norwood, south London, the 37-year-old died in hospital. 

Nalty, 24, from Coulsdon, Surrey, and her 21-year-old boyfriend from Norwood both deny murder.

The Old Bailey heard the victim had been drinking with Nalty and Green in the Portmanor pub on March 13. 

In the early hours of March 14, the three were in a shop on South Norwood High Street where Hunt, originally from County Waterford in Ireland, appeared to be 'chatting up' the woman. 

Next they were spotted in Courier Cars - a minicab office - where a row broke out after a driver said they were too drunk to be taken home. 

'Mr Hunt was not aggressive, he tried to calm Mr Green and Miss Nalty down,' said David Jeremy, prosecuting. 

‘He told them they would not get a cab if they behaved like that. The three of them then left the office.'

‘After they had left, the cab controller Mr Bill Peters looked out into the street and saw Miss Nalty punching Mr Hunt to the face more than once and push him around.

'He was not retaliating. The group them left the area. Mr Peters could still hear Miss Nalty shouting and swearing as they went.’

Michael Hunt was found in a skip having had his clothes taken from his body after being punched and kicked in the head. The 37-year-old died in hospital after suffering a massive heart attack 

When the 37-year-old started grappling with the woman, her boyfriend joined in the attack, it was alleged. 

A 15-year-old boy who was with the group at the time said Nalty then began kicking Mr Hunt in the head. 

‘They had ended up in the alleyway where the boy had seen Fiona Nalty kicking Mr Hunt to the head as a he lay on the floor.'

‘He thought he saw Mr Green kicking him as well, but he only had a glimpse of that as it was so nasty he looked away.

‘Mr Hunt did not hit anyone. All he had tried to do was protect himself.

‘But every time that he had tried to get up he was kicked again,' Mr Jeremy added. 

‘The boy said he heard Mr Hunt shouting: “Stop, please stop.”

‘He could not face what he saw and he had walked away. He remembered Nalty laughing as he did so.’ 

Nalty and her boyfriend deny the murder of Michael Hunt. The trial at the Old Bailey in London continues 

When she emerged from the alleyway Nalty allegedly bragged: ‘We f****d him up bad’ and the boy saw blood on her foot and leg.

Mr Hunt was still breathing when his body was found in the skip at around 7am on the morning of March 14 this year, but his skull had been fractured. 

‘Mr Hunt was lying on the skip on top of the general debris. He was completely naked save for a bandana around his neck,’ Mr Jeremy said.

‘It follows that as an act of humiliation the defendants must have removed his clothing as or after they had beaten him into unconsciousness.’ 

He died in hospital of a massive heart attack days later.  

Police recovered clothes stained with Mr Hunt’s blood from the garden of a home in Purley when Green was arrested there.

Nalty was found in an address in Brighton and told police: ‘I didn’t do it..’

Both deny murder at the Old Bailey. 

The trial continues.
