Emerging from its den with its mother, a polar bear cub raises its head above the snow and looks out at the freezing world it calls home.

Wildlife photographer Christine Haines captured the images after she spent eight days watching the den.

Her patience in the biting cold of the Wapusk National Park in Manitoba, Canada, was rewarded when she managed to capture pictures of first a cub, then its mother peeking out of their hole.

Sniffing for danger: The cub's mother also poked her head out of the den before sniffing the air to check for any danger, such as wolves

She said: 'I was there to photograph polar bear mothers and cubs emerging from their den. I watched a den for eight days in minus 40 degree temperatures with wind chill.

'The image I call "Playing Peek-a-Boo with the Photographer" was the first time the cub looked out of its den. This was on day seven.'

She said on the eighth day both the cub and its mother finally peeked out the den at susnset.

She said: 'The mother was sniffing the air to check for any danger like wolves.

'Photographing wildlife can be challenging and frustrating, but I did capture the mother and cub peeking out of their den in nice lighting.

'It was reported to me that they finally left the den on day 10. The mother hasn't eaten for approximately eight months.

'They might stay around the den for a couple of days so the cub can build up its strength for the journey to Hudson Bay located by Churchill, Manitoba. Here she will hunt for seals.'
