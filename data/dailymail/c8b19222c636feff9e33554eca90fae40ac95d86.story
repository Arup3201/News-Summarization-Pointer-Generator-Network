A family from Florida have been told they must get rid of their pet pot-bellied pig or risk losing their home, after council bosses referred to 'outdated' rules.

David Kirkman and his wife Laura have been told keeping Buttercup, their 250lbs pet, is in breach of a Pensacola city council regulation, which bans 'livestock' from within the city boundaries.

The couple, along with their two children, nine-year-old Molly and Butch, seven, have argued Buttercup is a pet and should not be classed as livestock.

The family raised the two-year-old pot-bellied pig from the age of five weeks old, and she sleeps along with the family dog, Muck, in the children's bedrooms.

But the city council have given the family until May to get rid of Buttercup or risk losing their home.

The Pensacola News Journal reported the council received an anonymous tip that the Kirkmans were keeping a pig on their property, in December.

The council rule states, 'It shall be unlawful to keep any horse, mule, donkey, goat, sheep, hogs and cattle in any stable, shed, pen or enclosure within city limits.'

Mrs Kirkman said the ordinance or regulation refers to 'hogs' in the plural, and despite her size she is still 'just one pig'.

'We're not going to eat her and we're not going to sell her,' said Molly Kirkman, nine.

'She doesn't live on a farm. She sleeps in my room.'

The family has taken their case to council member Sherri Myers, who has agreed to backed their cause.

Ms Myers branded the rules 'pretty outdated', adding she is working to submit a council agenda item that would exclude pot-bellied pigs from the definition of livestock.

She said they should be classified as domestic animals.

Ms Myers said she recently discovered a pot-bellied pig wandering in her neighbourhood.

She said: 'The whole neighborhood was excited that there was a pot-bellied pig around.'

The mystery was solved when Ms Myers and her neighbours learned a friend was pet-sitting the pig, which had escaped.

'It was kind of exciting for our neighborhood,' Ms Myers added.

The Kirkmans said they receive the same excited response from people who meet Buttercup.

'She's not noisy. She's not smelly, she's not trouble to anyone,' Mrs Kirkman said.

'Most people love her. She's an attraction around here.'

But she added, the saga has been a good learning curve for her children, teaching them how to tackle a problem head on.

'They're learning how to handle a problem,' Mrs Kirkman said. 'They're learning to do things the right way, and to show respect while they're doing it.'
