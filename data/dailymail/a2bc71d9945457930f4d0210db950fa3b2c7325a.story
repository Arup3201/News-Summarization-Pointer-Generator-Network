Coronation Street star Neville Buswell has denied he flashed an underage girl in the 1960s.

His comments follow reports police in Lancashire had interviewed two women about historic allegations of inappropriate behaviour in the last week.

Mr Buswell said he had never met the woman involved and denied any wrong-doing.

Return: Mr Buswell's character Ray was written back into the show in 2005 for a six-week run

The actor, 70, played Ray Langton in the soap during the 1960s and 1970s, and was written back in for a six-week run in 2005 before his character was killed off.

Speaking from his home in Las Vegas this week, he told theÂ Sunday Mirror he had been following news of the arrests and charges of his former co-stars Bill Roache, Michael Le Vell and Andrew Lancel over sex offences.

He said: 'It is amazing what is going on over there. It's terrible what's going on and I will be honest, I have been following it.'

One of his former colleagues, who was not named, told the paper Mr Buswell was 'a lovely bloke'.

They added: 'It's hard to believe he'd get himself in bother with anyone. The idea that he would expose himself to a young girl seems laughable.'

Mr Buswell first appeared in the long-running soap in 1966. His womanising character had several flings before marring Deirdre Hunt in 1975.

He ended his contract in 1978 and was
written out of the show after having an affair with waitress Janice 
Stubbs that ended his on-screen marriage.

The actor left the UK and moved to the US with his wife, where he worked as a croupier and manager in a casino for 13 years.

He
appeared in a one-off special edition of Coronation Street in Las Vegas
in 1997, before being written back into the show in 2005. After six 
weeks on air, his character died of cancer.

The allegation follows those against Bill Roache, Michael Le Vell and Andrew Lancel.

Roache has been charged with two counts of rape and will appear in court next month. He strenuously denies the claims.

Lancel will also appear in court in June charged with six counts of indecently assaulting a boy under the age of 15 - something he also denies.

Le Vell has pleaded not guilty to 19 sexual offences against a child, including rape.
