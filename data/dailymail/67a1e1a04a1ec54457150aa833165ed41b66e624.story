A gang of drug dealers have been jailed for more than 60 years after a huge police operation caught them moving high-purity cocaine in and out of the north of England.

The 12 men were caught after the police surveillance operation - code-named Skyhawk - resulted in 200 officers raiding homes across County Durham and Merseyside in February last year.

Gang boss Timothy John Lister, 40, was jailed for 16 years at Teesside Crown Court yesterday, while Sam Turnbull, 36, received 11 years and two months and Alan Crawford, 42, was sentenced to nine years.

Gang boss Timothy John Lister, 40, (left) was jailed for 16 years at Teesside Crown Court, while Sam Turnbull, 36, (right) received 11 years and two months. They were both convicted of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs

Alan Crawford, 42, (left) was sentenced to nine years in prison for his involvement in the plot to move 'pure' cocaine in out of the North, while Ian McCabe, 43, (right) was sentenced to five years and four months

All three faced charges of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs after police seized three separate 1kg consignments of almost pure cocaine during the course of the operation.

Detective Chief Inspector Victoria Fuller, head of Durham Police's specialist crime operations unit, said the gang had operated across the North East and North West.

Almost £125,000 in cash and 24kg of Class B cannabis resin were also recovered from the gang, described as 'at, or very near, the top of the supply chain'.

The cocaine's packaging and purity indicated they were 'wholesalers' selling 'virtually pure product in bulk'.

The court heard how the business was directed by Lister who had links to the North West, West Yorkshire and Humberside.

Gang member Gary John Kays, from Liverpool, who acted as a middle-man moving drugs between the North East and North West, was jailed for three years and five months.

Kays was previously jailed for seven years in 2008 after helping Sean Mercer destroy evidence linking him to the murder of 11-year-old schoolboy Rhys Jones. The tragic killing made headlines when Rhys was shot in car park of a pub in August 2007.

Stephen John Golding, 33, from Liverpool, was jailed for five years and six months yesterday, while Ian McCabe, 43, from County Durham, will also serve more than five years.

The other members of the gang received either prison terms of two years or less, a suspended sentence or community order. One man has yet to be sentenced and will be dealt with by the court on Monday next week.

Detective Chief Inspector Fuller said: 'The sentences given by the court demonstrate very clearly that those who choose a life of organised crime will be caught and dealt with.

The gang members were sentenced to a total of 60 years in jail when they appeared at Teesside Crown Court

'The men we arrested were, quite simply, horrible people who only cared for themselves. At no stage did they give a single thought to the misery their offending inflicted on communities or the innocent people caught up in their activities.

'This is not just about the damage drugs themselves may cause but the associated crime which can badly affect communities, not just in our area but others as well.

'Our aim is to keep the communities of County Durham safe, and the fact we arrested people from Merseyside, Humberside and the Greater Manchester area as well as the North East shows how this type of crime cuts across boundaries.'
