A warring Chicago couple due to appear on the Maury show never got the chance to air their grievances on TV – because they were jailed the night before after allegedly fighting each other in their hotel.

John Coley, 46, and Shantae McGhee-Brown, 25, were supposed to be booked into separate hotels, but the show’s producer made the mistake of booking them both into the DoubleTree in Norwalk, Connecticut.

Their dispute centers on claims by McGhee-Brown that Coley slept with her mother – and he was due to take a lie detector test on the popular talk show.

However, the pair bumped into each other in the hotel the night before the taping was due to take place and they both lost their temper.

Police were called to deal with the disturbance and found McGhee-Brown in hallway dressed only in a towel, according to The Hour.

She told officers that during the course of the brawl with Cole, she had thrown a vase and broken a table.

They were both charged with disorderly conduct and criminal mischief after the incident last month, with McGhee-Brown also charged with interfering with police.

The pair were held in custody overnight and missed the show.

Maury Povich’s staple diet is talking to guests with drinking problems, serial cheaters and disputes over parent identities.
