Not content with world domination, California-based Google is ramping up its efforts to expand its business into the cosmos.

After purchasing satellite maker Skybox earlier this week for £300 million ($500 million), the tech giant is now said to be preparing to buy a stake in Sir Richard Branson’s space tourism company Virgin Galactic.

The £18 million ($30 million) deal would give Google access to Galactic’s LauncherOne, capable of launching satellites into space within a few years.

Google is apparently in advanced talks with Virgin Galactic to buy a 1.5 per cent stake in the company at £18 million ($30 million). This would value the firm at £1.2 billion ($2 billion). The deal would give Google access to Galactic's cargo spacecraft LauncherOne, the sibling to the passenger-carrying SpaceShipTwo (pictured)

The deal would give Google a 1.5 per cent stake in New Mexico-based Virgin Galactic, and value the company at £1.2 billion ($2 billion), reports Sky News.

In June 2013 Google announced Project Loon, an endeavour to send balloons high into the atmosphere that would provide internet coverage to remote areas.

Then in April this year, Google acquired Titan Aerospace, a drone startup company that makes high-flying robots.

This was followed in June by the £300 million ($500 million) acquisition of Californian satellite maker Skybox, which will boost the quality of images in Google Maps.

And now the merger with Virgin Galactic will allow Google to start launching its own satellites into space, with the goal of expanding its influence around the world.

This would allow them to begin launching a fleet of satellites - an apparent goal for the company needed to expand their influence around the world.

The talks are also expected to have a second outcome, in which Google will invest hundreds of millions of dollars in Virgin Galactic, with a view to building the world’s first space tourism business.

LauncherOne is perhaps lesser known than the main ship of Galactic’s business, SpaceShipTwo.

The latter is a passenger-carrying spaceplane that, beginning later this year or early next, will take six paying customers on brief six-minute forays into space.

To reach beyond the official ‘line’ of space (known the Karman line, 62 miles or 100 kilometres up) SpaceShipTwo is carried to an altitude of 50,000 feet (15,500 metres) by the WhiteKnightTwo mothership before detaching and using its rocket to reach space.

In the past year Google (headquarters in California pictured) has begun to take giant leaps towards space. It began last year with the announcement of a high-altitude balloon project called Project Loon. In the last two months the tech giant bought a drone company, acquired a satellite firm and is now investing in Virgin Galactic

Virgin Galactic is expected to begin commercial flights of its SpaceShipTwo vehicle later this year or early next, with flights of its cargo-carrying LauncherOne vehicle to begin at a later date.

Tickets to ride into space are now valued at £150,000 ($250,000) with celebrities including Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks and Justin Bieber apparently already stumping up the money for a ticket. 

Crew: 2

Capacity: 6 passengers

Length: 60 feet (18.3 metres)

Wingspan: 27 feet (8.3 metres)

Height: 18 feet (5.5 metres) with rudders down

Loaded weight: 9,740 kilograms (21,428 pounds)

Alongside SpaceShipTwo Branson is developing LauncherOne, an unmanned payload-carrying rocket that would be sent into space from the same WhiteKnightTwo plane.

On board it will be capable of carrying experiments paid for by various companies around the world.

The rocket, after detatching from WhiteKnightTwo, will then accelerate to speeds that will enable it to enter low-Earth orbit, where it can then release the satellites it is carrying.

And Google has clearly seen the potential of this technology to launch satellites into orbit for a relatively low cost with its latest moves.

Earlier this week it bought satellite firm Skybox as 
the first step in its project to improve its maps and bring the internet
 to developing countries.

The acquisition will initially be 
used to boost the quality of Google's maps images as it battles Apple.

Skybox
 has previously hit the headlines for capturing the first HD video footage 
of Earth from its tiny satellite - which many dubbed at the time as 
being 'like live Google maps.'

Google is buying Skybox Imaging in a deal that could serve as a launching pad for the company to send its own fleet of satellites in to space. These satellites would take aerial pictures and provide online access to remote areas of the world. This photo of Kiev, Ukraine was taken by Skybox on 18 February 2014

SkySat-1, which was launched in November, captured up to 90-second video clips at 30 frames per second.

Satellites
 today are capable of taking imagery better than a metre in resolution, 
but they weigh thousands of kilograms. SkySat-1 is 20 times smaller than
 traditional satellites.

The circuitry that drives it is about the size of a phone book and consumes less power than a 100-watt light bulb.

The
 US group, Skybox Imaging, is now planning a constellation of 24 
satellites that will be able to cover almost the entire expanse of Earth. 

SkySat-2, an identical version of SkySat-1, is scheduled to launch later in 2014.

Google
 plans to use Skybox's satellite already in orbit to supplement the 
material it licenses from more than 1,000 sources, including other 
satellite companies such as DigitalGlobe and Astrium.

Eventually,
 though, Skybox could turn into another Google 'moonshot' - a term that chief executive Larry Page has embraced for describing ambitious projects that could
 take several years to materialise.

Google hopes to build more satellites that could be used to beam internet access to points around the world.

'Skybox’s satellites will help keep Google Maps accurate with up-to-date imagery,' the firm said.

'Over
 time, we also hope that Skybox’s team and technology will be able to 
help improve Internet access and disaster relief - areas Google has long
 been interested in.'

Satellites today are capable of taking imagery clearer than a metre in resolution, but they weigh thousands of kilograms. SkySat-1 is 20 times smaller than traditional satellites. Shown here is a view of Abu Dhabi

Google
 has made around 250 acquisitions during the past decade, using many of them 
to expand into new markets including maps and mobile devices.

To
 the frustration of some investors, Google also has been spending 
billions of dollars exploring new frontiers of technology, including 
driverless cars, internet-connected headwear, robots and a startup 
called Calico striving to find ways to slow the aging process.

Other
 investors have applauded Google for having the vision and audacity to 
make big bets on bold ideas that analysts say could hatch lucrative 
products in the rapidly changing technology industry.
