These beautiful lions yawning gracefully on their ranch in Nevada seem very content with being out of the wild.

But their brutal and lawless former home was a long way from the savanna.

It was at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Sunset Strip.

Future king: The MGM's 360-degree lion attraction closed in January, and the animals have lived free from intrusion for almost a year

Babyface: The ranch is open to the public on weekends and children can also interact with the cubs on a weekday

Each day for 11 years, owner Keith Evans would transport them from his ranch to the hedonistic, glitzy surrounds of the world-famous building.

Amid the 2,650 slot machines, 200 gaming tables and an atmosphere of 
Hollywood glamour, the animals would prowl around the Lion Habitat, 
watched by fascinated tourists.

Guests would get a 360-degree view of the creatures playing, sleeping and eating, in one of the hotel's most iconic gimmicks.

A year ago, however, the casino closed the attraction for renovations, and the pride has been getting some well-earned rest.

At long last, visitors can see the fierce animals again, after Mr Evans 
opened the doors to his Lion Habitat Ranch in nearby Henderson, Nevada.

It is a more restful set-up for the 40 big cats, with glass enclosures 
that only open at weekends and safety barriers to protect the tourists.

Children can even have a photo of themselves hugging cute cubs DJ, Pepe, Rock and Star - who were born in November after their parents relaxed into their new environment.

Mr Evans writes on his website: 'It is our desire and belief that we can make you fall in love with our lions and by doing so, we all will strive to protect and donate to wild lion habitats.

Fierce: The gates of the ranch are now open to the public on weekends, with 'Trainer 4 a Day' sessions, private tours and cub interactions also available on weekdays

Amazing creatures: Mr Evans says the ranch is constantly making improvements to lions' living quarters, and strives 'to protect and donate to wild lion habitats'. Pictured, trainer Wes Piper and a lioness

'It is and has been a privilege to be accepted by all of our lions over the last 22 years at this location. We are constantly making improvements to our lions' environment, well-being and living quarters.

'I have worked for over 40 years in close contact with all big cats and the social nature of lions has been my greatest pleasure.

'We are doing our best to provide a loving home for all the lions in our care for the rest of their natural lives.

'We would be pleased if anyone else would like to share in this goal.'
