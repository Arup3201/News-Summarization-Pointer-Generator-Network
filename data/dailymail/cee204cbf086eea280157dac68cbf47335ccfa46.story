There’s something magical about visiting iconic places after dark, and art fans will be soon be able to do just that at the Tate Britain.

Yet instead of travelling into London after hours, these unique tours will take place remotely through the use of web-controlled robots.

The scheme, called After Dark, lets virtual visitors drive these droids around the museum’s exhibitions, and see them in a new light - both figuratively and literally. 

The After Dark project was the winning idea in this year's Tate Britain IK Prize. It lets users remotely drive robots fitted with cameras around the museum. At the start of a session, four different tours, pictured, are shown at various points around the museum and visitors can choose the exhibition to visit

The IK Prize was set up by Tate Britain to ‘celebrate creative talent in the digital industry.’

There were four shortlisted proposals from a total of 51 entries. 

The runners-up included: Evan Boehm with Nexus Productions for Through the Eyes of an Eight-Year-Old. 

Adam Clarke from thecommonpeople.tv for TateCraft - an immersive experience where the museum was created in the land of Minecraft.

Storythings, by Matt Locke and Kim Plowright, for #TateText, which featured stories about the art work being shared on social media.

Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales was among the judges on the panel for the inaugural prize.

After Dark was created by London-based designers The Workers and was the winning concept of this year’s IK Prize.

After the project launches, each robot will be controlled online by a driver.

Other people from around the world can join that driver’s tour as passengers.

The virtual tours are timed, and once a driver’s turn comes to an end, the tour passes to one of the passengers.

As they make their way through the museum, a camera fitted with a light will shine on the exhibits and the visitors will be able to read details about the different art work on screen.

The IK Prize was set up by Tate Britain to 'celebrate creative talent in the digital industry.’

The Workers is a digital design studio set up in 2011 by Tommaso Lanza and Ross Cairns, with support from fellow designer David Di Duca.

As winners of the prize, the trio have been given a total £70,000 to set up and launch the After Dark scheme at the London museum by the summer – although an exact date hasn’t been announced.

According to Lanza: 'We’re not trying to give you this perfect representation of the art. It’s giving the art a different angle, and different light.'
