Sporting Lisbon president Bruno de Carvalho has labelled third-party ownership a 'monster that is living in almost all the clubs' following Marcos Rojo's move to Manchester United.

Rojo, set to make his debut against Queens Park Rangers on Sunday, left Sporting Lisbon for £16million during the summer transfer window, but was delayed as he awaited a work permit.

De Carvalho remains in a feud over the sale, though, as third-party owners Doyen Sports claim they are owed 75 per cent of the transfer fee. The Sporting president refuses to pay the £4m as he insists the original contract was invalid due to 'manipulation'.

Doyen Sports are an offshore outfit with investors and owners based in Malta. They buy stakes in players at major clubs in Spain and Portugal, hoping for a return. 

'One of the rules is that the funds cannot be engaging with the management and not manipulating the management, and they did it,' De Carvalho said at the Soccerex conference in Manchester, as reported by The Guardian.

'That contract means manipulation. It means engagement with the management. It's not a contract - it's null.'

And when asked if Rojo wanted to leave for Manchester, De Carvalho continued: 'He was very happy to be in Sporting but he felt the opportunity to come to Manchester was very good.

'I am against funds where we don't know where the money is coming from, and who try to manipulate football.

'Many times there is similar owners from the funds and gambling companies, so match-fixing is the worst fear now for football. Everybody's seeing the problem.'

He added: 'I think now (third-party ownership) is a monster. A monster that is living in almost all the clubs, so now I cannot see how (it can be banned) - the only solution is regulating it. We need to have a discussion very serious with everybody very quick.'

Doyen have denied any wrongdoing. A spokesman said: 'We categorically do not manage or influence the player and we ensure that is written into every contract we have with the club.

'This is the first ever issue we have had and it is with a specific president who now wants to renege on a bona fide contract that his club has signed. We welcome taking the matter to court.

'We operate in an open and transparent way and we welcome regulation in this sector.'
