She's lit up TV screens for many years with her warmth and friendly persona but television presenter Gabby Logan has revealed an 
altogether cattier side, describing Andy Murray as 'the moodiest most miserable b******' she has ever met.

The 40-year-old revealed her view of the two-time Grand Slam winner in a talk to students at Leeds Trinity University.

Speaking about Murray, the BBC Sports Presenter said: 'I was a big fan.

'Then at the Olympics he had just won a silver with Laura Robson and he was the moodiest most miserable b****** I've ever met in my life because he only won a silver.

'If I wasn't on live telly I'd have gone 'cheer up'." 

It wasn't just the 26-year-old Wimbledon champion who Logan had a dig at. 

According to The Sun she also poked fun at Paula Radcliffe who urinated in the street during 2005's London Marathon saying: 'One guy tweeted and said my wife thinks Paula's dress is nicer than yours. So I showed Paula and she p***ed herself. Again.' 

Speaking about Gary Lineker, she is reported to have said that most people see him now as a crisp salesman rather than a footballer adding 'sorry they see him as a broadcaster.'

A spokesman for Mrs Logan told The Sun: 'These people are friends and acquaintances of Gabby's who she has the utmost admiration for and the quotes clearly formed part of a humorous speech.' 

Last month Mrs Logan revealed she suffered body ‘angst’ when she was a teenager and that she now secretly fears for her daughter’s health.

The Splash! TV presenter admitted she and her husband worry that Lois, who is eight, could develop body image issues as she grows up. 

Mrs Logan represented Wales in rhythmic gymnastics but was forced to retire from the sport aged 17 due to sciatica.

She kept a diary during her teenage years and admitted that she wrote about feeling uncomfortable with her changing body once she hit puberty. 

Mrs Logan who co-presented Olympics 2012 for the BBC alongside Clare Balding, made her comments in a wide-ranging interview in which she spoke about the importance of healthy eating in her family and being able to recognise hunger.

Mrs Logan said: ’I would never want my daughter to think she had to eat less of something. We talk about over eating, about how that’s not good, to eat more than you need to.

‘But at the same time you can give those messages without it being about body image, it’s about health again. It all comes back to health as opposed to being svelte or fitting into your jeans.’

Mrs Logan, who is married to Kenny, 41, said: ‘I was always aware, when you do gymnastics you’re always in a leotard – you can’t be any more, the next thing is being naked. And so you’re very aware of your body so when I hit puberty I didn’t want to change.'

Mrs Logan has now joined a Tesco healthy eating campaign called Eat Happy.
