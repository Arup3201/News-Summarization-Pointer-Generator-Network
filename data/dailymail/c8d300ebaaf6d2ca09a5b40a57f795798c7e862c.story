More than 100,000 extra people are expected to sign up to become organ donors next year after a change to the way the public are asked to join the register.

Researchers found that people are far more likely to sign up if they are encouraged to think selfishly.

In a trial, more than one million people renewing their tax disc or registering for a driving licence online were presented with one of eight messages encouraging them to join the organ donor register.

Test: Researchers found that people are far more likely to sign up if they are encouraged to think selfishly

It was found that people were most likely to sign up if warned that they might need a transplant themselves one day.

The most successful question was: ‘If you needed an organ transplant, would you have one? If so, please help others.’

People were also more likely to register when presented with the negative warning that three people die every day because of a shortage of donors, than when given the positive message that becoming a donor will help to save lives.

Polls show that eight out of ten adults in Britain support organ donation. However, only one person in three is on the donor register.

Just over one million signed up last year and more than 19million are now registered.

Happy: Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude said he was pleased that the Behavioural Insights Team have examined how to improve sign-up rates

Ministers asked the Government’s Behavioural Insights team to find the best way of boosting donations.

In a five-week trial, those one million people renewing their tax disk or registering for a driving licence online were presented with one of eight different messages encouraging them to join the organ donation register.Each variant was prefixed with the call to 'Please join the NHS Organ Donor Register'. In order of effectiveness, the questions were: 

Those seeing the top message were one third more likely to sign up than those seeing the bottom two messages.

The
 simple message Please Join the NHS Organ Donor Register, which has been
 used for years, came seventh out of the eight messages.

The
 least successful message was: ‘Every day thousands of people who see 
this page decide to register’ which was accompanied by a picture of a 
smiling crowd.

Not much better performing was the slogan: ‘You could save or transform up to nine lives as an organ donor.’

On average people who saw the warning that they might need to receive an organ donation one day were one-third more likely to sign up than those who saw the original text or the group of people.

Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude said: ‘Since they were established after the 2010 General Election, the Behavioural Insights Team have worked to improve our public services and save hardworking taxpayers’ money.

‘This study shows yet again that what they do can make a real difference. Organ donation can transform people’s lives so I’m pleased that the team have examined how we can improve sign-up rates.’

Professor Anthony Warrens, President of the British Transplantation Society, said: ‘We have a responsibility to help people understand what an amazing act it is to donate organs and how it can transform the lives of so many others and we very warmly welcome publication of this study on how to improve the way we ask people to join the Organ Donor Register.

‘We know that 82 per cent of people in England would definitely donate or consider donating one or more of their organs.

‘We hope this new approach of asking people in a way that creates an appropriately positive and engaged mood will mean that a much larger number of them will convert that support into active registration.’
