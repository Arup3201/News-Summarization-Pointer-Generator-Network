GPs handing out antibiotics to placate demanding patients is leading to a rise in resistant superbugs that could send medicine 'back to the Dark Ages'

Family doctors are needlessly doling out antibiotics to ‘placate’ patients, an influential group of MPs warns today.

The practice of GPs using the drugs ‘simply to achieve a placebo effect’ is fuelling a growth in antibiotic resistance, according to a report by the Commons Science and Technology Committee.

The Mail reported last week how the country’s chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, said that patients pressing GPs for antibiotics were part of the problem.

She also said she will die from a routine infection if she undergoes a hip replacement operation 20 years from now.

Another expert said GPs were issuing the drugs to up to 90 per cent of the patients they see with distressing symptoms – whether or not they would be any use.

The problem is so serious that David Cameron last week said superbugs’ resistance to antibiotics could send medicine ‘back to the Dark Ages’.

Now he is being urged by the committee to back his words with ‘decisive and urgent action’ before it is too late to stem a tide of infections that cannot be treated.

The MPs’ report says: ‘For too long, antibiotics have been used as if they were a bottomless pit of cure-all miracle treatments.

‘Antibiotics are ineffective against viruses and other diseases that are not caused by bacteria and the unnecessary prescription of antibiotics has contributed to the acceleration of antibiotic resistance.’

The committee warned in particular of GPs using antibiotics as a placebo to make patients think they are getting effective treatments, even when the drugs have no medical impact.

Andrew Miller, chairman of the committee which has completed a seven-month inquiry, said: ‘Antibiotic resistance cannot be entirely prevented, but it is a problem made worse by inappropriate use and poor stewardship of antibiotics in healthcare and farming.

About 35¿million prescriptions for antibiotics are are given out a year by GPs in England. The number has risen 30 per cent since 2000 as 5,000 people a year die from resistant bacteria

‘We heard concerns, for instance, that antibiotics are often prescribed by GPs simply to achieve a placebo effect or placate patients with distressing symptoms.

'In farming, meanwhile, we suspect that antibiotics may be routinely used on healthy animals.’

Dr Michael Moore of the Royal College of General Practitioners told the committee that GPs were issuing antibiotics to up to nine out of ten patients, the report says.

Antibiotics, designed to fight bacteria, are routinely given to treat viral infections such as colds and flu. While patients may leave the surgery happy, the prescription will do little to fight their illness.

About 35 million prescriptions for antibiotics are dispensed every year by GPs in England. The number has risen 30 per cent since 2000, according to NHS figures.

Meanwhile 5,000 people die from antibiotic-resistant infections in England every year.

The NHS has brought down rates of two of the most serious superbugs – MRSA and C.difficile – through a huge awareness campaign and improved hygiene in hospitals.

But new threats have emerged to replace them, including E.coli, cases of which increased 30 per cent between 2005 and 2009.

The committee report says: ‘We found 
it difficult to understand how the Government has failed to act 
decisively to address the issue of inappropriate prescription of 
antibiotics.’

Dame Sally 
has asked the Government to put antibiotic resistance on the national 
risk register, ranking it alongside a large-scale terrorist attack.

She has warned that without action we may return to a ‘19th-century environment’ in which routine operations are potentially deadly.

She told the committee: ‘When I need a new hip in 20 years, I will die of a routine infection because we have run out of antibiotics.’

Mr Cameron announced last week that Jim O’Neill, former chief economist at Goldman Sachs, will lead an international group of experts aiming to spur drug development.

But Mr Miller said: ‘Publishing strategies and announcing reviews is not the same as dealing with the problem.

‘What we really need from Government right now is decisive and urgent action to prevent antibiotics from being given to people and animals who do not need them.’

The committee says greater public awareness is needed to ease pressure on GPs to dish out the drugs.
