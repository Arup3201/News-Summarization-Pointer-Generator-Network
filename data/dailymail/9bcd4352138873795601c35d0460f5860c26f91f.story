A bloated gym worker decided to kick his bad eating habits and get into shape after he discovered his boss was so ripped he was now entering a bodybuilding contest.

Chris Monk, 26, from Shaw in Oldham, Manchester, spent every day at the gym where he worked but didn't fit in with the super-buff crowd.

An avid fast food fan with long and irregular working hours, he would often pick up a McDonalds or KFC on his way home two or three times a week and also a takeaway at the weekends.

Chris Monk, 26, was bloated and decided to kick his bad eating habits and get into shape

Chris tried the the Body Makeover Challenge last year.

The
 fitness competition, run by supplement company USN, saw Chris attempt 
to improve his health and lifestyle as much as possible.

While he and saw great results, he still wasn't in peak physical condition.

Chris, who works in the gym 
membership department for a leisure club, admits his real goal the second time around was to fine tune his aesthetics.

'The
 real thing was the looks side of it. I wasn't overweight but I wasn't 
in the best shape. I just thought that's how it was and I couldn't 
change it.

'The six pack abs and the defined muscles you see in films seem to be something of a myth,' Chris recalls.

'Like
 so many others I accused them of using Photoshop or just made excuses 
like I’ve been working all day and couldn’t train instead.

'That's until I looked at my boss [Jonny Getty], last year's winner, and realised real people can get these amazing results.'

Jonny, the club's sales manager, had won the USN Body Makeover Challenge and was now preparing to compete in a bodybuilding competition.

So Chris signed up again from January 6 2014 and together with Jonny started working to progress and really transform his body in just 12 weeks.

And he couldn't be more delighted with the results.

Breakfast: Cereal such as bran flakes

Lunch: Large portion of pasta or spaghetti bolognese

Dinner: Sausage egg and chips or another type of takeaway

Snack: crisps and chocolate

Breakfast: Egg and salmon on granary bread

Lunch: Three small portions of turkey breast cous cous and veg

Dinner: Steak with sweet potato salad, then later peanut butter on granary bread

Snacks: Nuts, yoghurt fruit

The pair trained at the gym they both work at five times a week working on cardiovascular exercises such as cycling, running, swimming, and also resistance training focussing on biceps, chest, legs, back and core. Chris even managed to squeeze in his five-a-side footy training at the weekends.

That was coupled with three months of clean eating - that's ditching all that pasta, white bread and potato - and eating six small meals each day compared to his usual three large ones.

Chris also bought products from USN to supplement his regime. He drank three protein shakes a day; one first thing in the morning, one after training and one just before bed; took the amino acid tablets to protect muscle breakdown and help with recovery, took the ZMA tablets and also some of the pre-workout supplements.

'Motivation was always going to be the biggest hurdle for me,' he says.

'Twelve weeks sounds like nothing, but the first seven days of changing your routine and eating patterns felt like a month.

'But I cut out excess salt saturated fat and sugar, cut out fizzy drinks the weight started falling off.

'I changed my four large meals to seven 
smaller portions spaced at three-hour intervals,’ Chris explained.

Chris showed off his ripped physique in Croatia, and he now gets loads of attention

'I swapped my regular bran flakes breakfast for eggs
 and salmon on granary toast, and then for lunch I would have three 
small meals spread through the working day such as cous cous and 
tuna, rice and turkey and a chicken salad.

'I'd sometimes have three of the same for ease. It's all about meal prep - one of the most useful tips Jonny's given me.

'I 
also had a cheat meal every Saturday night, which in fact increase my 
motivation and spurred me on to train harder.'

After moving away from stodgy 
high-carbohydrate meals towards more protein and healthier options, in 
just over a month Chris could see a big difference.

The Challenge saw him lose more than a stone going from his heaviest at 12st 10lbs to 11st 5lbs.

Cardiovascular exercise 4-5 times a week for 30-45 minutes 
such as cycling, running, swimming and outdoor fitness activities.

Resistance exercise 4-5 times a week for 30-45 minutes focussing on biceps, chest, legs, back and core. 

He's
 now reached his goal and managed to get his body fat down to 7/8 per 
cent, when around Christmas it was about 15 per cent. He even managed to
 drop it down to 6 per cent for a recent holiday.

Chris has just 
returned from a hedonistic, much-deserved break to Croatia for Hideout Festival, where he wasted no time flaunting his pecs on 
the beach and at pool and boat parties.

'I'm
 a lot more confident I'm absolutely happy with how I look in pictures 
with my top off, especially compared to this time last year.'

And Chris, who is currently single, is getting plenty of attention and admiration since his transformation.

'I'm getting more attention from everyone. In the gym its really noticeable; all my friends are asking for diet advice.

'My housemate, who isn't ripped, saw my results and signed up to the Challenge himself afterwards.'

'The idea behind the challenge is its a bit of a competition and there's an annual winner [who gets £5,000],' says Chris.

While Chris didn't with the challenge overall, he has been excelling at sports and changed his life

'You take your before picture and then weekly progress pictures and keep a diary, logging your weight and measurements week to week. Only you and the USN staff can see this, not other competitors.

'It just motivates you to stay with your clean eating and training.'

There's an optional workout guide from the supplement company which can assist with the challenge.

It embraces both cardiovascular and resistance weight training for around 4-5 times per week and consists of a lean muscle gain diet plan aimed at improving weight loss and increasing toned, lean muscle tissue.

'Since the challenge has finished, I’ve continued to train at the same intensity to give me the results that I have always wanted,' says Chris

‘I encourage anyone that has struggled to achieve their goals in the past to set themselves the challenge and I guarantee they will be amazed by their own before and after pictures - just like me.'
