Francesco Totti has admitted that he is still uncertain over whether he will sign a contract extension with Roma.

The 38-year-old, who has been with the club for his entire career, still has two years to run on his current deal, and is expected to be offered the chance to extend his reign well past his 40th birthday.

'Will I sign for another year?' he said in an interview with La Repubblica. 'They're saying so, but until I sign [nothing is certain].'

The evergreen forward netted a superb chip away in a 1-1 draw at Manchester City on Tuesday night, a goal that made him the oldest goalscorer in Champions League history. 

And he admitted that he still loves the game and has not yet seriously considered the prospect of retirement.

'What will I do when I stop playing? When many players quit, they don't know where to turn,' he added.

'Football still entertains me. As long there is that passion, it remains a unique objective.'

Totti is a hero to Roma's fans after spending his entire career at the club

A hero to the capital club's fans, Totti has repeatedly been linked as a Roma manager of othe future. But the former Italy international does not believe he possesses the ruthless streak to require for the job. 

'I don't see myself doing it at the moment,' he explained. 'I'm too nice, although I've seen people like me start coaching and they've changed.

'I'm ruling it out now, but who knows?'
