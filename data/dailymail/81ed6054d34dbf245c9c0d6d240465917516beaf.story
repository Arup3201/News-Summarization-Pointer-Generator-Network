A pensioner who hasn't mowed his lawn for 30 years has been ordered to tidy his garden after neighbours claimed it was attracting rats and foxes to the area.

Ray Waldron, 75, has come under fire from neighbours after allowing weeds and bushes to grow up to 12ft tall outside his council-owned home.

He has lived in the £150,000 terraced property in Yardley Wood, Birmingham, since 1982 - but has not cut his grass once.

Mr Waldron is now being told he must tidy both his front and back gardens following complaints

Birmingham City Council today said they have contacted Mr Waldron after a string of complaints from neighbours.

They claimed his garden has attracted rats and foxes to the area.

Fed-up neighbour Brian Onions, 73, said: 'I have lived here for more than 30 years and in that time I have only ever known the property to be in the same state.

'The council has been out a number of times over the years but no enforcement action is ever taken against Mr Waldron to clean up the property.'

He said it was a 'really nice street' that was being 'dragged down' by the state of Mr Waldron's property.

He said: 'If I wanted to sell my property I would have no chance because I live next door to him.

'The council may have helped clean up his front and back gardens but it is back to being as bad as it has ever been.'

After being contacted by the city council Mr Waldron has said he is in the process of cleaning his garden

The council have included Mr Waldron in its vulnerable gardening scheme, a one-off service offering help to those unable to maintain their gardens.

A spokesman said: 'We have contacted Mr Waldron in the past and will do so again.

'It is worth noting, that within the city council’s conditions of tenancy we can enforce the upkeep of gardens.

'The council will work closely with Mr Waldron, as we understand how this problem can affect people in neighbouring properties.'

Mr Waldron claimed he was in the process of cleaning his garden up.

He said: 'I know there are a few neighbours who have been moaning about me.

'I will do my best to clean it up. I will get a skip in and sort something out.'
