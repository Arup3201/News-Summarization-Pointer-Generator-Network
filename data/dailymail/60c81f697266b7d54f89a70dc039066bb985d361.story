A stone knife found at a prehistoric gateway into Europe could force anthropologists to rewrite theories about how our human ancestors first arrived on the continent.

Archaeologists discovered the sharp stone tool at an ancient site on the Gediz river, to the east of Izmir, on the Anatolian peninsula of Turkey.

They believe the quartzite tool was made around 1.2 million years ago, meaning early humans were in the area far earlier than previously believed.

Archaeologists discovered the sharp stone tool at an ancient site on the Gediz river, to the east of Izmir, on the Anatolian peninsula of Turkey. The sharp quartzite stone tool (pictured) is thought to have been shaped using a technique called hard hammer flaking 

Sitting at the gateway between Asia and Europe, this could also mean scientists need to reassess how early humans entered Europe.

The earliest human remains to be discovered so far in Europe are 1.2 million-year-old bone fragments from the extinct Homo antecessor at Atapuerca, Spain.

The spread of human ancestors has been a controversial subject and has led to competing theories of how humans evolved.

Homo erectus migrated out of Africa around 1.8 million years ago.

By around 500,000 years ago it had vanished from Africa and much of Asia and was, until now, thought to have survived in Indonesia until as recently as 35,000 years ago.

Early modern humans reached the region about 40,000 years ago, and so were believed to have co-existed with their ancestors.

But recent research suggests this assumption was wrong - and Homo erectus disappeared long before the arrival of Homo sapiens in Asia.

Excavations in Indonesia, however, indicate that Homo erectus had gone extinct at least 143,000 years ago, and perhaps more than 550,000 years ago.

Another extinct species of human, called Homo antecessor, is thought to have been living in Atapuerca, Spain, at least 1.2 million years ago. Footprints attributed to Homo antecessor have also been found in Happisburgh in Norfolk. 

However, the discovery of stone tools in western Turkey could mean that another species, Homo erectus, whose remains have been found at sites nearby, could have also moved into Europe at around the same time.

Researchers from Royal Holloway University of London, now believe the discovery of the stone tool supports claims that Anatolia was occupied by these human ancestors 1.2 million years ago.

Professor Danielle Schreve, from the department of geography, said: 'This discovery is critical for establishing the timing and route of early human dispersal into Europe.

'Our research suggests the flake is the earliest securely-dated artefact from Turkey ever recorded and was dropped on the floodplain by an early hominin well over a million years ago.

'The dating of the flake suggests that the maker would have been Homo erectus, which is widely believed to have evolved in Africa and then spread into Eurasia by 2 million years.

'There is also a partial skull of Homo erectus from the site of Kocabas in Turkey - this particular site has been re-dated several times, with dates from around half a million to just over a million years old, so the new evidence from the Gedix River really firms up our knowledge of chronology of early human occupation in Turkey. 

'Home erectus were probably the first early humans to live in hunter-gatherer groups.' 

The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Quaternary Science Reviews, used high-precision radioisotopic dating and palaeomagnetic measurements from lava flows above and below the sediment where the stone was found, at a site known as Kale Tepe.

This means the lava flows both pre-date and post-date the appearance of the ancient deposits from the river Gediz where the tool was found.

This allowed the researchers to establish that early humans were present in the area between approximately 1.24 million and 1.17 million years ago. 

Previously, the oldest hominin fossils in western Turkey were the skull fragments recovered in 2007 at Koçabas, in Anatolia. 

The stone tool (inset) was found in the upper part of layer of U3 on the outcrop, just below M2. The earliest human remains found in Europe are 1.2 million-year-old bone fragments from the extinct Homo antecessor in Spain. The discovery of this tool could mean Homo erectus also moved into Europe at around the same time

The stone tool was dropped in ancient river sediment at Kale Tepe around 1.2 million years ago, close to where skull fragments thought to belong to human ancestor Homoe erectus were discovered at Koçabas

These fossilised remains are thought to be from Homo erectus and were initially dated as being 510,000 years old.

More recent research has revised this to being between 1.1 million and 1.3 million years old.

However the age of other stone artefacts found with the remains were difficult to date.

The discovery of the stone tool at Kale Tepe now supports the revised age for the skull fragments.

Speaking to  Mail Online, Professor Schreve said: 'When the flake was struck, it would have had razor-sharp edges and presumably been used, as we know other flakes were, for cutting hides, meat or even plant materials.

'There are a handful of sites in southern Europe - Spain, Italy and southern France - that have produced artefacts dating to around 1.2 million years. 

'However, the dating of these sites is very controversial in many cases, or the stone tools are not clearly associated with the dated deposits, which makes it difficult to make meaningful observations as to the timing and route of dispersal of early humans. 

'The key point regarding the new flake from Turkey is that it comes from river sediments that are sandwiched between volcanic deposits, which can be securely dated using two very robust methods, Argon-Argon dating and palaeomagnetism. 

'Western Turkey is an important area as a gateway to Europe so this is secure confirmation, for the first time, of early humans in this area.'

The scientists said the stone tool showed no sign erosion that would suggest it had been transported by the river, leading them to conclude it had been dropped in sediment beside the river by whoever made it

The world's oldest stone tools are thought to be 2,600 sharp-edged flakes found in a dry riverbed of the Afar region of Ethiopia that date to around 2.6 million years ago.

As these tools predate the oldest known Homanin remains, it remains unknown who made them.

However, fossilised bones bearing cut marks inflicted by stone tools have been discovered in Ethiopia, and were dated at 3.4 million years old.

This suggests that Australopithecus afarensis - the same species as the human ancestor Lucy - were using stone tools and eating meat.

Professor Schreve added: 'The flake was an incredibly exciting find.

'I had been studying the sediments in the meander bend and my eye was drawn to a pinkish stone on the surface.

'When I turned it over for a better look, the features of a humanly-struck artefact were immediately apparent.

'By working together with geologists and dating specialists, we have been able to put a secure chronology to this find and shed new light on the behaviour of our most distant ancestors."
