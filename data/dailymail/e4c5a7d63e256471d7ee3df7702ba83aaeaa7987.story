It wasn’t quite one of the gruelling 75-minute work-outs Robin van Persie has warned his Manchester United team-mates about, but Louis van Gaal was still his usual uncompromising self as Holland trained on Friday.

Van Persie frightened a few in the Old Trafford dressing room this week when he described how Van Gaal would be on their backs every minute during ‘enormously intense’ training sessions.

But on the evidence of the final Dutch practice before Saturday night's World Cup warm-up with Ghana, it will be some of his more unorthodox techniques that will unsettle them.

There was an entertaining game of head
 tennis in which three groups of seven - holding hands in a circle - 
must race from byline to half-way line without allowing the ball to 
drop.

Unfortunately, the 
circle nearest to Van Gaal weren’t especially good and every time the 
ball hit the ground, he would despatch them unceremoniously back to the 
start with an outstretched finger and a look of disdain.

During
 a 40-minute small-sided game, it was imperative that Van Gaal’s team - 
containing former Liverpool striker Dirk Kuyt, now at Fenerbahce, and 
Newcastle United goalkeeper Tim Krul - won.

A
 whistle permanently resting between his lips, he pointed, prodded and 
posed searching questions until they finally got their act together and 
scored the decisive goals.

At
 one point, Feyenoord centre back Terence Kongolo turned away from his 
manager, wincing with pain, and poured cold water down his shorts.

The
 agony wasn’t inflicted by Van Gaal - not on this occasion - but the 
must-win mentality clearly stretches down to even the smallest of games.

When
 not snapping and snarling, Van Gaal stood aloof in one of two default 
stances. The one with the arms folded and the one with the hands plunged
 deep in his pockets.

Both, 
allied with a stern and unchanging expression, leave it clear that this 
is a meticulous coach who sees everything and demands the highest 
standards.

There was 
delegation for the warm-ups, to assistants Patrick Kluivert and Danny 
Blind, but once Van Gaal strode up, there was no doubting who was in 
charge.

There was some fun,
 too, but only at the very end. When Kuyt and Co finally emerged 
victors, Van Gaal lined them up in celebratory pose and pretended to 
take a picture of them.

It 
was probably more of a show for the 5,000-strong crowd - the vast 
majority kitted out in oranje, naturally - who had gathered at the De 
Kuip for a public training session.

Van
 Gaal was cheered to the echo whenever he kicked a ball and the 
consensus was that he’s perhaps leaving for England too soon.

But that opinion may change if Holland fail to advance beyond a tricky World Cup group containing Spain, Chile and Australia.

Their
 form hasn’t been great since completing qualification unbeaten with a 
2-0 win over Turkey back in October, the subsequent friendlies 
comprising of draws with Japan, Colombia and Ecuador, and a defeat to 
France.

Van Gaal will cut 
his 29-man provisional squad - reduced after Rafael van der Vaart pulled
 out with a calf injury -  to 23 on Monday, so the Ghana match is a last
 chance to impress.

He will 
reshuffle his team, with Van Persie leading a three-pronged attack 
alongside Wesley Sneijder and Arjen Robben, and Swansea’s Jonathan De 
Guzman in midfield.

Van 
Gaal has been here before and not prospered. He was in charge when 
Ireland beat them to qualification for the 2002 finals and Kuyt believes
 that failure is his primary motivation.

He told De Telegraaf: ‘The disappointment of 2001 has made him stronger. He will do anything to achieve success this time.

‘I
 think Van Gaal is a very experienced top trainer who knows exactly what
 is required to perform in Brazil. He knows exactly what he wants and 
has been a champion in many different countries.’
