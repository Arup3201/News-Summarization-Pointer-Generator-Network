New SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has warned her party could hold the 'balance of power' after the next general election.

In those circumstances, Ms Sturgeon said the SNP would 'never ever' do a deal that would put the Conservatives into power if they failed to win an overall majority in the UK parliament.

The SNP leader said her party could enter into a potential coalition with Labour if they agreed to deliver 'real powers' for the Scottish Parliament.

The party would also have to bring an end to austerity cuts and scrap the Trident nuclear missile system in Scotland.

Ms Sturgeon said her party would 'never ever' do a deal that would put the Conservatives into power, but would consider an alliance with Labour if they agreed on 'real powers' for the Scottish Parliament

Ms Sturgeon, who becomes Scotland's first female first minister in four days' time, was delivering her first conference speech  today since succeeding Alex Salmond as SNP leader.

She used the address to set out her key commitments for the 2016 Holyrood elections, but made her comments on the rival parties with the Westminster general election less than six months away.

Ms Sturgeon, speaking in the conference in Perth, said: 'Scotland could well hold the balance of power in a Westminster parliament with no overall majority.

'If that happens, I promise our country this: you won't need to have voted Labour to keep the Tories out, because that's what we'll do.

'My pledge to Scotland today is simple - the SNP will never, ever, put the Tories into government. '

In her speech, she also appealed to supporters of other parties to back the SNP in May's general election, in a bid to force Westminster leaders to deliver on the vow they made of substantial new powers for Holyrood in the run-up to the referendum.

She said the referendum campaign had 'revitalised this country' and added: 'We will not let Westminster drag us back to business as usual.'

Ms Sturgeon added: 'The only language Westminster really understands is that of power.

'So let them hear this message from all around our country. Power over Scotland no longer rests in the corridors of Westminster.

'In Scotland, today, power rests with the Scottish people - and that is where it will stay.'

The new SNP leader continued: 'The first test of that new democratic order is the general election next May.

'Be under no illusion - if we vote for Westminster parties, they will go back to business as usual.

'The promise of more powers will evaporate. The vow will be broken.

'It was the power of our votes that forced them to make that vow. And it is only the power of our votes that will force them to keep it.'

Meanwhile, Ms Sturgeon put out ambitious plans for a massive extension of free childcare at the heart of her campaign to win the next Scottish elections.

She promised to almost double the amount of care parents can receive for their children at no cost.
