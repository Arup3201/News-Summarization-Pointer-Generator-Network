Samsung has teased a range of new products that it will unveil at next week’s Consumer Electronics Show.

This includes two speakers that offer high quality audio - no matter what direction it is facing.

The speakers use ‘breakthrough’ Ring Radiator technology, which the Korean firm claims allows ‘sound to flow in a 360-degree radius’.

Samsung is set to unveil the two new speakers - called WAM7500 (left) and WAM6500 (right - at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas next week. They use ‘breakthrough’ Ring Radiator technology, which the Korean firm claims allows ‘sound to flow in a 360-degree radius’

Samsung also said this technology creates the perfect balance between treble and bass - but did not reveal more about how its proprietary version of the technology works.

The two speakers are called WAM7500 and WAM6500, and both claim to fill entire rooms with sound.

The former is a stand-type speaker, which means it is typically fixed to one location, while the latter is a portable version with a built-in battery.

Both are Bluetooth enabled, and can be connected to TVs, mobiles, tablets and soundbars.

Speakers typically produce sound using an electromagnet that moves a cone to create sound waves.

Drivers are then used to translate electrical signals into physical vibrations that produce the sound.

These include a tweeter, which creates a high frequency, a midrange, and a woofer which creates low frequencies.

A dome tweeter is made using a voice coil attached to the dome, with a front plate connected to the magnet. As a result, they usually direct sound in limited directions.

In a ring radiator, however, the cone or dome is suspended, which means there are less restrictions on which direction the sound can travel and flow. 

‘We know how much people love music and that’s why we are expanding our portfolio to bring high-quality, wireless audio into the home,’ said Jurack Chae, senior vice president at Samsung Electronics.

‘With the new WAM7500/6500 people can enjoy a vibrant sound wherever they are.’

Samsung’s WAM range isn’t the first to offer this type of sound coverage, and they will rival Ultimate Ear’s Boom speaker, for example.

These are powered by two 1.5-inch (3.8cm) drivers on each side of the speaker, and are paired with 2-inch (5cm) radiators, designed to improve the bass.
