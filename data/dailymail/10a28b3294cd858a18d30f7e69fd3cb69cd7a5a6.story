As the nation reflects
 on the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., an audiotape of an interview 
with the civil rights leader discovered in a Tennessee attic sheds new 
light on a famous phone call John F. Kennedy made to King's wife more 
than 50 years ago.

Historians generally agree 
that Kennedy's phone call to Coretta Scott King expressing concern over 
her husband's arrest in October 1960 - and Robert Kennedy's work behind 
the scenes to get King released - helped JFK win the White House that 
fall.

King himself, while appreciative, wasn't
 as quick to credit the Kennedys alone with getting him out of jail, 
according to a previously unreleased portion of the interview with the 
civil rights leader days after Kennedy's election.

Historians generally agree that Kennedy's phone call to Coretta Scott King expressing concern over her husband's arrest in October 1960 helped him get elected, but rediscovered audio of MLK credits 'many others' as well

'The
 Kennedy family did have some part ... in the release,' King says in the
 recording, which was discovered in 2012. 'But I must make it clear 
that many other forces worked to bring it about also.'

A
 copy of the original recording will be played for visitors at the 
National Civil Rights Museum in Memphis for a 'King Day' event on Jan. 
20.

King was arrested a few weeks before the 
presidential election at an Atlanta sit-in. Charges were dropped, but 
King was held for allegedly violating probation for an earlier traffic 
offense and transferred to the Georgia State Prison in Reidsville, Ga. 

The
 Kennedys intervened, and King was released. Their intervention won the 
support of black voters who helped give Kennedy the winning edge in 
several key states.

Despite their help, however, King was careful not to give them too much credit.

'I
 think Dr. King was aware in the tape that he probably did more for John
 F. Kennedy than perhaps John F. Kennedy did for him,' said Keya Morgan,
 a New York-based collector and expert on historical artifacts. Morgan 
acquired the reel-to-reel audiotape from Chattanooga, Tenn., resident 
Stephon Tull, who discovered it while cleaning out his father's attic.

John F. Kennedy did some behind the scenes work to help release Martin Luther King Jr. from prison

Raymond
 Winbush, director of the Institute for Urban Research at Maryland's 
Morgan State University, said Kennedy's call to King's wife was 
political in nature because the Kennedys had been slow to get involved 
in the civil rights movement.

He said John 
Kennedy didn't actually commit to the movement until a few months before
 his assassination when civil rights leader Medgar Evers was gunned down
 by a Klansman outside his Jackson, Miss., home just after midnight on 
June 12, 1963.

The slaying came hours after 
JFK's television speech in support of civil rights and helped propel the
 struggle for equality to national attention.

'There
 were a lot of black folks who ... weren't fully committed to his 
campaign,' said Winbush, who is also a historian and psychologist. 'That
 call he made to Coretta moved black folks.'

He
 said King's comments on the tape were measured because he probably 
didn't want to offend black supporters, like the NAACP, that had also 
aided him.

'He kind of went in the middle,' Winbush said.

Some believe that Kennedy's call to Corretta King was only  a ploy to get black voters because the Kennedy;s were slow to join in on the civil rights movement

Tull,
 the Chattanooga man who discovered the tape, said his father had 
planned to write a book about the racism he encountered growing up in 
Chattanooga and later as an adult. Tull said his dad, an insurance 
salesman, interviewed King when he visited the city, but never completed
 the book and just stored the recording with some other interviews he 
had done. Tull's father is now in his late 80s and under hospice care. 
Tull has asked that his father not be identified.

In
 the recording, King also discusses his definition of nonviolence, his 
visit to Africa and the impact of the civil rights movement.

'I
 am convinced that when the history books are written in future years, 
historians will have to record this movement as one of the greatest 
epochs of our heritage,' he said. 

'I am convinced that when the history books are written in future years, historians will have to record this movement as one of the greatest epochs of our heritage,' said King in the rediscovered recording

After Morgan
 acquired the tape, he sold it to magician David Copperfield, who then 
donated it to the National Civil Rights Museum to promote King's message
 of nonviolence.

Copperfield said King inspired people to dream.

'That's
 too important for one person to possess,' Copperfield said of the 
recording. 'You have to share that with people to remind as many people 
as possible of the message.'

Barbara Andrews, 
the museum's director of education, said she's pleased the museum's 
visitors will get a chance to hear the recording, which will be among 
the exhibits at the newly-renovated facility scheduled to fully open in 
April.

'It's so powerful for us to be able to 
hear Dr. King in his own words again so many years after his death,' 
Andrews said. 'And I think for our visitors to be able to hear him say 
these words again will resonate in ... a way that we could not convey 
third person.'
