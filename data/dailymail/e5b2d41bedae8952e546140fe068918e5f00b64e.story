A family was handed a £400 parking charge for taking too long to eat their Christmas lunch at a pub. 

Tina Hoskins and 23 of her relatives descended on the Brewers Fayre in Bristol for their annual festive meal in December. 

The family left the pub after spending around three hours there, having waited more than 45 minutes for their pre-booked food.

Later Mrs Hoskins, 34, and three others in the party were sent a letter ordering them to pay £60 for overstaying their welcome in the pub's car park where vehicles are limited to three hours. 

If not paid within two weeks, the family was told charges would increase to £100 per car. 

'I was livid when the bill came through,' said Mrs Hoskins, a teacher.

'I am outraged that they can charge you to park, especially considering the amount the party spent.

'I will not be paying this parking fine as I believe it to be a disgrace. Instead I will advise my family of a more friendly establishment for next year.'

The family later learned the pub insists that customers using their parking facilities give a note of their registration number to bar staff on arrival. 

But Mrs Hoskins said she was never made aware of such rules, and that the family were only there for three hours as their food had taken so long to prepare. 

'My youngest son was very tired, so we asked for chips quickly so he could eat before he fell asleep.

'However, they took an extremely long time and he fell asleep. The food for everyone was served at around 1pm. Then after my son woke up, he had chips before we left.

'It was lovely to see the family, but this meal has now been ruined by parking fines.'  

'If the food had been on time, none of us would have exceeded the three-hour time limit.'

Brewers Fayre has decided not to pursue the charges, and said it would welcome the family back. 

The pub in Bristol said it asked customers to enter their registration numbers upon arrival to enforce the rules

The pub in Bristol said it would not be pursuing the charges issued to the family, and would welcome them back in the future

'We were sorry to hear about the car parking fines faced by Ms Hoskins and her party while visiting the Bristol Concord Brewers Fayre in early December,' a spokesman told MailOnline.

'Whilst there is signage in the shared car park – which is managed by a third party - as well as our restaurant, which clearly states the maximum length of stay and also highlights the option to sign-up for a further two hours of free parking for our guests, we appreciate this is a substantial fine that has marred an otherwise enjoyable dining experience. 

'With this in mind, in this particular instance we would like to cover the cost of the fines as a gesture of goodwill to the party and look forward to welcoming them back to the restaurant in 2015. 

Experts have warned against unsolicited parking fines and charges brought by private companies.

According to Money Supermarket, such letters are not enforceable fines but mere invoices. 

'If you get an unfair private ticket, DON'T just pay it!' advice on the company's website reads.

'Trying to reclaim cash already paid isn't easy, so it's far easier to dispute it. Beating an unfair ticket isn't an exact science.

'These companies have no official right to fine you, though they may try to make you think they do.

'All they're doing is sending you a notice for what they deem to be a breach of contract.'
