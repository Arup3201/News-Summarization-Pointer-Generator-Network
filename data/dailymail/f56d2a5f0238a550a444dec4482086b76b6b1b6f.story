It has long been thought that warmer climes are good for our health.

But a new study suggests that retiring abroad may not make as much difference as you thought.

US researchers have found you're more likely to die of a heart attack in winter regardless of the climate.

Retiring to a warm climate does not reduce your risk of a heart attack. New research has found you're more likely to die of a heart attack in winter, regardless of the climate

They looked at the death rates across warmer and cooler parts of America and found very little difference.

The researchers, from the Good 
Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles, analysed four years of death certificate data from 
seven states with different climates: California, Texas, Arizona, Georgia, Washington, Pennsylvania and 
Massachusetts.

Arizona, for example, is considered to have a warmer winter climate than somewhere chillier such as Massachusetts.

For the years studied, in 
all areas, the total deaths as well as circulatory deaths (i.e. heart and stroke-related
deaths)  rose an average of 26-36 per cent during the winter compared to the summer.

What surprised the researchers was 
that seasonal patterns of total and cardiac deaths were very similar in 
the seven different climate patterns.

It was thought colder weather would increase the risk of a heart attack, but researchers found no evidence of this

No matter where the figures were from, the pattern was the same: many more deaths in the winter than in the summer.

‘This was surprising because climate was thought to be the primary determinant of seasonal variation in death rates,’ said Bryan Schwartz, lead author of the study. 

'We thought colder climates with a colder winter might have a higher increase [in heart attacks] in the wintertime or a prolonged increase in the wintertime, but that's not what we found.'

Because low temperatures have often been linked with increased death rates, the researchers thought the winter peak would be more prominent in cold climates like Massachusetts, added Dr Schwartz, now a cardiology fellow at the University of New Mexico.

'But the death rates were similar. That means that temperature is a small factor - or not a factor at all.'

The research was not designed to show why heart-related death rates rose across the board in the winter.

But Dr Schwartz suggested that people may 'acclimate to their local climate,' making the change between summer and winter temperatures more important than how low the temperature dips in winter.

Flu season - which peaks in the winter - is another factor, he added. Higher rates of respiratory infection have also been shown to raise the risk of death from a heart-related issue, which reinforces the importance of flu vaccines.
