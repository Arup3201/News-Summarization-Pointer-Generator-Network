Burglars who break into country homes can expect to be shot at by their victims, a judge warned yesterday.

Judge Michael Pert QC spoke out after a lawyer demanded leniency for a career criminal who he claimed had been blasted with a shotgun in ‘a form of summary justice’.

The judge replied: ‘If you burgle a house in the country where the householder owns a legally held shotgun, that is the chance you take. You cannot come to court and ask for a lighter sentence because of it.’

The case reignited the debate over the rights of homeowners to defend their properties from intruders.

Daniel Mansell, 33, and Joshua 
O’Gorman, 27, were sentenced to four years in prison following the 
masked raid on the cottage in Welby, near Melton Mowbray, 
Leicestershire.

Their victims, Andy and Tracey Ferrie, were arrested after Mr Ferrie opened fire on the pair during the midnight break-in.

They were held on suspicion of causing
 grievous bodily harm and spent 40 hours in custody before prosecutors 
decided they had acted in ‘reasonable self-defence’ and lifted the 
threat of charges.

The couple emigrated to Australia on 
Monday amid fears of a revenge attack. Cannabis addict Mansell was shot 
in the right hand while O’Gorman was shot in the face during the 
incident earlier this month.

Both men were out of prison on licence when they struck at the Ferries’ 200-year-old rented home.

Judge Pert backed householders’ rights
 to defend their home from intruders, telling Mansell and O’Gorman: ‘I 
make it plain that, in my judgment, being shot is not mitigation.

'You cannot come to court and ask for a lighter sentence because of it.’

He spoke out after Andrew Frymann, 
defending O’Gorman, suggested his client’s ‘near death experience’ 
should be ‘taken into consideration’ by the judge when sentencing.

Mr Frymann said O’Gorman had suffered 
serious facial injuries including permanent scarring. He added: ‘He was 
shot – without any warning or foresight – in the face with a shotgun.

'This is a form of summary justice or punishment which I submit should be taken into consideration.’

Leicester Crown Court yesterday heard 
Mansell and O’Gorman fled empty-handed from the cottage and were 
arrested hours later when they went to hospital for treatment.

'Their injuries were clearly visible 
as they stood in the dock. Mansell – who has a tattoo reading ‘Big Man’ 
on his neck – wore his arm in a sling, and O’Gorman has a scar from his 
right eye to his ear.

Alan Murphy, prosecuting, said the 
Ferries were woken by the sound of breaking glass as the raiders forced 
their way into their home with a garden fork handle.

As they made their way downstairs, Mrs
 Ferrie, the registered keeper of the shotgun, handed the weapon to her 
husband. Mr Murphy said: ‘Mr Ferrie described seeing three men in the 
hall or kitchen wearing some form of face coverings.

‘One of the men was reaching into a drawer that held a number of knives. As a result Mr Ferrie fired his shotgun.’

Mr Ferrie, 35, who owns a motorhome repair business, then called the police, and he and his 43-year-old wife were arrested.

O’Gorman had 16 previous convictions 
involving 27 offences. He was on licence at the time he broke into the 
cottage, having been released early from a 14-month prison sentence for 
dangerous driving.

Mansell has eight previous convictions
 involving 19 offences. He was freed on licence following a conviction 
for causing grievous bodily harm.

Mansell and O’Gorman, both of Leicester, admitted burglary with intent to steal.

Last night Mrs Ferrie’s mother, Hazel 
Towell, 63, said the couple had moved to Perth in Western Australia 
because they feared for their safety.

The retired cashier, from Burton, Staffordshire, added: ‘They’ve moved as far away as possible.

The fear was real enough for Andrew 
and Tracey to stay in a different hotel every night until they flew to 
Australia on Monday. They felt safer if they moved around.’

Tory MP Alan Duncan spoke in defence 
of the Ferries, his constituents, while the couple were in custody. 
Yesterday he welcomed the judge’s robust comments.

‘Three cheers for the judge,’ he said.
 ‘Justice has been swift in this case and draws a clear distinction 
between the culprits and the victims.’

Two other men, aged 23 and 31, who 
were also arrested on suspicion of aggravated burglary, are set to 
answer police bail next month.

The burglars pleaded guilty to the burglary. The judge said their injuries could not form part of their sentence or defence
