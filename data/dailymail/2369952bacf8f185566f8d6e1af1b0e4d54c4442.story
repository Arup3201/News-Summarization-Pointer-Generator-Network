DJ Neil Fox has today been charged with a string of sex offences, including indecent assault on a girl under the age of 14.

Police have charged the former Pop Idol judge, known as Doctor Fox, with nine offences involving six alleged victims, three of whom were allegedly aged under 16 at the time.

Lawyers for the 53-year-old, from Fulham, south west London, today said he 'categorically denies' all the allegations.

It comes following his arrest in September last year, then again in December and earlier this month.

In a statement, Anthony Burton said: 'It is wholly inappropriate at this stage for Mr Fox to make any comment, save that he categorically denies each and every allegation that has been made against him.'

The charges relating to the three girls are alleged to have taken place between 1991 and 1996. The other three women were allegedly attacked by Fox between 2003 and 2014.

Mr Fox, who is currently suspended from his regular slot at Magic FM, was first arrested in connection with the inquiry at the radio studios in September last year, before being taken to a central London police station.

The DJ was arrested again in December over three alleged sexual assaults involving different women.

Scotland Yard said he was arrested again earlier this month after voluntarily attending Charing Cross police station in London in connection with an alleged sexual assault against another victim. This offence is said to have happened in the early 1990s.

Mr Fox has now been charged with one count of indecent assault on a female aged under 14 and two counts of indecent assault on females aged under 16.

In relation to the more recent allegations, he is charged with four counts of indecent assault on a female over 16 and two counts of sexual assault on females. 

A Scotland Yard spokesman added that the charges had not been brought as part of Operation Yewtree - the high profile probe into alleged sexual offences sparked by the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Police said Mr Fox will appear on bail at Westminster Magistrates' Court on April 16.

Mr Fox, who is known by nicknames 'Doctor Fox' and 'Foxy, started his career in local radio before moving the Radio Luxembourg and later Capital FM.

There he presented in a number of slots, rising to fame as a DJ in the early 1990s. In 1993 he was given the job of hosting the Pepsi Network Chart on Sunday afternoon.

The Top 40 show soared in popularity and at one time had a bigger audience than its Radio 1 rival.

He was later rumoured to have been offered the coveted breakfast slot on Radio 1, following the departure of Chris Evans.

Fox went on to present a Channel 5 TV show based around the Pepsi Top 40 Chart and has won numerous awards throughout his career.

But he is perhaps best known as one of the judges on Pop Idol, a forerunner of X Factor, alongside Simon Cowell, Pete Waterman and Nicki Chapman.

The series ran on ITV from 2001 to 2003 and set the format of TV talent shows based on audience voting for the next decade.

Two years later Fox took the breakfast show chair on 105.4 Magic FM and has remained there ever since.
