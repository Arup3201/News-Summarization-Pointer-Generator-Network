Attorney General Eric Holder called on states to temporarily pause death penalty executions on Tuesday, until the Supreme Court decides a case about the controversial drug cocktails used for lethal injects in some states.

The Supreme Court plans on hearing a case brought up by death row inmates in Oklahoma, who believe the midazolam-based drug cocktail used by the state is a breach of their constitutional protection from 'cruel and unusual punishment'. 

The death penalty has long been controversial but became an even bigger issue last year with the botched execution of Oklahoma prisoner Clayton Lockett who writhed in pain and clenched his teeth during the 45 minutes it took for him to die from an injection last year.

Holder, who will be retiring once his replacement is confirmed, has long opposed the death penalty since it presents the 'inevitable' risk of killing an innocent person.

'Our system of justice is the best in the world. It is comprised of men and women who do the best they can, get it right more often than not, substantially more right than wrong,' Holder said at a Tuesday luncheon at the National Press Club. 'There's always the possibility that mistakes will be made ... It's for that reason that I am opposed to the death penalty.'

Pending: On Tuesday, the Florida Supreme Court voted to stay the execution of death row inmate Jerry Correll, pending the U.S. Supreme Court's decision about Oklahoma's drug cocktail 

'I think fundamental questions about the death penalty need to be asked. And among them, the Supreme Court's determination as to whether or not lethal injection is consistent with our Constitution is one that ought to occur,' Holder continued. 'From my perspective, I think a moratorium until the Supreme Court made that determination would be appropriate.'  

Since Oklahoma uses the same drug combination as other states who enforce the death penalty, the Supreme Court's decision could influence death row practices across the nation. 

Indeed, Holder's comments came the same day that the Florida State Supreme Court voted to stay the execution of  prisoner Jerry Correll because the state's lethal drug combination is similar to Oklahoma.

'If use of midazolam as the first drug in a three-drug lethal injection protocol is determined to be cruel and unusual — and therefore unconstitutional — then Florida's precedent approving the use of midazolam and the current Florida three-drug protocol will be subject to serious doubt as to its continuing viability,' the court wrote in their decision. 

'Without a stay of execution in this case, Florida risks the unconstitutional execution of Correll, for which there is no remedy.'

Correll, 59, went to the home of his former mother-in-law, Mary Lou Hines, in June 1985. 

He was convicted of killing Hines, his ex-wife Susan Correll, her sister Marybeth Jones and the former couple's 5-year-old daughter.

The three women were each stabbed at least 14 times, and the girl was stabbed at least 10. Prosecutors said bloody fingerprints and palm prints, along with other physical evidence, linked Correll to the crime scene.

The Florida Supreme Court has previously reviewed the use of midazolam and found it to be effective at rendering the condemned unconscious before the second and third drugs are used to paralyze inmates and then stop their hearts.

Opponents of the procedure say that midazolam doesn't prevent inmates from suffering during an execution.

Unsafe? Oklahoma death row prisoner Clayton Lockett was killed in a botched execution in April this year

Midazolam has been used in problematic executions in Arizona, Ohio and Oklahoma. Florida has used the drug in 11 executions with no apparent problems.

Florida Justices Ricky Polston and Charles Candady said in the dissenting opinion that Florida's circumstances are different than Oklahoma's and that the Florida Supreme Court reviewed an exhaustive amount of material to determine that midazolam is constitutional.

'Whatever the majority's speculation about how the Supreme Court may alter the law in the future, this Court should follow our precedent as it exists today,' they said in the dissent.

Oklahoma and Florida, uses midazolam as one of three drugs in lethal injection executions.

The second drug serves to paralyze the inmate and the third one is used to stop his heart. 

In 2008, the justices upheld the use of a different three-drug combination in a case from Kentucky and set a high bar for challenges to lethal injections. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote then that the court probably would not stop executions unless 'the condemned prisoner establishes that the state's lethal injection protocol creates a demonstrated risk of severe pain.'

What has changed since 2008 is that states have been forced to change the drugs they use in executions after drug manufacturers took steps to ensure their products are not used in executions.

The inmates are trying to stop their executions, arguing that the state would essentially be experimenting on them by injecting them with unproven and untested drugs.

'The drug protocol in Oklahoma is not capable of producing a humane execution, even if it is administered properly,' Baich said.

Last April, Oklahoma used midazolam for the first time in a grisly procedure. Inmate Clayton Lockett clenched his teeth, moaned and writhed on the gurney before a doctor noticed a problem with the intravenous line and the execution was called off. Lockett died 43 minutes after the procedure began.

Oklahoma revamped its procedures in response to the Lockett execution, including a fivefold increase in the amount of midazolam used. In last week's execution, Warner showed no signs of physical distress.
