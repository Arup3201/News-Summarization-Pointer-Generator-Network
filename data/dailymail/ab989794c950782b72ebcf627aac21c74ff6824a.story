Miss Piggy is finally joining her love, Kermit the Frog, in the Smithsonian Institution's collection of legendary puppeteer Jim Henson's Muppets.

Henson's family donated more than 20 puppets and props Tuesday to the National Museum of American History to accompany the earlier donations of Kermit, Oscar the Grouch and early Henson creations.

The newest donation includes Miss Piggy and some of her co-stars from The Muppet Show, including Fozzie Bear, Rowlf the piano-playing dog, Scooter and the Swedish Chef. Puppets from Sesame Street joining the museum collection include Bert and Ernie, Elmo, Cookie Monster, Grover and Count Von Count, among others.

The food and frog loving Miss Piggy began as a minor character on the Jim Henson's The Muppet Show (1976).

Miss Piggy's first television appearance was on a Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass Band special.

As her story goes, Miss Piggy is a native Iowan, though she occasionally takes on a slight French accent.

Miss Piggy's big break from background character to starring role came when a 'starlet character' was needed on an episode of The Muppet Show.

Bonnie Erickson, who designed many of the famous Muppets and now serves as executive director of the Jim Henson Legacy explained to Smithsonian Magazine how Miss Piggy became star.

'We quickly ran to the eye drawer, got some very big eyes with long eyelashes and changed her wig,' he said, 'and I draped some fabric for a dress and put some pearls around her neck.'

Many of the puppets are among the first constructions of the characters.

Smithsonian
magazine welcomed Miss Piggy, dressed in a silver evening gown and 
holding a red rose, with a photo shoot. The museum allowed her to pose 
with Dorothy's ruby slippers from ‘The Wizard of Oz’ and to wear the 
real 45-carat Hope Diamond from the National Museum of Natural History.

‘She
was very well-behaved, considering she wanted to take it home with 
her,’ said Bonnie Erickson, who created the Miss Piggy puppet with 
Henson and now is executive director of the Jim Henson Legacy 
foundation.

The gift was made on what would have been Henson's 77th birthday and shortly after his wife, Jane Henson, died in April.

Since
she was diagnosed with cancer four years ago, Jane Henson spent years 
planning to find permanent homes for each puppet character, Cheryl 
Henson said. Other puppets will be donated to the Museum of the Moving 
Image in Astoria, New York, and to the Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta.

‘Many
of these puppets have been in boxes for years. They've been tucked away
in boxes, and we don't want them to stay in boxes. We want people to 
see them and to appreciate them,’ Cheryl Henson said. ‘There's something
about puppets. They're not animated. ... They are actual, physical 
things.’

Miss Piggy 
will go on display in March 2014 in the Smithsonian's ‘American Stories’
exhibit. The original Kermit and Cookie Monster will go on view in 
November in a special display case, and a puppetry exhibit in early 2014
will likely feature Bert and Ernie, among others, curators said.

The Hensons have a longtime connection to Washington. Jim and Jane Henson met as students at the nearby University of Maryland and became performing partners before they married. They made early television commercials with their puppets and created a local TV show, ‘Sam and Friends,’ which included the first Kermit creation.

The original Kermit, made from an old coat and pingpong balls for eyes, was donated to the Smithsonian in 2010, along with other characters from ‘Sam and Friends.’

The newest donation includes Boober Fraggle, Red Fraggle and Travelling Matt from the 1980s show ‘Fraggle Rock.’ The Hensons also donated a 1957 puppet called Wilkins that was made for Wilkins Coffee commercials.

Erickson and others who worked with Henson gathered Tuesday at the museum for a donation ceremony and said the Muppets will have a new life among the relics of history. The puppets were never meant to be made for posterity, Erickson said, but ‘considering that they're retired, they're looking absolutely wonderful.’

Fran Brill, the first woman puppeteer Henson hired for ‘Sesame Street,’ who created the characters of Zoe and Prairie Dawn, said Henson had created a puppet family with his many collaborators.

‘I'm just looking at all of these characters and thinking this is the puppet family, and yet, I feel like they're all my relatives,’ she said.

Curator Dwight Blocker Bowers said the puppets represent the creativity of ‘one of America's great innovators.’ He said Henson had extended the boundaries of puppetry, using film and television.

‘I love these puppets' eyes. You can't walk near them without making eye contact,’ Blocker Bowers said. ‘They're very much like an oil painting. And they have such an innocence.’
