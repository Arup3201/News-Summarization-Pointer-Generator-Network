It is better to give than to deceive.

One woman had a short wishlist for Christmas this year and it likely didn't include being pranked for Reddit karma. 

A user going by the name of Jonathan H posted 'My wife wanted jewelry for Christmas....don't think she'll be too happy.'

He added a photo of the gift he bought her, a black box showing off a platinum ring inside.

Prank: A user going by the name of Jonathan H posted 'My wife wanted jewelry for Christmas....don't think she'll be too happy'

Unfortunately for his wife, the jewelry she hoped she was in reality just a platinum-glazed mug handle packaged to look like a ring.

A good deal of Reddit users were not amused by the idea. 'So your new years resolution is to be divorced?' one commenter wrote.

'Ninety-eight percent of Reddit thinks I am going to end up sleeping on the couch,' Jonathan told Huffington Post, saying he actually had a Kate Spade necklace for the real gift.

Those Internet commenters worried about the state of Jonathan's marriage can rest easy, as his wife found the idea funny, Jonathan told MailOnline.com.

'If there's an opportunity to make a joke, I'm going to do it,' he said. 'This year, my 6-year old son wanted golf clubs and his small set was wrapped in Disney princesses, something that, at his age, he refuses to touch.' 

Dad joke: The mug is sold pre-packaged to open up to a platinum-glazed handle designed to fool the recipient

Indignation: Reddit users thought the joke would not go over well, with one commenter saying, 'So your new years resolution is to be divorced? 

Merry pranksters: Another user bought his girlfriend a '3 ct ring' for Christmas, and said she wasn't happy with the joke

Jonathan's wife wasn't the only one suffering through prank gifts on Reddit this holiday, as user vbpatel posted a photo of a ring he bought his girlfriend with three carrots 

'I got my gf a 3ct ring for Christmas,' he wrote. 'She was not happy.'

What at first looks like a platinum ring with a stone inset is actually significantly less glamorous
