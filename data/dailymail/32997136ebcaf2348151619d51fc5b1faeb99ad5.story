The instant camera is set to make a comeback.

Japanese camera maker Fujifilm has unveiled a new camera that prints card-sized photos instantly.

Each time a photo is taken, the printout appears from the top of the camera and, like the infamous Polaroid version, will develop and dry as it hits the air.

Japanese camera maker Fujifilm has unveiled its Instax mini 90 Neo Classic, pictured, that prints card-sized photos instantly. Official pricing information for the UK hasn't been released but it is expected to cost around £135 with a 10-shot film roll priced at around £4.50

The Instax mini 90 Neo Classic can shoot multiple exposures and has shutter speeds up to 1/400 of a second meaning it can be used in a range of lighting conditions.

Fujifilm announced the camera during an event in Tokyo and it will go on sale in Japan on 23 August before being released globally on September 20.

It will cost ¥20,000 in Japan, which converts to around £134, yet official UK prices have not yet been released.

A 10-shot roll of film will cost around ¥700, which would be around £4.55.

Fujifilm was the first company to 
produce film in 1934 and began selling instant cameras during the 1980s 
with its F series, including the F-10 and F-50S.

The technology was first sold commercially by American Scientist Edwin Land, who co-founded the Polaroid corporation.

Speaking
at the event in Tokyo, general manager Fujifilm's photo imaging 
products division, Masato Yamamoto told the Wall Street Journal: 'People crave something real, a physical object that is unique and that you can hold in your hand.

'Film yields an authenticity that is often missing in a digital world.'

Photographer
Mikiya Takimoto added that the technology makes people think more about
the photos they're taking and ultimately makes them better 
photographers.

Fujifilm is hoping the release will restore sales of its instant camera range, which had fallen by 90 per cent in 2002.

Instant camera film has the developing process arranged in 
chemical layers onto each sheet of film.

A chemical reagent made sits in a layer just above the light-sensitive 
layers of the film, but below the image layer.

Before the picture is taken, the 
reagent is collected at the border of the sheet of film.

When the pictures is taken, the film is rolled out of the camera and the reagent is spread into the middle of the sheet and pushed between the layers of the film.

It then moves downward through the laye­rs, changing the 
exposed particles in each layer into metallic silver.

The chemicals dissolve the developer dye so it begins to move up towards the image 
layer.

The metallic silver areas at each layer stick to the dyes and stops them from moving further. 

This means only the dyes and colours needed to make the picture move through the layers to where they are needed. The colours then mix to create a 
translucent green film on the surface of the image.

Light reflects off the 
white pigment in the reagent and shines through the colour layers.

The timing layer slows the reagent down on
its path to the acid layer, to give the film time to develop before it 
is exposed to light.

The stage where the image develops is the final chemical reaction in which an acid layer clears up the 
opacifiers in the reagent so the image is visible.
