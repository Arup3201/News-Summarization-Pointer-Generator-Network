Carley Belmonte, one of the strars of Welsh reality show The Valleys, has given herself an entire body overhaul after Twitter trolls taunted her about her weight.

Just in time for the new series, the star, 22, from Caerphilly, has shifted two inches from her waist and half a stone in weight.

Now a slim size 10, Carley got fit at a military bootcamp and boosted her weight-loss with a £670 fat-freezing treatment, bringing her down to her target.

The young blonde stars in the outrageous show which follows the lives of 
the party-loving inhabitants of south Wales.

But Twitter trolls told Carley she looked like a 'whale', so she was keen to get in shape for the third series, which premiered on 
Tuesday at 10pm on MTV.

She said: 'I've finally hit my target weight and slimmed down my tummy to fit a size 10 dress.

'I've been working hard to change my lifestyle and slim down. I was close to my ideal body shape and the treatment just gave me a nudge in the right direction. It's always hardest to get rid of your tummy fat but I'm amazed by the results, so good!'

She added: 'I feel disgusting when I am overweight. You always get a lot of abuse on Twitter. It affected my self-esteem so much. I am determined to put everything right so I can feel confident about my appearance. And now I don't care what people say. I feel fantastic.'

Carley says following her overhaul she no longer has a muffin top over jeans, nor a pot belly in dresses

Carley went on crash diets after receiving hurtful comments about her figure on Twitter, but none of them worked and afterwards she always regained any weight she might have lost.

It was only after getting healthy diet and fitness advice at No 1 Boot Camp - where she spent a week with with ex-military fitness trainers - that she was able to get down to 9st 9lbs and not put the weight back on.

But she still had a stubborn bit of flabby tummy she was desperate to shift and which would always show when she tried to squeeze herself into size 10 clothes.

But this, she says, has been helped by her fat-freezing treatment, and so she no longer has a muffin- top over tight jeans, nor a visible pot belly in bodycon dresses.

Carley said: 'It's so hard to lose the weight and so easy to put it on. When we are filming I drink most nights and eat rubbish at all the wrong times. But this time I wanted to look and feel great on camera. The weight loss has been amazing. I'm feeling good and I'm determined to keep the weight off.'

She added: 'I'd really recommend it to anyone wanting to get rid of those last few inches. It's quick and easy. I'm thinking of having it done again, on my hips this time.

'Now people are jealous of my amazing weight loss. My weight fluctuates massively - on a bad week, I can put on 5lbs - so I have to be very careful. But at the moment I'm happy.'

Incorporating elements of her strict regime into her new and improved lifestyle, Carley is now enjoying boxercise classes and a healthy diet.

'No more pizza!' she said.

'I have developed exercise regimes which work for me and I can see the benefits of a low-fat diet. I drink loads of water too. I really want to stay on track.'

And the impressive results of her Lipoglaze treatment are keeping her focused.

She said: 'I've got into all sorts of good habits and Lipoglaze has made me look even better. The results have been really quick too and it's given me a real boost. I'm never going to be super skinny, but I am comfortable with my body image now and that's only going to get better!'

The 60-minute non-invasive treatment carried
 out at the LoveLite clinic banishes more than a third of the fat from 
the target area and is safe, painless and has no after-effects.

It
 works by freezing the area up to minus 10 degrees Centigrade to kill off the fat
 cells, which then drain away naturally through the body. The full 
effects of the fat reduction are visible after four to eight weeks.
