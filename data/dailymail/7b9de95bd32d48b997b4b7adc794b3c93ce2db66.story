One table is heaving with chargrilled vegetable vol-au-vents, free range egg quiche and salads of rocket, torn chicken breast and cherry tomatoes fresh from the vine, drizzled with lashings of olive oil.

The other boasts shop-bought sausage rolls, cheese puffs, breadsticks, cucumber slices and salad cream, washed down with tins of Boddingtons and cans of cola.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, it was the street party near the constituency home of David and Samantha Cameron that offered the rather more upmarket fare on the third day of celebrations to toast The Queen's Jubilee celebrations.

The couple took their three children to the Jubilee celebration in a quiet cul-de-sac in the Cotswold village of Spelsbury, where delights such as red cabbage coleslaw and homemade mini-pizzas were on offer.

Mrs Cameron, 41, made a beeline for a salad of lamb’s lettuce and crispy bacon, dishing up a portion for her husband, 45, and then herself. Afterwards the couple enjoyed cupcakes iced to look like the St George’s Cross.

The event was in stark contrast to the more colourful street party laid on in the market town of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire.

Union Jack tablecloths, cups, plates and balloons adorned the tables, which were piled with more conventional party snacks such as crisps, dips and ham sandwiches.

These were apparently washed down with tins of Boddingtons bitter, bottles of lager, glasses of white wine and paper cups of fizzy drinks. Guests added to the colourful celebrations by wearing red, white and blue clothes – with some donning masks bearing the faces of members of the Royal Family.

In West Oxfordshire, the party decorations amounted to a few more modest strings of bunting, and diners ignored the tables and chairs in favour of mingling by the gazebos. Spelsbury parish councillor Susan Tolputt, who has lived in the village for 12 years and was one of the event’s organisers, said:  ‘Everyone in the village made something and brought it along, resulting in an amazing display of food.

‘Around 200 people came and although there were tables and chairs, people stood around talking to each other while enjoying the barbecue.

‘It was a wonderful day and it was nice  to see the Camerons because they don’t spend so much time here now they are in Downing Street.’

Nick Clegg, the Deputy Prime Minister, also got in on the act yesterday as he attended a street party in his constituency in Sheffield.

Unlike yesterday, the rain held off this afternoon as Mr Cameron chatted with his constituents in the north Oxfordshire village.

As well as commemorating the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, David Cameron also said the street party hosted by him and the thousands of others like it across Britain were a brilliant showcase of the Big Society in action - which has been panned by critics for lacking real meaning.

The Prime Minister said yesterday: 'We had a great street party, but inside Downing Street rather than outside.

'We
had elderly people, we had Scouts, we had Girl Guides, Brownies, people
who had been organising the Big Lunch. The oldest 96, the youngest was 
four or five, so it was a great Big Society occasion and a real pleasure
to be able to host this.'

The
Prime Minister, who meets the Queen every week to discuss topical 
issues, said it was a 'huge treat' to receive the benefit of her 
'unparalleled' knowledge of world events, which dates back to when 
Winston Churchill was prime minister.

'She is an amazing listener but she also asks some really pertinent questions.'

The original plan was for Mr Cameron to host the Downing Street party outside Number 10, with guests sitting at trestle tables tucking in to Jubilee fare.

A big screen was set up, showing the Royal flotilla, and bunting adorned the front of Number 10 and Number 11.

But with just hours to go until the start of the party, officials decided it was best to invite the 120 guests indoors to enjoy the specially decorated Jubilee cup cakes and sandwiches in the warmth of the Terracotta room.

No 10 spokesperson said: 'To celebrate the Jubilee, and as part of his duties as Prime Minister and an MP, David Cameron attended two street parties, one in Downing Street, the other in his constituency.'

For someone who once described the monarchy as 'our most sordid soap opera', it may have come as some surprise to see Ken Livingstone in the party spirit yesterday.

The former Mayor of London was out on the streets of Brent in the north-west of the capital, where he joined in the jubilee celebrations with the borough's residents.

It certainly seems a change of heart towards the Royal Family since making his views very publicly known in the past.

Is he a royal convert? Former Mayor of London Ken Livingstone greets a resident in Brent, north-west London as he joins in the Jubilee celebrations having previously voiced his distaste for the monarchy

For it was he who released 1,000 black balloons from County Hall back in 1981 to 'mourn' the wedding off Prince Charles and Diana.

And in a newspaper interview in 1996, he referred to the royals as 'our most sordid soap-opera' which had been populated by 'not very bright…airheads in high heels'.

When it was the turn of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to tie the knot, he did at least show some kind of turnaround by calling for free travel for all Londoners to celebrate their happy day last year.

Whether his latest outing represents a full fledged u-turn remains to be seen.
