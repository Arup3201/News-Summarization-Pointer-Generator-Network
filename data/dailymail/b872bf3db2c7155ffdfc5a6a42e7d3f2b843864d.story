Comedian Stephen Colbert opened his TV show last night with a moving tribute to his mother, who died last week age 92.

For three and a half minutes, Colbert pushed aside the conservative blow-hard he played on 'The Colbert Report' and spoke with deep sincerity about Lorna Tuck Colbert.

'If you watch this show, and you like this show, that’s because of everybody who works here and I’m lucky to be one of them,' an emotional Colbert said.

'But when you watch the show, if you also like me, that’s because of my mom.'

Colbert's voice cracked several times as he choked back tears to give the emotional tribute. On several occasions, he had to pause and look down at his desk to keep from openly weeping on camera.

The 49-year-old television personality is the youngest of 11 children Lorna had with her husband James Colbert Jr., a medical school dean who taught at Yale University.

She was the 
matriarch of a family of 85 children, grandchildren and 
great-grandchildren - most of them living in and around Charleston, South 
Carolina.

The Colbert family did not comment on her cause of death. An obituary said she died after a long illness.

Lorna stayed at home and raised the children in Charleston, South Carolina, teaching them love and compassion.

'She made a very loving home for us. No fight between siblings could end without hugs and kisses, although hugs never needed a reason in her house,' he said.

Lorna Colbert trained as an actress and gave her youngest son, Stephen, a flair for the dramatic

Colbert took last week off from taping his comedy news show to mourn his mother, who passed away on June 12.

Colbert's father and two of his brothers were killed in a 1974 commercial plane crash in Charlotte, North Carolina, when Colbert  was just 10.

'I know it may sound greedy to want more days with a person who lived so long, but the fact that my mother was 92 does not diminish, it only magnifies the enormity of the room whose doors have quietly shut,' Colbert said, struggling to maintain his composure.

Lorna was born in Larchmont, New York, in Westchester County in 1920 that same week, Colbert noted, 'as women got the right to vote.'

She met her husband James at age 12 and made her friends cross town to ride their bicycles past his house. But, she refused to even look in his window to see if he had noticed her.

Colbert raised the children, but she took on many other tasks to keep her busy.

Her obituary described her as 'an accomplished artist, a church leader, a businesswoman, a supporter of the arts.'

Colbert may have inherited some of his stage presence from Lorna, who train as an actor.

'Singing and dancing was encouraged except at the dinner table,' he joked.

'She’d trained to be an actress when she was younger and she would teach us to do stage falls by pretending to faint on the kitchen floor.'

In a 2008 interview with a South Carolina TV program, she said she said Stephen was a 'fabulous, wonderful young son.'

She also said she hoped that no one took his conservative persona too seriously - because I didn't match his real personality at all.

Colbert has remained close to his family and his childhood roots in South Carolina. He campaigned for his sister, Elizabeth Colbert Bush, in her losing bid to win a special election for a South Carolina U.S. House seat this fall. 

After his three and a half minute tribute, Colbert paused, looked away - and then turned back to the camera, having re-assumed his TV persona in an instant.

'With that... this is the Colbert Report,' he said
