William Henry Welch, 53, escaped punishment for driving without licence because his wife incorrectly told him he would be covered if he borrowed a friend's car

A star of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding escaped punishment for driving without insurance after his wife checked his documentation as he can 'barely read', a court heard.

William Henry Welch, 53, avoided six penalty points on his driving licence because his wife incorrectly told him he would be covered if he borrowed a friend's car, a court was told.

Welch told Magistrates he asked his wife to look at his documents as he struggles with reading.

He was granted an absolute discharge after admitting driving without insurance at Newton Aycliffe Magistrates' Court.

Welch is a well-known campaigner for traveller and gipsy rights - and has appeared on My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding among other reality shows.

Speaking after the case Welch said: 'It isn’t all doom and gloom when you go to these courts, if you go and you have a reasonable argument the magistrates are willing to listen.

'You should never just give up and think that they won’t listen to you because they will.'

The court heard how Welch’s own car had broken down when he was working in Leominster, Herefordshire, and a friend loaned him a Vauxhall Vectra to drive back home.

Welch told the court he had rung his wife, Rachel, to check he was covered to drive the Vectra.

After reading the insurance policy she told him that he was.

Welch of Darlington, Durham, told the court he left insurance documents to his wife because: 'I can barely read.'

Mrs Welch, 49, told the court: 'We were both named on the insurance document and so I thought we were both policy holders.'

Andrea Milson, prosecuting, told the court that as policyholder, Mrs Welch was covered to drive any car.

However, as Mr Welch was a named driver he was only covered to drive the family car and not the borrowed Vectra.

Welch, a well-known Gypsy campaigner, told the court he asked his wife to look at his documentation as he can 'barely read'. He has starred in numerous television shows including My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding

The car was stopped by police on the A456 in Worcestershire last August and Welch was subsequently charged with driving with no insurance and no MoT.

Welch admitted both charges but, in a rare ‘special reasons hearing’, his solicitor, David Dedman, argued that the licence should not be endorsed with the usual six penalty points.

'This was an honest mistake,' said Mr Dedman.

'He genuinely believed he was insured and was misled by his wife, not deliberately or intentionally.'

Magistrates granted Welch an absolute discharge on the matter of no insurance.

They imposed no penalty points, but he was ordered to pay costs of £85. He was fined a further £100 for the offence of driving a vehicle with no MoT test certificate.

Paddy Doherty walked free from court after headbutting his stepbrother in March

In March, Paddy Doherty, 55,  walked free from court after admitting he headbutted his stepbrother.

The 55-year-old breached the terms of a suspended jail sentence when he committed the assault at a pub in Flintshire, north Wales, in October 2013.

He was given a six-month supervision order  instead of jail time.

The 2011 winner of Celebrity Big Brother had previously been handed a 31-week jail term, suspended for two years, in January 2012, after he brawled in the street with a fellow traveller.

The show's infamous dressmaker Thelma Madine was sued by her head designer for unfair dismissal at the end of 2013.

A court ruled Ms Madine dismissed Leanne Phillips, who was paid £400 a week to design dresses for the Nico Bridal Company, based in Liverpool, after a heated row.

Ms Madine fired the 31-year-old, who she had previously praised with taking her business to 'another level' after six years.
