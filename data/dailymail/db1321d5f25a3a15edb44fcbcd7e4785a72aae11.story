John Lewis, Coca Cola and M&S may be well-known for the Christmas adverts that make us feel warm and fuzzy inside but try watching Boots' offering without shedding a tear. 

FEMAIL can exclusively reveal the store's Christmas campaign, which will be aired on TV during Downton Abbey on Sunday 9, and it's a real tear-jerker. 

As the lights go off at the end of Christmas Day, the advert tells the story of one household for whom the magic is just beginning.

First look: FEMAIL can exclusively reveal Boots' Christmas advert, which tells the story of a family who go to great lengths to make one lady feel very special

It’s just gone midnight and whilst everyone else in the street is heading to bed, one family is preparing a Christmas that a special woman in their life will never forget. 

We see a sleepy husband's alarm going off, a mother and father driving across a snowy town  bundled up from the cold and a young son waiting up on the stairs.

What's going on? The family can be seen waking up in the middle of the night on Christmas Day and wrapping presents while the rest of the neighbourhood sleeps

Where's he heading? Uncle Charlie can be seen walking his dog through the snowy streets carrying a present

What's going on? A daughter carries a present as her boyfriend picks her up and drives her to her father's house

Wait! Another daughter can be seen dashing for the last bus back from the airport after landing from her gap year return flight

Uncle Charlie can be seen walking his dog through the snowy streets, while a daughter rushes for the last bus back from the airport after landing back in London from her gap year.

So what's all the late night activity in aid of? The advert shows the lengths to which one family goes to deliver a surprise Christmas celebration for a nurse who as a mother, daughter, sister and wife makes them feel special every day of the year.

She can be seen leaving her night shift at the hospital and returns home to what she thinks is an empty house. In fact, she is greeted by each and every family member who has made the effort to wake up in the middle of the night and celebrate the Christmas she missed.

The TV spot ends with the strap line ‘Because she’s special'.

Just like the family in the video, Boots UK is inviting the nation to celebrate all of the special people in their lives this Christmas with the launch of the #SpecialBecause campaign.

The beauty giant are encouraging Brits to share the reason why they love a certain someone with the hashtag #SpecialBecause. 

A spokesperson for Boots said: 'We know that for our customers giving the perfect Christmas gift offers much more than just the present itself, it is a way for them to show how much they care. This Christmas we want to inspire our customers to celebrate the special people in their lives, not just by giving the perfect gift from Boots, but by sharing the reasons they matter for the whole nation to see.

'Be it the best friend who always takes your late night phone calls, the brother who’s your babysitting backstop, or the colleague who makes the office cheery, this year at Boots we have a special gift for everyone, from the smallest of stocking fillers to the most luxurious of beauty treats. 

'That’s what #SpecialBecause is all about...making those who make us feel good, often in the smallest or simplest of ways, realise just how special they are.'
