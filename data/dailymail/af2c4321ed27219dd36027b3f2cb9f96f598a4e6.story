Olympic swimming champion Amy Van Dyken-Rouen, whose lower body was left paralyzed in an ATV accident earlier this month, has vowed to walk out of the hospital in August.

Speaking with the Today show from Craig Hospital in Englewood, Colorado, the six-time gold medalist, 41, said she is 'not afraid' of the hard road to recovery that lies ahead.

She revealed she has felt some sporadic sensations below her belly button following surgery, which gives her hope that she may regain some feeling in her legs and eventually be able to walk.

'This is a new challenge, and I'm taking it head-on,' she said in the interview that aired on Friday.

Strong: On the Today show on Friday, Olympic gold medalist Amy Van Dyken-Rouen vowed to walk out of the hospital in August - which will mark just two months since she severed her spine in an ATV accident

'This is more than just for a gold 
medal, this is for my life; our life. And so, I'm here and I'm working 
as hard as I can for that.'

Van Dyken-Rouen severed her spine when an ATV rolled on top of her following dinner with her husband, former Denver Broncos player Tom Rouen, near their home in Show Lo, Arizona on June 6.

The case was so serious that she and Rouen said their goodbyes before she went to surgery. She told him to move on and be happy in his life, while he said he understood if she needed to leave him.

'One of the things that I told her was if... all this was too much and she wanted to go, she could go, and I'd understand,' Rouen recounted to Matt Lauer on the Today show.

Joy: She returned to the pool for the first time since the accident this week and said it made her feel 'normal'

Fighter: Van Dyken-Rouen, 41, goes through physical therapy from 9am until 4pm every day

Battle: She also shared these images showing her pushing herself up off the bed during therapy

But Van Dyken-Rouen, who won four gold medals at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, didn't like that.

'Don't tell me I can't do something,' she told Lauer. 'Don't tell me to give up.'

She woke up from surgery with an unwavering positive attitude that she has shared with thousands of well wishers on Twitter and Instagram.

Since being flown to Colorado, she has started her rehabilitation and works from 9am until 4pm every day. When asked what is the toughest about it, she said: 'Everything.'

But earlier this week, she had some respite when she finally got back in the pool.

'It was the first time I felt quote-unquote normal,' she said. 'This is not normal for me, it will be, but not yet, so I felt normal. I was sculling and my legs were dragging behind me, which they normally would. It was awesome.'

Life-changing: An X-ray shows the break in her spine - if it had been a little higher she would not be able to use her hands. She said she has started to feel sensation in her lower body

Still smiling: Van Dyken-Rouen, pictured arrived at Craig Hospital in Englewood, Colorado on June 18, called the accident 'a set back' that she would get past

She shared photos of the experience on Instagram, showing her being lowered into the water and grinning as she moved along.

Van Dyken-Rouen recounted how she used to be bad at swimming and overcame her challenges
 to break records, and she is now applying the same vigor to her 
rehabilitation.

'I suck at getting out of my chair, just
 like I sucked at swimming,' she said.

'This is a new challenge, I'm not afraid of 
it, I welcome it. This is more than for just a gold medal, this is for my
 life, for our life.'

She added: 'It's a setback; that's all it is. And then we're gonna rock and roll.'

Champion: Van Dyken became the first U.S. woman to win four golds at one Olympics

Lauer questioned her positive attitude, asking her husband if she'd ever broken down - which he said she hadn't. She said she had only really felt emotional and overwhelmed by the outpouring of peoples' love.

'I don't have that in my makeup to sit there and dwell on it,' she said of her attitude. 'Because if I do, I'm going to go down a rabbit hole and it's going to be awful.'
