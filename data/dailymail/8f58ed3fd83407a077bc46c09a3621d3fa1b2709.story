Detectives have yet to release his name to the media

Victim was a man between the age of 40 and 60 years old

Police say they have finally identified the victim, whose severed head was found by two dogwalkers earlier this week  in the hills by the famed Hollywood sign.

However, they have decided not to release his name and have yet to give a reason for that decision.

The grisly discovery was made in the land close to Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's Hollywood Hills mansion, and because the area is often used for filming, the couple who found the head first thought it was a film prop. The area was a location for the original 'Batcave' in the 1960s Batman series starring Adam West.

'Our assumption was that there was always people filming up there, and it was a prop,' said Lauren Kornberg.

'We walked down the ravine and got closer and realized it was a freshly severed human head.'

The head was found 2:30pm on Tuesday in Canyon Drive, when Mrs Kornberg and a friend were walking nine dogs and saw two of the animals playing with an object in a bag.

Investigators do not believe it had been there long calling the head 'fresh'.

Then late on Wednesday night, two hand and two feet were discovered near the city's iconic Hollywood sign.

There are reports today that detectives are questioning a person of interest in connection with the discovery.

Investigators raided a Los Angeles apartment building last night near to where the human remains were found, KFI-AM reported.

Yesterday Arizona police launched a 
joint investigation with the LAPD to determine whether body parts found 
near the Hollywood sign are connected to a dismembered body discovered 
500 miles away.

The torso was found on the side
 of a dirt road west of the Tucson Mountains on January 6, according to 
the Pima County sheriff's office.

The department asked Los Angeles to 'expedite a
 DNA comparison as soon as possible.'

According the the Arizona Daily Star, the dismembered body is that of a male, found by two men cutting grass to feed their animals.

Pima County 
sheriff's Bureau Chief Rick Kastigar told the newspaper the man's head, hands and feet were missing.

However police now believe that the two events may not be connected.

The events have unfolded like a gory movie script, and police are now 
trying to identity the man.

Today more than 100 police 
officers, some on horseback, were searching a Hollywood wilderness park 
along a winding hiking trail to see if they can find yet more body 
parts.

Authorities said the
 head came from a man believed to be 40 to 60 years old. Police think 
all the body parts are from the same man but are trying to confirm that.

A couple walking nine dogs found the 
severed human head inside a plastic bag on Tuesday afternoon after two 
of the dogs began toying with an object.

'One of the dogs ran into the brush and 
came out carrying a plastic grocery bag. As the dogs shook the plastic 
grocery bag the severed human head fell out of the bag and onto the 
ground,' Cmdr. Andrew Smith told KCBS-TV.

The first hand was 
found as dozens of officers and homicide investigators combed the brush,
 and a coroner's cadaver dog came upon it about 50 yards from where the 
head was discovered on Tuesday afternoon, the Los Angeles Times 
reported.The second hand and both feet were found nearby later Wednesday afternoon. No details were immediately available on the condition of the body parts.

The man might have been killed elsewhere in recent days and his body dumped in the park, Cmdr Smith said.

Wild animals in the park may have other body parts, he said.

Police were looking at reports of missing persons, and coroner's investigators were to check dental records to try and determine his identity.

Smith noted that the area is well traveled by both cars and hikers. A paved road winds around picnic areas and a children's playground before connecting with a trail that eventually winds up near the Hollywood sign.

The Hollywood sign on Mount Lee above Los Angeles originally read 'Hollywoodland' and was created to promote a housing development in 1923.

The last few letters deteriorated in the late 1940s and the part that remained was restored in 1978.
