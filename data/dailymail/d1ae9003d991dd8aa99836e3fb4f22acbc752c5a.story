A South Florida sniping training program has been suspended after police were found to be using mug shots of black teenagers for target practice in a discovery that sparked outrage online.

The six pictures, printed out on a single piece of paper and used as targets by North Miami Beach police snipers, were discovered riddled by bullets at a shooting range in Medley in December. 

They featured a number of former convicts, including Woody Deant, then aged 18, who was arrested in connection to a drag race in 2000 that left two people dead. He was released in 2004.

After Florida Army National Guard sergeant Valerie Deant - who coincidentally happens to be Deant's sister - found the targets discarded at the range, she  posted an image of them online.

Targets: A South Florida sniping training program has been suspended after police were found to be using these mug shots of black men (pictured) for target practice in a discovery that sparked outrage online

The picture sparked anger among the online community, with many condemning the police's use of African-American mug shots at a time when racial relations have been strained across the country.

On Friday evening, NMB Police Chief Scott Dennis said that he realized the six images may appear offensive when viewed apart from other targets, such as images of late terrorist Osama Bin Laden.

'For that reason, I immediately suspend the sniper training program,' he said, adding that he was particularly concerned about the use of photos of men who 'would be on the streets' of the city.

Chief Dennis said the force is reviewing the materials its snipers use, ordering commercially produced images  instead of mug shots and launching an investigation, the Miami Herald reported.

But he said no-one in the sniper team - which  includes minorities - will be disciplined for using the black teenagers' mug shots as targets - an action which did not violate any department policies.

Sgt Deant, who plays clarinet with the National Guard’s 13th Army Band, was attending the range after the snipers for annual weapons qualifications training when she discovered the mug shots.

Shocked: After Florida Army National Guard sergeant Valerie Deant (pictured) - who coincidentally happens to be Deant's sister - found the targets discarded in a bin at the range, she posted an image of them online

Speaking to NBC, she said she was shocked to recognize her brother in one of the images, particularly because he was arrested 15 years ago and his photo was littered with bullet holes. 

'I was like 'why is my brother being used for target practice?' she said. 'There were like gunshots there. And I cried a couple of times.'

Following Ms Deant's discovery, she immediately called her brother, who was speechless.

Deant then took to his Facebook page to share the image of the targets - including himself - to his friends, writing: 'ATTENTION!!!!! To all my friends, Facebook friends and family.

'I have fallen victim to criminal profiling by the North Miami Beach Police Dept.

'We are targets!!!!'

He later told the news station: 'The picture actually has like bullet holes. One in my forehead and one in my eye... I was speechless.' He added: 'I’m a father. I’m a husband. I’m a career man.'

In defense of the black mug shots, Major Kathy Katerman said the police force's snipers also shoot at image of white men, saying: 'We have other targets, too. We don’t just shoot at black males.'

She added that the snipers find it useful to use lineups with faces that share similar characteristics - and that the targets should have been properly disposed of before the police left the range.

However, the use of photo lineups for target practice - instead of commercially produced images - does not appear to be a common practice among police departments in the area.

Neither Miami-Dade police, nor four other forces, use such photos to practice their marksmanship.

H.T. Smith, a prominent local attorney and Army veteran, said his unit never considered shooting at images of real people, saying: 'Of course it's offensive. You shouldn't be shooting at faces anyway.'

Retired FBI agent, Alex Vasquez, added: 'The use of those targets doesn’t seem correct. The police have different options for targets. I think they have to be extra careful and sensitive to some issues.'

Killed: In recent months, racial tensions in America have made headlines across the world. There have been violent protests over grand jury decisions following the deaths of Michael Brown (left) and Eric Garner (right)

In recent months, racial tensions in America have made headlines across the world.

In November, a grand jury in Ferguson, Missouri, chose not to indict white police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of unarmed black 18-year-old Michael Brown.

The following month, a separate grand jury decided not to indict white officer Daniel Pantaleo over the 'chokehold' killing of 43-year-old father Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York.

The rulings sparked violent protests in more than 170 US cities.
