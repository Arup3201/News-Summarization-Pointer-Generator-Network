Patrick Mills has become the third Australian to win the NBA title after putting in an astounding performance for the San Antonio Spurs on Monday - but he could just as easily have become an AFL star, his former PE teacher has revealed.

The 25-year-old also became the first ever indigenous player to take home the NBA grand prize, after his impressive appearance alongside Queensland team-mate Aron Baynes at the AT&T Center, San Antonia. 

Spurs scooped a 104-87 win over Miami Heat, helped in huge part by the 17 points Mills scored in his triumphant 18 minutes on the court.

The 6ft player, who was born in Canberra, shot a barrage of three-pointers in a five minute stretch.

And the Australian star blew past NBA American heavyweights on the court such as LeBron James.

For anyone who watched Mills on the court, he might have seemed like a born basketball player.

But his former PE teacher at Marist College in Canberra has told MailOnline the talented sportsman could have just as easily been an AFL star.

Mark Winchester taught Mills in 2002, while he was in Year 8 at the school.

'You could see whatever he did he was brilliant at,' he said.

Mills played rugby until Year 8 and then switched to AFL.

It wasn't until the age of 15, that he started really focusing on basketball full-time when he was selected for the ACT U-18 squad to compete in the Australian National Championships.

A year later, at the end of Year 10, he had to leave Marist College behind to attend the University of Canberra Senior Secondary College Lake Ginninderra, as it was much closer to The Australian Institute of Sport (AIS).

Mills accepted a full-time scholarship with the AIS, which had previously developed Golden State Warriors player Andrew Bogut, when he was 16.

Multi-talented: Mills was a great dancer, athlete, rugby and AFL star when he was a teenager at school in Canberra, his former PE teacher said

'He didn't really want to leave Marist... but he chose basketball, which is just as well for him,' Mr Winchester laughed on Monday.

Personally, he had hoped Mills would carry on with AFL instead: 'I was Aussie rules trained so I was hoping he would continue.'

'There's no doubt he would have got drafted,' Mr Winchester said.

Since leaving Marist College at the end of 2004, Mills has continued to return to his former school over the years - even now he is a world famous sportsman.

Mills entered the NBA Draft in 2009, when he was selected with the Portland Trail Blazers.

On 29 August 2011, during the 2011 NBA lockout, Mills signed with the Melbourne Tigers in Australia for the 2011–12 NBL season. He then moved to China to play with the Xinjiang Flying Tigers.

He eventually returned to the US in March 2012, when he was signed with the San Antonio Spurs - his current team.

'He's always very humble... every time he comes back to Canberra he visits us.

'We've got one of his Australia Basketball singlets in our Hall of Fame,' Mr Winchester said.

Where it all began: Mills excelled at sports while studying at Marist College in Canberra from 2001-2004

'He also used to come back and perform with our traditional dance group... he's a great dancer too,' he added.

Mr Winchester described Mills as 'very friendly, extremely athletic and well motivated'.

Mills' mother Yvonne was part of the Stolen Generation and his father Benny is a Torres Strait Islander.

The 25-year-old is not the first talented sportstar in his family.

His uncle Danny Morseau was the first indigenous basketball player for Australia at the Olympics in 1980.

Morseau was in San Antonio for the NBA final on Monday and watched proudly as Mills became the first ever indigenous player to win the title.
