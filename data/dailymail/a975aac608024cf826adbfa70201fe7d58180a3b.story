Michael Jackson's jailed doctor has finally broken his silence to reveal the King of Pop's final words.

Conrad Murray refused to give evidence at his trial to explain how Jackson died.

But the 58-year-old cardiologist 
talked publicly about the 50-year-old superstar's last moments in a 
paid-for interview for a TV documentary.

'He was pleading and begging to 
please please let him have some milk because that was the only thing 
that would work,' said Murray.

The disgraced doctor was referring to propofol, the powerful hospital anaesthetic Jackson overdosed on the day he died.

On Monday, a jury in Los Angeles convicted Murray of involuntary manslaughter for administering the lethal injection.

In the documentary, to be screened on
Channel Four later this week, Murray said Jackson looked like the 
heavily made-up character he portrayed in his famous 'Thriller' video in
the days before he died.

'He really could not sleep. Have you ever seen the Thriller image when he was made up? He looked that hysterical,' he said.

The physician's two-and-a-half hour 
interview with detectives was the only explanation the jury and 
Jackson's family have had from Murray, who was the only person with the 
star when he died on June 25, 2009.

But after a scene showing him 
praying, Murray reveals for the first time on camera what happened in 
Jackson's bedroom and blames the star's bodyguard for the chaos.

He was lambasted by a string of 
witnesses for delaying more than 20 minutes before calling for help 
after finding the star's lifeless body.

When asked if he wanted to testify, 
he declined fearing his story would be ripped apart by prosecutors. He 
barely said more than a few words in the courtroom

But recounting what happened in the 
TV interview, Murray said: 'I told security to get the kids away from 
there, get the kids away because I did not want them to see their father
getting CPR.

'And he (the security guard) says, 
'Doctor, doctor, what happened?' I need help! I'm doing CPR, Mr 
Jackson's not breathing! Call 911! I need you to call 911!

'They listen to me doing CPR. Chest 
compressions, I'm trying to resuscitate this patient. I'm controlling 
him (the security guard) on the 911 call.

The jury was sensationally shown this image of Jackson's dead body by the prosecution early on in Murray's trial

'How old is this patient? 50!' Shouting, Murray added: 'Get the **** over here. Get here! I need you. Come on! Help me.'

An excerpt from the documentary, 
'Michael Jackson and the Doctor: A Fatal Friendship' was shown on 
breakfast TV in the US yesterday and it will be screened in full on 
Friday night.

Murray describes his close 
relationship with Jackson, saying they both grew up having difficult 
relationships with their fathers.

'He (Jackson) said of all my life I 
have found one friend, which is you, Dr Conrad. I think in many ways 
there are some mirror images of our lives, especially in not having the 
full appreciation from our fathers,' said the doctor.

'He had a dad who never hugged him, 
never hugged his own children. He lived a life greater than 100 years of
pain, only human on Earth.'

He said he helped Jackson get rid of painful calluses on his feet and got him manicures and pedicures.

Murray was also interviewed sitting 
in a car outside the rented mansion where Jackson died. He told how he 
would help sneak his famous patient out by hiding him in the back of his
car.

'He liked those risks,' he added.

Jackson's older sister Rebbe said 
yesterday that children Prince, 14, Paris, 13 and nine-year-old Blanket 
were at school when the guilty verdict was announced on Monday.

'They now 'feel a lot of relief,' she added.

Murray, who will return to court on 
November 29 for sentencing, was said to be on suicide watch in his cell 
where he is being held without bail.

He is being held in solitary 
confinement in the medical wing of Los Angeles County Jail because of 
fears he could be targeted by other inmates.

It emerged yesterday that Murray is likely to walk free in months even if he is sent to jail for the maximum four years.

It is even possible he could be 
allowed to remain at home on house arrest with an electronic tracker 
ankle bracelet, according to law enforcement sources in Los Angeles.

With the city's jail system bursting 
at the seams, judges have little control over the amount of any prison 
term inmates have to complete.

Under new guidelines targeting jail 
overcrowding, non-violent criminals must be sent to local lock-ups 
rather than tough state prisons.

Legal analysts said the three-year 
prison sentence being predicted as the most likely punishment for Murray
might amount to less than six months behind bars.

'He could also serve a sentence on 
house arrest or other possible alternatives to incarceration,' said 
Julia Mezhinsky Jayne, vice chair of the Criminal Law Section of the 
California Bar.

The jury of seven men and five women 
returned their unanimous verdict after almost two days of deliberations 
at the end of the six-week trial.

But Murray's court ordeal isn't over.
He now faces a civil lawsuit filed by Jackson's father, Joe, claiming 
unspecified damages for his negligence in causing the performer's death.
