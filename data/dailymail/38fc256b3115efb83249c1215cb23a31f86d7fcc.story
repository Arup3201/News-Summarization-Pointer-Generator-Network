Victim: Alice Hicks, 27, died from her injuries after her partner Daniel Day crashed her car while 'racing' on a country road

A motorist killed his girlfriend when he crashed her car while driving at 'vastly excessive speeds' on a country road, a court heard.

Daniel Day, 34, was racing a Mini Cooper belonging to his partner Alice Hicks, 27, at up to 80mph when he lost control on a blind bend.

The car swerved and skidded out of control before smashing into a Mazda driving in the opposite direction leaving trainee accountant Alice with fatal injuries.

Day is facing jail after being 
convicted of causing his girlfriend's death by dangerous driving. She 
died a day after the collision.

He
denied the offence but was convicted following a week-long trial at 
Taunton Crown Court, with the jury reaching their guilty verdict in just
40 minutes.

Today Alice's devastated family welcomed the decision but said it would not bring their 'beautiful daughter' back.

Proud mother Yvonne Hicks, 59, a receptionist from Bleadon Hill, Somerset, described her daughter as 'the centre of the family'.

She said: 'I am just pleased with the outcome but nothing will ever bring her back.

'We
all miss her terribly, she was the centre of our lives, she did so much
for us all. We now need to think of all the happy times that we all had
together.'

Taunton Crown 
Court was told how Day 'revved' Alice's blue Mini Cooper as he drove 
down the country road near Rooksbridge on September 24, 2011.

Day
ignored 'ample warning signs', including four which said 'slow' and 
another on a lamppost instructing him to 'reduce speed now' before 
taking a blind bend.

He approached the corner at speeds of up to 80mph according to witnesses, who described seeing him 'whizzing' past.

Moments before the crash, driver Kevin Buck had stopped his Mercedes van around the bend as he waited to turn right into Biddisham, Somerset.

Day, from Lower Weare, Somerset, swerved around the van, as well as a Ford Focus behind it before colliding with a Mazda driving in the opposite direction.

Anguish: Alice's father Raymond Hicks had given his trainee accountant daughter his cap and gown from university to wear at her graduation

The jury was told Alice's convertible Mini was still travelling at speed on impact and had little or no chance of stopping when the driver saw stationary traffic.

They also heard evidence that neither Day or Alice had been wearing their seat belt.

Alice, who was sat in the front passenger seat, died from serious head injuries sustained when she was flung from the from the car. The driver of the Mazda survived.

Witness Lucy Fulford, who was a passenger in a Honda Civic travelling in the opposite direction to the Mini prior to the smash.

She told the jury: 'The speed shocked me. I saw the driver, he looked panicked. His arms were rigid and his eyes were wide.

'I smelt rubber.'

Other witnesses estimated that the car had been travelling at between 70 and 90 mph before it went round the blind bend.

Tests showed Day had not taken drugs or consumed alcohol before the smash and there were no faults with the Mini.

Her brother Andrew Hicks said the jury's verdict proved Alice played no part in the accident.

He added: 'We can never be happy because nothing will change the result. But this verdict shows Alice wasn't to blame. She was the centre of our lives.'

Her father Raymond, 79, added that Alice was months away from graduating from an accountancy course at Weston College in Weston-super-Mare.

The retired BT national sales training manager added: 'She died in the September but was due to graduate the following June.

'I had saved my cap and gown for her and she was going to wear it to the ceremony. It is still laid out on her bed.'

Day - who remained emotionless as the verdict was read - will be sentenced at Taunton Crown Court on a date to be fixed.
