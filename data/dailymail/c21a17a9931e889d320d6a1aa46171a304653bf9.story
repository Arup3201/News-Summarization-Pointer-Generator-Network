Rare shots of hyenas hunting buffalos, bathing hippos and a solitary giraffe on the plains of the Serengeti have been captured using a homemade helicopter drone.

British wildlife photographer Will Burrard-Lucas designed the BeetleCopter so he could get up close and personal with the animals without scaring them off, or endangering his life.

He previously designed the Beetlecam, a hidden camera that can be driven across the region, but created the drone to take unique aerial shots.

The remote-controlled BeetleCopter, pictured, is powered by six mini-rotors. It is capable of flying for up to 15 minutes at a time and the Serengeti footage was taken on a GoPro camera. Burrard-Lucas, pictured in the background, was able to control the copter from up to a kilometre away via a live video feed

The remote-controlled BeetleCopter is powered by six mini-rotors and is capable of flying for about 15 minutes at a time.

A variety of cameras can be used and are fitted to the stabilised gimbal - a support that pivots on a single axis - suspended under the body of copter.

Burrard-Lucas was able to control the 
copter from up to a kilometre away using a live video feed and remote 
screen.

He also used virtual-reality goggles ‘like a computer game’ to 
immerse himself in the shoot.

It took five months from August 2013.

Burrard-Lucas is originally from Sevenoaks in Kent but currently lives in Tanzania.

His remote-controlled device is powered by six mini-rotors and capable of flying for about 15 minutes at a time.

The camera is attached to a stabilised gimbal - a support that pivots on a single axis - suspended under the body of copter.

The 30-year-old spent five months from August 2013 building and learning to fly the BeetleCopter before taking it out from a spin in the Serengeti in Tanzania.

His footage was recorded over a two-week period and was shot on a GoPro Hero 3+.

‘These devices have incredible potential in wildlife filmmaking and photography,’ explained Burrard-Lucas.

‘They are much smaller and quieter than a full-blown helicopter so you can get really close to the wildlife without spooking them.'

During his filming he captured sweeping images of migrating wildebeest and antelope as well as more intimate shots of giraffes and hippos.

The BeetleCopter was also able to capture this image of a solitary giraffe. Burrard-Lucas said he designed the drone so he could get up close and personal with the animals without 'spooking them'. He added its perfect because its 'quiet and easily manoeuvrable'

'There is quite a lot of excitement about the possibilities,’ he continued. ‘I have really only scratched the surface.’

But development has been far from plain sailing after Burrard-Lucas 'wrote-off' his BeetleCopter by ploughing it into a tree during testing.

He said: ‘It took a while to get a hang of them. You need have a fair bit of practice before you can start filming, especially when dealing with longer ranges when you can't really see the copter because it is so far away.

'The animals also react differently to
 it. Larger animals don't really see things in the air as a threat 
because their predators are land-based. The hyena in the video was 
really relaxed and only leaned in to sniff it briefly.

‘But I think something like a meerkat would be very spooked by it.’

Other shots captured by the BeetleCopter include this aerial view of a herd of elephants. The photographer claimed larger animals weren't fazed by the drone because they don't see objects in the air as a threat. This is because their predators are usually land-based

By using a GoPro camera, Burrard-Lucas's shots had a spherical appearance, such as this sweeping image of antelopes. The camera was also lightweight enough to make the drone capable of flying for longer distances and using less battery power. There are 91 species of antelope, most of which are native to Africa

Burrard-Lucas, who studied physics at university, made his name with the BeetleCam, a remote-control land-based camera.

He now owns a fleet of eight BeetleCopters, capable of carrying a everything from a GoPro to a full-sized DSLR camera, and is building further models for fellow wildlife photographers and videographers.

He hopes to use his fleet of BeetleCopters to capture more amazing pictures and video across Africa.

He added: ‘It is such a different perspective and people have been amazed by the results. My focus now is to further minimise the sound so that I can get closer to animals without disturbing them.’

The name of the Serengeti, pictured, comes from the Masai language of Maa. The term Serengit' means 'endless plains'. It is one of seven Natural Wonders of Africa and is home to around 70 mammals and 500 bird species
