The Colorado Supreme Court starts hearing arguments Tuesday in a case that may determine how employers handle hiring and firing of marijuana users.

In spite of pot being legal in Colorado, employers can still fire employees for their toking habits, as being a pot smoker is not yet a protected class.

The case was brought to the court by Brendan Coats, 35, a quadriplegic who was fired by Dish Network in 2010 after marijuana was found in his system.

Fired: Brendan Coats, 35, was let go from Dish Network after failing a random drug test in 2010, in spite of medical marijuana being legal

Coats began using medical marijuana at a doctor's urging to calm violent muscle spasms that interfered with his ability to work.

The spasms were due to Coats's being paralyzed in a car crash as a teenager.

The firing came after a random drug test was administered to Coats after he had been employed with Dish Network for three years.

Coats apparently informed his supervisors ahead of time he would fail the test, since THC, the active ingredient in pot, stays in the system for weeks after it enters the body.

The Associated Press reports that Coats's lawyers are challenging his firing using a rule meant to ensure cigarette smokers cannot be targeted for smoking off the job.

;Attitudes are changing toward marijuana. Laws are going to have to change, too,' said Coats, who has not been able to find an employer who would hire him after Dish Network. 

'I'd like for this to enable people like me to find employment without being looked down upon.'

Dish Network has argued in complaints that companies like it in Colorado would have to keep employees with 'marijuana-induced performance problems,' and could lose federal contracts if Coats wins.

Currently, Dish Network is using federal employment law, which bans marijuana use, to argue that their firing was legal.

Colorado has led the fight for legalizing marijuana, with voters approving an initiative allowing medical marijuana use in 2000, followed by the approval of recreational marijuana in 2013.
