Steven Gerrard is refusing to get carried away when it comes to the importance of England's World Cup clash with Uruguay, but the Three Lions skipper insists Roy Hodgson's squad believe they will beat Luis Suarez and Co in Sao Paulo on Thursday.

England are in desperate need of a win after falling to defeat Italy in their opening game and Gerrard is confident that his team-mates will come away from their second game with a positive result to show for their efforts.

Speaking after training at the Arena Corinthians, Gerrard said: 'It’s not a final. I know Uruguay have said they’ll treat it like a World Cup final. We’ll treat it with importance but it’s not a cup final.

'For me the key is who defends the best. We’re two very good attacking teams. We’re very confident we can get the right result.

'The
 mood is very positive. We were disappointed with the result (against 
Italy) but took positives. We need to forget the Italy result. We can’t 
control that now.

'I think you will see another good attacking performance. That’s why I think the defending will be the key.'

This will almost certainly be Gerrard's last World Cup and the thought of going home prematurely is something which does not sit well with Hodgson's captain.

He added: 'I’ve spoken to the group in the week to reiterate the message about the pain of going out at the World Cup. It’s something we don’t want. We want to be here for as long as possible. We’ve all aware how difficult it will be if we don’t perform tomorrow.'

A defeat to Uruguay, coupled with a draw between Italy and Costa Rica on Friday, would mean an early exit for Gerrard and Co, but the Liverpool midfielder is focused and full of belief heading into Thursday's crucial clash with Oscar Tabarez's side.

'It’s very difficult to forget about the game. It’s a big game. I’ll be on my iPad studying on the opposition. I’m not feeling the game. I’m in confident mood. I’ve got faith in my team-mates,' said Gerrard.

One player Gerrard is backing to continue his rapid rise is Raheem Sterling. The 19-year-old was England's standout player against the Azzurri and he looks set to start again in Sao Paulo.

On his Reds team-mate, Gerrard said: 'At the risk of putting more pressure on a young player, everyone can see his potential. He’s had a fantastic season for Liverpool. He was consistent.

'I’m sure he’s going to be around at this level for a very long time. He’s got great pace. My prediction is that he’ll get many, many caps and be a big player for England.'

The England captain will of course be facing his Liverpool teammate Luis Suarez who he rates as the best player he has ever played with. However, despite his close relationship with the Uruguay striker, Gerrard insists he will not contact him on game day.

'I’m not going to speak to him before the
game. That would be disrespectful to my team-mates. We’ve had conversations in
the build-up to this game but there will be no conversation tomorrow,' said Gerrard.

Suarez is set to return after missing the opening game against Costa Rica while he recovered from knee surgery but, while Gerrard respects his Anfield colleague's talent, he insists the Premier League's leading scorer shouldn't be treated any differently.

'Luis Suarez is a genius, I’ve said it many times. It
will be a boost for Uruguay and their supporters to have him back but they’re more
than one player. They’re a good team. We treat Suarez like any other Uruguay player. We
have a game-plan to try and win this match.'
