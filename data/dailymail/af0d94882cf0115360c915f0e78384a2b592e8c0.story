A 22-year-old man has been charged with the rape and murder of a five-year-old girl whose burned body was found in an abandoned house.

Darnell Cheatham had been dating Mariha Smith's aunt around the time he is accused of brutally attacking her in July 2011.

The Detroit, Michigan man had been a suspect from the moment Mariha's body was found, with her skull crushed, but police didn't have enough evidence to convict him until Monday.

Charged: Darnell Cheatham, pictured at a 2011 hearing, has been charged with murder, arson, torture and child abuse over the death of five-year-old Mariha Smith

Snatched: Mariha was taken from her Burlingame home in the early hours of July 24, 2011, then assaulted and killed

Cheatham is accused of snatching Mariha 
from the house she shared with her mother, Konesha, and aunt, Quanita, 
who he was in a relationship with.

He has been charged with first-degree premediated murder, felony murder, arson, torture, child abuse, and dismemberment and mutilation of a body, the Huffington Post reported.

Police believe he took the little girl at about 3.30am to an abandoned house a mile from her Burlingame home. He then allegedly raped and killed her, before setting fire to the mattress her body was left on.

One of Mariha's brothers allegedly told police he saw Cheatham abduct his sister from the front room where they were sleeping.

She was reported missing by her mother a few hours later and Mariha's body was found at 8am on July 24, 2011, after Detroit Fire Department was called to an abandoned house.

Miss Smith said at the time she couldn't remember anything about the disappearance because she was passed out on a sofa.

While the search for her daughter was still continuing, the then 24-year-old told CBS Detroit that she had last seen Mariha when the little girl and her three siblings settled down in the living room for the night.

She has not yet commented on the charges made against Cheatham, but Mariha's grandmother said she was glad the child's killer had finally been caught.

Horrific: The burned body of Mariha was discovered in this abandoned Detroit house near to her home

Footage: Security cameras caught a man believed to be Cheatham buying a can of gas on the morning Mariha died

Frantic: Just a few hours after Mariha's mother, Konesha Smith, reported her missing the little girl's burned body was found

'I am so glad that they caught him and my grand baby can rest in peace,' Diane Henry told Fox 2. 'He may be locked up but he's still breathing. See, that's the problem - he's still breathing. He should suffer just like my granddaughter suffered.'

When Mariha's body was found, her skull had been crushed and her body badly burned. The cause of death was asphyxiation.

Assistant prosecutor Mark Hindelang asked that no bond be set for Cheatham because of the seriousness of the charges against him.

'This very difficult case was solved due to the diligence and tenacity of Wayne County prosecutors and Wayne County Prosecutor's Office investigators,' prosecutor Kym Worthy said.

'Much of the work was done on their own time to finally bring justice to little Mariha,' she added.

When police started their investigation Cheatham was reportedly identified in CCTV footage that showed a man purchasing 41 cents of gasoline at 7.44am on the day Mariha was found.

He was taken into custody, along with the child's aunt, Quanita, but although the couple both failed their polygraph tests, there was not enough evidence to hold them.

Suspect: It took two years for police to collect enough evidence to convict 22-year-old Cheatham

Murder: Cheatham is accused of abusing and killing Mariha in an abandoned house near to her home

Connection: Mariha's aunt, Quanita, was in a relationship with Cheatham at the time of the five-year-old's abduction

It may have taken two years to press charges in the case, but residents in the neighborhood where little Mariha was killed has not forgotten the little girl who loved to sing.

Outside the charred, abandoned house where her tiny body was found, piles of rain-soaked cuddly toys, left by well-wishers, fill the steps and path.

Damara Hawkins, who lives just a couple of doors away from where Mariha was murdered, told the Detroit Free Press she thinks about the little girl every day.

'The whole situation is kind of a replay in my head because I canâ€™t forget that day. It was very sad how everything happened,' the 18-year-old said.

First-degree murder under Michigan law carries a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, according to the Charlotte Observer.

A preliminary hearing for Cheatham is due to take place on November 1.
