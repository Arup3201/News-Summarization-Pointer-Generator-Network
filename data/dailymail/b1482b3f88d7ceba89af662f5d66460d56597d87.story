An ‘extremely rare’ board game piece from the seventh century has been unearthed that casts raucous Anglo Saxon feasts in a new light.

The draughts piece was discovered in the foundations of a royal great hall in Lyminge, Kent, and archaeologists believe it shows a more cerebral side to Anglo Saxon festivities, which are thought to have involved a great deal of mead drinking.

It is made from a hollow cylinder of bone that has been smoothed with lathe-turned end caps and secured with a small bronze rivet in the centre.

The games piece is the first to be found away from a burial site and the first of its kind to be discovered for 130 years.

Experts from the University of Reading believe it would have been used for a game similar to that of backgammon or draughts.

The Anglo Saxons had a strong tradition of playing board games and individual gaming pieces - and sometimes complete sets - have been discovered in burials of the period.

However the fact the piece was discovered in a ‘gaming setting', an Anglo Saxon royal hall, suggests the people at the time played board games while enjoying the kind of lively feasts described in Beowulf.

It is difficult to establish the precise nature of the games played, but archaeological evidence from the Germanic continent, the cultural home of the Anglo Saxons, provides clues, according to the archaeologists.

Both 'tabula', a form of backgammon, and 'latrunculi', a board game similar to checkers, can be traced to these regions and were likely transported to England during the fifth century as a consequence of Anglo Saxon migrations.

Dr Gabor Thomas and his team at the university also uncovered items of jewellery, numerous fragments of luxury vessel glass and pits with animal bones, confirming that feasting and social display were integral to Lyminge's role as a place of royal ceremonial events and gatherings during the late 6th and 7th centuries.

Dr Thomas said: ‘Our excavation is providing an unprecedented picture of life in an Anglo Saxon royal complex.

Fragments of precious glass vessels are pictured. The glasses were not designed to be stood up like at dinner parties today, but would have been continually passed around and topped up by servants, Dr Thomas said

‘Gaming, along with feasting, drinking, and music, formed one of the key entertainments of the Anglo Saxon mead-hall as evoked in the poem Beowulf.

‘The discovery of Anglo Saxon gaming pieces and gaming boards has previously been restricted to male burials, particularly those of the Anglo Saxon elite.

‘To find such a well preserved example in the hall, where such board games were actually played, is a wonderfully evocative discovery.’

Much of our understanding of Anglo Saxon socialising comes from the epic poem Beowulf, where feasts are described as being mead drinking marathons, where drinks were spilled as glass cups had round bottoms and drinking games were played while music was played.

Dr Thomas and his team at the university, also uncovered items of jewellery. Archaeologists have described the find, pictured, as a miniature radiate headed brooch

Dr Thomas told MailOnline that precious glass vessels were not designed to be stood up like at dinner parties today, but would have been continually passed around and topped up by servants.

'They drank to get inebriated but it was a sociable activity... and there was little requirement to put the glasses down.'

He said a royal feat would have included plenty of mead and possibly wine and archaeological remains show that lots of meat - particularly suckling pig - would have been on the menu.

'Imagine rich food along with drink and music and heroic poetry being recited - there was a lot going on,' he said.

Dr Thomas believes gaming was an important part of the feasts and the king might have played other members of the court and it would have been a competitive activity.

'It was lively and not too different from Christmas parties these days,' he added.

Lyminge's royal complex was first discovered in 2012 when an Anglo Saxon feasting hall was unearthed - the first such building to be excavated in its entirely in over a generation.

The researchers discovered a sequence of three timber halls, bearing unusual and highly elaborate architectural features. This included mortar and crushed tile floors previously only seen in the earliest generation of Anglo Saxon churches and massive entrance portals on a scale previously unparalleled in Anglo Saxon England.

‘By combining these fascinating structural remains with a stunning array of artefacts, our excavations are providing new insights into the role played by Anglo Saxon royal complexes in forging kingdoms and royal dynasties during this key period in English history,’ Dr Thomas added.
