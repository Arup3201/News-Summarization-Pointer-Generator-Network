Well-off customers with Orange or T-Mobile who phone its helpline can pay extra to have their complaint heard first.

Parent company EE has launched what it calls a ‘priority answer service’ which allows customers with a query to pay 50p to jump to the front of the queue.

Callers to its helpline will hear a recorded message asking if they want to pay the fee to be fast-tracked.

Stress-free fee? EE is letting its customers skip lengthy phone call queues - for the cost of 50p

Accept and you’ll be put straight through to customer service - the charge will appear on your next bill.

The service is on offer to all 26 million customers with EE - parent company to Orange and T-Mobile - regardless of whether they are on a monthly contract, pay-as-you go or SIM only deal.

EE said it had introduced the charge to help pay for investment in its stores and call centres.

But experts warned it would create customer service which discriminated against the less well-off.

Rob Kerr, mobiles expert at telecoms price comparison website uSwitch.com, said:

‘Priority queuing will create a two-tier system.

‘It’s all very well slashing waiting times for those who pay the 50p premium - but EE’s not made it clear if that means non-priority queuers will be left hanging on for longer than usual as a consequence.

Investment: Bosses at the mobile phone company admitted the charge would go towards its many stores

‘Paying extra to get bumped up the queue for customer support is slightly adding insult to injury, as most people are calling when they need help the most.’

An EE spokesman said: ‘We’re investing significantly in our retail stores, contact centres and account management websites.

‘To contribute to this and other investments in service, we have introduced some small charges for certain customer services.’
