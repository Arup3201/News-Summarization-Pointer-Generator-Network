Abandoned: Baby Mia Graci Thompson, pictured, was left on the side of a rural road by her mother yesterday morning

A 19-year-old mother has confessed to dumping her three-week-old daughter on the side of a gravel road after telling police the infant had been abducted from the back of her car while she was at the Post Office.

Kendra Meaker admitted to police that she placed Baby Mia Graci Thompson on the side of a rural road near a creek outside Toulon, Illinois, and drove off, Stark County Sheriff Jimmie Dison said today.

But he said the young mother hadn't offered any reason for why she left her baby in the ditch on the desolate road.

Dison added that there was no indication so far that the babyâ€™s father, Tim Thompson, had anything to do with the incident.

Baby Mia was found alive just before 
8pm yesterday, nearly
12 hours after she was reportedly abducted while her mother, Kendra 
Meaker, 19, was running an errand at the Toulon Post Office.

The Stark County Sheriff arrested Meaker in connection with the child's reported disappearance soon after the child was found.

According to WQAD, Meaker will make a first appearance today in Stark County Circuit Court
today, where a judge will determine what charges she faces.

She was 
being held on Thursday night without bond in the Stark County Jail.
