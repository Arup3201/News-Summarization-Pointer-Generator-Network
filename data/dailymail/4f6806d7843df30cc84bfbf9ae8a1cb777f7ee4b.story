A two-year-old boy who was found in a hot car last week has died in hospital two days after his father was arrested .

Jordan Cartee was found last Thursday afternoon outside of his family's home in Anna, Texas, after his father left him in the vehicle.

The child was found alive, but unresponsive, and was taken to Children's Medical Center in Dallas by air ambulance. On Sunday, the boy's condition worsened and he died on Monday night, according to NBC 5.

Suspect: Joshua Cartree, Jordan's father, was arrested on Friday and has been held in custody

The boy's father, Joshua Cartree, 32, was arrested in the hospital last week and charged with injury to a child.

He has since been held in the Collin County jail but police have not indicated whether he will receive more serious charges as a result.

Since Jordan was found, it revealed that the
family was recently the subject of an investigation by Child Protective 
Services, after Jordan was spotted walking alone by his neighbour.

However the investigation is said to have ended 
last week after the family installed new locks at their home so 
their child would be more secure.

It is rumoured the inside of the car was 108 degrees when Jordan was found on Thursday but the Dallas County Medical Examinerâ€™s Officers has not yet released the two-year-old's cause of death.

On Friday, the family said the boy had been put into a medically-induced coma to try and reduce swelling in his brain.
