A transatlantic banking watchdog would protect American and British taxpayers from bailing out banks which are too big to fail, under plans set out today.

Instead shareholders and creditors on both sides of the Atlantic would be forced to take the losses in the event of another banking crash.

It marks a significant shift from the situation in which UK taxpayers stumped up billions to rescue stricken lenders such as Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group.

'Shortcomings': Taxpayers stumped up billions to rescue stricken lenders including RBS in the wake of the financial crisis

The British government pumped an eye-watering £66billion into RBS and Lloyds at the height of the crisis and is years away from getting its money back.

It was also forced to bail out basket case lenders Northern Rock, Bradford & Bingley and Alliance & Leicester.

'The too big to fail problem simply must be cured'

Paul Tucker, Bank of England deputy governor for financial stability

Officials in the United Kingdom and United States have now drawn up plans to ensure that failed banks can be dealt with in future without taxpayer funds.

A single entity would exist in place of national bodies dealing with the subsidiaries of the financial firm in trouble in each separate country.

Paul Tucker, deputy governor for financial stability at the Bank of England, said: 'The "too big to fail" problem simply must be cured. We believe it can be and that this joint paper provides evidence of the serious progress that is being made.'

The report by the Bank of England in the UK and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the US says: ‘The financial crisis that began in late 2007 highlighted the shortcomings of the arrangements for handling the failure of large financial institutions that were in place on either side of the Atlantic.

‘Strategies have been designed to enable large and complex cross-border firms to be resolved without threatening financial stability and without putting public funds at risk.’

It will involve shareholders and creditors taking losses instead of taxpayers.

Regulators: The Bank of England has said the joint paper is evidence of the work underway to solve the problem of banks being 'too big to fail'

Major banks are deemed ‘too big to fail’ because allowing them to collapse would have a devastating impact on borrowers, savers and the wider economy.

Today’s report suggests that banks causing distress would be restructured, shrunk, broken up or closed down.

It also warns that ‘culpable senior management’ would be replaced and held ‘accountable for their actions’.

And it is likely that shareholders would lose all value.

‘The goal is to produce resolution strategies that could be implemented for the failure of one or more of the largest financial institutions with extensive activities in our respective jurisdictions,’ the report says.

‘These resolution strategies should maintain systemically important operations and contain threats to financial stability.

‘They should also assign losses to shareholders and unsecured creditors in the group, thereby avoiding the need for a bailout by taxpayers.’

The report argues that an overhaul is needed because letting banks go bust ‘can create significant and systemic risk for the real economy’ including disruption to critical services and the freezing of financial markets.

It says that the fear of such a devastating hit to the economy meant that the UK and US governments ‘resorted to providing large scale public support to failing financial companies during the 2007-09 crisis’.

It adds: ‘This public support has exposed taxpayers to loss and resulted in the bailout of multiple financial institutions and their creditors.’
