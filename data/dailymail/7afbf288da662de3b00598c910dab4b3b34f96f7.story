Scientists have found a way to predict whether convicted criminals are likely to re-offend by looking at their brain

Neuroscientists claim to have found a way to predict whether convicted criminals are likely to re-offend by looking at their brain scans

According to American imaging experts, convicts showing low activity in an area of the brain associated with decision-making and action are more likely to be arrested again.

A team led by Kent Kiehl, a neuroscientist at the Mind Research Network in Albuquerque, studied a group of 96 male prisoners shortly before they were due to be released.  

They scanned prisoners brains while they were carrying out computer tasks in which subjects had to make quick decisions and inhibit impulsive reactions.

The researchers used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to focus on activity in a section of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) -  a small region in the front of the brain involved in motor control and executive functioning.

They then followed the subjects for four years. 

Among the ex-criminals studied, those who had lower ACC activity during the quick-decision tasks were more likely to be arrested again after getting out of prison.

This was even after the researchers accounted for other risk factors such as age, drug and alcohol abuse and psychopathic traits, Nature.com reports.

According to American brain imaging experts, convicts showing low activity in an area of the brain associated with decision-making and action are more likely to be arrested again

Men who were in the lower half of the ACC activity ranking had a 2.6-fold higher rate of rearrest for all crimes and a 4.3-fold higher rate for nonviolent crimes.

The results are published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences1.

Kiehl admits that more work is needed to prove the technique and added  that low ACC activity could have a variety of causes — impulsivity, caffeine use, vascular health, low motivation or better neural efficiency — and not all of these are related to criminal behaviour.
