Asda has taken thousands of bottles of Prosecco off their shelves  - amid fears they could explode. 

The supermarket giant issued an urgent product recall and asked customers to bring the Italian sparkling wine back to their local stores.

The chain warned customers the bottles could be dangerous and issued the alert after it was found that some bottles of Prosecco Spumante Extra Dry - which sells for £5.48 - could shatter.

A spokesman for Asda said: 'If you have purchased this product please take it back to your local Asda for a full refund.

'No receipt is necessary and if you know someone else who has one please ask them to return it to us.'

Bottles which pose a risk can be identified by a Lot Code on the back label, which include one of the codes: L1402606, L1403271, L1403503, L1403655, L1404044.

A spokesman said: 'We have had a handful of complaints about our Prosecco Spumante Extra Dry bottles shattering.

'We take this incredibly seriously as our customer and colleague’s safety is paramount to us, which is why we’ve recalled certain LOT numbers of this product as a precaution.'

Prosecco has seen a surge in popularity in recent years with sales of the sparkling wine overtaking champagne. 

Recent sales figures from Waitrose and Sainsbury’s show they’ve sold almost 70 per cent more prosecco than this time last year. 

Last Christmas, the Co-op already shifted more  prosecco than milk during the festive period.  

In its native Italy, prosecco is known as a springtime drink and it is meant to be drunk young, rather than left to age. Last year, 307 million bottles were sold globally, while champagne sales lagged behind at 304 million.

In Britain, 38 million bottles of prosecco flew off the shelves, and sales are set to be higher this year.
