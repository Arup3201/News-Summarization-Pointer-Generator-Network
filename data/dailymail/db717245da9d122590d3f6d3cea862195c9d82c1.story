Gus Poyet believes it is a ‘disgrace’ that Premier League teams play twice in 48 hours between Christmas and New Year.

Sunderland were beaten 3-1 by Hull on Boxing Day and travel to Aston Villa on Sunday afternoon.

Poyet, though, has hit out at the festive fixture schedule.

Sunderland manager Gus Poyet is annoyed his side must play twice within the space of 48 hours

‘We shouldn't be playing (on Sunday),’ said the Uruguayan.

‘I've been in England for a long time and I know that Boxing Day games are a tradition and I accept that and think we should maintain it.

‘But I think that then playing on the 28th is a disgrace. We shouldn't be playing then, we shouldn't.

‘If you want to see the best players performing well, you need to make sure you are not playing every two days.

‘It is not needed. That is not tradition and anyone who says it is, is not telling the truth.’

The defeat came in stark contrast to last weekend's euphoric late win in the Tyne-Wear derby

Connor Wickham returns from suspension while Emanuele Giaccherini could make his first start since September. 

Patrick van Aanholt (shoulder) and Anthony Reveillere (calf) remain sidelined. 

The Black Cats failed to build on the euphoria of their Tyne-Wear derby win against Hull and their second-half performance was among their worst of the season.

And Poyet says the only consolation of the 48-hour turnaround is the chance to make amends for that poor showing.

‘One of the good things is that we play again in two days - that's the only good thing about it,’ he added.

‘We need to perform better. Better decisions on the ball, not hurry and get carried away with the noise and the fans pushing us forward.

‘We have some qualities and we need to respect those qualities. For us, it is important to believe in what we do and not what people think we should be doing.’
