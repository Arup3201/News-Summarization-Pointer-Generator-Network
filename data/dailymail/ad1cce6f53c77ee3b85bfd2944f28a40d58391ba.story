Gamblers at SkyCity Casino on Saturday night knew they were rolling the dice, but they probably didn't know they were playing Russian roulette with a lethal sea snake.

Just after midnight, security at the Arafura seaside  casino called a local snake catcher to say they had found a 1.3 metre long yellow-lipped sea krait.

The snake had already been partially stuffed in a lunch bag by security, meaning Phil Mangion had an easy job passing her onto Environmental scientist Mick Guinea, who completed his masters on sea kraits.

‘It was thrilling. It’s always exciting when animals cross into uncharted territories. There is no breeding population for these snakes in Australia,’ Dr Guinea said.

The serpent is native to Samoa, South India, Japan and Papua New Guinea. But Dr Guinea believes they could also be looking down under for new stomping grounds.

‘It’s very likely they could be naturally migrating. They have a very high range of habitats, and it could be that they are expanding this range.' 

‘She probably arrived of her own stream, perhaps from some northern Indonesian islands like Aru, as the current sweeps from these areas up the northern coastline of Australia.'

‘Otherwise it’s possible, she could be a stowaway.’

They are the only sea snake to hatch their eggs on land, and Guinea says she was highly fertile when he found her.'

The serpent posed a threat to casino goers in SkyCity casino, having fangs as large as a death adder and 12 times the venom needed to kill a human

Snake specialist Mick Guinea says the sea krait could be naturally migrating to Australia

'She had the potential to breed a colony. It's almost breeding season, and she was in great shape with a layer of fat and all of the conditions to have been carrying fertilised eggs.'

Guinea says that since they breed almost exclusively on eels, they would not impede on the feeding of native Australian sea snakes.

The serpent did however pose a threat to casino-goers, having 12 times the venom needed to kill a human, and fangs as large as a death adder.

‘They are a highly venomous snake. They are far more toxic than a taipan snake. The difference with many Australian snakes is that sea krait is very inoffensive. They have a placid personality and loathe to bite.’

Dr Guinea said he was excited to see whether there could be more sea kraits appearing in the future.
