Research: A study by researchers at Fera and the University of Durham suggests a link between the increase in the number of roe deer in the UK and a change in woodland foliage and bird populations

The thriving population of UK roe deer could be damaging the landscape of British woodland, according to a unique new study.

Researchers discovered that areas with the most roe deer had the least shrub layer vegetation cover and fewer birds.

The study results add fuel to the argument that more wild deer need to be culled to protect the environment.

A team from the Food and Environment Research Agency (Fera) and Durham University found that an increase in the population of roe deer is possibly related to a decline in the diversity and cover of shrubs below the main canopy in forest areas.

It is the first UK-based study of its kind on a single species of deer.

Ecologists have long warned that the continued growth in numbers of wild deer could pose a long term threat to woodland.

When presenting their findings at a recent British Ecological Society meeting in Birmingham, researchers said that they feared that if the population continues to grow it could lead to fewer nesting sites for a variety of species of birds and less food sources for other animals.

The study was based on 35 woodland field sites from across England in May and June in 2011 and 2012.

Georgina Palmer, co-author of the study, told the BBC: 'Much of the recent literature on impacts of deer on their environment has focused on multi-species systems and, there, authors cannot attribute impacts they find on vegetation to one particular species.'

'My study is the first in Britain which both looks solely at the roe deer, and within natural environments, ie without the use of deer enclosures where deer densities are artificially managed.'

Not only is the burgeoning population of wild deer a threat to UK woodland. The surge in the number of deer is also a hazard for drivers on our roads:

The roe deer, otherwise known as Capreolus capreolus, is a relatively small reddish and grey-brown deer. It is widespread across western Europe.

The species has seen a huge increase in numbers throughout the 20th and into the 21st century.

The animal was extinct in much of southern England at the start of the 20th century, but numbers have since repopulated.

Roe are mainly woodland deer, but in recent years the rise in numbers has led them to colonising more open areas such as rank heather, scrub and agricultural ground.

They are herbivores and graze all types of ground vegetation.

They also browse shrub layers in a wood, and the growing shoots and leaves of holly and beech trees.

Forestry Commission rangers currently humanely manage roe populations.

The latest study follows research from September which revealed that woodland without effective management systems aimed at controlling deer are more likely to be damaged by the animal.

Wild deer have been roaming Britain for around 6,000 years and it is estimated that there are currently around two million of them.

There are six species present in the UK - roe, red, fallow, muntjac, sika and Chinese water deer - with the roe and red native to the UK, the fallow present in Britain's woodlands since around the 11th century and the Muntjac, Sika and Chinese water deer all introduced in recent centuries.

Overrun: The study results will add fuel to the argument that more wild deer need to be culled each year in order to protect other wildlife

The muntjac deer for example was introduced to Woburn Safari Park but escaped in 1925 leading to the deer's presence in the wild.

Experts from the Deer Initiative, an organisation which has been looking at sustainable management of deer since 1995, recommend that around 20 per cent of the wild deer population in the UK should be culled - that's around 400,000 animals.

The British Trust for Ornithology warned in 2011 that bird species such as the nightingale and willow tit were in danger of dying out because of the increasing number of wild deer.
