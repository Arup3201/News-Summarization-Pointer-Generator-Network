It was from Gleneagles four years ago that Justin Rose received the most disappointing phone call of his professional career.

A recent two-time winner on the PGA Tour, he received the depressing news that he had been overlooked for a wildcard for the Ryder Cup at Celtic Manor.

There’s something poetic, then, about the fact his first home Ryder Cup should be taking place here, of all places.

‘Funny how things turn out,’ he said, smiling. ‘Given the weather at Celtic Manor and the fact it didn’t finish until Monday, I’d imagine it would have been somewhat disappointing for a debut. But you can’t ask for anything better than this for your first one, and in front of a Scottish crowd.’

Rose underlined his affinity with these parts with a links masterclass at Royal Aberdeen in July to walk away with the Scottish Open.

It will earn him some extra kudos from the locals and he’s certainly looking forward to that after what happened at Medinah.

The Englishman’s stirring victory over Phil Mickelson in the singles and the three clutch putts he holed on the final three holes to snatch a win on the 18th were an essential part in the making of the miracle.

But it was what happened outside the ropes that has left him looking forward to playing in front of a home audience for a change.

‘Chicago is a rough, tough sports crowd, that’s for sure,’ he said. ‘There were definitely some occasions on that final day where you were thinking to yourself, “Woah, too far”. But it made it all the more enjoyable the way it turned out.

‘The crowd can definitely have a big impact on the outcome. When the place went silent it really was a case of it being deafening for the Americans. Hopefully, we can avoid that.’

The belief that coursed through Rose following that win over Mickelson has been evident in his wonderfully consistent form since, plus that breakthrough major victory at the US Open last year.

‘It’s fair to say it was the making of me in a way,’ he said. ‘It’s definitely one of those things you draw upon in the pressure moments.

‘Straight after Medinah I won a matchplay tournament in Turkey against players like Tiger and Rory and it has just gone on from there.’

He has been watching highlights of Medinah in recent weeks. ‘I always know when it’s been on at home because I get about 50 tweets from people saying how much they love watching it over and over,’ he said.

‘If someone had said to me growing up that I’d be part of perhaps the greatest Ryder Cup of all time, I’d have gone, “Wow, that’s amazing”.’

Justin Rose practised with Ian Poulter, who he is likely to partner in foursomes

Rose practised on Wednesday with the two players who will almost certainly be his partners over the weekend — Henrik Stenson in fourballs and old mate Ian Poulter in foursomes.

It’s a lovely story how these two have gone from sharing rooms on the Challenge Tour in their formative days to sharing the biggest stage at the Ryder Cup. Could he have imagined it, back then?

‘I’m sure Poults would have had no trouble imagining it,’ he said, laughing. ‘I was just trying to hit the next fairway. No, it’s great for us obviously to see how far we’ve come.’

Anything different he notices about Poulter at the Ryder Cup?

‘In a regular event he gets in and does his business and leaves but at the Ryder Cup he’s a lot more vocal,’ said Rose. ‘He’s not scared of being the leader in that environment and speaking his mind. With his record, he’s now even more confident of saying what he feels and that makes him a great team-room man.

‘A lot of guys might have good things to say but might just hold it back.’

Rose’s two appearances, in 2008 and 2012, have resulted in a fine record from nine matches that has seen him win twice as many games as he has lost, and he’s surely been assigned a key role this time.

Here in Scotland, the Scottish Open champion is ready to feel the love.

The best performance I’ve seen? Twist my arm and I’d settle for Ian Poulter last time over Seve in 1987, Monty in 2002 and Lee Westwood in 2004. 

But one other might top them all when you factor in the emotional context and that was Darren Clarke at the K Club in 2006. 

As he played on following the death of his wife little more than a month earlier, everyone was in bits. 

Big Darren completed three matches against Tiger and the rest and emerged with three victories.

Then he broke down and cried ...and drank a pint of Guinness in about five seconds flat.
