Lindsay Lohan's long journey to rehab took a bizarre twist on Thursday - when the actress changed her mind about checking in to a treatment facility at the last minute.

Lohan was scheduled to enter rehab on Thursday morning to begin her 90 days of court-ordered treatment.

But the troubled starlet is reported to been 'spooked' by the amount of paparazzi waiting outside the Morningside Recovery in Newport Beach, and refused to check into the facility.

Law enforcement sources now tell TMZ 
that prosecutors will seek an arrest warrant for Lindsay Lohan if she's 
not back in rehab by sunrise.

On the run: Lindsay Lohan has failed to enter the rehab facility as ordered by the court and is at risk of being arrested again

Checking in: According to reports Lindsay entered the California centre at 8.45am to start her 90 day stint

Under fire: It has been claimed that Morningside Recovery cannot offer treatment after its licence was revoked

Lindsay's whereabouts are currently unknown.

A source told Radar that Lindsay has apparently been saying for the past six hours that she is 'going to return to the rehab facility but she hasn't yet.'

'She felt Morningside was not suitable for her,' another source told Us Weekly about Lindsay's decision to leave. 'There were too many paparazzi everywhere and she didn't feel safe.

'Nobody close to her is happy about this. They think she's really not being smart.'

Lindsay's decision to leave rehab came while her lawyer Mark Heller was in court telling a judge that she had entered the facility at 8.45am.

Mixing things up: Lindsay is reportedly unhappy with her lawyer Mark Heller's progress with the case, and has hired back her former lawyer Shawn Holley

Could face arrest: Lindsay’s failure to check in to the facility is likely a violation of her recent plea deal

Lindsay's
SUV arrived at the California facility but the vehicle left with Lindsay still inside, according to TMZ.

RadarOnline, however, reports that Lindsay did in fact walk through the doors of the facility, but left just a few minutes later.

'She told people there that she didn't need rehab,' a source told Radar. 'And then she left. Everyone was stunned.'

Lindsay's father Michael also confirmed to Radar that his daughter never checked in.

'I have no other choice than to get this out there to help Lindsay,' he said.

Backing out: An image has been released which appears to show Lindsay and her luggage arriving at the facility

Retail therapy: At 8.45am, 15 minutes after she was due to check into her rehab facility, Lindsay was seen shopping at Fry's electronics store

Lindsay was spotted at a Fry's Electronics store 
in Fountain Valley at 8.45am, while at the same time her lawyer
Mark Heller was in court asserting she had already checked into rehab.

After refusing to check into 
Morningside, Lindsay allegedly insisted on being taken back to the 
airport because she wanted to fly to New York.

'She was saying, "I'm not going to rehab. I'm not going to rehab. Take me back to the airport,"' a source told The New York Daily News.

But Lindsay's desire to return to New York is likely a violation of her recent plea deal, which could lead to an arrest warrant being issued.

Orange County's finest: Police were seen surrounding Morningside as Lindsay checked in

'If
there’s credible confirmation she’s heading back to New York, then I’m 
going to have to go in and ask the court to issue a warrant,” Santa 
Monica City Attorney Terry White said.

And the actress' father Michael told Radar: 'If
that’s the case I have been told that she will be arrested in New York 
and her bail will be set at $100,000.'

Michael also told the Daily News that
he had spoken to Lindsay before the flight to New York took off, 
pleading with her not to get on it.

'She said, "Daddy, how can they arrest me?" I got her just before she left,' said Michael.

Final moments of freedom: On Wednesday Lindsay spent her last day before rehab shopping and chain-smoking

And in a bid to avoid an arrest 
warrant being issued, Lindsay is reported to have re-hired the lawyer 
she sensationally fired earlier this year.

TMZ reports that Lindsay has been unimpressed with Heller's work on her case, and pleaded ith Shawn Holley to return.

According to the website, Holley 
agreed to return as Lindsay's lawyer, and has since been talking to 
prosecutors in a bid to avoid them issuing a warrant for the actress' 
arrest.

As well as telling the judge that 
Lindsay had already checked into rehab, Heller also had to plead with 
the judge to get the okay that Morningside would be a suitable facility 
for the actress to complete her treatment in.

Revoked: The Newport Beach rehab centre allegedly can only act as a sober living facility and treat outpatients

Lindsay had originally been scheduled
to complete her 90-day treatment at the Seafield rehabilitation 
facility in New York after pleading no contest to charges of lying to police about driving 
during a car crash last June, but Michael appeared to have put the actress off 
the rehab centre.

'I
told her it’s like a motel, and you share a room and have a plastic 
shower curtain. You can’t smoke, you can’t leave the property. She said,
“What?!’” he told The New York Daily News.

Going to a different centre unapproved by the court technically broke her plea agreement, meaning the 
star’s attorney was required to appear before a judge.

Heller, who wore an eyesore of a tie in 
red and black stripes for the hearing, was attempting to convince Judge James R Dabney 
to approve of the switch.

In and out: Lindsay allegedly left the plush rehab facility after 'a few minutes'

He argued that as Lindsay has already
entered and is ‘ensconced’ in the program, it could effect her recovery should she have to move facilities.

‘She's
going to be meeting with a psychiatrist later today,’ Heller explained, 
reinforcing that the star is ‘commencing immediate treatment.'

The
news comes amid claims that the centre in fact does not even have a 
licence to offer residential treatment as it was revoked in May 2012.

According
to TMZ, Morningside had their licence suspended after they were found 
to be careless with prescription drugs and went beyond the constraints 
of the licence.

Looking out for Lindsay: Mark told Judge James R. Dabney that it would be a bad idea to move his client already

The Deputy Director of Licensing and 
Certificates at the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs 
told the website: ‘Morningside cannot give any treatment,’ as the rehab 
centre is allegedly only allowed to provide a sober living facility.

But
Morningside Recovery released a statement on Thursday claiming the 
facility does in fact have a licence to provide drug and alcohol 
treatment.

The facility's 
CEO Mary Helen Beatificato said the 2011 revocation of Morningside's 
licence only hinders the centre's ability to provide detox services to 
residents.

The
judge however didn’t seem to have too many qualms about the switch to 
that particular facility, despite the fact that it was not on a list
of six centres approved by the court.

Convincing: Lindsay chose a rehab centre which was not approved by the court so Mark was attempting to get the judge to OK the decision

Fighting his corner: The switch to a different rehab technically violates Lindsay's plea agreement and now the centre must be approved

‘It
does appear to comply,’ Judge Dabney said, adding that the prosecution 
had eight days to decide whether or not they will agree with the centre 
being approved.

‘I don't have any problems with Miss Lohan remaining in this program until the issue is resolved,’ he said.

‘If
we decide the program does not meet the requirements of the plea 
agreement then she will have to move to a different program.’

He
explained: 'The issue is going to be whether or not we need to set a 
hearing because the people are complaining [the centre] does not fit the
parameters.'

Heller and 
Terry White of the prosecution will reconvene in front of the judge on 
May 10, at which point it will be determined whether or not they will 
set a date for a restitution hearing.

Lindsay's lawyer said he has faith 
that Morningside would be approved, even though White claimed he had 
three separate news articles which showed the facility in a bad light.

'90 days and 270 looks': Lindsay posted a picture of herself packing for her stay in rehab on Instagram on Tuesday night

'If [White] says he's satisfied then I
don't think we have to come back,' Heller said, adding, 'I'm 100% sure 
he will be satisfied.'

Heller
then claimed that he will 'make sure [Lindsay] stays in therapy', and 
had called in the COO of Morningside in the hope that she could win over
White.

The judge later stated that Lindsay will not have to appear in court as the case continues 'as long as she is in compliance'.

In
addition, none of the star's progress reports are to be released to the
public aside from 'proof of completion' at the end of her stay.
