The last thing a Chinese man was looking for when he was out digging was a Marvel superhero. 

But that's exactly what Pan Yi found when he unearthed a kudzu vine tuber which looks uncannily like Groot from the Guardians of the Galaxy film.  

He was out digging with a friend deep in the mountains in Shiyan in central China's Hubei Province.

Kudzu's root, flower, and leaf have been used in traditional Chinese medicine since at least 200 BC. Groot (right) originally appeared as an invader of earth was reintroduced as a heroic, noble being in 2006

The tree-like humanoid was originally a Marvel comic book character before the 2014 film and first appeared in graphic novels in 1960. 

Groot originally appeared as an invader that intended to capture humans for experimentation but was reintroduced as a heroic, noble being in 2006.

The character certainly never appeared out of the ground in rural China. The unusually-shaped kudzu caused quite a stir and plenty of people were keen to pose with it.

The large tuber is practically the same size as Pan Yi himself, who was interviewed about his unusual find. 

Kudzu's root, flower, and leaf have been used in traditional Chinese medicine since at least 200 BC. 

Today, kudzu is used to treat alcoholism and to reduce symptoms of a hangover. 

It is also used for heart and circulatory problems, upper respiratory problems and skin problems.
