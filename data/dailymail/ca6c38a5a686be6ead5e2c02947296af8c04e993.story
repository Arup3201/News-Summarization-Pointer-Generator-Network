Children born to obese mothers are 50 per cent more likely to end up in hospital in the first five years of their lives.

A world-first study by researchers at Griffith University has followed almost 3,000 Queensland mothers and their children over a five-year period.

Researchers found conditions of the nervous system, infections, metabolic conditions, perinatal conditions, injuries and respiratory conditions were more prevalent in children of obese mothers.

Doctor Cate Cameron said the study, published in the International Journal Of Obesity, is good evidence pre-pregnancy weight has direct effect on complications when getting pregnant.

'We know that there are 1.5 times more hospital admissions in children born to obese mothers than to normal (weight) mothers,' she said.

Dr Cate Cameron said hopes the findings will lead to more funding to explore the reasons why there's a link between obese mothers and their children's health

'We found higher rates of infections and metabolic disorders that came through, but weight didn't seem to be the cause for higher rates of injuries and poisonings.'

Doctor Cameron hopes to now secure more funding so her team can analyse genetic material to find out why the health problems occur.

'There's no evidence long term. We have collected cord blood and now have the ability to do further study. We are just in the process of seeking further funding,' she said.

She also told Daily Mail Australia the results are not about blaming women.

'We've reached epidemic proportions in obesity,' she said.

'This is a way to help support women lose weight, not another reason to blame them. It's a good indication that we have the potential to reduce health care costs with studies like these, with a goal to achieve better health for us and our children.'

Children born to obese mothers are 50% more likely to be hospitalised.  'Pre-pregnancy weight has direct effect on complications when getting pregnant.'

Dr Gino Pecoraro, obstetrics spokesman for the Australian Medical Association, welcomed the findings and said they reinforced what we know from other studies.

'In a perfect world every pregnancy would be planned and safe with no medical illness, but that's not the case. From this study we want people to start talking about having children and working towards planning a birth,' she said.

Dr Pecoraro said women today are bombarded with a variety of information but education and knowledge to take action is a good thing.

'Whatever we can do as a nation to get people close to the right body weight and image is the best thing we can do. All mothers need to know how to be healthy,' she said.

'We want mothers to be at optimal weight and the study also shows some underweight mothers have problems too. Talk and education is the best thing in reassuring mums to be healthy.'

The study, which finds children with obese mum are more likely to be hospitalised in the first five years of their life, is not to blame mothers but to equip them with the information and knowledge to lead a healthy lifestyle.

Study co-author Professor Andrew Hills from the Mater Mothers' Hospital in Brisbane, also told ABC News the work was significant because the mothers and children were followed over a period of time.

'This is the million-dollar question. We appreciate that there are significantly heightened risks for folk carrying additional body weight at different stages at life but we know less about the exact mechanism,' he said.

Obesity has reached epidemic proportions globally, with at least 2.8 million people dying each year as a result of being overweight or obese.
