Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg head into the last round of the Formula One season in Abu Dhabi separated by just 17 points.

Ahead of the season finale, Sportsmail charters five key moments from a pulsating duel which has caught the imagination both on, and off, the track.

Bahrain Grand Prix (Hamilton 1st, Rosberg 2nd)

After Lewis Hamilton’s early retirement at the opening race of the season in Australia, and his dominant victory in Malaysia, the Battle in Bahrain – dubbed the ‘race of the century’ – gave us our first real taste of the incredible pace of the Mercedes. 

It also marked the first on-track battle between the pair as they went hammer and tong for 57 thrilling laps.

Rosberg, who started on pole, was the faster of the two drivers but was unable to make a move stick on his resilient team-mate. Hamilton won and landed the first psychological blow of the season.

The team-mates playfully sparred in parc ferme after the race but it was an opportunity missed for Rosberg, and he knew it. On the podium, he said: ‘I do not like coming second, especially to Lewis.’

Monaco Grand Prix (Hamilton 2nd, Rosberg 1st)

Hamilton’s triumph in Bahrain was the second of a four-race winning streak. Victories in China and then Spain, albeit finishing only six tenths of a second ahead of Rosberg, followed, seeing the Briton leapfrog his team-mate in the drivers’ standings. The momentum was firmly with the 2008 world champion.

Hamilton looked set to capture pole in Monte Carlo until he was forced to abort his final run after Rosberg went off the circuit at Mirabeau in the closing stages of qualifying.

Hamilton felt that Rosberg had parked his car deliberately in a bid to botch his best lap. He was livid but the race stewards found no evidence to support his claim. Rosberg started from pole and won the race. Of his relationship with his team-mate, Hamilton said, ‘We’re not friends, we’re colleagues’.

Belgium Grand Prix (Hamilton retired, Rosberg 2nd)

Rosberg spent the four-week summer break stewing over Hamilton’s failure to acknowledge a team instruction to allow him to pass at the previous race in Hungary. 

Mercedes’ refusal to publically address Hamilton’s apparent wrongdoing had also riled the German and his anxieties came to a head on lap two in Belgium.

He started the race on pole but lost the lead following a poor start. In an attempt to overtake Hamilton he made contact with the Briton’s rear-left tyre. Rosberg was left with a damaged front wing and Hamilton a debilitating puncture.

Rosberg recovered to finish second but Hamilton retired before firmly laying the blame for the collision at his team-mate’s door, claiming he’d crashed into him on purpose. 

The team’s failure to keep the fall-out behind closed doors resulted in a farcical fine for Rosberg, despite the stewards deeming the accident to be a racing incident, while he was also booed on the podium.

Italian Grand Prix (Hamilton 1st, Rosberg 2nd)

Hamilton and Rosberg were thrown together at the pre-race press conference at the next grand prix in Italy. While Rosberg was downbeat and apologetic, Hamilton appeared to revel in his role as victim.

Hamilton then secured pole some two tenths of a second ahead of his team-mate. A technical glitch at the start saw him slip down the pack but he went on to claim victory after Rosberg made two mistakes at Turn 1.

The conspiracy theorists claimed that Rosberg had deliberately gone off the track under instruction from Mercedes as further punishment for the incident in Belgium. Their voices gained credence when three-times world champion Sir Jackie Stewart, said: ‘I thought “hello, what’s going on here?” in reference to Rosberg’s gaffes.

While Rosberg and Mercedes flatly dismissed the claims it marked the first of five straight wins for Hamilton.

Brazilian Grand Prix (Hamilton 2nd, Rosberg 1st)

Hamilton’s emphatic run of results saw him move an emphatic 24 points clear of Rosberg with two races remaining. The German appeared down and out, low on confidence and seemingly unable to stop the Hamilton juggernaut.

But he responded in superb fashion in Brazil topping every session of practice and qualifying before claiming his first victory since July’s German Grand Prix.

It means that if Rosberg wins again on Sunday, Hamilton must finish second in order to win his first championship.

We’re all set for a thrilling conclusion.
