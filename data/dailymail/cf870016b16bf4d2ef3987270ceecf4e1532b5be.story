Three GP practices in England have been put into special measures after health inspectors deemed they are providing sub-standard care to patients.

The step is significant marking the first time GP surgeries have ever been subjected to the move by the Care Quality Commission.

The independent health and social care regulator said: 'It is the first time, and it is significant.'

The special measures, which come with help and support from officials, are a six-month warning for improvements to be made.

If steps are not taken to improve care to patients at the surgeries in Liverpool, Sale and Caversham, the CQC has the power to review the practice's registration, or ultimately, call for the practice to be shut down.

Three GP practices have been placed in special measures by the Care Quality Commission. It is significant as they are the first GP surgeries ever to be subjected to the measure.

Professor Nigel Sparrow, the CQC's senior national GP adviser, said: Patients should be able to expect high quality and consistent care from every GP practice.

'Where we have required improvement, we will expect the practice to take the necessary steps to address the issue, and we will return at a later date to check that those improvements have been made.

'Three of the five practices, which have been rated inadequate have been placed into special measures and have been offered a package of support by NHS England to help them improve.

'The other two practices have been told they will be put into special measures if they fail to improve.' 

The first of the three practices placed into special measures are Dharmana's Family and General Practice run by Dr Srinivas Dharmana in Walton, Liverpool.

Inspectors rated the surgery inadequate for being safe, effective, caring, responsive and well-led.

The second, Norris Road Surgery run by Dr Michael Florin in Sale, Trafford, was rated inadequate for being safe and well-led.

The surgery was seen as being good at caring for patients but needs improvement to be considered responsive and effective. 

Meanwhile The Priory Avenue Surgery in Caversham, Reading, was the third, also rated as inadequate for being safe, effective and well-led.

The CQC said it also needs improvement to be considered caring and responsive. 

Two other practices have been warned they will be placed in special measures if they fail to improve.

Three GP surgeries in England have been placed into special measures after CQC inspectors deemed the service they provide inadequate.

They are:

Two more practices have been rated inadequate and warned if they fail to improve they will be placed into special measures.

They are:

They were named as those surgeries run by Dr Sunil Srivastava, Richmond Medical Centre in Leeds, and the Widdrington Medical Practitioners in Widdrington, Northumberland. 

The Leeds practice is inadequate for being safe, effective, responsive and well-led and needs improvement to be caring while the Northumberland GP was deemed as inadequate for being safe and well-led. It was rated as good at being caring, responsive and effective. 

Patients registered with any of the practices put into special measures were told not to worry.

Help is being provided by NHS England and the Royal College of GPs (RCGP) and aims to ensure there are no immediate risks to patient safety.  

NHS England's deputy medical director Dr Mike Bewick said: 'General practice is the bedrock of the NHS and it's pleasing that the majority of practices inspected are rated good, with some rated outstanding.

'These inspections are about ensuring that every patient, anywhere across the country, receives consistently high quality services by identifying issues so improvements can be made. 

'And for those in special measures that need extra support, we are working with the GPs, Local Medical Committees and CCGs (Clinical Commissioning Group) to help turn the affected practices around, including the offer of additional support from the RCGP.' 

The CQC began inspecting the 8,500 GP practices in England last October.

They are all judged on five categories - according to whether they are safe, caring, effective, responsive and well-led - and rated as outstanding, good, requiring improvement or inadequate.

Of the 143 it has rated so far, six have been outstanding, 112 have been good, 20 have been judged to require improvement and five, including the three now in special measures, have been ruled 'inadequate'.

The Specialist Health Services (SHS) directors, who manage the Priory Avenue Surgery, accepted that they 'still need to put further work into improving the running and organisation' of the practice.

They wanted 'to reassure patients that patient care remains our top priority' and they would be 'redoubling our efforts' to improve under the watchful eye of NHS England (South Central), the North and West Reading CCG and the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP).

Five practices in total have been found to be inadequate since CQC inspectors began the process of rating each of the 8,500 GP practices in England. So far 143 have been inspected (file picture)

In a statement they said: 'We know that continuity of care is important to our patients and that improvements to our processes will help improve the running of the practice, so we ask that patients please continue to support us and please speak to us about any concerns they may have.'

The SHS directors said they had taken over a practice with many challenges but counted patients being seen on the same day if needed, introducing legionella testing and reviewing infection control processes along with increasing the number of GP sessions available among the signs that it has made progress.

Trafford Clinical Commissioning Group, which provides support and advice to primary care in Trafford, said of Dr Florin's surgery: 'Patients can be assured that the CCG is working with relevant agencies, including NHS England, to support the practice during the next six months and will ensure that the population of Sale receives locally delivered GP services which meet the required standard.

'In the meantime, patients of Norris Road Surgery can, during the period of special measures continue to receive their care at Norris Road Surgery in the same way.' 

A spokeswoman for Dr Dharmana said they did not want to comment. 

The British Medical Association (BMA) raised concerns at the CQC naming and shaming the five practices.

Chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul, said: 'It is encouraging that the vast majority of inspection reports returned good or outstanding ratings for GP practices. 

'This does demonstrate that GP practices across the country are delivering high quality, responsive care to their patients despite the incredible workload and funding pressures that GP services are facing.

'However, we remain concerned at the way the CQC continues to name and shame in public the small number of practices that the CQC deems to be having problems. 

'While any issues with patient care must be immediately resolved, it is not helpful that the CQC continues to pursue an inspection regime that is flawed in many aspects.

'For example, it is absurd that judgments are being made before physical inspections take place on a number of questionable indicators such as how many internal meetings a practice holds.

'We really must strive for a more robust and fair approach that maintains patient care while at the same time supporting and helping those practices that are struggling.'
