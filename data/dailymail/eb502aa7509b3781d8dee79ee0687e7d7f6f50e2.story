A Missouri inmate has been put to death for raping and killing a college student, making him the first U.S. prisoner put to death since the Arizona lethal injection went horrendously awry last month.

The Missouri Department of Corrections said Michael Worthington was executed by lethal injection at the state prison and was pronounced dead at 12.11am yesterday.

He is the seventh Missouri inmate to be executed this year.

Worthington had been sentenced to death for the attack on 24-year-old Melinda 'Mindy' Griffin during a burglary of her Lake St Louis condominium in 1995.

Offered no apology: Michael Worthington was executed in Missouri for raping and killing a student despite an appeal to the Supreme Court to delay the death sentence because of recent botched executions

Before the execution began, while 
strapped to a gurney and covered with a sheet, Worthington spoke with 
his witnesses — some of them his relatives — through the glass, raising 
his shaved head.

When the 
drugs began flowing, his head lowered back to the pillow and he appeared
 to breathe heavily for about 15 seconds before closing his eyes.

Some 
of his witnesses began crying after he fell unconscious.

A Bible had been placed on his chest at his request, and he left a six-sentence written statement offering no apology.

The U.S. Supreme Court and Missouri's governor had declined on Tuesday to block the execution.

Worthington,
 43, had predicted that the nation's high court and Governor Jay Nixon would
 not spare him, insisting in a telephone interview with The Associated 
Press news agency that he had accepted his fate.

'I
 figure I'll wake up in a better place tomorrow,' Worthington, formerly 
of Peoria in central Illinois, had said Tuesday.

'I'm just accepting of 
whatever's going to happen because I have no choice. The courts don't 
seem to care about what's right or wrong anymore.'

Killer: Joseph Wood gasped for two hours when was executed by lethal injection in Arizona last month

Worthington's
 attorneys had pressed the Supreme Court to put off his execution, 
citing the Arizona execution and two others that were botched in Ohio 
and Oklahoma as well as the secrecy involving the drugs used during the
 process in Missouri.

Those 
three executions in recent months have renewed the debate over lethal 
injection.

In Arizona, the inmate gasped more than 600 times and took 
nearly two hours to die.

In April, an Oklahoma inmate died of an 
apparent heart attack 43 minutes after his execution began.

And in 
January, an Ohio inmate snorted and gasped for 26 minutes before dying. 
Most lethal injections take effect in a fraction of that time, often 
within 10 or 15 minutes.

Arizona,
 Oklahoma and Ohio all use midazolam, a drug more commonly given to help
 patients relax before surgery. In executions, it is part of a two- or 
three-drug lethal injection.

Texas
 and Missouri instead administer a single large dose of pentobarbital — 
often used to treat convulsions and seizures and to euthanize animals.

Missouri changed to pentobarbital late last year and since has carried 
out executions during which inmates showed no obvious signs of distress.

Missouri
 and Texas have turned to compounding pharmacies to make versions of 
pentobarbital. But like most states, they refuse to name their drug 
suppliers, creating a shroud of secrecy that has prompted lawsuits.

In
 denying Worthington's clemency request, Nixon called Worthington's rape
 and killing of Griffin 'horrific,' noting that 'there is no question 
about the brutality of this crime — or doubt of Michael Worthington's 
guilt.'

Worthington was 
sentenced to death in 1998 after pleading guilty to Griffin's death, 
confessing that in September 1995 he cut open a window screen to break 
in to the college finance major's condominium in Lake St. Louis, just 
west of St. Louis.

Worthington admitted he choked Griffin into 
submission and raped her before strangling her when she regained 
consciousness. He stole her car keys and jewelry, along with credit 
cards he used to buy drugs.

DNA tests later linked Worthington to the slaying.

Worthington,
 much as he did after his arrest, insisted to the AP on Tuesday from his
 holding cell near the death chamber that he couldn't remember details 
of the killing and that he was prone to blackouts due to alcohol and 
cocaine abuse.

He said a life prison sentence would have been more 
appropriate for him.

'In 20 
years, no one's seen or heard from me,' he said. 'If I'm the one who did
 it, what do they think life without parole is — a piece of cake?

On Tuesday, Griffin's 76-year-old parents anticipated witnessing Worthington die.

'It's
 been 19 years, and I feel like there's going to be a finality,' 
Griffin's mother, Carol Angelbeck said after flying to Missouri
 from their Florida home.

'I won't have to ever deal
 with the name Michael Worthington again. I'm hoping for my family's 
sake, my sake, that we can go there (to the prison) and get this over 
with.'

'In this case, there 
is no question in anyone's mind he did it, so why does it take 18 or 19 
years to go through with this?' added Jack Angelbeck, Griffin's father.

'This drags on and on. At this point, it's ridiculous, and hopefully 
it's going to end.'

Worthington, when asked what he would say to Griffin's parents, directed his comments to her mother.

'If
 my life would bring her peace and bring Mindy back, I'd be fine with 
that.

But it won't,' he said. 'It doesn't bring peace or closure. She's 
still going to have her broken heart.'
