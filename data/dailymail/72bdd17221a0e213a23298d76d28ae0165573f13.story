An insurance executive has been found guilty of DUI manslaughter in the gory 2010 death of 22-year-old Miami Heat dancer Nancy Lopez-Ruiz.

Mario Careaga, 46, of Fort Lauderdale, was immediately taken into custody Thursday after the ruling by Broward Circuit Judge Ilona M. Holmes. He is scheduled for sentencing on May 5, and faces between four and 15 years in prison.

Lopez-Ruiz's family sobbed in court Wednesday, after the all-male jury delivered its guilty verdict following 10 hours of deliberations.

However, that decision as immediately questioned after an alternate juror, who had been dismissed from the case, accused another juror of exhibiting an anti-gay bias during the trial.

Carrega is gay and his partner of 20 years, Ray Stapleton, gave testimony.

On Thursday, Stapleton urged the public Thursday to continue praying for the victim's family.

'They're good people,' he said, according to the Sun Sentinel.

Careaga crashed his Mercedes into the victim who had stopped her motorcycle on the side of the road in Fort Lauderdale at 9:38 p.m. on September 10, 2010, sending her flying more than 130 feet into the air.

One juror was accused of mocking the Cargeaga's voice as he testified and using an expletive to describe Bogenschutz.

The alternate juror told defense lawyer David Bogenschutz Tuesday he thought this could affect the outcome of the trial. Bogenschutz brought the allegations to Judge Holmes on Tuesday afternoon.

The Sentinel reported that after Wednesday's verdict, Holmes spoke with each juror individually to ask whether they heard or said anything disparaging about gays - non of them had.

Justice: Nancy Lopez-Ruiz' mother, Adela, pictured Thursday, said she feels justice has been served

Relieved: The dancer's family were relieved with the verdict

The juror denied both accusations, instead saying he had been clearing his throat during Careaga's testimony.

Nevertheless, the judge decided to hold off on formally entering the jury's verdict until Thursday morning. But in the end she decided against declaring a mistrial and upheld the verdict.

Clutched a figurine of an angel she'd received from her daughter, the victim's mother, Adela Lopez-Ruiz, talked of her relief.

'Justice came for Nancy,' she said, according to the Sentinel. 'We trust the justice system, and we are pleased that justice was served.'

She has been a vocal opponent to drink driving since her daughter's death.

At the beginning of the trial, Adela sobbed as she told reporters, 'I have no words to express the pain' of losing her daughter.

The beautiful 22-year-old was killed after she pulled over her Suzuki sport motorcycle on the side of the road and Careaga crossed three lanes of traffic in his white 2009 Mercedes-Benz, slamming into her.

She was pronounced dead at the scene.

'For a mother, for a father, yes, it is very, very hard,' Adela Lopez told wsvn.com.

'It's in the hands of the people who serve justice. We are anticipating that justice will be served.'

Her father, Armando, added that seeing his daughter's alleged killer for the first time was 'very hard.'

The
 cheerleader grew up in the Bradenton area and was a college student 
living in Plantation when she tried out and won a spot as a Miami Heat 
dancer. She was supposed to start performing publicly in October 2010.

On the night of the deadly crash she was reportedly coming home from practice.

Meanwhile, Careaga, a wealthy insurance executive, was spotted at an event at a nearby mall shopping for jewellery with a glass of champagne in his hand just one hour before the collision.

According to police, his blood alcohol level was more than twice the legal limit, at .23 and .24 percent.

According to responding police, he was 'swaying from side to side and in a circular motion.'

They also said he had 'bloodshot, 
glassy eyes, slurred speech, the odor of alcoholic beverages coming from
 his person, unsteady balance and difficulty supporting himself.'

A video of the crash was shown to jurors.

In court on during the trial, Careago looked uncomfortable. He has been free on bond as he awaited his trial, which has faced repeated delays.
