Four people are being treated in hospital after the upper deck of a car ferry collapsed on to the level below as passengers disembarked.

The forward mezzanine deck, carrying nine cars, gave way after the ferry docked at Fishbourne terminal on the Isle of Wight just before 10.30pm yesterday.

Three passengers and one crew member were taken to St Mary's Hospital in Newport with non-life-threatening injuries.

The incident occurred on the Wightlink 
Ferries St Helen car ferry, which sailed at 9.30pm from Portsmouth to 
the Isle of Wight with 181 passengers and 11 crew onboard.

Paramedics, police, fire crews and the coastguard were called to Fishbourne Terminal, where they found four people suffering from a 'variety of injuries'.

Wightlink Ferries spokesman Karen Woods said the mezzanine deck on the starboard side 'dropped a few feet and made contact with the lower deck' as it was being lowered during 'the usual disembarkation process'.

She added that vehicles on the lower deck had already left the ferry when the incident occurred.

'One member of the crew and three passengers have been taken to St Mary's Hospital by ambulance,' she said.

'The
 Isle of Wight ambulance service has confirmed none of the injuries are 
life-threatening. A member of Wightlink's staff attended the hospital to
 aid and support customers.'

It is not known whether those injured were in cars on the mezzanine deck or the level beneath it.

A full investigation is under way and the incident has been reported to the Marine Accident Investigation Branch.

A spokesman for the Isle of Wight Ambulance Service said the patients were being treated for 'a variety of injuries', and all were 'conscious and breathing' when they were taken from the scene.

He said: 'We are not aware of the nature of the injuries. It is very fortunate that it was only four people injured, all things considered.'

Portsmouth police last night warned of delays for people hoping to travel to the Isle of Wight from the city because of the incident.

Wightlink Ferries said the St Helen car ferry is inspected regularly by external surveyors and had previously undergone an engineering survey, including its mezzanine decks, in May following its annual refit.
