A convicted murderer who was freed early from jail before he stabbed a mother to death in front of two police officers was told he would die behind bars today.

Paul O’Hara, 43,  burst into the home of his terrified girlfriend Cherylee Shennan while the detectives were taking a statement about the vicious beatings he gave her.

Despite the officers being there, he ran at the 40-year-old, from Greater Manchester, with a hammer and started battering her.

The two officers desperately tried to fend off O'Hara and protect Miss Shennan.

But as one of them tried to help her escape, O’Hara caught up with them and 'finished off' his lover by calmly stabbing her five times in the street.

Paramedics had to work quickly to remove her body from the scene because Ms Shennan’s 12-year-old daughter had been due home from school at any time. 

In a statement the victim’s family said: 'Our family has been torn apart and tormented by this tragedy and our lives will never be the same again.  

'Cherylee will always be loved and we will hold cherished memories forever in our hearts. She will never be forgotten by her family, friends and all that knew her.'  

The killing in Rawtenstall, Lancashire, occurred two years after O’Hara had been freed on licence having served 14 years of a life sentence for murdering another girlfriend in 1998.

The career criminal had a string of convictions for violence dating back to 1989. 

Loss: O'Hara and Miss Shennan. The court heard how O'Hara, from Heywood, near Rochdale had a 'personality disorder' which fuelled violent rages

When questioned by police he said, 'There’s no point interviewing me I’m not going to say anything' before admitting his motive for murder was because he thought the police were about to recall him to prison.

He added: 'She was running down the street scared s**tless. Why didn’t the police help her?'

Today Judge Anthony Russell QC ordered O’Hara to serve a whole life term after he admitted murder plus separate charges of wounding one of the officers with intent and assault with intent to resist arrest.

The judge praised the two officers for their 'commendable courage' and told O’Hara he would never be released adding: 'This was indeed a most brutal and savage attack.

'You are a very dangerous man, particularly to women with whom you form a relationship.'

Earlier 
Preston Crown Court heard how O’Hara, from Heywood, near Rochdale had a 
'personality disorder' which fuelled violent rages.

After
 spells in and out of jail he stabbed former girlfriend Janine 
Waterworth, 21, to death just three days after she ended their 
relationship.

Judge Anthony Russell QC ordered O'Hara to serve a whole life term at Preston Crown Court

Ms Waterworth was knifed 12 times in an ambush close to a bus stop near her home in Oldham after O’Hara armed himself with his grandmother’s carving knife and waited in an alleyway which she used to go to work.

Tests showed she had six knife wounds to the front and six to the back of the body and she died at the scene.

O’Hara later confessed, saying he had lost his temper in the jealous belief she was seeing someone else. In November 1998 he was jailed for for life but was freed on licence in April 2012 having served 14 years.

He got a job at a second hand furniture store which 40-year old mother-of-one Ms Shennan ran with her long term partner and a year later they began an affair.

Graham Reeds QC prosecuting said the victim was popular and friendly. He added: 'But it is accurate to say that friends and neighbours noticed that after O’Hara’s visits to her home became more frequent she started to become more reluctant to leave the house.'

The first incident that there was violence in the relationship came at the start of November. Her mother Betty and stepfather Johnny went to her house for a bonfire party and found her with a black eye and broken nose. She said she had fallen down the stairs when drunk.

Shortly after Christmas Cherylee’s friend Linda Slade came to visit and saw the injuries. The defendant was also present and appeared tense and she said she had fallen down the stairs.

Mr Reeds added: 'She later told her friend that he had fractured her jaw and he had threatened her with a knife on two separate occasions. The friend advised her to disengage from him slowly.'

In March her mother and stepfather heard of the incident and went to her house to see for themselves, the stepfather rang the police and they arrived at the house.

In 1989 sent to young offender’s institute for a variety of offences.

In 1991 again sent to young offender’s institute for assault occasioning actual body harm after he hit a person with a baseball bat in the course of a fight.

In 1993 he was sent to prison for burglary of a house and when police arrived at the scene he assaulted a police officer.

In 1994 he was convicted of assault of a police officer and sent to prison for five months by Oldham Magistrates.

In 1994 at Manchester Crown sent to prison for two years for wounding and GBH. This involved him arguing with two women and he wounded one of them and broke the arm of another by throwing her to the floor. Sent to prison for two years.

In 1998 he was sentenced to life in prison for murder. The victim was his girlfriend Janine Waterworth and their relationship finished a few days prior to her death.

When police arrived she broke down crying she told them that he had fractured her cheekbone fracture a couple of weeks previously and she had been to hospital. But she insisted she didn’t want any action taken against him.

The court heard that O’Hara went round to Cherylee’s house on March 17 when two police officers were attending over reported domestic abuse against her.

He came into the house shortly after police arrived and was armed with a claw hammer inside a plastic bag. Detective Sergeant Damien McAlister and Detective Constable Karen Kenworthy tried to calm O’Hara down but he started to attack Ms Shennan with the hammer.

The court heard that Ms Shennan broke free and went to the back of the house but O’Hara caught up with her and started to strangle her.

The police managed to hit him again and one of the officers got her out of the house. O’Hara then went into her kitchen and took a knife and barged through furniture blocking the front door.

He chased Ms Shennan and one of the officers but they couldn’t run very fast as they were injured.

He caught up to Ms Shennan who was on the floor and stabbed her five times.

Witness, Scott Talbot, described the stabbing as 'controlled'.

'Each stab seemed more slow, in and out in a controlled action. After he pulled the knife out it then went in again,' he said.

O’Hara was eventually confronted in a nearby garden still armed with the knife and was overpowered with CS spray. Tests showed Cherylee had been stabbed five times in the face, forearm and chest.

Det Con Kenworthy said she had never been involved in 'such a frightening or horrific incident in 22 years service'. She had bruising to several places on her body but was able to return to work.

Sgt McAllister had a two inch laceration to his forehead and puncture wounds to his temple and bridge of his nose which required 20 stitches. He later said he felt more upset he had not been able to get Ms Shennan away.

In mitigation for O’Hara, defence counsel Tony Cross QC said: 'These are very grave crimes and the grim reality of the defendant’s position is the mitigation is his guilty plea to the murder and the guilty pleas to the other matters.'

Speaking after the hearing Detective Supt Eddie Thistlethwaite, of Lancashire Constabulary’s Force Major Investigation Team, led the inquiry.

He said: 'This was a truly horrendous incident which cost a young woman her life. O’Hara is a predatory and violent individual who manipulated his victims including Cherylee, praying on their craving for love and attention.

'He has shown no or little remorse throughout this process and his actions fully justify the sentence which has been imposed.

'I would like to thank the Crown Prosecution Service and Counsel for all their hard work which has resulted in today’s guilty pleas. O’Hara’s admission has at least spared the families the ordeal of having to re-live these tragic events through a trial.

'I would also like to praise the bravery of all police officers, PCSOs, and paramedics who attended what was a horrific scene.

'Special thanks must go to Detective Sergeant Damien McAlister and Detective Constable Karen Kenworthy who fought with O’Hara in the vain attempt to save the life of Cherylee.

Our thoughts and prayers remain with the family and friends of Cherylee. They have shown enormous dignity and bravery throughout this ordeal.
