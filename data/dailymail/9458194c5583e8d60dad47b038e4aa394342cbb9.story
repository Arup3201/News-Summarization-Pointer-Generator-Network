Zlatan Ibrahimovic has been told he can leave France by the nation's far right National Front leader Marine Le Pen.  

Ibrahimovic branded the referee of his side's 3-2 Ligue 1 defeat against Bordeaux as 's***' and said that France doesn't deserve Paris Saint-Germain.

The 33-year-old was caught on camera by infosport+ after the defeat against Bordeaux halted the defending champions' charge for the French title.

Ibrahimovic reacted angrily to the defeat and said it was the worst refereeing display he'd ever seen

The Swedish striker claimed that France doesn't deserve the Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain

Speaking in English but in partial sentences, the Sweden striker can be heard saying: 'He's an a******. Play 15 years, never seen referee this s*** country. Don't even deserve PSG should be in this country. F****** too good for all of you. Should be happy they exist.'

Despite apologising for his actions, Ibrahimovic has now been told he should leave France by Le Pen.

The National Front Leader told France Info Radio: 'Those who consider that France is a s*** country can leave it. It's as simple as that.'

The former Barcelona and Inter Milan hitman took to his social media sites to clarify his comments.

Ibrahimovic said: 'Regarding my comments after tonight’s game; they were not against France or the French people. I spoke about football.

'I lost the game, I accept that but I can’t accept when the referee doesn’t follow the rules. It’s not the first time and I’m sick of it. My sincere apologies if anyone was offended or took it the wrong way.'

Ibrahimovic had twice equalised for PSG in Bordeaux, the first from a Javier Pastore (second right) pass
