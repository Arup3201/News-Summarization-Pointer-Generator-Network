Jailed: Bodyguard Christopher Cooknell, 54, made threats to kill his boss and his family in order to secure a pay rise

A private security guard deliberately set out to make the family that employed him fear for their lives in a desperately cruel bid to win a pay rise and promotion.

Christopher Cooknell, 54, sent an anonymous letter and a number of text messages to victim Daniel Holloway, threatening to kill him and his family.

The sick threats terrified the family, who as a result promoted Cooknell and increased his salary.

On Tuesday at Basildon Crown Court judge David Owen-Jones sentenced Cooknell to three years in jail after he had admitted at a previeous hearing to fraud and making threats to kill.

After sentencing, Senior Investigating Officer, DCI Lucy Robinson, said: ‘Christopher Cooknell is a dangerous man in that he fails to fully comprehend the implications of his actions.

‘He has caused a great deal of suffering to the victim and his family by sending distressing text messages, and his actions have also resulted in two innocent men being arrested for no reason.

‘His motivation appears to be entirely for selfish financial gain and I have no doubt that had his text messages been allowed to continue he would have become increasingly greedy and sought to demand money from Mr Holloway.

‘Thankfully it never came to this, but I hope his sentence today reflects the seriousness of his actions.’

Cooknell, from Ryde on the Isle of Wight, was part of a security team first employed to help protect Mr Holloway’s family following an aggravated burglary at their family estate in Brentwood, Essex, in June 2009.

In August 2011, Cooknell sent an anonymous letter threatening a further burglary, at gunpoint, at the home.

The letter also resulted in the arrest of two innocent gardeners who he had falsely implicated in the original break-in.

Cooknell has since admitted his part in sending the letter, which he had hoped would result in the gardeners being sacked. No evidence was found linking the gardeners to the burglary.

Cooknell then went onto to send anonymous death threats in December last year 2012 from a mobile phone that police later traced back to him.

Shameless Cooknell claimed the messages had simply been a ‘prank’ but later admitted making threats to kill and fraud.

Verdict: Cooknell was sentenced to three years in jail at Basildon Crown Court (pictured)
