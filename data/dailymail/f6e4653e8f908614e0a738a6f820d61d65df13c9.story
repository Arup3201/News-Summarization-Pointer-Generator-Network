She is known for her measured tones as she runs through the day’s events on her Radio 4 show each lunchtime.

But, if any of Martha Kearney’s loyal listeners were in earshot yesterday morning, they may have been shocked to hear far bluer language. 

Miss Kearney, 56, admitted on yesterday’s show that her calm demeanour had given way to a fit of road rage on her daily commute.

Martha Kearney admitted to losing her cool when she and a fellow cyclist came to blows while commuting to work

The World at One presenter, who leaves her Fulham home at 6.30am to cycle to the BBC’s Broadcasting House, said: ‘This morning, I ended up in a road rage incident with another very self-righteous cyclist and we ended up swearing at each other in very un-Radio 4 like language.’

The episode discussed how people should commute to work, after University of East Anglia research found that people who walk, cycle or use public transport are happier than those who drive.

Motoring journalist Steve Berry, a guest on the programme, said: ‘Walk or drive, it’s preferable to the legion of sweaty cyclists, who seem to think it’s alright to arrive at the office perspiring profusely and then spend all day sat next to you.’
