Stan Collymore, who attracts more controversy away from football than any other mainstream pundit, appears at Warrington magistrates court on Thursday morning charged with four driving offences.

Collymore, talkSPORT’s lead football expert, drove his Porsche at around 10mph in excess of the various speed limits. He already has three points on his driving license according to court documents and risks a long driving ban.

However, Collymore, who recently incited a protest from South Atlantic war veterans by making a crass tweet about the Falklands, is being represented by celebrity solicitor Mark Haslam, who specialises in road traffic cases and has a number of footballers as clients.

It is expected Collymore will follow the example of Freddie Flintoff, who escaped a driving ban last August by claiming it would seriously hamper his charity work.

The latest of almost daily revelations emanating from Leeds United is that former club owners GFH Capital claim to have sworn witness statements by bank compliance officers that the former Leeds managing director David Haigh deposited around 100 false invoices for over £4m into four accounts held in London, Dubai and Manchester. A spokesman for Haigh, who has spent 136 days in prison in Dubai, said: ‘David continues to maintain his complete innocence.’

Former Kent captain David Fulton summed up the game’s low opinion of the ECB’s decision to charge Yorkshire captain Andrew Gale with racist abuse.

In his speech at the Cricket Writers’ Awards, Fulton (right) parodied what Gale said to Ashwell Prince, saying: ‘If there are any Australians in the room, can you f*** off back to your own country.’

lt is hard to fathom why the RFU have given England manager Stuart Lancaster and his coaching staff extended six-year contracts until after the 2019 World Cup when everything depends on how they do in the tournament on home soil in 2015. Fears that they may be poached or a desire at Twickenham for long-term continuity will be irrelevant if England fail to get out of their difficult World Cup group. 

And the RFU will not reveal whether the contracts have get-out clauses. Chief executive Ian Ritchie, who made the contract recommendations that the board approved, said: ‘We are not going into the details. There is ongoing assessment about the team’s performance, but we have absolute faith in Stuart and his team.’

Royal St George’s Golf Club look certain to follow the example of the R&A, who have voted to admit female members for the first time.

The Sandwich-based club, who hosted the Open in 2011, when former Minister for Sport Hugh Robertson led the chorus of disapproval of their male-only membership, have already canvassed members’ views ahead of an official ballot at the start of next year.

It is understood the vast majority agreed when consulted that women should finally be allowed in after 127 years. Club secretary Tim Checketts said: ‘I imagine that to be the case, but we need to hold a proper ballot and consider all the ramifications.’

The opinions of Rio Ferdinand have been given extra credence since the FA revealed they may put him forward next year as the English candidate for the vacant British vice-presidency on the FIFA executive. And Ferdinand neatly summed up the main obstacle to English success at international level in the Facebook-launched excerpt from his new book #2sides. 

Rio writes: ‘The Premier League is completely detached from the ideas and vision of the FA and vice versa. The barrier has to be broken down. The big clubs have very little interest in the national team. All they care about is what benefits them and they think mainly in terms of money. The FA is not strong enough to decide a policy and dictate from the centre.’
