At the height of the Cold War, former Labour cabinet minister Tony Benn was considered by the Soviet Union an 'unnecessary simpleton' who was too stupid to recruit as an agent,  a KGB defector has claimed.

Oleg Gordievsky, who was tasked with spying for the KGB while posted in London as a resident designate in the 1980s, warned his colleagues that if elected deputy-leader of the Labour party, Benn would ruin the Cold War political balance.

Although tasked with running a Soviet intelligence operation from London, Mr Gordievsky had in fact worked for MI6 since 1974.

This led to him being named a Companion of the Most Distinguished Order in the 2007 Queen's Birthday Honours for his assistance to British national security.

But in an interview with The Telegraph, Mr Gordievsky has now claimed Benn was ignored by Soviet diplomats as a potential source because he was unreliable and made false claims.

During a 1983 meeting with Soviet ambassador Viktor Popov, Mr Gordievsky was told to be aware of Benn who was considered 'not truthful'.

Mr Gordievsky said: 'He was an unnecessary simpleton, who told left-wing fairytales and falsified stories.'

He added that two years earlier he had prevented Soviet intelligence officials from supporting Benn in the Labour leadership contest and sent memos to Moscow warning it would be 'catastrophic' for Europe's political balance if Benn was elected.

Benn died in March at the age of 88.

He was described as the 'most dangerous man in Britain' in the 1980s, but was voted the UK's 'political hero' by viewers of the BBC's Daily Politics programme in 2007.

He joined the Labour Party in 1943, and became an MP seven years later, winning the Bristol South-East by-election after the death of Sir Stafford Cripps in 1950.

Fairly moderate at the start, Benn's political views became more extreme to the left as his career progressed, until, by the time he retired in 2001 'to devote more time to politics', he was one of the most radical politicians in his party.

He put forward the Commonwealth of Britain Bill to abolish the monarchy in 1992.

In later life, Benn was appointed President of Stop the War Coalition and campaigned vigorously against the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
