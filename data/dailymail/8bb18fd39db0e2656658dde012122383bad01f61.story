Manchester United's new signing Radamel Falcao has revealed that he will be fulfilling a dream by playing in the Premier League this season.

The Colombian striker sealed a shock £6million season-long move to United on Monday and will wear the No 9 shirt for Louis van Gaal's side.

Speaking to MUTV, Falcao said: 'I am very happy to be part of this big club. I’ve waited for this moment during a lot of the year. Now I am a player of Manchester United.

'For me, it was a dream to play in the Premier League. I always wanted to be here because this league is very good, it has very good teams and Manchester United is the best team in England.'

Falcao joins from Monaco where he scored 13 goals in 22 appearances last season before a knee injury ruled him out of the 2014 World Cup.

United fans had to wait until 1:30am on Tuesday morning for Falcao to be officially unveiled after a day which saw the Colombian arrive at Manchester airport shortly before 6pm as the Red Devils smashed the £160m barrier for the summer of spending under Van Gaal.

The 28-year-old striker added: 'It was a very long day. It was hard, difficult. We were waiting until the last minute but I didn’t lose my faith.

'Now I want to say thank you to God for this. I’m very happy.'

£147.1m - Amount spent by United in the summer transfer window, more than any other team in the country

200 - Goals scored by Falcao during his club career

£10m - United’s net spend this summer is around £10million higher than Jose Mourinho’s entire net spend in his two spells at Chelsea

7 - United have signed seven players this summer, the most in one window since the summer of 2007

0.66 - Falcao’s goals per game rate in his club career, much better than the PL’s top strikers.

Aguero 0.48, Van Persie 0.47, Rooney 0.45, Dzeko 0.44, Giroud 0.42, Sturridge 0.39, Balotelli 0.39, Costa 0.38
