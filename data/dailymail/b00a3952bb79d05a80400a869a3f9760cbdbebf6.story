The parents of murdered U.S. hostage Abdul-Rahman Kassig said today that they would forgive his ISIS terrorist killers.

Ed and Paula Kassig made a short statement on Monday afternoon at their church in Indianapolis after it was confirmed that the extremists had beheaded their 26-year-old son, following a review of an ISIS video released on Sunday.

Mr and Mrs Kassig said 'our hearts are battered but they will mend' and asked people around the world to pray for their son.

Ed and Paula Kassig, parents of Peter Kassig, made a short statement on Monday at their home in Indianapolis after learning of their son's death at the hands of ISIS extremists

'In 26 years, he has witnessed and experienced firsthand more of the harsh realities of life than most of us can imagine," Paula Kassig said of her son, Peter, who changed his first name to Abdul-Rahman after converting to Islam during captivity. 

'But rather than letting the darkness overwhelm him, he has chosen to believe in the good — in himself and in others.

'Peter's life is evidence that he's been right all along — one person can make a difference.'

The aid worker and former U.S. Army Ranger was captured October 1, 2013, while delivering aid in Syria through a relief organization he founded. 

The White House confirmed Kassig's death on Sunday after the Islamic State group released a video showing that Kassig had been beheaded.

The slain hostage's parents said they were 'heartbroken' by their son's killing, but 'incredibly proud' of his humanitarian work. 

Kassig 'lost his life as a result of his love for the Syrian people and his desire to ease their suffering,' the parents said.

With Kassig's death, the Islamic State group has killed five Westerners it was holding.

American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff were beheaded, as were British aid workers David Haines and Alan Henning. 

President Obama confirmed Kassig's slaying on Sunday after a U.S. review of the video, which also showed the mass beheadings of a dozen Syrian soldiers.

Kassig 'was taken from us in an act of pure evil by a terrorist group that the world rightly associates with inhumanity,' Obama said in a statement.

Unlike previous videos of slain Western hostages, the footage released Sunday did not show the decapitation of Kassig or the moments leading up to his death. 

The footage released Sunday identifies the militants' location as Dabiq, a town in northern Syria that the Islamic State group uses as the title of its English-language propaganda magazine and where they believe an apocalyptic battle between Muslims and their enemies will occur.

The high-definition video also showed the beheadings of about a dozen men identified as Syrian military officers and pilots, all dressed in blue jumpsuits. The black-clad militant warns that U.S. soldiers will meet a similar fate.

'We say to you, Obama: You claim to have withdrawn from Iraq four years ago,' the militant said. 'Here you are: You have not withdrawn. Rather, you hid some of your forces behind your proxies.' 

A U.S.-led coalition is targeting the Islamic State group in airstrikes, supporting Western-backed Syrian rebels, Kurdish fighters and the Iraqi military.

Kassig, who served in the U.S. Army's 75th Ranger Regiment, a special operations unit, deployed to Iraq in 2007. After being medically discharged, he returned to the Middle East in 2012 and  formed a relief group, Special Emergency Response and Assistance, to aid Syrian refugees.

A certified EMT, Kassig had delivered food and medical supplies and provided trauma care to wounded Syrians before being captured in eastern Syria on Oct. 1, 2013. Friends say he converted to Islam in captivity and took the first name Abdul-Rahman.

In a statement issued as he flew back to Washington from the Asia-Pacific region, Obama said Kassig 'was a humanitarian who worked to save the lives of Syrians injured and dispossessed' by war. The president offered prayers and condolences to Kassig's family.

'We cannot begin to imagine their anguish at this painful time,' he said.
