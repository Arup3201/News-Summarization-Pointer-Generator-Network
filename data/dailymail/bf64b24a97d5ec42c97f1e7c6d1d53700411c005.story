A Dubai man convicted of killing his girlfriend has been described by his lawyer as the ‘most stupid murderer I have seen in 40 years’.

The unnamed man, a cook for a top government official, bludgeoned his girlfriend, the neighbour's maid, to death with a stone after she said she was pregnant and threatened to accuse him of rape – despite the fact that the pair had never had sex.

The man, an Indian national, then put the body in a bathtub, filled it with water and proceeded to set the house on fire to cover his tracks.

Although the villa burned down, the bathtub full of water was left unharmed, as was the girlfriend’s body, preserved in the water.

The man was arrested for the 2010 murder after asking his employer to help him flee the country, who reported him to the police.

The lawyer told a Dubai court his client was the ‘most stupid murderer I have seen in 40 years’.

The man is currently awaiting a sentence while Dubai authorities struggle to find the relatives of the murdered woman.

United Arab Emirates law says the man cannot be sentenced before the murdered woman's family has been asked whether they want him to be sentenced to death or will accept blood money.
