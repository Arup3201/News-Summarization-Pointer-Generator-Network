Victim: Roger Pratt (left) was murdered on his yacht while celebrating his wife Margaret's (right) birthday

Three men are set to be charged with the murder of the Briton who was bludgeoned and drowned while on a round-the-world yachting adventure to celebrate his wife's 60th birthday.

Autopsy results revealed Roger Pratt’s death in St Lucia was caused by 'asphyxiation, secondary to blunt force trauma.'

Police said three men, in their 20s, were co-operating with the inquiry and set to be charged.

Speaking for the first time since her husband’s death, Mr Pratt’s widow, Margaret, who was left badly bruised and needing facial stitches in the savage attack, said she and her husband had not suspected any danger on the Caribbean Island - until her husband's slaughter.

'We had not felt unsafe in St Lucia until the events of those final tragic minutes,' said Mrs Pratt, who came under siege with her husband when three robbers boarded their boat, beat Mr Pratt and left his lifeless body floating in the ocean.

Mr and Mrs Pratt, who left Lowestoft in Suffolk last July both attempted to defend themselves during the violent attack on their 41ft yacht, Magnetic Attraction.

Sources from the Vieux Fort region suggested that Mrs Pratt scratched at the assailants' faces and bit one of their fingers, as she and her husband tried to protect themselves.

Mr Pratt, 62, was thrown into the sea by the attackers, who fled in a small rowing boat. He was not stabbed as previous police reports suggested.

'One of the suspects had deep bite marks on his finger and they all has scratches on their faces,' said a local source from the low-income 'shanty town' region of Bruce Ville.

Local reports alleged that a notorious gang called the Pepper Yard Crew may have been responsible for the murder.

The group of unemployed males are known for causing trouble in the local community in Vieux Fort, a port in the southern most tip of the island.

'They carry guns on their waist or in their hands in broad daylight to intimidate people, they are very feared,' said a local who did not wish to be named for fear of retribution.

Vernon Francois, the commissioner of the island’s police force, said: 'This appears to have been intended as a robbery and went out of control.'

Three suspects are already in custody and are due to be charged imminently.

Under St. Lucia law, suspects can be held for 72 hours without charge unless an extension is granted by the magistrate.

'In this case we have enough evidence to get an extension before they are charged,' said Corporal Aniel Innocent of the Royal St Lucia police force.
