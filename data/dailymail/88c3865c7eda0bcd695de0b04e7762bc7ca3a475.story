They've been together for almost two years but Prince Harry and his girlfriend Cressida Bonas appeared reluctant to be pictured as a pair as they left the Ivy last night.

Joining them for dinner at the upmarket Covent Garden restaurant was Sam Branson, the son of Virgin tycoon Richard and Cressida's brother-in-law.

But it was glum faces all round as the trio made their way out of the restaurant, with Prince Harry appearing put out by the presence of the photographers outside.

Are you there? Prince Harry glances back at his girlfriend Cressida and her brother-in-law Sam Branson

Dressed in a blue zip-neck polo, jeans and a navy hat, the Prince had dressed down for the date, while Cressida was equally low key in an all-black ensemble.

It was a far cry from the sharp navy suit donned by the royal for a memorial service at Westminster Abbey for the late Nelson Mandela.

Hanging back: As usual, Cressida kept a low profile and refused to be photographed next to her royal beau

The ceremony, which included a 
tribute from South African prelate Desmond Tutu, also saw David Cameron 
take a break from the crisis in Ukraine to join Prince Harry and actor 
Iris Elba, who played the statesman in 2013 biopic, Mandela: Long Walk 
to Freedom.

Although 
Cressida didn't attend the memorial service, she has played an 
increasingly large role in the Prince's life since his return from the 
Antarctic at Christmas.

The dance graduate, 24, is now thought to be living at Kensington Palace with Harry and on Valentine's Day, was spotted picking up an M&S meal for two for the pair to enjoy.

And it's not the first time that she - and her royal beau - have opted to keep things low key.

Other recent dates have included trips to high street burger chain Byron and to see the Cirque du Soleil production of Quidam at the Royal Albert Hall.
