A care worker has appeared in court charged with attempted murder after staff and residents at a sheltered housing complex were taken ill with food poisoning-type symptoms. 

Melissa Swift was charged following the incident at Goldfield Court, West Bromwich, in which 16 people - including one in their 90s - suffered with nausea and diarrhoea. 

The 23-year-old, from West Bromwich, is also accused of making threats to kill in relation to the incident at the extra care unit for the elderly.

Ms Swift was arrested on August 4 after staff and residents reported suffering severe headaches, intense nausea and diarrhoea.

Four elderly residents were hospitalised. All have since made a full recovery. 

In a statement, Housing & Care 21, which runs the care home, told MailOnline: 'Housing & Care 21 puts the safety and wellbeing of our residents first in everything we do.

'We have been working closely with the police to assist them in their investigation.We have kept our staff and residents fully informed and will continue to support them as necessary.

'We are pleased to confirm that those affected have recovered and there have been no further reports of illness.' 

Goldfield Court is described as 'extra care housing' for older people. There are 93 flats at the site, run by Housing & Care 21.

The development includes lounges, a restaurant, a hair salon, a guest suite, an activity room and gardens for residents.

Flats can be rented rented or purchased under a shared ownership scheme and start at more than £33,000 for a quarter share and £107,000 for a 75 per cent share. 

In its most recent inspection of the sheltered housing complex, independent regulator the Care Quality Commission (CQC) found the site was meeting all standards.

A routine inspection carried out in October last year concluded the measures in place 'protected people who lived there from the risk of harm and abuse'.

The worker, who was suspended from her post after being arrested, appeared at Warley Magistrates' Court this morning.

She was remanded in custody and ordered to appear before Birmingham Crown Court on September 17.
