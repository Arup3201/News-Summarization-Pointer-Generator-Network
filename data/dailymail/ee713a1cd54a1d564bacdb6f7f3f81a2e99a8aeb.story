Sex offender: Michael Souter, 60, was convicted of 26 offences today at Norwich Crown Court

A former BBC presenter has been found guilty of 26 child sex offences spanning two decades and faces jail.

Michael Souter, 60, was found guilty of offences against seven boys aged 11-16, including indecent assault, indecency with a child and serious sexual offences.

The crimes took place between 1979 and 1999.

Police also confirmed today that they are investigating further claims against the presenter, who was said to use his status as a local celebrity to play on vulnerable boys.

A man who claims he was raped by Souter said he thought the former BBC and Radio Clyde present was 'the best thing since sliced bread' and that he 'aspired to be part of' his world before the alleged assault, which left him 'confused' and convinced 'he was the only one'.

The alleged victim - whose case has not been heard in court - said there was now 'little doubt' that there were other victims who have yet to come forward.

Souter, from Loddon, Norfolk, was found guilty of the 26 counts in a hearing at Norwich Crown Court. Jurors failed to reach a verdict on one count of indecent assault and cleared him of one charge of possessing an indecent photograph.

Prosecutors described Souter, who was also involved in the Scouts and a social services youth mentoring scheme, as a ‘sexual deviant’ obsessed with young boys in uniform.

During the five week trial, Andrew Shaw told jurors that Souter used his celebrity status to abuse society’s most vulnerable.

Mr Shaw told the court: ‘He worked in radio and television and was something of a local celebrity.

‘The significance of his work and his involvement with the scouts and social services, is that these three roles brought Mr Souter into regular contact with pliable young boys and very often pliable young boys who were among society’s most vulnerable.

‘We say Mr Souter is a deviant sexual abuser of young boys, particularly boys in uniform and those wearing shorts.’

On trial: Souter, pictured arriving at a previous hearing, said the allegations were part of a conspiracy

Souter, originally from Scotland, had denied the offences saying that he was the victim of a conspiracy in which allegations against him were made up.

He had worked as a producer and presenter in both commercial and BBC radio since the mid-1970s. He had previously presented for Radio Clyde.

Mr Shaw said mistakes may have been made by the authorities in the past, but added: ‘As we have seen in recent high profile cases, victims often only tell what has happened to them when they are ready to.’

The court heard that on one occasion Souter had plied an victim, a casual worker at BBC Norfolk, with alcohol.

He passed out and awoke to find his trousers pulled down and Souter, who had not been drinking, molesting him.

Another victim was indecently touched at a Scout camp, Mr Shaw said.

The court heard how he would take boys on trips to burger restaurants and theme parks, and used his links with Norwich City Football Club to invite them to matches.

After Souter was convicted, colleagues came forward to say they had long suspected him of inappropriate behaviour.

A man who worked for the BBC in the 1980s said: 'One of the first rules I was told when I started at the BBC was "never be in a room alone with Mike Souter"'.

'It didn’t come as any surprise to me when I heard he had been charged.'

Another man, who was not involved in the 
trial, told police in 2002 he had been raped by Souter two years earlier, at the age of 17.

He claimed the presenter, a friend of his parents, had invited him to his house and got him drunk before attacking him in bed.

The
man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said: 'I met Mike through 
my parents and he was a kind of mentor, helping me set up my own 
business.

'I thought he was the best thing since sliced bread - his was a world I aspired to be part of.

'When he raped me I was left confused and assumed I was the only one.

'Now I know there is a larger picture and there is little doubt that there are others in my situation.

'Mike Souter is somebody who values his reputation and public image above all else.

'Now this has been dragged through the public eye, he won’t be fooling anybody anymore.'

Detectives confirmed today that they are still investigating outstanding claims against Souter.

Norfolk police said they have identified 595 people as witnesses, a number of whom raised concerns about Souter’s behaviour.

A spokeswoman said: 'Anyone who may be affected by anything raised during this trial can contact police. Norfolk Constabulary is committed to working with partner agencies to prevent child sexual exploitation, support victims and bring offenders to justice.'
