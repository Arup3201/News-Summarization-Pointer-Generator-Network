You could say there was something of a cultural divide when the colourful Yank Rickie Fowler turned up wearing plus fours as a tribute to the late Payne Stewart.

All the Americans rushed to Twitter to proclaim his 'classy' gesture. The Brits? They took one look and thought: what a prat.

Simpson knows the score

When the US Open was held here in 1999, local man Webb Simpson was a scoreboard carrier with Tom Watson's group.

Now, after his opening 71, he is trying to win the event for the second time in three years to make Tom's Ryder Cup team. A neat twist of fate if ever there was one.

The maverick money-bag man

The richest man inside the ropes? That would be a caddie. Not a normal caddie, obviously. Scott McNealy, billionaire co-founder of Sun Microsystems, is caddying for his splendidly-named son Maverick. Scott must be thinking: who knew that not being paid was so much fun?

Henrik who?

It's not a great feeling as golf correspondent to look up at a leaderboard and find it topped by someone you've never heard of Henrik Norlander?

The Swede (below) dropped three shots late on but a 70 was still a fine performance for someone struggling on the Challenger Tour.

Open secret

Four weeks after denying our story that the Open is heading back to Portrush in Northern Ireland in 2019 for the first time since 1951, the Royal and Ancient will confirm it on Monday. How are we supposed to believe anything they say if they start pulling stunts such as this?
