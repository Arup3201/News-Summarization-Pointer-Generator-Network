Bill Gates sat for an interview Thursday in which he revealed his distaste for hacker-turned-whistleblower Edward Snowden.

The world's richest man may have gotten to where he is by sharing in the hacker's ethos of getting things done and making things better, but the 58-year-old told Rolling Stone that there's a right way and a wrong way to go about changing the world.

'I think he broke the law,' Gates said. 'So I certainly wouldn't characterize him as a hero.'

'You won't find any admiration from me': The world's richest man is not a big Edward Snowden fan, even if they've both set out to fix things in the world that they believe are broken

But that doesn't mean the man whose $76 billion worth dwarfs the GDP of many countries cares much for the U.S. government, either.

The conversation, printed in the latest issue of Rolling Stone, reveals he takes issue with both sides of the debate.

'If he wanted to raise the issues and stay in the country and engage in civil disobedience or something of that kind, or if he had been careful in terms of what he had released,' said Gates, 'then it would fit more of the model of "OK, I'm really trying to improve things."'

There has to be a debate. But the specific techniques they use become unavailable if they're discussed in detail. So the debate needs to be about the general notion of under what circumstances should they be allowed to do things.

In addition to being illegal, Gates suggests that the tactics used by Snowden--who dumped reems of files that incriminate the federal government for, among other things, its domestic spying program--don't really accomplish much good.

Instead, Snowden has put both the public and the government on the defensive.

'You
 won't find any admiration from me,' he said. 'There has to be a debate.

Gates says that Snowden, seen here via videoconference at the 2014 SXSW Festival, used tactics that inevitably left everyone on the defensive, improving nothing. But the billionaire says he's one of a group of 'highly qualified people' who have the right tools to fix the world's problems

But the same could be said for Gates' view of the federal government, which he calls one of the world's best while also pointing out it's weak spots.

'You have to have a certain realism that government is a pretty blunt instrument,' he said. 'And without the constant attention of highly qualified people with the right metrics, it will fall into not doing things very well.'

And who better to be one of those 'highly qualified people' than Gates' himself, whose Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation puts its $36 billion endowment toward improving civilization as a whole, from the bottom up.

The charity has task forces for wiping out polio and other disease, turning the tide of climate change, and ending world hunger among other admirable if lofty goals.

And in light of all that, the likes of Edward Snowden tucked away in Russia seems trivial.

'I see governments in very poor countries that can't even get teachers to show up. So in countries like that, how can you get very basic things to work? That's something I spend a lot of time on. And these things are all solvable,' he said.
