A married father, who died after he was stabbed in the neck and crashed his van as he tried to drive away, may have been the victim of a racist attack, police believe.

Detectives have begun a murder inquiry after an off-duty police officer found Mohammed Saleem Khan, 36, seriously injured in a rented white Ford Transit van in the village of Easingwold, near York, North Yorkshire.

He was taken to York District Hospital but died later.

A 26-year-old man from Easingwold was today arrested on suspicion of Mr Khan's murder.

Three other local people - a 20-year-old woman and two men aged 21 and 25 - have been arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender.

Mr Khan, a delivery driver, was found after his van crashed into two bollards on the village's main road, Long Street, at about 2.30am on Sunday.

It is understood that police initially treated the incident as a road traffic collision, but opened a murder inquiry after further analysis established that he had been stabbed.

Mr Khan was in the driver's seat when he was found by the off-duty police officer.

Detective Chief Inspector Heather Pearson, of North Yorkshire Police, said: 'This is a tragic incident for Mr Khan's family and specially trained officersÂ  are supporting them at this extremely difficult time.

'At this stage, there are a number of lines of enquiry that are being progressed.

'One aspect of the investigation is that this may have been an unprovoked, racially motivated attack.

'However, I am keeping an open mind about the motive.'

DCI Pearson thanked Easingwold 
residents for their 'tremendous support for their investigation, but 
urged anyone with information about Mr Khan's death to come forward.

'I would urge anyone who has 
information regarding the murder of Mr Khan or anyone who was in and 
around Long Street in Easingwold between 7pm on Saturday 22 September 
and 7am on Sunday 23 September 2012, to contact North Yorkshire Police 
or Crimestoppers as soon as possible.

'At this time a murder weapon has not
been found and I am appealing to members of the public in Easingwold to
report any discarded objects - be that weapons or clothing - to the 
police.

'I am also keen to establish the 
movements of Mr Khan. He was driving a white Europcar Ford Transit van 
and it is believed that he may have been in and around Easingwold for a 
period of hours prior to his murder.

'I am anxious to identify where he has been and who he has been with during 
this time frame.'

Mr Khan was originally from Luton but had recently moved to Birmingham, police said.

He
had been scheduled to make a drop-off in Easingwold at the week, but it
is unclear whether he had made the delivery before the attack.
