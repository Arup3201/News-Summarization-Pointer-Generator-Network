WOULD THEY LIE TO YOU? by Robert Hutton (Elliott & Thompson £9.99) 

Remember when politicians were taken seriously? I can, just about, and I still have most of my own hair and teeth.

For younger readers, though, honesty and integrity in politics are merely the stuff of legend.

We know they existed once, like smallpox, but they have long since been eradicated from the general population. It’s a sad state of affairs, but Hutton’s brief and brutally funny book shows how it has come about.

Hutton is Bloomberg’s UK political correspondent, and has been listening to politicians, their advisers, flunkeys and cheerleaders for longer than he cares to think about.

Only rarely, though, and probably by accident, has he heard the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.

His book is a guide (supposedly in its 14th edition) for government high-ups who need to learn how to dissemble, obfuscate, distract and confuse. Not that they would need such a guide. Being able to do those things seems to be the prime qualification for getting the job in the first place.

‘The world can be divided into people who make complicated ideas seem simple, and people who make simple ideas complicated. Whatever area you choose, from finance to academia to the church, you’ll find that glory, money and power flow more freely to the complicators than the simplifiers.’

We, too, can succeed through obscurity. ‘Not by lying. Lying is dangerous if you’re caught, and it’s quite unnecessary. You can steer a truck through the gap between the lie and a simple truth.’ Hutton’s book teaches us how to load that truck.

When asked about his relationship with Tony Blair, Gordon Brown famously stonewalled the interviewer

His ‘building blocks of uncommunication’ include the Statement of Fact, which is a truth placed before your audience not to impress in its own right, but to act as scaffolding for all the more important things you want left unsaid. In 2006, Gordon Brown was asked if he was happy with the way Blair was giving up power. ‘It’s a matter for him and the Labour Party,’ said Gordon. ‘It’s not really a matter for me at all.’

The interviewer pressed him further about his relationship with the great man. ‘We’ve been working with each other for more than 20 years,’ said Gordon. ‘I’ve been Chancellor while he’s been Prime Minister for nine years, and we continue to work together.’ Brilliant stonewalling, by any standards.

Politician-speak, in fact, has become so coded that it’s essentially another language — what you might call the language of uncommunication. Hutton has examples coming out of his ears. ‘I can’t promise that’ means ‘There is no way in hell that I’m ever going to do that’.

As Matthew Parris points out in a pithy introduction, the best satire tells us things we already knew

‘This is the right thing to do’ means ‘This is the thing we’re going to do’. ‘We need a grown-up debate’ means ‘I will only engage with people who agree with me’.

He is also full of good advice: ‘True success is the result of talent, good luck and hard work. Two of those you can’t count on, and the other one is a lot of effort. Much better to take credit for a success that has already happened, ideally one close to where you were standing.’

Is this too cynical? I think not. As Matthew Parris points out in a pithy introduction, the best satire tells us things we knew in our bones already. In this case, we also know many of them from Yes Minister and The Thick Of It, but they’re worth hearing again.

I particularly liked Hutton’s suggestions for the ‘rebranding’ of certain historical events. The Crusades become ‘Breaking Down Barriers Between Faith Groups’.

Henry VIII’s marital strategy was ‘Sustaining Families Through Wider Engagement’. And ‘Creating Critical Mass to Drive Demand for Safe Technology’? That’s Chernobyl.

If one or two of our politicians emerged from their bubble long enough to wonder why voters regard them with disdain, this book would be the perfect place to start.
