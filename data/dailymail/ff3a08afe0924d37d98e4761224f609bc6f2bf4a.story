Team news

West Ham

Sam Allardyce will be without at least two of his prized attacking options when the West Ham manager welcomes Tottenham to Upton Park for their Barclays Premier League opener on Saturday.

Andy Carroll (ankle) is a long-term absentee and summer signing Enner Valencia is short of fitness and will not feature against Spurs, while new recruit Diafra Sakho will be hoping to be involved despite only joining on Thursday.

Matt Jarvis (thigh) is definitely absent with Ravel Morrison (groin) and Carl Jenkinson (hamstring) also unlikely to be available to the Hammers boss.

Provisional squad: Adrian, Jaaskelainen, Cresswell, O'Brien, Reid, Tomkins, Collins, Demel, Jenkinson, Potts, Noble, Kouyate, Poyet, Diame, Nolan, Morrison, Whitehead, Downing, Vaz Te, Cole, Maiga, Sakho, Zarate.

Tottenham

Tottenham will assess Belgians Jan Vertonghen, Mousa Dembele and Nacer Chadli as well as Brazil midfielder Paulinho following their late return from World Cup duty ahead of the Premier League season opener at West Ham.

England winger Andros Townsend is expected to be involved after shaking off the ankle injury which ruled him out of the end of last term. Summer signings goalkeeper Michel Vorm and defenders Ben Davies and Eric Dier are fit.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

West Ham United won both clashes with Tottenham Hotspur last season in the Barclays Premier League.

Spurs have won just four of their last 16 opening weekend fixtures in the Premier League (D4 L8).

In fact, the Hammers beat Spurs three times in all competitions last seasons, winning the Capital One Cup quarter-final.

These two sides faced each other on the opening day of the 1999/2000 season. Harry Redknapp’s West Ham won 1-0 at Upton Park.

Treble top: West Ham defeated Tottenham three times last season, including a 2-0 win at Upton Park

This game will be Sam Allardyce’s 400th as a Premier League manager.

West Ham posted the worst shooting accuracy in the 2013-14 Premier League, hitting the target with just 37 per cent of their attempts on goal.

West Ham signing Enner Valencia scored three goals from five shots on target at the 2014 World Cup.

Tottenham won 10 Premier League away games in 2013-14, only one team (Arsenal, 11) had recorded more (four other teams won 10).

West Ham’s last three Premier League goals have come against London sides.

Tottenham scored only nine goals in 10 Premier League London derbies in 2013-14.
