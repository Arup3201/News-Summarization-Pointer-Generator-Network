A designer dog which became an online sensation and attracted thousands of followers after he was bought for £1,600 has been stolen by burglars.

Jamie Green, 29, bought Chow Chow puppy Misiu, which means little bear in Polish, as a surprise for his girlfriend five weeks ago.

He said he is 'heartbroken' and feels as though he has lost a child after thieves broke into his house in Stanmore, northwest London, on Wednesday.

'All I want is for Misiu to come home. It has been a horrible shock and I feel violated. If we get him back I won't press charges,' he told MailOnline.

'He's only three months old, he's a little baby. I feel like someone has stolen my child and I need time to grieve. 

'I'm worried that someone saw his picture or his profile online and targeted my house deliberately. I just hope he is being looked after. He is so precious to me.

'I'm scared to go outside but hate being here as someone broke in.' 

He became an online hit after Mr Green posted photographs of the dog on Imgur, where they were viewed almost 2.5million times.

On his Instagram page, which has 138 followers, Misiu is described as: 'A half bear, half dog model'

He bought the three-month-old puppy as a surprise present for his girlfriend of two years Joanna Gluminska

A photograph of Misiu on Buzzfeed attracted 80,000 likes and he has 1,110 likes on his Facebook page. 

Mr Green believes that the thieves were deliberately targeted designer breeds, which can have a high resale value, because they left behind his other dog, a Palmolein called Honey.

'I was coming back from working and I would normally hear him scratching at the door, but I didn't hear anything at all,' he said.

'I called his name, but when I went into the kitchen I saw the window was smashed and there was glass everywhere. It started to dawn on me that he might have been stolen.

'He was the only thing that was taken. They left money, an iPad a laptop and a £1,000 watch. I just hope whoever has taken him is looking after him properly.

'Misiu is such a distinctive dog and I have had so much attention [over] him. People love him. The fact not much was taken and my other dog was left is proof to me they targeted us for Misiu.'

On his Instagram page, which has 138 followers, Misiu is described as: 'A half bear, half dog model from London.'

Chow Chow dogs are originally from  northern China where they are referred to as Songshi Quan, which means 'puffy-lion dog'. 

Dog theft is increasing by about 15 per cent annually, according to charity Dog Lost.

Spokeswoman Nik Oakley told the Evening Standard: 'In London it is almost always designer dogs that are stolen -expensive pedigree animals that are worth a great deal of money.'
