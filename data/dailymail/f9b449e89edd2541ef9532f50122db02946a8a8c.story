A Florida family who decided to downsize after the financial crash have proved a little space can go a long way - even when raising two young children.

When Hari and Karl Berzins lost their home and restaurant business in 2008 they vowed never to use credit again - even when building their new house.

The couple used their limited savings to buy a plot of land in Virginia in 2011, and have built an adorable 168sq ft home to share with their children Archer and Ella, and a large dog.

Cosy: The family have made the most of the inside space and enjoy curling up on the sofa with a good book

With a galley kitchen, lounge-diner, bathroom and two loft bedrooms, the family have managed to squeeze their new lives into a tiny space.

'We decided to go this small because, after going through such financial stress, we decided to never use credit again,' Mrs Berzins told the Huffington Post.

'[We] built a home that we could afford to 
build to completion so that we could live comfortably in our space while
 we continued to build the rest of our homestead.'

It cost the couple $12,000 to make their tiny house, which was built on a flatbed trailer using materials found on Craigslist and from other sources.

The three-acre plot of land it is built on cost the couple $25,000, according to House Logic. And most of the construction was done by Mr Berzins.

'Karl learned his building skills from 
his father and his eight years working in construction during the 
building boom in Florida,' Mrs Berzins said. 'Itâ€™s genetic; he comes 
from a long line of Latvian handy-folk.'

Festive: The family made room for a Christmas tree during the holidays

The couple's quest to live a more affordable life has stretched beyond their tiny home. They have ducks and chickens and a large vegetable plot so they can grow as much of their own food as possible.

While the small house has given them peace of mind and a mortgage-free existence, the couple admit that with two children aged eight and ten, sometimes the space can feel a bit tight.

Room has to be found for bookbags, guitars, yoga mats and, in winter, extra coats and boots.

'We still have the stuff of everyday life, but there's a lot of shuffling about,' Mrs Berzins, who writes the Tiny House Family blog. said.

But when asked if they felt anything was missing, all Mr Berzins could think of was a tub - the family have only a shower in their bathroom.

By sacrificing space, the family have managed to make big savings and are well on their way to building a more regular-sized 1,400sq ft house on their plot of land.

The construction of the new home, and details about life in their tiny house, is chronicled on the family's Facebook page.
