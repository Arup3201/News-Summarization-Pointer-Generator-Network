A recent fight between Rosie O'Donnell and Whoopi Goldberg has producers at The View looking to add a cool-down room for the ladies.

After being cut off by Goldberg during an episode last week so the show could go to commercial, O'Donnell began to express how upset she was and, after being told repeatedly by Goldberg it was not the right time to have that discussion, eventually got cursed out by the Oscar winner.

Goldberg told O'Donnell, 'F*** it, I told you to leave it alone and you just don't want to listen. If you want to go there Rosie, I will dammit. I'm really sick of your s***!'

Temper tamper: Producers of The View may build a calm-down room for the ladies after Rosie O'Donnell and Whoopi Goldberg (above, with actor Neil Patrick Harris) came to blows in front oft he audience last week

Overblown: Goldberg told Thomas Roberts on his show Way Too Early this week that the ladies of The View (above) are like family, and sometimes gets 'cranky'

According to a source, 'At this point, you could've heard a pin drop. It was like everything came to a standstill and Rosie finally backed down.' 

Goldberg seemed to confirm what happened when she phoned in to Way Too Early this week and told host Thomas Roberts that the four women on the show are like family and 'like family, some days you're cranky.'

She then went on to call co-host Nicolle Wallace 'one of the smartest people I ever met' and praised Rosie Perez for being incredibly 'well read.'

She did not say anything about O'Donnell.

As for the cool-down room, producers think it will be a perfect way to avoid any negative press that could come of spats between the hosts or talent in front of the audience.

'Having a live audience can be sensory overload,' a source told the Daily News.

'Rosie needs an area to tap into her inner peace, and the rest of the cast can use it for a quick unwind during a commercial break, rather than let feelings boil over on set.'

Old friends: Prior to the show,. Goldberg and O'Donnell had been friends for years, seen here at the premiere of American idiot in 2010

The source also added that these rooms aren't that uncommon on shows.

'Talent are notoriously difficult,' they explained.

A rep for the show declined to comment.
