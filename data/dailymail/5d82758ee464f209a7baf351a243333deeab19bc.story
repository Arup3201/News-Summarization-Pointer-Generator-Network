It may seems like just another dance remake at first glance. But look a little closer and there are indications that set this particular remake apart from any other.

As the dancers jump, grind and thrust, the footage zooms into red scars that dissect their skin and large lumps on their bodies.

That’s because the women in the recreation of Eric Prydz’s ultra-sexy Call On Me video are all cancer patients.

The Norwegian patients and survivors prove that they’re not defined by their illness when they set out to re-enact one of the sexiest music videos ever.

The idea was conceived by Aktiv Against Cancer, an organisation that wants people to be active after they are diagnosed with cancer, and after their treatment.

Their aim was to demonstrate the positive effect of physical activity on the body and mind. And that no one should let cancer kill their confidence.  

The organisation believes that physical activity should be a part of cancer treatment.

The video ends on the shot of the group's 'dance instructor' walking towards the lone male dancer in the class. As she gets closer to him she takes off her long, blonde wig

Not what it looks like: At first glance, it seems to be just another video but close-ups show the scars of recovering patients

Getting sexy back: The video was made by Aktiv Against Cancer which believes activity helps aid recovery

Aktiv Against Cancer was founded by nine-times New York marathon champion Grete Waitz, who after her own diagnosis, joined forces with Helle Aanesen in November 2007 and started the organisation.

The group made the video not just to prove that cancer patients and survivors can still be sexy after a diagnosis but also to show that physical activity helps in recovery.

The dancers in this video were given training and and then flown to London, where they were taken to the same studio where the original video was shot.

One woman who took part in the video said: 'We believe in confidence. That's why we set out to remake one of the most daring music videos ever, starring cancer patients. 

'We did this to raise awareness. We did this to prove that cancer doesn’t have to kill your confidence.'
