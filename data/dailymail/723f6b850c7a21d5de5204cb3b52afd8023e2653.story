Victim: Estrella Carrera, 26, was found stabbed to death in her bathtub wearing her wedding dress

A newlywed still wearing her wedding dress was found stabbed to death in a bathtub at her suburban apartment just days after her wedding.

Estrella Carrera, 26, was found around 3:30pm on Sunday in the 7800 block of South Rutherford Avenue, in the Burbank area of Chicago, according to police.

Carrera's body was discovered after her sister became alarmed when she could not contact her and asked police to conduct a well-being check at the home, officials said.

When police called at her third-floor home, she was found with multiple stab wounds in an empty bathtub.

Relatives say she was a Spanish language translator for a welfare agency.

Police today declared the death a homicide after autopsy results confirmed she died from stab wounds.

The 26-year-old was last seen around 2am on Saturday, hours after her City Hall wedding the evening before.

She was due to pick up her two 
children - her nine-year-old daughter and two-year-old son- from a family member on 
Saturday afternoon but did not show up, according to the Chicago Tribune.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Clerk's office said that Estrella did not yet have a marriage certificate on file but had applied for a marriage license on May 2.

She just moved to the area about two months ago, neighbors told CW33, and is believed to have married a 30-year-old Chicago man who has not yet been identified.

Her cousin Sandy Lopez said he was the father of her youngest child and it was a quick wedding. They had been in an on-off relationship for three years.

She said Estrella called her on Friday to invite 
her to a party but didn't mention that it was a wedding party.

She told theÂ Chicago Tribune: 'She didn't tell anybody. She didn't want to tell me she had gotten married, but she sounded happy.'

She said she personally did not approve of the marriage or the 
relationship but was not speaking for the rest of her 
family.

'He's just a person who had problems,' she said. 'She was a beautiful mother, person, sister.'

Neighbor Jason Tokarczyk, 24, told the
paper she was quiet and generally kept to herself.

He said he 
frequently saw her with her son but was surprised to hear she had 
married.

'I've never 
seen her with a dude...I figured she was a single mom,' said Mr 
Tokarczyk. 'She was quiet as a mouse.

'I was shocked out of my mind to 
hear something had happened to her.'

Another neighbor said police were 
searching all around the area in dumpsters and garbage cans for a weapon
but came up with nothing.

Another local resident described the 26-year-old as 'pleasant' but said she was relatively unknown.

Burbank
police were releasing few details but said the death was being 
investigated by the South Suburban Major Crimes Task Force.

Police
are calling it an isolated incident stemming from a domestic situation,
but did not say whether anyone was in custody as of today.
