She is known for her skills in the saddle but today Zara Phillips showed off her prowess behind the wheel.

The Olympian equestrian, 31, was demonstrating a different kind of horse power as she drove a Range Rover in an off-road challenge.

She was then happy to get her hands dirty by helping out with a demonstration on how to change a tyre.

Leading by example: The Queen's granddaughter took part in the demonstration as she launched a Range Rover Evoque WISE Scholarship at the Royal Windsor Horse Show

The Queen's granddaughter was at the first day of the Royal Windsor Horse Show where she announced a new engineering scholarship programme. The Range Rover Evoque WISE Scholarship will provide a £9,000 bursary to three female students or apprentices who would like to explore a career or further studies in engineering.

In addition the winners will be provided with mentoring support from both Land Rover senior engineers and WISE representatives.

Game for a laugh: She smiled as she took on the unusual terrain

Zara, who is married to former rugby player Mike Tindle, spoke about how her grandmother and her mother, Princess Anne, where an inspiration to young women considering a career in engineering.

Before she was on the throne, the Queen joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) at her own insistence in 1945, 
aged 18.

Having enlisted as a Subaltern, the then princess progressed by the end
of the war to the rank of Junior Commander at the Mechanical Training Centre of the ATS.

As part of her training 
to become a fully qualified driver. The then Princess had to learn how 
to fix a car, including changing the wheel and basic engine maintenance.

Meanwhile, Princess Anne is the patron of WISE which
helps organisations to inspire women and girls to pursue careers in science, 
technology, engineering and mathematics.

Talking about the campaign today, Zara, who won a silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics in the equestrian team event, said: 'The UK has a rich heritage of women in engineering, encouraged by the 
success of the ATS.

Inspiration: The Queen joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) at her own insistence in 1945, aged 18

'I'm delighted to be supporting the Range Rover 
Evoque WISE Scholarship which provides young women with the opportunity 
to progress their career. In the Three Day Eventing world, I compete 
equally with men and enjoy the challenge.

'In fact, on the Olympic team 
there was actually only one man and we all made a great team. There are
equal opportunities for both men and women to succeed in engineering 
and now is an exciting time to get involved.'

Casual: Zara dressed down for the event in Windsor in jeans and a Land Rover jacket

Girl power: Zara hopes more women will take up a career in engineering like those she met today

Nicci Cook, Senior HR Manager, from 
Land Rover said: 'Land Rover has a proud tradition of encouraging 
diversity in the workplace. Engineering is at the very heart of our 
business and we rely on a broad range of talents to give us a 
competitive edge and help us move forwards. We hope that the Range Rover
Evoque WISE Scholarship will inspire a new generation of women in 
engineering.'

According to a report published by 
EngineeringUK, Britain needs to double the number of engineering 
graduates and triple the number of engineering apprentices by 2020 to 
meet industry needs. At present, just thirteen per cent of engineering 
undergraduates are female.

Friendly: The royal Olympian was happy to chat to fans

Happy: Zara looks like she had an enjoyable day

The Royal Windsor Horse Show is expecting to attract a record 4,095 competitors to the five day event, which is celebrating its 70th anniversary.

The show which is held in the private grounds of Windsor Castle features 174 classes including show jumping, driving and dressage.

Three of team GB’s Olympic gold medal winning showjumping team from London 2012 - Ben Maher MBE, Nick Skelton OBE and Peter Charles MBE - will also be appearing.

The Range Rover Evoque WISE Scholarship is open to any woman who has 
arranged an engineering based apprenticeship or has a confirmed place on
a higher education engineering course.
