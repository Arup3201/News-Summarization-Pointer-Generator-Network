At least 89 people have reported getting sick after eating Chobani Greek yogurt manufactured in Twin Falls, Idaho, the FDA has revealed - a week after the company announced a recall of containers.

Symptoms have been described by consumers as nausea and cramps, Food and Drug Administration spokeswoman told The Times-News yesterday.

No link has been confirmed between the illnesses and the yogurt. However, Ward says the FDA is working with Chobani to hasten its voluntary recall.

Chobani is pulling some of its Greek yogurt from supermarket shelves after hearing of 'swelling or bloating' in cups - 89 people have complained of being sick so far

Chobani last week told grocery stores to destroy 35 varieties of yogurt reported to have been contaminated by a mold associated with dairy products.

Chobani spokeswoman Amy Juaristi said last Thursday that 95 per cent of the tainted product had been destroyed.

The affected yogurt cups have the code 16-012 and expiration dates between Sept. 11 and Oct. 7.

Health officials have said the yogurt is not a public health threat, but the company said last week the 'mold can act as an opportunistic pathogen for those with compromised immune systems.'

Juaristi told the newspaper on Monday that they had identified the source of the issue at the Twin Falls plant and had taken steps to prevent it from happening again.

The company has not said what caused the outbreak or how it would prevent a reoccurrence.

The company said it has investigated and found a type of mold commonly found in dairy that may be to blame.

Chobani said the affected product came from its Idaho facility and represents less than 5 per cent of its total production.

The company has been working with retailers to remove and replace the contaminated containers.

Chobani, which is based in New Berlin, N.Y., did not say how many of its cups or what varieties were affected. The effort was voluntary and it is not issuing a formal recall.

A representative for Kroger, the nation's largest traditional supermarket operator, said Chobani issued a product withdrawal Friday. 'It was not a food safety issue,' Kroger spokesman Keith Dailey said in an email.

Last Tuesday, Chobani was responding to people who were complaining about their yogurt cups on Twitter. One person described her cup as 'unnervingly fizzy,' another said the cups were like 'yogurt soup' and another said it tasted like 'wine.'

Yet another person said the strawberry flavor they bought tasted 'really old.'

Chobani, which says it uses only high-quality, natural ingredients, has grown rapidly since it was founded in 2005.

Greek yogurt in general has surged in popularity as well, with fans saying they prefer its thicker consistency and relatively higher protein content when compared with the sweeter yogurt varieties that have long been sold in American supermarkets.

The private company had an estimated $244 million in revenue in 2010, according to S&P Capital IQ.

Chobani says customers with the affected code dates should contact its customer service team at care(at)chobani.com to get replacement products.Â
