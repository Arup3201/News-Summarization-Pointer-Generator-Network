Most people would rather tell a lie or do a bad deed if asked than face the social discomfort of saying no, according to a new study.

Researchers said we tend to underestimate the extent to which we can all 'influence someone else's ethical behaviour'.

People urged to tell lies or commit minor acts of vandalism were much more likely to do as asked than those who made the request anticipated, they found.

The research echoes Stanley Milgram's classic work, which found many more people than participants anticipated were willing to obey a scientist and administer a deadly electric shock. Milgram is pictured here, second from the right, in the 70s

The Canadian authors of the study, from the University of Waterloo in Ontario, said people may agree to do bad deeds to avoid the awkwardness of refusing.

Alternatively, people might choose to see such unethical acts as simply being helpful to others or a way to win popularity.

'Instigators failed to recognise the social pressure they levied on actors through simple unethical suggestions, that is, the discomfort actors would experience by making a decision that was inconsistent with the instigator's suggestion,' they wrote.

Lead author Dr Vanessa Bohns and colleagues carried out a series of experiments for the study, published in Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin.

First they asked 52 students to estimate how many people they would have to approach to find three willing to lie by signing a form saying the participant had given them a verbal introduction to a new course.

Participants guessed they would need to ask 8.47 people on average before three agreed but it turned out they only needed to ask around half as many - 4.39.

More than nine out of ten students overestimated how many people they'd need to ask.

In a second study 25 participants estimated how many people they'd need to ask before three agreed to vandalise a library book by writing the word 'pickle' inside in pen.

Participants thought they would have to ask nearly 11 people on average but in fact approaching just 4.7 people on average was sufficient.

Two further studies used hundreds of people recruited via Amazon's Mechanical Turk online survey website, asked to imagine they were either the 'actor', the 'instigator', or a neutral party in a range of hypothetical scenarios.

They included buying beer for underage children, illegally downloading a film and claiming expenses on personal dinners.

People playing the actor said they'd feel a lot more uncomfortable if a friend or colleague nudged them toward behaving unethically, compared with advising them to behave ethically.

But those playing the instigator or a neutral party did not anticipate this difference.

Researchers said this shows we underestimate people's willingness to comply with unethical requests because we fail to take their perspective.

The research echoes Stanley Milgram's classic work, which found many more people than participants anticipated were willing to obey a scientist and administer a deadly electric shock.
