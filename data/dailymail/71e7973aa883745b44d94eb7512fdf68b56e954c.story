Alan Pardew admits there are no more excuses after persuading owner Mike Ashley to invest £40million in his Newcastle squad this summer.

The United manager signed off from last season with supporters calling for him to be sacked after a horrendous run of 15 defeats in 21 from Christmas onwards.

That led to a frank discussion between Pardew and his billionaire boss and the upshot was nine new players, headed by £12m France playmaker Remy Cabella.

And, ahead of Sunday's opener at home to champions Manchester City, Pardew said: ‘It was fairly obvious that he (Ashley) listened to me at the back end of last year and the support I’ve had in terms of the new signings is exactly what was needed.

‘I’ve nothing to moan about now in terms of what’s happened this summer. We’ve got a strong squad, perhaps the biggest and best I’ve ever had in terms of options, so we’re in a great position.’

He went on: ‘When I signed the new (eight-year) contract, Mike always knew there would be ups and downs for both of us.

‘He stood by me and this feels like an up time for me. He’s armed me again.

‘One thing I can always give him is an honesty of where we are and he listens – that’s why so many players have entered the building, we needed them.

‘It’s that kind of relationship you can only hope for as a Premier League manager and I’m lucky enough to have it. I hope I can repay him this season.’

Pardew, then, is under pressure to deliver from the off and fans, disillusioned at the manner in which last season fell away, are also demanding an instant return.

‘I have to live with (the pressure) constantly because I live in the city, I’m surrounded by fans and they remind me constantly,’ he said.

‘I have to shield myself a little bit and almost put myself in a bubble, of trying to do the job to the best of my ability.’
