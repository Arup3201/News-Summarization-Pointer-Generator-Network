Arsenal's majority shareholder Stan Kroenke is happy with the club's fortunes under boss Arsene Wenger and believes he is the right man to lead them to future glory.

The Gunners have made an indifferent start to the season, currently in the Premier League table - nine points adrift from league leaders Chelsea.

However, the Emirates outfit ended a nine-year wait for silverware with their FA Cup victory last season and Kroenke is adamant Wenger will bring more silverware to the club.

Kroenke , speaking at Thursday's AGM, said he is proud of what the club have achieved under Wenger

Speaking the club's AGM on Thursday, the American said: 'We are proud of what we've accomplished.

'What a wonderful day that was at Wembley. One of the reasons we were interested in Arsenal was because of Arsene Wenger, and we look forward to much more success with him.'

Meanwhile, Wenger is wanted by former club Monaco despite only signing a new £24million contract in May. 

Officials from the Ligue 1 club, who Wenger managed from 1987 until 1994, met the Arsenal boss two months ago when they travelled to London to take part in the Emirates Cup.

Monaco had considered offering him a £10million-per-year tax-free deal, with his contract at Arsenal due to expire, but Wenger eventually signed a three-year extension with the Gunners.
