Made for TV: The move to use the Antiquities Act as a way to buy private property and turn it into national parks was a plotline in The West Wing

A Republican member of Congress slammed the Obama
administration Monday for creating five new national monuments when the US
federal government is struggling under the weight of a mandated austerity plan.

When the so-called budget sequester, a trigger mechanism
built into the failed 2012 congressional budget talks, kicked in, most federal
agencies were forced into across-the-board budget cuts. This includes the
Department of the Interior, whose National Park Service maintains and operates
national parks and monuments.

The Obama administration has cited the sequester-based austerity program in closing the White House to public tours, a move that Republicans have called needless and silly.

But the president created five new monuments Monday in a signing
ceremony announced just four days earlier. 'By designating these national
monuments today, we will ensure they will continue to inspire and be enjoyed by
generations of Americans to come,' he said.

The White House emphasized that the new designations 'were
made with bi-partisan support from congressional, state and local officials,
local businesses and other stakeholders and are expected to promote economic
growth.'

But Doc Hastings, a congressman from the state of Washington
who chairs the powerful House Natural Resources Committee, lashed out, countering that it was wrong to create new government expenditures
while the administration was already creating controversy with cuts to
constituent services.

Making moves: The President created the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument in Maryland, as one of five national monuments he created using the obscure law

'President Obama has closed the White House to public tours
but he's unilaterally ordering the National Park Service to spend scarce dollars
on little-known, privately owned property in Delaware,' Hastings said.

Vice President Biden will travel to that Delaware site on
Tuesday, along with Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar and Senator Tom
Carper. The newly designated First State National Monument is in New Castle,
Delaware.

Officials from the Department of the Interior insisted
Monday that the cost of operating five new national monuments would be small.

One official told MailOnline that compared to the
department's $12.2 billion overall budget, 'a couple million - probably tens of
millions - doesn't seem like much.'

Crying foul: Congressman Doc Hastings says that the decision will cost too much money and only help five states

Hastings also sniped that Obama was abusing the Antiquities
Act, a 1906 law intended to give presidents the power to save historically
significant sites from destruction.

The president, he said, was 'dictat[ing] under a century-old
law that the government spend money it doesn’t have on property it doesn’t even
own' and 'acting on simple whim.'

'No imminent threat of destruction or harm is posed at any
of these five locations,' he said.

'Especially troubling are the inclusion of private property
in these new monuments and the lack of transparency that surrounds monument
designations where the White House and President work in secret and are able to
thwart public review, public comment and consideration of environmental and
economic impacts.'

Hastings' concerns about the Antiquities Act drew parallels
to an episode of the popular TV drama The West Wing.

In an episode during the now-defunct show's eighth season, the fictional
Democratic President Jed Bartlet used the law to turn a contested piece of land
into a national park.

Taking cues? The move was the plotline of a former West Wing episode where fictional president Jed Bartlet (right) did the same thing

In the storyline, Republicans holding up a banking reform
law agreed to drop their objections if federal lands in Montana were opened to
commercial strip mining. Bartlet agreed, but double-crossed them by using the
Antiquities Act to put the land out of reach - after he signed the banking bill
into law.

In the real White House Principal White House Deputy Press
Secretary Josh Earnest fielded questions from reporters Monday, saying that
'these kinds of designations are important both for, in some cases, for the
local economy in these communities. ... you can see local economies growing up
around the designation of these properties that as visitors come to enjoy these
new national monuments that will have a stimulative impact on the local
economies.'

Earnest also said that 'a lot of the land for these new
national monuments was either land that was already owned by the federal
government or it was donated. And in terms of the immediate costs in terms of
the management of the land, I think they’re pretty minimal in the early
stages.. '

'But certainly future budgets that the administration will
offer will reflect the acquisition of these new properties.'

The Conservation Fund, a private organization, donated land
to create parts of two of the national monuments Obama created Monday, in
Delaware and Maryland. The other three sites are in Ohio, New Mexico and the
state of Washington.
