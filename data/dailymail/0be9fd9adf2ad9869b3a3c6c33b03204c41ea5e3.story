They may be more accustomed to patrolling the beat, but one police force has shown that it doesn’t have the X Factor when it comes to trying to sing along in time to it.

Facebook users have slammed Bedfordshire Police’s ‘tragic’ cover version of Slade’s 1973 anthem Merry Christmas Everybody – the not very catchily named ‘Christmas Crime Reduction’.

The force had hoped that the song would offer residents winter crime advice but it is unlikely to trouble the frontrunners for the number one spot over the festive period.

Although it didn't cost the Beds Police anything to produce, some residents have taken to Facebook and Twitter to question whether putting the song together was an appropriate use of employees time.

Rip off: Bedfordshire Police has attempted to spread its seasonal crime prevention message by re-writing festive anthem Merry Christmas Everybody by Slade, pictured performing in 1973

Communications staff at the force came up with the novel idea as part of its focus on driving down burglary.

Instead of using the song's traditional lyrics, the team penned a version of their own.

Their version of the song includes such lines as: ‘It’s a time when every burglar has a ball, have you locked the upstairs window?

'Are the keys left by the door? Have you turned the lights on so that they’re not sure?’

In place of the famous refrain 'What would you do if you saw your mother kissing Santa Claus?' is a cringeworthy plug for the force's crime prevention website.

And instead of Noddy Holder's rasping vocals, police project analyst Jacqueline Cooper took to the microphone.

And not everyone was impressed with Beds Police's songwriting skills.

It's a no from me: Facebook user Sean McNally did his best Simon Cowell impression to pan the Beds Police Christmas crime reduction song

Unimpressed: Although Facebook user Adam Croft thought that the idea was good, he said the lack of money used for producing the song showed

Not a fan: Max Ogden questioned how much time the police force had spent on the song

Thumbs up: Not everyone disliked the Christmas tune. Emma Carter complimented Beds Police on their festive song

Sean McNally took to the force Facebook page to say: ‘Well all I'm gonna say is Simon Cowell would not be impressed at all.’ (sic)

Paul Keating described the version as: 'Tragic'.

Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?It's the time when every burglar has a ball,Have you locked the upstairs window?The key is by the door,Have you turned a light on so that they aren't sure?So here it is crime reduction,It's advice that you can use,Put off those burglars,Make sure they're the ones to loseHave you locked all the doors before you leave?Don't leave your presents on display for them to thieveHave you seen anything suspiciousThat you maybe should report?Get on the phone to us so they'll get caughtSo here it is crime reduction,It's advice that you can use,Put off those burglars,Make sure they're the ones to loseVisit our website for tips and advice and sign up to RingmasterAaaahaaaaaHave you marked up all your stuff with your postcode?Have you registered it on the Mobilise in case it goes?For a New Year's resolutionGo to a property marking eventThere'll be one near you to bring the gifts that you've been sentSo here it is crime reduction,It's advice that you can use,Put off those burglars,Make sure they're the ones to lose

Benjamin Ferdinand took to Twitter to claim that Beds Police had 'ruined Christmas, while Adam Croft added: 'I just died a little inside.'

Max Ogden questioned how many hours of police staff time were used to produce the song.

But the Christmas spirit wasn't lost on everyone.

Emma Carter tweeted: 'Good song. Gets the message clearly across.'

Andrea Briggs, E-Comms Manager at Bedfordshire Police said: 'The idea came around last year as we looked to promote crime prevention advice during the Christmas period.

'It is a bit of fun but the message behind it is very clear.

'We want people to have a very Merry Christmas without becoming the victims of crime. .

'The song isn’t available to buy as we want as many people as possible to hear it free of charge.'

The song didn't cost the force as the recording session was donated for free.

Bedfordshire Police isn't the only emergency service to find novelty ways of reducing crime and promoting community safety this winter.

The county's fire service also decided to show off its lyrical skills by producing its own version of Rocking Around the Christmas Tree.

The catchy tune's reworked words go: 'Rocking around the Christmas tree, don’t make the fire bells ring out!

'Test your smoke alarm every week, don’t take the batteries out.'

Surrey Police were slated earlier this month for tweeting lyrics warning motorists that roads were slippy in the style of Vanilla Ice's 1990 hit 'Ice, Ice Baby'.

Meanwhile, creative Canadian cops in Abbotsford, British Columbia, sent out a Christmas card to well know criminals asking whether they would be on Father Christmas's naughty or nice list next year.

The card featured the local police chief dressed up as Santa and clutching an automatic weapon.
