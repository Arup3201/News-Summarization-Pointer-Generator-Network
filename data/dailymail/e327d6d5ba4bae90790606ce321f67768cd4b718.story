As obesity rates soar across the UK, one health store think they have the answer to our weightloss woes.

Superdrug is launching the first set of scales which replace the dreaded stones and kilos with celebrity comparisons, in a bid to alleviate Brits of their weighty worries.

The calibrated scales highlight celebrities who fall between eight and 18 stone, and feature celebrities 
including Rihanna, Cheryl Cole, Khloe Kardashian, Gemma Collins and the Duchess of 
Cambridge.

Due to be tested in stores this week, Superdrug say the aim of the scales is to help bring down the barriers that stop people talking about and managing their weight effectively.

A whole new weight game: Forget pounds, stones and kilos, you can now weight yourself in comparison to celebrities

Stepping 
onto them allows users to gauge their weight relative to that of several celebrities, 
so instead of weighing 9st 2lb, they're able to claim they 
weigh between a Beyonce and a Rihanna.

Cheryl Cole, at 8st is the celebrity at the lightest end of the scales, Khloe Kardashian occupies the mid range at 12st 11lb and Queen Latifa - 14st - and Melissa McCarthy - estimated at 18st - are at the higher end.

Do you weigh Beyonce? Now you can emulate your favourite A-listers via these scales

Weighing in: Weigh 9st 6lb? No you don't, you weigh between Beyonce and Rihanna, according to Superdrugs' new scales

The scales were produced in response 
to new research which reveals that losing weight is an ongoing concern 
for over 60 per cent of the UK population, with 40 per cent admitting to
 avoiding bathroom scales altogether for fear of seeing the 
result.

Cheryl Cole - 8st

Kate Middleton - 8st 6lb

Jessica Ennis - 8st 9lb

Ellie Goulding - 9st

Beyonce - 9st 4lb

Rihanna - 9st 7lb

Christina Hendricks - 11st

Khloe Kardashian - 12st 1lb

Adele - 14st

Queen Latifa - 14st

Gemma Collins - 16st

Melissa McCarthy - estimate 18st

Additionally, almost one in three (29 per cent) of us admit being unhappy with our current weight at any given time.  

The findings also revealed that thinking about weight is a daily preoccupation for over a quarter 
of the UK (26 per cent). 

It's women who think most about it, with 16 per cent claiming 
to think about their weight more than three times every day, compared to
 just four per cent of men. 

The research also reveals the 
lengths to which people would go to not reveal their true weight.

Some 40 per cent 
will not discuss their weight with family or friends, and 12 per cent of us admit
 to not even divulging our truthful weight to healthcare professionals.

And when pushed to state what they weigh, 60 per cent of Brits will claim to be 
at least half a stone lighter than they actually are.

In
 fact, so reticent are Brits to talk about their weight that they prefer to tell others how much alcohol they drink (48 per cent), their salary 
(18 per cent) the debt they're in (10 per cent), the number of sexual partners they've 
had (10 per cent) or their pin number (two per cent).

A spokesperson for Superdrug said: 'Our new scales are just one of the ways that the health team here are helping our customers to be more open about discussing their health needs with our in store healthcare professionals. 

'We're pleased to be piloting these scales amongst our store teams and, if successful, would look at potentially rolling them out for customer use nationwide.'

A spokesman for eating disorder charity BEAT told MailOnline: 'This type of exploitation of the most toxic aspect of celebrity culture is just wrong in so many ways.

'Of course many people are concerned about maintaining a healthy weight, but inviting a spurious comparison with another person’s supposed weight doesn't help anyone.'

Bristol (23 per cent happy)Cardiff (19 per cent happy)London (17 per cent happy)Bradford (16 per cent happy)Coventry (15 per cent happy)

Liverpool (20 per cent unhappy)Leeds (18 per cent unhappy)Nottingham (16 per cent unhappy)Glasgow (16 per cent unhappy)Manchester (15 per cent unhappy)

A-list weights: The scales will show you as a Jessica Ennis if you weight around 8st 9lb and 14st women are an Adele

Lorna Driver-Davies nutricentre.com nutritionist said:'I am very concerned with the concept of celebrity weighing scales. As a nutritionist I have no objection to women weighing themselves in kg - this is commonplace on normal scales and many women choose the metric method of weight – for example in France and Germany. 

'Comparing your weight to anyone - your friends, sister or colleagues would be a very unhealthy way to judge your own weight – so a comparison to celebrities is even worse.

'These scales do not take into account body fat percentage, height, BMI, waist and hip measurements and common sense on what is a healthy weight for an individual.

'Not only is this concept deeply unscientific but also I believe it would encourage even more insecurity and anxiety about weight which is a sad situation.

'These scales also set a very poor example to teenage girls who are often more susceptible to eating disorders and are easily impressed by celebrity status.'
