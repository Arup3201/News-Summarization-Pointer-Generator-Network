Archaeologists have discovered an ancient Mayan mural that could contain one of the earliest examples of 'photobombing'.

The painting, which dates to around 600-900AD, was found during excavations of ruins in the Mayan city of Xultun in the rainforests of Peten in north-west Guatemala.

Using digital scanning techniques to enhance the fading paint on the interior walls of a half buried building in Xultan, scientists found it featured a ruler of the city seated on a throne in front of kneeling attendants and scribes.

However, behind the seated ruler - who is dressed lavishly in a huge headdress - is another figure, seen poking their head out from behind their lord.

The figure of an attendant peeking out from behind the throne of the ruler in this recreation of a 1,250 year old mural discovered in the Mayan city of Xultan could be the earliest example of a photobomb discovered

Researchers at Boston University and Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York, who excavated the discovery said it was extremely rare to find figures standing behind a ruler in this way in Mayan art.

The person is thought to be a courtly attendant who may actually be helping to dress the ruler.

Speaking to Livescience, Dr William Saturno, an archaeologist at Boston University who led the research, said: 'It's like a photobomb. He's almost like - "do you see me here?"'

A huge Maya dam uncovered by archaeologists is thought to have provided filtered drinking water to the great Mayan city of Tikal.

The dam found at the site of Tikal in northern Guatemala, stretched more than 260 feet and stood 33 feet high. 

It is thought to have held about 20 million gallons of water in a man-made reservoir.

The discovery in 2012 shed light on the lifestyles of the ancient Maya water and land-use systems at Tikal, located in northern Guatemala.

It shows how the Maya conserved and used their natural resources to support a highly complex society for over 1,500 years despite environmental challenges, including periodic drought.

Tikal is thought to have been inhabited by between 60,000 to 80,000 people.

Researchers believe that the mural could also be depicting a meeting of a guild or organisation of mastercraftsman or scribes as they take part in a ceremony with their king.

Dr Heather Hurst, an archaeological artist at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York and an honorary research associate at the University College London, who reconstructed the paintings, said: 'This is not a formal portrait of the king at all as if it had been he would have been depicted alone.

'This is about courtly life and how it worked.'

She said that the peeking figure may even have been put there to add a little humour to the image.

'I wouldn't put it past them at all,' she said. 'However there are similar murals from around the same time that also depict servants helping a prince getting dressed.'

The murals were first discovered in 2010 by an undergraduate student called Maxwell Chamberlain while he was inspecting a hole made by looters.

He noticed faint traces of paint on an exposed area of interior wall and as the archaeologists examined it they found it was far more extensive.

After careful excavation they discovered the painting extended around three walls of the 63 square foot room (5.94 square metres).

Dr Hurst said that they believe the room may have been the work space or studio for a group of artists working for the king.

They also discovered the skeleton of a man buried beneath the behind the murals - possibly one of the scribes depicted in the 1,250-year-old mural.

Dr Hurst said: 'A lot of effort and passion has been put into the painting. I have illustrated and excavated a lot of artworks but I have never seen such a carefully painted mural.

'The calligraphy alone is stunning.' 

The mural, which has been painted on the mud-based plaster that covered the walls, shows 11 figures on the west, north and east walls.

Sadly any paintings that had been on the south wall had been obliterated by the looters when they broke into the building.

Using digital scanning the scientists were able to map the mural and enhance the painting, allowing it to be studied in detail for the first time.

The figure poking out from behind the throne being examined by a researcher on the right of the picture above, is not immediately obvious but scientist spotted it with digital scanning techniques to study the mural

Red, orange blue and black pigments used to produce the vibrant mural (shown above) have faded over time

Dr Hurst said the room would have been covered in vibrant red, blue, green and black colours. 

While some of these pigments were local to the Xultun region, others like the bright blue and green used to paint the ruler were probably imported, said the researchers.

She said that the portrait of the ruler may also have been covered with some sort of curtain most of the time.

She said: 'We found holes in the wall around that suggests that part of the wall may well have been covered for much of the time.

'This would have put the attention clearly on the scribes. What is interesting is that the doorway that would have been on the south wall was slightly offset to the left.

'This would have framed the whole mural and shows the spotlight was not just on the ruling figure.' 

According to the researchers, the architecture of the building where the murals were found suggests the focal point of the artwork was the central portion on the north wall, where the figure sitting on a throne is depicted and the scribe is kneeling before him.

Three seated figures on the west, thought to be taaj, or obsidians who are members of a ritual order, face north towards the central scene.

Similarly the figures on the poorly preserved east wall also appear to be facing towards the scene on the north wall.

The building was found during excavations of mounds that cover old residences in the rain forest of Peten

Kneeling in front of the figure on the throne is a figure labelled 'itz'in taaj', which means junior obsidian and is gesturing with his left hand.

The seated lord wears a large, blue green feathered headdress and holds a staff in his right hand, etched with wind symbols, and a incense bag in his left.

Maya kings were known to often dress up as deities in re-enactments of events from the mythic past. The figure peeking out behind him, labelled as individual eight by the researchers, is thought to be helping hold up the headdress.

Writing in the journal Antiquity, Dr Saturno and his colleagues said: 'It is very likely that the Xultun mural is in fact a group portrait made by the scribal-priests themselves.

'The mural establishes a direct relationship between a particular order, or guild, of Xultun artists and scribal-priests and their lord, and it celebrates its members’ achievement in consulting and producing work for their sovereign’s reign.

The faint outline of figures on the west wall of the building can also be seen in the image above

'Additional texts accompanying the scene affirm that the portrayed rule is indeed impersonating a wind deity.

'Individual eight leans out from behind the ruler's headdress, perhaps in the process of dressing the seated lord.

'He is labelled as baah tz'am, a title carried by particular courtly attendants.

'It is rare to find the title explicitly paired with an attendant behind a ruler's throne - more commonly these figures remain unnamed in court scenes.'

The researchers claim that the mural is particularly valuable as it is one of only two found in the eastern Maya lowlands.

Dr Hurst said: 'Murals like this are rare due to the humid climate in the tropics - they just are not preserved that well, especially one of this antiquity.

'It really is an outstanding discovery. But perhaps more exciting is the context - it is in an ordinary residence rather than a temple or court.

'Adjacent to this room there have been living spaces, areas for cooking and pantries found, but it looks like this room had a specific purpose.'
