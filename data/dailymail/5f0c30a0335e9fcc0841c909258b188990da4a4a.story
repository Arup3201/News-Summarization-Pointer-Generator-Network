Shocking video footage has emerged of the extraordinary moment a Brazilian minibus was swallowed up in the middle of the road and then swept away in a furious torrent of flood water.

Filmed in a remote area of Para state in the north of the country, the clip begins by showing the silver bus being evacuated after becoming stuck on a rapidly collapsing road.

Seconds later a massive sinkhole opens up beneath the vehicle causing up it to plummet into the fast-moving flood waters below. The stricken bus is then seen being carried off into the distance by the raging deluge.  

Calm: Filmed in a remote area of Para state in the north of the country, the clip begins by showing the silver bus being evacuated after becoming stuck on a rapidly collapsing road

Good decision: Having spotted the road surface rapidly disintegrating, the driver of the bus decided to evacuate and abandon the vehicle before it is too late

Sinking: Seconds later that decision is vindicated as a massive sinkhole opens up directly beneath the bus, causing it to tumble into the raging deluge below

The shocking video shows the bus grinding to a halt as it travels along the Amazonian mud track.

With a flooded river running beneath the road, it becomes clear to the driver that the surface is rapidly disintegrating, so he decides to abandon the vehicle before it is too late.

Seconds later that decision is vindicated as a massive sinkhole opens up directly beneath the bus, causing it to tumble into the furious waters below.

The sheer power of the flooded river is immediately evident as the massive vehicle is washed away by the current, bucking and bronking in the water, which has taken on a yellow colour due to the amount of mud and silt it has washed away from the surrounding area.

Thankfully nobody was injured in the incident, which is believed to have been filmed after recent heavy rainfall in remote areas of Para state.

No resistance: The stricken bus is seen being carried off into the distance by the rampaging flood waters

The incident comes just a week after more than 50 people died after a tour bus plunged off a ridge into a wooded ravine in the mountains of southern Brazil.

The bus fell 1,300ft after swerving off a bend in Santa Catarina state as night fell, with at least 11 children among the dead.

Highway and weather conditions at the time of the accident in Santa Catarina were good as the bus made its way from the neighbouring state of Parana, a police spokesman said.

Although no immediate cause for the crash had been determined, police said it appeared the brakes on the bus had failed.

Around 43,000 Brazilians are killed in car crashes every year, with the accident rate increasing 24 per cent from 2002-2012.
