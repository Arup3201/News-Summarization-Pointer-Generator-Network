The morning after a dismal Champions League defeat to Legia Warsaw, Ronny Deila woke early from a fitful sleep.

‘Deila M for Murder’ was the headline in one national newspaper. It reflected the Norwegian’s mood perfectly.

There was no blood on the walls. No one had died. Yet Celtic’s manager felt as if he had woken from a nightmare of Hitchcock proportions.

Lifeline: Ronny Deila is determined to take advantage of Celtic's Champions League lifeline

‘I felt as if I’d killed someone when I woke up,’ he told Sportsmail yesterday. ‘That’s how it is every time I lose a match.

‘If you don’t hurt when you lose matches, something’s wrong. That’s the worst feeling in football, waking up the morning after a defeat.’

Celtic had lost more than their reputation as an established Champions League club in the course of a 6-1 aggregate defeat to the Polish champions. They had also lost a vital source of revenue.

Celtic’s plc board don’t budget for reaching UEFA’s group stages. They would have coped with going out. But the huge, unexpected stroke of luck offered by a Legia Warsaw registration error has resurrected the prospect of a £15million windfall for the Parkhead club. For Deila, it’s the difference between finally signing a player of pedigree or bringing in more jersey fillers.

In the aftermath of the Murrayfield debacle — that second-leg 2-0 defeat — he spoke of rebuilding his team from scratch.

He has since backtracked, realising perhaps that he doesn’t have that luxury. Instead he has to get the best from what he has. Telling the existing squad they were finished was the mistake of a man running on empty.

A new coach at a new club, in a new city, in a new country, Deila felt exhausted and probably a little overwhelmed post-Legia. There was an admission yesterday that he may not have been fully on top of his brief.

Preparation: The squad are in Slovenia preparing for the first leg of their play-off against Maribor

‘It was a very difficult position to be in,’ he said. ‘I had only been at the club for four weeks and we had been pushed into it. But you learn quick in this job. I also felt tired after the game because I think I had maybe pushed myself too much.

‘The first day was very hard but you have to admit what level you are at. On that day, we were at that level and had to work from there.

‘I feel very different right now. I had done a lot of work and a lot of travelling, and I didn’t know many people. Now I know my team, I have got my head up and I have control of the situation.’

The first he heard of what proved to be an incredible Champions League lifeline was when a journalist called him later that night.

Legia tried everything to overturn UEFA’s decision to award Celtic a 3-0 second-leg win after Bartosz Bereszynski played the final minutes of that match while suspended.

It was a genuine mistake, but a hugely costly one. It was also an enormously fortuitous break for Celtic. One Deila feels duty bound now to take advantage of against Maribor on Wednesday.

Discussion: Deila in talks with assistant John Collins about their plan of action

‘I didn’t feel anything when I was told we could be back in,’ Deila said. ‘My focus is always on football. It’s about performances, whether you get the chance or not. When we perform, we achieve things. We have got a second chance and we will do everything to take it.

‘I know now where we are going and I know how we are going to improve. Now we have a chance to see how far we have improved in 14 days. I am confident that we are going to reach the right level as we showed on Saturday.

‘I think we are in a good mood in the group. They are training good and have responded fantastically. Everyone is doing everything they can to improve every day.’

Against Legia, of course, the real damage was done away from home in Warsaw with a dire 4-1 loss.

‘Yes, I made mistakes in Warsaw,’ admitted the Norwegian. ‘What were they? We’ll see.’

It’s unlikely, this time, he will be as tactically gung-ho. Square pegs occupied round holes in the Pepsi Arena that night and the Celtic coach is less likely to make the same selection errors this time.

‘The first time we went into the Champions League I hadn’t been long with the players,’ he conceded. ‘I feel more comfortable with them now — I know what kind of team I have. I know the strengths of the players now.

‘Also they are looking in good shape. They are fitter than in the last match and have adapted more.

‘So that puts us in a better position than we had the last time.’

All smiles: Striker Anthony Stokes in high spirits in training ahead of the game

The Warsaw result might have been an acceptable narrow defeat but for a late collapse. From 2-1 with six minutes remaining, it finished 4-1, rendering the second leg a hopeless act of futility against a better team.

Champions of Slovenia for the last four years, it is likely Maribor will look at the videos of Legia and fancy their chances. Understandably. In recent years, they have toppled Rangers and Hibs and have individuals with technical ability.

But Deila’s aim is to fly back to Glasgow with the tie still alive. With a fighting chance.

‘You have to think long term of course,’ he admitted. ‘But now, in the short term, everything is about a result. I’m much better now than I was and I think the players have adapted.’

For all the positive signs against Dundee United at the weekend, there are dangers in reading too much into domestic football. Recent European results show that the SPFL lacks the financial clout to compete at this level.

Celtic have managed to add players — and Craig Gordon, Jason Denayer and Jo Inge Berget show signs of adapting quickly. But Aleksandar Tonev didn’t travel here, while Ghanaian Wakaso Mubarak was last night scrambling to clear up the red tape which would allow him to feature.

It is also the case that injuries to James Forrest and Adam Matthews are a nuisance Deila could do without.

Buoyed by that 6-1 thrashing of United, however, he insisted: ‘They showed they are at a better level than they were away to Legia. Small things can make a big difference and I think those small things are going more in our favour now than they were in Warsaw.

‘We are more prepared and I have a good feeling that we can make a good performance and get a result to take home to Glasgow.’
