Pupils at a Scottish school were left 'gagging in the corridors' after a sewage pipe burst inside the building and effluent spilled down the walls.

Children stayed at home in droves because of the smell at Carnoustie High School in Angus while contractors battled to stop the flow of waste.

One concerned parent branded the school a 'health hazard', while another, Michelle Penman, said her children had told her the smell was 'horrific'.

Waste: Children were left feeling ill because of the smell of raw sewage at Carnoustie High School in Angus

Morning lessons and school dinner arrangements were disrupted as the sewage ran down the walls, through lockers and out of plug sockets.

One parent, who asked not to be named, said children were left 'retching' during the episode.

She said: 'A sewage pipe had burst and it was running down the walls in the kids' social area, and down behind the lockers where they keep their belongings and lunch.

'The Headmaster wasn't saying whether the school was shutting, all that he said for pupils to do was to take their lunch hour as normal, from one to two, and come back.

'They've also been told not to use the toilets in the meantime and so they've had to go home to do that. It's a health hazard.'

Big stink: Lessons were disrupted as the sewage ran along floors, down walls and through light sockets

One witness said that cleaners were working 'with masks and mops' on one side of doors while 'unmasked support staff on the other side of the door' were moving pupils along.

They described the stink as 'outrageous'.

Michelle Penman and Jacqueline Patterson were other concerned parents.

Michelle said: 'My two have said the smell is horrific.

'How can they expect them to do lessons smelling raw sewage?'

And Jacqueline, who said the children should have been sent home immediately, described a horrific scene of effluent 'running through light sockets' and school lockers being surrounded by 'puddles of sewerage'.

Morning lessons and school dinner arrangements were disrupted in the incident at the Carnoustie school

Some parents have voiced frustration at children being asked to return after lunch - despite pupils complaining that the smell was making them feel sick.

Head teacher Fraser Booth had advised pupils to take their lunch break as normal during the incident on Thursday.

But parents were contacted later by email and text and advised the school would open as normal today after a 'deep clean'.

A council spokeswoman said: 'There has been a problem with a leakage of raw sewage.

'The affected areas, which are not classrooms, have been sealed off while we work with Robertsons, who are responsible for the maintenance of the building, to resolve the issue.'

The local authority later tweeted that following a clean-up overnight, the school would be open today.
