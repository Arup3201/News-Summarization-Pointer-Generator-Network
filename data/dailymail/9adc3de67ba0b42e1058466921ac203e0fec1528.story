Wanted man: Philip Egglishaw is alleged to have 'absconded with or spent all' of Crocodile Dundee star Paul Hogan's money

A British tax adviser accused by Crocodile Dundee star Paul Hogan of stealing £22 million of his earnings is hiding out in Switzerland – directly above a police station.

Philip Egglishaw, 59, who allegedly helped conceal the movie star’s earnings in offshore tax havens,  is said to have ‘absconded with  or spent all’ of the money and is a wanted man in Australia.

Australian authorities – who have been told by The Mail on Sunday of Egglishaw’s whereabouts – are hunting him in connection with a massive tax evasion scheme used by wealthy people there.

Egglishaw is understood to have helped 73-year-old Hogan move the money through his Geneva firm, Strachans, so he did not have to pay tax on it in Australia. Egglishaw has issued a statement denying accusations that he had stolen the money.

When The Mail on Sunday tracked him down to his home in a quiet five-storey block in an upmarket area  of Geneva he refused to discuss the allegations against him. Neighbours said they saw the well-spoken Briton only when he walked his dog.

Hogan became a star after the success of Crocodile Dundee in 1986. He married his co-star, Linda Kozlowski.

The Australian actor has filed legal papers against Egglishaw in the US. Egglishaw has ‘absconded with or spent all’ of the star’s millions, according to documents filed in the Californian District Court.

Hogan’s representative provided the court with an email sent last October to Egglishaw’s lawyer in Geneva, Paul Gully-Hart, claiming Egglishaw was engaging in criminal fraud. The email said the ‘actions of Egglishaw have now crossed the boundary of legality and he is now engaging in criminal fraud, theft and breach of fiduciary duty, and you are now directly aiding and abetting his criminal actions’.

Writ: Paul Hogan as Crocodile Dundee with co-star Linda Kozlowski

This newspaper also visited  Mr Gully-Hart’s office in central Geneva on Friday, but he refused to come downstairs to the reception.

Instead he sent an email referring to an earlier statement released on behalf of his client.

The statement said: ‘It is a matter of public record that I have acted for various Australian clients.

‘My firm is regulated, externally audited and operates openly in  Switzerland. The accusations made in the media that I or my firm have stolen or inappropriately dealt with client funds are completely false and vehemently denied.

‘We are strictly following advice received from our Australian QCs  to achieve an outcome satisfactory to our clients and the Australian authorities to allow repatriation of funds to Australia ensuring that all due taxes are met.’

Egglishaw has operated from  Switzerland since the Nineties.

But in 2003 Australian tax inspectors found evidence that his ‘tax efficient’ schemes breached the law, after searching his five-star hotel room in Sydney. When Egglishaw’s laptop was seized, it revealed names of numerous wealthy clients. But by then he had fled to Switzerland.

Operation Wickenby, a joint investigation by the Australian Crime Commission and the Australian Tax Office, discovered that Strachans was setting up fake companies for high-earners, who sent money off shore with fake invoices that were later used to seek tax deductions.

In a statement, the Australian Crime Commission’s executive director Paul Jevtovic said: ‘The Australian Crime Commission can confirm a warrant has been issued for Philip Egglishaw’s arrest.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
