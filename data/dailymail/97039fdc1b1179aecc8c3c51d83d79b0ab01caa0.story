She was branded 'deluded' for eating a diet consisting of 20 bananas a day while pregnant but three months on from giving birth, Loni Jane Anthony says her baby is 'thriving'.

The 26-year-old Instagram sensation has hit back at her critics, who said her extreme vegan lifestyle could damage her child's health.

'It is a really good feeling to prove to a lot of people that what I was doing was the right thing,' she told 9 Stories.

'Thriving': Loni Jane Anthony says her baby boy Rowdy is happy and healthy at three-months-old

Ms Anthony gave birth to baby boy Rowdy Nash, weighing 8lbs 7oz, on March 2.

The first-time mother from Brisbane, Queensland, who was told her baby would be born 'sick' by some nutritionists, is now happy to reveal little Rowdy is 'a strong boy' who is 'meeting all these milestones'.

'I think for a lot of people they don't want to believe that something so simple actually works,' she said. 

Favourite fruit: Just like his mum, Rowdy also seems to be a fan of bananas. Loni Jane ate 20 bananas a day while pregnant

Fighting back: Loni is enjoying being a mum and says the 'negativity' about her lifestyle doesn't get to her

She added: 'The negativity doesn't get to me one bit because I know what I'm doing is right. I'm not silly and I'm not on a diet this is my lifestyle it's every single day.'

Despite having her hands full with her newborn, Ms Anthony hasn't stopped updating her Instagram account with pictures of her favourite fruit juices and colourful vegan dishes.

But Rowdy is now the star attraction of her Instagram page. The besotted mum often posts pictures of her adorable baby and even snapped him chewing on her favourite fruit - a bannana, this week.

The Australian social media identity who first came under fire six months into her pregnancy, when she claimed she would continue her plant-based diet throughout motherhood, says her diet has kept her in 'good shape'.

After giving birth, the controversial 'creative artist' boasted she was 'living proof that you don’t have to become a whale when you’re pregnant'.

'You don’t have to put on heaps of weight and never bounce back — you can stay really healthy,' she told News.com.au.

The new mother, who claims her favourite drink is a watermelon, beetroot and lemon juice, was quick to post pictures on Instagram of her taut stomach to prove just how pleased she is with her arguably risky decision.

Ms Anthony revealed, on her Tumblr page, that she plans to raise her son as a vegan. But she conceded that as he gets older 'he can then make his own decisions with that'.

When Ms Anthony first revealed her somewhat unusual diet to the world, via her blog Aleven:11, commentators deemed the pretty blonde 'irresponsible' and 'narcissistic' - especially as her Instagram account, which boasts almost 100,000 followers, features dozens of 'selfies' showcasing her slim figure.

Back in November, Shona Wilkinson, Head Nutritionist at www.nutricentre.com, told Mail Online: 'This isn't a diet I would recommend to a pregnant woman. Protein and fats are important in our diet especially during pregnancy.'

Loni Jane Anthony said that she put on 17kg (around 37lb) when pregnant but it was 'pretty much all baby and fluid'

'The amino acids that make up protein are the building blocks of your body's cells – and of your baby's body as well. It's important to get enough protein throughout your pregnancy, but especially during the second and third trimesters, when your baby is growing the fastest.'

'Some fats are particularly important during pregnancy because they support your baby's brain and eye development – both before and after birth. Fats also help the placenta and other tissues grow, and studies show that some fats may help prevent and low birth weight.'

Ms Anthony first got into predominantly eating fruit after getting sick and tired of her 'party lifestyle' which saw her binge on junk food and alcohol.

No fat allowed: Loni loves posting pictures of her plant-based meals on Instagram

'It wasn’t for weight loss or for a quick fix. I was internally really sick; I was killing myself slowly. If I’d kept living that lifestyle I would have ended up with a disease like cancer or early aging. So giving up that food was really quite simple for me,' she said.

Originally she adopted the low-fat vegan diet created by Dr Douglas M. Graham known as the 80/10/10, which is popular among athletes.

It takes its name from its recommended dietary intake: 80 per cent fruits and vegetables, ten per cent protein and ten per cent fat.

Over the past three years Ms Anthony has adapted the plan to suit her tastes - despite many of her friends deeming her 'nuts' for gorging on so many bananas.

On her blog she details a 'typical' day's menu.

'Breakfast usually consists of a mono meal of fruit (at least half a watermelon, six or more big oranges, grapes, apples, pineapple etc).

'Then either mid-morning or lunch depending on how I'm feeling and what I'm doing with usually be a one liter or more smoothie that will always consist of six or more bananas, water, dates and maybe green powder added or berries or coconut water/meat etc.'
