She's sauntered down the catwalk for Burberry, starred in Hollywood blockbusters - and even bagged herself a hot A-lister boyfriend in the form of Bradley Cooper.

And if we weren't already green with envy at Suki Waterhouse's talents, she's gone and added another string to her bow.

The 22-year-old model has designed her own range of super-cool sneakers for Superga, a brand she is already the face of.

Talented: Suki Waterhouse has designed a range of shoes for Superga, which she is currently the face of

Landing online and in stores from the end of August, Suki has 'drawn on her time in Paris' to create a capsule collection of three flatform style shoes.

The collection will be the model's first designing experience for the brand and each of the styles aims to express her 'personality, femininity and playfulness', say the brand. 

The collection features pastel shades - a sugary blue and pink - with a bolder options available in red and navy.

Putting her best foot forward: A cross between a plimsoll and a platform shoe, each of Suki's designs come in on-trend pastels

Feeling bold? Then you'll love the £68 red and blue design, which Suki says reflects her personality

A cross between a flat plimsoll and a platform shoe, each of the £68 designs are in the oh-so-now flatform style and feature hearts imprinted into the sides of the soles.

Speaking about her foray into fashion design, the supermodel said: 'I am very excited about the launch of my new collection with Superga. I really enjoyed creating for the brand and adding a piece of myself into the designs.

'I hope that everyone loves them as much as I enjoyed making them.'

Supermodel status: Suki may only be 22 but she's already walked for the biggest fashion houses and has now taken over from Alexa Chung as the face of Superga

Currently starring in the most recent Burberry AW14 campaign alongside model and friend Cara Delevingne, Suki is also considering future designing opportunities, say Superga.

For now, she is filming for the sequel to teen blockbuster Divergent called 
Insurgent, along with co-star Rosa Salazar.

The model and actress displayed her long slender legs in a 
polka-dot chiffon mini-dress as she arrived on set in Atlanta, Georgia 
on Tuesday.

Insurgent is the follow-up to Divergent, based on the series of sci-fi novels by Veronica Roth. 

The stories are set in a futuristic dystopian Chicago in which citizens are divided into factions based on their aptitude tests.
