Arrested: Dale Bolinger from Canterbury, Kent, was arrested in connection with planning acts of cannibalism with New York police officer Gilberto Valle

A nurse has been arrested by police looking into British links to New York's 'Cannibal Cop' case.

Father-of-two Dale Bolinger, 57, and an unnamed man, 30, were both arrested last week the Telegraph reports. 

British police launched an investigation after a courtroom in New York heard that accused policeman, Gilberto Valle, chatted to a contact in Britain about his fantasies of eating women.

Valle's gruesome chats with an internet user, known only as the screen name Moody Blues and an email name MeatMarketMan,  have been released in court.

The British contact boasted about eating two women alive and offered to help Valle carry out his cannibal ambitions.

Valle,
28, is currently on trial on charges of conspiracy to kidnap and 
improper use of a federal database after allegedly searching it for 
victims.

He says he never intended to go ahead with what he discussed.

British
investigators said yesterday that their work with New York police on 
the case led to the arrest of Bolinger, a married father of two and 
nurse at his local hospital, plus the unidentified man.

Arrested: Dale Bolinger, pictured, is one of two men from Canterbury, Kent in the UK who has been arrested in connection to New York's 'Cannibal Cop' case, according to reports.

On trial: New York police officer Gilberto Valle corresponded with a Pakistani and a British man about his cannibal fantasies, prosecutors say

Both have been arrested and bailed on charges of conspiracy, grooming and the possession of child abuse images.

Police did not elaborate further on the relationship to Valle's case and whether either man was involved in discussions of cannibalism.

A Kent Police spokesman said: 'Two men aged 57 and 30 from the Canterbury area were 
arrested on February 21 for conspiracy offences, grooming and the 
possession of child abuse images.

'The two men are currently on police 
bail while inquiries continue. The Kent Police have been in touch with 
law enforcement authorities in the United States in relation to this 
investigation.'

Valle's chats with his 'British mentor' revealed at Manhattan Federal Court make for shocking reading.

Target? Kathleen Mangan, right, was the subject of horrifying e-mails between Valle and other internet users. He claimed he could lure his wife to India so she could be eaten

Moody Blues talked at length about 
recipes for human flesh and boasted about having eaten two victims  - 
urging Valle to eat a victim while she was still alive.

'I think of it as eating her to 
death,' Moody Blues wrote. 'The meat isn’t quite like pork, but very 
meaty…I’ve eaten a black woman and a white person.'

The internet user also claimed to have a human recipe for haggis and claimed foot is a 'favorite' piece of meat.

Valle is believed to have met his contact through an extreme sexual fetish website before they exchanged messages last summer.

He said he wanted to be the British web user's 'assistant', and asked him for expert advice on eating human flesh.

Sobbing: Kathleen Mangan sobbed in court, shown here in a sketch, as she discussed her husband's plot to abduct, torture and eat dozens of women

In one chilling exchange the Brit 
references notorious British serial killer the Yorkshire 
Ripper when offering advice on how to kidnap women

He wrote: 'They won’t be expecting it 
if we choose different girl types. The main reason the Yorkshire Ripper 
got caught is he stuck to the same type. Don’t follow the same pattern. 
Patterns is what they look for. Anyway, girls go missing all the time.'

They also suggest flying to New York 
to help Valle in his quest and say they have anesthetic gas which could 
be used to knock out the victim as well as a 'meat cleaver'.

'Discovered': Kathleen Mangan, 28, pictured with her husband. She found the discussions on Valle's computer and reported him to the FBI

Valle's discussions were discovered 
after his wife and mother of his baby daughter, Kathleen Mangan, found 
the material on his laptop and handed it to the FBI.

He had discussed kidnapping and 
eating her as well as other female acquaintances writing that he was 
'dying to taste some girl meat'.

He wrote to another online contact that he could lure his wife to India so she could be killed and eaten, the court heard.

He claims he was only fantasizing on the internet and had no intention of doing any of the things he was talking about.

Bolinger is separated from his wife, a
prominent campaigner on disability issues in their home town of 
Canterbury, who told the newspaper she hadn't seen him for over a year. The couple have two grown-up children.

He has been suspended from nursing by East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust following his arrest.

Valle will face a life sentence if found guilty.
