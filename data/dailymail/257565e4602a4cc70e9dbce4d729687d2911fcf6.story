More than 60 million people worldwide suffer from autism, and many struggle to make eye contact and have poor social skills.

While there is no cure for the condition, the use of technology in autism treatment has grown in popularity in recent years.

And Samsung’s latest Look At Me app uses technology in a way that helps improve eye contact and boost autistic children’s social skills and facial recognition abilities.

This app was developed by Samsung, in collaboration with professors, doctors and designers in South Korea.

The team created a series of games, or ‘missions’ designed specifically to help children with autism make eye contact, read facial expressions and express their emotions.

For example, one game uses the front-facing camera to place the child’s face within a frame and take an image. This is thought to improve facial recognition and spatial awareness.

Autism is a neurological disorder that affects how a person 
communicates, and relates to, other people. It can also affect how they
 make sense of the world around them.

People
 with autism typically have trouble communicating, looking people in the
 eye, and can get upset by loud noises or bright lights.

They may also have a sensitivity to touch, tastes, smells and colours.

In particular, many autistic people like order and predictability.

Autism
 is a spectrum condition, which means that while all people with autism 
share certain difficulties, their condition affects them in different 
ways.

Some people with 
autism, for example, are able to live relatively independent lives but 
others may have accompanying learning disabilities and need specialist 
support.

Asperger syndrome is a form of autism and people with the syndrome are often of average or above average intelligence.

They have fewer problems with speech but may still have difficulties with understanding and processing language.

Another game places faces of other people in small dots over a person’s eyes. 

The child has to identify which person’s face appears in the dot from a selection.

This also teaches facial recognition, as well as the ability to pick up clues by focusing on a person’s eyes, explained the firm.

A third game asks the child to identify happy and sad faces from a line-up. This was designed to help autism sufferers recognise emotions.

For each correct answer, the users receive character cards and points, while music and voice guides can be customised to take children through the games.

During tests, 20 children were trained on the app over an eight-week period and 60 per cent of them showed a noticeable improvement.

Professor Kyong-Mee Chung from the Department of Psychology at Yonsei University said: ‘This program will help children with autism improve their social skills and relationships.’

Paediatric psychologist Hee-Jung Yoo from Seoul National University added: ‘Another benefit is that it is effective in encouraging a triangulation communication system, where children with autism can communicate with other people with the aid of a device.

Samsung’s Look At Me app isn’t the first to use technology in this way.

Toca Boca in Sweden, for example, creates apps aimed primarily at children aged between three and six.

Toca Band encourages children to make music and learn about rhythm and tempo, while Toca Hair Salon Me lets players give their family and friends virtual haircuts.

The firm calls the characters in the apps ‘digital toys’ and although the games are not specifically designed for children with autism, they have proved popular among parents who have children with the condition.

Rhiannan Walton, 32, from West London has been a speech and language therapist for eight years.

She began using technology in her therapy sessions with autistic children approximately 18 months ago.

‘Technology responds in the same way every time; you press a button and it responds how you expect it to,' Walton told MailOnline.

'This particularly appeals to autistic children who can become scared and confused by unpredictability.'

For each correct answer, the children receive character cards and points, while music and voice guides can be customised to take children through the games. The free Android app is compatible with Samsung’s Galaxy S4, S4 and S5, Galaxy Note and Zoom range, and the Galaxy Tab S

Many autistic children like trains, for example, because they are predictable. They follow set paths along stable tracks and their doors open and close in the same way each time.

For therapy to work, Ms Walton believes it has to be motivating, and technology motivates children with autism in a unique way.

‘We know therapy needs to be motivating for children in general, and games are particularly motivating for children with autism because they’re visually appealing.

‘Autistic children aren't motivated by wanting to please in the same way other children are.

‘Non-autistic children think ‘this lady wants me to play this game and if I do, she'll say well done,' but autistic children aren’t interested in that at all.

'They need to be motivated in other ways - and technology helps with this.'

Autistic children typically have visual ways of communicating, and as a result have a visual way of learning and this is why apps are so effective, Ms Walton concluded.

In a recent study, researchers from 
Canada studied 12 children in six classrooms across Ontario, all of whom
 have non-verbal autism spectrum disorder.

These classrooms were given Apple iPads for a six-month trial.

Following
 the experiment, nine of the students showed a statistical improvement 
ranging from mild to significant in their overall communication skills.

The
 devices were also found to boost motivation among 75 per cent of the 
children, while also increasing their attention span and ability to 
interact socially.

Topcliffe
 Primary School in Birmingham recently introduced touchscreen devices 
into classrooms and similarly noticed an improvement among the autistic 
students.

‘We watched 
children with autism playing with the images on the screen in ways in 
which none of the typically developing children had done, said 
Topcliffe’s spectrum disorders teacher Sarah Quickenden.

‘The normal curriculum that we were offering just wasn't allowing them to demonstrate these skills to us. We never realised that the children had these skills because some of them are so locked in.’
