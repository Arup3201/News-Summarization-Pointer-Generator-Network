Peter Clarke, former head of Scotland Yard's anti-terror unit, has been asked to look into allegations of an extremist Muslim takeover plot at schools in Birmingham

The anti-terror police chief who led the investigation into the 7/7 London bombings has been picked to look into an alleged plot to put Muslim extremists in charge of schools in Birmingham.

Peter Clarke, 58, who ran the Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism unit, has been made Education Commissioner and will review the evidence in connection with the allegations, the Department for Education (DfE) said today.

His role will be to conduct a thorough investigation into the situation and work with Birmingham City Council to 'analyse evidence of extremist infiltration in both academies and council-run schools', the Department said.

The DfE said that Mr Clarke has substantial experience in leading high-level investigations, and his appointment means that the allegations can be examined in a 'professional and dispassionate manner'.

The move comes the day after it was disclosed that 25 schools are now under investigation over the alleged hardline Muslim plot to force out governors and headteachers.

Birmingham City Council has already announced the appointment of Ian Kershaw as chief adviser to directly handle at least 200 complaints received in relation to the Operation Trojan Horse allegations focusing on schools in the city.

The council's investigation, running next to the DfE's separate inquiry, is due to initially report back in May.

Mr Gove said: 'I am extremely concerned by the allegations made in connection to a number of schools in Birmingham.

'I have already asked Ofsted to inspect a number of schools of concern and these investigations are ongoing. But wider, more comprehensive action is needed.

'These allegations need either to be substantiated and firm action taken, or to be shown to be baseless. We cannot allow uncertainty for parents or pupils to persist.

'That is why I am appointing a Commissioner to oversee this work. Peter Clarke brings a wealth of relevant skills and experience, and is very well placed to lead a fair and thorough assessment of the evidence, and report back to me. We expect he will work closely with Birmingham City Council.

'No pupils should be exposed to extremist views or radicalisation while at school. I have tasked Peter Clarke with getting to the bottom of these allegations, so schools in Birmingham can continue the excellent progress that so many have been making.'

Mr Clarke is due to report back with his findings in the summer. His remit will cover both local council-run schools and academies.

Today West Midlands chief constable, Chris Sims criticised Mr Clarke's appointment, calling it 'desperately unfortunate'.

Mr Sims said: 'Peter Clarke has many qualities, but people will inevitably draw unwarranted conclusions from his former role as national co-ordinator for counter terrorism.'

Birmingham City Council announced the appointment of former headteacher Mr Kershaw, managing director of Northern Education, as its chief adviser, and said it was also setting up a review group of MPs, councillors, national teaching and governors groups, the police, and faith leaders, to look into the claims.

Education Secretary Michael Gove said he hoped Mr Clarke, who led the investigation into the 7/7 London bombings, right, which killed 52, would conduct a thorough probe into the Birmingham school allegations

Its council leader Sir Albert Bore 
confirmed the council had also spoken to the local authorities in both 
Manchester and Bradford, during its three-month long investigation, 
where similar allegations have been raised.

Ofsted has also been sent in by Mr Gove to inspect 15 Birmingham schools in recent weeks, after the allegations first broke.  The results of these snap inspections are due back next month.

Concerns over how some of the city's 430 schools were being run first emerged when an anonymous letter known as Operation Trojan Horse was leaked, claiming that a small but radical group of Muslims were pursuing their own agenda in the classrooms, with uncooperative headteachers and governors forced out.

The unsigned and undated 'Trojan Horse' document also claimed to have caused 'a great amount of organised disruption' in the city, crediting the plan with forcing a change of leadership at four schools.

Lindsey Clark, the headteacher of Park View, said she would act against anyone plotting against the school

Since the letter came to light, anonymous whistle-blowers have claimed that boys and girls were segregated in classrooms and assemblies, sex education was banned, non-Muslim staff bullied, and in one case it was alleged that the teachings of a firebrand Al Qaeda-linked Muslim preacher praised to pupils.

Sir Albert said the council was 'in dialogue' with the DfE, and confirmed none of the Ofsted inspection reports would be published by the education watchdog until after Easter.

West Midlands Police is also still looking into the authorship of the document, the council's leader said.

The allegations detailed in the Trojan Horse letter focus on the Park View Educational Trust, which runs three schools in the city - all of which have been subjected to snap Ofsted inspections in recent weeks.

Among further claims which have since come to light, one former anonymous staff member at Park View Academy in Alum Rock alleged a colleague had in an assembly praised the firebrand Al Qaeda-linked Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki - he was killed by a US drone strike in Yemen in 2011.

The school trustees have firmly denied all the claims, branding the allegations 'a witch-hunt', while pointing to very good academic results among its pupils.

Born in 1955, Peter Clarke was educated at the Glyn School, Epsom, Surrey, before attending the University of Bristol where he read law.

After graduation, he joined the Metropolitan Police in 1977, becoming an inspector in 1984 and a detective inspector in 1986.  Two years later, he joined the National Drugs Intelligence Unit, and in 1990 he was promoted to Operations Chief, central London division.

Mr Clarke progressed from being Met commissioner in 1993 to become Brixton Divisional Commander from 1994-1997.  He spent three more years as head of the Protection Command from 1997-2000, which meant he was in charge of Royal protection when Diana, Princess of Wales died in Paris in 1997.

As Deputy Assistant Commissioner with the Specialist Operations team, Mr Clarke was Britain's top anti-terror police officer

From 2000-2002, he was deputy director of personnel, before becoming head of the Anti-Terrorist branch in summer 2002.  This later merged with Special Branch to become the Counter Terror Command, which put Mr Clarke in charge of the investigation into the 7/7 bombings and the failed London bombings of 21 July 2005.

Mr Clarke, who is married with three children, retired as Assistant Commissioner, Specialist Operations in 2008.  His retirement was delayed at the request of then-Commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, following the resignation of Andy Hayman over champagne expense claims.
