Millionaire fashion designer Dame Vivienne Westwood has suggested families who can’t afford to buy organic food should simply ‘eat less’.

She was delivering a petition to Downing Street outlining concerns about genetically modified crops.

But when she was challenged by a BBC Radio 5Live reporter who said ‘not everybody can afford to eat organic food’, the 73-year-old replied they should stop eating so much.

However, she softened her tone when it was suggested that eating less isn’t an option for the poorest.

Millionaire fashion designer Dame Vivienne Westwood (pictured at theNetflix documentary screening of 'Virunga') has suggested families who can’t afford to buy organic food should simply ‘eat less’

She replied: ‘They don’t have any choice – this is the point. You’ve got all these processed foods, which is the main reason people are getting fat.

‘I eat vegetables and fruit. I don’t eat meat. I believe meat is bad for me so I don’t eat it. It’s also bad for the animals.

‘If there was a movement to produce more organic food and less of the horrible food, then organic food would obviously be a good value price.’

The comments were immediately criticised online.

One Twitter user said she ‘totally fails to understand people in the UK are struggling to pay their bills’. Another said: ‘Lower orders & peasants have a duty to starve, says “anti-capitalist” champagne socialist.’

Dame Vivienne said: ‘I’m deeply upset if anyone would think I don’t care about starving people or don’t understand the terrible situation some people are in, quite the opposite, I have spent years campaigning for social and human rights issues.

'My comments were related to eating less meat. People are eating far too much factory farmed meat and junk food which is bad for you and not providing the nutrients you need. You can source good food and organic farmed meat for less.’

 It is not the first time the designer, who is thought to have a fortune of at least £10million, has sparked outrage with similar controversial views.

Shortly before the Scottish independence referendum in September, Dame Westwood she said she ‘hates England’. Miss Westwood lives in a smart townhouse in Clapham, south London

Last month she said that ‘clothes should cost more’, adding: ‘Food should cost more too. Something is wrong when you can buy a cooked chicken for £2.’

Despite making her fortune from selling clothes, she added: ‘Fashion is a terrible thing, it’s all about tempting to buy. But they should buy less.’

Shortly before the Scottish independence referendum in September, Dame Westwood she said she ‘hates England’, adding: ‘I like Scotland because somehow I think they are better than we are. They are more democratic.’

In March, she was criticised by campaigners after she said that eating vegetarian food can cure disabled people.

And two years ago, she said the people of Britain ‘have never looked to ugly’, adding: Everybody looks like clones and the only people you notice are my age.

‘I don’t notice anybody unless they look great, and every now and again they do, and they are usually 70.

‘We are so conformist, nobody is thinking. We are all sucking up stuff, we have been trained to be consumers and we are all consuming far too much.’

Miss Westwood lives in a smart townhouse in Clapham, south London with her husband Andreas Kronthaler, who is 25 years her junior. 

She recently revealed they share their bathwater, saying: ‘Normally at home I’m not used to the habit of a shower. I just wash my bits and rush out in the morning and more often than not get in the bath after Andreas.’
