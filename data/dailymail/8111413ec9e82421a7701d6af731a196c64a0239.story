Former Sheffield United striker Ched Evans could be set for a shock return to his old club with reports suggesting that he could be allowed to start training in July.

Evans, 25, could be allowed to participate in pre-season training on day-release whilst tagged according to the Mirror.

The striker was convicted of rape in 2012 for raping a 19-year-old woman in a hotel room in Rhyl, North Wales.

The reports suggest that Saudi Arabian Prince Abdullah bin Mossad bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, who is one of the world's richest men and Sheffield United's co-owner, has given his approval for Evans' return.

Return: Evans' return to Sheffield United would generally be well received says the Supporters' club chairman

Pete Whitney, who is the Supporters' club chairman, has said 'Ched is coming back. He has his prime years ahead of him.

'I am sure he will get a good reception but of course thee might be a small minority who will object.'

Evans has said he plans to appeal against his conviction and his girlfriend Natsaha Massey told the Sunday People that she still supports him and plans to get engaged saying 'Ched loves the club and supporters. He wants his old job back.'

The Welsh striker was a promising player when he moved from Manchester CIty in 2009 for Â£3 million and during the 2011/12 season scored 35 goals for Sheffield United in League One.

Almost 60,000 have signed a petition addressed to Kevin McCabe, the club's chairman, urging him not to resign Evans.

An extract reads: 'For the male leaders of the club to endorse him and "welcome him back" is an absolute humiliation to all women who expect the men who commit gross acts of violence against women to pay for what they have done and part of that is relinquishing the celebrity they attained, and in this case used as a tool to facilitate the violence.

'The clear message to young boys and men is that you will be forgiven for this crime. Women will not be believed when they accuse you of that crime even if a court believes them.

'The message given is that men who commit such atrocious crimes will suffer only a small penance whilst the women they attack suffer for the rest of their lives.'

One supporter wrote: 'I want to feel safe in a city that takes a strong stance against sexual assault, not a city that ignores and rewards it.'
