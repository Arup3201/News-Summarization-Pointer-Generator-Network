A video could prove crucial in finding out who dumped 35 corpses near a shopping mall in a Mexican Gulf coast city during rush hour - and why.

Police are still trying to determine who was responsible for the gruesome incident, in which suspected drug traffickers drove two trucks to a main avenue and dumped the dead bodies while gunmen stood guard and pointed their weapons at terrified motorists.

It is feared the incident, which happened in downtown Boco del Rio earlier this week, is the latest escalation in drug violence in the Veracruz state - an area which sits on an important route for drugs and Central American migrants heading north.

Drugs war: Police have identified most of the victims and all had records for murder, drug dealing, kidnapping and extortion and were linked to organised crime

Gruesome task: Police and Mexican army soldiers take away the 35 bodies which were dumped near Boca del Rio's biggest shopping mall. Some reports said 12 women were among the dead

Footage is being examined in the hope
of finding out how the men managed to drive two open-back trucks, 
filled with corpses, through rush-hour traffic before dumping them in 
front of shocked onlookers.

Reynaldo Escobar Perez, Veracruz's 
Attorney General, said in a radio interview yesterday that the video may 
reveal the trucks being guarded by other cars, which could have doubled 
as getaway vehicles.

Escobar Perez also said they were looking into whether police colluded with the people who dumped the bodies.

He confirmed that by yesterday 
morning (Wednesday) most of the bodies had been identified through 
police databases; most of them had criminal records and one of them had 
been identified as a local policeman who disappeared 15 days ago.

The bodies and abandoned trucks were 
found by police close to a shopping mall on Tuesday, September 20. The 
corpses has spilled out of the vehicle and into the road. The shirt-less
bodies, piled on top of each other, were clearly visible from people 
crossing a nearby overpass.

Mexico's state prosecutors and court officials were due to meet in Boco del Rio today.

Jose Reveles, a security analyst, 
told CNN: 'This is a way of making yourself known, and saying, "We have 
the power, we can do this with impunity".

'We do it at five in the evening, in a heavily travelled avenue. We drive two trucks loaded with cadavers, and nobody stops us.'

Veracruz has seen an increase in 
drug-related violence as a turf war escalates. The Zetas drug cartel has
been locked in a bloody war with drug gangs for control of the state.

The dead include 23 men and 12 women, with witnesses saying the bodies were dumped 'like trash in the street'.

Describing the grisly discovery as 
'unprecedented', Escobar Perez said in a separate interview that the 
victims could have died from suffocation, with only one being found with
a bullet wound.

He also said that none of the bodies 
identified had been connected to three prison breaks in Veracruz on 
Tuesday, which saw 32 inmates escape.

Motorists caught in the horrifying 
scene posted message on Twitter warning that masked gunmen in military 
uniforms were blocking Manuel Avila Camacho Boulevard and pointing their
guns at civilians.

'They don't seem to be soldiers or police,' one tweet read. Another said: 'Don't go through that area, there is danger.'

Earlier this week, the Mexican army announced it had captured a key figure in 
the cult-like Knights Templar drug cartel that is sowing violence in 
western Mexico.

Saul Solis Solis, 49, a former police chief and one-time congressional candidate, was captured without incident on Monday in the cartel's home state of Michoacan, Brigadier General Edgar Luis Villegas said during a presentation of Solis to the media.

Solis is considered to be one of the principal lieutenants in the Knights Templar, which split late last year from La Familia, a pseudo-religious drug gang known as a major trafficker of methamphetamine.

Drug violence has claimed more than 35,000 lives across Mexico since 2006, according to government figures. Others put the number at more than 40,000.

In northern Mexico, the army announced the detention of two more suspects in a casino fire that killed 52 people last month in the northern city of Monterrey.

The two men captured at a bar in Monterrey late on Monday confessed to being members of the Zetas drug cartel and participating in the attack, federal prosecutors said.

Separately in Nuevo Leon, Mexican marines captured 19 alleged members of the Zetas drug cartel at a ranch that was being used as a training camp in the town of Colombia, the military announced.

A navy statement said that seven minors were among those detained and that marines seized four rifles, a pistol, and several military uniforms and boots.
