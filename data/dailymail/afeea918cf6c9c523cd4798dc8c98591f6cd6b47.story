Buzz Aldrin, the astronaut who was the second man to walk on the moon, has said he wants the US to permanently 'settle and colonise Mars.'

And the 83-year-old former astronaut expects it to become a reality by 2040.

Aldrin made the statement in a blog for CNN and his plans to get there form the basis of his new book Mission to Mars.

The second man to walk on the moon, Buzz Aldrin, wants the US to colonise Mars and believes there will be a settlement on the red planet by by 2040

Astronaut Buzz Aldrin, lunar module pilot, walks on the surface of the Moon. It's been 44 years since the Apollo 11 landings and Aldrin thinks there has been 'too little progress' since

A group of scientists are trying to replicate what it would be like to live on Mars, by living and working in spacesuits in the Utah desert.

Engineers, geologists and biologists from the Mars Desert Research Station are living in cramped conditions with limited water, electricity, food and oxygen, a vast distance from home.

The 'astronauts' are a group of volunteers who are helping to discover ways to investigate the feasibility of a human exploration of Mars and use the Utah desert's Mars-like terrain to simulate working conditions on the red planet.

Aldrin said: 'I have always felt Mars should be the next destination following our landings on the moon.

'I believe this nation should commit itself, within two decades, to commencing American permanence on the planet Mars.'

Aldrin added that the advances made by Nasa's Curiosity Rover and the pictures it has beamed back from the red planet have added to public interest.

'The dream of reaching the red planet looks like it is finally getting closer to becoming a reality.'

It has been 44 years since the Apollo 11 moonwalk and Aldrin thinks there has been 'too little progress' in getting people to settle on other planets.

This image from NASA TV was one of the first images sent from the Curiosity rover after it successfully landed on Mars in August 2012. Aldrin believes that the discoveries made by the rover are key for humans looking to settle on the red planet

He said he has devised a method to get 
there with cycling orbits of spacecraft on continuous trajectories 
between the Earth and Mars.

Aldrin believes this is the most economical transportation system concept between the two planets.

He believes that using this capability, humans could arrive and settle on Mars between 2035-2040.

Aldrin's plan is outlined in his new book, Mission to Mars: My Vision for Space Exploration out now.

He continues: 'We are at an inflection point.

'We can choose to do what is easy, what is safe.

'Or we can choose to make a difference. The choice to me is absolutely clear.

'There is no other choice than to commit to Mars.

'Humans need to explore, to push beyond current limits, just like we did nearly 44 years ago that enabled me to stand at Tranquility Base on the moon.

'In reaching outward with method and intent to Mars, America is once again in the business of a vital, meaningful and future-focused space exploration program.'

More than 78,000 people recently applied to go on a Dutch reality TV show in which they would move to Mars permanently.

The company, called Mars One, believes it will have a colony on the planet by 2023.
