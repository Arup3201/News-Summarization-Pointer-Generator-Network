A teenager has become the only apprentice wheelwright in Britain working at one of only two firms appointed to take care of the Queen’s historic royal carriages.

George Richards, 17, has been learning his trade at Mike Rowland Wheelwrights and Coachbuilders since September.

As part of his three-year training scheme at the smoke and steam-filled workshop in Colyton, Devon, he has now produced an unusual wooden bicycle for a special visit from the Master of the Worshipful Company of Wheelwrights.

The youngster, who also studies joinery at Exeter College, has impressed the old hands at the business - which was formed in 1964 but can be traced back through the family as far as 1360.

Greg Rowland, 44, who has now taken over the business from his 77-year-old father Mike said George’s ability was clear as a work experience boy aged 15.

'He seemed to have a little bit more about him than the typical kid who plays computer games so I tossed him an 11-inch piece of elm for a wagon wheel hub and he nailed first time on the lathe,' said Mr Rowland. 

'The next thing I had Exeter College wanting me to complete a pre-apprentice report - it seems he had told them he already had a place.

'I like that attitude. If you want something go for it. We needed somebody and he timed it just right.

'I like his enthusiasm, the way he did it all himself, not getting his mum to do it but just sorted it out.'

A wheelwright is a person who builds or repairs wooden wheels and wheeled vehicles.

The occupational name eventually became the surname Wheelwright.

The firm, which is allowed to display the royal coat of arms along with the sought-after credit 'by appointment to Her Majesty the Queen' is thriving as it marks its 50th anniversary this year with enough work to last 18 months on the books.

It specialises in military equipment often for museums such as the giant cannon wheels which weigh one third of a tonne and stand five-and-a-half feet tall on their wooden rims.

Greg is not allowed to talk in detail about the royal work but says a job for the Queen has to take preference despite the long order book. 

A job involving a working vehicle, such as a wedding carriage, would also jump the queue.

The company where George is carrying out his apprenticeship is one of two firms in the country that makes carriages for the Queen like the one pictured

George’s family have lived in the small Colyton community for generations - his grandfather was an undertaker and carpenter.

Aside from his joinery apprenticeship at Exeter he is also working towards becoming a wheelwright thanks to a separate scheme by the Livery Companies Apprentice Scheme which pays his wages.

This will give him a City and Guilds and then see him being confirmed as a journeyman wheelwright at a ceremony in the City of London.

Mr Rowland said: 'He is doing really well - he designed and made the bike completely by himself.'
