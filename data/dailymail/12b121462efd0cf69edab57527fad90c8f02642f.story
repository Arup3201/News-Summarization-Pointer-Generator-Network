Investigation: The request could be a step forward in the search for Madeleine McCann

The prospect of arrests over Madeleine McCann's disappearance moved a step closer today after Portugal's Attorney General's office confirmed it had received a formal request for help from UK prosecutors.

A spokesman for the country's top law officer confirmed it was in receipt of an International Letter of Request thought to ask for access to three 'prime suspects' - but declined to discuss its contents.

The spokesman said the letter would now be forwarded to a court in the Algarve resort of Portimao tasked with investigating the newly-reopened case in Portugal.

Authorities declined to give a timescale on when the letter would be sent or actioned.

Scotland Yard are understood to want to question three local burglars blamed for a string of break-ins in Praia da Luz where Madeleine was snatched in May 2007.

Portuguese detectives acting on a first International Letter of Request sent by Britain last July discovered the men were very close to the scene of Madeleine's disappearance and made an unusually high number of calls to each other in the hours after her abduction.

Portugal's Attorney General's office announced last October the Madeleine McCann inquiry, shelved nearly six years ago, was being reopened at the request of police in Porto who have spent the past three years reviewing the case.

Jose Magalhaes e Menezes, the public prosecutor in charge of the original investigation, is overseeing the reopened inquiry.

He was damning of the original probe pointing the finger at Madeleine's parents Kate and Gerry and claimed officers under disgraced former police chief Goncalo Amaral achieved "very little" during their 15 month investigation.

Amaral has claimed in a book which is the subject of an on-going libel trial that the McCanns covered up their daughter's death in their holiday apartment.

Scotland Yard detectives are conducting their own separate criminal inquiry into Madeleine's disappearance called Operation Grange.

Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, who is leading the Met operation, has said he continues to believe Madeleine is still alive.

Operation Grange was first launched as a review in 2011 following the intervention of David Cameron in the case.

A spokesman for Madeleine's parents has described the International Letter of Request as a significant development.
