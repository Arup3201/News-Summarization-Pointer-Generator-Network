A gay immigrant who was jailed for eight years after a series of 'extremely violent' attacks will not be deported because he is now straight.

Naushad Saboor successfully argued he should stay in Britain because 'his sexual orientation was transformed from homosexual to firmly heterosexual'.

The Sri Lankan was sent to prison at Snaresbrook Crown Court in London 11 years ago for two counts of GBH after he lost control after a series of homophobic comments were made.

Changed man: Naushad Saboor will not be deported after he went from gay to straight, despite being jailed at Snaresbrook Crown Court (pictured) for eight years in 2002

But after his release from jail in 2007 
he was no longer gay, and married a British 
woman and they had a child together.

Angry: Tory Philip Davies said the decision by judges to allow the Sri Lankan to stay in Britain was 'perverse'

At the same time he applied for asylum, which was rejected because he had shown 'no remorse' for his crimes.

But after launching an appeal using European human rights rules, he successfully argued that being kicked out of the UK would deny him the right to a family life.

The Home Office then appealed the decision but incredibly Mr Justice Clive Lane backed Saboor instead of the Government, despite admitting his story that he went from gay to straight lacked credibility.

Tory MP Philip Davies has called it a 'perverse decision to allow a dangerous foreign criminal to stay in our country'.

'As far as I'm concerned the human rights rules and laws in our country and our judges are both as daft as each other,' he said.

'The combination of the two gives us these ridiculous judgements.

'It is these cases that prove we need top scrap it. It seems that the only people who seem to use it are prisoners and illegal immigrants.'

The Home Office said cases like this one is 'precisely why we are looking to change the law in the new Immigration Bill this year'.

Excuse: Foreign criminals have frequently used European human rights law to prevent them being deported

It came as yesterday an illegal immigrant who was jailed for beating his children was told he cannot be deported because it would breach his right to a family life.

Antonio Alfredo Bazomba, 49, was sentenced to two years in prison for kicking and punching his two sons and a daughter.

But an attempt by the Home Office to have him deported following his sentence has been rejected because he is a changed man and now has a good relationship with the children he attacked.
