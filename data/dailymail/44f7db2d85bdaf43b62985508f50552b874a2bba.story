The Connecticut Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that state officials aren't violating the rights of a 17-year-old girl by forcing her to undergo cancer chemotherapy she doesn't want.

The decision came in the case of the girl known in court documents only as Cassandra C., who will be free to make her own medical decisions when she turns 18 in September. 

She, with the support of her mother, had fought against the six-month course of chemotherapy which doctors said would give her an 85 per cent chance of survival.

The case centered on whether the girl is mature enough to determine how to treat her Hodgkin lymphoma, which she was diagnosed with in September. Several other states recognize the 'mature minor doctrine.'

Cassandra's chemo resumed on December 17, with surgery to install a port in her chest that would be used to administer the drugs, after she initially refused the treatment for her Hodgkin lymphoma

Jackie Fortin, pictured on January 2, at her home in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, said she and her daughter just want to seek alternative treatments that don't include the 'poison' of chemotherapy 

The court ruled that her lawyers had the opportunity to prove her maturity during a Juvenile Court hearing in December and failed to do so 'under any standard'.

The teen, for example, was allowed to go home to undergo treatment in November but instead ran away for a week, according to court documents.

'Cassandra either intentionally misrepresented her intentions to the trial court or she changed her mind on this issue of life and death,' Chief Justice Chase T. Rogers said.

Hodgkins lymphoma (cells pictured) is a disease of the white blood cells 

Hodgkin's Lymphoma is cancer of the white blood cells called B lymphocytes that circulate around the lymphatic system, which is a network of vessels and glands spread throughout the body.

The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes.

Lymphoma causes the lymphocytes to multiply in an abnormal way and collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes or glands. These lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection.

The most common symptom of HL is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin. It usually affects young adults aged between 15 and 35 and adults over the age of 50.

The cause is unknown but risk factors include medical conditiona that weakens your immune system, taking immunosuppressant medication and being previously exposed to the Epstein-Barr virus (which causes glandular fever).

It isn't thought a family member having the disease increases the chances of developing it. The only way to confirm a diagnosis of HL is by carrying out a biopsy.

Almost all young people with HL will be fully cured. For older people over the age of 50, the cure rate is around 75 per cent to 80 per cent.

Treatment depends on the extent of the cancer and will usually involve a combination of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and drugs including steroids. 

A more lengthy written decision will come at a later date, she said.

Cassandra currently is confined in a room at Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford, where she is being forced to undergo chemotherapy. Without it, they said there was a near-certainty of death within two years.

The teen's mother, Jackie Fortin of Windsor Locks, said after the arguments on Thursday that she wouldn't allow her daughter to die. 

The single mother said she and her daughter just want to seek alternative treatments that don't include putting the 'poison' of chemotherapy into her daughter's body.

'This is her decision and her rights, which is what we are here fighting about,' Fortin said. 

'We should have choices about what to do with our bodies.'

Fortin and her lawyer said they are considering their next step after losing the case, but expect to go back to the trial court in an attempt to more fully explore the mature minor argument.

After Cassandra was diagnosed with high-risk Hodgkin lymphoma, she and her mother missed several appointments, prompting doctors at Connecticut Children's Medical Center to notify the state Department of Children and Families, court documents said.

The child welfare agency investigated and a trial court granted the agency temporary custody of Cassandra. 

Lawyers for Cassandra and her mother then sought an injunction prohibiting medical treatment but were unsuccessful.

Cassandra's treatment resumed on December 17, with surgery to install a port in her chest that would be used to administer the drugs. Chemotherapy began the next day and continues.

Assistant Attorney General said Cassandra exhibited the 'magical thinking' of an immature child, believing that if she ignored the cancer it would go away and using the slang of the day was 'blowing off the severity of her condition'.

Child welfare agency officials defended their treatment of Cassandra, saying they have a responsibility to protect the girl's life.

'This is a curable illness, and we will continue to ensure that Cassandra receives the treatment she needs to become a healthy and happy adult,' the agency said in a statement.
