West Brom have completed the £4.75million signing of Wigan's Callum McManaman on a three-and-a-half year deal.

The winger agreed a contract, which includes a 12-month option, after undergoing a medical on Wednesday morning.

He becomes Tony Pulis' first signing at The Hawthorns and could make his debut against Tottenham on Saturday.

The 23-year-old told the club's official site: 'I'm really made up to have joined.

'When the chance came to move to West Bromwich Albion and return to the Premier League I couldn't turn it down.

'This is a great move for me and I hope the Albion fans will get to see the best of me.

'Albion are a great club, with a good tradition. I can't wait to get going.'

West Brom had two bids rejected for McManaman before a third offer was made over the weekend.

McManaman has scored five goals in 23 games for the Sky Bet Championship strugglers, who are second bottom of the table, this season.

He won the FA Cup with the Latics following their 1-0 win over Manchester City in 2013.
