Dressing more casually in the office may be frowned upon in many workplaces, but it could actually be helping to tackle climate change.

Researchers from Lancaster University found that as more people wear hoodies, jeans and warmer clothes, offices no longer need to be heated to the same levels they used to be.

By reducing office temperatures, it will reduce the amount of energy that is wasted, and have a positive effect on CO2 emissions, and ultimately, global climates.

Reducing temperatures will help tackle climate change

Most people expect normal room 
temperature to be about 22°C and around half the 
energy used in buildings is used to maintain this temperature.

This temperature comes from Professor Povl Ole Fanger's thermal comfort equation from 1970.

Professor Fanger,
 a Danish engineer, developed a method for working out how much heating 
and cooling would be required to keep people 'comfortable' within 
buildings.

To come to this 
conclusion, Fanger made assumptions about what people wore.

Fanger's equation refers to a unit called the 'Clo', first developed in 1941.

The
 Clo represents the insulation value of clothing and a man's lightweight business suit, for example, is the 
equivalent to one Clo.

‘Standard
 room temperatures suppose standard clothing - and by default, buildings
 are designed for people wearing suits,’ said Professor Elizabeth Shove.

The DEMAND Research Centre, based at the university, said people should be adjusting their dress codes both at work and at home, rather than the dials on their heating systems, to combat rising global temperatures.

Currently, heating and cooling systems in the office and at home are designed to provide 'comfortable' conditions for people wearing lightweight clothing, such as suits.

As more people wear casual, thicker clothing, these buildings need less energy.

‘There is no doubt that the move away from formal office wear towards jeans, hoodies and more casual clothes is reducing the need for workplaces to be heated to the same degree,’ said Professor Elizabeth Shove from the research centre.

‘And in hot climates, why not change dress codes rather than cooling buildings to counter the effect of wearing a suit and tie? These are not entirely fanciful questions.’

She added: ‘Most people expect normal room temperature to be about 22°C, but very few know why this is the case. That figure is neither natural, nor inevitable, but is hugely important.

Researchers said much less energy would be needed if room temperatures swung with the seasons, and if people adjusted their clothing to suit

‘Around half the energy used in buildings is used to keep them at this temperature, all over the world; whatever the weather outside.’

This temperature comes from Professor Povl Ole Fanger's thermal comfort equation from 1970.

Professor Fanger, a Danish engineer, developed a method for working out how much heating and cooling would be required to keep people 'comfortable' within buildings.

To come to this conclusion, Fanger - as well as heating engineers and architects ever since – made assumptions about what people wear.

Fanger's equation refers to a unit called the 'Clo', first developed in 1941.

The Clo represents the insulation value of clothing and a man's lightweight business suit, for example, is the equivalent to one Clo.

‘Standard room temperatures suppose standard clothing - and by default, buildings are designed for people wearing suits,’ continued Professor Shove.

‘Many other standards follow; electronic technologies are typically designed to work best at 22°C.

‘Such devices are prone to fail if they overheat and this is especially important in justifying the spread of air conditioning where none existed before.

‘As more and more buildings are designed to provide 22°C, this becomes the norm. It becomes what people expect and when that happens, anything other than 22°C begins to seem uncomfortable.

‘From an environmental point of view and on a global scale, the massive energy demand that ensues is unsustainable.

‘Much less energy would be needed, if room temperatures swung with the seasons and if people adjusted their clothing - and their daily routines - to suit.

In 2005, the Japanese government refused to heat or cool public buildings between 20°C and 28°C as part of its Cool Biz programme.

‘As the Cool Biz initiative demonstrates, room temperature can be redefined,’ said Professor Shove.

‘Looking forward, there is no reason to suppose that standards, which are normal, now, will remain so in the future.’
