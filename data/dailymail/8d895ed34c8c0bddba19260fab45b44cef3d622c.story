Moneymaking potential: Twitter's new Ads API will give advertisers new tools to personalise their campaigns to its 200million active users

Twitter has launched a new automated advertising feature in a bid to help ensure paid-for promotional tweets are seen by the right users as it seeks to replicate Facebook's money-making success.

In an announcement on product manager April Underwood's blog, she revealed the new system for advertisers - but stopped short of saying there would be no increase in the number of adverts.

The microblogging site's new Ads API (application programming interface) will let advertisers tailor their campaigns to relevant members of Twitter's 200million active users.

Facebook launched similar technology in 2010, helping the social network to boost its revenues to more than $3billion the following year.

As speculation grows that Twitter will follow Facebook with a stock market float, it seems the company's executives likewise hope to unlock their sites moneymaking potential.

Twitter users already sometimes see paid-for tweets among the posts from people, organisations and companies they have chosen to follow.

The company said the new system will not lead to more ads appearing in users news-feeds.

'As interest in Twitter has grown, our focus has been on delivering better ads for users, not more ads,' said April Underwood.

'We believe our system is working well because users like the ads experience on Twitter. Our system rewards marketers for being good, not for being loud.

'And this approach encourages ads that are engaging, relevant and useful.'

The new system has been undergoing tests since January with a set of five initial partners who have built advertising products that sync with Twitter's new API.

Until now, companies have to manually manage their advertising campaigns on Twitter. The new Ads API automates that process by giving them tools to 'deliver the right message, to the right audience'.

It also allows advertisers to integrate their Twitter campaigns with promotional strategies elsewhere, including on Google, Facebook and LinkedIn.

Ms Underwood told the Financial Times there would be 'no direct impact on the user experience', merely that the service's users should see 'more relevant and better ads'.

She did not rule out an increase in the number of ads shown, but insisted the company took users' experience 'really seriously'.

The new system will almost certainly increase Twitter's advertising revenue, which could help increase the company's value ahead of a rumoured initial public offering planned for next year.

Analysts say Facebook's equivalent system now generates roughly 60 per cent of the company's revenues.
