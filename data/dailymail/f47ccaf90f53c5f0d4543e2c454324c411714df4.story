Cashing in: Bookies are taking bets on everything from the baby's birthday to its name and hair colour

James has emerged as a clear favourite for the name of the little Prince last night – at least among the betting public.

At 2/1, it overtook the earlier leader among boys’ names, George, which is now 5/1 as is Henry – Prince Harry’s real name.

Most punters had clearly expected a girl, with Alexandra the favourite at 7/4.

Bookmakers Coral said the royal birth 
was the biggest non-sporting betting event in the company’s history with
 cash staked on everything including hair colour and weight.

The name the Duke and Duchess of 
Cambridge choose will set a trend for a generation of babies, with other
 new parents having a boy anxious to copy them.

James has links to both families, but 
William already has a cousin called James - the Earl and Countess of 
Wessex's son Viscount Severn.

George has been the name of six Kings of England and was the Sovereign name of the Queen’s father, George VI, whose actual first name was Albert.

It is also one of Prince Charles’ middle names.

From Williams’s side of the family both his father’s name, which the Prince of Wales share with Princess Diana’s brother, Earl Spencer, and his grandfather’s are likely favourites.

At the bookies however, Charles did not even hit top ten with William Hill, and Phillip-betters will take home 40 times the money if they win.

The Cambridges are also likely to 
take inspiration from Kate's side of the family, possibly honouring her 
father Michael, or picking Francis, which is both her father
 and her grandfather's middle name.

Princess Diana's middle name was Frances, the feminine form of the name, meaning William could honour his mother's memory through his son.

Less likely are older Middleton family names such as Kate's maternal grandfather, who was called Ronald, however Thomas appears several times on both sides of Kate's family.

The announcement that the Duchess was in labour sent punters to the betting shops, and bookmaker Paddy Power said they took £390,000 in bets in the three hours after this morning's news.

Bets on the date of birth were suspended earlier today by bookmaker William Hill, and when bets on the gender were suspended, odds on it being a girl were at 8/15, and odds on a boy stood at 11/8.

Odds with Coral this morning wrongly predicted a girl, with with odds of 1-2, while the odds on a boy stood at 6-4.

The bookmaker said the baby's birth has been the biggest non-sporting event in the company's history.

1) James (2/1)

2) George (5/1)

3) Henry (5/1)

4) Arthur (20/1)

5) Louis (25/1)

6) Albert (40/1)

7) Alexander (40/1)

8) Benjamin (40/1)

9) David (40/1)

10) Philip (40/1)

Had there been a princess born this afternoon, the most popular names were Alexandra, with the odds 9/4 and Charlotte at 5/1.

Once the Duke and Duchess have given their baby boy his names, Queen will 
be informed of the before they are announced officially, 
but she is unlikely to exercise her veto.

Royal writer Christopher Warwick 
said: 'The Queen is so down to earth that she's not likely to jump up 
and down and say this boy has got to be called Charles and George.

'This isn't going to be "Granny, do you approve?" but more 'These are the names we've chosen - do you like them?'.

'It's much more of a personal thing these days.'

Despite their freer rein, it is unlikely that William
 and Kate would pick a name out of keeping with royal tradition, and 
they will be mindful of choosing a name that befits a future king or 
queen.

In the past, the approval of the sovereign has held great importance.

When the Duke and Duchess of York had
 their second daughter Princess Margaret Rose in 1930, they were 
planning to call her Ann Margaret, but changed their mind after learning
 that King George V disliked the name Ann.

Queen Victoria insisted that the name
 Albert be used as a middle name, if not a first, in honour of her 
beloved consort Prince Albert.

Royal babies' names are not usually 
revealed straight away and the public are often left guessing for 
several days as speculation mounts.

When Princess Beatrice was born in 1988, it was two weeks before her name was known.

When William arrived in 1982, his 
parents waited seven days before deciding upon and announcing his name. 
Diana was thought to have preferred names such as Sebastian and Oliver, 
while Charles was reportedly holding out for Albert.

Charles's own name, however, remained
 a mystery for an entire month and was only declared ahead of his 
christening in the Music Room of Buckingham Palace in December 1948. 

In a more modern approach, William and Kate could buck the trend and unveil their chosen name immediately.

Royal babies tend to be given a number of middle names.

The Prince of Wales has four names - 
Charles Philip Arthur George - while the Duke of Cambridge also has four
 - William Arthur Philip Louis.

The Queen has three names - Elizabeth Alexandra Mary - while William's mother Diana, Princess of Wales, was Diana Frances.

The Duchess of Cambridge has just two names, Catherine Elizabeth.

Prince Harry's first name is actually Henry, followed by Charles Albert David.

King Edward VIII, who abdicated the 
throne, had seven names - Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick 
David - but was always known to his family as David.

Queen Victoria was named Alexandrina Victoria and as a child was nicknamed Drina.

The baby will be styled HRH Prince [forename] of Cambridge.

When William was born he was Prince 
William of Wales and his children will use Cambridge in the same way.

According to the monarchy's official 
website: 'For the most part, members of the Royal Family who are 
entitled to the style and dignity of HRH Prince or Princess do not need a
 surname, but if at any time any of them do need a surname (such as upon
 marriage), that surname is Mountbatten-Windsor.'

Parents-to-be: The Duke of Cambridge is at his wife's side as she is in labour with their first child today

In 1917, George V adopted Windsor as the royal family's House and surname.

In 1960, for the direct descendants of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh who require a surname, it became Mountbatten-Windsor.

  'This is the biggest non-sporting event in our company's history'

      - Coral spokesman

Mountbatten was the surname Greek-born Prince Philip assumed when he became naturalised in 1947.

If a boy, the baby is also likely to 
one day be Prince of Wales when William accedes to the throne. The title
 is usually given to the male heir to the throne, but it is not 
automatic.

Bookies are already cashing in after due dates backed by the punters passed by without a baby.

The most popular day for due-date bets was last Thursday, July 18, when 1,142 people lost money with Ladbrokes alone.

One punter was down £1,000 after 
putting their money on July 17, and the company will make £23,000 after 
getting to midnight last night without a royal baby.  Meanwhile Coral 
says it has already made £25,000 from lost bets.

William Hill said it had already taken
 £100,000 in due date bets but could not say how many people had lost 
out as all bets remain open until the baby is born.
