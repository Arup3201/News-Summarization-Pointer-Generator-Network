A Brazilian circus performer has died after falling 35 feet on stage after an acrobatic stunt went horribly wrong in front of a live audience.

Video from the Circus Tihany Spectacular recorded the moment that Wilson Gomes Barreto, 28, missed his jump and plummeted to the ground during a high-flying maneuver called the Russian Litter.

The accident occurred in Londrina in southern Brazil - about 350 miles west of São Paulo.

Tragic: Wilson Gomes Barreto, 28, died two days after his fall. He was conscious after his horrific tumble and complained only of a broken elbow

The video shows two swinging carriages carrying acrobats higher and higher at the sides of the stage moments before the deadly accident.

Then, suddenly, Barreto can be seen falling onto the stage.

Medics rush over to help him and an entire medical crew surrounds him before the lights on stage are cut. 

Odiario.com reports that Barreto was conscious and only complained of a fractured elbow directly after the fall.

Additionally, a doctor from the local hospital was on hand and immediately attended to him.

However, he took a turn for the worse when his brain began to swell two days later.

He died of his injuries on May 19, said the Ringmaster of the circus.

He said the acrobat jumped from the wrong angle of the swinging carriage and missed his target.

Richard Massone, the producer of the circus, maintains that the act is safe. He said Barreto's death was the first serious accident in the history of the performance.
