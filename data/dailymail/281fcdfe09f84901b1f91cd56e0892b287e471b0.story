'Fire truck and ambulances were on the scene within minutes. I don't believe there are any survivors.'

The airport has been closed.

Nico Salvatore Enea, who is also at the airport but inside another plane, said via Twitter that his pilot told them that there are '100 percent fatalities'.

'Pilot says regional, most likely foreign, [but] cannot even get tail number from wreckage,' he posted on his account.

'Definitely wing engine explosion where fuel is kept.'

'High winds, bad angle,' he added, referring to the crash, which happened upon landing.
