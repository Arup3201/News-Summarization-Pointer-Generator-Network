Follow Sportsmail's coverage as Manchester United host Chelsea in the Barclays Under 21 Premier League. 

The Blues currently lead the way in the youth league, however Manchester United could take top spot with a victory by a two-goal margin at Leigh Sports Village.

Andy Kellett, a surprise transfer deadline day loan signing from Bolton, is on the Manchester United bench. It's a strong line-up from the hosts which includes keeper Victor Valdes and Ashley Young.

That's all from us tonight. Thanks for joining and be sure to return soon for more live coverage.

In terms of the table- Manchester United join Chelsea level on points to lead the Under 21 Premier League on 21 points along with Southampton (who were beaten by Everton tonight). So three at the helm thanks to United's dogged display.

That's it! Manchester United have defeated the Under 21 league leaders Chelsea thanks to an impressive second-half comeback.

Brown has a chance, a very tough one, to volley Chelsea back level but he can't keep his effort down as the Blues pour forward to equalise.

The magnificent Charly Musonda is taken off, with Olna Aina nearly providing an assist with his first touch- a sublime cross on the right, but it evades Solanke.

Christensen comes off for Dion Conroy as the Blues search for an equaliser

Nick Powell finds himself through on goal 12 yards out but he scuffs his shot and misses the chance to secure the three points

Pereira steps up and whips in a teasing cross. United captain Tom Thorpe rises unmarked to head the hosts into the lead.

James Weir has been a fine addition to the United midfield since coming on and he plays through Pereira who is hauled down on the run

We're set for a pulsating final 10 minutes as both sides seem determined to find a winner...

Tammy Abrahams replaces Kasey Palmer, who has had a decent outing for the Blues, linking up well with Brown in the Chelsea attack.

Pereira is at it again. The Brazilian curls in a superb long distance strike but Beeney manages to tip it around the post to keep the scores level. The equaliser has rejuvenated the hosts.

Rafael wins a freekick for the hosts and Andreas Pereira takes the honour. His effort deflects cruelly off Jay Dasilva in the Chelsea wall and flies into the net to level the match, wrong footing Mitchell Beeney.

Izzy Brown is in full flow now. The Blues forward jinks past three challenges before whipping in a fierce drive from the edge of the United box. Fortunately for the home side Valdes was ready to react and tip the shot around the post with a smart save.

Ashley Fletcher makes way for Donald Love (what a name)!

Nick Powell is handed a yellow card as Manchester United continue to struggle to dictate the game in the middle, relying upon last ditch tackles. 

Charly Musonda shows off some silky skills to back heel Kasey Palmer through on goal on the left hand side of the pitch but his effort is clawed away by Valdes

Ashley Young makes way for James Weir after an hour on the park. The England international managed to ride several rough tackles and improve his match fitness after five matches out with a hamstring injury. Was he taken off immediately after being culpable in the Chelsea opener?

The Blues have the lead! 1-0 to Chelsea. Ashley Young leaves Tyler Blackett under unnecessary pressure with a poor back pass and the lively Izzy Brown steals the ball off Blackett to find Dominic Solanke at the back post and tap in from a few yards.

Nick Powell is slashed down by Christensen on the edge of the Chelsea area but Ashley Young whips the resulting freekick well over the bar.

Six of the starting XI at Manchester United have played under first team manager Louis van Gaal this season. You'd think that would be enough quality to see off Chelsea this evening but the Blues are controlling the opening exchanges this half.

We're back under way. Chelsea have been beaten just twice this season. Let's see what United can do about that

Andy Kellett (centre, back row) is currently on the Manchester United bench. Remember the 21-year-old defender was plucked from the Bolton reserves on loan on transfer deadline day in a shock swoop by Louis van Gaal's side.

That's the half-time break at the Leigh Sports Village Stadium. It's been tense and well fought but very few clear chances to rave about

The referee is perhaps a bit trigger happy with the cards as Andreas Pereira enters the book. Charly Musonda uses his pace to skip past the United midfielder but the 19-year-old's challenge is mistimed and costs him a card.

It's Izzy Brown again. The England under 19 international rides two challenges and takes aim from 20 yards out on the right of the penalty area. His crisp strike goes wide but narrowly misses the United woodwork.

Well as soon as I speak there is a chance. Kasey Palmer capitalises on a poor United clearance to take fire from the edge of the box but his effort is comfortably saved by Victor Valdes.

The reason why you haven't heard much in terms of chances is due to the lack of width in the game. Both sides are determined to play down the middle but have thus far failed to find the intricate pass.

Ashley Young is on the deck again and it's nasty. Chelsea skipper Houghton is lucky not to pick up a second booking after his lunge on Young lands right on the winger's ankle. That must have hurt!

Well it's been a quiet night so far for Victor Valdes in the United goal but a couple of clearances have kept the 33-year-old on his toes

Izzy Brown is impressing with his link up play for the Blues but the majority of the play is in the middle of the park as both sides are struggling for momentum and penetration going forward

Jordan Houghton is the first in the book after the Blues captain takes down Young. The United winger is getting numerous hard hits from the Chelsea youngsters but this one was deemed a step too far. Liam Grimshaw then quickly follows into the book for a late challenge for United.

After quarter of an hour it's Chelsea who are dominating possession and managing to stretch the United defence

The away side win a corner and Andreas Christensen is presented with the game's best chance thus far. Tyler Blackett fails to deal with the Chelsea delivery and the ball falls to the Dane from eight yards out but he fires wide from a tight angle.

It's getting spicy already. Chelsea's Fankaty Dabo is clearly not intimidated coming up against an England international as he clatters into Ashley Young with the pair exchanging a few feisty words. 

Andreas Pereira swings in a smart ball for the hosts from the right but his cross evades the United frontline.

Rafael leaves Victor Valdes in the lurch with a miss-cued back pass, which the Spaniard can't prevent going for an early corner.

Chelsea lead the Under 21 Premier League but the hosts can top the table with a win of a two-goal margin or more
