Miss Bulford is already being tipped as the corporation¿s first female director-general

New BBC director-general Lord Hall has appointed a former colleague to a top post at the corporation on a £395,000 salary.

Channel 4 chief operating officer Anne Bulford has been handed the role of managing director of BBC finance and operations without the job being advertised.

Her appointment comes shortly after the new director-general announced that he had hired former Labour culture secretary James Purnell to be its strategy and digital chief on a £295,000-a-year salary.

Like Miss Bulford he was appointed without the role being advertised.

Lord Hall, chief executive of the Royal Opera House, formally takes up his BBC post in April. Before joining Channel 4 in 2005, Miss Bulford spent three years with the Royal Opera House as director of finance and business affairs.

Lord Hall knows her from their time together at the Royal Opera House and also from his time as deputy chairman at Channel 4.

Her appointment is bound to trigger fears of cronyism.

Miss Bulford had previously worked at the BBC as head of internal audit and then finance director of BBC Productions. She will replace the BBC’s outgoing chief financial officer, Zarin Patel.

In her new job, which begins in the summer, she will also take on some of the responsibilities of former chief operating officer Caroline Thomson, who left the BBC last year. Miss Bulford is already being tipped as the corporation’s first female director-general.

There was some disquiet within the BBC yesterday about how this and Mr Purnell’s appointment had happened without any formal job application process.

Tory MP John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons culture, media and sport select committee, said: ‘At a time when the BBC are saying they are having to cut back on programme budgets because of the squeeze on the licence fee, it is extraordinary that they think this is an appropriate amount to pay in public money to an individual, however good.

‘Secondly it demonstrates they are still completely out of touch with the world in which most people have to live today.’

In an email to staff, Lord Hall said Miss Bulford was a ‘direct appointment rather than an advertised one’ because he believed her talent and experience ‘make her the best person for this role’.

Her salary is not far off Lord Hall’s pay of £450,000 a year, but the BBC claimed it was a net saving of about £250,000 from the combined salaries of Miss Patel and Miss Thomson.

Miss Bulford’s salary at Channel 4 was £375,000 but she earned a total pay package of £456,000 there last year.

She said: ‘I am really looking forward to returning to the BBC. I have such great respect for the organisation.

‘I am also very pleased to be working with Tony [Lord Hall] once again.’
