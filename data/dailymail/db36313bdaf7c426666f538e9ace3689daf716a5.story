Jared Simpson has learned first-hand what it means to be between a rock and a hard place when he landed behind bars for allegedly trying to pay his bar tab with a pebble – and then threatening to blow up the bar.

Simpson, 23, of North Waterford, Maine, was taken into custody in Tallahassee February 18 on charges of making false bomb threats, petty theft and disorderly conduct.

According to investigators, the bizarre incident unfolded at around 4pm last Wednesday when Simpson tottered into the bar on crutches, ordered a Bud Light beer and then offered the bartender a rock to cover his $10 tab.

'Rainbow man': Jared Simpson, 23, a Maine resident and a self-proclaimed 'Rainbow Man,' has been arrested for allegedly threatening to blow up a Florida bar after trying to pay his $10 tab with a rock 

Simpson walked into 4th Quarter Bar and Grille in Tallahassee Wednesday afternoon on crutches, telling a fellow patron he was 'shot up in the war.' He later left and then returned carrying a suspicious briefcase

When the staffer rejected the pebble as an acceptable method of payment, the 23-year-old Mainer tossed a torn dollar bill at a female employee and said he would pay her 'in other ways,' according to a probable cause affidavit cited by the Huffington Post.

In the course of his stay at the Monroe Street bar, Mr Simpson reportedly boasted to another patron, that he was 'shot up in the war.'

But when his new acquaintance, who turned out to be a veteran, inquired which military branch he had served in, the 23-year-old replied, 'if I tell you, I have to kill you,' the court documents stated.

After Simpson's rock-for-beer barter failed, the suspect allegedly left the bar without the aid of crutches, and then returned carrying a credit card that did not work.

Simpson then left the bar again, only to return later dressed in a grey suit and carrying a briefcase. One eyewitness later told police he overheard Simpson ‘speaking in tongues.’

The situation took an unexpected turn when Jared Simpson placed his briefcase on a booth table, opened it, then closed and locked it before backing away from the bag while holding a cellphone and a beeper in his hands.

The 23-year-old man warned everyone in the bar, 'Anyone touch this, they will die,' according to the affidavit.

Fearing that the briefcase contained an explosive device, bar staff and patrons immediately fled the premises. Once outside, Simpson was observed doing a handstand near El Jalisco’s Mexican Restaurant on North Monroe Street.

Bizarre behavior: The 23-year-old landscaper was overheard 'speaking in tongues' and singing a song to a police officer about how he was a 'rainbow man'  

A police officer who responded to the scene approached Simpson and asked him what was inside the briefcase left in the bar.

According to the affidavit, Simpson replied with a smile, 'maybe a bomb or a baby.' He then broke into an improvised song about how he was a 'rainbow man' and how he will not comply with law enforcement’s requests.

In response to the officer's repeated questions about the bag, the 23-year-old suspect stated: 'I am my own master, I answer to myself; no police have the right to ask questions.'

A bomb squad that was called to the scene examined Simpson's briefcase and vehicle, and determined that neither contained explosives.

Once Simpson was placed in the back of a patrol car to be transported to jail, he managed to remove three screws from his handcuffs and free his arms from behind his back.

According to his Facebook page, Simpson, who goes by the nickname 'The Geek', studied computer IT at Central Maine Community College and has been working in landscaping and snow removal.

Over the past week, Simpson has unleashed a torrent of bizarre posts on his wall about his misadventures in Alabama and Tallahassee, interspersed with desperate pleas for cash after claiming his car and phone had been stolen.

Simpson shared with his friends how one time he snuck into a Best Western to use a computer, how he performed an impromptu duet with a piano player at an exclusive Florida hotel, and how he celebrated Valentine’s Day by having sex with a girl he met at Wendy's after he bought her a frosty.

When asked by one of his concerned friends what he was on, Simpson replied: 'drugs...and hugs.'

Simpson reportedly said he arrived in Tallahassee to party with the 'Rainbow People' in the Apalachicola National Forest, reported Tallahassee.com.

The 23-year-old also ranted on his social media account about police officers, repeatedly referring to them as ‘pigs.’

Simpson’s bond has been set at $30,500, but the station WCTV reported that a judge has ordered the Maine resident to undergo a psychiatric evaluation before he is eligible to bail out.
