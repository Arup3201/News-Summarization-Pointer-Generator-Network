A New Jersey suburb was the scene of a second shooting murder, less than 24 hours after three men died and two were wounded in a nightclub slaying.

Two teens were killed and one youth was wounded on Christmas Day night in a shooting in the city's South Ward.

A 13-year-old girl and 14-year-old boy were fatally shot in an apparent double homicide.

University Hospital in Newark where the victims were taken

The shooting took place not far from Route 78 and the Irvington border police say.

The unidentified teens were both pronounced dead at University Hospital in Newark.

A third young victim is in critical but stable condition.

Visibly distraught, about a dozen family members and friends gathered in the hospital seeking information on the third victim near the trauma centre's emergency room.

The hospital also received victims of a Christmas Eve shooting at a bar that left three men dead and two others wounded.

Authorities say the shooting occurred at about 12:45 a.m. Wednesday at Slick's Go Go Bar in Irvington at Nye Avenue and 21st street.Â 

The shooting occurred outside Sick Rick's go go in New Jersey

Slick's is located in an industrial area a few blocks from the Garden State Parkway.

A witness tells WABC-TV in New York that shots erupted after a fight broke out on the steps of the club. He says about 100 people were at Slick's at the time.

NJ.com reports that police say two or more suspects were trying to enter the nightclub and that the bouncer denied entry because he found a gun on one of the suspects after patting him down.

After the bouncer discovered the gun, the suspect stepped back and shot the bouncer. The bouncer died of his injuries.

The shooter then shot and killed a man who was related to Slick's owner.

The third man who died was thought to somehow be related to the suspects but it is unclear as to whether or not he was shot by security or accidentally by another party.

Initial reports indicated that police were looking for a grey sedan that fled the scene. No arrests were immediately announced.

The names of the men who were killed haven't been released, nor has the condition of the two who were wounded.

The two wounded at the scene were rushed to University Hospital in Newark.

According to NJ.com Slick's was hosting a theme party called 'Sluddie Tuesday.' There have been a few shootings at Slick's in the past few years including one shooting in 2010 that left one man dead.

The shooting is currently under investigation by Acting Essex County Prosecutor Carolyn Murray and Irvington Police Director Joseph Santiago said the Irvington Police and the Essex County Prosecutor's Office Homicide/Major Crimes Task Force.
