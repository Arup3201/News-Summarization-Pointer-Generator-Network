A top QC has lost a costly legal battle over the sale of a £3.6million country manor after pulling out of the deal when he discovered the property was riddled with dry rot and rising damp.

Leading barrister William Griffiths QC and his wife Angela thought they had found their dream home when they viewed Laughton Manor in Lewes, East Sussex, in 2010.

They exchanged contracts with owner Alan Hardy on April Fools' Day in 2011 but were hauled before the courts after refusing to pay for the property because they were concerned about rising damp, wet and dry rot and timber decay.

They have now lost a lengthy legal battle in London's High Court and face a £385,000 bill after a judge ruled they had breached the contract by trying to rescind the agreement.

Mr and Mrs Griffiths had originally agreed to buy Laughton Manor, in East Sussex (pictured), for £3.6million, but later pulled out after receiving the results of a survey which said it was 'riddled with damp and dry rot'

The issue began when Mr Griffiths, 66, an 'eminent' planning and property lawyer, and his wife exchanged contracts on the multi-million pound property with bricklaying tycoon Mr Hardy, 56, before seeking any professional advice on the mansion's condition.

A survey later revealed evidence of penetrating and rising damp, as well as wet and dry rot and signs of timber decay, the High Court heard.

In light of the survey, Mr and Mrs Griffiths, who had wanted a home in 'pristine' condition, refused to stump up the balance of a 10 per cent deposit.

However, Mr Hardy and his wife, Juliet, responded by tearing up the contract and refusing to refund the £150,000 deposit the Griffiths had already paid.

The couples ended up in court where Judge Amanda Tipples QC today handed a resounding victory to Mr and Mrs Hardy.

The Griffiths not only forfeited their £150,000 deposit, but were ordered to pay Mr and Mrs Hardy £235,000 damages for breach of contract.

In a final blow to the QC, Judge Tipples found that Mr Griffiths made a better advocate than a witness.

Having appeared on his feet in court countless times, the barrister 'found it difficult to simply answer the question put'. 

He 'could not resist arguing his case' from the witness box, the judge said, before adding: 'I prefer the evidence of Mr Hardy to that of Mr Griffiths'.

Mr Griffiths earlier told the court that he 'tended to leave these things to his wife'.

However, he agreed that he was 'much keener' on Laughton Manor than she was.

The couple insisted in court that they had been the victims of 'reckless misrepresentation'.

They claimed devout church-goer Mr Hardy and his 55-year-old wife had gravely misled them about the mansion's condition.

They also complained that Mr and Mrs Hardy had made 'excessive and unreasonable demands'.

The couple also said they had discovered to their 'horror' that a small but 'extremely significant' plot of land had been sold off from the grounds.

However, Judge Tipples accepted Mr Hardy's 'careful' evidence that he had never had the house surveyed and was unaware of any damp problem.

Exonerating the Hardys, the judge said they had an 'unconditional right' to cancel the contract when Mr and Mrs Griffiths failed to pay the balance of the deposit or complete on time.

The Hardys were entitled to pocket the deposit, to re-sell the mansion to someone else and to sue the Griffiths for damages, she ruled. 

The house was on the market for £4.5million and Mr and Mrs Griffiths had agreed to buy it for £3.6million

A surveyor's report indicated that there was 'extensive rising damp, dry rot and timber decay' in the property

Laughton Manor was originally built between 1760 and 1780 although it is unknown how much of the original building remains.

It was bought by Sir James Duke Bart, a Lord Mayor and Sheriff of London in the 1840s.

He was a close friend of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert and admired their summer residence of Osborne House, which also has a similar Italian style tower to Laughton Manor.

The Duke's family lived in the property for more than 70 years and it was sold in 1911 to a private buyer.

In 1930 it was bought by the Ministry of Health, who used it as an office until the 1990s.

It was then bought over and restored to its former glory by a private owner.

Jonathan Seitler QC, for Mr and Mrs Hardy, earlier pointed out that the contract contained a 'common' clause used in conveyancing, whereby the QC and his wife agreed to accept and pay for the property based on its state of repair at the time of signing.

They had viewed the property several times, once with an architect, but had signed the contract on April 1, 2011, the day after agreeing the £3.6million price.

They had done so without first obtaining a survey report, which did not arrive until a month later, the court heard.

Mr Seitler added: 'The vendor is a lay person in matters of law...the purchaser is an eminent QC with property expertise.

'The property was accepted in the physical state it was in at the time of contract and you can't go back on that.

'If it is damp, it is accepted with damp'.

The 30-room mansion is set in 12 acres of countryside and its architecture has been compared to that of Queen Victoria's much-loved summer home, Osborne House on the Isle of Wight.

It was built by Queen Victoria's friend, Sir James Duke Bart, in the mid-19th Century. 

It is believed that Laughton Manor has since been sold to another purchaser for the same £3.6million price tag.

Mr Hardy now lives in Lewes with his wife, manages a church, and has business interests valued at £17m.
