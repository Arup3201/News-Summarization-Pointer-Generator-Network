The picturesque Outer Hebridean island that Bonnie Prince Charlie used as a hideaway after his defeat at Culloden has been put up for sale for £500,000.

And Barra and Vatersay - also in the island chain - may also be about to be taken over by locals. 

Wiay, which lies off the coast of South Uist, boasts the cave in which the leader of the 1745 Jacobite rebellion concealed himself for several days while being sought by British government forces.

The island has been uninhabited for over a century, although the current owners - the Chettle family from England, who bought it in 2003 - used it for holidays and summer camping. But the new owners will not have to make do with life underground or under canvas.

A ruined croft, which was once home to ten islanders, has planning permission for a new home that will provide spectacular views of the island's surroundings.

Mark Mitchell, head of selling agents Bell Ingram, said: 'An area of land with as much history and beauty as the Island of Wiay does not come up on the market very often.

'It has a fantastic back story, once being the hidey-hole for Bonnie Prince Charlie, which is paralleled by the stunning views of the surrounding Benbecula and South Uist islands, making it the ideal location for those looking to totally escape the rat race.'

The 970-acre island also has sporting rights, and in recent years the land has been used for woodcock and duck shooting. There is also red deer stalking and fishing.

Located half a mile south-east of Benbecula, Wiay is accessed by private boat from Petersport to a sheltered bay close to the ruined cottage on the west side of the island.

The island is predominately heather clad, with a small number of freshwater lochs, rising to 335ft at Beinn a'Tuath. But it is best known for playing its part in the escape of the prince following the defeat of his Jacobite forces at Culloden in 1746.

In 1745, Charles travelled to the Highlands to raise the Scottish clans in rebellion against the current British monarch - King George II, of the house of Hanover.

His plan was to make his father James Stuart, the 'Old Pretender', king.

But after Culloden, he fled west and was transported to the Outer Hebrides by boat in an eight-hour voyage in atrocious conditions. He eventually sought shelter in a cave on Wiay, now known as 'Prince Charlie's Rest', while his followers kept watch for the British navy. He was brought fresh clothing and it appears this was the first time the prince wore Highland dress.

Prince Charles spent the next few weeks in hiding, employing several disguises. He lived like a commoner and ate drammach, a type of oatmeal mixed raw with seawater.

The prince eventually obtained passage to France and escaped, pledging to his remaining followers that he would return with an army.

Wiay has since slipped back into obscurity. One former resident, William Buie, left the island in 1825 to become a banker in Canada. Although the island was logged as having six inhabitants in 1861, it was deserted by the turn of the 20th century.

Meanwhile a series of meetings are taking place on Barra and Vatersay this week for islanders to consider a takeover, which would include all fishing and mineral rights on the 16,000-acre isles.

Barra are Vatersay, which are linked by a causeway and have around 1300 inhabitants, are currently under the ownership of the Scottish Government's agriculture department, as a result of a long-standing historical arrangement and after additional land was handed to it in 2003 by former laird Iain MacNeill.

Part of the deal by Mr MacNeill, whose family lines go back more than 1000 years on Barra, was that the estate should be given to islanders free of charge should they decide to vote for ownershup.Residents are now to attend public meetings to investigate whether they want to take this step.

They will not only discuss the 9,000 acres donated by Mr MacNeill, who died two years ago, but also the possibility of taking over the remainder of Barra and Vatersay, which has over 400 crofts.

This has been under the control of the agircultural department through an historical legacy of the Land Reform uprising a century ago.

The debates have been organised by Coimhearsnachd Bharraidh agus Bhatarsaidh - Barra and Vatersay Community.

A spokesman for the community-owned company aimed at the future development of the islands, said: 'The whole purpose of the meetings is basically testing the temperature of the water, and seeing what the feeling is locally.

'It is for the community toconsider the pros and cons of a community buyout. This is an important step in the potential development of a land buyout.

'This is a pre-feasability to see what the local mood and perception is.'

Local councillor Donald Manford said: 'I am sure the islanders want to take control of their own affairs, although there will still have to be a vote to decide.'

Three guest speakers are helping inform the debate and gather local reaction.

These include David Cameron, chair of Community Land Scotland which helps support small rural communities in considering taking ownership of public land.

Also taking part is Murdo MacKay, director of the West Harris Trust which recently won a Lottery grant of £380,000 to help kick start a process of allowing their community to manage their own affairs as they develop plans for affordable housing, a hydro-electric scheme and other economic development projects.

Helen MacDougall of HIE Community Assets Branch is also speaking about how they assist communities in the preparation for a bid and offers start-up advice.

A community buyout of Barra and Vatersay would be the latest in a long succession throughout the Highlands and Islands.

Only last month, residents on the small island of Scalpay, off Harris, voted to take over the running of their own affairs.
