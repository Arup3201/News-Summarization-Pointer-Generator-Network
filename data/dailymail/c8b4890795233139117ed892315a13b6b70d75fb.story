Slumped on her knees in the freezing cold snow and unable to contain her grief, a devastated Ukrainian woman weeps beside the body of her father after he was killed by a stray shell.

Vladimir Churilov, aged 58, had been returning home with his wife after they went to pick up their pensions when the shells landed in the city of Donetsk, spraying them with shrapnel.

But while his wife was injured and taken to hospital, the man was killed and his body left bleeding in the snow.

Galina Bayeva is slumped on her knees in the snow as she and her son cry over the body of her father Vladimir Churilov, who was killed by a stray shell in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine 

Mr Churilov was sprayed the shrapnel from the shell as he and his wife were returning home from collecting their pension. His wife was injured and is being treated in hospital 

Mrs Bayeva is unable to contain her grief after the death of her father as her son also holds his head in is hands, while her husband speaks on his mobile phone 

The man was discovered by his daughter Galina Bayeva who fell to the floor on seeing her father slumped on the ground and covered her mouth with her hands as she began to cry.

Her son was also clearly devastated by the discovery of his grandfather and could also be seen holding his hands to his face while her husband made a call on his mobile phone.

Mrs Bayeva said: 'Dad's been killed. Mum's in hospital. They didn't make it home. They'd gone to get their pensions.

'Dad is lying here. He's full of holes, full of sharpnel.'

Clashes in east Ukraine, where Russian-backed separatist rebels are fighting Kiev government troops, have continued despite the signing of a ceasefire three months ago, and the death toll has risen to more than 4,300 since mid-April.

Despite a ceasefire being agreed three months ago, shelling has continued in Donetsk with many houses, such as the one pictured, being damaged on the attacks 

The prolonged fighting in Ukraine has also destroyed infrastructure and homes in the east of the country, with many fearing the oncoming winter

The prolonged fighting has destroyed infrastructure and homes in the east of the country, leaving many residents without warmth or safe shelter for the winter.

Galina Zarubina's house, a street away from where the couple were attacked, was also damaged in today's shelling.

She said: 'I can't stand it. How do I live? No bread, no money. Somebody - save us.'

Meanwhile in Kiev, the army said six soldiers had been killed and 14 wounded in the past 24 hours in clashes with separatists.

Spokesman Andriy Lysenko explained separatist forces had also suffered 'big losses' in three concerted attempts to break through Ukrainian positions, including at the international airport in the rebel-controlled city of Donetsk, but had been beaten back.

Ukrainian and separatist leaders have officially said they will observe a supplementary truce on an agreed 'Day of Silence' on Tuesday to prepare the way for creation of a non-militarised buffer zone.

But it is far from clear if the latest of many peace efforts will succeed.

It comes as Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov criticised Western nations today for constantly attempting to blame his country for the crisis in Ukraine.

Mr Lavrov reiterated Moscow's calls for Kiev to hold direct talks with pro-Russian rebels fighting government troops in eastern Ukraine, saying it 'makes no sense' to seek ways out of the conflict without the separatists' involvement.

He said: 'Our Western colleagues, some European countries but Americans first and foremost ... if they want to try to present us as the main culprits, which is what they are constantly doing ... this is not right, this won't work.'

The West says Russia provides arms and troops to the rebels to destabilise Ukraine and stall its drive towards mainstream Europe. Moscow denies being part of the armed conflict.

He also called on Kiev's Western backers, including France and Germany, to press Ukraine to carry out constitutional reform, which Moscow has said must give the Russian-speaking eastern regions wide autonomy.

Meanwhile French president Francois Hollande urged Russian leader Vladimir Putin to look to the future rather than the past to help ease tensions in Ukraine.

In a policy speech yesterday, Mr Putin evoked the lessons of history to shift the blame for many of Russia's problems on to the West, accusing 'enemies of yesterday' of trying to bring a new Iron Curtain down around Russia.

But today Mr Hollande said: 'As for the declaration by Mr Putin, who went back to the past in his speech, we should concentrate on the future - while not forgetting the lessons of the past.

'The tension, the pressure at the moment can in no way serve as a solution to problems,' he added, suggesting that he, Mr Putin, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and German Chancellor Angela Merkel should 'start the process of reducing tension' together.
