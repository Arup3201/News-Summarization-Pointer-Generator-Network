Chef Henry Stangroom, 21, who was stabbed to death in his flat in south London last year

A jilted lover was found with a harpoon stuck in his own head after stabbing his ex-girlfriend's brother to death in revenge for her leaving him, it has been claimed.

Andrew Morris, 30, knifed Henry Stangroom, 21, in the heart at their flat in Battersea, south London, a court heard. 

Police found Morris with slit wrists and the harpoon sticking out from underneath his chin in the bedroom of the flat.

The chef, who worked at the Criterion in Piccadilly Circus, had suffered stab wounds to the heart, lungs and head. 

Opening the case, prosecutor Sarah Plaschkes QC said: ‘On the October 17 of last year, police officers found Henry’s lifeless body laying on his bed at Lavender Sweep, Battersea. 

‘He had sustained a fatal stab wound to his heart and lungs and had a second wound to his head. 

‘The defendant was discovered in the bathroom with wounds to both wrists and a harpoon spear stuck out from underneath his chin. 

‘The defendant was taken to hospital where his wounds were treated. 

‘There were only two people in the flat, the front door was locked and the keys were on the inside of the door,’ she said. 

When Morris was arrested he claimed the last thing he could remember was seeing his ex-girlfriend Michelle three days previously.

‘There is going to be no dispute in this case that the defendant inflicted the fatal wound, nor is it going to be in dispute that the defendant cut his own wrists and was responsible for the spear underneath his neck,’ said Ms Plaschkes.

‘It is the Crown’s case that this defendant killed Henry in revenge for Michelle leaving him - rejecting him,’ said Ms Plaschkes.

Michelle had ended the relationship around six weeks before Morris attacked her brother, the court heard. 

Morris had a history of violent and aggressive behaviour towards his ex girlfriends and had punched partner Ruth Owens in the stomach and spat in her face, it was said.

‘He destroyed a canvas painting and a ring, which had been given by her grandmother, he threw into the river. 

'He took revenge on her by destroying things that were precious to her,’ said Ms Plaschkes. 

Morris began his relationship with Ms Stangroom just a few weeks before his girlfriend at the time gave birth to their son. 

‘At the end of August, about the 28, the defendant and Michelle had an argument during the course of which the defendant smashed a plate against the wall and was violent towards Michelle, grabbing her shoulders, throwing her onto the sofa and forcibly holding both her hands over he mouth,’ Ms Plaschkes said.

When she decided to end the relationship he killed her brother in revenge, it is claimed.

Morris, of Lavendar Sweep, Battersea, southwest London, denies murder. 

The trial continues.
