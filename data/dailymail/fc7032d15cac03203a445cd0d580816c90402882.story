A young boy with psychiatric problems is locked in a cage every day to stop him destroying things and beating up his sister while his father goes out to work.

Xiao Wang, 12 years old, was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Cortical Dysplasia - a congenital abnormality which causes seizures.

His single father, Zhong Kefu, 45, began locking him up after becoming worried by his violent behaviour,following complaints from neighbours.

His father,  Zhong Kefu, 45 (centre) says he has to keep his son in the cage so he can go out to work to pay for food, and for medical treatment. Xiao has destroyed neighbours' property before, including smashing up an old lady's cooking pot, and is violent towards his six-year-old sister (left)

In the past his son has taken neighbours' cloths, shoes and cell phones and thrown them in the village paddy fields, and smashed an old lady's cooking pot, That's magazine reports.

For months now, Xiao has been made to sit in the metal cage measuring 2 square meters (21 square feet) with nothing but a wooden stool, a urinal and some sponges inside.

Mr Zhong says he must keep his son in a cage so he can go out to work and earn enough money to pay for his treatment.

Mr Zhong said: 'When he was younger he ate anything he picked up, whether it was edible or not.

'Then he started destroying things, smashing them to pieces.

'Neighbours started getting angry because he was destroying their property and being violent with other children.

'He was also breaking things at home.'

Mr Zhong' s wife, who was mentally disabled, gave birth to Xiao  in 2002.

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness.

It can occur in people of any intellectual ability but many people with ADHD also have learning difficulties.

Symptoms of ADHD tend to be first noticed at an early age, and may become more noticeable as a child grows up. 

Many children with ADHD also must have conduct disorder –  involving a tendency towards highly antisocial behaviour, such as stealing, fighting, vandalism and harming people or animals.

In half of children, there is also a tendency towards oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) – which is defined by negative and disruptive behaviour, particularly towards authority figures, such as parents and teachers.

Studies have shown children with ADHD have 25 times the risk of being institutionalised for delinquency and nine times the risk of being sent to prison.

His parents noticed he behaved different from other children of the same age, and his only words were 'dad' or 'baba', and as he grew his behaviour became increasingly challenging.

He became violent with other children, including his sister, who is now six years old.

Mr Zhong and his wife were only allowed to have a second child – something normally forbidden under the Chinese government's one-child policy – because of Xiao's condition.

At first, Mr Zhong tied his son up and left him while he went to work in the village of Taoshu in Xiushui county in southern China's Jiangxi province.

But when he got home he always found Xiao's wrists were red raw from struggling to get free.

He tried locking him in his bedroom, but Xiao smashed the window one night and escaped, causing damage in the local neighborhood.

Mr Zhong said: 'I would like him to be able to go to school, to get an education and play with other children.

'But no school will accept him. He has a six-year-old sister, but is always violent with her as well.

'I need to make money to support my family and to get him treatment.

'But the only thing I can do at the moment is keep him in the cage until I have raised enough.'

For months now Xiao has been made to sit in the metal cage measuring 2 square meters (21 square feet) with nothing but a wooden stool, a urinal and some sponges inside.

Mr Zhong is far from proud of his solution, according to That's magazine.

'I can't bear to treat him this way but the schools won't take him, and if I don't go out and work we'll starve,' it reported.

A spokesman from the Jiangxi Children's Hospital where Xiao was diagnosed said: 'Unless he gets proper therapy soon he will stay this way for life.'
