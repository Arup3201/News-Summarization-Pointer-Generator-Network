A woman who was propelled to fame by a secretly-filmed video of her dancing at a bus stop has been offered a part in a professional stage show.

Secretary Ellie Cole, 35, went viral in April after being filmed busting moves while waiting for a bus in Eastleigh, Hampshire.

The video - named 'Eastleigh's Got Talent' - was set to Abba's Dancing Queen - and proved to be Miss Cole's ticket to stardom.

Ellie Cole, 35, had no idea she was being filmed while she bopped away waiting for her bus

But she went viral after thousands took a liking to her impromptu routine

She has been invited to take part in AH Men, a play showing at The Point Theatre in Eastleigh tonight.

She was given the role after Lynne Paris, who wrote the play, which has been performed on the West End stage, after the writer saw her video by chance.

Miss Cole studied performing arts for a year at Eastleigh College, but had to drop out after she lost her job and could not afford the fees.

She said this was a chance to fulfill her stage ambitions after attending rehearsals in London, adding: 'It's very flattering and humbling.

'There's no doubt it's very exciting.'

Ms Paris, who is also directing AH Men, said she spotted the video online and resolved to track Miss Cole down after learning she was from Hampshire.

She said: 'My son saw the video and he said "you've got to see this mum, she's just like you".

'Wherever I am, if there's music I find myself jigging along to it.

'I think anybody who likes music could identify with it.'

Miss Cole got her lucky break after Lynne Paris, a playwright and director, found her video and offered her a part in her play AH Men

Miss Cole said she is thrilled to be offered a professional role, as she had previously been forced to drop out of performing arts college

She also caused a sensation at the Mardi Gras parade in Eastleigh this weekend

Miss Cole, who lives in Southampton, will feature in the chorus line in the first act, and performs a group singing and dancing number.

She also performed with other cast members in an extract from the show as the finale to the Eastleigh Mardi Gras procession yesterday.

Miss Cole said: 'I'm just a normal everyday person who happens to like dancing at bus stops.

'Still to this day I find it hard to believe what happened with the video.

'It's like "wow, why me?".'

Miss Cole's exploits were first captured and uploaded to the internet by Nigel Baker and Jane Rowl (pictured)

After the video went viral it emerged that Miss Cole was actually dancing to Knock Down by Alesha Dixon, rather than the Abba track overlaid in the video.

Miss Dixon, 34, then heaped praise on Miss Coles moves on her own Twitter page, telling her 547,000 followers: 'Brilliant! So funny!'

Jane Rowland, 45, who filmed the routine from her cafe opposite the bus stop, said:

'She is an inspiration to us all and has cheered everyone up.'
