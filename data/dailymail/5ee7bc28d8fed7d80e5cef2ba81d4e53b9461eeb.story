Iranian military leaders have unveiled a new long-range drone capable of reaching Israel and most of the Middle East months after capturing a U.S. one.

General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, a senior Revolutionary Guard commander, described the weapon as a key strategic addition to Iran's military capabilities.

Hajizadeh,
who heads the Guard's aerospace division, said the Shahed-129, or 
Witness-129, has a range of 2,000 kilometres (1,250 miles) and can carry out reconnaissance missions or be armed with 
'bombs and missiles'.

Flexing its muscles: Military leaders say the unmanned aircraft has range of 2,000km and is capable to carrying bombs or missiles

That
covers much of the Middle East including Israel and nearly doubles the 
range of previous drones produced by Iranian technicians, who have often
relied on reverse engineering military hardware with the country under 
Western embargoes.

But 
it's unclear whether the new drone contains any elements of an unmanned 
CIA aircraft that went down in eastern Iran in December.

Iran said it has recovered data from the RQ-170 Sentinel and claimed it was building its own replica.

Iran
frequently makes announcements about its strides in military 
technology, but it is virtually impossible to independently determine 
the actual capabilities or combat worthiness of the weapons Iran is 
producing.

Tehran also 
test-fired four anti-ship missiles yesterday in a prelude to upcoming 
naval war games planned in an apparent response to U.S.-led warship 
drills in the Persian Gulf.

The show of Iranian military readiness
came as President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad prepared to address the U.N. 
General Assembly today amid a deepening impasse with the West over 
Tehran's disputed nuclear program.

Ahmadinejad
on Monday held open hope for renewed dialogue with the United States, 
but told reporters in New York that Iran was 'fully ready' to defend 
itself from attacks.

In
Tehran, a senior Revolutionary Guard commander, Gen. Amir Ali 
Hajizadeh, also warned that U.S. bases in the Gulf could face 
retaliatory strikes if Israel attacks Iran's nuclear sites.

Valuable technology: The RQ-170 was reportedly used to watch former Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden during the Navy SEAL mission that killed him

The
West and its allies fear Iran's uranium enrichment program could lead 
to atomic weapons, but the U.S. and others favor a mix of sanctions and 
diplomacy to try to force Tehran to curb its nuclear program. Iran 
claims it only seeks nuclear power for energy and medical applications.

Near the strategic Strait of Hormuz at 
the mouth of the Gulf, Iran test-fired four missiles it claimed could 
sink a 'big target' such as a warship in 50 seconds, Gen. Ali Fadavi of 
the powerful Revolutionary Guard was quoted as saying by the 
semi-official Fars news agency.

The Fars report late Monday was the first
indication of an Iranian military exercise taking place at the same 
time as the U.S.-led naval maneuvres in the Persian Gulf, including 
mine-sweeping drills, which got under way last week.

The U.S. Navy claims the maneuvers are not directly aimed at Iran, but the West and its regional allies have made clear they would react against attempts by Tehran to carry out threats to try to close critical Gulf oil shipping lanes in retaliation for tighter sanctions over its disputed nuclear programme.

Fadavi did not elaborate on the ongoing Iranian exercise or the type of missiles fired, but said the Guard is planning a 'massive naval maneuvre in the near future' in the strait, which is the route for one-fifth of the world's crude oil.

Iran regularly holds maneuvres to upgrade its military readiness as well as test its equipment.
