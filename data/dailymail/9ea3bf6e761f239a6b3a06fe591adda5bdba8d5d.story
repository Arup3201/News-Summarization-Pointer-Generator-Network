While this  Asian black bear in southwest Russia won't have seen Disney's The Jungle Book or read Rudyard Kipling's source material, it shows it has the dancing skills to match the story's star Baloo.

The breed dubbed the ursine species' 'most bizarre' by Kipling appears to throw shapes  with an unsuspecting birch tree as its partner in footage taken with hidden cameras in a wildlife reserve. 

In reality, it's more likely the majestic creature with the distinctive white marking on its chest is marking its territory and simply having a good old scratch of its hard to reach places, but the resemblance to Mowgli's mate is uncanny. 

And while it's believed Baloo's character is based more on the sloth bear found in India, the preacher of the Law of the Jungle's diet of 'only roots and nuts and honey' is more consistent with this very Asian black bear.

The footage released on Friday was shot back in November with a camera placed for research purposes at Land of the Leopard national park in Vladivostok.

This black bear, a species also known as moon bears due to the crescent shape of its making or the more obvious white-chested bear, rubs its back up and down the birch without a care. 

Despite this adorable footage, the breed is said to be rather dangerous to humans and despite being herbivorous is prone to unprovoked attacks.

Male black bears survey large territories that are said to be up to 80 square miles and are renowned for protecting their turf voraciously.

Baloo from Disney classic The Jungle Book also loves to dance and have a scratch against a tree

This one appears quite relaxed though in a video that has made it an internet sensation. 

It was caught on cameras placed by scientists at the Land of the Leopard park in the Primorsky Krai region. 

Research for the scientists centres mostly on the local Amur leopard population which, with as few as 45 adults left in the wild, is a contender to be the rarest of the big cats.

The Asian black bear can be found in the Himalayas, Korea, the north of India, China, Japan, Taiwan and, as in this case, the far east of Russia.

The species is classified as 'Vulnerable' by the International Union for Conservation of Nature due to hunting for its body parts and the impact of deforestation taking away its natural habitat. 

However, the Russian government has done them a favour in declaring the 1,000 square mile Land of the Leopard a protected reserve in 2012 in a bid to protect both the Amur leopards and Amur tigers.
