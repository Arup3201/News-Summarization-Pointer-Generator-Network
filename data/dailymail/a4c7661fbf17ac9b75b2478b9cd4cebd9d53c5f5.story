Breakthrough: A murder investigation has been opened into the 'overdose' death of a British charity worker Denyse Sweeney in India two years ago - after an inquest in the UK ruled she had no drugs in her system

A murder investigation has been opened into the 'overdose' death of a British charity worker in India two years ago - after an inquest in the UK ruled she had no drugs in her system.

Denyse Sweeney, a mother-of-two from Derby, died in hospital after collapsing in a bar in Anjuna, Goa, in April 2010.

Local officials said the 34-year-old passed away after bingeing on illegal drugs.

But an inquest at Derby Coroner's Court in April was told that no illegal substances were found in her system.

It
 was also revealed that she had 20 bruises on her body at the time of 
death, including one measuring 4.5cm on the back of her skull.

Pathologist
 Dr Ivan Robinson was unable to give a cause of death and coroner Dr 
Robert Hunter said the unexplained injuries 'were not investigated to 
any satisfactory level' by the authorities in Goa.

Returning
 an open verdict on her death, Derby and South Derbyshire coroner Dr 
Hunter said: 'There are a number of unexplained injuries but it is not 
clear how they were caused.

'It is clear they came about from a sort of trauma but whether violence was involved we cannot be sure.'

That ruling reinvigorated a campaign by Miss Sweeney's relatives for Indian police to open a murder investigation.

Last night, the news finally came through that police in Goa are now looking into the case.

The
 Times Of India today reported: 'The Anjuna police will now investigate 
the case of a British woman who died mysteriously in April 2010 as 
murder.'

Indian officials were moved to act after family members travelled to the Foreign Office in London.

Miss Sweeney's sister Maureen, 43, of
 Derby, said: 'This morning I woke up and instead of the first thought 
being a sad thought about Denyse it was a positive one that perhaps now 
we will get answers.'

Every day for the last two years, 
Maureen and another sister Marion have written letters and made phone 
calls to Goa, to the Foreign Office, to MPs and ministers, trying to 
prompt a murder investigation.

Now they are waiting to hear from Foreign Secretary William Hague. A letter is said to be on its way.

Derby South MP Margaret Beckett, who met with the family, used her contacts to help them.

The former Foreign Secretary said: 
'I'm very pleased to hear the news the family have had. I used my 
experience and contacts to raise the issues with the Government of Goa 
to get the investigation reopened.'

An inquest in Derby heard how toxicology samples taken from her body at the time of her death were only analysed 20 months later following pressure from the Foreign Office

Miss Sweeney leaves behind her son Ben Sweeney, now 18, and daughter Chloe Munro, 13.

She was on her second trip to Goa, 
enjoying an extended holiday and also working as a volunteer at an 
animal sanctuary, when she died in April 2010.

She was admitted to St Anthony Hospital in Anjuna, Goa, in a comatose state.

The doctor who treated her had been told she had 'most probably' had a drug overdose.

Friends and family organised fund-raising events to pay for her body to be flown back to Derby.

When it did arrive, a second 
post-mortem examination was carried out despite more than two-thirds of 
Miss Sweeney's brain having been removed by Indian doctors.

April's inquest heard how toxicology 
samples taken from her body at the time of her death were only analysed 
20 months later following pressure from the Foreign Office.
