They say pigs can’t fly, well, these pictures show they sure can swim.

This family of boars and piglets have set up home in the Bahamas and are rapidly becoming a YouTube sensation thanks to visitors filming themselves taking a dip with the animals.

The swine like nothing more than a trot along the beach then a swim in the tropical surf. The domesticated animals which have turned feral are fast becoming a tourist attraction as they give visitors an extremely warm welcome when they arrive by boat.

Silver screen: A filmmaker is now making a documentary about the swimming pigs of Big Major Cay and the surrounding islands

Now filmmaker Charles Allan Smith is now shooting a documentary that hopes to uncover how the animals first took to the water. 'When Pigs Swim' will follow the trail from the original swimming pigs.

Pig Island, or Big Major Cay as it is officially known, is blessed with a natural water spring and is sheltered by a string of neighbouring islands that protects it from waves caused by tropical storms.

The pigs are thought to have been introduced to the island by passing sailors who may have thought they would make a good food source.

The project will feature breathtaking shots of the idyllic crystal clear waters of the region, interviews with experts on the pig's history and, of course, the pigs themselves.

‘Because locals bring food, the pigs will run into the water and actually swim out to the oncoming boats, as if to greet them individually,’ said underwater photographer Eric Cheng, who has captured the animals on film.

‘It is strange enough to see pigs laying around on tropical beaches of white sand but to see them then charge into the water to greet oncoming boats is just bizarre.’

Mr Cheng stumbled across the unusual residents during a diving expedition to photograph white-tip sharks. Instead, he and his team spent hours photographing and playing with the pigs.

‘You never know what you’ll see when you’re out tracking down wildlife,’ he said.

The pigs are so successful in their enterprise that they are now living the dream by raising their family of eight on a tropical island in the Caribbean with nothing to do but eat, sleep and swim.

Mr Cheng added: 'Because locals bring food, the pigs will run into the water and actually swim out to the oncoming boats, as if to greet them individually.
