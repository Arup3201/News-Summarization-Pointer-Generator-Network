A fraudster, who took exotic vacations and wined and dined with her boyfriend on friends' credit cards, was jailed again for shoplifting on Tuesday.

Jocelyn Kirsch and her former boyfriend Edward Anderton were dubbed 'Bonnie and Clyde' after being convicted in 2007 of stealing almost $120,000 to spend on vacations, clothing, jewelry and even $2,000 hair extensions.

The 28-year-old was sentenced to five months at a Philadelphia court after violating her federal probation by shoplifting and failing to pay restitution for her previous crimes.

According to philly.com, U.S. District Judge Eduardo Robreno asked on Tuesday: 'Is the defendant mentally ill or is she a self-indulgent criminal? This court cannot fully answer this question.'

Kirsch, wearing a green jumpsuit, refused to answer but her lawyer Ronald Greenblatt said her thefts were caused by the depression and anxiety she suffered from media attention. 

The prosecution argued that because of her past, Kirsch deserved to be punished.

The 28-year-old was busted in 2012 for shoplifting clothes from Banana Republic, BCBG, J. Crew and Nordstrom’s stores at a mall in Walnut Creek, California. She had been living in the state since being released from prison in 2011. 

The former Drexel University student also failed to make any of the 
court-ordered, $250 monthly restitution payments to the victims of a scam
 that saw her and Anderton opening credit cards, writing checks and even
 just stealing cash from others.

Kirsch told a packed courtroom during 
her 2008 sentencing that her ‘regret runs bone deep and she will never 
repeat this mistake again,’ according to KYW.

They spent the money on lavish vacations to the Caribbean, Hawaii, Europe and Morocco.

Anderton and Kirsch dined in the best 
restaurants and attended the most exclusive parties. They flaunted their
 excess on Facebook and in Philadelphia’s society pages - which 
ultimately led to their downfall.

They were busted in 2007 after writing a phony check to a Philadelphia salon to pay for $2,000 hair extensions.

A
 little digging by the stylist led her to a postal box rented at UPS 
Store on the campus of Drexel University, where Kirsch was a student.

They were arrested retrieving a package of lingerie delivered to the post box but addressed to their neighbor.

Evidence recovered from their apartment included a professional ID maker, computer spyware and lock-picking tools.

Kirsch was sentenced to five years in prison and Anderton received four years but both 
were released early for good behavior. Kirsch served three years and five 
months of her sentence and was released in November 2011.
