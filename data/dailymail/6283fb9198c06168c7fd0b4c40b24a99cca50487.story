His sister is one of the world's most famous professional posers so it's hardly surprising that Toby Huntington-Whiteley has followed in her footsteps by launching his own modelling career.

Toby, whose older sister is model and M&S lingerie designer, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, was unveiled the  Jacamo's spring/summer model earlier this year - and now his debut campaign video has been released in all its glory.

Toby, 24, shows off his rippling abs and defined jaw as he larks around on set showing off the brand's new swimwear collection.

The personal trainer, who is signed by Models 1, even catches the attention of two elderly ladies who giggle as they walk past him showing off his honed physique on a chilly day. 

Martin Roberts, head of buying for Jacamo, said: 'Jacamo is about offering men of all shapes and sizes a choice of fashion that fits, regardless of size.

'Standing at a broad 6ft 4ins tall, Toby was the perfect fit to launch our SS15 product.'

Toby is also a performance specialist at the Workshop Gym in the Bulgari Hotel, as well as being a fitness coordinator for the SPAT, which provides fitness incentives for homeless and disadvantaged young people.

Toby, who has his sister's famously full lips, works hard to keep his body in shape. If his Instagram account is anything to go by, he starts the day with a 'super shake' full of almond milk, avocado, blueberries, raspberries, cashew butter and milled flaxseed, almonds, brazil nuts and walnuts.

He also posts plenty of videos working out, doing pull-ups and lifting kettlebells.  

He is fiercely close to his sister, Rosie, who in 2010 spoke about how she ensures her siblings have everything they need.

'I do spoil them,' she said of her family. 'I love them to bits. I think part of working so hard is so that you can spoil your loved ones. I didn’t go abroad until I was 15. So now I love to be able to send them on holiday and make sure my brother and sister have everything they need.'
