A six-year-old Chinese boy whose eyes were gouged out has been discharged from hospital after undergoing surgery.

Guo Bin, affectionately known as Bin-Bin, has been successfully fitted with implants at the C-MER Dennis Lam Eye Hospital, where he was given free treatment. 

Dr Lam volunteered his services after the boy was found covered in blood in Fenxi, Shangxi provice in August.

A special send-off ceremony took place today where the child danced to music and even offered to leave his toys behind for other sick children to play with. 

When asked how he felt, he said: 'Very happy' before thanking everyone who had helped him.

Police in the boy's hometown in northern China's Shanxi province say they suspect his aunt carried out the attack, although the boy's parents have expressed doubts. 

The woman has since committed suicide but the boy's DNA and blood were found on her clothes.

Initial reports had said the corneas were missing when the boy's eyes were found, leading to speculation that his attacker was an organ trafficker, but police later ruled out organ sales as a motive saying the corneas had been found attached to the eyeballs.

Police had offered a 100,000 yuan ($16,000) reward for information leading to the arrest of the sole suspect. Reports said the little boy had been drugged before his eyeballs were gouged out.

At the time Guo Bin's devastated father said: ‘We didn’t notice his eyes were gone when we discovered him – he had blood all over his face. We thought he had fallen down and smashed his face.’

Hope: Guo Bin has undergone surgery that could one day lead to the partial restoration of his eyesight

The boy was rushed to hospital where doctors were shocked to find his eyes had been removed. His father said: ‘His eyelids were turned inside out, and his eyeballs were not there.’But in three months Bin-Bin has made a remarkable recovery.

The boy's mother said he can now put on his clothes, brush his teeth and climb stairs by himself, according to reports in Hong Kong media. 

She said: 'His adaptive ability is very strong and he's very smart'.

Expert: Dr Dennis Lam volunteered to conduct the operations on the six-year-old free of charge

The brutal attack on the boy who has a cleft palate horrified the Chinese public and added to outrage over violence against children.

He was given eye-socket implants in September to fill his empty sockets and been fitted with prosthetic eyes which gives the appearance of normal eyes. 

The authorities have said they will help Bin-Bin find a school and he will receive regular check-ups.

In six-months the child will return to the hospital to change his eye pieces and will be given a special navigation device to help him get around day to day which will be fitted to his forehead and tongue. 

The device will capture images and translate them into electronic signals for his brain. ***
