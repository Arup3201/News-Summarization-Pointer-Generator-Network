Children of the 1960s and 1970s will be worse off than their parents when they retire, economists warn today.

The post-war trend for each generation to be richer than the last may be coming to a halt, they said.

Workers aged from 34 to 53 are being punished by inadequate pay rises, dire pensions and crippling housing costs. With meagre savings, their only hope of a comfortable retirement is a large inheritance.

'The economic fate of the 1960s and 
1970s cohorts may be relatively dependent on the fortunes of their 
parents,' says a report published today by the Institute for Fiscal 
Studies.

A study published today by the influential Institute for Fiscal Studies found workers aged from 34 to 53 are being punished by the current economic climate (picture posed by models)

Just 28 per cent of
people born in the early 1940s have had, or expect to have, an 
inheritance. For those born in the late 1970s, the figure jumps to 70 
per cent.

The report also found that family finances have been battered over the past decade.

Between
1974 and 2002, households saw income – earnings and benefits – grow by 
an annual average of 1.5 per cent. Since then the rise has been a paltry
0.1 per cent a year.

The 
IFS says the household income of 1960s children was typically £615 a 
week by the age of 40. But those born in the 1970s are on only £570 a 
week, adjusted for inflation.

Home ownership is also on the wane, the IFS said, with the picture being 'strikingly different' across the generations.

Two thirds of Londoners born in the 
1940s were on the property ladder by the age of 40. The same is true for
less than half of those born in the 1970s.

Young workers think their retirement plans will be rescued by a large inheritance, the Institute for Fiscal Studies found.

Of the richest third of people aged 30 to 39, a total of 35 per cent expect to pick up at least £100,000. For those currently in their 50s, the figure falls to just 10 per cent.

The institute's researchers said it was 'a natural consequence of the sustained economic growth seen over the post-war period' – with each generation having more wealth to pass on than the one before.

Even among the poorest third of society, 12 per cent aged 30 to 34, and 9 per cent aged 35 to 39, expect to inherit £100,000 or more.

Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at advisers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: 'The reliance on inheritance looks like a recipe for disappointment.'

Where a man expects to inherit £100,000 or more, there is a one in two chance his spouse expects to receive the same amount.

The
report says a 'rapid switch' away from well-funded company pension 
funds has hurt those born in the 1960s and 1970s. Their parents were 
often big beneficiaries of such schemes.

In conclusion, the institute warns: 
'Individuals born in the 1960s and 1970s have no higher take-home 
income, have saved no more previous take-home income, are less likely to
own a home and are likely to have lower private pension wealth.

'They
will also tend to find that their state pensions replace a smaller 
proportion of prior earnings than is the case for those currently above,
or around, the state pension age.'

Andrew
Hood, one of the report's authors, said: 'Since the Second World War, 
successive cohorts have enjoyed higher incomes and living standards than
their parents.

'Yet the incomes and wealth of those born in the 1960s and 1970s look no higher than the cohorts who came before them.

'As a result, younger cohorts are likely to have to rely on inheritances to be better off in retirement than their predecessors.

'But inheritances are unequally distributed, with households that are already relatively wealthy far more likely to benefit.'

Prospects for those in their teenage years or 20s could be even worse.

A report by the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, which was appointed by David Cameron, says they are on track to become the first in more than a century to be materially less well off in adulthood than their parents.

Ashley Seager, of the Intergenerational Foundation, which campaigns for fairness for future generations, said those 'unlucky enough' to be born after 1970 were suffering from the combined effects of 'intergenerational unfairness'.

But Ros Altmann, a leading pensions expert, said she was sceptical about the findings and said there were 'false expectations' as to how poor future generations will be when they retire.
