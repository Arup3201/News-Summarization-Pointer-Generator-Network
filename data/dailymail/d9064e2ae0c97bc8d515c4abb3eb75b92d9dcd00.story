A newlywed couple revealed today how they had the flight from hell on the way to their honeymoon - watching cabin crew flung to the ceiling in ‘terrifying’ turbulence.

Lucy, 30, and David Westbrooke, 31, of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, told MailOnline they were on an easyJet flight from London Gatwick to Naples, Italy, when it hit a fierce thunderstorm.

The couple, who married just three days ago in Sevenoaks, claimed three air stewards hit the ceiling - with one knocked unconscious and another suffering a suspected broken hip.

Mr and Mrs Westbrooke were wearing 
their seatbelts, but the bride suffered a sore neck. Several other 
people were said to have been hurt when the plane apparently hit an air 
pocket and dropped.

The 
airline has apologised to the 154 passengers on board ‘for any 
inconvenience caused’. The flight, also carrying six crew, was diverted 
almost 150 miles away to Rome for an emergency landing.

Mrs
 Westbrooke spoke to MailOnline today from Capri, having reached their 
mini-moon destination. She said: ‘There was an announcement saying that 
we’d be starting our descent into Naples.

‘The
 flight had been fine until then. My husband noticed the seatbelt sign 
went on. Most people had them off. Suddenly people were being thrown out
 of their seats and hitting their heads.

‘Suitcases
 were being thrown out of the lockers overhead. There was just utter 
panic. People were screaming. There was a baby thrown up in the air and 
the mother was just beside herself.

‘The
 crew didn’t really know what was going on. Some of the Italians on 
board were praying. One of the stewards came running down. David looked 
out of the window and saw the plane nosedive.’

Mr Westbrooke added: ‘It was the worst air turbulence I’ve ever felt. You could just feel the plane nosedive. The air stewards and stewardesses were telling people to put on their seatbelts.

‘All three of them went up to the ceiling, and damaged the ceiling. All three knocked the panels out, and one stewardess was knocked out. There were a few nurses on doctors on board.

‘The main focus was on the stewardess. They were going round making round everyone was okay. Lots of people were being sick. They ran out of sick bags.’

He added that the pilot said the plane would have to make an emergency landing to Rome instead of Naples – and when they got there, passengers were given the opportunity to get off the plane before it went on to Naples.

However, engineers then declared the plane unfit to fly on to Naples - so all the passengers had to disembark, and were transported by bus.

The couple made it to Capri at 7pm yesterday - eight hours later than planned. Mrs Westbrooke said: ‘The crew were as terrified as us.

'No-one knew what was going on. In those moments, the plane was nosediving, I thought “This is it - we only got married on Saturday and haven’t even made it to our mini-moon”. It was terrifying.’

The couple - who married at The New School at West Heath in Sevenoaks, where Princess Diana was educated in its former guise as West Heath Girls' School - had earlier described the experience on social media as ‘too scary’.

Mrs Westbrooke told her 2,000 followers on Twitter yesterday: ‘Mini-moon not off to best start. Emergency landing at Rome after hitting thunder storm and severe turbulence, member of crew knocked unconscious.

‘People thrown out of seats repeatedly and plane nosedived at speed. Screams and crying and throwing up from passengers. Too scary.’ She later added: ‘Never been so terrified.’

An EasyJet spokesman told MailOnline: ‘easyJet can confirm that flight EZY8529 from London Gatwick to Naples on September 1 diverted to Rome Fiumicino due to thunderstorms over Naples.

‘The safety and wellbeing of our passengers and crew is easyJet’s highest priority and our pilots are highly trained to manage turbulence.

‘Unfortunately due to the turbulence one of our crew sustained an injury, and as such were met by paramedics upon arrival at Rome Fiumicino airport in line with our procedures.

'In those moments, the plane was nosediving, I thought "This is it - we only got married on Saturday and haven’t even made it to our mini-moon". It was terrifying'

Lucy Westbrooke

‘The aircraft landed safely and routinely and all passengers disembarked normally and were transported to Naples by coach.

‘easyJet would like to apologise to passengers for any inconvenience caused. The aircraft was carrying 154 passengers and six crew.’

Mrs Westbrooke, who has degrees from the universities of Sheffield and Leicester, is assistant editor at Panini UK in Tunbridge Wells, and has worked for Teen Beach Movie, Just Pop, Mizz and Disney Animals magazines.

Mr Westbrooke, who also studied at the University of Leicester, is a new business development manager at i2i Events Group in Paddington, central London.
