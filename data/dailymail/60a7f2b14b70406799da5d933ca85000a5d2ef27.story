Just two weeks after the end of its historic shuttle programme, Nasa will today launch a solar-powered spacecraft on a mission to Jupiter.

The robotic explorer Juno is set to become 
the most distant probe ever powered by the sun.

The windmill-shaped craft is equipped with three tractor-trailer-size solar panels for its two 
billion-mile journey into the outer solar system.

It will blast-off from Cape Canaveral in Florida at 11.34am local time (4.34pm BST) aboard an unmanned Atlas V rocket.

After the landing of shuttle Atlantis prompted waves of nostalgia around the world, the demise of that Nasa programme is giving extra oomph to the $1.1billion voyage to the
largest and probably oldest planet in the solar system.

It will take Juno five years to reach its target, five times farther from the sun than Earth.

No spacecraft has ever ventured so far, powered by solar wings. Europe's solar-powered, comet-chasing Rosetta probe made it as far as the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.

Each of Juno's three wings is 29ft long and 9ft wide, necessary given that Jupiter receives 25 times less sunlight than Earth.

The panels - folded for launch - emanate from the spacecraft much like the blades of a windmill.

At Jupiter, nearly 500million miles from the sun, Juno's panels will provide 400 watts of power.

In orbit around Earth, these panels would generate 35 times as much power.

It is the first 
of three high-profile astronomy missions coming up for Nasa in the next 
four months.

Jupiter - a planet several Nasa 
spacecraft have studied before - is so vast it could hold everything 
else in the solar system, minus the sun.

Scientists hope to learn more 
about planetary origins through Juno's exploration of the giant 
gas-filled planet, a body far different from rocky Earth and Mars.

Jim Gree, Nasa's director of planetary science, said: 'Look
at it this way - it is a new era.

'Humans plan to go beyond low-Earth orbit. When we do
that, it's not like Star Trek. It's not "go where no man has gone 
before".'

Plunging deeper into space will require robotic scouts first, he said.

Scott Bolton, a Southwest
Research Institute astrophysicist and Juno's principal 
investigator, said it's also important for people to realise that 'Nasa's not
going out of business.'

'If we're going to 
learn who we are and where we came from, and how Earth works, we've 
got to keep doing these science missions, not just Juno,' he said.

Nasa's
long-range blueprint would have astronauts reach an asteroid by 2025 
and Earth's next-door neighbour Mars a decade later, although there's 
still uncertainty surrounding the rockets needed for the job.

A Juno 
success would be a good sign for future solar-powered missions of all 
types.

Jupiter may be just two planets over, but it's far enough away to be considered the outer solar system.

It
will take Juno five years to reach its target, five times farther from 
the sun than Earth.

No spacecraft has ever ventured so far, powered by 
solar wings. Europe's solar-powered, comet-chasing Rosetta probe made it
as far as the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.

The
choice of solar was a practical one, Mr Bolton said. No plutonium-powered 
generators were available to him and his San Antonio-based team nearly a
decade ago, so they opted for solar panels rather than develop a new 
nuclear source.

They wanted to avoid ballooning costs and possible 
delays connected with developing new technologies.

He said: 'It's nice to be green, but it wasn't because we were afraid of the plutonium.'

Long journey ahead: It will take Juno five years to reach its target, five times farther from the sun than Earth

Indeed,
Nasa's six-wheeled, Jeep-size Mars rover named Curiosity, due to launch
in late November, will be powered by more than 10lbs of plutonium. 
Despite safety efforts, there's always the question of public safety if 
an explosion occurred.

Nasa's Grail mission - twin spacecraft to be launched next month to Earth's moon - employs solar panels.

Eight
robotic craft have already flown to or near Jupiter and its many moons,
as far back as the 1970s - Nasa's Voyagers and Pioneers, Galileo, 
Ulysses, Cassini and, most recently in 2007, the Pluto-bound New 
Horizons.

Juno - named after the 
cloud-piercing wife of Jupiter, the Roman god - will go into an 
oval-shaped orbit around Jupiter's poles in July 2016, after travelling 
1.74billion miles.

The craft will fly within 
3,100miles of the dense cloud tops, closer than any previous 
spacecraft. Any closer, and Juno would feel the tug of the planet's 
atmosphere, which in turn would alter the spacecraft's orbiting path and
hamper its gravity experiment.

The spinning 
spacecraft will circle the planet for at least a year, beaming back data
that should help explain the composition of its mysterious insides. 
Each orbit will last 11 days, for a total of 33 orbits covering 348million miles.

Nine instruments are on board, including JunoCam, a wide-angle colour camera, which will beam back images.

Destination: Jupiter as seen by the New Horizons spacecraft in 2007

Juno's
most sensitive electronics are inside a titanium vault to protect 
against the incredibly harsh radiation surrounding the planet. The 
radiation exposure will worsen toward the end of the mission.

'We're 
basically an armoured tank going to Jupiter, Mr Bolton said.

Scientists
believe Jupiter was formed from most of the leftovers of the sun's 
creation. That's why it is so intriguing - by identifying the planet's 
contents, besides hydrogen and helium, astronomers can better explain 
how the solar system came to be.

Mr Bolton said: 'We want to 
know that ingredient list [for Jupiter]. What we're really 
after is discovering the recipe for making planets.'

For
these answers, Juno will study Jupiter's gravity and magnetic fields, 
and turbulent, cloud-socked atmosphere, which can spawn 300mph wind and
hurricanes double the size of Earth.

The experiments will investigate 
the abundance of water, and oxygen, in Jupiter's atmosphere and help 
determine whether the planet's core is solid or gaseous.

Once
its work is done in 2017, Juno will make a kamikaze dive into Jupiter. 
Nasa doesn't want the spacecraft hanging around and crashing into Europa
or other moons, possibly contaminating them for future generations of 
explorers.
