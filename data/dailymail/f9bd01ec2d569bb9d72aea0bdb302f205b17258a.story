A Chinese tourist has offended monks at a Buddhist temple by trying to donate his iPhone 6 instead of a fistful of loose change.

Cong Chu made the faux pas when he approached a collection box at the temple in the city of Foshan in southern China’s Guangdong province.

Tourists normally make an offering of cash, but the 31-year-old decided to drop his almost new smartphone into the box and walk away.

Monks pulled the iPhone out of the box and handed it back to the embarrassed tourist, who was visiting the sacred site with his girlfriend and friends.

They informed him that they only accept monetary donations, which are used to fund maintenance projects, and they don’t possess smartphones or know how to use them.

Chinese media contacted Cong after the snap of his offering went viral, and he told them that he did not intend to insult the monks or visitors to the temple north-west of Hong Kong.

He said: ‘I was told that if you go there you can get prosperity and good fortune for the coming year and as it was a holiday anyway and my girlfriend was going, I decided to tag along.

‘I didn't realise that we were expected to make an offering of something valuable and only had a few small denomination notes on me.

‘I didn't want to offend anyone, or embarrass my girlfriend, so I decided to donate my iPhone which was worth a good few hundred pounds as it was brand-new.’

A new iPhone 6 retails for about 6,000 yuan in China (approximately £630 or $970).

After another visitor snapped a picture of him making the unorthodox donation, he was spotted by a monk, who hurried over, opened the collection box and returned the mobile phone.

Temple spokesman Hui Ho said: "We informed him that we only accept cash donations which are used for the maintenance of the temple and the everyday expenses of the monks.

‘In any case, they don't have smartphones or know how to use them.’

After taking the phone back, the man had handed over all of the notes he had on him and apologised to the monks.

Cong was criticised after the image went viral on Chinese social media networks, with people saying his offering was disrespectful, and they accused him of treating religion as a joke.

One wrote: ‘How can anyone be so ignorant, and offer something that represents exactly what monks are campaigning against as they urge people to be more in touch with their spiritual side.’
