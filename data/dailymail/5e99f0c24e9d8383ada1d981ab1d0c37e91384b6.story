Susan Shinnick is accused of 'treating' after taking tea and biscuits to a housing complex

An Essex councillor could face a year in prison because she bought pensioners tea and cake before a vote.

Labour's Sue Shinnick took the baked goods to a sheltered housing complex before winning her seat in Stifford Clays.

But her hospitality backfired after someone reported her to police accusing her of 'treating' - which means an attempt to influence votes - and breaks electoral law.

Now Essex Police are investigating the accusation, which comes under section 114 of the Representation of the People Act 1983.

If found guilty she could be imprisoned for up to a year and/ or face a fine.

'A person is guilty of treating if either before, during or after an election they directly or indirectly give or provide any food, drink, entertainment or provision to corruptly influence any voter to vote or refrain from voting,' the Electoral Commission says.

'Treating requires a corrupt intent – it does not apply to ordinary hospitality.'

A housing complex spokesman said: 'Cllr Shinnick bought cakes and sandwiches. It wasn't a grand buffet,' the Sun reported.

A Labour spokesman said that the claim was 'pathetic'.

The police are responsible for investigating any allegations of electoral fraud.

Every
police force in the UK has an identified Single Point of Contact 
Officer (or SPOC) for electoral fraud, who provides specialist support 
and advice to investigators. 

It is understood that there will not be a dedicated force for this investigation.

An Essex Police spokesman said: 'Police are continuing to investigate an allegation of treating in Thurrock'.

The by-election called in Stifford Clays following the passing of Diana Hale.

Cllr Shinnick won the ward on October 17 with a majority of just 76. This compares with a majority of 354 in 2011.

Cllr Shinnick has been contacted for a comment.
