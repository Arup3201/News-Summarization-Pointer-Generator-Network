Formula One chiefs are proposing a speed limit to slow down cars during dangerous situations on the track, following Jules Bianchi's crash at the Japanese Grand Prix which has left the French driver fighting for his life.

Race director Charlie Whiting says it would be best to give teams the ability to cut speed automatically if there is danger on track, rather than leaving it up to the drivers.

Whiting presented a report on Bianchi's accident to FIA on Friday and later joined top officials in briefing the media.

Whiting said Bianchi had slowed down in his Marussia car before skidding off the wet circuit in Suzuka and ploughing into a recovering tractor.

But not all drivers had slowed down during a double yellow-flag situation and many did not reduce their speed. Whiting would not say at what speed Bianchi was traveling when he lost control.

'Jules slowed down,' Whiting said, adding that it was a 'matter of degrees' and that more data will have to be studied before his speed could be given with certainty.

With international federation president Jean Todt sitting next to him, Whiting showed previously unreleased footage of Bianchi's crash, which shows him driving into the tractor as the marshals had lifted a green flag to signal all clear.

'Nothing could have been done better,' Whiting said of the reaction to Bianchi's accident.

Whiting said he had asked Suzuka organisers to start the race earlier because of heavy rain and fading light but was turned down. He added the time of the start was not a factor in the accident.

The planned speed control would enhance a system already available and would, in some situations, replace the safety car, which was not on the track during Bianchi's accident.

'It's probably better to take the decision to slow down away from the drivers,' Whiting said. The aim was to build a 'way to control speed with complete certainty and clarity, with the same effect as a safety car.'

Formula One officials were beginning talks with the teams on Saturday, but Whiting said it would be unrealistic to expect any new systems to be in place before the next season.
