Adam Hills has been blasted on social media by a fellow Australian comic for 'boarding the grief train' after Hills paid his respects to the late Joan Rivers.

Aussie stand-up comedienne Fiona O'Loughlin has slammed The Last Leg host for tweeting about his 'sadness' following the death of Joan Rivers, with O'Loughlin writing that 'fame is bulls***!'.

Her strong reaction is a nod to Hills' notorious tirade against Joan Rivers, when he told Rivers 'F*** you!' during a heated monologue on his television show last year.

Hills accused controversial Rivers of being a 'd***', in a two-minute long expletive-ridden rant about the late comedienne in retaliation to Rivers' comments about singer Adele's weight.

Fearless comedienne Rivers passed away last week at the age of 81 after complications from a routine throat surgery. 

Scoll down for video 

A still from the heated rant Adam Hills made last year on his television show, The Last Leg, in which he took the late Joan Rivers to task for being 'a d***' and a 'jaded, bitter old mole'

Joan Rivers passed away last week at the age of 81, after complications during a routine throat procedure. River's passing has been met with an outpouring of grief and emotion worldwide

Hills video was shared worldwide last year, when he took offence to jokes Rivers made about Adele's weight during an interview with David Letterman.

'F*** you!' Hills yelled in retaliation, pointing down the barrel of the camera with conviction during an episode of his talk show in March 2013. 

'You, Joan Rivers, have become a jaded, bitter old mole,' Hills continued.

'Get a plastic surgeon to manufacture yourself a new soul,' 

When new broke that Rivers was gravely ill, Hills quickly changed his tune.

The Aussie, now based in England, first tweeted: 

'sending all genuine loving thoughts to @Joan_Rivers. No jokes. No dissing. Just hope she gets well soon #loveatalltimes' 

Upon the news of Joan's passing several days later, Hills again took to social media, expressing his sadness and paying tribute, writing that Rivers 'was a comic force of nature, and a groundbreaking performer.' 

Hills expressed his concern when it was announced that Joan Rivers was in an induced coma via this message on his Twitter account on August 28.

The Aussie comedian again used social media to publically share his opinion of Joan Rivers. Although, this time round, Hills approach was to celebrate her contribution to comedy

Stand-up comedian O'Loughlin called Hills out on his sudden change of heart, replying publically to Hills on Twitter:

'@adamhills fame is utter bulls***! and the worst side effect of being truly funny. Do NOT! (is my advice) try 2 board this grief train.' 

Earlier that day, O'Loughlin had retweeted messages of grief from Melburnian comedians Kate Langbroek and Peter Helliar. 

Fiona O'Loughlin took to Twitter to publically try and put Adam Hills in his place, after he posted two emotional tweets about the late Joan Rivers. Adam Hills gave a raging two-minute monologue directed at Joan Rivers during his show The Last Leg last year

 Aussie comedienne Fiona O'Loughlin has taken to Twitter, criticising Adam Hills for 'jumping on the grief train', considering Hills so publically slammed Joan Rivers for her behaviour and attitude last year.

Adam Hills is yet to respond to O'Loughlin's comments. 

His tirade was made after Rivers criticised singer Adele's weight after the Brit won an Oscar.

Rivers commented: 'You could easily pick Adele's Oscar statuette out of a lineup, it was the only one wearing Spanx" and suggested the singer should change the name of one of her hit songs to Rolling In The Deep Fried Chicken.

Joan Rivers funeral was held on Monday and was a celebrity-studded affair.

Howard Stern made jokes about Rivers' 'private parts', Hugh Jackman sang her favourite song and her beloved daughter Melissa read a moving letter to her mother.

Adam Hills' comments were made in March 2013 on his Channel 4 program, The Last Leg, during a segment in which he rants about what is annoying him in the world that week.

Hills angry tirade went viral, in which he told Rivers 'f*** you' and to 'get a plastic surgeon to grow yourself a new soul'
