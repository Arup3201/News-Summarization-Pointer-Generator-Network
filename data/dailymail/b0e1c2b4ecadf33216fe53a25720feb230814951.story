Rory McIlroy’s court case against his former management company Horizon Sports lasted a total of 44 seconds on Tuesday morning before proceedings were adjourned to see if the two warring sides can thrash out a settlement.

Mr Justice Brian Cregan entered the courtroom a shade after 11am and stayed just long enough for McIlroy’s senior counsel Paul Gallagher to request a three-hour recess. 

‘As you know the case is listed to last eight weeks and there are many issues between the two sides,’ said Gallagher, Ireland’s former Attorney General. ‘Along with Mr Paul Sreenan (senior counsel for Horizon and its owner, Conor Ridge) we would like to see if we can narrow many of these issues down and that we adjourn until 2pm.’

This was court-speak for the fact a breakthrough is believed to be close in the bitter 18-month dispute and a settlement possible that would spare the world’s No 1 golfer a prolonged spell on the witness stand.

I have it on decent authority that McIlroy offered €10million (almost £8m) to settle out of court with Horizon Sports and its owner, Conor Ridge, and end what the world No 1 described himself as a ‘tedious and nasty business’.

But Ridge, with his reputation at stake, appears determined to have his day, or rather his several weeks, in court.

In a nutshell, Horizon believe they have a watertight contract entitling them to somewhere between 15 and 20 per cent of McIlroy’s endorsement money until 2017.

Given that Nike alone will pay McIlroy $100m over the duration, it’s not hard to see why Ridge is fighting tooth and nail.

McIlroy had arrived some 45 minutes before the scheduled 11am start. Dressed in a dark blue suit and wearing glasses, he looked relaxed as he chatted with his legal team in the gathering area outside the courts known as the Round Hall.

Moving on to a more private area, he acknowledged the golfing scribes present among the 34 accredited members of the press. ‘Hello boys,’ he said, with a grin on his face.

The proceedings were held in the intimate setting of Court One, where there was little more than 50ft separating barristers sat at the back of the room from the presiding judge.

From the public gallery, a few whispers could be heard as McIlroy entered the courtroom at 10.45am. At first, it was a struggle to find seats for his team, such were the amount of boxes containing court documents that were situated on one of the designated rows of seats.

The sports management firm are also counter-suing McIlroy for £1.65m for severing his contract early

Some five minutes later Ridge entered, looking far more tense. The difference between his body language and McIlroy’s relaxed demeanour was stark.

Two minutes before the start silence descended, and there was a genuine sense of drama in the courtroom as Mr Justice Cregan took his seat, only for it to be punctured almost immediately by Gallagher’s request.

McIlroy is suing Horizon sports for being locked into what his legal team claims is an ‘unconscionable’ contract until 2017. Horizon are defending the lawsuit aggressively and counter-suing for unpaid fees, dating back to 2013.
