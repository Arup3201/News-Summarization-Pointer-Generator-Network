Princess Beatrice enjoyed a mid-week date last night with long-term boyfriend David Clark at fashionable London restaurant the Chiltern Firehouse. 

Virgin Galactic executive Clark and Beatrice have been dating for eight years and it seems that the flame still burns strong for Dave.

The 31-year-old walked a step behind his royal beau as they left the restaurant, gazing at her in a rather besotted manner. Or perhaps the dreamy look was simply down to one too many cocktails?

Dave Clark looks to still be in the first flushes of love as he followed Princess Beatrice out of the restaurant last night

The pair, who have been dating for years, chose trendy Marylebone restaurant Chiltern Firehouse for their date night

Beatrice looked stylish in a lose silk navy shirt with matching embroidered ballet pumps and a dark mini skirt for her night on the town.

The Princess kept warm in a camel-coloured wool coat with a leather detailing and carried an oversized pale green leather clutch bag.

The 25-year-old daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson has embraced London nightlife of late, attending a stream of high-end parties and events.

The princess has transformed her image from conservative to chic recently and has been using her busy social life to show off her new look.

Beatrice chose to dine out at the celebrity favourite Chiltern Firehouse again, having enjoyed a meal there just weeks ago.

The two recently returned from holiday in St Barts where they relaxed on a luxury yacht

Beatrice dined at the smart Marylebone restaurant, loved by Kate Moss and frequented by an army of A-listers, on April 4 with a group of friends.

The venue only opened in February but has already played host to celebrities such as Harry Styles, Rita Ora and Naomi Campbell.

While Beatrice and Dave keep the details of their romance private, the pair show signs of becoming ever more serious.

Just two weeks ago the young couple jetted off to the exclusive island of St Barts in the Caribbean for a little rest and relaxation aboard a luxury yacht.

The stylish royal joined her boyfriend Dave Clark, 31, who had been enjoying a boys' holiday with friends.

St Barts is a favourite of Princess Beatrice and her boyfriend, who last took a holiday there just four months before their recent trip.
