A husband and wife married 67 years died only hours apart this week.

Arthur Orvis Beard, 93, died Sunday of a stroke at his Nederland, Texas, retirement home. Wife Oneida Beard, 95, passed away the next day.

The pair met in 1945 shortly after he returned from fighting in World War II, brother John Beard told the Beaumont Enterprise. They married the next year.

Til death do they part: Arthur Orvis Beard and Oneida Beard died within hours of each other after being married 67 years

‘It's almost like they were waiting for each other to die,’ said John Beard. ‘They couldn't live without each other.’

The childless couple lived together and then died together.

‘They were fine people,’ the 85-year-old brother added. ‘They were just good people with many friends.’

Relatives spoke glowingly in comments left online about their lives.

‘When we would visit their home in Nederland, there was always a big evening dinner in the dining room with the best iced tea in the world,’ a woman identified only as Leslie wrote on Arthur Beard’s obituary.

Together into their 90s: Arthur Orvis Beard was 93 when he passed and Oneida Beard was 95

‘I remember the smell of his workshop where he loved to make grandmother and grandfather clocks,’ Leslie continued. ‘He made one for each of us kids when we grew up.

‘They lived life the way it should be lived’

Others spoke fondly of time spent fishing with the uncle they referred lovingly to by his middle name Orvis.

Another said the couple ‘were my heroes during my teen years.’

They were buried Wednesday after a joint funeral, of course.

Over 100 people attended, according to the paper.

The Reverend who presided over the service said ‘it’s most natural to talk about them together.

‘When two people marry, they become one.’
