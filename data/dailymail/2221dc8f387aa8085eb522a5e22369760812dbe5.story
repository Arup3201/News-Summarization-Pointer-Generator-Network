A paranoid schizophrenic obsessed with Batman's arch nemesis the Joker was detained indefinitely today after stabbing a stranger 13 times at a leisure centre.

Dale Pipe, 21, who had armed himself with 10 knives and an axe, savagely attacked Joshua Henley, 22, as he used a urinal in a gym before posting the Joker's catchphrase 'Why so serious?' on Facebook.

After hiding for an hour in the male changing rooms of Belle Vue Leisure Centre in Consett, County Durham, Pipe approached Mr Henley from behind and began to stab him in the back with a filleting knife.

The ferocious assault continued until staff at the centre were alerted by screams from the victim.

After he was arrested, Pipe tried to 
carve a 'Joker' smile onto his own face and admitted that he wanted to 
kill 'as many people as possible.'

Jolyon Perks, prosecuting, said: 'When standing at the urinal [Mr Henley] was unaware that he was being stabbed until he could turn and face the attacker.

'He thought that the blows to his neck and back were hard punches. On realising he was being stabbed, he fought for his life in a way that the crown cannot do justice to.'

Mr Henley was eventually able to escape, after staff intervened, and it was then that Pipe introduced himself as the Joker.

While there he was barricaded in the changing room by staff, Pipe posted Facebook message that read: 'Why so serious?' - the catchphrase of the fictional hero’s 
nemesis.

When police put a camera under the 
changing room door to observe Pipe after his victim had made it to 
safety, he was seen posing and preening himself in a broken mirror, which he 
had smashed.

More knives and a haul of violent films were found when police raided his home.

Newcastle Crown Court heard that the police later recovered a range of knives, an axe, syringes, steroids, duct tape and a balaclava from his bag.

There was also a notebook in which there was written: 'On the 16th I will kill someone.'

After being arrested he made it clear to the police that if he had been successful in killing his first victim, he would then have moved on to others.

Pipe, who pleaded guilty to attempted murder and possessing offensive weapons, has also since attempted to mutilate his own face, like that of the Joker, as he said voices in his head were telling him to do so.

After the attack Mr Henley was taken by air ambulance to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle, where he underwent a six-hour surgical procedure.

In total he suffered 16 wounds, with the court hearing any one of them could have been enough to have killed him.

Sentencing Pipe to an indefinite hospital order, Judge James Goss described him as a very dangerous young man and in need of long-term treatment.

'The terrifying and ferocious nature of the attack was described in the victim statement that was made,' he said.

'Physically
and emotionally his life has been shattered. But for his own bravery, 
strength and good fortune he would not have survived the attack.

'He remains compromised by the attack and is understandably very angry.'

Pipe will reside at Rampton Secure Hospital, where he will receive medical treatment for his condition.

Speaking after the sentencing, Mr Henley said: 'On January 28 2013 my life changed significantly as a direct result of the actions of Dale Pipe.

'I have had to wait some time for the sentencing hearing and I am relieved that the judge has seen fit to impose a sentence that will ensure Dale Pipe will not be a risk to anyone else in the future.'

The court had been told that it was only Mr Henley's developed muscle mass that protected his vital organs in the attack.

High security: Judge James Goss detained Pipe indefinitely at Newcastle Crown Court today

At a previous hearing, the court heard Pipe had been given a caution after turning up at his former workplace The Royal Derwent Hotel last Halloween wearing a balaclava and armed with knives.

He had intended an attack on that occasion, the court heard, but decided not to go through it.

Judge Goss said: '[Pipe] requires prolonged medical treatment, which for the foreseeable future, should be in conditions of high security.”

Stephen Thornton, defending, said Pipe had had normal relationships with people throughout his life and had recently lost his father.

Mr Thornton added: 'He has had auditory hallucinations since the age of 14, the most influential being that of the Joker.

'It was that voice which persuaded Mr Pipe to mutilate himself, his face, while in custody in Durham, he tried to carve a Joker face into his own face.'
