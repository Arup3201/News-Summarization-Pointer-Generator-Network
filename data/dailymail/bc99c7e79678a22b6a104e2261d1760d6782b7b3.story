A DJ left with devastating head injuries in an alleyway attack has spoken of his fury that the thug who 'nearly killed him' has had ten months slashed off his sentence.

Father-of-two Wayne Urwin suffered severe bleeding to his brain after he was felled by a single punch from Aaron Robson following a dispute outside a bar in Morpeth, Northumberland last March. 

The 37-year-old’s injuries were so severe he was put into an induced coma due to emergency surgery to remove part of his skull, while his devastated parents were told he would probably not make it through the night.

DJ Wayne Urwin, who was left with devastating head injuries in an alleyway attack, has spoken of his fury that the thug who 'nearly killed him' has had ten months slashed off his sentence

Mr Urwin defied medics to survive the attack, but says he has now been left 'really disappointed' that 20-year-old Robson has had his prison sentence cut while he will never fully recover from his injuries.

Robson, 20, of  Cramlington, was sentenced to three years and two months in prison after he admitted grievous bodily harm  at Newcastle Crown Court in August.

But at a hearing at the Appeal Court in London, the term was cut to two years and four months after Mr Justice Simon deemed the original sentence failed to sufficiently reflect Robson’s guilty plea.

This means if Robson could be out of prison in October, after serving half of his sentence.

Mr Urwin, a former Radio Northumberland DJ, hit out at the decision, saying: 'In my mind, they’re letting someone out early who was drunk and aggressive and, even after I lay unconscious, kneeled in my blood and carried on hitting me.

'Do we really want people like that back out on the streets early? He very nearly killed me and I don’t think two years and four months, which he will only serve half of, reflects that.'

Mr Urwin needed repeated surgery to treat a swelling in his brain, with bone being removed from his skull to relieve the pressure.

He has previously revealed how the attack had transformed his life, leaving him in need of further surgery to fit a metal plate in his head and suffering from seizures. He is still unable to drive to see his children Marley, seven, and Georgina, four, who live with an ex partner, or to work.

Robson’s legal team had argued at the Appeal Court on Friday, that the sentence was too harsh in light of his youth.

Mr Justice Simon, sitting with Lord Justice Davis and Mr Justice Holgate, noted the 'life-changing and serious injuries' sustained by Wayne.

He said: 'The punch knocked Mr Urwin unconscious to the ground.

'He was unable to break his fall and his head struck the ground causing him serious injuries.

'Robson also punched the victim twice while he was lying on the ground unable to defend himself in what was a sustained attack.'

However, he concluded that the original sentence failed to sufficiently reflect Robson’s guilty plea, and the term to two years and four months.

Mr Urwin, also of Cramlington, said he felt let down and was disappointed with the justice system.

'I knew the hearing was coming up and the liaison officer was going to let me know the outcome,' he said.

'But I didn’t hear anything from them, so I rang the Probation Service, who rang London, and told me he’d had his sentence cut.

'I just feel really disappointed. I think it’s completely unfair judging by the sentence I’m having to serve myself as I try to recover.

'I’m never going to finish my sentence – I’m never going to be completely back to normal. I’ve not even had the operation to put a plate in my head yet and I hear Robson could be out in a couple of months.

'His guilty plea was taken into account at the original hearing. The judge was going to give him four years but reduced it to three years and two months because of his guilty plea – he’s already had a 10 month reduction, now he’s getting a 20-month reduction, how is that fair?

'I just don’t understand the judge’s logic behind his decision.

'You hear stories of people losing faith in the justice system but, until you’re involved, you don’t realise just how much it can affect victims.'
