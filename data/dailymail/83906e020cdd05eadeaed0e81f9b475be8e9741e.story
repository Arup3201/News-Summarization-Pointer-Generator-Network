Thames Water: Almost nine per cent of the holding company that owns the water and sewerage firm was bought by the Chinese

The Chinese government has bought nearly 10per cent of Britain’s biggest water company in a move that could signal an economic revolution.

It is the first of many investments in the UK’s infrastructure and business sectors that are predicted to transform the nation’s commercial DNA.

Projects as diverse as a new London airport in the Thames Estuary to vast new wind farms, nuclear power plants, the High Speed 2 rail line and a new super sewer for London will be trying to attract investment from the Chinese.

Separately, house builders, tech 
companies and manufacturers, who are struggling to borrow from UK banks,
will be vying for a slice of the ‘Peking Pound’.

China’s sovereign wealth fund is buying 8.7per cent of Thames Water in a deal that could be worth £1billion.

The fund is fabulously wealthy, with reserves running to £300billion, which the Chinese government is keen to invest overseas.

However, the idea of an arm of a Communist Chinese government – albeit one that is adopting a more capitalist and consumer-led approach – owning a stake in a key strategic businesses is controversial.

Man on a trade mission: Chancellor George Osborne addresses the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong earlier this week.

It is unlikely that nations such as the US, Germany and France would contemplate foreign businesses or governments owning their infrastructure.

A TV poll by Sky News found 90per cent of people are opposed to Thames Water being foreign owned.

However, advocates insist that Britain will benefit from the promised Chinese investment that will fuel economic growth and create jobs.

The Chancellor, George Osborne, welcomed the  announcement saying: ‘This is a significant step by China. It is a vote of confidence in Britain as a place to invest and do business.

‘This investment is good news for both the British and Chinese economies.’

Good news: Former Trade Minister Lord Digby Jones welcomed the investment by the Chinese.

The former Trade Minister Lord Digby Jones said the investment was good news. But he said it was wrong that British companies do not have the same freedom to invest around the world.

Speaking to the BBC Today programme, he said: ‘There are two worries. Everyone praises Britain for having an open market, including the Chinese, but it is not quite a level playing field.

‘I don’t think you would find the Germans doing this, or the French or the Americans.’

Lord Jones said pressure should be put on other countries to open up their economies to allow British business to expand around the globe.

The sovereign wealth fund is run by China Investment Corporation (CIC). It announced the purchase of the stake in Thames Water in a one line sentence.

The company did not reveal the price paid, however its stake in Thames Water, which has 14 million customers across London and the south, is thought to be worth more than £1billion.

The CIC chairman Lou Jiwei announced plans in November to invest in European and US infrastructure, beginning in Britain.

The plans are part of a drive to spur global growth and so underpin the demand among western consumers for Chinese goods.

CIC was created to invest abroad in the hope of earning a better return on a portion of China's £2trillion in foreign reserves.

Mr Lou has made clear that the fund's investments are made on commercial rather than political grounds and are aimed at making a profit.

The decision to invest in Thames Water follows Mr Osborne’s return earlier this week from a visit to China.

During the trip, he  outlined plans to make London the international centre for trading in the Chinese currency, the Renminbi,  which could be worth billions to the City and the wider economy.

Thames Water, once publicly-owned, has gone through several foreign hands since privatisation in 1989.

It was owned by RWE of Germany for many years before being sold to a consortium called Kemble Water, headed by the Australian bank Macquarie.

In December, another huge sovereign wealth fund, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, bought 9.9per cent of Kemble.

It is an attractive investment because profits are effectively guaranteed by a regime that allows price rises every year.

Abu Dhabi: The sovereign state fund sovereign wealth fund, the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, bought 9.9per cent of Thames Water holding company Kemble in December.

Chinese entrepreneurs have already made tentative steps into buying British businesses. For example, Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings, which is run by Asia’s richest man, Li Ka-shing, bought Northumbrian Water in August for £2.4billion.

Other famous names to fall into Chinese hands include MG Rover and Volvo.

Last year a Chinese food company made an unsuccessful approach to buy United Biscuits, home to famous brands such as Jaffa Cakes and McVitie’s digestives.

In the past, British governments have taken a hands-off approach to allowing foreign corporate giants to snap up important UK businesses, including water and energy companies.

The result is that American, German and French business giants now own a huge proportion of Britain’s infrastructure. However, giving the green light to foreign investment has created controversy. For example, the decision to allow Kraft of the US to buy Cadbury only then to lay off thousands of workers drew condemnation.

Similarly, the idea that four of the ‘big six’ energy firms are foreign owned has angered consumers. Npower and E.on are both German, EDF is French and Scottish Power is Spanish-owned.

The Spanish also own Heathrow, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Stansted airports through Ferrovial’s ownership of BAA.
