An under-the-sea themed ceremony has seen Ariel, Disney's famous mermaid princess take on a new role as The Little Mer-wife.

Every little girl dreams of meeting her Prince Charming and having the perfect fairy tale wedding, and one woman has helped to make this a reality when she transformed a ceremony into an under-water fantasy.

Traci Hines, from Los Angeles, took on the role of the red-headed sea-maid and even bagged herself her very own Prince Eric in order to perfect the magical day.

The Little Mer-wife: Traci Hines (as Ariel) and Leo Camacho (to her right) helped to recreate the 1989 Disney film The Little Mermaid for a wedding shoot

The wedding was complete with seaside appetisers, a three-tier mermaid tail cake and a stunning beach backdrop and even bridesmaids shell printed t-shirts.

The unique ceremony is sure to make any Ariel enthusiast swoon as not a single detail has been missed.

Happily ever after: The photo shoot was created for the online wedding store, Cloud Parade 

Prince Charming: The wedding naturally took place in the sea with a trail of clam shells leading up to it

Mer-bridesmaids: The colourful bridesmaids wore pastel tulle skirts and shell bra printed t-shirts

However, fans shouldn't be too envious as the somewhat perfect wedding is completely fabricated and was created as part of a photo-shoot. 

Traci and Leo Camacho, who played Prince Eric in the scenario, are both models and shot the photographs in collaboration with Mark Brooke Photography, Mathieu Photo and online wedding store, Cloud Parade in order to showcase their stock.

Despite the fact that the wedding is purely for show, the photographs demonstrate that it is possible for fans to recreate their fantasy wedding in reality.

Inspiration: The theme of the wedding was taken from the 1989 Disney film The Little Mermaid where a mermaid, Ariel (left) is transformed into a human in order to be with Prince Eric (right)

Floundering around: The shoot appeared completely authentic with natural shots taking precedence 

Up where they walk: Ariel took her human form in the wedding but her outfit obviously took inspiration from the mermaid's fishtail 

I want to see them dancing: Leo who took the role of Prince Eric, was dressed casually in a pair of navy chinos and a white shirt with rolled up sleeves 

Not a detail has been missed, from the diamond encrusted anchor ring that adorns her finger to the golden shell around her neck, Traci is the spitting image of the Disney heroine. 

Even Leo, looks the part, dressed relatively casually in a crisp white shirt and navy chinos - ensuring that all attention is on the mermaid bride.

Traci's dress has no doubt taken inspiration from Ariel's fish tail as the hem is dip-dyed with a gradient of different blues.

Disney decor: The wedding decorations also took an ocean theme with the colour scheme featuring mainly turquoise and green hues 

Fairy tale feast: Snacks on offer included mermaid macaroons 

I've got whosits and whatsits galore: Not a single detail appeared to have been missed with Traci even wearing a golden shell necklace that Ursula, the sea witch, famously wore in the film 

Traci is furthermore convincing as she is pictured combing her red hair with a golden fork, mirroring the famous scene in the 1989 film. 

To follow the ceremony which, naturally took place on the shore of the beach, guests could enjoy a selection of ocean themed macaroons and cupcakes. 

To ensure that the guests' napkins don't blow away before they can tuck into their crustacean-themed snacks, they are held in place with golden starfish.

The majority of the detailed props used on the shoot are available to buy at Cloud Parade so fans can create their dream wedding like never before. 

The only thing that the company can't offer is a Prince Charming to go with.

Inspiration: Although the wedding wasn't real it demonstrates to die-hard fans that they can create their dream wedding 

A seaside spread: Table decorations featured aqua sequined table cloths and golden starfish 

Its a dinglehopper! Traci recreated that famous scene in The Little Mermaid where Ariel uses a fork to comb her long red hair
