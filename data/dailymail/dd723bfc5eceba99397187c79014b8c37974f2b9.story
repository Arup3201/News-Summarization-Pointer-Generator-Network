Evicence: Police commander David Duckenfield, 70, pictured today, has denied claims he helped cook up a conspiracy to conceal police failings after Hillsborough

The commander in charge at Hillsborough said today he was not behind a police conspiracy to cover up their  part in the deaths of 96 Liverpool fans.

David Duckenfield, 70, has admitted his failure to close a tunnel caused dozens of deaths but denied claims he then helped conceal 'very serious professional failings'.

The retired chief superintendent from South Yorkshire Police spoke out as he gave evidence for a seventh day at the hearing in Warrington.

He admitted that as the man in charge on April 15 1989 'the buck stops with me', but said he was inexperienced and had inherited a safety plan from the previous year.

Defence barrister John Beggs QC asked him: 'It has been suggested by some of the barristers sitting in front of me there was some conspiracy to interfere with a fair collection of evidence. Did you have any part in that?'

Duckenfield said: 'None at all, sir.'

Mr Beggs said: 'Did you know anything about it?'

Duckenfield replied: 'I did not'. 

Mr Beggs asked: 'Did you at any stage even encourage any other police officer or police civilians to change his or her statement?'

He said: 'No, sir.'

Mr Beggs went on: 'Did you change the content of the statement that the jury know was made by you on or before May 3 1989?'

He said: 'No, sir.'

Mr Beggs said: 'Did anyone ever ask you to change your statement?'

He said: 'No, sir.'

He confirmed he had no role in the subsequent investigation by West Midlands Police into the tragedy and had no part either in the direction of the force's case at Lord Justice Taylor's inquiry. 

Mr Beggs said it had been suggested by a number of barristers at the inquests that Mr Duckenfield alone should bear responsibility for the tragedy.

Mr Duckenfield agreed he had nothing to do with previous turnstile 'failures' at Sheffield Wednesday and no one had advised him about them.

He had no say on Liverpool being awarded the smaller end of the ground for the match with just 23 turnstiles.

In reality, he had 'inherited' the police operation for the match.

He also had nothing to do with signage at the ground or previous decisions to install perimeter fences and radial fences, its architectural features or any breaches of stadium safety guidance on crush barrier heights.

Mr Beggs asked: 'If supporters turned up later in 1989 than in 1988, for whatever reason, was that something with which you had any control?'

'No sir, ' said Mr Duckenfield.

Admissions: David Duckenfield, sketched giving evidence for a seventh day,  admitted he 'froze' during the 1989 football disaster before he ordered the opening of an exit gate to relieve congestion

Tragedy: 96 Liverpool fans were killed in the crush on the overcrowded Leppings Lane terrace in 1989

Yesterday Duckenfield, 70, said his decisions were a 'direct cause' of the 96 deaths and claimed he 'froze' as the disaster unfolded.

He also admitted being unfamiliar with the layout of the Sheffield Wednesday ground and said the FA Cup semi-final in 1989 was his first time in charge of a match. 

During questioning by Paul Greaney QC, for the Police Federation, he admitted he had caused the deaths of the fans.

Mr Duckenfield, who retired in 1991, accepted he 'froze' before ordering the opening of an exit gate to relieve congestion outside the Leppings Lane turnstile.

But 2,000 fans then entered Gate C, with many heading straight for the tunnel in front of them which Mr Duckenfield had not ordered to be closed.

He said 'yes sir' when asked if the fatal crush would have been avoided if he had closed this tunnel which led to the already packed central terrace pens.

Mr Greaney then asked if he had failed to recognise he needed to close the tunnel and Mr Duckenfield again agreed.

The inquests continue.
