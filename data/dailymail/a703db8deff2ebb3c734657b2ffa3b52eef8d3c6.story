Property magnate Scot Young arrived at court yesterday, a Louis Vuitton overnight bag ready packed, saying: ‘I think it’s going to be bad today.’

Hours later the one-time fixer for the super-rich was behind bars after failing to reveal the whereabouts of his ‘lost’ £400million fortune at the centre of a bitter divorce battle with estranged wife Michelle.

A High Court judge lost patience with the tycoon – who counts Topshop entrepreneur Sir Philip Green and Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky among his friends but now claims to be penniless – and jailed him for six months for ‘flagrant and deliberate’ contempt of court.

Before being led away in handcuffs to 
London’s Pentonville Prison, Young, 51 – who was allowed a kiss and 
embrace with his 29-year-old girlfriend Noelle Reno – said: ‘This is a 
sad day for British justice.’

Miss Reno, a model who lives with him 
in a luxury South Kensington flat and was once engaged to banking heir 
Matthew Mellon, said: ‘We were expecting him to be sent down, but it is 
still very upsetting for me.’

However Mrs Young, who claims her 
husband has up to £2billion hidden abroad and still enjoys a champagne 
lifestyle, said: ‘All I want is justice.’

Speaking outside court, the 
48-year-old mother of their two daughters added: ‘What other choice do 
we have when someone has not complied with court orders and is in 
contempt of court and is trying to leave me and my children destitute?’

The Youngs have been locked in one of Britain’s most acrimonious divorce fights since separating more than six years ago.

They previously lived a lifestyle of 
unimaginable luxury, owning fine homes in Britain – including six 
mansions in Belgravia – fabulous cars and a yacht in Monaco.

They travelled by private jet, and for her 40th birthday Young bought his wife £1million worth of Graff diamond jewellery.

Mrs Young left him in 2006, claiming 
their ‘volatile and unhappy’ marriage had become unbearable. Three years
 later a judge ordered him to pay her £27,500 a month maintenance.

Young said he was left bankrupt and 
penniless after the collapse of a Moscow deal, which cost him his entire
 £400million fortune virtually overnight, and has paid nothing, with 
arrears now close to £1million.

Mrs Young's lawyers argued that Mr Young, pictured left at the Outside in Chelsea art exhibition in October last year and right at Boujis 10th Anniversary Party in South Kensington in September last year, appeared to be living a lifestyle 'consistent with considerable wealth'

In 2009 he was found guilty of 
contempt of court and given a suspended six-month jail sentence when he 
was unable to provide the High Court with any paperwork to explain what 
happened to his fortune.

Mrs Young’s lawyers had asked the 
court to jail him for breach of a judge’s order last October to finally 
reveal full details of his assets.

The tycoon claims to be existing on 
cash hand-outs from friends. He said Mrs Young was trying to get him 
jailed out of ‘malice’ and he had ‘done everything in my power’ to 
answer questions about his finances.

He said he had recently been 
‘detained’ under mental health legislation, and claimed he had been 
harassed by eight private detectives instructed by his wife.

But Edward Fitzgerald, QC, for Mrs 
Young, said there was ‘absolutely no explanation’ about where the money 
had gone, and that while pleading poverty Mr Young seemed to be living a
 lifestyle ‘consistent with considerable wealth’. He added: ‘He is going
 from party to party with champagne glass in his hand and his current 
girlfriend, some supermodel or other, on his arm.’

Jailing Young, Mr Justice Moor 
described one explanation he had given for not complying with court 
orders as ‘absurd’ and said another response was ‘next to useless’.

He said Young would serve at least 
three months but could be freed at any time if he revealed the 
whereabouts of the millions and how he was being funded by ‘friends’.

The judge said the Youngs’ competing claims would still have to be argued at a hearing later this year.

Mrs Young said: ‘We were together for 
18 years and married for 12. We made this marriage together and I helped
 with finances, so why should I just walk away and be left in these 
circumstances?’
