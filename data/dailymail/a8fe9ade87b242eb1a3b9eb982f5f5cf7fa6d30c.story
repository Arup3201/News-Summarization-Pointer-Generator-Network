The Christian couple behind a mobile phone app which censors swear words from ebooks have removed all titles from their online catalogue following backlash from authors.

Clean Reader replaces certain words that might be deemed R-rated with more friendly alternatives, but authors accused it of 'suppression' and selling 'vandalised' books.

A statement from the firm this week said it was removing the titles after finding that 'many authors do not want their books being sold in connection with Clean Reader'.

The app was made available for free on both iOS and Android devices and was developed by couple Jared and Kirsten Maughan from Twin Falls in Idaho. 

After downloading the app, users are able to browse a variety of books, and when opened, can switch between ‘clean’, ‘cleaner’ or ‘squeaky clean’ settings.

The lowest setting only blocks ‘major swear words,’ according to Clean Reader, which includes ‘the F-word’. 

Lady Chatterley’s Lover by D. H. Lawrence

Before: ‘I don’t want to f*** you at all. My heart’s as cold as cold potatoes just now.’

After: ‘I don’t want to [freak] you at all. My heart’s as cold as cold potatoes just now.’

Before: ‘It was not woman’s fault, nor even love’s fault, nor the fault of sex.’

After: ‘It was not woman’s fault, nor even love’s fault, nor the fault of [love].’

Before: ‘She threaded two pink campions in the bush of red-gold hair above his penis.’

After: ‘She threaded two pink campions in the bush of red-gold hair above his [groin].’

Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn

Before: ‘The girl is one step ahead of me in everything, even sh**** luck.’

After: ‘The girl is one step ahead of me in everything, even [crappy] luck.’ 

The ‘cleaner’ setting blocks slightly more words, while the highest setting ‘is the most restrictive setting and will block the most profanity from a book including some hurtful racial terms.’

In the books, deleted words are covered up with a grey box, removing them from view. 

If users click a green dot in the middle of the box, the app will suggest alternative words that the can be used instead. 

A statement from The Society of Authors, published yesterday, reads: 'Authors have expressed confusion on social media as they have not been consulted on their works' inclusion in Clean Reader's library, and there appears to be no easy way to opt-out. 

'We have also been notified that the algorithm used is imperfect, and that words chosen as replacements can often be unsuitable or even nonsensical.'

Writing in a subsequent post after it was announced the titles were being removed from the app, she added: 'Though I’m delighted that Clean Reader are no longer selling vandalized books, they are still distributing the app, and although this is certainly a victory for books, I wouldn’t start cheering just yet.'

She added: 'If a reader chooses to avoid reading my books, that’s fine. She has that right.

'If she hates it, that’s also fine. If she has opinions on how it could have been done better, that’s also fine, because she’s entitled to her opinion, whether I agree or not.

'BUT - her opinion does not extend to changing my work in any way. My book, my rules, and that includes my words. ALL of them.' 

Novelist Chuck Wendig tweeted: 'Personally I think #CleanReader is a bunch of HOT JEEPERS MCGEE and a bucket of MONKEY FLOPPING CUPCAKE BATTER oh gosh they got to Twitter.' 

The Clear Reader statement read: 'Over the last several days we have been asking for and receiving significant feedback from authors. 

'A common theme in all of it is that many authors do not want their books being sold in connection with Clean Reader. 

'We have therefore taken immediate action to remove all books from our catalogue.'

Any books that have already been purchased will remain in users' library and an app update will be released in the near future.

The creators of Clean Reader said: ‘One day our oldest child came home from school and she was a little sad.

‘We asked her what was wrong and she said she had been reading a book during library time and it had a few swear words in it.

‘Eventually we decided we would do all we could to bring Clean Reader to the world.'
