The Hot Topics segment of daytime talk show The View was more heated than usual on Monday morning after host Barbara Walters used the N-word during a report.

Co-host Sherri Shepherd took offence when the respected newswoman repeated the word after co-host Whoopi Goldberg.

The all-female panel was discussing a hunting camp leased and frequented by Republican Presidential candidate Rick Perry and his father that once bore the offensive word in its name.

Goldberg introduced the topic,
citing a Washington Post story about a rock with the word 'N*****head' 
written on it at the gated entrance of the hunting camp.

Objecting to dancing around the topic, Goldberg refused to censor her language by saying 'the N-word' as she reported the story.

She
continued the debate, citing Republican Presidential candidate Herman 
Cain's use of the word during a Sunday interview, in which he took aim 
at Perry for his connection to the camp.

Supporting Cain's use of the word, Goldberg explained: 'It's so hard to know what to say now so I just say the word.'

Walters
followed Golderbg's lead, reporting on the name on the sign. 'It's very
hard for me to say... It gives me chills,' she said.

But 
Shepherd was quick to interject, insisting she was offended by the way 
Walters said the word, although she was okay with Goldberg's use of it.

Speaking out: The panel cited a story about a hunting camp leased and frequented by Republican Presidential candidate Rick Perry that once bore the name 'N*****head'

Location: The camp in question was the place where the Texas governor spent time with family, friends and supporters early in his political career

'When
I heard you (Whoopi) say it, it was fine. You said it a different way. 
When I heard you (Barbara) say it, I didn't like the way you said it. 
Because when you say it, you say (inaudible). And I don't like 
(inaudible),' Shepherd said.

A confused Walters attempted to 
continue a dialogue, but Shepherd admitted she could not explain why she
felt differently about her co-hosts saying the word.

Shepherd added: 'I don't know if it's a semantics thing, but it's something that goes through my body.'

'It's because I'm white?' Walters asked.

Shepherd
acknowledged race was the underlying issue: 'It's something about 
hearing you say it... I don't like it when you use the word... when you 
say it it's a different connotation...When white people say it, it 
brings up feelings in me.'

Walters contended she was only 
reporting on the topic, and meant no offence. Goldberg admitted she was 
not offended by Walters' use of the word for that reason.

However,
all-female panel - which also included co-hosts Elisabeth Hasselbeck and
Joy Behar - moved to commercial break, the discussion was open-ended.

'I never knew you felt this way and I find it just amazing,' Walters said.

The camp in question, now known as Northern Pasture Ranch, was the place 
where the Texas governor and White House hopeful spent time with family,
friends and supporters early in his political career.

When asked
about it last week, Governor Perry said it was an 'offensive name that has 
no place in the modern world' and claimed the sign was painted over by 
his father in 1983.

On Sunday, Perry spokesman Ray Sullivan released a
statement verifying the same, adding that Governor Perry has not been to the
property since 2006.

'A number of claims made in the story are 
incorrect, inconsistent, and anonymous, including the implication that 
Rick Perry brought groups to the lease when the word on the rock was 
still visible,' he said.

'The one consistent fact in the story is that the word on a rock was painted over and obscured many years ago.'
