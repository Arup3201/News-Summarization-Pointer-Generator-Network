In the vast, white expanse of Antarctica, one glacier bleeds a shocking red.

Known as Blood Falls, the dramatic colour comes from the two million-year-old iron-heavy brine trapped under the ice.

Now, for the first time, scientists have taken uncontaminated samples from deep beneath the glacier in the hope of finding microbial life.

They believe that 'extremophiles' possibly living under the surface could be unique in their ability to survive – and they may even help in the search for alien life on other planets.

Scientists recently sent a probe into the ice of Taylor Glacier to extract salty samples of water from the main vein that feeds the red-stained feature.

'This is going to be an exciting sample to play with,' Jill Mikucki, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Tennessee told The Antarctic Sun.

She explained that Blood Falls' deep red hue is caused by the discharge of iron-rich, brine liquid.

Its chemistry is changed by bacteria, which transforms sulphur and iron compounds in order to survive.

When the liquid oxidises at the surface, it creates a blood-red colour. But to learn more about the bacteria, scientists needed samples that were oxidised.

The Midge (Minimally Invasive Direct Glacial Exploration) project, led by Professor Mikucki developed a unique probe, dubbed EnEx-IceMole.

It looks like a rectangular metal box with a copper head and ice screw that can melt through ice,

'It can drive curved trajectories through bulk ice. It can go sideways, up and down. If you want to reach any point, you can go there,' Dirk Heinen, a German physicist told The Antarctic Sun.

To help the probe navigate, scientists sent acoustic pulses from the surface into the ice.

This is similar to a GPS but uses different kinds of waves that use sound to track the position of the IceMole.

Cold-loving, fresh-water algae known as Chlamydomonas nivalis that contain a bright red pigment can cause snow to appear red

Snow appears white because it reflects most visible light that strikes it. Anything that does this means you see the whole spectrum of visible light, which looks white. 

Other objects appear different colours because they absorb certain wavelengths of visible light but reflect others - a green apple, for instance, reflects only mostly the green wavelength.

But, as reported by JSTOR, when snow is deep enough it can actually appear blue. The reason for this is due to ice crystals in the snow, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC)

‘As light waves travel into the snow or ice, the ice grains scatter a large amount of light,’ the NSIDC explains.

While most of the light is reflected, there is a very small tendency towards more red light being absorbed than blue.

When you see just the surface of a pack of snow, the scattering of the blue light is almost completely impossible to notice.

But if you look into a significant amount of snow, about 3.3ft (one metre) or so, more photons emerge towards the blue end of the spectrum than the red end.

When snow appears red, though, it is for an entirely different reason. This effect is due to cold-loving, fresh-water algae known as Chlamydomonas nivalis that contain a bright red pigment.

Also known as ‘watermelon snow’, it is ‘most common during the summertime in high alpine areas as well as along coastal polar regions’.

The team focused on locating the channel through which the brine moves from the reservoir to the surface at Blood Falls.

They also used seismometers to image the ice and bedrock below, and GPS units to track glacial movement.

The team are now in the process of analysing the samples.

'It offers us a portal, or window, to the subglacial world … a sample of material from that ice-covered interior,' said Professor Mikucki.

Scientists say the results could reveal how life could exist on moons like Saturn's Enceladus and Jupiter's Europa.

Both moons are believed to have liquid oceans beneath icy crusts.

The scientists sent a probe into the ice of Taylor Glacier to extract salty samples of water from the main vein that feeds the red-stained feature. The crevassed, rough, slick surface of Taylor Glacier makes it a challenging location for research
