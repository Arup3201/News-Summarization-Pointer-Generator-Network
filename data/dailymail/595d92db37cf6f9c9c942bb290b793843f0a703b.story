Britain’s oldest fire station closed today amid emotional scenes, sparking a campaign to save the building from being immediately converted to luxury flats.

Firefighters on Green Watch were in tears as they walked out of the Clerkenwell station near King's Cross in Central London for the last time.

The station is one of 10 in the capital which closed to make millions of pounds of savings.

Supporters clapped as the firemen and 
women left, in civilian clothes, saying they had been told by their 
bosses they could not wear their uniforms.

The
 London brigade is also cutting 552 firefighter jobs and reducing the 
number of fire engines by 14 to help meet budget savings of £45million 
over the next two years.

The Clerkenwell station is more than 140 years old, and opponents of the closure believe it will be converted into luxury flats.

Local
 Labour councillor Paul Convery revealed that efforts will be made to 
have the historic building listed as an asset of community value in a 
bid to prevent its immediate redevelopment.

Alex Badcock, who has worked at the station for 29 years, broke down as he left the building.

He said: ‘This is a sad, sad day. Boris Johnson (London's Mayor) doesn't know what he's doing.’

James
 Cleverly, chairman of the capital's fire authority, said: ‘Londoners 
will continue to receive one of the fastest emergency response times in 
the world from the London Fire Brigade.

‘If
 you dial 999 and need a fire engine, we still aim to have one with you 
within six minutes and a second, if needed, within eight.

‘The brigade is faced with significant
 budget cuts which mean that changes to the service are inevitable and 
we are able to make those changes without compulsory redundancies.

‘The
 firefighters based at the stations closing will now transfer to other 
stations and continue the excellent work they do to prevent fires, which
 is vital in changing the behaviours that start fires in the first 
place.’

Unhappy: Protesters outside Clerkenwell fire station. The station is more than 140 years old, and opponents of the closure believe it will be converted into luxury flats.

Paul Embery, London 
regional secretary of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU), said: ‘Boris 
Johnson will have blood on his hands. It will be only a matter of time 
before someone dies because a fire engine did not get to them in time.

'You cannot close 10 fire stations and slash nearly 600 firefighter jobs without compromising public safety'

Paul Embery, Fire Brigades Union

‘You cannot close 10 fire stations and slash nearly 600 firefighter jobs without compromising public safety. These stations have protected generations of Londoners, and they are as necessary now as they ever were.’

The London brigade said the number of fires in the capital has fallen by 50 per cent in the last decade.

The fire stations closing are at Belsize, Bow, Clerkenwell, Downham, Kingsland, Knightsbridge, Silvertown, Southwark, Westminster and Woolwich.

A legal challenge to the closures, mounted by seven London boroughs last year, failed so the cuts will go ahead, leaving 102 fire stations and 155 engines.
