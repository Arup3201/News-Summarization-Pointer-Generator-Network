An increasing number of shops in Britain have decided to stock the new issue of Charlie Hebdo in a show of support for the victims of last week's Paris terror attacks.

The latest outlets to stock the satirical magazine, which features a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed on its front cover, are a fancy dress shop and a news kiosk.

One shopkeeper said it is 'the right thing to do' to sell the magazine in support of free speech, while another said the publication had 'caught the imagination of the world'.

Clamour: The latest issue of Charlie Hebdo, produced one week after many of its editorial staff were murdered, reportedly sold out across France within minutes

The magazine was first published in France yesterday, just a week after jihadi terrorists stormed the Charlie Hebdo offices in Paris and killed 12 people, including the editor.

Its initial print run sold out within hours as potential buyers queued up in the streets, and it is expected to sell a total of 5million copies.

The first copies destined for Britain are due to arrive tomorrow, and a number of shopkeepers have already announced that they will make the magazine available even though they don't usually stock it.

Jon Powell, who runs a kiosk selling newspapers and magazines, said he would sell a limited number of magazines on a first-come, first-served basis.

And even though the new issue has apparently been fetching hundreds of pounds on eBay, he has vowed not to charge more than the the face value of €3 (around £2.30).

'I'm a little bit concerned about the reaction, but if it's perfectly legal to sell them, we'll sell them,' Mr Powell, 36, said. 'Some of the magazines offend different people for different reasons but we live in a free society.

'It was a big call to make to publicise it, but it was the right thing to do. I have sympathy for the people who make the magazine.'

He added: 'I got the magazine in in response to customers calling first thing to get a copy.

'I phoned the wholesalers and put my name down for a couple of copies and if there were a few extra.

'After I put it out there on social media the phone has been ringing red hot and demand shot up to 30 copies.

'I know some are up on eBay but I will be selling them at face value. I'm providing the news that people want and I wouldn't want to make money on the back of misfortune.'

Matthew Stephenson, the owner of a fancy dress shop, said that he would sell 100 copies of Charlie Hebdo.

'The magazine has caught the imagination of the world,' the 43-year-old said. 'I have managed to get 100 copies to collect at 7am on Friday.

'Lots of customers have shown an interest in buying a copy. I believe they are as curious as I am to see it.'

There is a huge rush for copies of the 'Survivors' edition of Charlie Hebdo in Britain - but there is confusion about how many will be available.

The French satirical magazine usually sells around 30 copies a week in Britain.

But distributors hope they will be able to get their hands on 2,000 copies, which are likely to arrive from Friday - two days after it went on sale in France.

The UK copies are being distributed by newspaper and magazine wholesalers Smiths News and Menzies Distribution - Britain's biggest suppliers.

But they have also admitted they are still unsure how many they will get because Charlie Hebdo sold out in France this morning - meaning there may not be any to sell. 

London is likely to have the majority of copies from Friday, because it has up to 400,000 French people living there.

Larger stores like WH Smith have ruled out selling but smaller foreign book stores and newsagents will.

One, the French Bookshop in South Kensington, said: 'We will be selling it on a first come, first served basis when we get it'.

Another unnamed retailer told MailOnline they would like to sell it but are not hopeful they will be able to get any copies.

Another British newsagent was seen selling copies of the magazine which had apparently been photocopied, according to Press Gazette.

He was charging £9 for the counterfeit publications, but still managed to sell 70 copies.

It emerged yesterday that a village shopkeeper who announced that she would be selling the new Charlie Hebdo had run out of her 200 copies before they were even delivered to her. 

Only around 2,000 copies are being imported into the UK, sparking a huge rush on eBay. One auction saw bidding hit £100,000, but the sale is believed to have been sabotaged.

At an emotional press conference on Tuesday, members of staff at Charlie Hebdo vowed not to censor the magazine despite the horrific massacre which left many of their colleagues dead.

The new front cover features the headline 'All is forgiven' over a tearful Mohammed holding a sign reading 'Je suis Charlie', the slogan that has become a rallying cry for those appalled by the massacre.

The image was the work of cartoonist Renald 'Luz' Luzier, who survived the killings because he was late for work that day.

The magazine also includes cartoons mocking the two killers, brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi.

Some British Muslims have spoken out against the decision to run a cartoon of Mohammed, claiming that it is a provocative move which could further inflame tensions.

Labour MP Khalid Mahmood urged newspapers and broadcasters not to show the images, saying: 'These cartoons are not satire, they are not in good taste - they are just offensive.'

However, David Cameron said: 'When your freedom of expression is attacked in this way, I don't think it's surprising that people want to stand up and fight for that freedom of expression they believe in.'
