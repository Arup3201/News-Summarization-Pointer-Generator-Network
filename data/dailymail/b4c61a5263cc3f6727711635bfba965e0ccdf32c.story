A 32-year-old electrician who died in his burning sports car after allegedly fleeing a gun-wielding gang on mopeds is the victim of a 'cold-blooded murder', his friends say.

Father-of-two Michael Paxman died when his high-powered Audi RS4 slammed into a bus stop then a tree on Old Kent Road in south east London in the early hours of Sunday morning.

Mr Paxman, from nearby Rotherhithe, was allegedly fleeing gunmen on mopeds who were shooting at him when he lost control as he sped past an Asda supermarket at 100mph.

Police detectives are keen to trace the driver of a dark BMW M5 sportscar seen following Mr Paxman's sportscar minutes before the high speed crash.

But an unnamed friend of Mr Paxman remained convinced he was 'murdered' and added: 'He was a real petrol head, we were all petrol heads.

'They're saying three shots were fired at him and I know he wouldn't have lost control if he wasn't dead already - it was a grand theft auto attempt.

'He was a good-driver and a petrol head, if he thought he was losing control he would've slammed on his brakes but there are no brake, or skid marks, anywhere on the road.

'He was killed for his car, it was cold-blooded murder.'

Scotland Yard said: 'Police believe that Michael left his home in Rotherhithe between 0.30am and 1am on Sunday.

'He was driving a black Audi RS4, registration number KE07 HWH. At around 2.20am he was seen driving over the flyover at the Bricklayers Arms heading away from Central London towards Rotherhithe.

Tragedy: The 32-year-old died at the wheel of his car after a high speed chase in south London

Attack: Witnesses said they heard gunshots just before the car crash and friends of Mr Paxman fear it was a car-jacking that led to his death

'At 2.27am police were called to reports of Michael's car on fire after it collided with a bus stop by a tree in the Old Kent Road, east of the junction with Albany Road.

'Officers, London Ambulance Service and London Fire Brigade attended the scene and the fire was extinguished.

'Michael was pronounced dead at the scene. A post-mortem examination was held today at Greenwich Mortuary, which was unable to determine a cause of death at this stage. Further tests will be carried out.

'Detectives have established that Michael was in New Kent Road and Newington Causeway area for an about an hour before the collision.'

Detective Inspector Dave Reid said: 'Michael was a family man who leaves behind two young children, his family are devastated by his death.

'We believe Michael left home that morning to go and buy something to eat. Exactly what happened after he left is something that we are working hard to establish, and I need the public's help.

'At this stage our forensic team continue to work on establishing the cause of the holes that were found in Michael's car.

Carnage: Witnesses described how the incident unfolded like something 'out of a film' when he died at 2.30am on Sunday

Collision: Part of the black Audi RS4's engine block was thrown several metres down the carriageway by the force of the explosion

'I appreciate that there is a lot of speculation that these were caused by shots being fired at the car. Until those forensic tests are complete I cannot confirm that this is the case.

'There have been numerous reports about armed men on mopeds chasing the car and multiple shots being fired, but at this stage we have found absolutely no evidence to support that as a chain of events.

'I would appeal for anyone who saw Michael driving his black Audi RS4 in the Elephant and Castle area, or anyone who can help us clarify exactly what he was doing between 1am and 2.20am, to get in touch with us.

'I particularly would ask anyone who saw the car being driven along the Old Kent Road to contact us.

'Michael was driving at high speed prior to the collision. We are particularly keen to speak to the driver of a dark car that was travelling behind him after the traffic lights at the junction with Albany Road.

'That second vehicle is described as being similar to a BMW M5. That is the only other car driving near Michael, in the same direction at the critical time.

'Finally, a number of people tried to help Michael after the car crashed. I would ask them to contact us as soon as possible, or indeed anyone who witnessed the aftermath.

'We have already been assisted by a number of people who recorded the incident and I would ask anyone else with footage to send it to us.'
