The UK Independence Party is to contest more seats at next month’s county council elections than the Liberal Democrats, it emerged today.

The scale of UKIP’s ambitions was revealed as a new poll put the anti-EU party on 16 per cent, double the eight per cent who said they would back the Lib Dems.

Election experts predict UKIP could can up to 40 council seats on May 2, with the Tories and Lib Dems braced for heavy losses.

Almost 10,000 people are contesting almost 2,500 seats on in local elections in England and Wales on May 2

The revelation is a major boost for UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who wants to use the council polls to prove that he can take votes from all the main parties not just disaffected Tories.

A new AngusReid poll puts Labour on 39 per cent, down three points since January, the Tories unchanged on 29 per cent, UKIP up five points on 16 per cent and Lib Dems down two points on eight per cent.

Labour’s Ed Miliband is also under pressure to live up to his One Nation slogan by making big gains in the south of England.

The Tories have challenged Labour to win an extra 1,000 seats, although pollsters predict gains of 370 are more likely.

However, UKIP could be the big winner of the night with the party confident it can push the Lib Dems into fourth place in total votes cast. Tories fear they could lose 400 seats.

The Tories swept the board in 2009, turning the electoral map almost entirely blue. Four years on they are under pressure from Labour, the Lib Dems and UK Independence Party

A surprise new poll put support for UKIP on 16 per cent, double the eight per cent who said they would vote for the Lib Dems

New figures released today reveal UKIP is fielding 1,486 candidates in 27 English county council battlegrounds, compared to the Lib Dems’ 1,443.  In Wales, where only the Isle of Anglesey is being contested, UKIP has 11 candidates to the Lib Dem five.

However, the Lib Dems are fielding 67 more people in the seven unitary authorities which also go to the polls.

A UKIP spokesman said: ‘We are standing many more candidates because we recognise the importance of boots on the ground, being involved at a local level. ‘

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is on the campaign trail in Cumbria today, where he will focus his attacks on Labour and the Tories.

He has used the campaign to accuse Labour of still being a ‘blank page in British politics’.

He added: ‘They won’t accept for responsibility for what went wrong; they haven’t learnt from their mistakes; they have no ideas for the future.’

He used the party’s launch in Cornwall last week to directly criticise Labour and the Conservatives, claiming ‘you just cannot rely on the Tories to make the fairest decisions’.

He highlighted waste at Conservative councils, including in Cornwall where taxpayers money was used ‘hiring taxis to ferry teas and coffees between council buildings’ and in the Cotswolds where £19,000 was spent on a ‘motivational magician’.

But he did not refer to UKIP directly, despite the anti-EU party seeing the South West as a stronghold where it could make gains on May 2.

The Tories are determined to cast the vote as major test of Mr Miliband’s ability to win outside Labour’s northern comfort zone.

Conservative strategists point out that in 2009 the Tories were as far ahead in the polls as Labour are now.

In 2009, the Tories won 35 per cent of the vote with Labour under Gordon Brown 13 points behind on just 22 per cent, pushed into third behind the Lib Dems. Today opinion polls put Labour up to 10 points ahead of the Tories.

One Cabinet minister claimed based on a uniform swing Labour should gain 1,500 seats but 1,000 was more realistic.

Labour has sought to downplay expectations, predicting just 200 gains.

In 2009 it suffered catastrophic losses in areas where the party once dominated, including losing 28 of 44 seats in Lancashire and 29 or 32 seats in Staffordshire.

Other councils where Labour is expected to make strong gains are all in the north of England, including Derbyshire, Durham, Nothumberland and Nottinghamshire.

Labour hopes to build on gains made in local elections since Ed Miliband became leader, but the party has made little progress in the south of England

Tories are braced for hundreds of losses after gaining control of seven councils and 244 seats in 2009.

Just a year before the general election which forced Mr Brown out of power, Labour lost of four councils and 291 seats.

After being humiliated by the UK Independence Party in the Eastleigh by-election, the Tories will seek to portray UKIP as being allies of Labour, warning a vote for any party other than Conservatives will lead to council tax rises.

Voters will be told that backing UKIP will allow Labour to gain control of councils and drive up bills. ‘If you want to put up your council tax, vote UKIP or Labour,’ will be a key message.

In total almost 10,000 people are standing for election to 2,449 seats.

A total of 12 Tories are already home and dry after being returned unopposed. However Conservatives have already lost a Surrey seat after failing to file nomination papers on time.
