Investigators have found no DNA link between a professional tennis referee charged with killing her husband and the coffee mug police say she used to kill him, the woman's attorney claims.

Lois Goodman, 70, was arrested in August while she was preparing to officiate at the US Open Tennis Championships and accused of killing her 80-year-old husband, Alan Goodman, at their home in Los Angeles.

Police believe she used a coffee cup to bludgeon and stab Mr Goodman to death on April 17.

Accused: Lois Ann Goodman, seen after her arrest in New York, denies killing her elderly husband at their home in Los Angeles, California in April

Eighty-year-old Mr Goodman
was found dead in the couple's home after what authorities first 
believed was a fall down the stairs.

They
began to suspect foul play after a mortuary reported suspicious 
injuries on Mr Goodman's head, including glass fragments with a 
blood-covered coffee mug found nearby.

Ms Goodman
was arrested in New York on August 21 shortly before she was due to 
referee at a US Open tennis match.

But her attorney, Robert Sheahen now claims the DNA found on the coffee cup 'came back 
solely to the husband and not to Ms Goodman.'

He said this 'supports our theory 
that the husband was holding the cup and then he fell on the cup, and 
that accounts for the shattered pieces of the cup being embedded in the 
right side of his head,' he said.

The DNA testing results were included in exchanges of materials between 
defense attorneys and prosecutors as part of the pre-trial discovery 
process, Mr Sheahen said.

years, Alan

told police she found him after returning to their home in LA and 
believed he had fallen

Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office, declined to comment on Mr Sheahen's statements.

'We're not going to try this case outside of court and we're not going 
to comment on the evidence until it's actually testified to in the court
of law,' Ms Gibbons said.

The defense discussion of the DNA testing came one month after Ms Goodman's
lawyers said she had passed a lie detector test set up by her attorneys
in which she denied killing her husband.

Mr Sheahen said the polygraph results had been shared with prosecutors. But
under California law, the test cannot be presented in court unless both
prosecutors and defense attorneys agree, which he acknowledged is 
unlikely. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for December 7.

Prosecutor John Lewin of the major crimes division has been assigned to 
the case. Mr Lewin has prosecuted a number of complex, high-profile trials,
including one in 2007 where a former Los Angeles County sheriff's 
deputy was convicted for the 1991 murder of his wife, even though her 
body was never found.

Police said Ms Goodman called authorities to report finding her husband 
dead in their home, with no sign of forced entry, and surmised he had 
fallen down some stairs after suffering a heart attack.

But details of her account aroused suspicions, and investigators found 
that the coffee cup was broken in a way that roughly matched the 
injuries on Mr Goodman's head.

Mr Sheahen said Mr Goodman was likely to have been holding the mug and that, at the end of a
fall down the stairs, he would have smashed his head against the it.

Ms Goodman is well known in tennis circles and had worked at the annual 
US Open in recent years, serving most often as a line judge. A judge 
has allowed her to remain confined at home while the case proceeds.

Ms Goodman's daughter has described the allegations against her mother as 'completely ridiculous'.

The
prosecution has claimed Mr Goodman was struck 10 times on the head, and
argued there was evidence of his wife's pre-meditation and lack of 
remorse.

Prosecutor Sharon 
Ransom previously told a judge that Ms Goodman went to get a manicure while
her husband lay dying.

But defence attorney Alison Triessl claimed her client was physically incapable of committing the crime, saying that she suffers from rheumatoid arthritis, 
hearing loss and constant spinal pain that is controlled by an electronic
device implanted in her spine.

She 
had told detectives that she arrived home and found a trail of blood leading 
upstairs to a broken mug covered in blood.

She followed the blood to her
bedroom, where she found her husband not breathing, according to the 
affidavit. She then dialled 911.

Investigators
also believed a large bloodstain near the stairs suggested he had 
suffered an injury and stayed there for some time, court documents said.

When
she was questioned again, Mrs Goodman said the body looked as if it had 
been positioned by an intruder. Despite these conflicting accounts, 
Ms Goodman has protested her innocence.

She
has refereed at the US and Australian Opens for years and has umpired
with some of the world's top tennis players, including matches with 
Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe and Martina Navratilova.

In
a 1994 interview with the LA Times, she said: 'It's exciting. This is
my favorite sport and I'm out there rubbing shoulders with the best 
players. There's no real way to describe it.'
