Millions of people have been feeling the arctic chill this week as America's deep freeze continues.

And one Minnesota resident decided to show just how cold it is - by jumping on a frozen trampoline.

Nathan Ziegler filmed himself clearing snow off his trampoline, before spraying two layers of water over it. After it froze, he then jumped backward onto its surface, causing ice to fly everywhere.

The school principal later posted the video of his stunt to YouTube, as part of his 'Minnesota Cold' series, where it quickly went viral, with more than 435,000 views on the site alone so far.

SCROLL DOWN THE VIDEO

Frigid conditions: Nathan Ziegler is seen jumping backward onto a frozen trampoline at his Minnesota home

Impact: The school principal, who lives in Minneapolis, lands on the circle of ice, causing it to crack loudly

Risky stunt: The ice smashes into thousands of shards, most of which fly into the air, surrounding his body

Icy air: Mr Ziegler later posted the footage of his experiment to YouTube as part of his 13-strong 'Minnesota Cold' video series. The video quickly went viral - with more than 435,000 views on the site alone so far

In the footage, Mr Ziegler can be seen sweeping snow off the trampoline with a brush amid the extreme conditions, including severe wind chills and temperatures as low as minus eight degrees.

Donning a snowsuit, hat and gloves, the Minneapolis resident then drags a long water hose out of his house, before spraying two layers of water over the trampoline and waiting for it to freeze.

A shot, taken from beneath the trampoline, shows the underside of its surface covered in icicles.

After the water has completely turned to ice, Mr Ziegler then climbs onto the edge of the trampoline and bends his knees. Seconds later, he launches himself backward into the frigid air.

Freezing: Many YouTube users have reacted positively to the footage, with some deeming it 'cool', 'awesome' and 'exhilarating'. Others have agreed that it is perfect example of just how cold America is at the moment

Still: Mr Ziegler is pictured lying still on his trampoline after filming himself jumping onto its frozen surface

As he lands on the trampoline's surface, the entire circle of ice smashes into thousands of shards, most of which fly into the air, surrounding his body and striking the camera lens.

Mr Ziegler, formerly a science teacher, later videos himself walking across the surface of the trampoline, the broken ice making a crunching sound beneath his boots.

And it is not the only video Mr Ziegler has taken that shows the effects of the current deep freeze.

Clearing away snow: In the footage , the principal can be seen sweeping snow off the trampoline with a brush amid the extreme conditions, including severe wind chills and temperatures as low as minus eight degrees

Preparation: Donning a snowsuit, hat and gloves, he then drags a long water hose out of his house, before spraying two layers of water over the trampoline and waiting for it to freeze. He later performs the stunt

As part of his 'Minnesota Cold' series, he has also filmed himself blowing bubbles that immediately freeze in the air and pounding a nail into a piece of wood with a frozen banana.

It comes as temperatures in Minnesota plunged below zero again on Friday morning, with a wind chill of minus 29 Fahrenheit making it feel far colder, according to the National Weather Service.

Emergency crews were called to dozens of crashes in the state just a day after the icy weather led to at least 654 collisions during Thursday's commutes. No-one is believed to have been killed. 

And Minnesota isn't the only to have been affected by the extreme conditions, with bitterly cold temperatures and wind chills continuing to sweep all of the states in the eastern half of the US.
