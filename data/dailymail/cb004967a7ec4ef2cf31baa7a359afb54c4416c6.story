As they climb the plush staircase side by side, watched by liveried footmen, there is no mistaking the glamour of the occasion.

This is Downton Abbey’s rebellious Lady Rose, accompanied by her aunt Cora, Countess of Grantham, at her 'coming out' at Buckingham Palace.

The scene is from the two-hour Christmas Day episode, which promises to be quite the contrast to last year’s festive offering. Then, many fans complained that ITV had ruined their day by killing off much-loved character Matthew Crawley in a car crash.

From the Abbey to the Palace: The Christmas Episode sees the family and servants travel up to London for the summer season. The Crawleys' impressive London residence, Grantham House, is seen for the first time

Downton Abbey: Martha Levinson and Cora's brother Harold make an appearance along with several guest characters including Lord Aysgarth and daughter Madeleine

This year it would seem they can look
 forward to a cheerier affair as the Crawley family and their servants 
celebrate the summer season.

Downton
 will be ITV’s big weapon in the traditional battle for Christmas Day 
viewers with BBC1, starting at 8.30pm and going head-to-head with the 
corporation’s soap EastEnders.

ITV
 have given a tantalising peek at this year’s Downton special, set six 
months on from the end of the recently completed series four.

Impressive: The two-hour Christmas Special of Downton Abbey is set at Buckingham Palace, with scenes actually filmed around the corner from the royal residence at Lancaster House in London

Set: Buckingham Palace is used as the scene of the 'coming out' of Lady Rose in the Christmas Special of Downton Abbey

Debutante Lady Rose, played by 24-year-old Lily James, is at Buckingham Palace to be presented to society in a floor-length white gown, white gloves and an elaborate feathered head dress.

Usually up to mischief, she behaves herself as she curtseys for King George V and his wife Queen Mary.

But despite being surrounded by a host of wealthy bachelors, the moment is likely to prove bittersweet for Rose, who viewers know is in love with jazz singer Jack Ross, the show’s first black character, who called off their engagement at the end of Series Four.

ITV's big weapon: Shirley Maclaine as Martha Levinson, Paul Giamatti as Harold Levinson and Jim Carter as Mr Carson in Downton Abbey

Cast: The Downton Abbey cast for the Christmas special which will be aired at 8.30pm on Christmas Day

Summer love: Is Cora's playboy brother Harold trying to woo Madeline (Poppy Drayton), daughter of Lord Aysgarth (James Fox)?

She is presented by her aunt Cora, played by Elizabeth McGovern, who also appears elegant in a 1920s silver drop-waist floor-length dress and pearls.

The royal scenes were masterminded by show creator Julian Fellowes alongside historical adviser Alastair Bruce, who cameos as the Lord Chamberlain.

But it wouldn’t be a Downton Christmas without a little trouble. When the Crawleys find themselves implicated in a scandal which threatens to engulf the monarchy, the Earl of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville) goes to great lengths to protect both the Royal Family and his own.

Fans can also look forward to the return of Cora’s American mother Martha Levinson, played by Hollywood legend Shirley MacLaine, and Cora’s playboy brother Harold, played by Paul Giamatti.

Also joining the cast is James Fox as Lord Aysgarth and Poppy Drayton as his stunning daughter Madeline.

Elsewhere in the Christmas Day schedules, EastEnders will see the debut of hard man actor Danny Dyer as the new landlord of the Queen Vic.

The soap will be followed at 9.30pm by sitcom Mrs Brown’s Boys, which despite being panned by critics was watched by 11.7million viewers last Christmas, coming second only to Strictly Come Dancing in the ratings.

This year Strictly itself will air on BBC1 at 5pm, up against Paul O’Grady’s hit For The Love Of Dogs on ITV.

At 7.30pm ITV soap Coronation Street will compete with BBC1’s much-anticipated Doctor Who special The Time Of The Doctor, in which Matt Smith’s Time Lord will make his last appearance, regenerating into Peter Capaldi.

One thing that unites BBC1 and ITV, however, will be the traditional 3pm showing of the Queen’s Christmas message.
