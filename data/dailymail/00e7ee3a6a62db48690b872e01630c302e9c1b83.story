In the latest edition of our series on the travel habits of the rich and famous, crime novelist Ruth Rendell talks memories of Venice and Margate.

Ruth Rendell: A long-running affair with Venice

Favourite place?

Venice. I've been at least 20 times. It's full of nostalgia.

Earliest holiday memory? 

Walking along the beach at Margate with my parents in the rain. I was probably about five.

Favourite museum?

The National Portrait Gallery.

Your top travel tip? 

Take the best travel guide you can find.

Favourite dining companion? 

I wouldn't want to have dinner with a celebrity or an actor or a film star. I only ever want to dine with good, close friends.

Worst travel experience? 

Singapore, where I stopped over in on my way to Australia. There was nothing to do there except shop.

Where next, and what for? 

In May I'm on a cruise to Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Russia. Cruising offers a unique viewpoint from which to see lots of different destinations.
