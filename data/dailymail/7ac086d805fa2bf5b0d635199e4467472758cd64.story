Argentinian football thugs are planning to ambush and attack England fans during the World Cup, police have warned.

More than 650 violent 'ultras' are believed to be travelling to the tournament in Brazil from neighbouring Argentina, according to reports.

Many are heading to Belo Horizonte, where Argentina will be based and where both sides play group games just days apart later this month.

Battle: Argentinian thugs are planning to ambush and attack England fans during the World Cup in Brazil

Police in the city suggested that members of the notorious Argentinian Barra Brava groups have made alliances with equally violent Brazilian ultras - and are preparing attacks on rival England fans.

One Brazilian ultra group, Mafia Azul, have reportedly rented a ranch on the outskirts of the city in southeast Brazil to accommodate dozens of Barras Bravas linked to Argentinian club San Lorenzo.

The Mafia Azul group, linked to Belo Horizonte side and current league leaders Cruzeiro, were banned from stadiums in Brazil earlier this year after violent confrontations with rival fans which left several people dead.

Miliary police chief Col Divino Brito told Brazil's Estado de Minas newspaper he believes Argentinian and Brazilian soccer thugs are preparing to team up to attack English fans while they are in town.

He said: 'Our worry is that in the interval between one match and another, when we are going to have thousands of fans from Argentina and then from England, there are going to be clashes.

'We will deal forcefully with any foreigner who comes here wanting to commit violence and vandalism.'

But Col Alberto Luiz Alves admitted: 'We can normally monitor groups with a history of violence.

'But we would only know of dangerous fans if they enter by air, and in the case of the Argentinian Barra Bravas most will be arriving by land. It will be very difficult to keep track of them.'

At least 11,000 Argentinian fans have bought tickets to see their side play Iran on June 21 in Belo Horizonte.

Three days later, over 7,500 England fans are expected in the city in southeast Brazil for their final group game against Costa Rica.

The Barras Bravas are known as some of the world's most violent supporters, and have been blamed for at least 120 football-related deaths in Argentina in the past 20 years.

Earlier this year Debora Hambo, a lawyer representing the Barras Bravas, warned that Argentinian fans were preparing to face the English in Brazil - in revenge for losing the Falklands War.

Supposedly relaying a message from the group's leader, she said: 'The Argentine people have a good memory and they will never forget nor forgive.

'We will always remember what happened in 1982.'

She added: 'They are not cowards. They are not concerned about their physical integrity. It doesn't matter to them, they risk their lives every minute.

'They are brave beyond life and death. That is why they have a violent reputation.'
