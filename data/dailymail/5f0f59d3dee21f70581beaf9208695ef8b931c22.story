Will: DJ Jimmy Savile visiting the patients and staff of Leeds General Infirmary in 1972. His estate is reportedly worth £4.3million

The estate of Jimmy Savile has been frozen in response to the mounting sexual abuse claims against the late television and radio star.

NatWest Bank, which is acting as the Jim'll Fix It presenter's will executor and trustee, said the distribution of his assets had been put on hold because of the allegations.

Savile's estate is reportedly worth £4.3 million.

NatWest said in a statement: 'Given the claims raised, distribution of the estate has been put on hold.'

Savile's
will was written in 2006 and bequeaths his savings and other assets to 
26 separate beneficiaries, according to the Financial Times (FT).

The
newspaper said it had obtained a copy of the document which instructs 
that £20,000 in cash was to be shared between 20 of the celebrity's 
friends, family and neighbours.

It says a further £600,000 was to be put into a trust fund, with the interest shared between eight people.

The
remainder - just under £3.7 million before expenses - was to be held by
NatWest on behalf of The Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust, according to 
the FT.

Savile's intended individual beneficiaries include the trustees of both his charities and existing and former employees of Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor Hospital, the newspaper added.

Police are investigating claims that the star, who died in October last year, sexually assaulted individuals at both NHS sites.

Savile's estate was previously put on hold in July after a woman claimed to be his illegitimate daughter, the FT said.

It is believed the latest freeze may be in anticipation of legal claims for damages by Savile's alleged victims.

A solicitor representing the alleged victims welcomed NatWest's decision.

Alan Collins from law firm Pannone said, 'This is good news for those victims of Savile who are taking legal action, as it means that they will be able to pursue claims against the estate.

Savile is now believed to have been one of the UK's most prolific abusers, with about 300 possible victims

'If NatWest had not put the estate on
hold, it would have meant legal action against Savile's estate to 
prevent the assets from being distributed amongst the beneficiaries of 
his will.'

He added: 'Pannone are also actively 
pursuing inquiries into Savile's overseas assets, which we believe are 
being administered in Guernsey.'

Scotland Yard is leading a national investigation into the television and radio star's activities.

He is now believed to have been one of the UK's most prolific abusers, with about 300 possible victims.

Detectives are following 400 lines of inquiry as part of the investigation while the BBC has launched an inquiry into the culture and practices at the corporation in the era of Savile's alleged sexual abuse.

It is also looking at the decision-making process that saw a Newsnight investigation into Savile's activities shelved.
