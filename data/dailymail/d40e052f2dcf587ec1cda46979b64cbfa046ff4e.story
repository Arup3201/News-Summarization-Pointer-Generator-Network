An Arizona school district says it's investigating after doubts were raised about a high school teacher and volleyball coach who said she earned a PhD as well as won an Olympic silver medal.

Christie Slegers has taught science at Fountain Hills High School since 2013 and recently took on coaching responsibilities for the girls varsity volleyball team.

'I played college ball before making the U.S. team,' Slegers told the Fountain Hills Times when she started her coaching stint. 'So, yes, I am an Olympic silver medalist. I know a little bit about volleyball.'

No glory: USA Volleyball says Christie Slegers, who coaches volleyball at Fountain Hills High School, was not an official member of the delegation at the 1984 Olympics, where the women's team won silver

When she told the team that she was a medalist, a suspicious parent investigated the claim and notified the school.

Fountain Hills High School principal Tom Brennan responded: 'We are satisfied with the information Dr. Slegers provided to us, and consider this matter closed.' 

KPHO contacted USA Volleyball, who said Slegers, under her maiden name, was never a medalist.

'Christie Currie (Slegers) was not a member of the official delegation/team for the 1984 U.S. Olympic Volleyball Team,' the organization responded.

When it came to her academic qualifications, there were more questions.

Fountain Hills High School's website calls Slegers the science department chair and she's listed as having a PhD.

Even Slegers's LinkedIn doesn't mention a PhD, saying she studied at St Cloud State University in addition to earning a bachelor's in biology and chemistry from Hamline University.

'Christie Jean Currie did not earn a degree at St. Cloud State University,' St Cloud confirmed to KPHO. 'She earned the equivalent to a Biology major at the undergraduate level.'

Now the issue has gone up to the district, with superintendent Tom Lawrence telling KPHO: 'The investigation is ongoing, and I cannot comment beyond that.'
