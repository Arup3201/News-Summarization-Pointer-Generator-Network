Barcelona have stood firm in their defiance that Liverpool only received £65million for Luis Suarez.

The reaffirming of their stance came on Tuesday afternoon as the club’s sporting director and vice president gave statements on how much they’d spent this summer in a bid to show ‘transparency’.

Suarez completed a move to the Nou Camp before the season started and after a highly controversial World Cup episode to see him bite Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini.

The Uruguay star is still banned from playing any first team games, but it was still believed that Liverpool recouped £75m for their star striker – a claim Barca have always refuted.

The Catalans revealed their overall net spend this summer in an act of transparency they hope will alleviate any ongoing financial problems with UEFA.

Sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta said on Tuesday: ‘We are speaking to you in order to communicate transparency. We know we are the only club in the world that is like this, but we want to observe the clarity that makes us so unique.’ 

Along with Suarez, manager Luis Enrique brought in Ivan Rakitic, Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Claudio Bravo and Thomas Vermaelen for a combined £125m.

The club also revealed that they brought in fees of £62m after selling Cesc Fabregas, Alexis Sanchez and Bojan to the Premier League as well as Jonathan Dos Santos to Villarreal.

Zubizarreta revealed that Barcelona’s net spend this summer was in the region of £63m.
