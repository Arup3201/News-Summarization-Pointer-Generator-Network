Ebola tests on two children at a hospital in Melbourne have come back negative for the virus.

Victoria's deputy chief health officer Michael Ackland said the girls, aged four and eight, who were admitted to Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital on Thursday, are being treated for a respiratory illness.

Despite being cleared for now, the girls will again be tested in 72 hours to rule out the possibility of having contracted the Ebola virus, something Professor Ackland said was a normal process.

The girls returned home to Melbourne overnight with their parents and another sibling following an extended trip to Guinea.

Two children under the age of 10 were tested for the deadly Ebola virus at The Royal Children's Hospital

Other family members remain well.

'Routine screening of returning travellers from Ebola-affected countries in west Africa identified that the girls had elevated temperatures,' Prof Ackland said in a statement on Thursday.

In accordance with universal infection control procedures, they were taken to Royal Children's Hospital to be assessed for a range of infections including Ebola.

He says it's unlikely other travellers on the plane from Abu Dhabi or others who had contact with the girls inside the airport will fall unwell.  

Earlier on Thursday, a spokesperson for The Royal Children's Hospital told Daily Mail Australia that the patients are being kept in isolation.

Medical staff are battling against Ebola in West Africa 

'Two patients have been isolated at The Royal Children's Hospital following admission this morning with an infectious disease. The children, aged under 10, are being tested for a range of infectious diseases, including the ebola virus,' the spokesperson said. 

'Specialist medical staff are caring for the patients, using the procedures and equipment in which they have been trained. The safety of staff and the community is paramount.

'Results of the diagnostic testing will be known within a few hours. The hospital is unable to provide further information about the patients or their conditions until the test results are known.'

The ABC reports the children were suffering 'elevated temperatures' when they touched down at Melbourne Airport from an Ebola-affected country on Wednesday night.

In October, Australia prompted outrage by becoming the first Western country to ban visitors from Ebola-hit areas of Africa, amid warnings the restrictions could make it harder to fight the deadly disease.

The outbreak has become the deadliest occurrence of the disease since its discovery in 1976

In a dramatic move, the government said it would refuse entry to anyone travelling from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leona - the countries most severely hit by the epidemic - despite there being no known cases of the virus in Australia.

But a Sierra Leone official condemned the ban, describing it as 'counter-productive' and 'too draconian'. 

Liberia's president urged Australia to reconsider its decision, while UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon warned travel restrictions could seriously hamper efforts to beat Ebola. 

There have been numerous Ebola scares in Australia since the outbreak in West Africa was first reported in March 2014. The outbreak has become the deadliest occurrence of the disease since its discovery in 1976.

Sue Ellen Kovack volunteered as a nurse treating Ebola patients in Sierra Leone and was tested for the disease when she returned to Australia

In October last year, a volunteer nurse was monitored inside a Queensland hospital for Ebola.

Her test results returned as negative, a Queensland Health official has confirmed.

Sue Ellen Kovack was tested for the deadly virus on her return from Sierra Leone where she was volunteering with the Red Cross in the fight against Ebola.

There were fears the 57-year-old, from Cairns, was suffering from the illness she was helping to treat after she reported feeling a fever. Ms Kovack was put under observation and quarantined at Cairns Hospital.
