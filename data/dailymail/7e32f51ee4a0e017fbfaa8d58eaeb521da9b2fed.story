Real Madrid forward Isco has revealed his and and his team-mates' bitter disappointment after dropping points for the second successive game in La Liga. 

After being held to a 1-1 draw at home to Villarreal last weekend, Los Blancos lost 1-0 at Athletic Bilbao on Saturday, giving title rivals Barcelona the opportunity to leapfrog them in the table if they can beat Rayo Vallecano at the Nou Camp.  

Isco confessed to the Spanish media that Madrid's recent dip in form had left the players feeling out of sorts. Following the defeat by Bilbao he said, 'We leave here with a bad feeling in our stomachs because this is now two straight games without a win and that is a real shame.'

He added, 'Lately we have been lacking a bit of freshness up front and that is not normal for Real Madrid, but it is a matter of phases.' 

Isco is adamant Real can complete their turnaround before the crunch clash with Barcelona on March 22,  'The league is difficult but it is long and we'll go to Camp Nou in a couple of weeks with all the enthusiasm in the world. It is a decisive match.' 

Before then, though, Real will have to pick themselves up for the second leg of their last 16 Champions League tie with Schalke on Tuesday, whom they lead 2-0 on aggregate, and another La Liga match with Levante on March 15.
