Michelle Williams and Stacy Keibler both had the white stuff at this evening's  Critics' Choice Awards.

Both women wore variations of the monochrome shade for the awards ceremony in Los Angeles.

George
Clooney's girlfriend opted for a more sexier version of the hue, 
slipping her incredibly toned figure into a body skimming floor-length 
number.

Two ways to wear white: Stacy Keibler and 
Michelle Williams both looked angelic in shades of white at the Critics' 
Choice Awards in Los Angeles this evening

On the arm of her boyfriend Clooney, who was nominated for Best Actor, the pro-wrestler was radiant.

The cowl-neck gown complimented the 31-year-old tanned and well-honed physique.

The 5'11 blonde wore her hair out in a loose wave and she accesorised her slinky attire with a bejeweled clutch bag.

Meanwhile Michelle, who was nominated 
for Best Actress for her role in My Week With 
Marilyn, looked demure in a black and off-white wrap-around sateen gown.

The
two-toned attire was sophisticated and chic, and cinched at the waist with a matching embellished belt.

The creamy hue complimented the star's stunning porcelain complexion and ginger-coloured crop, which was perfectly coiffed.

for Best Actress this evening for her title role in My Week With 
Marilyn, looked demure in her black and off-white wrap-around sateen gown 
complete with rosette sash

Michelle carried a black clutch and two bangle bands on both of her wrists.

The other monochrome shade was also 
popular on the night, with both Charlize Theron and Evan Rachel Wood 
crossing over to the darker side.

Charlize,
who was also nominated for Best Actress for her role in Young Adult, 
looked chic in a tiered black gown featuring a scalloped neckline.

Keeping close: George leaned in close to his gorgeous girlfriend

The currently single 36-year-old 
South African star had her blonde tresses braided into a low-slung 
chignon and wore diamond studs in her ears and an art deco style ring on
her finger.

Evan went for a more Gothic style look in a lace strapless gown with tie at the waist.

She also wore braids in her hair but went for a more all over look.

Charlize
posed on the carpet with fellow Best Actress nominee Tilda Swinton, who 
surprised onlookers by wearing more conservative attire.

The usually quirky dressed star,
who is nominated for her role in We Need To Talk About Kevin, also 
opted for monochrome, in a black and white tuxedo style suit.

Meanwhile Emma Stone, whose movie The 
Help was nominated for Best Ensemble Cast, offered a splash of colour in
the form of a emerald and blue printed floaty floor-length frock.

The powerful green was a stunning contrast to the 23-year-old red tresses and blue eyes.

Mellow in yellow: A little ray of sunshine came in the form of both Diane Kruger and Best Actress Nominee Elisabeth Olsen

Fashion
fail: A fashion disaster came in the form of Elle Fanning, who opted 
for a mint-coloured vintage-style dress adorned with daisies

Her co-star Jessica Chastain also masterfully complemented her ginger locks and porcelain skin with her attire.  

The Tree Of Life actress was pretty in pink in her high-neck billowing sateen gown.

LBD's: Actresses Kirsten Dunst and Judy Greer opted for pretty little black dresses

Intricate: Kick Ass star Chloe Moretz looked all
grown-up in a intricate little black dress, which featured tulle and 
beaded detailing as well as fluffy cap sleeves

Diane, 35, looked gorgeous in a pleated Grecian-style gown, which featured a creamy pastel yellow sash wrapped around the neck.

The splashes of lemon on the dress were complimented by soft dove grey and she contrasted the look with a candy pink clutch.

Meanwhile Elizabeth, 22, paraded her slim pins in an intricately beaded and embellished bright yellow mini dress.

Sophisticated ladies: Best Supporting Actress Nominee Melissa McCarthy and Best Actress nominee Tilda Swinton both looked chic for the night

No 'help' needed in the style stakes: The Help co-stars and nominees Viola Davis and Octavia Spence both looked sensational in their plunging dresses

The long-sleeved frock featured a tiny 
ruffle around the hem and bust line, and she paired the look with some 
beige peep-toe heels and a black and gold clutch.

Kirsten Dunst slipped into her favourite designer Chanel for the big award's night.

The 29-year-old Melancholia star's flirty black dress featured ribbons and bows and a tulle hemline.

She polished off the look with a low-slung ponytail and some black suede peep toe platform shoes.

A fashion disaster came in the form of Elle Fanning, who opted for vintage-style on the red-carpet.

Still hobbling: Brad Pitt arrived with his walking cane, still clearly suffering from his skiing injury in the snow last week

Dapper: The 48-year-old actor looked dapper in a slimline black suit, as did director Stephen Spielberg in his navy two-piece

Her mint-colored gown adorned with bright yellow daisies hit a style low-note for the usually fashion forward 13-year-old.

The gown appeared to be more grandma than grunge on the teen.

Melissa McCarthy on the otherhand was positively glowing in her navy sequined number.

The 41-year-old Mike & Molly star, who is 
nominated for Best Supporting Actress for her hilarious role in Bridesmaids, looked gorgeous in one of her own creations.

Ruffled feathers: Carrie Keagan's peacock-style strapless dress was a bit too over-the-top for the occasion

Glamour factor: Best Supporting Actress 
nominee Bernice Bejo, and actresses Wendi McLendon-Covey and Busy 
Phillips all looked stunning on the night

Party people: Missi Pyle, Anna O'Reilly and Isabelle Furham all opted for soft colours in their attire

At
tonight's Critics' Choice Awards at the Santa Monica Auditorium, 
Leonardo DiCaprio, who was also nominated for Best Actor for his role in
J. Edgar, decided to skip the red-carpet.

Instead, the actor was seen having a ball at the ceremony inside.

He also planted a kiss on his old pal Martin Scorsese, who directed the 37-year-old in Gangs Of New York and The Departed. 

The
Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards, which is commonly referred 
to as the Critics' Choice Awards, are designed to honor those for their 
cinematic achievements.

The award nominees have often anticipated who will be nominated for Academy Awards.
