It's a big week for baby Prince George of Cambridge as the world will be watching on Wednesday as he's christened. But from the look of these pictures, he's already getting used to posing for the cameras with his mother and father, Kate and Prince William.

The images show him scrubbing up in a bubble bath with his parents, being fed by his father and being snapped on a mobile phone by his great-grandmother, the Queen, before she helps tuck him into bed.

But look closely and you'll see this isn't a rare insight into the life of the royal new parents. It's the work of artist Alison Jackson, who is renowned for her elaborate 'spoof' productions which give an imaginary and amusing behind-the-scenes look into the world of celebrities and royals.
