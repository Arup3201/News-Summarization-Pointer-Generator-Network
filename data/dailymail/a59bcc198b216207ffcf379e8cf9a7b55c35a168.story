Britain has been damaged by 
‘unthinking climate change worship’, a senior Tory minister claimed 
today as the coalition parties clashed over going green.

Lib
 Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey is using the floods crisis to launch
 an extraordinary attack on ‘diabolical’ and ‘wilfully ignorant, head in
 the sand, nimbyist’ Conservatives who question global warming.

But Conservative energy minister Michael Fallon has hit back, insisting now is not the time for ‘political’ squabbling.

Clash: Lib Dem Ed Davey attacked Tory climate sceptics but Tory energy minister Michael Fallon warned against coalition squabbling

The
 storms which have wreaked havoc across much of England and Wales have 
reignited the debate about the role of climate change on altering 
weather patterns.

In a 
speech to Institute for Public Policy Research, Mr Davey insisted the 
disaster that has befallen much of England demonstrates ‘the possible 
consequences of a world in which extreme weather events are much more 
likely’.

Mr Davey said 
climate change denial and Euro-scepticism are a ‘diabolical cocktail’ 
that threatens efforts to tackle global warming.

The
 attempt to exploit the flooding crisis to attack the Tories came as 
David Cameron came under pressure over his ‘money is no object’ pledge 
on aiding victims.

But Mr 
Fallon, the junior Tory minister in Mr Davey’s department, condemned the
 outburst by his boss. He told the Standard: ‘This is not a time for 
Coalition squabbling. We should all be focusing on getting people’s 
power back on and protecting the sub stations that are in danger of 
being flooded.

Lord Lawson claimed there was no evidence linking the floods to climate change

‘Unthinking 
climate change worship has damaged British industry and put up consumer 
bills.

'It’s David Cameron who is cutting green taxes and steering Europe
 away from artificial targets.’

Mr
 Davey’s intervention will be seen as an attack on Environment Secretary
 Owen Paterson in particular, who harbours doubts about the degree to 
which man has contributed to global warming.

Mr
 Davey added: ‘From the right, fringes of the Conservative Party and 
Ukip are parroting the arguments of the most discredited climate change 
deniers – seizing on any anomaly in the climate data to attempt to 
discredit the whole.

‘This 
is undermining public trust in the scientific evidence for climate 
change – overwhelming though it is. And we can see around us today the 
possible consequences of a world in which extreme weather events are 
much more likely. This type of climate change denying conservatism is 
wilfully ignorant, head in the sand, nimbyist conservatism.

‘And
 when married to the europhobia innate to parts of the Conservative 
Party, you have a diabolical cocktail that threatens the whole long-term
 structure of UK climate change and energy policy.

'If you accept the logic of climate change, you have to accept the logic of European co-operation to tackle it.’

He
 was backed by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who said: ‘It’s not a 
secret that in the Conservative Party you’ve got a fair number of people
 who just don’t accept the reality of climate change.’

Speaking
 on his weekly radio phone-in, the Lib Dem minister told LBC 97.3: 
‘These very violent and volatile weather patterns are linked in some 
shape or form to climate change. 

‘Other
 people are entitled to say, no we think it’s all baloney, but I think 
at a certain point you’ve just got to say, look come on, how many more 
times do you need to be told by people who know what they’re talking 
about that this happening, and we’ve got to do something about it.’

Former
 Conservative Chancellor Lord Lawson insisted there was no evidence that
 extreme weather was linked to climate change, and urged scientists to 
admit they did not know what was happening.

He
 told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I think we want to focus not on 
this extremely speculative and uncertain area. I don’t blame the climate
 scientists for not knowing.

'Climate
 and weather is quite extraordinarily complex and this is a very new 
form of science. All I blame them for is pretending they know when they 
don’t.'

He said the 
government should focus on how to prepare the nation to cope with 
extreme weather instead of trying to tackle climate change.

'I
 think this is a wake-up call. We need to abandon this crazy and costly 
policy of spending untold millions on littering the countryside with 
useless wind turbines and solar panels and moving from a sensible energy
 policy of having cheap and reliable forms of energy to a policy of 
having unreliable and costly energy – give up that.

'What
 we want to focus on, it’s very important, is making sure this country 
is really resilient and robust to whatever nature throws at us, whether 
there’s a climate element or not.

'Water storage if there is a drought; flood defences, sea defences – that’s what we want to focus on.'
