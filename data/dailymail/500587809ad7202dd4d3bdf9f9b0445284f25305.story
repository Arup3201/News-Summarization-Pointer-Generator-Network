Fancy a rat kebab?

It's rat hunting season in Vietnam which means skewered vermin are back on the menu at a restaurant in Dan Phuong on the outskirts of the Vietnamese captial Hanoi.

Rat meat has been considered a delicacy for many years in southern areas of the south Asian country, and the taste for it is spreading.

Previously only eaten regularly by the northern Red River delta and southern Mekong River delta people, the taste for rat meat is spreading.

At this time of year, when rice is harvested, farmers in the south turn to rat hunting to capture the small animals for sale in markets

In the southern Mekong delta, hunting is particularly productive during the flood season when rats try to escape from their flooded hearths.

One kilogram of rat meat costs around 100,000 dong, or $4 to $5.
