Fast food restaurants are no strangers to criticism but being blasted for a lack of choice is not one of them.

However, never let it be said that they don't cover their backs, with bosses coming up with a way to satisfy the neediest of customers a long time ago.

For people unable to find a calorific fix in the regular choices, those in the know can take their pick from a rather special secret menu, and thanks to website Hack the Menu, less informed fast food lovers can now enjoy the same off-the-track treats.

Hack the Menu claims to reveal all the secret menu items at the world's biggest fast food chains

Describing
 itself as 'the ultimate and complete Secret Menu resource', Hack the 
Menu covers global giants such as Burger King, McDonalds, Subway and KFC
 - albeit, only at their US outlets.

The
 items listed in the site's directory include both the officially 
unofficial creations of the restaurant's themselves and also DIY 
inventions you can either make yourself, by combining several 
conventional orders, or convince a particularly game cashier to whip up.

A spokeswoman for Burger King denied having a secret menu and said 'Our restaurants are committed to providing our guests with choice, and all customers are able to customize their order, by adding ingredients to our menu offerings.'

Subway claimed the same. A spokeswoman for the brand said: 'All Subway stores are independently owned and operated by franchisees. Whilst we only have one core menu, the Subway brand prides itself on offering choice to customers so that they can have their Sub made the way they like it.'

Burger King

The Suicide Burger - Hack
 the Menu lists eight under-the-radar treats for Burger King but, at a 
fast food joint famed for its liberal use of cheese and bacon, the 
Suicide Burger is the stand out, with its four beef burgers, four slices
 of cheese and four rashers of bacon crammed between two buns.

The
 site claims the burger is available at all outlets - although sometimes
 under the name The Quadstack - for $3.99. However, in the event that a 
cashier stares blankly after receiving the order, customers are advised 
to simply describe it ingredient by ingredient.

The Suicide Burger - sometimes called the Quadstack - is available at Burger King across the United States

The Veggie Whopper - Just because someone doesn't eat meat, that doesn't mean they don't want to cram their face with insane amounts of food.

It goes with the name that Burger King has a carnivorous bent to its offerings, but with its pièce de résistance - The Whopper - bosses obviously didn't want vegetarians to miss out.

To
 this end, the BK secret menu contains a veggie-friendly version of the 
flagship burger, with the normal beef patty replaced with a non-meat 
alternative.

Frings
 - Less a new dish for culinary adventurers and more something for 
people who can't make decisions. This best-of-both-worlds alternative to
 chips sees half the fries dumped out of the carton and replaced with a 
side of onion rings.

Simple but effective, Hack the Menu describes Frings as 'the cherry on top of the Burger King Secret Menu'.

McDonalds

The Monster Mac - Perhaps
 more aptly called the Bigger Mac, this gut stretching creation is 
simply a normal Big Mac - but with six extra beef patties shoved in.

According
 to the Hack the Menu team, the burger is 'enough to satisfy a few 
people with hearty appetites or one hungry lumberjack' and can be 
ordered from any McDonalds for $6.49.

Root Beer Float -
 Ice cream floats are a highlight of everyone's childhood and this 
secret order from McDonalds allows you to update it for adulthood - by 
exchanging your soft drink of choice for root beer.

While obviously confined to those outlets which serve root beer, for only $1.99, it's a 'refreshing' desert to a Monster Mac.

McLeprechaun Shake
 - While fluorescent green is not usually the colour of choice for a 
tasty treat, that is the shade for this 50/50 mix of chocolate and 
shamrock milkshakes.

Only on
 offer in March - due to the availability of Shamrock Shakes - you will 
have to wait another year for what Hack the Menu calls 'the most famous'
 of McDonalds' secret offerings.

Starbucks

Liquid Cocaine - Not
 quite as illicit as the Class A drug but this drink is still a 
wink-wink, nudge-nudge purchase. This customer-invented beverage is 
supposedly 'one of the most intense drinks you can get, it's guaranteed 
to shock your system'.

Made 
up of four shots of espresso, four pumps of white chocolate syrup, ice 
and milk, the site suggests showing this recipe to your local barista as
 a how-to-guide.

Its DIY nature means there is no fixed price but the website said it should be standard for whatever size you order.

'One of the most intense drinks you can get': Made up of four shots of espresso, four pumps of white chocolate syrup, ice and milk

Twix Frappuccino -
 Coffee and chocolate, the two must haves for the harried officer worker
 rushing about their day. To that end, some Starbucks customers have 
come up with a new way of combining the two to make that commute even 
more efficient.

Made by 
mixing a Caramel Frappuccino with two pumps of caramel syrup, two pumps 
hazelnut syrup, java chips and caramel and mocha drizzle, customers will
 need to show his recipe to their cashier for a hope of walking away 
with the treat.

Three Cs Latte -
 Another customer creation, ask your barista to add one pump of caramel 
syrup and two pumps chocolate syrup to your Cinnamon Dolce Latte.

Hack
 the Menu is a big fan, claiming: 'In our opinion, the Three C's Latte 
from Starbucks' secret menu is the perfect cinnamon drink.'

Subway

Pizza Sub - While
 briefly on the main menu during 2012, the Pizza Sub has disappeared off
 the advertising boards to become a stalwart on the secret menu.

Essentially two Pepperoni Toasties stacked on top of each other, it's a product best aimed at the particularly hungry.

The price is variable between outlets, but Hack the Menu assures readers the 'taste sensation' is more than worth it.

Old Cut -
 Not in any way a new dish, it is, in fact, the old way Subway used to 
cut their sandwiches. At some point over the last decade, the policy 
somehow changed from cutting down from the top to cutting in from the 
side.

The Hack the Menu team
 suggest finding an artisan familiar with the old style as a top-down 
cut somehow helps the sandwich hold onto the ingredients better.

Wing Effect -
 Again a change in presentation rather than content. This is for people 
who like to go at their sandwich one ingredient at a time. Simply ask 
your sandwich maker to leave the meat closer to the edge of the bread, 
so it hangs out the side, and voila - wing effect.

KFC

Triple Down - Strictly
 for an American audience, the Triple Down is a riff on the infamous 
Double Down, which was released in US outlets in 2010.

It is a double-decker egg, bacon and cheese sandwich, but, instead of bread, the filling is sandwiched between fried chicken.

Hack
 the Menu warns: 'Not too many people are willing to try something this 
big, but don't be afraid to ask them for this behemoth if you're really 
hungry'.

While the Double 
Down is no longer available, the Hack the Menu team assure readers that 
if they ask nicely, its larger cousin can still be whipped up (for a 
variable cost).

Even though the Double Down has been taken off the menu, the Triple Down is supposedly still available

Poutine -
 A favourite in Canada, some US branches will also whip up customers a 
portion. Simply a portion of fries covered in cheese and gravy, all 
outlets should have the requisite ingredients for other dishes and are 
happy to help out a curious customer.

In-N-Out

Animal Style Fries - Chips covered in onions, pickles and melted cheese - Animal Style Fries are so popular they may as well appear on the regular menu. 'Pure goodness' according to Hack the Menu.

Animal Style Fries are the most popular item on the In-N-Out secret menu

Chipotle

Quesarito - Supposedly the 'Holy Grail' of the Mexican restaurant's secret menu, this is a burrito where, instead of a normal wrap, the fillings are packed into two tortillas fused together by melted cheese.

Hack the Menu says: 'Without a doubt, eating the Chipotle Quesarito is a life changer'.
