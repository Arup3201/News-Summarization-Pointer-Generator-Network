By the time most people get to the end of the John Lewis Christmas ad about the little boy and Monty, his lovelorn penguin, they are wiping the tears from their eyes or launching into a ‘Bah, humbug!’ tirade about the commercialisation of Christmas. But not me.

As the heart-tugging music swelled and Monty got a girlfriend, there was only one thought going through my head: I cannot believe how lifelike they made this penguin.

No doubt many of you thought the same, but I was prepared to be a harsh critic. For not only am I an experienced producer of wildlife documentaries, but it was my company that made last year’s BBC1 documentary series, Penguins: Spy In The Huddle.

Adorable: Sam (Rhys Edwards) feeds Monty in John Lewis advert, where the penguin is unbelievably realistic

Adelie penguins in the wild - the males aren't as romantic as they have been portrayed in the advert and typically will have a different mate every year

After a year of filming, 1,000 hours of footage and months of editing, I know Adelie penguins better than most and Monty, an Adelie created by computerised special effects, is astonishingly true to life.

The creative team have clearly done their research, impressively capturing the character and behavioural patterns that make the Adelie — with that white circle around those mournful eyes — one of the most lovable species of penguin.

But though Adelies may be adorable, they are hardly the romantic gentlemen that John Lewis would have us believe. In fact, they are incorrigible philanderers. But more of that later.

I first came across them when we were filming Emperor penguins for Spy In The Huddle, a series that made extensive use of hidden and, we like to think, cunningly camouflaged cameras. We had them hidden in fake penguins, fake chicks, fake lumps of ice, even fake eggs.

Today, I’m delighted to say our minimally invasive approach is being used by zoologists working in Antarctica. But it also produced, for us, some extraordinary footage of what life for penguins is really like in the harsh polar environment — particularly when Emperor penguins come into contact with their much smaller cousins, the Adelies.

The two species are the only ones to nest solely on the Antarctic continent, the Emperors toughing it out on nests through the winter while the Adelies (a French colleague of British adventurer Captain Scott named them after his wife) nest during the summer.

After looking for love, Monty is given the best Christmas gift he could have hoped for when Sam brings him a female penguin 

But they use the same breeding grounds, which can lead to clashes in spring when the Adelies arrive and discover the Emperors haven’t left yet.

The sight of bossy Adelies energetically trying to shoo away Emperor chicks almost twice their size provided one of the unexpected comic highlights of the series. At the risk of anthropomorphising, it’s almost as if they are natural performers.

That’s why I have a film crew in Antarctica — in a region that really is called Adelieland — filming Adelie penguins for a BBC1 Christmas special. That’s Christmas 2015, I hasten to add.

The Adelie — which, while declining in numbers, is one of the least endangered penguin species — seems to encapsulate what we love about penguins.

They come ready-dressed in their comedy dinner suits, that ungainly waddle on land raises a smile and they have the cutest, fluffiest chicks — three reasons why they have emerged as the stars of popular Hollywood films such as Happy Feet, Mr Popper’s Penguins and the Madagascar cartoon franchise — the latest spin-off of which, Penguins Of Madagascar, is released next month.

But we also admire how they battle against one of the harshest environments on Earth, surviving not just the extraordinary cold, but an array of predators such as the leopard seal and killer whale.

And no penguin species is braver than the Adelie.

Another of my favourite pieces of footage from Spy In The Huddle involves a huge seabird, a giant petrel, mounting an attack on a group of Emperor penguin chicks, only to be seen off by a small but feisty Adelie.

He’s not even protecting his own species, for goodness’ sake, but the brave Adelie stands up for them as if they were his own. Or, indeed, her own; you have to get very close to an Adelie to determine its sex.

At the end of the two minute commercial it's revealed that Sam had been playing with a cuddly toy and not, as portrayed, a live penguin 

The detail in the John Lewis ad is so impressive. Playing football like Monty might be a bit of stretch, but Adelie penguins are accomplished walkers, often having to cover distances of up to 30 miles between their nesting grounds and the open sea where they go to feed. And, as the ad correctly shows, Adelies discovered long ago that if you come across an ice-covered downward slope then it’s far more efficient — and looks a lot more fun — to slide down it on your conveniently prominent belly.

There are two more sequences in the ad I particularly like. One is when Monty pops vertically out of a park lake to land on the path next to his young owner. In the wild, Adelies have to reach underwater speeds of up to 30 miles an hour to achieve the vertical lift that sees them leaping straight out of the freezing sea and onto the ice.

Normally they get the speed and angles just right, which, together with super-grippy feet, makes for an impressive, gravity-defying exit.

But when they get it wrong, as they do occasionally, the result is comedy somersaults, back flips and their fellow penguins being knocked over like skittles.

My favourite moment in the ad, however, comes when Monty takes a toy brick from the playbox and passes it in his beak to the boy.

In an environment as tough as the Antarctic, where the chances of a fully grown bird surviving from one year to the next are slim, it makes little sense to mate for life 

If Adelies are known for anything, it’s for building their nests out of pebbles, raising them above the ice so when the ice melts during the brief Antarctic summer, the eggs don’t become waterlogged.

It’s that toy brick, rather than the soppy ending, that will draw a tear from anyone who knows their penguins.

But while they have got most things right, the team behind the John Lewis ad made one mistake, or at least glossed over a distinctly unseasonal truth.

As you listen to Tom Odell warbling his way through John Lennon’s Real Love and Monty stares balefully at one romantic couple after another, yearning for a girl of his own, you might imagine that Adelies were swan-like in their lifelong devotion to their mate.

Far from it. They may be into sexual equality when it comes to dividing up domestic duties, sharing the feeding, nest-sitting and chick-raising between male and female, but they are surprisingly pragmatic when it comes to love, or rather, sex.

In an environment as tough as the Antarctic, where the chances of a fully grown bird surviving from one year to the next are slim, it makes little sense to mate for life.

If no willing female is to be found, frustrated male Adelie penguins will resort to chasing vigorously after other males and even, I’m afraid to say, attempting to mate with dead penguins

Some penguins, such as Rockhoppers, practise monogamy, but for Adelies it’s a different mate every year.

Each spring the male Adelie builds his pebbly nest — often stealing from his neighbour for raw materials — in the hope of attracting a female.

But if he doesn’t, the mating instinct can prove overwhelming, a fact that led one of the first scientific papers on the species to be withheld from publication in the prudish early years of the last century.

For if no willing female is to be found, frustrated male Adelie penguins will resort to chasing vigorously after other males and even, I’m afraid to say, attempting to mate with dead penguins.

In these more enlightened times, not many would bat an eye over gay penguins. But necrophiliac penguins?

Sorry, Monty, that’s not real love, but it is real penguin life. Just don’t tell John Lewis.
