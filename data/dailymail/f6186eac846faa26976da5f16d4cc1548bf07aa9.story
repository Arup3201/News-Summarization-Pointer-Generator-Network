Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg enjoyed a beer sample as he toured the exhibition stands at the Liberal Democrat Autumn conference in Glasgow today.

Meanwhile, several delegates were pictured dozing as Lib Dem Pensions Minister Steve Webb gave a talk.

Mr Webb blasted Chancellor George Osborne for targeting the 'poorest people in the land'.

Cheers: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg tastes some beer as he tours the exhibition stands at the Liberal Democrat Autumn conference in Glasgow today

Drowning your sorrows? Clegg's party is languishing on just six per cent in the polls

Steve Webb drew pantomime boos from activists at the second time of asking after insisting he agreed with '2012 George but not with 2014 George' for seemingly reneging on his vow not to 'balance the budget on the backs of the poor'. 

Clegg also tried on a pair of hi-tech Google glasses - and the first thing the head-mounted computer told him was that his beloved Arsenal were losing.

The Deputy Prime Minister visibly flinched as the Google Glass, which projects information onto a display in front of the wearer's eye, informed him that Diego Costa had just put Chelsea 2-0 ahead in their Premier League clash with the Gunners.

Mr Clegg was offered a go on the device as he visited the tech giant's exhibition stall at the Liberal Democrat conference in Glasgow, where he was also shown an Android watch.

He initially looked intrigued when he saw the football score flash up, but his interest turned to horror as it was updated seconds later.

'Oh look, Chelsea-Arsenal, one-nil to Chelsea,' said the Liberal Democrat leader, before throwing his hands up and shouting: 'No! Oh no! Another goal. Who scored?'

After being told that the Glass retails at £1,000, Mr Clegg jokily pretended to slip away with the device still on his face.

Meanwhile Lib Dem president Tim Farron accused the Conservatives of being 'borderline immoral' and suggested the Lib Dems would work with the biggest party in the event of a hung parliament.

He told Murnaghan on Sky News: 'It's very important that people know a Conservative only government would be lacking in compassion. They are indeed the nasty party that Theresa May said they were.

'They are trying to balance the books on the backs of the poor, something which is un-British and borderline immoral.

'And the Labour party if they were allowed to govern on their own would be the incompetent rabble they were that got us into this mess in the first place.'

He added: 'What happens after May next year? Well we are going to have to live with it. Whatever the outcome is we will be big enough and grown up enough to work with whoever it is the electorate say we must work with.'

Mr Farron claimed the Prime Minister misled the Lib Dems during the coalition negotiations.

'Undoubtedly David Cameron pretended to be green, pretended to care about civil liberties, pretended to care about people who are less fortunate than himself and I'm afraid we've been shown none of those things were true.'

Schools minister David Laws told BBC1's Sunday Politics the Lib Dems would not oust Mr Clegg if one of the other parties demanded his removal as part of any coalition deal.

'We are not having some other party tell us who our leader is. Nobody is going to dictate to the Liberal Democrats who leads the party. We will decide that ourselves and we have decided that.'

Asked about polling for the programme that showed only one third of Lib Dem candidates were planning to put Mr Clegg on their election leaflets, he said: 'From real candidates who are going out now ... we are delighted to put Nick Clegg on our leaflets, we are very proud of what he has done in government.'
