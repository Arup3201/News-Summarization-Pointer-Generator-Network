She's been linked to a string of eligible bachelors since splitting from her long-term boyfriend, Alex Loudon, last year.

But Pippa Middleton has now been pictured on a 'date' with James Matthews, the wealthy investment banker brother of Made In Chelsea star Spencer Matthews.

The 37-year-old seemed to be the perfect gentleman as he helped the sister of the Duchess of Cambridge into a cab following a night out at an exclusive London restaurant earlier this month.

And Pippa, 29, certainly seemed to have dressed up for the occasion, looking chic and stylish in a black shift dress and lace-detail jacket. 

Meanwhile, James looked smart as he held the door open for his friend wearing a tailored black jacket, a white shirt and jeans.

Friends of the rumoured couple have claimed their relationship is going from 'strength to strength' following a string of dates.

The pair were first spotted having dinner at the Queen's Club tennis centre in West London and nine days ago they dined out at the fashionable Hakkasan restaurant, where onlookers said they were 'openly flirting' as they shared a bottle of wine in a 'secluded booth'.

A source told the Sunday Mirror newspaper: 'They were deep in conversation and only had eyes for each other. Pippa was all smiles and kept giggling.

'They stayed for nearly three hours and didn't seem to want the meal to end.'

James a former Eton pupil, is chief executive of Eden Rock Capital Management Group, which he set-up more than 10 years ago.

His brother Spencer, 24, has starred in E4's Made In Chelsea reality show since it first aired last year and their parents, David and Jane, bought Eden Rock, a luxury hotel in the Caribbean, in 1995.

Pippa split from her long-term boyfriend of 
three-years, City banker Alex Loudon, in 2011.

She has since been linked with the Duke of Northumberland's son, George Percy, 28, a friend from her time as a student at Edinburgh University.

A friend of Pippa's added: 'Pippa is quite taken with James. She wants to take things slowly at first but she she is ready for a full-time man in her life again.'

Pippa was embroiled in controversy earlier this year when she was pictured laughing in a car as a man brandished what appeared to be a gun at photographers in Paris.

She was in France for an 18th Century-themed ball, which was also attended by a stripper, a dwarf and people in bondage gear.

Last week, she launched a party guide, Celebrate: A Year of British Festivities for Families and Friends, having been paid a £400,000 advance to pen the book.
