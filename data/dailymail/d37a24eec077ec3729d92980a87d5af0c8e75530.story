Environmental campaigns have maintained for years that sonar systems used by shipping leads to the stranding of whales.

But now international research has confirmed their concerns for the first time that whales strand themselves on beaches when they are lost and disorientated by high-frequency underwater noise.

An independent scientific review panel 
found the systems, mainly used for underwater mapping, were responsible 
for the mass stranding of 100 melon-headed whales in Madagascar in 2008.

A recent study by the Cascadia Research Collective based in Washington, said underwater military sonar could be killing blue whales.

The reserachers said  that baleen whale species, which include the world’s largest animal, the blue whale, react to the mid frequency noises by changing behaviour.

This includes altering foraging so they miss out on high-quality prey, which could make them weak and decimate numbers through starvation.

The soundwaves, developed by the military to track enemies beneath the waves, are between 1 and 10 kHz, which is within the human hearing band.

They have been blamed for lethal mass stranding of deep diving toothed whales.

Sonar is thought to disrupt the animals’ diving behaviour so much  that they suffer a condition rather like ‘the bends’ which human divers can contract if they surface too quickly.This research claims that sonar can significantly disrupt their foraging and dramatically decrease feeding efficiency as undersea noise blocks animals’ communication.

Teams from the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) were able to rescue some of the whales, but it was too late for many of them.

While aspects of the stranding in Madagascar remain unknown, the panel concluded that a multi-beam echosounder system, operated intermittently by a survey vessel moving down the shelf-break the day before the event was the most 'plausible and likely behavioral trigger for the animals initially entering the lagoon system.'

There are now concerns about the impact of noise on marine mammals as the systems are commonly used by many industries.

A report commissioned by the panel said: 'The potential for behavioural responses and indirect injury or mortality from the use of similar MBES [multi-beam echosounder systems] should be considered in future environmental assessments, operational planning and regulatory decisions.'

The noise from the high-frequency sonar 
systems, used by the military, shipping and research vessels, can cause 
the animals to swim into the wrong areas, and it is thought that use of the system leads to beachings in the UK too.

Every year 800 whales, dolphins and porpoises are stranded on British beaches, although it is not known whether sonar systems are to blame. Here, British Divers Marine Life Rescue volunteers inspect a with a 44ft Sperm whale, which died on Redcar beach in Cleveland in 2011

Dr Howard Rosenbaum, director of the Ocean Giants Program for WCS, welcomed the report and said: 'These conclusions add to a mounting body of evidence of the potential impacts of anthropogenic noise on marine mammals.

'Implications go well beyond industry, as these sonar systems are widely used aboard military and research vessels for generating more precise bathymetry (underwater mapping).

'We now hope that these results will be used by industry, regulatory authorities and others to minimise risks and to better protect marine life, especially marine mammal species that are particularly sensitive to increasing ocean noise from human activities.'

Katie Moore, director of animal rescue at IFAW said: 'Mass stranding response is challenging under the best of circumstances.

'Together with local individuals and the government of Madagascar, we provided the expertise to rescue as many animals as possible and medical care to those that stranded alive.

'Equally important was to gather as much data as possible from the animals to address the root cause of the stranding. We are pleased to see the ISRP report and its conclusions, which will hopefully be used in shaping future conservation policies.'
