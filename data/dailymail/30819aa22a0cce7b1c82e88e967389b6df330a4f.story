Kate Upton appears to be modeling for Victoria's Secret, just over a year after the casting director for the lingerie giant's catwalk shows said she 'would never use [her].'

In an image obtained by Buzzfeed of the back of the newest Victoria's Secret catalog, the model, 20, is seen wearing a black Body by Victoria bra.

It comes as some surprise to see her posing for the brand, given that she was the subject of some scathing comments from its model booker, Sophia Neophitou, in a New York Times interview early last year.

Surprise appearance: In an image of the back of the new Victoria's Secret catalog, Kate Upton is seen posing in a black bra. It comes just over a year after the lingerie giant's casting director called her look 'too obvious'

Ms Neophitou told the paper that she would never book Miss Upton for the Victoria's Secret catwalk show.

'She is too obvious. She’s like a page three girl.' she said. 'She’s like a footballer’s wife, with the too-blond hair and the kind of face that anyone with enough money can go out and buy.'

Ms Neophitou appears to be alone in her opinion of Miss Upton though. The model, who shot to fame after landing the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue in 2012, has become the darling of the fashion set.

In just under 18 months, she has appeared on three Vogue covers, fronted the inaugural issue of CR Fashion Book, and posed in photo shoots for V Magazine, Terry Richardson and Harper's Bazaar.

She has also attended the Met Gala and modeled in campaigns for Sam Edelman and Mercedes Benz.

And she still remains in favor with Sports Illustrated, who chose her for yet another Swimsuit Issue cover this year.

But while Miss Upton has never been an official Angel, it would seem that she has maintained a relationship with Victoria's Secret since her teens.

Buzzfeed reveals that she modeled 
pajamas for the brand back in 2011, when she would have been about 18, 
well before her Sports Illustrated fame.

But the site's Amy O'Dell explains that a model's presence in the catalog does not automatically qualify her for the runway show.

'Casting for the catalog and fashion show are seen as two very different things to the fashion community,' she said. 'There’s a lot of cross-over but it’s not a fully symbiotic relationship.'

MailOnline reached out to Victoria's Secret to determine the nature of Miss Upton's apparent new role, but is yet to get a response.
