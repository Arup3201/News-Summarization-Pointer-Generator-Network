Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert expects new signing Joe
Cole to be fit and ready for the start of the Premier League season despite a
setback.

The former England international, who arrived at Villa Park
as a free agent last month, picked up a thigh injury last week in a friendly
against Mansfield.

Consequently Cole sat out Wednesday’s 2-0 victory over MLS
team Dallas and faces a race against time to get match fit for the season opener.

Still got it? Joe Cole (centre right) joined Villa from West Ham this summer but is injured again

However, Lambert is confident the 32-year-old midfielder,
who has been hit with injuries in recent years, will be ready to make his
competitive Villa debut when they begin their campaign against Stoke on August
16

‘Joe has a little knock on his thigh. It's a minor knock,’
Lambert told Villa's official website.

‘He will be touch and go for Saturday. I won't rush him.

‘But I am not too concerned. I think Joe will be fine for
the first day.’

Fresh start: The former England midfielder has been plagued with injuries in recent campaigns at Liverpool and West Ham but will hope his luck has changed

Retrun: N'Zogbia has been out for a full season but has returned to pre season in fine form for Villa

Lambert will be boosted by the return of winger Charles N’Zogbia,
who has missed an entire season due to a serious achilles injury.

N’Zogbia marked his return to the first team by scoring a
spectacular free-kick against Dallas.

‘It is great to see Charles come back after a lengthy spell
out - it was a bad injury,’ said Lambert.

‘He's come back in pre-season looking pretty sharp. If he
can stay injury-free, hopefully he will have a big season.

‘Overall his contribution since he's been back has been
very, very good. His goal was excellent. To come back the way he has is very
pleasing.’
