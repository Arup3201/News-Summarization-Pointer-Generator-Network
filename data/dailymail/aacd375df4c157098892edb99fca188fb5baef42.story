Frank Lampard was included on the list of players who have been released by their clubs at the end of the Premier League season, despite the England player's uncertain future.

Lampard was joined by former England team-mates Gareth Barry, Rio Ferdinand, Ashley Cole, Joleon Lescott and Joe Cole, whilst home-town hero Shola Ameobi was released by Newcastle.

However, the list is not yet definitive - according to the Premier League even players listed as free transfers could continue at their clubs next season.

Over and out? Lampard is on the free transfer list but could still be offered a new deal by Chelsea

Lampard is yet to be offered a contract by Chelsea, but it is understood that Jose Mourinho would like him to join John Terry in signing a new deal.

There appears to be less hope for the other players on the Chelsea list, including Samuel Eto'o and Ashley Cole, who confirmed on twitter last week that he would be leaving the club.

Manchester United defensive duo Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic made their exits known long before the list was published, with the latter to join Inter Milan this summer, and are joined by Ryan Giggs, who announced his retirement last week.

Arsenal duo Bacary Sagna and Lukas Fabianski do not appear on the list, as they are still considering offers from the club, but both are expected to leave shortly.

They are likely to follow striking flops Niklas Bendtner and Park Chu Young out of the door at the Emirates.

Sagna has been offered £150,000-a-week by champions Manchester City and could join the club this week.

Tony Pulis' Crystal Palace have declined to offer contracts to fifteen players, including several who played a significant part this season. Moroccan striker Marouane Chamakh, and defenders Jonathan Parr, Danny Gabidon and Kagisho Dikgacoi all appear to be on the way out.

Relegated Fulham also released fifteen players, inlcuding top scorer Steve Sidwell and fullback John Arne Riise.

Elsewhere in the Premier League Hull City relesed their club captain Robert Koren, along with FA Cup final starter Matt Fryatt.

West Brom confirmed the release of Uruguay captain Diego Lugano, as well as Zoltan Gera and Lima Ridgewell.
