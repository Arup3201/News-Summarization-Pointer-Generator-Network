April will be welcomed in with rain and heavy winds battering most of the country this week.

And those preparing themselves for a sunny Easter may be sorely disappointed as the clouds are not expected to lift by next weekend.

There was chaos in parts of the UK today with gale-force winds causing trees to fall on tracks and trains to be severely delayed in the West Country.

Workmen were called to clear the blockage on the railway track between Exeter in Devon and Taunton in Somerset.

Elsewhere in Devon, gale-force winds also caused ferry services in Torbay to be cancelled over safety concerns for passengers.

The conditions saw the school holidays get off to a gloomy start, and forecasters said the unsettled weather will continue for much of the week.

The Met Office issued a yellow weather warning for ice across the North West of England and Scotland for today and tomorrow.

And a League Two football match between Bury and Southend United was called off after just six minutes on Saturday after rain soaked the pitch.

Meanwhile 71mph gales struck Scotland - with temperatures in Finnart, near Gare Loch, plummeting to -1C (30.2F) yesterday.

But Coningsby in Lincolnshire saw 16C (60.8F) yesterday, while the UK high today was Marham in Norfolk was 14C (57.2F).

Temperatures across Britain this week are expected to average between 10C (50F) and 12C (53.6F) with high winds and hail anticipated on Tuesday. 

Spirits may lift for the South on Wednesday with some sun expected - but the clouds will return again by Thursday, when rain is also expected to fall.

And with travel woe predicted on the roads and railways as 16 million people take to their cars, it could make for a miserable holiday getaway.

At the same time last year, temperatures soared to 20C (60F) in some parts of the South East.

Charlie Powell, a forecaster for the Met Office told the Daily Mail: ‘Through the week there will be a general improvement.

‘It looks like the wind will clear by the Easter weekend. Sunshine I would be less confident about.

'But we’ve got unsettled weather to come over the next few days.’

Mr Powell added: ‘Last April, it was a nice first week on the whole. Across some parts of the south east it got to 20C - so pretty warm.’

And the dreary weather will not be the only dampener on the Easter weekend.

Trains over the Easter period will be severely disrupted with work planned between London and Watford and the route between Paddington and Didcot.

Routes between London and the west Midlands as well as Penrith and Preston will also be affected.
