Man's greatest invention may not have been fire or the wheel - but a toothbrush made of twigs.

According to new research by Spanish scientists prehistoric man had discovered that using a mixture of frayed and sharpened sticks to clean his teeth after a meal gave him healthy gnashers long after other animals had lost theirs to decay.

It was the start of man's ability to live longer than other members of the animal kingdom, giving him time in which he could learn and invent, thus laying the foundations for modern civilisation.

By gum! The primitive toothbrush was used to clean the teeth of food after meals, and also kept gums healthy be regular grooming

The groundbreaking discovery was made by scientists at the Catalan Institute of Human Palaeoecology and Social Evolution in collaboration with the University Autonoma of Bellaterra and the Council of Valencia.

They found that the primitive toothbrush was not only used to clean food from between teeth after meals but, in doing so, made for healthier gums and therefore a longer life.

They worked out the regularity with which prehistoric man used the rudimentary toothbrush by  tracing the marks made by the wood on the teeth of various jawbones from throughout the ages.

For tooth! The regular cleaning using sticks was demonstrated by the marks the wood made on the teeth meaning healthy teeth for longer, and that meant longer life, said researchers

Earliest evidence of the removal of food debris from between teeth was found by the team in 'Homo habilis', who lived between 1.9 and 1.6 million year ago.

The latest research made in fossil remains of Neanderthals shows that sticks were also used to  'ease the pain ' caused by several oral diseases.

The researchers published an article in the journal Plos One, 'Toothpicking and periodontal disease in a Neanderthal specimen from Cova Forada of Valencia '.

As well as Homo habilis, the scientists studied fossil remains 
of a person who lived between 150,000 and 50,000 years ago and found 
that, despite heavy wear, he had no cavities.

They
believe he had used a stick several times a day to relieve the 
discomfort that an unknown periodontal disease caused him, resulting in 
two grooves on the contact between two teeth.

Use of sticks in ancient species is widely documented, but this is the first time it's been shown to have been used for toothache and for dental hygiene.
