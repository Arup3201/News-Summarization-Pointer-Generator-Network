A devoted mother and her three young children have been killed after a fire ripped through the family's mobile home in Maine, police have said. 

The bodies of Norma Skidgel, 28, her  three-year-old son, Trenton Delisle, and two-year-old twins, Mason and Madison Delisle, and were found  in a back bedroom of the trailer in Caribou this morning.

Investigators are still searching for a cause of the fire, but they said a fire alarm was found in the home with its batteries removed.

The four bodies will be transported to the state medical examiner for an autopsy that will likely take place today.

Heart-breaking: Ms Skidgel's two-year-old twins, Mason and Madison Delisle (above), were also killed in the blaze

Destroyed: Investigators are still searching for a cause of the fire, but they said a fire alarm was found in the home with its batteries removed

Investigators say the family shared the home with Ms Skidgel's sister, Amy Bouchard and her two sons.

Ms Bouchard was out walking with one of her sons when the blaze erupted, The Press Herald reported, and returned home to find the trailer on fire. She rushed into the burning trailer in a desperate bid to save her sister and nephews, but was unable to reach them, according to reports. She is being treated in hospital for smoke inhalation.

In a poignant and tragic last post on Facebook five days before she died, stay-at-home mother Ms Skidgel shared an image of a lit candle with the words, 'Share this candle of Love if you miss someone in Heaven above. Gone, but never forgotten.'

And today, tributes  to the 'caring' mother and her three 'precious babies' began pouring in on social media.

James Ballantyne wrote on Facebook: 'Rip GIRL norma and her babies didnt deserve that!!!!!!!!!!!!! Alll she wanted was the best life for her children........

Travis Drake added: 'Rest in peace Norma Trenton, Madison and my sweet sweet little man mason. I'll love and miss you guys like crazy. To you Mason you will be with me and my heart to you ... I loved you like my own buddy.' 

A week before the tragedy, she posted photographs of herself strapping her children into a car alongside the caption: 'Fun fun ride to bangor at least they're having a gd time on such a long ride.'

Firefighters rushed into a burning mobile home in far northern Maine early Thursday but they were too late.

The blaze had torn through the home at about 7 a.m., state police said. The children were taken to a hospital where they were pronounced dead, while the woman died at the scene, police said.

Officials said the fire occurred in a mobile home park on the city's outskirts, about four miles from Aroostook National Wildlife Refuge.  The small park consists of three rows of trailers in a sparsely populated, rural area.

Happy family: Investigators say three other people also lived at the mobile home and one of them is being treated at a local hospital for smoke inhalation

Maine Public Safety Department spokesman Steven McCausland said 25 people have died in fires this year in the state, the most in 21 years. Fires killed 27 in 1993.

This month has been especially deadly for Maine fires — a fire November 1 in Portland claimed six lives and another this week killed a man in St. Francis in far northern Maine. The 11 fire fatalities in November have accounted for more in one month than occurred in all of 2010, when the state recorded nine fatalities, all-time low for the state. The worst year for fire deaths was 1967, when 70 people died from fires, McCausland said.

"It illustrates how quickly the death total can rise with a single fire and multiple victims," McCausland said.

State public health officials encouraged residents to make sure their homes have working smoke detectors and that families review fire escape route plans.

The cause of the fire was still under investigation.
