Footage emerged today showing South Korea's first successful satellite launch taken from a video camera fixed to the rocket as it blasted into space.

The handout video from the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) showed the entire process of the rocket entering orbit and releasing the satellite.

Wednesday's launch followed two failed attempts in 2009 and 2010 to launch a civilian rocket carrying a scientific satellite.

South Korea said the day after the launch the satellite had successfully made contact with the ground station.Â 

The country's Satellite Technology Research Centre at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) said the first communication contact was made at 3.27.12 am on Thursday.

South Korea already has satellites in space which have been launched from other countries.

The launch came at a time of tension 
resulting from North Korea's announcement that it would carry out more 
rocket launches and nuclear test after it was censured by the United 
Nations Security Council over the launch of a rocket in December.

The reclusive country declared a boycott of all dialogue aimed at ending its nuclear programme.

South Korea's U.N. ambassador said today a North Korean nuclear test 'seems to be imminent.'

Ambassador
Kim Sook said there are 'very busy activities' taking place at North 
Korea's nuclear test site 'and everybody's watching.'

Kim
told a press conference that in the event of a nuclear test, he expects
the U.N. Security Council to respond with 'firm and strong measures.'

North Korea announced last month that
it would conduct a nuclear test to protest Security Council sanctions 
toughened after a satellite launch in December that the U.S. and others 
say was a disguised test of banned missile technology.

The council ordered North Korea in the sanctions resolution to refrain from a nuclear test or face 'significant action.'

South Korea joined the Security Council in January and holds the rotating presidency this month. Kim said he was speaking as South Korea's ambassador, not as the council president.

He said that during negotiations on the latest sanctions resolution all 15 council members - including North Korean ally China - were unified.

'They are very firm and resolute and I would expect very firm and strong measures to be taken in terms of format as well as in substance once they go ahead with such provocation' as a nuclear test, Kim said.

Pyongyang's two previous nuclear tests, in 2006 and 2009, both occurred after it was condemned by the United Nations for rocket launches.

The sanctions, aimed at trying to derail the country's rogue nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, bar North Korea from testing or using nuclear or ballistic missile technology, and from importing or exporting material for these programs.

The latest sanctions resolution again demanded that North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons program and cease launches.

It slapped sanctions on North Korean companies and government agencies, including its space agency and several individuals.
