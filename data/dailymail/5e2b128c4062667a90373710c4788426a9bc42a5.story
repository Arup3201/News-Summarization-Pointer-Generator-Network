Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said today he intends to run for reelection next year in spite of a New Year's Day accident that left him with four broken ribs and severe damage to his right eye.

Reid will undergo surgery his eye next week. Today he revealed his eye is so weak he hasn't been able to read regularly and has instead had to listen to audio books.

'As some of you know, I'm an avid reader. Read lots and lots of books, even some good ones during the break,' Reid told reporters today during his first media availability since he was injured.

'I have not been able to read. They have told me if you have an eye that's healing and you try to overwork your good eye, it puts too much pressure on it.'

BACK ON HIS FEET: Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid arrives at a news conference today on Capitol Hill. Reid came back to work on Tuesday but didn't sit down with press until this afternoon

Reid will undergo surgery on his right eye next week. Today he revealed his eye is so weak he hasn't been able to read regularly since his New Year's Day accident and instead has had to listen to audio books

Reid said he's 'quite enjoyed' listening to audio books. 

'I never thought I would,' he added. 'So I've finished a couple books that way.'

'I spend a lot of time with my staff...on the telephone, I have staff meetings at my home,' he noted. 'My daughter's been visiting with me. I've got a son coming this weekend. So I'm doing fine.'

An avid exerciser, Reid suffered the eye injury as well as broken ribs when an exercise band he was using broke on Jan. 1 and sent him smashing into cabinets at his Nevada home.

The eye surgery is a 'necessary step to assist in recovering full vision', his office said, adding he was expected to be released from the Washington, D.C. hospital quickly following the operation.

Reid will need to remain at his D.C. home for several days to minimize strain on the injured eye. 

The Nevada senator told reporters today that during the procedure, doctors would remove a bone from his face so that they can drain the blood that's backed up around his eye.

'They’re going to have a reconstruction of that bone there,' he said, pointing to his face, according to Politico. 'They’re going to drain the blood off the front part of the eye, the back part of the eye. And they’re confident I’ll be really quite good about that.' 

Reid indicated that he may sue the maker of the exercise equipment he was using if he finds out it was defective.

'Let’s say if I were, I wouldn’t be broadcasting it,' he told reporters.

The 75-year-old was not in his office yesterday, although on Tuesday he made his first appearance in the Capitol since the accident.

Reid said doctors would 'drain the blood off the front part of the eye, the back part of the eye' in his surgery. 'And they’re confident I’ll be really quite good about that.'

The Nevada Democrat has said the injuries won't prevent him from running for a sixth term next year, and his office has worked hard to emphasize that he is continuing to work while he's been recuperating.

It released a photo of Reid meeting at his Washington home with other members of the Democratic leadership, the first week of the new Congress.

'I’ve been heavily involved in everything that’s gone on on the floor. There’s been no surprises for me,' Reid said today.

His office said in a statement announcing the eye surgery that 'he will continue to maintain a busy schedule next week as his right eye heals'.

Reid's office also posted a Twitter photo of him sitting at his desk in his Senate office on Tuesday. 

Today the Nevada senator affirmed that he would run for reelection in 2016. 

''We have quite an operation in Nevada that hasn’t lost a step. We’re off and running,' he said. 

'This question was asked before the break, and I’m answering it the same way. I plan on running.'

Reid was off crutches by today's press avail, though he said he's still taking Tylenol to help him cope with the pain.

Asked by a reporter how his ribs are, the former boxer said: 'How are my ribs? They’re so meaningless it’s hard to believe.'
