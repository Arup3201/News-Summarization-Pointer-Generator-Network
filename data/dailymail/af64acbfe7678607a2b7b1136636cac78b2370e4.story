Canadian high-school support worker Joel Robinson has turned a hobby into a money-spinning business.

Joel, 27, creates fantastical pictures using optical illusions to make himself look as tiny as possible.

Inspired by Vogue photographer Tim Walker's magical work Joel started taking pictures just for fun but his success rocketed after Coca-Cola spotted his work and started commissioning him.

The multinational drinks company discovered Joel's photos with seemingly giant Coca-Cola bottles on photo-sharing website Flickr, and then contacted him.

Joel fully credits the medium of social media for his exposure and success. Speaking exclusively to MailOnline, he said: 'Someone at the company must have come across them.’

While his day job involves working with pupils with learning difficulties in a Canadian high school, what started out as a hobby quickly turned into a supplementary business for Joel.

He has never studied photography but has loved drawing, painting, and all things art since he was 'a little kid'.

Joel had also never taken professional photographs before, and only bought an SLR camera five years ago to take while traveling around Canada.

The camera ‘only cost about $100 from eBay’ and his hobby ‘grew from there’.

He developed a strong interest and fascination with the tool and started experimenting with depths and illusions.

The fact that he incorporated a Coca-Cola bottle into some of his photographs was by chance.

'I posted a few photos where I had a coke bottle in them and Coca-Cola looked at them. This time last year they asked me if they could share them on Twitter,' he said.

‘About a month later, in February, they asked me to create images to go with a list of positive association words.

‘They created the list of words and asked me to create pictures for them. They were words like “share”, “giving”, and “be happy” – words that fit the brand.’

‘So far I’ve created about 30. They ask me to create a new one about every other week.’

He’s now working with the company on an ongoing social media based photography project.

Joel has also created book covers for publishing giant Random House who commissioned his work in 2011.

He mainly works with a Korean coffee magazine called Coffee Today, creating their coffee-themed covers for each issue.

The images shows in this article are mostly from a personal series, although a few of them, especially the coffee images, were created for his client Coffee Today.

‘I'm hoping to publish a book later this year with my images, including this series,’ he said.

‘Last year I started to push myself to become more business orientated: licensing more images and taking more commissions.’

‘Social networking is entirely how I’ve been able to make a business [of photography].’

His favourite photographers include Annie Liebowitz, Tim Walker, and Rodney Smith – influences which can be seen in his own work.

He has an online photography blog, Facebook page, Etsy shop, and Flickr page.
