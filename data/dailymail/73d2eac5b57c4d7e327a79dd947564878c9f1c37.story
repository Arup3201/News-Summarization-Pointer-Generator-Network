Police were left baffled today after discovering a badly decomposed body in woodlands at a golf course.

The mystery began when a woman dialled 999 to say her dog had emerged from trees at Meyrick Park, in Bournemouth, Dorset, with a human arm in its mouth.

The discovery sparked a massive police search but while officers were at the scene a man approached them with two human leg bones in a plastic bag.

The walker took police to the spot in 
the woods where he found them but when they looked up they found more 
human remains, believed to be a head, hanging from a tree.

A large part of exclusive Meyrick Park, Bournemouth, was sealed as forensic officers using specialist tracker dogs, searched for any more human remains.

However, their hunt was halted when a man aged in his 40s approached them clutching two more human bones in a clear plastic bag.

He told them he had found them previously, in the same woods - and handed them over to police officers who put them in evidence bags.

The man, who lives near the golf course but declined to give his name, said he had found the bones in the woods and had taken them home.

However, he was now not sure he had done the right thing so did not want to comment further.

A spokesman for Dorset Police said last night that officers had found 'additional human remains' in an inaccessible place, high up in a tree.

'They have been found high up in a tree.

The remains have not yet been identified,' the spokesman added.

It was believed all the bones relate to a person who hanged themselves in the top of the tree, possibly months ago.

As the body decomposed, the bones fell to the ground.

Teams of police forensic experts with tracker dogs were today working in a large sealed off section of Meyrick Park golf course in Bournemouth, Dorset.

A private ambulance was called to the scene to take the hand away to be examined at a hospital mortuary.

The golf club remained open to players who were stopped from using just one hole by blue and white police tape.

A spokesman for Dorset Police said a pathologist had confirmed the hand to be human, prompting a thorough search of the woodland with police sniffer dogs.

'It is being treated as unexplained and no arrests have been made,' said the spokesman.

She added that officers did not yet know whether it was an arm belonging to a man or a woman or how long it had been in the woodland.

It was described as being in 'fairly advanced' stage of decomposition.

The limb, which had been detached from just below the elbow, did not have any remnants of clothing or other type of covering on it, and had no distinguishing features. There were no rings on the fingers.

Files on missing people were also being examined for clues about who the arm belonged to.

The horrifying discovery was made yesterday afternoon.

'At 1.06pm officers received a report that human remains had been found on the Bournemouth and Meyrick Park Golf Club,' said the police spokesman.

'Further analysis of the object has confirmed that the item is decomposed human tissue.'

Residents living near to the golf course regularly walk their dogs on the land surrounding the holes and were stopped by the investigation.

One walker, who did not want to be named, said: 'Everyone who walks up here has said it’s an arm or a hand. It’s not very nice, it’s sad to think it’s been in that woodland without anyone knowing.'
