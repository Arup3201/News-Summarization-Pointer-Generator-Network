Huge, ugly and cluttered, it is almost the antithesis of Apple's iconic design style.

Apple has almost finished work on a massive solar farm next to its data centre in North Carolina, hoping to boost its green credentials - but scarring the landscape with a 100-acre eyesore at the same time.

Organisations such as Greenpeace have, 
in the past, accused Apple of hurting the environment by using coal to 
power these centres.

Apple's data centres keep the world's iPhones running - syncing contacts to the 'iCloud' and storing a wealth of information on each user.

Apple is just one of many companie pumping millions if not billions of dollars into data centres.

Google has spent $600million on a centre in Lenoir - about an hour's drive from Apple's centre in Maiden.

Drive for another hour, and you bump into Facebook's 300,000sq ft centre, in a place called Forest City.

It has led to large investment within the state, as well as offering jobs and opportunities.

According to ComputerWorld, the reason why 'NC' is such a popular spot lies partly down to it's strong electrical grid, and tax breaks.

Apple has allegedly received a 10-year 50 per cent break in real estate taxes and an 85 per cent break in personal property taxes.

The state also has a strong record for making quick decisions on permits - and plenty of room for expansion.

When completed, Appleâ€™s 100-acre, 
20-megawatt facility will supply 42 million kWh of energy annually, and 
is expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars to construct.

The area is also home to Facebook and Google data centers, attracted by the cheap power costs.

As reported by website GigaOm, the North Carolina TV station WCNC flew past the solar farm, taking these images and showing the scale of the farm.

Which means that every time you upload an image or make a pithy announcement of your life on Facebook, the servers in North Carolina are chugging away to ensure your messages get sent.

While sending messages around the 
world virtually might make more eco-sense than physically getting a 
plane to do it in person, critics, such as British site MusicTank, 
suggest the way we use clouds for our data may be more damaging to the 
environment.

Report author Dagfinn Bach said: 'Streaming
or downloading 12 tracks, without compression, just 27 times by one 
user would, in energy terms, equate to the production and shipping of 
one physical 12-track CD album'

Each
panel in the farm is installed on a tracker, which keeps everything 
pointing at the sun, scooping up as much of the Californian rays as 
possible.

Row after row: The solar farm keeps the iCloud alive for users, which follows protests from Greenpeace about previous non-ecological practices

Apple has been fairly quiet about the farm, but according to publications such as Wired and GigaOm, it is very close to completion.

The company also appears to building a 4.8-megawatt array of 'Bloom Energy' fuel cells, which convert bio-gas into electricity.

Other companies in California including Google, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft are also looking to combine data and solar power centres.

From 2007 to 2011, carbon emissions with the Apple TV were reduced by 90 per cent.

The iMac has also seen a 50 per cent reduction from 1998 to 2011, while the Mac mini has dropped 52 per cent.

Apple has also reduced the packaging associated with the iPhone by 42 per cent from 2007 to 2011.

That
allows the company to ship 80 per cent more boxes in each airline 
shipping container, saving one 747 flight for every 371,250 boxes Apple 
ships.
