Astronauts have fitted the first HD webcams to the International space station today following a tense spacewalk.

Oleg Kotov and Sergey Ryazanskiy were able to get both of the groundbreaking cameras working perfectly, unlike their first attempt where a spacewalk was abandoned.

People will be able to access the live footage on a website and the webcams could be used to provide high resolution imagery of the planet for environmental monitoring and to help with humanitarian relief efforts.

There are two cameras, the world's first 1-Metre 
Class, high-resolution Earth video camera and a medium-resolution 
imaging camera.

As the ISS circles the world 16 times per 
day, the two cameras will constantly be rolling and capturing unique 
videos and imagery of different locations underneath.

Phase 1 
of the project will see two cameras facing the ground, with one having a
 fixed gaze and the other one featuring maneuverability to points of 
interest.

The two men worked so hard — determined to accomplish the job this time — that Russian Mission Control outside Moscow urged them to 'get your breath.'

'We'll force ourselves to rest,' one of the spacewalkers replied in Russian.

The astronauts had hooked up the Earth-observing cameras during a spacewalk right after Christmas.

But ground controllers received no data from the cameras, and the spacewalkers had to haul everything back in.

The problem was traced to indoor cabling and fixed, according to NASA.

This time, after the spacewalkers reattached the high-definition camera to the outside of the Russian portion of the space station, good electrical connectivity was reported between the instrument and Russian Mission Control.

NASA spokesman Rob Navias said Russian flight controllers were pleased with the results.

'The second time a charm for its installation and activation,' Navias said.

Next, Kotov and Ryazanskiy tackled the medium-resolution camera.

Images from these new cameras will be distributed by the Canadian company that owns them, UrtheCast (pronounced EARTH-cast) Corp.

The cameras were launched to the space station last November in a deal between the Vancouver-based UrtheCast and the Russian Space Agency.

UrtheCast will post near-real-time video on its website and sell images.

The company envisions customers wanting video feeds for environmental, agricultural and humanitarian purposes.

The company expects it will take three months to calibrate the cameras, and that the system should be fully operational by summer.

Because of all the camera data trouble during the Dec. 27 spacewalk, which dragged on for eight hours, Kotov and Ryazanskiy had to put off other chores.

Those tasks were on Monday's to-do list.

The four other space station astronauts — two Americans, one Japanese and another Russian — kept tabs on the spacewalk from inside.

The firm behind the project says that anyone will be able to see the footage via a special website and customers will also be able to buy customised pictures.

Basic accounts are free and provide a live stream of imagery as the cameras fly overhead and time lapses of favourite places.

Premium accounts for enable users paying a fee to track an area without sharing it with others and to monitor larger areas of interest as well as applying image processing techniques to reveal data.

‘This is the biggest milestone UrtheCast has achieved thus far,’ explained co-founder, President and Chief Operating Officer, Wade Larson.

‘This will be the world’s first ever high definition, live-streaming video platform of planet Earth from the International Space Station.’

Phase 1 of the project will see two cameras facing the ground, with one having a fixed gaze and the other one featuring maneuverability to points of interest.

The company’s aim is to make Earth video data more accessible to individuals and schoolchildren, who will be able to log in on UrtheCast’s website, as well as the traditional customers of government and private companies.

‘Video and still image data captured by the cameras will be downlinked to ground stations across the planet and displayed on the UrtheCast web platform, or distributed directly to exclusive partners and customers,’ the firm said.

‘UrtheCast's cameras will provide high-resolution video and imagery of Earth that will allow for monitoring of the environment, humanitarian relief, social events and agricultural land.’

Current sponsors on the high profile project include the Discovery Channel, and the firm is working with the Russian Aerospace giant RSC Energia.

It is expected to take two spacewalks to install both cameras, and they will last for at least five years.
