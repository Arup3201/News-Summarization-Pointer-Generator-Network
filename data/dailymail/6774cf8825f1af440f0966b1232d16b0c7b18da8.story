A young woman was run over by two taxis and killed in front of her boyfriend as they walked home together following a drunken tiff.

Megan Hoskins, 20, was heard to shout at soldier Mark Hughes: 'just watch... the next car that comes' before apparently laying down in the road.

As Mr Hughes, also 20, tried to tend to her, a black Hackney cab ran over her, closely followed by a Skoda Octavia minicab which tried to brake but came to rest with the care assistant trapped underneath.

The inquest heard that Ms Hoskins had taken cocaine, alcohol and cannabis on the night she had died

She was rushed to hospital but died of multiple fatal injuries less than two hours later.

The tragedy occurred on July 20 last year while Megan, from Wigan, Greater Manchester was spending the weekend with Mr Hughes, who was on home leave from duty in Afghanistan.

An inquest heard the couple who were planning to move in together had watched a movie before going to a friend's house where they drank a bottle of rosé wine each and three cans of Fosters lager. 

Ms Hoskins also took some cocaine with friends before their group travelled to the Newtown Working Men's Club in Wigan.

Trouble began when Mr Hughes became angry over a man trying to dance with Ms Hoskins. They left at around midnight and continued the argument on the way home, where witnesses saw Ms Hoskins walking in front of and then behind her boyfriend.

Mr Hughes told the Bolton hearing: 'A man had came over to dance with Megan and I said "that's my girl, what are you doing?" It did wind me up. I knew she wouldn't do anything but it did wind me up. We had a bit of an argument and decided to leave.

'We decided to walk home and were having a dispute, a stupid argument like couples do but nothing serious. I was jealous and it wound me up and we were having a go at each other. At some point walking home I made a comment and she laughed.

'We were crossing over the road and she was stood at the side of me to my right. I crossed over the road then turned to the left to grab her hand and turned round to see her and it took three or four seconds to figure where she was. I saw her lying in the road and that's when the cars have come.'

Mr Hughes said he didn't hear Ms Hoskins fall or hear her shout for help and added: 'That's what I can't get out of my head. She would normally only fall over if she had heels on but she didn't have heels on. She didn't say anything.

'She would usually have a go at me if it was my fault. There was nothing.' 

Mr Hughes, pictured, said Ms Hoskins normally only ever fell over when out  if she was wearing high heels 

Asked whether he thought she lay there intentionally, Mr Hughes replied: 'I have thought that but she wouldn't have any reason to do that. Ours was a loving relationship and she was my best friend. She was always laughing and joking and she was a bubbly young lady. I had returned from work that weekend and planned to spend it with her.'

Eyewitness Amy Howarth who was having a cigarette from her bedroom window said she heard raised voices and saw a young couple in the road below. She said: 'I could hear them shouting.

'When they reached my house the male crossed the road and at this point the female ran on to the road and passed him to get in front. She was in the road in the path of cars then shouted "watch now, the next car that comes". She carried on walking in the road. I could see a fire engine going to a call with its blue lights on. I thought it was going to hit her.'

Ian Dunham, the driver of the fire engine said: 'I saw a person in the road. I turned the sirens off, I didn't swerve, and went on the wrong side of the road to give that person room. I knew they had had a drink so not to startle them I turned the siren off.

'I noticed it was a female and as we were travelling up I was watching where she was and she continued to walk not in the middle of the road but about a car's width from the pavement.'

The inquest heard the driver black Hackney cab Brian Sharples could not have avoided a collision.

Coroner Rachael Griffin returned an open conclusion after the inquest describing Ms Hoskins as 'caring'

Joseph Parkinson the driver of the Skoda Octavia following behind him said: 'The taxi in front didn't so much swerve as rock. When the lights came on I took my foot off the accelerator and then without warning at all there was a figure in the road. I hit the brakes as hard as I could. I didn't have time to swerve. If I could have done, I would have done.'

The hearing was told Ms Hoskins had studied health and social care after leaving school in order to help people. Tests showed she had traces of cocaine, cannabis and alcohol in her blood at the time of death which may have affected her judgement.

Mr Hughes was initially arrested on suspicion of Ms Hoskins' manslaughter but no action was taken against him.

Recording an open conclusion, coroner Rachael Griffin said: 'She was very clearly a bubbly young lady who was intelligent, bright and spent her life caring for others. In Miss Howarth's opinion, she believes Megan was deliberately standing in front of cars. We have heard from Mark that that didn't happen.

'I don't know how or why she was in the road. It could have been that she fell, although she would normally fall if wearing heels. It could have been that she collapsed. It could have been that she was purposefully lying in the road.

'Sadly for unknown reasons to me, through collapse or choice, Megan was lying in the road in the path of oncoming vehicles. The difficulty I have is I don't know why she was on the floor. The only person who can tell me why she was on the floor is Megan and sadly she is not here to tell me that.'
