The four men killed in a fiery plane crash in Ohio were students at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, including three members of the varsity wrestling team, school officials said Tuesday.

The three wrestlers were identified as 20-year-old Lucas Marcelli of Massillon, Ohio, 18-year-old Abraham Pishevar of Rockville, Maryland, and 18-year-old John Hill of St. Simons, Georgia. The 20-year-old pilot, William Felten of Saginaw, Michigan, also was killed. 

University officials said Felten and Marcelli were second-year students, while Hill and Pishevar were freshmen.

Marcelli graduated from Jackson High School in Massillon and twice qualified for Ohio's state wrestling tournament. 

Pilot: William Felten was piloting the small plane at the time of the crash

Victim: Lucas Marcelli was one of the four young men killed Monday evening 

Wrestlers: Abraham Pishevar, pictured, wrestled for Case Western Reserve University, along with Lucas Marcelli and John Hill

Tragic: John Hill also died after the Cessna 172R crashed and burst into flames 

 The plane crashed outside the airport and then exploded shortly after takeoff from Cuyahoga County Regional Airport in suburban Cleveland about 10 p.m. Monday. The four men were trapped inside the wreckage.

WKYC reported the plane 'had been rented for four hours and no flight plan was filed.' 

The Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board will be investigating the crash. 

Case Western Reserve University is making grief counselors available to students, and university president Barbara Snyder said in a statement that the school would be working closely with the four men's roommates and friends. 

The plane took off from an airport about 15 miles northeast of Cleveland

The victims were all reportedly students at Case Western Reserve University

'We are truly heartbroken about these promising lives cut short,' Snyder said.

Mark Gerald told the Northeast Ohio Media Group 'It's just a shame. (Me and my neighbors) thought we had (a chance to help them). It was too hot,' he said. 'The whole fuselage was involved.'

18-year-old witness William Honaker told the media group, '(The plane) was so mangled. I didn't want to look at it anymore, to be honest.' 

Crash: It was not immediately known where the plane was headed, and the names of those on board have not been released
