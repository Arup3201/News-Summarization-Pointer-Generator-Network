For 63 years, it has carried families of hippies, hauled surfers in search of killer waves and served as a workhorse across many developing countries.

But now, the Volkswagen Kombi's epic journey has finally reached the end of the road.

The iconic vehicle has succumbed to environmental legislation - meaning it will no longer be produced in Brazil, or anywhere else in the world.

Farewell gesture: The Kombi has succumbed to environmental legislation. However, Volkswagen is now offering a limited final version (pictured) to buyers and collectors

Final edition: About 1,200 'last edition' models are expected to be produced by the German manufacturer - each priced at an estimated $43,000 (£26,000)

Brazil is the only country still producing the beloved model, which was introduced in Germany in 1950.

However,
it will cease production on December 20 due to new safety regulations 
coming into force next year - mandating that every vehicle in the 
country must have air bags and anti-lock braking.

Now, as a farewell gesture, Volkswagen is offering a limited final version of the Kombi to buyers and collectors.

About
1,200 'last edition' models are expected to be produced by the German 
manufacturer - each priced at an estimated $43,000 (£26,000).  

Factory: Workers produce limited final editions of the Kombi in Volkwagen Brazil's factory in Sao Bernardo do Campo today

Production: Brazil is the only country still producing the beloved Kombi, which was introduced in Germany in 1950

End of an era: However, the country will cease production on December 20 due to new safety regulations coming into force next year - mandating that every vehicle in the country must have air bags and anti-lock braking. Above, workers test various elements of the final edition Kombi

People
across the world are mourning the end of the Kombi - with some van 
lovers holding an exhibition in Sao Bernado do Campo, Brazil, yesterday 
to honour their beloved minubuses.

In
total, more than 10million of the iconic vehicles have been produced throughout the 
world - with 1.5million having been made in Brazil since 1957.

The
vans were called the Type 2, because they were the second type to be 
offered by car maker Volkswagen - the first being the Beetle.

Over the years, they have been dubbed a variety of things, including the minivan, microvan, hippie van, campervan and the 'bus'.

In Britain and the US during the 60s and 70s, partly because it was cheap, the Type 2 became linked with youth culture - with its advertising slogan 'not just a vehicle ... more a way of life'.

Fans
of the machine said its mechanical failures only reinforced its charm 
and, because its engine was so simple, it was easy to fix, imparting a 
deeper sense of ownership.

It became popular that British enthusiasts still gather every year for the annual Volkswagen Festival near Leeds.

Celebrity fans of the iconic vehicle include actor Martin Clunes, who 
owns two campers – a rare black one with a bay windscreen, and a navy 
and white split-screen model dating from 1977.

Die hards: Die-hard British enthusiasts still gather every year for the annual VW Festival near Leeds

‘There’s 
something so self-contained about a camper,' he said. 'Driving one is like putting 
on a comfortable pair of old slippers.'

Formula
1 racing driver Jenson Button has also owned two – a red and white 
model from 1956 and a gold-coloured 1970 Volkswagen Kombi.

Jamie
Oliver was less impressed. In 2005, he drove around Europe in a 1959 
Samba version of the machine for the Channel 4 television series Jamie’s
Great Escape.

'To be honest, it was a 
complete pain,' he said. 'It was towing a heavy trailer, so perhaps it’s not 
surprising that it broke down several times.’

Beyond useful: In poorer regions like Latin American and Africa, the vehicle has continued to be made long after production ended in the UK in 1967

Multi-purpose: In Brazil, the Kombi is used by the postal service to haul mail, by the army to transport soldiers, and by funeral directors to carry corpses

Lunch van: Brazilians also convert their vans into rolling food carts, setting up on street corners for working-class lunchtime crowds

Unsafe: Production in Germany was halted in 1979 because the van no longer met European safety requirements

Damon
Ristau, director of the documentary film ‘The Bus’ about van fanatics, 
said: ‘The van represents freedom. It has a magic and charm lacking in 
other vehicles. It’s about the open road, about bringing smiles to 
peoples’ faces when they see an old VW van rolling along.'
