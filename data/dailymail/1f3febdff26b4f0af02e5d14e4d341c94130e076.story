Shoppers who have bought presents through the Marks & Spencer website face an anxious wait for their Christmas orders due to problems plaguing the firm’s delivery service.

The retailer warned customers that deliveries could take up to two weeks. The brand has also been forced to suspend its next-day-delivery service.

The delays, caused by a backlog of orders following Black Friday last week, have hit the retailer today - ‘Manic Monday’ - which marks one of the busiest shopping day of the year.

Customers have been told deliveries from Marks and Spencer may take weeks following a surge of orders on Black Friday 

The Castle Donington distribution centre in the east Midlands which opened last year has been unable to keep up with demand.

When the centre opened, Marks & Spencer said that it would be able to handle 1million items a day.

Disgruntled shoppers took to social media to complain about the service provided by Marks & Spencer.

One shopper, Sue Smith, wrote on the Marks & Spencer Facebook page: ‘Thirteen WORKING (ie, Mon-Fri) days wait for free/standard delivery. You’re having a laugh - we’ve had orders from China delivered quicker than that and at a similar cost too.’

Another Twitter user @gazbroc wrote: ‘@marksandspencer poor service from M&S who supposedly prides itself on delighting it’s customers !!ordered Xmas tree 24th nov STILL WAITING!’

A Marks & Spencer spokesperson said: ‘Our customer is always our top priority and that is why we’ve extended some of our delivery options. The vast majority of orders are delivered on time. If we do miss a delivery date, we will do all we can to rectify it for the customer.’

Today, stores are offering deeper Christmas discounts than last year as they attempt to shift unsold stock on one of the biggest days of the year for on-line shopping.

The details have been revealed by accountants Deloitte which will see hundreds of millions of pounds spent by bargain hunters in search of the perfect Christmas gift on ‘Manic Monday’.

Industry experts predict that up to £750million will be spent online today, which is £520,000 a minute, which would be around 40per cent higher than last year.

Scots are expected to spend in the region of £63 million, following on from a combined £128 million spent on so called ‘Black Friday’ and ‘Cyber Monday’.

Deloitte said the success of ‘Black Friday’ in terms of online sales and getting shoppers through the door has changed the way retailers and consumers view the run-up to Christmas.

It seems shoppers who have suffered a six year cost of living squeeze are refusing to make purchases unless retailers can promise them a bargain.

The firm said it is the fourth year in a row that Christmas discounts have come earlier and been larger than the year before.

However, Deloitte warned shoppers that some retailers appear to have bought stock in specifically to offer pre-Christmas discounts and create the impression of bargains.

It said: ‘An unseasonably warm autumn has left many retailers, especially in fashion, trying to clear unsold winter stock as they enter the most important trading period of the year.

‘For many, the discounting season kicked off with the Black Friday weekend, the biggest ever seen in the UK. However, all is not as it seems, with some retailers buying in stock specifically with pre-Christmas discounting in mind.’

Consumer business partner at Deloitte, Jason Gordon, said: ‘At the moment we are seeing marginally deeper pre-Christmas reductions than last year, and the success of Black Friday has demonstrated the UK consumers’ appetite for a bargain.

‘However, retailers need to be careful not to create a consumer that is only willing to buy heavily discounted items, especially as a lot of the products reduced on Black Friday were ‘bought for sale’.’

Deloitte research found there is already a wide spread of discounts across the market, ranging from eight per cent to 78per cent. It said they are likely to grow in number and size, with discounts of up to 90per cent anticipated after Christmas.

Weekends remain the key days for retailers when it comes to the timing of promotions, with the last weekend before Christmas set to be pivotal both in-store and online, thanks to the growth of click and collect.

Mr Gordon said: ‘Christmas falls on a Thursday this year, so retailers could wait until early that week to make their final big pre-Christmas discounts, but we predict they will come before that, on the final weekend. 

After Christmas further discounts are expected on Boxing Day. Shoppers clamber over each other on December 26 last year in Selfridges (above) 

'Looking beyond Christmas, at the current sales velocity we will have noticeably deeper discounts from Boxing Day.’

Historically, Manic Monday has been busier for web stores than Black Friday, however that seems unlikely this year. Internet sales in the UK on Black Friday were an estimated £810million, which was almost 50per cent higher than expected by the industry.

Amazon is releasing a number of ‘lightning deals’ today. Fashion brand Asos is offering 20 per cent off Asos branded items, while Body Shop is offering 40 per cent off when you buy three items, and 30 per cent off when you buy two.

Currys PC World are offering savings up to £500 on certain large-screen TVs, and up to £200 on large kitchen appliances.

M&S offered a 50 per cent-off ‘gifting weekend’ sale with deals that are still available today and there is also up to 70 per cent on selected sale items. Topshop is also offering savings of up to 65 per cent.
