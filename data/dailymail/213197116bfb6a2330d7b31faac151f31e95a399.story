A confused Frenchman looking to return home took a wrong turn on his rickshaw - and ended up travelling down a dual-carriageway.

The cyclist was trying to find his way to Newhaven to catch a ferry across the channel.

But he ended up navigating his way through 70mph cars and lorries on the A27 near Lewes, East Sussex, in the pouring rain.

Not that way! Shocked motorists took this picture of a Frenchman attempting to pedal his way to the coast to catch a ferry home - but ended up on the A27 near Lewes in East Sussex

Motorists swerved to overtake the man this afternoon as he pedalled down the motorway.

Realising he had made a mistake, he was seen at one point pulling over as cars and lorries sped past.

Sussex Police were alerted and officers who found him were told that he was seeking to return to his homeland via nearby Newhaven.

Rescue: Sussex Police were alerted to the incident and scaled the motorway to find him and guide him home

A police spokesman said: 'At 1.45pm on
 Thursday 10 July a motorist told police that a man had been seen on the
 eastbound Lewes bypass, just east of the Kingston roundabout, pedalling
 a three-wheel trike.

'Local officers quickly found the man who was a French national seeking to return home via Newhaven.

'They advised him that it was dangerous to be on that stretch of road, especially during heavy rain, and escorted him safely to the other end of the bypass where he was able to take a safe cycle path connecting with the A26 to Newhaven and went on his way.'
