Two senior ministers in Tony Blair’s government are facing a possible criminal probe over the alleged torture and unlawful killing of hundreds of Iraqis by British soldiers.

Former Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon and ex-Armed Forces Minister Adam Ingram have been named in an application to the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) to investigate claims of abuse in Iraq from 2003 to 2008.

Lawyers representing Iraqi victims have submitted a 250-page dossier to the ICC, including at least 1,200 allegations of war crimes,  based on witness statements  and evidence from the International Committee of  the Red Cross and other humanitarian organisations.

The application calls for an investigation to be opened into the crimes and the apparent  role of senior British officials, ‘in particular Geoff Hoon and Adam Ingram’.

Last night, Phil Shiner, of Public Interest Lawyers, said: ‘We have got over a thousand cases of torture and about 200 cases of unlawful killings, many of them took place in custody.

‘Every way you look at it this points to the very top, and that means Geoff Hoon and others.’

The application, presented to the ICC at its headquarters in The Hague on Friday, accuses Mr Hoon and Mr Ingram of failing to prevent British troops mishandling prisoners and using outlawed interrogation techniques.

Mr Hoon and Mr Ingram were unavailable for comment last night, but an MoD spokesman said ICC action was unnecessary because matters are being investigated by the Government.

They added: ‘We reject the suggestion that the UK’s Armed Forces, who operate in line  with domestic and international law, Have systematically tortured detainees.’
