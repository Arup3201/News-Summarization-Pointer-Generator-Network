After a string of horse deaths over the last ten years, this week's Grand National will now be run over new plastic fences in the hope of making the course less dangerous.

Last year joint favourite Synchronised and outsider 
According to Pete had to be put down after falling
at the sixth fence of the Grand National, the infamous Becher's Brook at Aintree racecourse, Liverpool.

The deaths led to public outcry and calls from animal welfare groups for the Grand National 
to be banned.

Outcry: According to Pete injured himself during the 2012 Grand National falling over the old birch barrier and had to be put down

Infamous: The new Becher's Brook fence at Aintree racecourse no longer has a hard birch core but has been covered by spruces so it will not affect the appearance of the course

Aintree has responded to criticism by introducing several safeguards to help make the demanding course more horse-friendly.

The most important change will be the fences, which have seen many dangerous falls in the past.

Aintree managing director John Baker said: ‘The fences 
will look the same. The idea is to make the core 
softer.'

When the spruce is knocked off, the wooden core may possibly 
have contributed to injury.'

The fences will remain the same height so this year's race should be safer but not any easier.

Softer: Aintree's managing director conceded that the old wooden core may 'possibly have contributed to injury'

The timber frame 
has been replaced by a plastic core covered with birch.

Over the top will be a minimum of fourteen inches of 
spruce and horses can knock off the spruce without injuring themselves.

David Muir, an equine consultant for the
RSPCA, praised the changes.

'The old fences were unique to Aintree,' he
said. 'They were completely solid and four or five wooden posts deep.

He explained: 'If a horse hit them, it would be catapulted into almost a somersault. I 
pushed very hard to have them taken away.

Fatal: Synchronized, ridden by Tony McCoy, fell at Becher's Brook in 2012

The chief executive of the RSPCA, 
Gavin Grant, claims the death of Gold Cup winner Synchronised prompted 
many people in racing to do a bit of 'soul searching'.Grant said: 'The
Grand National is on trial. I simply don't think the 
public will tolerate another National like the ones we've had the last 
few years.'

'To many inside the racing industry, the death of Synchronised was a final moment to say, 'It has got to change''.

One of the more controversial changes is moving the start 90 yards 
forward so that the horses will not be so worked up when they start.

The noisy grandstand can agitate some horses, causing them to bolt out from the start to the first fence.

The new fences are in place ready for this year’s race on April 6.
