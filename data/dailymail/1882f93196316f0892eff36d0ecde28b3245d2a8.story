Android Lollipop has started rolling out to more handsets,with the likes of HTC One M8 and Samsung Galaxy Note 4 on the list to get it. 

Among all the new features the software update offers, one in particular could potentially revolutionise how we listen to music. 

Google has added support for what's known as USB audio, which means the USB charging port on Android Lollipop devices can be used to play music through speakers or compatible headphones.

Apple already supports USB audio through its Lightning connector.

And, although Apple's own range of proprietary headphones still use the traditional 3.5mm audio jack, Philips has produced a Lightning-compatible pair that can be used with the latest iPhones and iPads called Fidelio M2L. 

This does mean, however, that these headphones can only be used with Apple devices.  

As the technology becomes more mainstream, other manufacturers - and even Apple itself - are expected to launch a range of USB audio headphones.

When using USB audio, the wires carry digital signals all the way to the earbuds, where it is then converted to analog. This prevents the sound quality dropping as it travels through the wire. Removing the audio jack (pictured right, next to the Lightning connector in the centre) could also make future devices thinner

Audio is available in analog and digital.

Computers and music files produce audio in a digital format, but speakers, typically use an analog signal to play the sounds.

Even digital speakers are traditionally analog speakers that feature a signal converter.

When using a standard, circular 3.5mm audio jack the wire with traditional headphones, the wire carries the signal in analog format.

However, with USB audio, the wires carry the digital signal all the way to the earbuds, where it is then converted to analog.

This prevents the sound quality dropping as it travels through the wire.

Removing the audio jack could also make future devices thinner.  

However, when the USB port, or Lightning connector, is being used to carry audio it means the same port can't be used to charge the device.
