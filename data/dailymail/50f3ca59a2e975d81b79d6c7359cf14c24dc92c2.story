Disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner is finally giving up on his dreams of being a public office holder.

The New York Democrat admitted in a recent interview with Politico that his career in politics 'is probably over' now that he's been caught engaging in sexual dalliances with young women who are not his wife on two separate occasions.

'The only job I ever wanted more than Congress was mayor, and I don’t think that either of those two jobs are going to be available,' Weiner told Politico in an interview that was published on the site today.

 'So, no, it’s not like, "OK, how do I get back in?" I’m not thinking that anymore,' he said. 'I think I kind of took my stab at that.'

Weiner and his son Jordan, 2,  walk the Tribeca Film Festival street in April. Weiner said in a recent interview that if he hadn't been pushed out of Congress after sending lewd messages to young women, he eventually would have left federal office to spend more time with his young son

Weiner resigned from his congressional seat in 2011 after a conservative news organization revealed that he had sent an explicit picture to a 21-year-old college student over his Twitter account.

The married Congressman initially denied sending the lewd photo and suggested that he was the victim of a hack. 

But after the news organization, led by late conservative blogger Andrew Breitbart, accused Weiner of sending a second photo of himself to another woman, Weiner confessed to carrying on with half a dozen women online over a three-year period both before and after his marriage to Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin.

Less than two years after exiting Congress Weiner attempted reenter politics by running for New York mayor. 

Early on in the Democratic primary the former congressman appeared to be on the verge of a political comeback. Three months later he found himself at the center of new sexting allegations, however. This time he was accused of having an secret relationship with a 22-year-woman named Sydney Leathers.

Weiner acknowledged that he conversed with Leathers under the screen name Carols Danger from late 2012 right up to the time he announced his mayoral bid and to having sexual relationships online with up to 10 women but refused to drop out of the race.

He quickly dropped to the back of the pack in the race, receiving just 4.5 percent of the vote when all was said and done.

Sydney Leathers, then 22, is one of the young women who Weiner had inappropriate contact with after he exited Congress. Their relationship became public while Weiner was trying to make a political comeback last year

Since then he has penned columns for the New York Daily News and Business Insider and made television appearances on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher and a local New York news channel.

'It wasn’t like I wanted to see it as a career, but I still have an itch to scratch of having ideas about things and wanting to talk about them,' Weiner said of his rebirth as a political pundit. 

'You don’t just after a 25-year career, caring about issues and caring about what’s going on in your city, just kind of turn it off,' explained. 

Weiner told Politico that he also earns a living through consulting. Another project he's in the process of setting up is a nonprofit restaurant that helps keep at-risk youth on the straight and narrow by providing them experience working in  food service.

Despite his continued interest in national politics, Weiner indicated that he was happy to not be working in Washington anymore because it allows him to spend more time with his son, Jordan, who turns three this year.

'I would have quit Congress to be home with Jordan, plain and simple,' Weiner claimed. 'I would not be sitting around in Washington waiting for the Senate to come back into session to pass some CR.

'I could not imagine it any other way. I would’ve lost my marbles,' he proclaimed.

He tried to make a political comeback last year when he ran for mayor but a sexting scandal interrupted and ruined his political aspirations then, too
