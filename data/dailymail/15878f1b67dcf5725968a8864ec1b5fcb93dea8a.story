Singer Melanie Chisholm has openly admitted to having an eating disorder whilst she was a member of the Spice Girls.

But now the 39-year-old has taken control of her weight and exercise regime - she has been training for triathlons and competed in one last Saturday - and is taking diet inspiration from former bandmate and friend Victoria Beckham.

Speaking to Closer magazine, Mel said: 'Victoria is on the alkaline diet and she swears by it for healthy eating and weight loss.

New diet: Mel C is following Victoria Beckham's favourite diet: the alkaline diet, which is made up of mostly fruit and vegetables

'It's loads of fruit vegetables and grains. I need to eat lots at the moment because of my training regime.'

Victoria is a huge fan of the Honestly Healthy Alkaline Programme, 
which involves eating predominantly alkaline foods in an effort to keep 
the body’s pH between 7.35 and 7.45, and claims to be able to heal a 
variety of ailments in addition to weight loss.

And now Mel is hooked on the ultra-strict regime, which warns against
 ‘very acid forming’ foods like starchy grains and vegetables such as 
pasta, wheat and beans, all dairy products, meat, fish and shellfish.'

Speaking about the diet, she said: 'I feel amazing! 8th training day in a row and I just had a
 great swim. Thank you! I thought I knew what I was doing nutritionwise
 bit I'm amazed what a difference alkalising makes.'

But the mother-of-one is aware that she has to take good care of herself after a history of body issues.

'I'm careful not to overdo it because I had a breakdown when I was in the Spice Girls from working too hard, and I don't want that to happen again,' she said.

Back in 2000, a combination of overworking and under eating left Mel with depression.

However, she turned her life around when she became pregnant with daughter Scarlet, now age four, and said it was 'liberating' to be able to relax her body.

5ft 6in Mel now weighs a healthy 9st and wears a dress size 8 thanks to her new diet and intense fitness training for the Virgin Active London Triathlon.

Then and now:  A combination of overworking and under-eating left Mel with depression but becoming a mother and transforming her lifestyle means that she is back on track now

Mel and Victoria are just the latest celebrities in a long line of A-listers to join the alkaline diet club.

Fearne Cotton, Kelly Brook, Millie Mackintosh, Robbie Williams and Lisa 
Snowdon have all followed the diet in the past and Fearne recently credited it with helping her get her pre-pregnancy figure back.

The Alkaline Programme involves eating predominantly alkaline foods in an effort to keep the body’s pH between 7.35 and 7.45, and claims to be able to heal a variety of ailments in addition to weight loss

The ultra-strict regime warns against
 ‘very acid forming’ foods like starchy grains and vegetables such as 
pasta, wheat and beans, all dairy products, meat, fish and shellfish.'

Also banned are tea, coffee, sugar, fizzy drinks including soda and tonic water, and of course alcohol.

Victoria Beckham recently
 tweeted about her new eating scheme praising the Honestly Healthy recipe book 
by Vicki Edgson and organic chef Natasha Corrett.

While
 following the plan at least 70 per cent of your diet should be 
alkaline, while the other 30 per cent can be acidic ... which basically 
means a lot of fruit and vegetables.

If followed correctly the diet claims to
help improve energy levels and memory, headaches, bloating, heart 
disease, muscle pain and insomnia.

The
 book's 106 recipes include artichoke and basil pizza, raw buckwheat and
 cinnamon granola, mung bean curry and sweet-potato chocolate brownies.
