A navy warship accidentally fired a 45kg torpedo into a dockyard wharf, it has emerged.

HMS Argyll was on a training exercise in Plymouth when the 9ft missile was ‘jettisoned unexpectedly’.

It tore through a security fence at the Devonport naval base before slamming into a storage container.

The Royal Navy said the Test Variant Torpedo was a dummy weapon that did not contain any explosives.

It said there was only minor damage 
to the security fence and no one was injured in the incident on 
Wednesday afternoon, but training has been suspended while an 
investigation is carried out.

A
 Navy spokesman said: ‘HMS Argyll was conducting a system test when an 
inert Test Variant Torpedo was jettisoned unexpectedly. The torpedo is 
not an explosive hazard.

‘The specific details of the incident are subject to further investigation and it would be inappropriate to comment further.’

HMS Argyll, which was built in the late 1980s, is the longest-serving Type 23 frigate in the Royal Navy.

The Ministry of Defence refused to say whether or not any of the submarines were at Devonport at the time of the accident.

A
 source said: 'The torpedo came shooting out of the side of Argyll and 
flew through the air before going straight through a security fence.

'It's
 carried on going before hitting a storage container. If anyone was 
inside it they would have a had a nasty shock - the whole side of the 
container was stoved in.

'Had the thing been armed it would have let out a 200-metre blast. You could be talking about a major loss of life.

'The Navy guys and the civilian dock workers are understandably appalled by what has happened. Someone has obviously pushed the button, presumably by accident - the big question is who.'

HMS Argyll is currently the oldest serving Duke Type 23 frigate in the Royal Navy, having been launched in 1989.

The 4,900-tonne ship underwent a £20million refit in 2009 to ensure her weaponry was at the cutting edge of naval warfare.

Her
 armaments include anti-aircraft missiles, harpoon launchers, a 4.5in 
mk8 cannon and two 12.75in 'Sting Ray' torpedo tubes, which are normally
 submerged below the water but were exposed by the tide at the time of 
Wednesday's accident.

The self-propelled torpedoes are armed with 45kg warheads to take out enemy submarines that they lock onto with acoustic homing sensors.

The Royal Navy spokesman added: 'We can confirm an incident occurred onboard HMS Argyll on Wednesday 12th. The ship was alongside at Devonport Naval Base in Plymouth.

'During a training exercise, an inert
 Test Variant Torpedo unexpectedly jettisoned onto the wharf. There was 
no explosion and no casualties.

'An investigation is now under way to determine the cause of the incident. The torpedo is not an explosive hazard.

'The specific details of the incident are subject to further investigation and it would be inappropriate to comment further.

Danger: If the torpedo had been fully armed it could have caused serious damage (file photo)

'The result of the investigation will determine what actions will be necessary to avoid any repeat of this incident in the future.

'However, torpedo system test firing alongside in the naval base has been suspended subject to completion of the investigation.'

Devonport, the second biggest naval base in western Europe, is one of three operating bases for the Royal Navy.

The 650-acre facility is also the sole military's only nuclear repair and refuelling facility.
