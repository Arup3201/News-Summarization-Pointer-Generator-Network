Sarah Jessica Parker's second SJP shoe collection is here - and Carrie Bradshaw would be proud.

The latest styles pay tribute to the actress's friends, as well as her New York City home. One statement boot, the 'Pat', is named after Sex And The City's legendary costume designer, Patricia Field, while the 'Serge' boot is named after her hair stylist Serge Normant.

The line, available at Nordstrom, runs the gamut from Nineties classics (which, incidentally, are making a comeback) to rather more daring lace-up shoe-boots. 

All tied up: The latest SJP Sarah Jessica Parker shoe collection features the 'Lee' side lace bootie ($495)

Kick it: The Gina (left) is $495 while the Serge, named for hairstylist Serge Normant (right) is $455

The 'Carrie' T-bar, which made so many headlines last time around, is back, as is The 'Alison' - a sexy lace-up shoe-boot that exposes the foot at the front. 

There are bags too - the name of the 'New Yorker' hobo speaks to aspiring Miss Bradshaws, while the 'Greenwich' tote is a more contemporary style that could well be named after the upscale Connecticut enclave, Greenwich Village or the street and avenue of the same name.

The price point remains high for a celebrity line - $220 to $695 - but then it was developed with the help of Manolo Blahnik CEO, George Malkemus.

And it seems they are a good team. She told The Washingtonian: 'It’s unlike any other collaboration I’ve ever been a part of. It’s crazy, crazy simple in a way because we have lots and lots of ideas, our points of references are really similar. We didn’t realize but we have a short hand that’s really fun. 

'We basically think about feelings and themes and from there we work. We get to a place where we have enough information to send to Ricardo in Italy, he makes our shoes for us, and then Ricardo gives us feedback. It’s an amazing three-way conversation. Then the samples come back and we tweak, tweak, tweak. We change the proportions, the elastic, we almost have a formula down now.'

Down to a T-bar: The much-loved 'Carrie' ($355, left) and the 'Blythe' ($375, right)

Step on it: The 'Daphne' (left) is a bold grosgrain pump ($395) while the 'Marlene' brogue pump comes in a glossy silver ($375)
