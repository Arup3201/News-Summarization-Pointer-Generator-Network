Zookeepers have finally been able to get close enough to a protective mother gorilla to determine the sex of her baby.

And after two months Twycross Zoo, Warwickshire, is finally able to 
announce it is a bouncing baby boy.

Mother, Ozala, gave birth to the critically endangered western 
lowland gorilla, on January 3, 2013, at 9.15am following a short and stress-free labour.

But staff at the zoo soon found they were unable to get close enough to 16-stone Ozala to take a look at her baby.

And after two months Twycross Zoo, Warwickshire, are finally able to announce it is a bouncing baby boy

Ozala, gave birth to the critically endangered western lowland gorilla, on January 3 2013, at 9.15am following a short and stress-free labour

Yet, while initially some were lucky to catch a glimpse of the newborn, Ozala is now a very confident and relaxed mother, enabling staff to properly inspect the infant.

Now, the only thing left to do is to decide on a name for the baby.

The zoo is part of a successful primate breeding programme. The youngster, is the fourth offspring born to the 18-year-old female.

At the time of the birth, Neil Dorman, curator of conservation programmes and planning at the zoo, said: 'Gorillas are very protective creatures, for the first few weeks, even months, the baby with stay very close to mum, she will carry it all the time.

'Even when it starts to become more independent, she won't let it venture very far from her.

'Because she is holding it so close it is very difficult to tell the sex, early indications are it is a boy, but we can't be certain.

'She's being very attentive towards it, cleaning it, feeding it, all the signs are good at this stage.'

Gorillas have been at Twycross Zoo, which is part of the European breeding programme for critically endangered primates, since the 1960s and they have been successfully breeding the animals since 1985.

After the baby gorilla was born, staff at the zoo soon found were unable to get close enough to 16-stone Ozala to take a look at him

In 2009 a new 20-year-old male, a dominant silverback named Oumbie, was introduced to Twycross' gorilla 'troop,' which also includes Ozala's mother, Biddy, 38, and her half-sister, Asante, 27.

By that time Ozala had already had two babies - her first born, Matadi, arrived in March 2003 and is now cared for at Paignton Zoo, Devon. Unfortunately, her second baby, a female named Ndoki, who was born in May 2007, died aged just three months.

However, following the arrival of Oumbie, Ozala fell pregnant again and a male Okanda was born last April.

Although Okanda suffered some problems around six months old, when the zoo's vet Sarah Chapman was forced to care for him at home for a spell because he wasn't getting enough nutrients from his mother, he survived and is currently living at Stuttgart Zoo, Germany.

Oumbie is also the father of the new baby

A 60 per cent decline in numbers in the last 25 years has moved the central African ape's status from 'endangered' to 'critically endangered'.

Forest clearance, which has allowed hunters into previously inaccessible areas, combined with the deadly Ebola virus, has been blamed for wiping out a third of all western lowland gorillas in protected areas in just 15 years.
