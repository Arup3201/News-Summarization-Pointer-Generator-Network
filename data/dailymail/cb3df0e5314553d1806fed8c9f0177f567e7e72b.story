Ruth Blair, a farmer, and James Mackie, a fruit and veg company boss, had rescued the giant horse, who was being badly mistreated and heading for the meat trade.

After carefully nursing him back to health, Lincoln, now stands at more than 20 hands or 6ft 10in from shoulder blades to hoof, and is thought to be the biggest horse in Britain. 

With his size comes a massive appetite and Lincoln's daily diet consists of  two stone of carrots, 24 apples, 11lbs of spinach and five cabbages.

James, who luckily is the boss of a fruit and veg company, said: 'I don't know how anyone else could afford to feed him.

'Lincoln had been very badly treated, was very emaciated and was going to end up in the meat trade.

'When he came to us I thought he was too far gone to survive but he got vitamin injections and got a spark back in his eyes.

A healthy lunch: Lincoln gets through an incredible  two stone of carrots, 24 apples, 11lbs of spinach and five cabbages each day

The horse was rescued from the slaughter by farmer Ruth Blair and James Mackie, from Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire and nursed back to health at Tannoch Stables (pictured)

'Lincoln is the biggest horse in Europe and when I put him into the stable he hit his head off the roof.

'He still has a bit of growing to do but already you can't see over his back if you are standing next to him.

'Sitting on his back would be like sitting on top of a Transit van.  

Thought to be the biggest horse in Europe, Lincoln has a massive appetite to match his enormous size, eating as much as two stone of carrots every day

Lincoln lives a life of luxury at Tannoch Stables in Cumbernauld where his owners  look after him and his huge appetite

If Mr Mackie was buying Lincoln's food at the supermarket, he would be paying out  around £28.50, based on average fruit and vegetable costs.

That works out at just under £200 a week, £855 a month or a staggering £10,374 a year.

 'He is a friendly big horse but so far has pulled down three fences and when I was sat in a golf buggy, he lifted the entire thing up in his mouth.

And Lincoln, who lives a life of luxury at Tannoch Stables in Cumbernauld, will continue to grow for the next two years.

One day he could even rival the biggest horse in the world, which is currently just three quarters of an inch taller than him.

Ruth, from Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire, said: 'Lincoln is a fabulous big horse with a kind, docile nature but has a tremendous amount of power in him. He now has a lifetime home and we are really happy to have rescued him.'
