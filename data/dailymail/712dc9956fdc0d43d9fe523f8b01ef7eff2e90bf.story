Taxpayers face a £2million bill after plans to increase the amount that MPs contribute towards their gold-plated pensions were quietly dropped.

The Treasury was expecting a 1.85 per cent rise in contributions to come into play this April – but yesterday the MPs’ expenses watchdog made the surprise announcement that the rise was being suspended.

It means the taxpayer will be forced to plough even more money into MPs’ pensions to plug the gap, at a time when millions are having to tighten their belts to fund higher contributions towards their own pensions.

MPs were expected to pay 1.85 per cent more into their pensions, but the expenses watchdog IPSA has postponed the increase leaving the Treasury plug the £2million gap

Almost all public sector workers are 
facing contribution rises of up to 6 per cent, and for staff in the 
private sector contribution rates are also going up.

Chancellor George Osborne must now find the extra money to make up the shortfall

Despite this, the Independent 
Parliamentary Standards Authority said it will put off any decisions on 
members’ contributions until after it has considered the whole issue of 
MPs’ pay and pensions in a report expected later this year.

The decision means that policemen will be paying more towards their pensions than MPs by 2015.

MPs’ pensions arrangements are among 
the most generous in the country. They contribute an average of 13.2 per
cent of their £65,738 salaries into the schemes, which pay out after 
they reach 65.

In contrast, by 2015 policemen will be contributing 13.7 per cent towards their pensions.

MPs have to pay into their scheme for 
far fewer years than ordinary workers before getting a full pension. And
they benefit from a higher  taxpayer contribution to their pensions 
than any other group in the public sector – almost 29 per cent compared 
with 14 per cent for teachers and nurses.

A 1.85 per cent rise in their 
contributions was due to start this April but this will no longer happen
following IPSA’s decision yesterday.

It is expected that the Treasury will 
have to find £2million to plug the gap – at a time when frontline 
services are being pared to the bone.

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of 
the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘MPs should be subject to the same 
pension reforms they’re imposing on the wider public sector.

Former pension adviser to the Treasury Ros Altmann said it was 'rather unusual' that MPs¿ contributions were not increasing when voters were feeling the pinch

‘They say we’re all in it together, so
it’s only fair that politicians contribute more to their hugely 
generous pension schemes to help repair our broken public finances.’

Last night Ros Altmann, former pension
adviser to the Treasury, said: ‘At a time when pensions are becoming 
more expensive to provide, it is rather unusual that MPs’ contributions 
are not increasing when they are everywhere else.’

IPSA said it deferred the rise so the 
contribution rate could be considered alongside other aspects as part of
a wholesale review of pay and pensions.

A spokesman said: ‘MPs’ pensions 
certainly need looking at. And that is why we are in the middle of a 
fundamental review looking at both MPs’ pensions and pay.’
