From Russia With Love may be the name of a popular James Bond film, but it could also be used to describe the experience basketball superstar Lauren Jackson had when playing for Spartak Moscow and taken under the wing of the club's controversial millionaire owner Shabtai von Kalmanovic.

In fact the James Bond similarities don't end there as Von Kalmanovic was an ex-KGB spy turned businessman who had spent five and a half years in an Israeli prison after he was convicted of spying for the Soviet Union.

From 2007 to 2009 Jackson played for Spartak on a multi-million dollar contract. Her loving benefactor would also shower the Australian basketball player with expensive gifts and get her everything she could wish for.

But her friendship with the possessive Von Kalmanovic gradually turned into an oppressive partnership. 

“My experience there, the lifestyle, it is beyond belief to most people,” Jackson told the Sunday Telegraph.

From the outside she looked to be living a charmed existence with Von Kalmanovic showering Jackson with diamonds when she played well. She would fly the globe on his private jet. 

And that was just for starters. She'd a personal driver and lived rent-free in a luxurious six bedroom apartment. The Russian millionaire even flew in singer Kelis to help celebrate one victory.

But Von Kalmanovic's smothering obsessiveness took it's toll. Suddenly Jackson had no control whatsoever over her life. Her Russian boss was calling all the shots.

It seemed that it was only while playing on the basketball court that she could make her own decisions. 

It was a strange and at times startling period of her life. At one time Von Kalmanovic’s security detail started following her and other Spartak players through a local mall after a game.

'He was even wearing a trench coat,' Jackson says. 'Shabtai said it was for our own protection.'

The kind of world Von Kalmanovic was involved in couldn't have been made any clearer though when in November 2009 he was shot dead in Moscow,

It was a professional hit. Two men just drove up beside Von Kalmonvic's luxury Mercedes and riddled the vehicle with bullets, in what The Guardian reported at the time was a classic assassin's tactic.

Jackson was devastated by the loss. But for all the riches that had been given to her she felt empty inside. She had a lavish lifestyle but something was missing. Now all she wanted was peace and quiet.

She moved back to Canberra where she now lives the quiet life. The glitz and glamour of Russia couldn't be further away.

The 33-year-old is hoping she will be fit to play for Australia in next year's Rio OIympics after being her country's flag bearer for London 2012

Last week the 33-year-old - who plays for the Seattle Storm in the US - had her sixth knee operation in the last 12 months, but despite this she still wants to play for Australia at next year's Rio Olympics. 

Her shimmering record includes playing in four Olympic Games and winning three silver and one bronze medal, according to basketballaustralia. Olympic gold has remained an elusive dream.

But whatever the future holds its her time living and playing in Russia that has made an indelible mark on her. And she believes she is all the better for the experience.
