In a former life Rose Black was a professional swimmer and track and field athlete.

Now the 33-year-old, from Narromine near Dubbo in central-west NSW is a multi-awarding winning bodybuilder and has her sights set on one of the sport's largest and most prestigious international competitions.

Ms Black trains every morning and night - even on the weekends - and gives herself just two afternoons off a week.  

She consumes between five and ten meals a day, and all this on top of holding down a full-time job as a public servant.

From central-west NSW, Ms Black started competing just a few years ago and already has a series of titles under her belt

Earlier this month the 33-year-old won three titles at the International Natural Bodybuilding Association (INBA) Australian titles

Just a few weeks ago the athlete took out three International Natural Bodybuilding Association (INBA) Australian titles; Ms Figure International (over 165cm), Ms Figure (over 165cm) and Overall Ms Figure International.

Also under her belt are a World Championship title for the over 165cm and open divisions.

However Ms Black's biggest feat will be raising enough money to get to San Diego next month for the Natural Olympia - which would be her debut competition after gaining professional status.

Ms Black trains twice a day on almost every single day of the week, but gives herself two afternoons off

She also eats up to ten meals a day so she can keep up her energy levels and muscle mass

The athlete used to be a professional swimmer but took on bodybuilding when she retired from that

A week in the life of a bodybuilder may seem exhausting for one not involved in the sport, but Ms Black described it as a 'lifestyle' she began only a few years ago.

'I train morning and afternoon, I train every day,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'I do have two afternoons off a week (Sunday and Tuesday),' she said before adding sometimes she would switch up her routine and take all of Sunday off.

'I just have to fit it around work, I train early in the morning.

Monday AM: Shoulders and chest

Monday PM: Strength and conditioning class

Tuesday AM: Legs (quads, calves, glutes)

Saturday AM: Legs 

Saturday PM: Hight intensity interval training

Sunday: Rest day

Back: Chin ups - Start hanging on a bar and end up with your chin over it

Legs: Squats - A full body exercise which can have weight added to increase the difficulty

Shoulders: Arnie press - a variation of a shoulder press where you lift weights above the head

Abs: Hanging leg raise - Start hanging on a bar and raise straight legs as high as possible

Chest: Incline press - Lay on a bench which is inclined and lift dumbells

Glutes: Glute ham raises - Using the bench this works your entire posterior range

Biceps: Barbell bicep curls

Triceps: Dips with weight

Calves: Standing calf raises

Quads: Leg press - Varying weights can be used depending on ability 

'It takes a lot of commitment - either that or I'm insane,' Ms Black joked.  

 As for finding motivation to jump out of bed and hit the weights bright and early every single day of the week, the bodybuilder admitted even she struggles with it sometimes - 'like any human'.

'In the winter it's tough, (but) once you're set in a routine you just do it', Ms Black said. 

'There are days when I find it tough and question what I'm doing.' 

Ms Black admits while it is tough to get motivated sometimes it's all about getting into a routine

She also said the only way to get lean and build muscle is to lift weights regularly

Some of her top tips for keeping fit include drinking lemon in warm water every morning

Throughout her 12 training sessions a week Ms Black makes sure each session focuses on a different part of the body.

Some day she will focus on just her legs, others will work her core, and a few more sessions will be dedicated to her arms and chest.

To keep up the energy levels and bulk needed to train at such high intensity and frequency all the time the athlete eats up to ten meals a day.

These are all relatively small and are about the 'macro breakdown' and include foods high in protein, low in carbohydrates and with good fats.

In an average day Ms Black would eat oats sprinkled with some protein powder for breakfast, barramundi with vegetables for one of her lunchtime meals and kangaroo with a salad later in the day, with other small meals dispersed in between.

In terms of the tips she swears by the bodybuilder revealed she starts every day with some lemon in warm water.

Ms Black has completely transformed her body shape from a few years ago, seen here in 2012

During her sessions she will often focus on one muscle group such as her legs or core

'It dealcoholizes your body and helps you metabolise fat faster', Ms Black said.

Breakfast: Oats with protein powder

Meal two:  Fish with vegetables

Meal three: Kangaroo salad with baby spinach, capsicum and mushrooms

Meal four: Tuna and broccoli 

Meal five: Egg Whites

Repeat: Meals two-five 

Meal ten: A different type of fish with different vegetables 

She also likes to add 'fat-burning' foods to each meal such as capsicum, chilli flakes or garlic.

Each week Ms Black has two to three 'high carb' days where she consumes more foods such as sweet potato, quinoa and brown rice. On these days she also includes more fruits such as berries and kiwi fruit. 

In preparation for competitions under the guidance of her coach Ken Ross, Ms Black takes her body through a range of processes.

Initially she 'carb cycles' - which means varying the amount of carbohydrates consumed on any given day - and then ups her intake in the days leading up to a comp.

Ms Black also pointed out that despite what many people think, if anyone is looking to get leaner the only way to do it is by lifting weights.

'I do feel cardio is important to keep your cardiovascular fitness ... For me I like to do intense sessions (a few times a week) to keep fit.' 

Ms Black was also a track and field athlete before she decided to take on the next challenge
