The Northern Territory is renowned for throwing up some mind-boggling moments but when ranger Paul O'Neill heard birds making a racket inside the Nitmiluk National Park, he went to investigate.

And what he found was one of those double-take moments, he looked as a large python wrapped itself around and began devouring a wallaby.

The NT Parks and Wildlife ranger quickly began to document the amazing scene on camera as the snake began swallowing the marsupial.

The Nitmiluk gorge site is some 30 kilometres from the heart of Katherine and 310 kilometres south of Darwin.

In the photos, the snake is first seen wrapping itself tightly around the marsupial to suffocate it. 

It then unhinges its jaw and starts working its mouth around its prey.

The mean feat is further exaggerated by the shape of wallaby's body jutting out while it is inside the snake's stomach.

The python has all but devoured the marsupial - but park officials say it could take up to seven days before it is fully digested

Greg Smith, from the Territory Wildlife Park, told ABC New s 'that wallaby would take about five to seven days to digest completely'

Greg Smith, from the Territory Wildlife Park, told ABC News 'that wallaby would take about five to seven days to digest completely and the snake would go and hide for at least a month'.

'Some snakes will start looking for food even if they are overweight and have just eaten, but on average that meal would be sufficient to sustain that snake for at least three months," he said. 

A python can survive on prey like a wallaby of this size for up to three months
