Predator: Stuart Hazell, Tia Sharp's murderer, looked up child pornography on his phone

Stuart Hazell was a pornography addict who downloaded sexually explicit pictures of children before he killed Tia Sharp and had relationships with both her mother and grandmother.

The 37-year-old was particularly looking for images of girls who looked like Tia, it has been revealed and was caught with 'extensive pornography' on a memory card which he had tried to hide from police.

He had also filmed the 12-year-old while she slept, and captured a video of her as she rubbed cream into her legs.

This morning Hazell pleaded guilty to
 Tia's murder, saying her family had 'suffered enough', after protesting
 his innocence for months and initially pleading not guilty.

When
 her body was found in his attic after she had been missing for a week, 
Hazell's DNA was on her clothes and Tia's blood was found on his belt, 
leading the prosecution to accuse him of sexually assaulting her before 
her death.

Today, a 
prosecutor told the court: 'We don't know and never will know exactly 
what took place in that house that night, but it's clear that Mr Hazell 
committed a significant sexual offence against her.'

Hazell
 first met Tia's grandmother Christine Bicknell around 2003 or 2004, 
when she was working as a barmaid at a pub in Merton, South London.

He then had a relationship with her daughter Natalie Sharp, Tia's mother, but it lasted no more than a couple of weeks.

Plea: Hazell in court today after pleading guilty to murder following weeks of denial

Shocking U-turn: Sobs and gasps could be heard in the public gallery as Hazell changed his plea to guilty

Hazell started seeing Ms Sharp in April 2007, and a month later moved into her house in New Addington.

In Ms Bicknell's statement last week, she spoke of Tia's closeness to Hazell and her love for him.

She said: 'When Tia went missing it didn't cross my mind that she could be dead. I always thought she was coming home. It didn't cross my mind that he would hurt her.

'He loved Tia, she idolised him. I love Stuart with all my heart, he was my world, but my grandchildren always came first.' 

Ms Bicknell said Hazell had shown no signs he couldn't be trusted around her.

Around the time of Tia's death her killer took to Google to look up pornographic pictures of young girls, police discovered after searching his house following his arrest last August.

Among the phrases searched for on Hazell's phone were 'naked little 
girlies', 'underage photos' and 'young girl nudes', the court heard.

He had also searched for terms like 'illegal underage incest pics', 'daddy daughter pictures' and 'little girls in glasses'.

Hazell apparently sought out images of girls who looked especially like Tia, wearing glasses and having their hair in a ponytail. 

Last week prosecutor Andrew Edis QC 
said: 'There are a number of professional-type pornographic photographs 
with young teenage girls wearing glasses while performing sexual acts.'

Hazell apparently acted out his fantasies by taking pictures of Tia. Police found 11 photographs and three video clips showing the girl sleeping on two memory cards hidden in his home.

At least one of the cards had been stashed in the doorway of a cupboard.

Police said they believed he had removed
 the bathroom door so he could spy on the girl, and modified the light 
socket in her room to create a 'spyhole'.

The most shocking image was taken after the schoolgirl's death, according to the prosecution.

It showed Tia naked lying on a bed, and was captured a few hours after she died for Hazell's 'sexual excitement', prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said during the trial.

He suffocated her and hid her body in Ms Bicknell's attic, then feigned ignorance for a week as the community rallied together to try and find her.

Ms Sharp fled from the Old Bailey courtroom in tears when the footage of her daughter was shown to jurors.

Hazell had also collected images of young girls being abused, and visited a site devoted to glorifying incest.

Forensic analysis of his mobile phone records showed that he had been looking up child pornography via Google.
