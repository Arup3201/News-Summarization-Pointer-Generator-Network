The mother of Wimbledon champion Andy Murray will today launch a thinly veiled attack on Alex Salmond’s ‘opportunist’ decision to we the Scottish flag at the end of her son’s historic win.

Judy Murray questions how the Scottish First Minister was even allowed to have the Saltire flag inside the Royal Box last year.

Speaking on Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs, she says: ‘Like most politicians they sense an opportunity and they go for it.

Opportunistic: Andy Murray's mother, Judy, questions how the Scottish First Minister was even allowed to have the Saltire flag inside the Royal Box last year

'But what I was wondering about was how he managed to get the flag in there because you are not really allowed to show support for one [player] or the other and you are not supposed to take flags in there... How did he manage that?’

Her comments come two weeks after her son said he ‘did not like it’ when Salmond unfurled the flag.

At the time Mr Salmond, who was sitting immediately behind David Cameron, said: ‘Anybody has got the right to wave the national flag. It’s a great way to celebrate this amazing triumph.’

Mrs Murray also tells presenter Kirsty Young she is ‘thankful’  that neither side in the Scottish independence debate has solicited her support and said: ‘I am going to absolutely sit on the fence.’
