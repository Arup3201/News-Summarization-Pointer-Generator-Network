High street brands such as Topshop and H&M have seen online sales of women's jeans to men rise by a third as guys buy ever-skinnier denims. 

While tight jeans have been part of the hipster uniform for a few years, a new sales spike indicates that men feel that the usual men's skinny cut just isn't tight enough.

The circulation-constricting legwear - dubbed the Ex-Girlfriend Jean - has been championed by the likes of Joey Essex, Harry Styles, Russell Brand and Jamie Hince.

Menswear expert Oliver Tezcan from online fashion store TheIdleMan.com said that skinny jeans hunters are disappointed by the conventional men's cut which is too loose at the ankle, calf and thighs, driving them to the women's section instead.

He said: 'High street retailers have seen a significant number of men in the past six months.

'These are guys who are buying women's skinny jeans for themselves so that they can have a super-skinny look.

'Admittedly, a lot of them are buying online rather than in-store, clearly to avoid the embarrassment of having to try on the jeans in a womenswear shop.' 

Oliver added: 'The reason for this pretty unusual move is that many high street menswear shops have failed to keep up with the increasing trend for even tighter jeans.

'Last season quite a few hipster jeans brands that we stock brought out super-skinny 'spray on' jeans and the demand for them was incredible and they sold out in a couple of weeks.

'The high-street wasn't as quick to pick up on this trend – which is much tighter at the ankle, calf and thighs and so a lot of male high-street shoppers are now having to buy the women's version instead to emulate the super-skinny style.'

Meanwhile, Jacques Chinnery, 20, a supermarket supervisor from Orpington, Kent who loves his Topshop MOTO Blue Black Baxter women's jeans in a waist size 30/30.

He said: 'The look is slimmer and tighter than the men's version. 

'They are skin-tight at the ankle, calf and thigh and there's actually more room at the front that some of the men's jeans, so they are pretty comfortable. 

'I wear them because I think they look better on than the mens' styles in the high street. 

'Some of the men's designer jeans brands have the super-skinny look but I can't always afford to buy designer ones, and no one can tell the difference anyway. 

'If I hadn't told you that these are girls' jeans you wouldn't know, it's not like they've got pink stitching or flowers on them.

'The only downside is that they are pretty hard to get on and off.'

The trend for skinny jeans has been in for some time now, starting around 2001, but recently styles got significantly tighter. 

It has previously been reported that Mr Styles likes to wear women's jeans designed by American brand Paige Denim. 

While Joey Essex has previously admitted that he also likes ladies legwear as it gives him a snugger fit than men's. 

Russell Brand is known for his love of skinny jeans although he has never revealed if they're women's or not

Joey Essex is a keen proponent of the super-skinny denim trend, wearing jeans that often look like leggings

In 2011 Levi's launched their own pair of 'ex-girlfriends jeans', inspired by the 'boyfriend jean', a looser fit for women based around the idea of female denim fans borrowing their other halves' jeans.  

The company used women's denim but tailored them to fit a man's body. 

However, this craze for super-skinny trousers could have some dangerous side effects.

A survey by incontinence brand TENA,  found that 10 per cent of British men said they had experienced unpleasant side effects from wearing tight jeans.

One quarter of the men experienced a bladder infection, one fifth had a twisted testicle, and low sperm count and fungal infections were also cited.
