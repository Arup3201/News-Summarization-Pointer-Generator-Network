June Churchill (pictured) feared her husband David was going to 'cut her head off' during a brutal and sustained attack at their home after he cut her neck with a rusty knife - her scars are clearly visible

A bullying husband who attacked his wife with an axe, sliced her neck with a rusty knife and kept her prisoner for days before setting fire to their home has been jailed for 17 years.

A court heard during the three-day ordeal June Churchill, who suffered a fractured skull, feared husband, David, 52, of Norfolk Road, Maghull, was going to 'cut her head off'.

She later described the incident as being like 'a horror film'. 

Liverpool Crown Court heard that the couple had been together for 12 years and married for ten but by the time of the offences were living separate lives under the same roof. 

Mrs Churchill described her husband as manipulative and previously violent towards her but did not tell police as she still loved him.

On September 29 this year they rowed about him wanting to move the television set into the garage.

Ian Criddle, prosecuting, said: 'He grabbed her by the throat, put her in a headlock and threw her onto the couch, pulled her hair and punched her to the face causing her lip to bleed. 

'He again threw her to the floor, threatening to kill her.'

The court heard Churchill was arrested and bailed on condition he did not approach his wife or enter the house where they lived.

But at midnight on  September 30, while Mrs Churchill was in bed asleep, he smashed his way into the home with an axe.

Mr Criddle said: 'He told her, "we can do this the hard way or we can do this the easy way."' 

Churchill then tied her ankles and wrists together, gagged her, blind folded her and struck her in the chest with the axe, causing a four inch open wound.

Hackney cab driver Churchill then frogmarched his  wife to the bathroom and made her sit on the toilet for 45 minutes, and hit her with the axe when she tried to escape.

Mr Criddle told the court: 'He stood behind her while she was on the toilet. He was holding a rusty Stanley knife and was slashing her on her back and throat.'

'He pressed the knife to her neck trying to cut it and when that did not work he tried again and this time split it open.

'She thought at that point he was going to cut her head off.'

When Mrs Churchill tried to escape she fell into the bath side and he hit her with the axe in the head.

The court heard he also attempted to gouge her eyes out with his thumbs.

Mr Criddle added: 'She feels lucky she wasn't blinded by that.'

Churchill then took her to the bedroom and tied her to the bed where she was 'tethered' for three days while she repeatedly pleaded with him not to kill her.

The court heard he 'dressed' her wounds using gaffer tape and a t-shirt and then spent his time playing poker on his computer and getting his finances in order.

At 3.40am on October 3 Churchill agreed to take her to hospital.

Mr Criddle said that Mrs Churchill, who is still visibly scarred, spent ten days in hospital and needed surgery under general anaesthetic. 

She suffered various lacerations, a fractured skull, spine, rib and eye socket.

But before taking her to the hospital, Churchill poured paint thinners around the house and set it alight causing major damage.

The blaze was spotted by passers-by who alerted the neighbours in the semi-detached house, John and Alison Cavanagh.

The court heard they woke up their young children and led them to safety but are still traumatised by their ordeal.

The fire spread to a neighbour's house, which is still in such bad condition they have been forced to move out

A victim impact statement by Mrs Cavanagh was read out in court and told how the couple had just finished refurbishing their home.

The house was so damaged by fire, smoke and water damage they have had to move out to rented accommodation and it will take nine months to repair.

Her statement said: 'He knew children were living next door but he set the house on fire. I thought I could trust him and I won't be so trusting in the future.'

She added that firefighters told her if the passers-by had not alerted her family they would not have got out in time.

The court heard that meanwhile there are problems with Churchill's insurers as the fire in his home had been started deliberately. 

Judge Brown told Churchill, who showed no emotion, 'It is very hard to imagine the horrendous ordeal she underwent and equally hard to appreciate the kind of consequences that your conduct has had in relation to her.' 

Nicholas Cockrell, defending, said that Churchill's health is deteriorating and he knows he may never leave prison.

Churchill pleaded guilty to arson being reckless whether life was endangered, falsely imprisoning and wounding June Churchill with intent, assaulting her by beating and cultivating cannabis. 

The court heard that he was on bail for growing 148 cannabis plants, with a potential street value of £54,000, at the time of the offences. 

Jailing David Churchill for a total of 17 years today Judge Mark Brown said: 'I am satisfied in setting the fire you were acting out of spite and maliciousness towards your wife.

'You can properly be described as a controlling, spiteful and violent bully. You subjected her to a brutal and horrendous ordeal.'
