Body parts have washed up on a New York beach sparking fears the skeletal remains belong to missing 14-year-old autistic boy Avonte Oquendo.

A torso, left arm, legs and a sneaker were found by a teenage girl on Thursday night on a beach at Hermon A. MacNeil Park in College Point, Queens, police said.

Recovered clothing, including jeans and sneakers, matched what the missing teenager was wearing on October 4 when he wandered away from the Riverview School in Long Island City.

Skeletal remains were found on a Queens beach on Thursday night and were removed by the medical examiner. There are fears that the body parts belong to missing teenager Avonte Oquendo

A police source confirmed the clothing matched what Avonte was wearing when he disappeared to the Wall Street Journal.

Oquendo family lawyer David Perecman also confirmed the pant and shoes sizes match what the 14-year-old was wearing the day he went missing.

The remains have been taken to the Queens County Morgue to be positively identified and a cause of death determined. The process could take several days. In the meantime, Harbor Patrol divers and helicopters are continuing to search the area.

The Oquendo family have been notified by the NYPD and are awaiting further information.

The remains were found at least nine miles from where the child was last seen.

For months, the boy's family has 
organized search parties to scour the city for him, placed missing 
posters on the subway and in stores and raising a $95,000 reward.

In particular, subway tunnels were hunted as the teenager is fascinated with the transit system. A recording of his mother's voice was even played over tannoys in the hope of reaching the boy.

The 14-year-old is particularly vulnerable because his type of autism leaves him unable to speak and in need of 24-hour care.

There have been a few sightings of teenage boys who closely resemble Avonte, raising the family's hopes - but he remains missing.

On January 5, the family posted a message on the Facebook page that they have set up to help find the boy pleading for FBI involvement.

The message thanked volunteers for their continued help in looking for the missing teen over the winter holidays.

The
 message continued: 'We would like to clarify that we have sought the 
help of the FBI and had petitioned them to take the lead in the 
investigation regarding Avonte.

'There
 are several legal reasons they gave us for not being legally permitted 
to take over the investigation. The most noted is that the NYPD has 
listed Avonte as a missing person, not a victim of kidnapping or other 
such federal offense(s) that would require the FBI's involvement.

'It is our deepest desire for the FBI to get involved but there is a 
system in place that requires protocol, we cannot force the FBI to get 
involved and we continually ask and pray they do.'

The Oquendo family
 were devastated by remarks made by former NYPD commissioner Ray Kelly 
in October where he said it was unlikely that the teenager would be 
found alive. Kelly has since apologized for his remarks.

Avonteâ€™s brother Danny Oquendo Jr has relocated from Florida to New York to drive the efforts to find his brother.

Thousands of followers have been added to Dannyâ€™s social media accounts 
and a Facebook page called Missing Avonte Oquendo has become a virtual 
hub for the search.

Facebook
 followers have helped get the missing boy's flier widely dispersed and 
have even had it translated into Chinese and Portuguese.

A Department of Education investigation has also taken place into how the autistic boy managed to get out of his special needs school and how teaching staff handled his disappearance.

Avonte's
 mother Vanessa, along with police, were not informed of his disappearance until
 at least an hour after he ran from the school building.

The
 school failed to go into lockdown mode while none of the administrators
 had passwords to access the surveillance cameras at the school on the 
day of Avonte's disappearance, according to Capital New York.

Without
 access to the security footage, school officials originally believed 
Avonte 'ran back up another staircase' and remained in the building.
