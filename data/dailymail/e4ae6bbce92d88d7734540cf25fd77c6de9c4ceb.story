Netherlands striker Robin van Persie has received the ultimate seal of approval after his 93-year-old grandfather joined in social media tributes to a stunning World Cup goal he scored.

Van Persie, 30, made an astonishing leaping header to score for the Dutch national side against Spain in a group stage match on Friday.

It was one of five goals scored against the defending champions, and is being heralded as one of the most impressive moments of the tournament so far.

The goal has also prompted a tide of copycat photographs from fans on social media - including the striker's own grandfather, Wim Ras.

Mr Ras took a picture of himself lying prone on his living room floor mimicking the pose, and later lavished praise on his grandson, who plays for Manchester United.

In an interview with Dutch news outlet Omroep Brabant, he said: 'I thought it was a great landing. I have done gymnastics before but those moves are choreographed. Robin had just a fraction of a second to jump.â€™

He was hardly alone in his appreciation for the goal, which has inspired the #Persieing hashtag on Twitter.

The eventful game last Friday was Spain's leaviest loss in decades - and particularly galling after their triumph in the 2010 World Cup.

The defending champions took an early lead after a dubious penalty but it wasn't long before the Dutch equalised and began their rout.

The Dutch took revenge with two goals each for Van Persie and Robben and one by Stefan de Vrij.

Spain have won the last three major football tournaments they have played in, wining the European Championships in 2008 and 2012 as well as the 2010 World Cup.

Spain, also 2008 and 2012 European champions, took a 27th-minute lead through a Xabi Alonso penalty after Brazilian-born striker Diego Costa went down under a challenge from de Vrij, only for Van Persie to equalise brilliantly in the 44th minute.

The Dutch forward stole in between Sergio Ramos and Jordi Alba to meet a searching Daley Blind cross with a powerful diving header that left goalkeeper Iker Casillas rooted.

Moments before Van Persie's goal Spain missed a chance to double their lead when midfielder David Silva's cheeky chip was pushed wide for a corner.

After the break the Dutch poured forward and went ahead after 53 minutes when Robben got on the end of another superb Blind lobbed pass before turning Gerard Pique and holding off Sergio Ramos to fire home from seven metres.

The match opened up but in the Netherlands' favour with De Vrij stealing in on 64 minutes at the back post to convert a free kick after Van Persie put Casillas under pressure.

It got worse for Spain as Van Persie added a fourth after taking advantage of a sloppy touch by Casillas to slot home in the 72nd minute and Robben stunned a raucous crowd as he toyed with the Spanish defence and Casillas before belting home in the 80th.

The defeat was the heaviest yet for Spain under coach Vicente Del Bosque.
