Tracey McLaughlin underwent gastric bypass surgery in December 2010, weighing 19st. She is now underweight and only weighs 5st 7lbs

A woman who underwent gastric bypass surgery has so lost so much weight she fears she might starve to death.

Tracey McLaughlin, 51, underwent gastric bypass surgery in December 2010, weighing 19st.

She is only 4ft 10ins and was so overweight that she was confined to a wheelchair with crippling arthritis.

She had the surgery after being told that her health was in danger, Closer reports.

The mother-of-two lost 10st within a year of having the operation and was then happy with her weight.

However, she has continued to lose weight rapidly and has shrunk to just 5st 7lbs and has a BMI of 16 – the healthy range is 18.5 to 25.

Ms McLaughlin, from Manchester, is now so weak that she is mainly bedridden and she has been told that if she continues to lose weight she could die.

She has to wear clothes meant for 10 to 11-year-old children.

She told Closer: ‘Having a gastric bypass was the biggest mistake I’ve ever made. Although I had health problems, I was happy being big.

‘Now I spend my days in bed watching TV and can’t go to the shops alone.’

Doctors are still trying to establish why Ms McLaughlin is losing so much weight.

They believe that scar tissue in her stomach could be affecting the cells that absorb food.

Ms
McLaughlin explained that she tries to eat fattening foods such as 
bacon sandwiches, Chinese takeaways and biscuits but that this is not 
resolving the problem.

She says that she cannot bear looking in the mirror because her ribs are protruding and her eyes are sunken.

She told Closer: ‘My body is emaciated. I’m terrified I could starve to death.’

Ms McLaughlin says she was happier before she had the surgery and that it was the biggest mistake she has ever made. She has been warned that if she loses any more weight she may need to be put on a drip

Ms McLaughlin, whose children Liam and Louise are in their 20s, started to pile on the pounds when she was in her 30s.

She says that she would eat two pies 
and two cakes in the morning, cheese on toast for lunch, a sausage roll,
fish and chips for supper, and then snack on biscuits.

Despite her weight, she was happy and was proud of her larger figure.

However, she began to experience problems when she was in her 40s and was a size 26.

Her
joints were being put under so much pressure by her weight that she 
developed crippling arthritis and was told she would be in a wheelchair 
for the rest of her life unless she lost weight.

When diets failed to shift the excess pounds, she was offered gastric bypass surgery.

She says that after the surgery she dropped quickly to a size 10 and felt healthy so decided she did not want to lose any more weight.

However, she continued to lose weight despite eating as much as she could.

She has undergone a CT scan which failed to reveal what the problem is.

She will now have more tests to help doctors establish why she has become so thin.

Ms McLaughlin has been told that if she keeps losing weight she may soon have to be placed on a drip to ensure that she gets enough nutrients.

A gastric bypass is a last resort for people carrying a dangerous amount of weight.

It is available on the NHS for people who have a BMI of more than 40, or for those with a BMI of more than 35 who also have a serious weight-related health condition.

During the operation the digestive system is re-routed past most of the patient's stomach so that they digest less food and feel full quicker.

The patient is left with just a small pouch in place of their stomach.

After the surgery, people tend to lose weight very quickly - most people who have had this procedure lose two thirds of their excess body weight.

Patients have to stick to a strict diet and exercise plan after the operation.

Many people find that they are left with lose folds of skin after they lose weight - this can require further surgery to correct.

Gastric bypass surgery comes with many potentially fatal risks, including internal bleeding and blood clots.

One in 100 gastric bypass surgery patients die shortly after surgery.

The surgery cannot be reversed.
