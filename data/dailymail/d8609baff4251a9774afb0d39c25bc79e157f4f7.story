Survey reveals 43 per cent of women think erotic fiction makes their own sex lives seem routine and boring

Backs up Fifty Shades of Grey author EL James' theory that her books provide readers with a 'holiday from their husbands'

Good read: Nearly half of women surveyed said erotic fiction was more exciting than their own sex lives (posed by model)

Thanks to the discretion of e-readers and recently released books like the Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy, erotic fiction is soaring in popularity.

Incredibly, the past-time has become so popular that nearly half of women would rather read an erotic book than have sex themselves, according to a new poll.

A survey by online bingo site Dotty Bingo found 44 per cent of women preferred reading about the (often fictional) erotic adventures of others over taking part in their own sex lives.

Of the 400 women polled – all aged between 25 and 50 -  43 per cent said books such as the Fifty Shades trilogy by EL James made their own love lives seem routine and boring.

They cited ease, a lack of energy and lack of imagination in the bedroom as reasons why their sexual encounters paled in comparison to sex scenes they'd read.

Nearly all of those 
quizzed (91 per cent) said they had read at least one erotic book, with more 
than two thirds (68 per cent) stating that they would like to do so more often.

One respondent, who didn’t want to be 
named, said: 'I'd much rather read about it then do it. It's always
 exciting in a book and, unlike in real life, the hero never rolls off 
when he’s finished and starts snoring without so much as a cuddle.'

A spokesperson from DottyBingo.com said the results came as a surprise.

They said: 'Erotic reading has shot to 
prominence recently and with the rise of the e-reader never before has 
it been easier to covertly read a racy novel in public. 

'Ease was the main reason cited for this
 as you can, understandably, have a book on hand more often than your 
partner. Others liked the imagination and variety the books offered.'

One person who won't be surprised by the survey is English mother-of-two Erika Mitchell, 49, who has written the erotic Fifty Shades trilogy using the pen name EL James.

The first book in the series has just become the fastest selling paperback of all time in the UK, out-selling Harry Potter and The Da Vinci Code.

She describes her books as 'romantic fantasy' stories, which offer women a 'holiday from their husbands' and has received letters from fans crediting her books with saving their marriages by spicing up their sex lives.
