Janna Bullock, 45, is wanted in Russia for allegations of fraud

A New York socialite is wanted in Russia for using a network of offshore companies to defraud banks in Cyprus,

Janna Bullock, 45, is a Russian-born real estate developer and art scene fixtue, who moved to the US with her now ex-husband, Alexei Kuznetsov, a former Moscow bank executive and government official.

But last week a courtroom in Aix-en-Provence, France order Mr Kuznetsov to be extradited from the country as prosecutors in Russia look to charge him with 150 counts of fraud and seek damages 
that could total 11 billion rubles ($333 million).

Kuznetsov was arrested was detained on 
July 5 in a hotel in Gassin, not far from Saint-Tropez, and placed in 
custody in the Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur Region in southern France.

He faces life in prison if he is found guilty.

Russian prosecutors also asked the French judge to issue a warrant for Bullock, and she could face serious charges, as well.

She and Kuznetsov are accused in a separate civil suit of using a network of offshore companies to defraud banks in Cyprus.

Sources familiar with the French legal system told the Page Six it will take many months before Kuznetsov is extradited, and that Bullock, an American citizen, mat never be served with a warrant.

Ms Bullock, who has been married four times, grew up in St. Petersburg and taught Russian literature to high school students.

She moved to the New York in 1990 and worked as a paralegal.

The Independent reported that she met Alexey Kuznetsov when she was dispatched by the firm to collect him from JFK airport.

At the time, she was reportedly married to her second husband, an American, who with she  has a 24-year-old daughter, Zoe Remmel.

Mr
 Kuznetsov had a Bulgarian wife, but the pair 'became friendly right 
away', a source told the New York Post, and before long they were 
married - they have a daughter Eugenia Bullock, 15.

Her daughter's 2008 wedding drew a lot of scrutiny as reports suggested the final fee hit $5million.

Ms Bullock said in an interview last year with the New York Times: 'It may look expensive, but I’m extremely cost conscious with everything I do.'

According to the New York society pages, Ms Bullock seen here with a friend,  married again in 2013 – this time to her art adviser Randall Brockett

Ms Bullock became a property developer buying luxury developments in New York, Paris and the Alpine resort of Courchevel.

She told The New York Times that her empire was at one stage worth $2bn.

Over a decade she climbed New York’s social ladder, becoming a trustee of the Guggenheim Museum, which noted in its 2007 announcement of her election that she had amassed 'more than 4000 works by Russian artists from the late 19th century to the present day' as well as '400 works by Western contemporary artists.'

But she stepped down from the Guggenheim board in 2010.

Ms Bullock hasn’t been back to Russia for years - she once made a motorcycle trip from St. Petersburg to Moscow with Dennis Hopper and Jeremy Irons.

MailOnline has requested a comment from Ms Bullock.
