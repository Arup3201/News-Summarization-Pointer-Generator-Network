Authorities in Northern California are investigating an altercation between a police officer and a man in a wheelchair that was captured on video and circulated online.

A San Francisco police officer is seen in the video apparently trying to push the man, DeVaughn 'Bo' Frierson, and his wheelchair off the curb of a sidewalk.

The wheelchair almost tips over, but it remained upright and a seat belt kept Frierson in his chair. The officer can be heard complaining that the wheelchair ran over his foot.

Upset: Wheelchair-bound DeVaughn Frierson has said he wants the officers stripped of their badges 

The incident occurred Sunday afternoon while police were responding to a disturbance. Four men were issued citations.

A police spokesman declined to identify the officer involved and says the department is investigating the incident.

'I'm waiting for the police officers - for them to get removed from the force,' Frierson told CBS San Francisco.

The news outlet reported that Frierson has claimed his relatives were playing around, and he went toward the police after a cousin was put in handcuffs.

'I was going over there to be a witness because my cousin was getting beat up by the police,' Frierson told the affiliate station. 'When I went over there they stopped that and focused on me.'

CBS Francisco pointed out that two  videos of the incident have emerged - one was posted by 'Sqaully Dee' on Facebook, and a second video appeared on YouTube filmed by Edwardo Delacruz.

In Delacruz's video, the officer can be heard saying 'You f****** ran my foot over.'

'You don't run my foot over,' the officer says.

'F*** your foot,' Frierson says. 'You don't do a handicapped person like that.'

Delacruz told The Free Thought Project, 'The guy in the wheelchair and the guy sitting on the ground are my cousins. The police are community police, they know everyone in the neighborhood.'

The website, which is critical of alleged cases of police brutality and excessive force, reported that 'The men were joking around as Frierson did wheelies and tricks in his chair and the man on the ground playfully called the police over to come arrest the man for messing around.' 

'Basically the cops harassed them because they were joking around,' Delacruz told The Free Thought Project. 'The thing about it is the cops were telling them to go in the house and his house is 5 doors up. He has to roll past them to get in the house and they know all this because they are the community police. Their office is right there too, so they know where everyone lives because they see them everyday.'

'If you look at the video, [the officer] doesn't jump or react in a way that a person [would] who just had their foot ran over,' Delacruz also said. 'He said that when he realized he was being filmed. He tried to flip him because he didn’t like my cousin confronting him about slamming my other cousin on his head.He didn't like the truth being told to him, so he tried to flip him out of the chair. That's what the conversation he and the cop were having prior to the cop grabbing his chair.'

SFPD spokesman Officer Grace Gatpandan told CBS San Francisco police allegedly saw a verbal dispute between a group of individuals.

Gatpandan told the news outlet that three people received possession of open containers of alcohol citations, while one person received an obstructing an officer citation.
