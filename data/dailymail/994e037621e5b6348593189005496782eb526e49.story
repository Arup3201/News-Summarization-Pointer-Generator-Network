A  911 recording played in court this week sheds light on the final moments of a 32-year-old man who was fatally shot in the head in his girlfriend's bedroom by her father who claims to have confused him for an intruder.

Charles Jordan, 41, appeared in court on Wednesday  to face charges of voluntary manslaughter and a weapons offense in the shooting of 20-year-old daughter Brenda's boyfriend Marc Carrion.

Carrion was shot dead in September after Jordan heard a noise coming from his daughter's room, and he grabbed his gun to investigate.

The 911 recording played in court this week was so tragic, it shocked the judge.

Tragic moment: Charles Jordan, 41 (left), shot dead 32-year-old Marc Carrion (right) in September because he thought he was an intruder. Carrion was dating Jordan's 20-year-old daughter Brenda, who let him into the apartment 

In a relationship: Investigators say Brenda and Carrion had been seeing each other for a week, and that Carrion had been supplying drug-addict Brenda with heroin. Ten to 15 bags of the substance was found in her bed 

Shared apartment: This is the apartment where Brenda and her father lived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Carrion and his mother lived right around the block 

'Don't you move! I will shoot you!' Jordan can be heard screaming as he called police just before midnight on September 15.

Carrion, who was kneeling next to girlfriend Brenda's bed, is heard replying that 'I have to stand up'. 

That's when gunshots ring out and Jordan's daughter stars shrieking.

'He moved, he moved!' Jordan tells the dispatcher.  

'Dad, he's dead!' his daughter screams, who refers to carrion as 'my boyfriend'.

'I've never seen him before,' Jordan explains to the dispatcher. 

At the end of the five minute call, Municipal County Judge James DeLeon expressed his shock. 

'That's crazy,' he said. 'It sounds like something from West Side Story.' 

DeLeon added that he was surprised that Jordan was allowed to remain free on bail. 

Gone: Jordan faces charges of voluntary manslaughter and a weapons violation. Carrion (left) died after being transported to the hospital for a gunshot wound to the head. His girlfriend Brenda's (right) whereabouts are now not known

'Shot him because he moved. People move,' he noted from his chair. 

Jordan remained quiet in court on Wednesday, wearing a blue-collared shirt, tie and gray slacks. He exited with his defense attorney Todd Henry and a few supporters. 

Investigators say Brenda and Carrion had been seeing each other for about a week. It's also believed that Brenda is a drug addict, and Carrion her supplier. About 10 to 15 bags of heroin were found in her bed, and PCP found in Carrions body after an autopsy. Brenda's current whereabouts are unknown. 

Carrions mother Gloria Moyett admits that her son had a drug dealing past, but says he was trying to turn his life around. 

The mother and son lived just around the block from the Jordan home in Holme Circle Apartments. 

‘He's with your daughter, she's not screaming, and you shoot him just because you don't know him?’Moyett remarked to the Philadelphia Daily News.  

Carrion is survived by three young children from a previous relationship.
