A Scottish man's thong made entirely of loom bands is is back on sale on eBay after it was taken down by the online auction site for the advertisement being too racy.

Sam Innes, from Musselburgh outside Edinburgh, created the underwear or swimwear with his own hands out of loom bands.

But when the 22-year-old listed the item for sale on eBay, modelling the garment himself, is was deemed to have breached the site's nudity laws.

Looming over: Sam Innes made this 'loom-kini' out of colourful loom bands and hopes to sell it on eBay

Too much skin: Innes's original advertisement showed more of his figure than eBay allows

Censored: The 'loomkini' is back on sale with the auction's starting price set at £30

It's back up for auction though with the item on its lonesome, and listed as 'new without tags' since it was handmade.

'So here's my invention of the loom-kini!' he posts on his ad. 'Was tricky but I got there. Please appreciate the time and effort I made to do this! Get bidding everyone!'

Unfortunately for Sam, he's yet to receive a bid for the item which has a starting price of £30 - the auction closes on Friday at 3.24pm.

It's sale at that price would yield a £24 profit on the colourful rubber bands he used to create it but not factoring in what he says was 24 hours in labour.

The price is modest considering the recent £170,000 sale of a girl's dress made of loom bands.

Helen Smith, from North Wales, put the dress made by her friend Katherine Burnand on eBay - modelled by her 12-year-old daughter Sian - and it attracted 137 bids from around the world.

Its starting price was £50 before it skyrocketed.

'It’s definitely a bedroom kind of piece, I think,' he told the Mirror. 'But if someone was so inclined, I’m sure they could wear it in public.' 

Sold! Sian Smith models the dress made from 24,000 loom bands which sold last night on eBay for £170,000

Final bid! The auction ended at 5.13pm yesterday and a total of 137 people put their hat in the ring

Shocked: Helen Smith, 42, put the dress, made entirely from loom bands by her friend Katherine, on eBay
