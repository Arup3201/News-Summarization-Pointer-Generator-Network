Arrest: Deandre Kelley has been charged with reckless homicide

A Cincinnati man who shot his 11-year-old daughter on Sunday has been asked to be let out of jail so he can attend her funeral.

Deandre Kelley is facing charges of reckless homicide after Shanti Lanza was hit by a bullet he allegedly fired into the air outside her house.

The 34-year-old had been arguing with Shanti's mother, Kristina Lanza, and didn't realize their daughter had been shot until later in the day.

Kelley, who is being held on $500,000 bond, was allegedly drunk when he arrived at the couple's Sedamsville home at about 2am.

Shanti was hiding in her bedroom while her parents argued outside, but she was hit by a stray bullet as Kelley allegedly fired four times into the air, police told ABC5.

Kelley's attorney, Hugh McCloskey Jr, said the death appeared to be an accident and appealed for his client to be allowed to attend the funeral for Shanti on Saturday.

'At the request of Shantiâ€™s family, [I] filed this Motion seeking an Order from this Court allowing Mr Kelley a furlough from the Hamilton County Justice Center in order to participate, in any manner that this Court deems appropriate and under the supervision of the appropriate law enforcement,' he wrote.

A judge is expected to rule today on whether Kelley, who could be facing up to three years in prison, will be allowed to attend the service.

Antwone Kelley said his brother had left the family's home unaware that his daughter had been shot.

'He might drink a little bit but that 
was his child, that was his baby. He didn't mean to do this at all. He's
 more heartbroken than anybody,' he said.

Final farewell: A funeral for 11-year-old Shanti is due to be held on Saturday. Kelley has asked a judge if he can be let out of jail to say goodbye to his daughter

Crime scene: Four shots were fired outside Shanti Lanza's home on Sunday

Emergency services were called to the house at 3am on Sunday after Shanti was found bleeding in her bedroom. She had been hit in the chest.

Her parents had been together for about 15 years, but had a troubled relationship, family members said. Kelley had been arrested for a domestic disturbance involving Shanti's mother in 2007.

Vince Lanza, Shantiâ€™s uncle, said: 'It was one of those relationships that they can't be together but they can't be without each other.'

A fund has been set up to help the family cover funeral costs for Shanti.
