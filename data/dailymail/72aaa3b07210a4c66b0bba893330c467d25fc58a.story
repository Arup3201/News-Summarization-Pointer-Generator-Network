Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne has put his luxury home up for sale following his divorce from his second wife.

The gym entrepreneur said he wants to
start a 'new chapter' in his life and his five-bedroom home on the 
exclusive Wynard development in County Durham has been put on the market
for £875,000.

The Californian-style property, with white exterior, boasts views over a golf course and has a large open kitchen and a games room.

Duncan Bannatyne is selling his home on the exclusive Wynard estate and has put it on the market for £875,000

The luxury house boasts a 19ft living room, games room and views over the estate's golf course

The decision to sell comes after Bannatyne and his wife Joanne McCue divorced last year

The home also has a 19ft maple-floored lounge and an entrance hall with a double-height glazed apex.

Upstairs there is another living room and three of the bedrooms are en suite, with the master bedroom also boasting a dressing room and a double whirlpool-style bath.

Bannatyne, 64, who is worth an estimated £430million, is selling up following the break-up of his marriage to second wife Joanne in December 2011.

In October he was taken to hospital with chest pains, although tests showed he had not suffered a heart attack.

He has not decided whether he will leave Wynyard or find somewhere else handy for his headquarters in Darlington.

He said: 'I decided to sell as I am looking to start a new chapter in my life.

'I am undecided at this time as to whether I will purchase another house in Wynyard or whether I will move out of Wynyard.

'I think I will probably move out of Wynyard but will make that decision as and when I need to.'

The house has been the venue for some great parties, he said, and a source of peace for him too.

'It is modern living at its easiest with beautiful views of the golf course.

'It is a very relaxing house to live in, although it is also a very fun house and I have hosted great parties in it.

'I
love spending my time in the kitchen. I have a huge sofa in the 
kitchen, where I can kick off my shoes watch TV, cook or simply watch 
what's happening on the golf course, and it's a fabulous area and 
definitely my favourite part of the house,' he said.

'There is no hustle and bustle. When you have had hard day at the office you can come home and relax but equally should you want company you can always drop in on a neighbour for a coffee and catch up.'

The house is for sale through estate agent Manners and Harrison.

Bannatyne is one of the stars of the hit BBC show Dragons' Den where business people pitch ideas to would-be investors.

'The best thing about living in this house is the peace and quiet,' he said.

'Living in Wynyard is great. I have the best neighbours anyone can ask for and there is a real community spirit going on.

'The best thing about Wynyard is the people who live there.'
