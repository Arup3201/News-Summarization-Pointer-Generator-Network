Ofcom chief executive Ed Richards will step down from his £393,000-a-year job at the end of the year, he announced yesterday.

The former adviser to Tony Blair, who applied unsuccessfully to lead the BBC in 2012, said it was ‘the right time to move on’ after eight years at the helm of the broadcasting regulator.

Mr Richards, 49, has not lined up another job and will not be able to work for another organisation in the broadcasting or telecoms sector for 12-months after his departure without the approval of Ofcom’s chairman Dame Patricia Hodgson, to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest.

During Mr Richards’ tenure, Ofcom has repeatedly been accused of being too lenient on broadcasters who upset viewers with lewd or violent programmes.

Last year, campaigners said the regulator was ‘out of touch’ after it failed to take action over a string of controversies.

Simon Cowell’s shows The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent have repeatedly been cleared by Ofcom despite attracting hundreds of complaints.

In October last year, The X Factor results show sparked 317 complaints when singer Lady Gaga stripped to her underwear before the watershed and posed suggestively.

Cleared: Ofcom also cleared a BBC Comic Relief broadcast, in which Rowan Atkinson dressed as the Archbishop of Canterbury and gave a fireside homily in which he exhorted viewers not to 's*** your neighbour'

Even though the episode was watched by nearly a million children and prompted fury from campaigners, Ofcom decided not to investigate, saying it had not broken its broadcasting code.

The same year, it also cleared an offensive BBC Comic Relief broadcast, in which comic Rowan Atkinson dressed as Church of England leader Justin Welby and gave a fake fireside homily in which he exhorted viewers not to ‘s*** your neighbour’ and to ‘give us your bloomin’ wonga’. 

Ofcom have now hired headhunters Zygos to find a replacement. Culture Secretary Sajid Javid must approve the candidate.

Mr Richards’ departure comes at a significant time ahead of the 2015 general election and doubts about the governance of the BBC, which Ofcom does not regulate at present.

The Conservative Party warned it would curb Ofcom’s power before the 2010 general election, but Mr Richards appeased some critics by slashing its operating costs by a third.

During his tenure as Ofcom chief executive, he was involved in the row over Rupert Murdoch’s abortive bid to buy all of BskyB and claimed to have pushed down broadband and phone call prices.

But he was criticised by some for his huge pay package, which included a £284,000 salary, a £30,000 bonus, plus a generous pension and other benefits.

The announcement came as his partner, Delyth Evans, steps up her campaign to become a Labour MP at the forthcoming election. A former Welsh Assembly member, Miss Evans stood down as chief executive of the charity Dress for Success earlier this year to become candidate for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire.

Yesterday, Mr Richards said: ‘It has been a privilege to lead Ofcom during such an exciting and dynamic period in the evolution of the UK’s communications sector.

‘It is never easy leaving a job that you enjoy greatly but I have always felt that once I had completed eight years as chief executive this would be the right time to move on.’ 

In 2012, Mr Richards applied to replace Mark Thompson as director general of the BBC. He missed out to George Entwistle, who resigned after just 54 days following the Jimmy Savile and Lord McAlpine Newsnight scandals.

Dame Hodgson said: ‘Ed has been an outstanding chief executive. Under his leadership, Ofcom has helped to deliver superfast broadband, 4G, lower prices, innovation, competition, and sustainable public service broadcasting in the UK. He leaves an impressive legacy. On behalf of the board I would like to thank him for his enormous contribution.’ 

A spokesman for Ofcom said: 'When broadcasters break the rules, we take robust action to protect audiences, and we continuously monitor audience attitudes to ensure our regulations are in line with people’s expectations. 

'Ofcom has fined broadcasters more than £15m in the past decade.’
