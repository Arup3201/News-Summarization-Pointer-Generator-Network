A father-of-three with motor neurone disease, whose ventilator prevents him from being able to speak, has been given the opportunity to communicate independently for the first time in 15 years.

Technology and media company, Not Impossible Labs, which was founded by Melbourne born Elliot Kotek and Mick Ebeling from Arizona, made it their mission to ensure Don Moir was able to independently renew his vows on his 25th wedding anniversary with his wife Lorraine.

A short documentary explaining the trials and tribulations of their project, captured the heart-warming moment the farmer from rural Canada was able to write his wife a love letter and tell her he loves her for the first time in 15 years.

Don Moir, a father-of-three with motor neurone disease, was able to independently tell his wife he loved her for the first time in 15 years 

Mr Moir was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 1995. The disease forced him to rely on a wheelchair and in 1999 he was fitted with a ventilator to help him breathe.

'I'm not even sure he realised that he wasn't going to be able to speak, but I remember explaining that to him: "if you go on the ventilator, you won't be able to speak anymore",' Lorraine said.

'At that point, it was very difficult.'

Don's family did their best to adapt to his progressive illness and learnt how to run the family farm according to his instructions, but they remain humble about the emotional toll it has taken on them. 

'He's constantly losing abilities every week, like what he could do last week he can't do this week and next week you know it's going to be something else, but you don't know what,' Lorraine said.

Engineer and Not Impossible volunteer Javed Gangjee was determined to help Don communicate independently after hearing his story, but was set back due to the farmer's lack of experience with technology.

His wife explains in the documentary: 'Don has never touched a computer, he doesn't even know how to turn one on'.

Undeterred, Mr Gangjee said: 'a year ago I made Don a promise; that I will find an answer that works for him specifically.'

'When I look at Don - that could be my uncle, that could be my dad - what right do I have to do nothing about it.'

The Not Impossible team thus created an electronic version of a letter-board chart that Don and his wife had been using to communicate since he first lost the ability to speak. 

'I'm not even sure he realised that he wasn't going to be able to speak, but I remember explaining that to him... at that point, it was very difficult,' his wife Lorraine said

'Don had a letter board that was divided up into four quadrants that enabled him to have a bit of shorthand with his wife and kids because when he looked into the corner on the left it could only be a certain letter that fit to form a certain word,' Elliot Kotek told Daily Mail Australia.

'Due to his technology barrier, the program gave him a very familiar thing to look at because it looked just like his letter sheet and it would calibrate, so it would scroll through these letters and if he then looks to the centre it pulls the letter in to the centre. 

'Not only does it speak the word or sentence for him, but it has got predictive text, just like our phones do, which continues to get smarter like our phones do, and that speeds up his communication.

'It's a new piece of technology also based on eye recognition and it's really the software that's the hero here.' 

After almost three years of development the program was finally complete in August 2014 and Don was able to renew his vows.

'Don has never touched a computer, he doesn't even know how to turn one on,' Lorraine said

'My dear Lorraine, I can't imagine life without you. You have made the last 25 years fly by and the last 20 with ALS more bearable. I am looking forward to the next 25 years. Love Don.'

'He was pretty excited. Lorraine told us: "he's blinking like crazy!",' Mr Kotek said. 

But the beauty of the program does not stop there.

The tech geniuses are now working on designing a voice based on Don's actual voice from old film footage of him in order to personalise the computer's voice and minimise the robotic sounds. 

'The next stage they're working on is for him to be able to email from the device so that he can keep in contact with friends and people you don't get to see because you're not as mobile as you used to be. He'll be able to communicate with anyone in the world and not just the two people in the room with him,' Mr Kotek said.

The program is based on his letter sheet and calibrates - scrolling through letters and pulling them into the centre when he looks into the centre. It then speaks the word or sentence for him and also includes predictive text which continues to get smarter and speeds up his communication

Not Impossible Labs will also have the program available for download online by anyone, for free. 

'Javed wants to go around the whole country making custom interfaces for all sorts of people. Like, for someone with tunnel vision, he wants to customise the program for them,' Mr Kotek said.

'Don has Lorraine, but not everyone has a Lorraine. We want people to look at all the technology available to them and know that they can use it and adapt it to make life a lot easier and convenient. We still are a really small team of people and we manage to deliver real impact on people's lives and if we can inspire others to help someone in their community then it's huge.

'If we can make it downloadable to use for free then others can look at it and improve it so that there are local answers for people who are lacking communication tools.' 

Don's Voice is just one of many projects that Not Impossible currently has in the works. Their process of helping people is a simple one: find a problem, solve it by bringing together the best creative minds, get big companies involved to fund the set up costs in exchange for exposure, make it a sustainable solution and then spread the message far and wide.

The program allowed Don to independently renew his vows on his 25th wedding anniversary with Lorraine

'What happens is, people send us stories or we find stories where access has been limited to someone,' Mr Kotek explained. 

'It could be physical limitations, like an inability to communicate, it could be geographic, or it could just be financial where the solution is not available because it's just so expensive they can't afford it.

As for Don and Lorraine, while his independence has bene given a boost, the technology is only another chapter in their love story.

'When he first used the program to say "I love you", Lorraine said to us: "Oh, you know, he tells me he loves me all the time",' Mr Kotek said.

'They really are amazing. Her resolve is incredible. It's hard to believe but they seem to really not have missed a beat.'
