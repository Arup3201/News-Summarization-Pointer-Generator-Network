A 22-year-old has given birth to a healthy baby girl who grew outside her womb.

The woman, in Tanzania, only discovered when she was 32 weeks pregnant that her baby was developing in her abdomen.

It is thought that the fertilised egg initially implanted in her fallopian tube from where it was expelled, allowing it to implant again in her abdomen.

The woman was referred to a hospital in Mwanza, Tanzania, after complaining of abdominal pain and noticing that her baby was not moving very much.

She also reported having difficulty urinating, according to a report of her case in the journal BioMed Central.

She had already had two antenatal check-ups after which she was told the pregnancy was progressing normally.

She had an ultrasound scan in Mwanza which appeared to be normal and doctors assumed the pregnancy was textbook but that the mother had anaemia and a urinary tract infection.

An abdominal pregnancy is a form of ectopic pregnancy.

Ectopic pregnancies occur when a fertilised egg implants outside the womb - usually in the fallopian tubes, but occasionally in the abdomen.

Abdominal pregnancies usually occur as a result of a fallopian tube rupturing or expelling a fertilised egg that has first implanted in the tube.

Unlike with other ectopic 
pregnancies, there is a chance that a viable baby will be born following
 an abdominal pregnancy but there is also an increased risk of the 
mother dying.

Abdominal pregnancies are thought to account for about one in every 10,000 pregnancies.

But they are dangerous as they can cause severe bleeding in the 
mother.

A woman with an abdominal pregnancy will not be able to give birth naturally and the baby will have to be delivered surgically.

If this does not happen, the baby will die and can become calcified inside the mother.

Babies born after abdominal pregnancies 
have a high rate of birth defects because they can be compressed as a 
result of there being no amniotic fluid as a protective buffer.

They treated her for these conditions and her symptoms eased a little.

However, a second scan two days later showed that the womanâ€™s baby was actually floating in her abdominal cavity.

The patient was found to be carrying a viable baby even though it was not in a protective amniotic sac and was not surrounded by the normal amniotic fluid.

She was also noted to have a normal, but empty, womb and normal ovaries and fallopian tubes.

The baby was successfully delivered during surgery.

The little girl weighed 3lbs 7oz (1.7kg).

The mother had to be given a blood transfusion because she had severe anaemia but she and the baby were both discharged from hospital healthy.

Abdominal pregnancies are rare forms of ectopic pregnancies which occur when the baby implants in the abdomen instead of the womb.

They are often not picked up on ultrasound scans and usually occur as a result of a fallopian tube rupturing or expelling a fertilised egg that has implanted in the tube.

Babies born after abdominal pregnancies have a high rate of birth defects because they can be compressed as a result of there being no amniotic fluid as a protective buffer.

'I've seen maybe four or five abdominal pregnancies over the course of 25 years,' Dr Jill Rabin, chief of ambulatory care, obstetrics and gynecology at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New York, told Live Science.

She added: 'It's very rare, but you have to keep it in your mind when examining a pregnant woman who has abdominal pain.'
