Adrenaline junkies might have mastered skiing downhill at mind-boggling speeds, but a new invention could challenge them to ski uphill too.

A group of skiing enthusiasts from Colorado have come up with a parachute-like contraption that lets people ski uphill with the help of wind, in an activity they have dubbed ‘wind mountaineering’.

UpSki’s device, which includes a large round sail measuring 194 sq ft (18 sq m), enables skiers and snowboarders wearing a specially-designed harness to power up mountains. It weighs just four-and-a-half kilos and can be packed away into a backpack.

The UpSki kit includes:

The company is currently raising money to put its kit into production on Kickstarter, where it is selling a complete UpSki package for $2,400.

UpSki said: ‘With skis or snowboard, we harness the wind for an uphill ride - powerful enough for exhilarating speed, yet precise and controllable for manoeuvring and stopping.’

A harness is worn by the skier or boarder to transmit the UpSki's 'pull' to the user and there is a safety release

The equipment is designed to keep the user 
on the ground and can be deflated instantly, which is essential to stay 
safe in especially windy or rugged environments.

A harness is worn by the skier or boarder to transmit the UpSki’s ‘pull’ to the user and there is a safety release.

A ‘control centre’ clips to the harness and allows people to steer and control the contraption to ski uphill using a system of lines.

The company said anyone can use an UpSki but 'prior skiing experience and good fitness is preferable’.

UpSki has until December 20 to raise 
the $11,200 it has requested for to pay for the materials 
and production costs for the equipment.

Each UpSki uses 148ft (45 metres) of fabric, 449ft (137 metres) of cord and is created using 40 hours of man power.

The
 company said it has spent ‘countless hours over many years’ testing us 
design in the harsh conditions and climbing large peaks.

It is sewed and assembled in Colorado and the fabric comes from mills based in the U.S.
