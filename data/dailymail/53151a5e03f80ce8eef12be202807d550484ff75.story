An incredibly rare rainbow was pictured in clear blue sky above South Yorkshire this morning - with not a cloud in sight.

The natural wonder, which usually appears when only when there is rain, was spied at Renishaw Hall near Sheffield.

Blue skies surrounded the hall and gardens and there wasn't a hint of rain.

Rainbows are normally seen whenever there are water drops in the air and sunlight shining from behind at a low altitude angle.

They span a continuous spectrum of colours, although they appear in bands to the human eye.

Seven colours - red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet - are thought to be representative of how humans with normal vision see rainbows.

A spokeswoman from the Met office 
said: 'Strong winds can blow rain drops from clouds from miles away - 
all it needs is moisture in the air to refract the sunlight.'

Jane Travis who works at the seventeenth century stately home said: 'I've never seen anything like this - it was incredible.'

The phenomenon happened after it was 
revealed November was the second-warmest since records began, and snow 
finally fell in England.

The first flurry of winter came as the Met Office warned that temperatures are set to plunge.

Let it snow: In the South Tyne Valley, people had their first taste of winter as the first flakes blanket the ground

Brrr: Blizzards greeted those who ventured outdoors this morning as snow swept across the countryside

It briefly fell 
across the South Tyne Valley in Cumbria in the morning as temperatures 
in the region dipped below freezing. Kath Renwick, manager at the 
Hartside Top cafe in Alston, said: ‘We were all really excited, it’s the
 first time we’ve seen it this winter. 

‘We normally get a lot of snow around here so it doesn’t surprise me that we’re the first.’  

Earlier,
 forecasters warned that temperatures would drop towards freezing in the
 coming days. And despite the unseasonably warm weather of the last 
three months – autumn 2011 was the second-warmest on record – this month
 is unlikely to throw up any surprises.

In fact, the Met Office expects temperatures to slip back to the norm for this time of year.

Forecaster George Goodfellow said today: "There will probably be snow on higher ground in the far reaches of Scotland and perhaps down to Dumfries and Galloway in the south west.

'We're looking at up to 15cm at around 400m above sea level, to maybe 5cm to 10cm at 200m and 5cm at 100m.'

He added that the tops of mountains in Snowdonia, in north Wales, and the Pennines in Cumbria might see a gentle dusting but snow is unlikely on lower ground.

Forecaster Dan Williams warned yesterday: ‘Winter has finally arrived. It’s going to be quite changeable throughout the coming month, with bursts of cold and mild weather. Temperatures across the UK are largely going to be below the average in the coming days. We’ve got some colder weather coming, particularly for the back end of the weekend.'

Warning: The Met Office has issued a severe 
weather warning (marked in yellow) for northernScotland warning residents to brace 
themselves for snow on Sunday and Monday

Saturday: Unsettled

Sunday: Snow in Scotland

Monday: Snow and showers

By Sunday, temperatures in the East could be as low as 0c (32f).

In London, they could drop to 2c (35.6f), with just a 6c (42.8f) maximum. ‘The temperatures for December are going to be close to the UK average for this time of year,’ added Mr Williams. ‘It’s going to feel particularly cold because of the mild autumn we’ve enjoyed.’

He said it was too early to predict snowfall in the coming weeks, but would not rule it out.

Today it was revealed councils have stockpiled more road salt than was used through all of last winter.

Town halls in England and Wales have about 1.4 million tonnes of salt to hand, the Local Government Association said.

A total of 51 per cent of councils have more salt for the start of this winter than they had for the start of winter 2010/11, with 48% aiming to have the same amount.

On average, each council has about 4,900 tonnes of salt in stock - about 1,500 tonnes more than this time last year.

Last winter councils each spread, on average 4,000 tonnes of salt, which was about three-quarters of their total stocked throughout the season.

Nearly a third of 
councils have invested in new gritters and 99% of councils will be 
updating their websites regularly about the state of gritting.

The LGA said 
councils across England and Wales had invested in new fleets of 
GPS-tracked gritting trucks, snow ploughs and specialist vehicles for 
narrow and hilly streets. Some are also using new types of salt and 
methods of spreading it to make supplies last longer.

Thousands of new 
grit bins have been placed in estates and side streets, residents have 
been given their own bags of salt along with salt spreaders in some 
neighbourhoods, and arrangements have been made with parish councils, 
farmers and community groups to grit hard-to-reach areas.

Councillor Peter 
Box, chairman of the LGA's economy and transport board, said: 'Councils 
have got more salt this year along with better plans to use it and new 
technology to make it go further.

'We're well prepared to keep roads safe and traffic moving, whatever the weather throws at us.'

This autumn's 11.2c (52.16f) average mean temperature has been beaten only beaten by the 11.39c (52.5f) set in 2006.

And this year remains on course to be the 11th warmest globally.
