He gained 10 Test caps and helped England's sevens team win a silver medal at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne.

Sale rugby director Steve Diamond said: "I am delighted Magnus has signed for us.

'I gave him his debut back in 2002 and have followed his career down the years. He is a great signing for us and will fit in perfectly with our plans.'
