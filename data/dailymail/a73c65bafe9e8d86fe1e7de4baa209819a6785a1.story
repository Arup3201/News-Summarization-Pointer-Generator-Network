A lucky dog has been saved after firefighters found her unconscious in a burning building.

Stella, a female boxer, was found behind a mattress in her home in Santa Monica, California when firefighters searched the structure for any trapped victims.

'If you walked in there and looked at it 
the first time through you wouldn't see it,' Captain Jeff Furrows of the
 Santa Monica Fire Department told KTLA.
