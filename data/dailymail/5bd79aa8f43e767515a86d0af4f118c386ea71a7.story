Government plans to overhaul legal aid threaten to destroy Britain's 'world renowned' system of fair justice, a former judge warned today.

Sir Anthony Hooper, who retired as a Court 
of Appeal judge last year, hit out at Ministry of Justice 
reforms to cut £220million from the legal aid budget.

Under the proposals, organisations would
 compete for contracts by offering the lowest price, with companies like
 logistics group the Stobart Group among those bidding.

But Sir Anthony said this would deny defendants the long-held right to choose their solicitor and instead create a system where the quality of representation on offer would be vastly reduced.

Chairman of the Bar Council, Maura McGowan (left), and retired judge Sir Anthony Hooper (right) have criticised plans to cut £220million from the legal aid system

Speaking on BBC4's Today Programme, Sir Anthony said: 'At the moment, solicitors compete on quality.

'In the new system, there will be no competition on quality because they will be randomly allocated.

‘The government says it is 
replacing competition with something called Robust Quality Assurance –
 which, quite frankly, just sounds like gobbledygook.’

In the case of people with disabilities, this 
may result in a lawyer who doesn't have the right expertise for their 
particular needs being selected, he told the BBC.

Sir Anthony claimed the new system would see who firms of specialist law firms, such as those who help war veterans and the mentally ill, will simply 'disappear off the map'.

He told the Law Society Gazette: ‘These proposals by the inaptly named justice secretary are fundamentally flawed and must be rejected in whole.’

He was speaking after the Bar Council, which represents barristers in England and Wales, has published its response to the reforms.

The 150-page response said 
price competitive tendering (PCT) promotes the 'lowest possible quality 
of service' and will result in further changes to civil legal aid, 
hitting society's most vulnerable people.

Other changes will see criminal 
defendants living in households with a disposable income of £37,500 or 
more stopped from automatically accessing legal aid, while prisoners' 
rights to the support will also would be curbed.

Maura McGowan QC, chairman of the Bar 
Council, said: 'There is no avoiding the simple fact that these 
proposals would move us from having a justice system which is admired 
all over the world, to a system where price trumps all.

'PCT
 may look as though it achieves short-term savings, but it is a blunt 
instrument that will leave deep scars on our justice system for far 
longer.

'Further cuts to the scope of 
civil legal aid will limit access to justice for some of the most 
vulnerable. That is a legacy of which no Government should be proud.'

She added: 'The proposals simply do 
not have a sufficient evidence base on which to attract support. We 
believe that if these proposals are implemented as they stand, the 
system will go very badly wrong. Once implemented, these measures cannot
 be easily reversed.'

Ms 
McGowan QC said Justice Secretary Chris Grayling should achieve any 
required reforms 'without destroying a world-renowned institution'.

The Bar Council response said that the
 proposals would destroy the livelihoods of many smaller solicitors' 
firms and the criminal defence Bar.

Standing firm: Justice secretary Chris Grayling says the legal sector cannot be immune from government cuts and costs paid to lawyer should 'reflect this'

Criminal legal aid costs taxpayers more than £1 billion every year and the proposals should cut the bill by £220 million.

In April, reforms to the Legal Aid, 
Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act (Laspo) came into effect, 
removing large areas of law from the scope of civil legal aid.

Some
 law firms estimated the reforms will reduce the number of people who 
qualify for legal aid by 75 per cent, meaning around 200,000 fewer 
cases, while barristers warned the cuts are the biggest to civil legal 
aid since the system was introduced in 1949.

In its response to the consultation, the Bar Standards Board (BSB), the body responsible for regulating barristers, said plans to pay legal aid lawyers the same amount for a 'guilty' or 'not guilty' plea could lead to defendants being pressurised into pleading guilty.

It said cases where the defendant enters an initial guilty plea are typically shorter and so cheaper than trials to assess guilt.

Setting the same fee for cases where a defendant pleads guilty and for longer trials may create an incentive for lawyers to encourage clients to plead guilty.

Bar Standards Board chair Baroness Ruth Deech said: 'These reforms may endanger the ability of our legal system to guarantee everyone a fair trial.

'While we accept that the current austerity measures are a consequence of the financial climate, protecting the public, and ensuring criminal cases are dealt with fairly and justly, remain of the utmost importance.'

Mr Grayling said: 'We have one of the best legal professions in the world.

'But at a time of major financial challenges, the legal sector cannot be excluded from the Government's commitment to getting better value for taxpayers' money. We believe costs paid to lawyers through legal aid should reflect this.

'Professional, qualified lawyers will be available, just as they are now, and contracts will only be awarded to lawyers who meet quality standards set by the profession.

'Wealthy defendants who can afford to pay for their own legal bills should do so. Our proposal is to introduce a threshold on Crown Court legal aid so that people earning around £100,000 a year are no longer automatically granted legal aid.

'We have one of the most expensive legal aid systems in the world, with about £1 billion a year spent just on criminal legal aid.

'These changes are about getting the best value for the taxpayer and will not in any way affect someone's right to a fair trial.'
