A Korean girl group has sparked outrage for wearing armbands strikingly similar to those worn by the Nazis during the Second World War.

During a recent performance, the pop group pulled off their coats to reveal completely black outfits with short frilly dresses - and bright red armbands featuring a black cross on a white circle.

The managers of rookie girl group Pritz - which stands for 'Pretty Rangers in Terrible Zone' - have denied the similarities were deliberate, but the group has come under fire for the obvious resemblance.

Pictures of the armbands were quickly shared on social media, where users agreed that they looked almost identical to the armbands used by the Nazis.

Pritz's entertainment agency Pandagram, which rejected the comparison, said that when they were designing the costumes the 'thought never occurred' to them that the armbands and black outfits could be reminiscent of Nazi uniforms.

According to Pandagram, the logo was inspired by traffic signs, with black numbers written on white circles surrounded by red.

The X-shape has arrowheads at the end to symbolise Pritz's ambitions of expanding 'without a limit in four directions,' according to the company's representative.

The girl group from the South Korean capital Seoul wore the armband outfits on November 2, but had sung the same song at an event on October 25 without them.

One social media user pointed out that Pritz's insignia more closely resembled that of Hungary's defunct Arrow Cross Party, a political group active in the 1930s and 1940s, with a fascist, ultra-nationalist, and militantly anti-Semitic philosophy.

But whether Hungarian or German Nazis, most agreed it was a PR stunt that had gone badly wrong.

Pritz debuted in April 2014 with an anime-themed song, 'Go Girls!' The group is modelled after Japanese idol groups and has four members, Hana, Yuna, Ari, and Shua, all aged between 18 and 23-years-old.
