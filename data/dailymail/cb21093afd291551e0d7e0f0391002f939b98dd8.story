An interest rate rise will hit workers long before most see their pay increase, the Bank of England governor warned yesterday.

Mark Carney said a rise was ‘getting closer’, indicating it is likely to take place next spring in line with predictions.

For workers going through the biggest squeeze on pay since the 1920s, this will mean facing the threat of higher mortgage payments before benefiting from a higher salary. The combination will put impossible pressure on millions of families. 

Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney said 'the Great Recession' had been a 'calamity' for workers

Mr Carney admitted: ‘We are under no illusions. The Great Recession was a calamity. Britain’s workers have borne many of the consequences.’ But he added: ‘The point at which interest rates also begin to normalise is getting closer . . . You can expect interest rates to begin to rise.’

Economists expect interest rates, frozen at a record low of 0.5 per cent since March 2009, will be ‘beginning to increase by the spring and thereafter rising very gradually’, he said.

It raises the explosive prospect of the first rise for seven years hitting homeowners weeks before the general election in May.

Mr Carney said the pay squeeze will go on for several more years, adding that a typical worker’s wages, adjusted for the cost of living, have fallen by a tenth since the start of the crisis. Speaking at the Trades Union Congress in Liverpool, he said: ‘To find such a fall in the past, you would have to go back to the early 1920s.’

Pay rises are still ‘very weak’, he said, 0.6 per cent on average, and are set to show only ‘a modest pick up over coming quarters’.

It will take until 2017 for pay rises to reach 4 per cent, he said, but they should exceed inflation ‘around the middle of next year’.

Mr Carney said Britons ‘deserve’ a pay rise after a six-year squeeze. He repeated the Bank’s mantra that interest rate rises will be ‘gradual and limited’.

Since the Bank was founded in 1694, the average level of interest rates has been 5 per cent. Mr Carney said they will not hit this level in the next few years.

He rubbished the idea that the Tories had asked him not to raise rates on the eve of an election.

Frances O'Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, told the annual conference in Liverpool that Britain needed a pay rise

The Bank is ‘absolutely indifferent to the political cycle, to who is in government, who might be in government, who was in government’, he insisted.

Mr Carney said unemployment, currently more than two million, will continue to fall. While other countries, such as the US, face ‘a clear danger of a misplaced, if not lost, generation of workers’, he said Britain’s labour market was impressively resilient.

The unemployment rate, now 6.4 per cent, will fall to 5.5 per cent ‘over the next three years’ with 1.2million new jobs, he said.

Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the TUC, said Mr Carney ‘recognised the pain felt by British workers’. Len McCluskey, leader of the Unite union, said the speech gave a ‘somewhat depressing’ message that people are working longer for less pay.

Howard Archer, of consultancy IHS Global Insight, said the speech ‘seems to support the view that a very gradual increase in interest rates is likely to get under way in February or soon afterwards’.
