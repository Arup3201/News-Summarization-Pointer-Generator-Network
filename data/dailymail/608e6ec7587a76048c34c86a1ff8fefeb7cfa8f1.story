When you look at the players in midfield at Manchester United and Chelsea, it’s hard to see anyone from United making it into Jose Mourinho’s side. They will think that’s a slur but unfortunately for them it’s a fact.

Michael Carrick is a very good player and would have made it, but Nemanja Matic makes that tough for him now. Adnan Januzaj could become world class, but you still wouldn’t pick him ahead of Eden Hazard at the moment.

United are not short of good players, they’re short of great players. They won the league at a canter last season, so this is not a bad squad, but every other side improved over the summer and United got left behind.

Superstar: Eden Hazard has been in blistering form for Chelsea in the past few weeks

The return: Nemanja Matic trains for the first time since coming back to Chelsea, and tops Michael Carrick

United they stand: But would Michael Carrick (left) and Adnan Januzaj get a game at Chelsea?

Splashing out: Chelsea have spent a staggering £229.9m since summer 2010

They are missing that stardust and, particularly when Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie do not play, they are missing match-winners. 

Januzaj has been sensational and one of David Moyes’s most productive players, but, him apart, United lack creativity in the middle.

Chelsea’s midfielders have scored 26 Premier League goals this season while United’s have scored just seven.

Only Januzaj and Antonio Valencia have any assists (two each) and the entire United midfield has made just 96 chances.

Between them, Eden Hazard, Oscar, 
Willian and Juan Mata have created 122 chances and across the squad, 
eight Chelsea midfielders have assisted goals.

It’s that kind of creativity United are crying out for.

It’s
 a shame for Marouane Fellaini that he’s injured, because with Rooney 
out, Moyes could have used him further forward as another option.

Even 
so, I’m still not sure he is a United player.

Towards
 the end of my career, when I lined up in the tunnel against them, you 
would look across and see Cristiano Ronaldo, Paul Scholes and Ryan 
Giggs.

They were the game-changers but it’s hard to see that in the 
current United midfield.

Playmaker: Brazil star Oscar has emerged as one of the best midfielders in the Premier League

Hair apparent: Willian (left) has staked his claim for a place in the Chelsea starting Xi in recent weeks

Creative force? Japan star Shinji Kagawa can barely get a game in United's midfield

Big-money move: But is Marouane Fellaini really a top-quality United player?

Instead, it’s Chelsea who have the exceptional talents. Hazard is the form man, but anyone in football won’t be surprised by his progress. Joe Cole said he was the best player he’d played with while he was on loan at Lille and now, with extra experience, he is performing out of his skin.

Willian has really impressed me, too, and is a lot tougher than I thought he would be. We all know how good Oscar is.

Then you look at the rest of Chelsea’s midfielders and the strength in depth is obvious. Any club that can afford to leave Mata on the bench is a contender for the title. And Mata is exactly the kind of player Moyes would love.

Making his point: Jose Mourinho will finally have to concede his team are serious title contenders

Under-fire: David Moyes wants to be able to call upon the kind of star quality that Chelsea can

Strength in depth: The Blues can afford to leave quality like Andre Schurrle and Juan Mata on the bench

The re-signing of Matic will only improve Chelsea. He’s a real thoroughbred and will protect that back four. In any other business it would be madness to let go of an asset and then buy it back for a much greater price, but football plays by different rules and the best players come at a cost.

Mourinho is the master of playing the underdog, but I hope he finally admits his squad are now capable of challenging. He talks about how much firepower Manchester City have, and they do, but if you look at the money Chelsea have spent, they are no paupers.

I hate to say ‘transition’ — it’s an overused word — but that’s where United are. It will take time and money to rebuild the midfield and the rest of the squad, but it is something they need to address quickly.

While Manchester United continue to crave for the players to fill the boots of Roy Keane and Paul Scholes, rivals Chelsea have been busy snapping up the game's best midfielders.

Indeed, since 2010 the Blues have splashed a staggering £229.9million strengthening their midfield options, this in comparison to United's £98m.

It is the area of the park open to most fierce criticism at Old Trafford and, say many observers, the reason behind their decline.

Bring it on home: Nemanja Matic re-joined Chelsea this month after a spell at Benfica

Samba star: Ramires signed for Chelsea in 2010

New kid on the block: Bertrand Traore is one of two midfielders Chelsea have signed this transfer window

When United and Chelsea meet at 
Stamford Bridge on Sunday, the disparity between the two engine-rooms 
will be highlighted still further as the hosts unveil £21m new boy 
Nemanja Matic, the midfield general they re-signed from Benfica this 
week.

What would David Moyes do for such a 
signing? The Red Devils boss has been trawling the continent this past 
fortnight in a bid to unearth the man to remedy his midfield woe.

The Scot has been forced to field 
40-year-old Ryan Giggs at the heart of his team this season, as well as 
on occasion defender Phil Jones.

That they have been selected ahead of
 Marouane Fellaini – Moyes' sole midfield acquisition – speaks volumes 
for the faltering form of the £28m deadline-day purchase.

New boy: Marco van Ginkel's debut season at Stamford Bridge has been blighted by injury

Moyes will again be reliant on teenager Adnan Januzaj for midfield inspiration this weekend.
Jose Mourinho, in comparison, will boast an embarrassment of riches.

Since the summer of 2012 alone, Chelsea have now spent upwards of £15m on five midfield players.

Eden Hazard was a £32m arrival from 
Lille, Oscar a £25m recruit from Internacional, Leverkusen's Andre 
Schurrle cost £18m, Willian was a £32m steal from under the noses of 
Spurs and now Matic.

Short stay: Yossi Benayoun made a £5.5million switch from Liverpool to Stamford Bridge

Marquee signing: Andre Schurrle holds his Chelsea shirt up at the Cobham training base

Rising star: A fresh-faced Oscar proudly holds up his home shirt at the Cobham HQ

In that same period United have 
signed four midfielders; Shinji Kagawa, a player who has struggled to 
impact, Nick Powell, currently on loan at Wigan, Wilfried Zaha, an 
outcast under Moyes, and, of course, the disappointing Fellaini.

But perhaps most galling of all for 
Moyes and followers of United will be the sight of £23m Juan Mata 
warming the bench; how they would long for the Spaniard to fill the 
playmaker role once populated by Scholes.

Mega money: Willian joined from Anzhi for a whopping £32million last summer

Then there is John Mikel Obi, 
Chelsea's in-form anchorman who was all set for a move to United in 2005
 before the west Londoners intervened and prised him from their grasp.

It all leaves Moyes casting envious eyes towards Mourinho and his midfield men.

The United chief will seek to strengthen this month but that will not come in time for Sunday's battle at the Bridge.

If that game is won or lost in the middle of the park, then there will surely be just one victor.
