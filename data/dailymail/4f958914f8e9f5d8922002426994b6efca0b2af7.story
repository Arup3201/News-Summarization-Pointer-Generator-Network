As the daughter of Greg Scarpa, a notorious mobster, Linda Schiro has lived constantly racked with guilt about the brutal beatings and murders that her father carried out.

The 42-year-old, who is writing a memoir about growing up with one of the most renowned men in the New York crime underworld, recalls how her father could kill someone and then watch TV with her 'five minutes later'.

Scarpa, who was known to peers as The Grim Reaper, was an integral part of the Colombo mob war - boasting that he gave up counting his murder victims after killing 50 people.

In an interview with the New York Post, Schiro describes her upbringing as ‘like growing up with a serial killer.’

Remembering her painful childhood, Schiro, who was known as Little Linda while her mother was dubbed Big Linda, told the paper: 'He could transform himself.

He could go kill someone and five minutes later he’d be home watching Wheel of Fortune with my brother and me.'

And Schiro reveals how her gangster father would take savage revenge on anyone who interfered with her, including one a boy who dared kiss her on her doorstep.

A particularly haunting memory dates back to 1983, when 14-year-old 'Little Linda' was assaulted by Jose Guzman, a driver who was taking her to school.

Guzman pulled over the car before tearing the buttons off the schoolgirl’s shirt and licking her hand.

Thinking quickly, she avoided further abuse by telling her attacker she would meet him after school instead.

She called her mother from the school in floods of tears. Of course, Big Linda told Scarpa who found out where Guzman lived and marched to his home – armed with a cane.

After charming Guzman into walking with him to the park, Scarpa’s gang pounced and carried out a violent attack that left the driver with a broken nose, wrist and ribs.

Scarpa himself beat Guzman so viciously that he broke his cane. Weeks later Guzman was gunned down in broad daylight by Scarpa’s oldest son, Greg Jr. No one was charged with the killing.

Schiro remembers her father telling her that she didn’t have to worry about that guy anymore.

The so-far innocent teen found out what her father meant when she later overheard the gang, gathered in her living room, discuss how Guzman tried to run for his life before being shot in the head.

But friends of the girl who committed far less serious transgressions were also attacked by The Grim Reaper.

A 14-year-old boy, whom Schiro described as her ‘best friend’, had his face beaten in after he smoked marijuana with the mob boss's daughter.

‘How he survived, I don’t know — it was a massive beating,' Schiro recalls to the Post.

'Greg said, "See, this is what happens when you give my daughter drugs!" '

Scarpa called himself ‘The Killing Machine’ – even signing letters to his family ‘KM’  but Schiro also remembers him as a ‘loving father.’

'My father was a different type of gangster. He let us know what was going on — street business, if they need to hit someone. It made me fear telling him things. But I was so much of a daddy’s girl. And he was extremely loving and caring towards us. He was my best friend,' she told the Post.

However, describing him as a ‘family man’ would be fanciful as Schiro believes that among his victims was Scarpa's own brother, her uncle Sal.

Another victim of the gang life was Scarpa’s son, Joey, who was shot in the eye during one fight before being shot dead less than a year later in the early nineties.

Schiro also recounts discovering her father's big secret - that he was also working for the FBI.

After confessing that FBI agent Lindley DeVecchio was his boss, Scarpa instructed his daughter not to mention the cop's name outside their house.

She said: 'He used to tell us he was James Bond. So I asked, ‘What do you mean, you’re an agent?’ He loved those movies. He’d say, ‘I’m Bond, Greg Bond.'

Scarpa himself was arrested in 1992 for murder and racketeering, and died just two years later from Aids.

But despite the wealth he enjoyed while he was alive, his millions vanished after his death, leaving his family with nothing.

Until recently, Schiro supported her mother and three young children by working as a liquor and beer-sales rep.

She described writing the book as ‘very hard’ emphasising that she did not want to ‘hurt people [or] glorify this life.’ ‘This life destroyed my family,’ she added.

Linda eventually got married, at age 21, to a banker from Long Island. Scarpa initially supported the marriage, but came to believe the husband was a threat.

She said: 'He said, ‘I want to kill him, but I need your permission. I don’t want you to live with the guilt.''I said, ‘You can’t do that!’ But ultimately, he was right. My husband tormented me.'
