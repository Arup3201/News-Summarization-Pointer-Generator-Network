A Denver women claims she was sexually assaulted by TSA
agents during repeated security pat downs – on a day she wasn’t even flying.

Jamelyn Steenhoek, 39,
says she was violated by TSA screeners while dropping her 13-year-old
daughter at the gate for her Dec 26 flight – the subsequent friskings from TSA
agents felt like a medical exam, she said.

The Denver Police
Department is now investigating her claims after she filed a police report,
according to CBS Denver.

Claims of sex assault: Jamelyn Steenhoef claims frisky TSA agents sexually assaulted her during security searches as thorough as a medical exam

‘We take all complaints seriously
and we are on this case,’ a police spokesperson told the station. ‘We have
launched an investigation into it.’

Ms Steenhoek said in an
interview with the station that she was escorting her daughter to the
Philadelphia-bound flight’s gate when TSA inspectors were alerted by an alarm
going off at the security checkpoint.

She says the said her
jeans must have been at fault, they had studs on the back pockets, an agent then conducted
an explosives swab on her hands.

‘Then they told me I
tested positive for explosives,’ she recalled, saying that she told
screeners she pumped gas earlier that day and it must have triggered the
positive result.

She said, ‘We’ll have to
do a search.’ So I thought, ‘Okay,’ said Ms Steenhoek.

It was the jeans: Ms Steenhoef says studs on the back of her jeans set of an airport medical detector

It came back positive: The woman then says an explosives swab similar to this one tested positive - this is where she says the trouble began

They took her aside and
frisked her out in the open like they do any other person singled out for a
more thorough search, but Ms Steenhoek says something felt off .

‘They told me to spread my
arms and spread my feet,’ she explained.

‘At that point she did a
pretty invasive search,’ Ms Steenhoek recalled. ‘They are just areas of the
body I’m not comfortable being touched in. On the outside of my pants she
cupped my crotch. I was uncomfortable with that.

‘The part of the search
that bothered most was the breast search. You could tell it shouldn’t take that
much groping. To me it was as extensive as an exam from my physician — full
touching and grabbing in the front. I felt uncomfortable, I felt violated.’

The agent found nothing –
so they took her to a second room and did the search again.

‘The whole search was done
over and more touching and grabbing than the first time,’ said the distraught
woman.

Too invasive: Ms Steenhoef says the initial exam was too touchy-feely, but the next exam was even worse

Private exam: The woman was then taken to one of these rooms for what she said was a much more rigorous exam similar to a medical exam

Ms Steenhoek’s teen
daughter stood idly by while her mother was searched and then searched again
before the TSA finally let her go.

Agents never found any
prohibited items.

Her daughter made her
flight, and Ms Steenhoek filed a complaint three days later claiming sexual
assault.

‘I was looking for
consequences, for TSA to be accountable for what they do to people,’ she
said.

A TSA spokesperson said in
a statement that ‘officers are trained to perform each pat down in a
professional manner to ensure that all individuals are screened to the same
standards.’

The agency ‘is confident
the facts will support our officer’s adherence to proper pat-down procedures.’

Authorities are still
investigating Ms Steenhoek’s claims.
