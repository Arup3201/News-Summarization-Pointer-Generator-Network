A gang who ram-raided a jewellery store to steal cash and jewels worth £100,000 have been jailed for more than 30 years.

Michael Faux, 28, Paul Frater, 28, Lee Sowe, 30, and Jamie Upton, 31, used a Land Rover to ram the back wall of a jewellery store in Ashton-Under-Lyne, Greater Manchester, so it collapsed.

Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court heard the gang stole vehicles fitted them with false number plates to use in the robbery a few days before the incident on October 4 last year.

Scene of the crime: The gang used a Lanr Roer to smash down the back wall of a jewellery store in Ashton-Under-Lyne, Greater Manchester before making off with £100,000

A VW Golf was taken from a house on Manchester Road in Heywood, a Land Rover from a house in Breightmet, Bolton, and an Audi A4 from Wigan.

The Land Rover was then used to repeatedly ram into the back of Rekha Jewellers on Penny Meadow in Ashton town centre as the family who run it were closing up, causing the back wall to collapse.

Thieves: Jamie Upton (left) pleaded guilty to two robberies, burglary and dangerous driving and was given ten years; Lee Sowe (right)was found guilty at trial of robbery and was sentenced to ten years

The men then burst into the shop to steal cash and jewellery, fleeing the scene in the stolen Golf and ramming three police cars.

The VW was then abandoned with the gang getting into the Audi which was driven to Wilshaw Lane, where Upton was caught as he tried to escape through Waterloo Park. Faux, Sowe and Frater were caught later.

Frater pleaded guilty to robbery and burglary and was sentenced to six years.

Upton pleaded guilty to two robberies, burglary and dangerous driving and was given ten years.

Sowe was found guilty at trial of robbery and was sentenced to ten years.

Detective Constable Matthew Donnelly said: 'These men are prominent members of a notorious organised crime group we had been tracking for some time.

'When you factor in the fact they rammed three police cars in a futile bid to escape, you can see just how little regard for the lives of other people these criminals have. They only care about one thing – money.'
