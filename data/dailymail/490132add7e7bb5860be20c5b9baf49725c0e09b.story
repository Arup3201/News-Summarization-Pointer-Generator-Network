Cruzeiro have agreed to sell defensive midfielder Lucas Silva to Real Madrid, the Brazilian champions confirmed on Thursday.

Spanish sports newspaper Marca had earlier claimed that Real have reached an agreement with Cruzeiro to sign the Brazilian starlet for a reported 15million euros (£11.5m).

The 21-year-old has been linked with a host of Premier League sides - including Arsenal - during the last few months.

He is considered to be one of Brazil's most promising young players and has represented his country at junior level.

'We have been in touch with Real Madrid since last year and we're now discussing a fee,' Cruzeiro's director of football Valdir Barbosa told ESPN radio. 'I think a deal should be complete by the start of next week.' 

The Cruzeiro defensive midfielder has reportedly agreed to join Los Blancos for a fee of £11.5m

Silva was released from training on Thursday to have a medical with the European champions.

His arrival could prompt the departure of Asier Illarramendi who is believed to be a target for Real's struggling La Liga rivals Athletic Bilbao.
