Ruby Rose has had a very busy weekend.

After announcing an 'engagement' to designer Phoebe Dahl on Saturday via social media, the model and DJ also celebrated her birthday and met the mother of her bride-to-be.

PDA obviously isn't a problem for Phoebe's mother Lucy, who is the daughter of the late legendary children's author Roald Dahl and Oscar-winning Patricia Neal.

Phoebe also counts supermodel Sophie Dahl as he cousin.

She photo bombed a shot of the newly engaged couple and her other daughter Chloe and girlfriend Nikki smooching for the camera during Ruby's birthday celebrations on Sunday.

Ruby accompanied the hilarious shot with: '"How I met your mother" ...Chloe Dahl and her baby Nikki.. My baby Phoebe Dahl and ermmmm.. her mom and friend photobomb.'

Clearly ecstatic over her new love and family, the photo taking continued.

The Australian captioned the happy snap: '@chloedahl @lucydahl4 @faircloth_clothing could I look happier for my US bday party with the amazing Dahl family and the honorary Dahls, myself, @boothnation and @deli_katevf.'

Ruby thanked social media followers on Monday for their well wishes, saying 'Thank you all very much for the best wishes. Living the dream. In a wonderful place. Life is always worth living. Stick out the tough times.'

Twenty-five-year-old Phoebe's label Faircloth is a charity minded brand, donating one school uniform to a girl in Nepal for every dress it sells.

Her mother Lucy is known for writing Wild Child, staring Emma Roberts and cousin Sophie Dahl was a prominent model in the 1990s and 2000s.

On Saturday the 27-year-old uploaded an image of two 'I Do' canvases on her Instagram page, writing alongside it: 'After asking her to be mine 3 times always to be rejected I swore I'd never ask again... then this morning at 6 am she broke into my house with flowers, coffee and a question... and I said.. go f**k yourself... just kidding I said... @faircloth_clothing'

Ruby followed up the picture of the bedroom artwork with an Angelina Jolie-style shot of her holding a vile of what looks like blood, between her black painted nails.

The dramatic image was captioned: 'Nothing quite says love like a vile of her blood.. it pumps through her heart keeping every fibre of her being alive on this magical earth.. I'm going to make it into a necklace. So she's always living in, on and around me. @faircloth_clothing.'

This is Ruby's second engagement.

The tattooed beauty, who has a penchant for models, was set to marry Australian model Catherine McNeil in 2010.
