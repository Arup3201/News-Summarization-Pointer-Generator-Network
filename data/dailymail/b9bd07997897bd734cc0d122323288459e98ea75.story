The architects who designed Beijing's Bird's Nest stadium and Bayern Munich's Allianz Arena are looking at ways to increase the capacity of Stamford Bridge towards 60,000.

According to the Architects' Journal, Herzog & de Meuron are working with Lifschutz Davidson Sandilands to potentially design a revamp of Chelsea's 41,837-seater stadium to satisfy demand for tickets at the Premier League leaders' home.

Chelsea, who have previously looked in to building a new stadium at Earls Court, White City and Battersea Power Station, announced in June they had commissioned a study into how Stamford Bridge can be expanded.

The stadium is surrounded by buildings and next to a railway line in the heart of the Fulham Broadway area and no viable expansion method has yet been found despite owner Roman Abramovich's best efforts since buying the club in 2003.

According to the Architects' Journal, Swiss-based Herzog & de Meuron could recommend decking be built over the railway line to the east and the north of the stadium and have launched consultation on the extent of the plans.

A statement released by Chelsea in June read: 'A study of the area from Fulham Broadway town centre to Stamford Bridge and beyond has been commissioned by Chelsea Football Club’s owner Roman Abramovich.

'This study will review the potential for improvements to publicly-owned areas along Fulham Road and the area around the football ground, including the possibility of decking over the railway lines to the east and north of the ground. This could create landscaped public walkways and cycleways, while also reducing pedestrian traffic on Fulham Road and nearby streets on match days.

'The study will also assess the feasibility of an expansion of the stadium within the existing historic site boundaries, potentially to enlarge its capacity, enhance its facilities and improve the movement of people and vehicles on match and non-matchdays.'

Neither Herzog & de Meuron and Chelsea FC were available for comment when approached by the Architects' Journal.
