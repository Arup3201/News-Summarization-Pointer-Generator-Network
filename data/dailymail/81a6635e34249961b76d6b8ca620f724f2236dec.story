A toddler died shortly before his third birthday after a throat infection spread with devastating consequences.

Ollie Hiscutt died after a streptococcal throat infection caused tissue damage behind his tonsil and soft palette. This spread and ruptured a major blood vessel in his throat, leading to catastrophic blood loss.

He was cremated on the day his family should have been celebrating his third birthday.

Ollie Hiscutt was initially sent home from hospital with antibiotics after developing a sore throat, but he was readmitted after his condition deteriorated

Ollie was initially treated with antibiotics at Wythenshawe Hospital after developing a sore throat and was allowed to go home.

His mother and father Julie and Dave believed that he was on the mend. But the youngster’s condition worsened and he was taken back to hospital.

His condition rapidly worsened and he died two days after he ruptured a blood vessel despite doctors' best efforts to save him.

His father Dave, an accountant based in Didsbury, Manchester, said he never expected to say goodbye to his son.

The 33-year-old said: 'He was ill with a sore throat and swollen glands so we took him to hospital.

'His throat went down and he came home, but then he got worse.

'He had had colds and ear infections before but no-one thought this would happen.

'Strep infections can bring about unexpected outcomes and are dangerous in young children when they become invasive.'

Ollie has now inspired a fundraising campaign for the hospital that cared for him.

His father said friends, family and Dave’s teammates from Wilmslow Ravens rugby club were taking part in a triathlon in May to raise money for the Starlight ward, the children’s unit where Ollie died.

Ollie was said to be the biggest fan of his father's rugby club and enjoyed going to matches with mother Julie to see his father play.

Dave, 33, said: 'The money is of course important, the hospital was fantastic and it will make a big difference. But it’s also been amazing seeing all those people remembering Ollie.

'The neighbours and lads at rugby have helped us through. Everyone loved Ollie and no-one can believe it.

'He was a completely normal boy and would tear about like any toddler, but also had a really caring side and that’s what I’ll remember.

'He had a smile for everyone and even in hospital he didn’t moan. He was really strong.'

Now the couple is concentrating on the birth of their new baby in the New Year.

Dave said: 'Ollie had a T-shirt saying ‘I’m going to be a big brother’ which helped us announce it to the grandparents.

'He loved babies and was really looking to have a little brother or sister.'

Dave says he and Julie have no regrets and take comfort that Ollie was as happy as he could be.

Julie said: 'Oliver was a truly happy boy with the most infectious smile.

'We knew he loved us and he knew we loved him. A day didn’t go by without us telling each other ‘love you all the world’.

'We know Ollie is in a happy and peaceful place and will make sure we remain happy and positive as it is all he would have wanted.'
