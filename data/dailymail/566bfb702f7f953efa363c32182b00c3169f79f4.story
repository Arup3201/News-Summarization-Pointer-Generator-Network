Juventus have made an £2million loan fee offer to Bayern Munich for winger Xherdan Shaqiri with view to a £10m permanent deal.

Liverpool and Inter Milan have also shown an interest in the Swiss 23-year-old.

Earlier this week, however, former Switzerland international Kubilay Turkyilmaz warned Shaqiri against moving to Anfield.

Juventus have made an £2million loan fee offer to Bayern Munich for winger Xherdan Shaqiri

The Switzerland international impressed while in Brazil at the World Cup in the summer 

He told Blick: 'England would suit Shaq more. They are less obsessed with tactics there, but a move to Liverpool right now could not be more unsuitable.

'They are in a crisis and cannot really have any ambitions this year. Joining them from Bayern, who expect to win titles every season, would be a culture shock.'

Turkyilmaz also did not speak too highly of the prospect of Shaqiri moving to Serie A.

He said: 'Not only because Serie A is the weakest of all the big leagues, but above all because they play so tactically there.

'When I look at the clubs who are interested in Xherdan, there are clear preferences for me and Juventus would be a disaster.

'Shaq needs freedom to express himself. Furthermore, with such a transfer, the expectations would be for him to make the difference immediately. Patience is in short supply in Italy.'
