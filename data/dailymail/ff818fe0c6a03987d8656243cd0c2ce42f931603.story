Yannick Bolasie showed off his trickery with a stunning '360 flick' during Crystal Palace's 0-0 draw against Tottenham Hotspur on Saturday.

And the Eagles winger also showed he has a sense of humour as he responded to accusations from BBC Match of the Day pundits that he did not know what he was doing.

To show it was no fluke, Bolasie  posted a video on his Instagram on Monday which featured footage of him doing it on two previous occasions.

Bolasie wrote on Instagram: 'I actually don't know what am doing.'

The trick was the highlight of a dull goalless draw at White Hart Lane - and Bolasie later revealed it was inspired by Brazilian legend Ronaldinho. 

Bolasie told the Mirror: 'I don’t do too many tricks like that on the pitch. It was a 360 and a flick.

'I did it a few times in the Championship but it was good to see it come off in the Premier League.

'I used to do it in the ­playground at school. When you don’t do tricks they become unfamiliar but because my confidence is high, I feel I can do anything.

'Before I was a professional I used to like Ronaldinho. There aren’t many players like that anymore and it is tough to carry on. It’s now all about stats. I’ve a couple more tricks in my locker. We will have to wait and see.'
