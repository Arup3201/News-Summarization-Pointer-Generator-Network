As Frank Lampard drifted into Leicester City's penalty area to tap in Samir Nasri's cross for his 175th Premier league goal, attention turned upon the former Chelsea man matching Thierry Henry's scoring tally.

But a Match of the Day graphic of the goal that decided the game at the King Power stadium on Saturday revealed how relegation threatened Leicester had 10 players in the penalty area, including goalkeeper Ben Hamer, who were unable to spot Lampard's presence as he settled the game from close range.

For City, it was a goal that continues their resurgence and leaves them only three points behind leaders Chelsea.

It was Lampard's 175th strike in the Premier League, moving his league scoring tally level with Thierry Henry

But for Leicester, it signifies the amount of work needed to be done if they are to overturn the five-point deficit between themselves and Burnley, in 17th. 

Next up for under-pressure Nigel Pearson and his side is a trip to Upton Park to face high-flyers West Ham.

A crunch-match follows against Hull, who are currently second last in the table but still have a three point cushion over newly-promoted Leicester.
