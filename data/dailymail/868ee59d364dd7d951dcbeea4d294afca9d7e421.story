A Californian shopping center is in lockdown as crisis negotiators try to persuade a gunman barricaded in a phone store to surrender.

The standoff began about 4pm Friday when the armed man ordered everyone out of a Connect Wireless store in Marketplace Shopping Center and threatened to kill himself.

The man ran into the outlet after allegedly robbing a pharmacy at the La Crescenta strip mall.

More
than eight hours after the standoff began, Los Angeles sheriff’s SWAT team members 
and deputies from multiple stations continue to surround the store as 
negotiators work to peacefully end the barricade.

The man's family is also on scene trying to convince him to give himself up.

Montrose-LaCrescenta Patch reports the man told police he was armed with a knife and two handguns. He did not take hostages.

Police fully evacuated the Foothill Boulevard mall by 7pm and closed surrounding roads.

KTLA 5 reports the man allegedly stole prescription drugs, reportedly OxyConton, from a Rite Aid Pharmacy in the shopping center.

Employees told NBC4 a man went into the pharmacy, demanded a prescription and showed a gun. When a worker gave the man the pills he demanded, he ran from the store.

Black Friday shoppers were reportedly confused as the incident unfolded because no-one told them what was going on, according to the LA Times.

The man's identity has not been released.

The Marketplace Shopping Center also houses a Ralphs, U.S. Bank and Starbucks.

Los Angeles Sheriff's Department is posting updates on its Twitter page.
