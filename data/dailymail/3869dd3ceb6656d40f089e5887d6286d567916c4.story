Polish schoolchildren are boosting English pupils' standards, a new study indicates.

Although many Polish children arriving in Britain do not speak English as their first language, they do not seem to hold back classmates in reading and writing.

And there is evidence they are actually helping to raise grades in subjects like mathematics.

'Welcome influence': Children of Eastern European immigrants appear to boost English pupils' performance in subjects like mathematics

The proportion of non-native pupils in primary schools in England has increased by a third to around 12% over the past 10 years - leading to fears they would take up too much of teachers' time.

But research by the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics shows they actually appear to have a positive effect on English children.

Prof Sandra McNally, who led the research, looked at data from 2005 to 2009 taken from the National Pupil database, a census of all children in English schools.

The professor of economics at Surrey University, said: 'Evidence from Catholic schools attended by the children of Polish immigrants suggests that the presence of non-native English speakers might – in some cases, at least – have a positive effect on natives’ results.'

High standards: Eastern European immigrants, like these children from Poland, may have benefited from better quality teaching in their homeland

Prof McNally said this could be due to better education standards in countries like Poland, as well as the work ethic of their parents, who had left their homeland to seek employment in Britain.

She said: 'It may be the fact that immigrants from East European countries are better educated and more attached to the labour market than the native population.

'The children of such immigrants may be a welcome influence in the schools they attend.'

There was an influx of Polish families in Britain after Poland joined the European Union in 2004.

Data analysed by Prof McNally and her research team showed a much larger increase in white non-native English speakers in state Catholic schools than other schools - more than doubling from two per cent to nearly 4.5 per cent between 2005 and 2009.

Prof McNally said it was possible Polish children caught up fast upon entering English schools.

She added: 'They may have other things about them in their own environment that make them good to have in your school.

'They might have very motivated parents, for example.'

Eastern European parents have complained that British schools are failing to challenge their children.

The concerns of parents from Poland and other Eastern European countries were recorded in a paper published by the Government’s Economic and Social Research Council.

Academics aimed to investigate discrimination suffered by foreign children but ended in recommending extra efforts by schools to ‘ensure that migrant children are challenged academically.’

The findings were based on detailed interviews with 57 children and families from Poland and the other seven countries which joined the EU eight years ago.

Since then, as many as a million and a half workers from the new EU countries are estimated to have arrived in Britain to work.
