Wanted: Police are looking for Julio Acevedo, 44, in connection with the deaths of an expectant couple

Police today identified a man suspected of driving the car that smashed into a taxi carrying a pregnant woman and her husband, killing them, before fleeing the scene.

Authorities are seeking Julio Acevedo, 44, who had a DWI arrest just two weeks ago and who has previously served eight years in prison for manslaughter, for the early-morning crash in Brooklyn on Sunday, police said.

The crash claimed the lives of Nachman and Raizi Glauber, both 21, and although their baby was delivered by emergency caesarean section following the crash, he also died on Monday.

The Glaubers were heading to hospital after Raizi, who was seven months pregnant, felt an unusual pain.

But
the newborn boy died early on Monday, a day after the crash claimed 
both of his parents, according to Isaac Abraham, a spokesman for the 
family's Orthodox Jewish community.

Acevedo was going at least 60 mph when the BMW he was allegedly driving slammed into the cab carrying the couple to a hospital, police said.

He has previously served eight years in prison on a manslaughter charge in a 
shooting death, and violated parole once after, according to a state 
department of correction spokeswoman.

As well as the 1987 shooting in Brooklyn, his record includes a 1997 robbery in the Bronx, according to DNAinfo.

When he was stopped by police last month for driving erratically, his blood alcohol level was far above the legal level at .13. He was charged with a DWI but released the next day without bail.

Tragic: Nathan and Raizy Glauber, both 21, were on the way to hospital when they were killed in a hit-and-run car crash. Their son, who was delivered by emergency C section, has also died

'We in the community are demanding that 
the prosecutor charge the driver of BMW that caused the death of this 
couple and infant ... with triple homicide,' Abraham said in a 
statement. 'This coward left the scene of the accident not even 
bothering to check on the people of the other car.'

A woman who identified herself at Acevedo's mother told the New York Daily News he would turn himself in on Monday.

Nachman and Raizi were traveling in the
black 2008 Toyota Camry livery cab to Long Island College Hospital in 
Cobble Hill when a BMW smashed into the car and fatally injured the 
would-be parents.

The Glaubers both were pronounced dead 
at hospitals, and the medical examiner said they died of blunt-force 
trauma. It's not clear if they were wearing seatbelts.

The cause of the crash remained under
investigation on Monday. The driver of the BMW was expected at least to
face charges of leaving the scene of an accident.

Deadly: Acevedo was allegedly driving this BMW when it smashed into the taxi carrying the Glaubers

Scene: Police still do not know the cause of the crash but believe Acevedo was travelling at 60 mph

A spokesman for the Orthodox Jewish community described the couple's death as 'a tragedy beyond (belief) just coming off a joyous holiday as Purim' as they were getting ready to welcome their first child

Police
initially believed the BMW driver had a passenger but now say he was 
alone in the vehicle. A witness said the BMW passed by at a high rate of
speed before the accident.

The
livery car, which the Glaubers had called as they did not have their 
own vehicle, was at a stop sign, but it was unclear if it had stopped, 
police said.

The taxi driver, Pedro Nunez Delacruz, 32, was not injured in the crash. He had an up-to-date license but an application to use the Toyota as a livery cab was still pending at the time of the crash.

This means it should not have been sent to collect them, according to the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission, but his union insisted he had done nothing wrong.

In New York City, yellow taxis are 
hailed on the street, but residents may call car services, and are 
picked up by drivers in everyday vehicles.

Meanwhile, police said the registered 
owner of the BMW, Takia Walker, 29 who was not in the car, was charged 
with insurance fraud on Sunday in a scam involving the car.

A person familiar with the investigation said Walker bought the car legally - or willingly used her identification for the purchase - then gave the car to another man. The middleman wasn't driving at the time of the accident, and had either lent or rented the car out to the driver, the person said.

The tragedy comes after Raizi Glauber's father spoke of his agony at her emotional funeral, which was attended by more than 1,000 orthodox Jewish mourners, on Sunday afternoon in New York.

'God is punishing me for my sins by taking away my daughter,' Yitzchak Silberstein said in Yiddish.

The impact from the t-bone smash sent
Raizi out into the street where her body came to rest under a trailer, 
while first responders had to cut the roof off the taxi to rescue 
Nachman and the taxi driver.

Both the Glaubers were pronounced dead at hospital. The
couple's child was born by C-Section at Bellevue Hospital in 
Manhattan, and had been in critical condition before his tragic passing.

Doctors had delivered the baby by cesarean section. Neighbors and friends said the boy weighed only about 4 pounds.

Ellen Borakove, spokeswoman for the 
city medical examiner's office, said the baby's death was caused by 
extreme prematurity due to maternal blunt force injuries.

Paramedic Yisroel Altman 
said he initially believed both husband and wife could survive, but 
their head injuries were just too much.

'I’ve
seen worse cases [car accidents], it was the knock on the head that 
killed them,' said Altman to the New York Post, adding that Raizi was 
responsive in the ambulance until a few minutes before she arrived at 
Bellevue.

Jewish law calls for the burial of 
the dead as soon as possible and at least 1,000 people gathered at Yetev
Lev D'Satmar synagogue in Brooklyn on Sunday to pay their respects to the 
Glaubers.

Tears: After the funeral began, a speaker sobbed uncontrollably, his voice choked with grief

Gathering: The services were in Brooklyn - home to the largest community of orthodox Jews outside Israel

A crowd of hasidic Jews gathered in front of the Brooklyn, New York, synagogue where funeral services were held Sunday

There will not be a similar funeral 
for the baby boy; Hasidim do not perform funerals for newborns who do 
not survive 30 days, according to Mendel Rosenberg, of Chesed Shel Emes.

At the funeral Rabbi Zalman Leib Teitelbaum, speaking in Yiddish, addressed the mourners.

'It's
a great tragedy for the community,' said Teitelbaum. 'We have to hold 
on together and see what we can do to make things better. This is a 
very, very big tragedy.'

Raizi's brother, Yitzchak Silberstein, spoke of his devastation at his sister's tragic passing to the New York Daily News.

'She was the crown of the family,' said Silberstein. 'We were sitting together last night and today she’s gone.'

The young Jewish Orthodox couple were on the way to the labor ward when the tragic incident occurred

He
was full of praise for his brother-in-law too. 'We can all learn from 
him how to treat a wife,' he said. 'The way he treated her was special.'

The funerals took place in Brooklyn, which is home to the largest 
community of ultra-orthodox Jews outside Israel, more than 250,000.

The 
community has strict rules governing clothing, social customs and 
interaction with the outside world. Men wear dark clothing that includes
a long coat and a fedora-type hat and often have long beards and ear 
locks.

Hundreds of members of the Satmar community gathered shoulder to 
shoulder on the street outside, men in hats and women in shawls or head 
coverings, nearly everyone in black.

The sound of wailing filled the 
street as the two black-draped coffins were carried from a vehicle.

After the funeral began, a speaker 
sobbed uncontrollably, his voice choked with grief and echoing over 
loudspeakers set up outside.

Just before, Nachman Glauber's cousin, Sara Glauber, said of her relative and his bride, 'if one had to go, the other had to go too because they really were one soul.'

Sara spoke admiringly of her cousin. 
'You don't meet anyone better than him,' she said. 'He was always doing 
favors for everyone.'

The Glaubers were married about a 
year ago and had begun a life together in Williamsburg, where Raizi 
Glauber grew up in a prominent Orthodox Jewish rabbinical family, Sara 
Glauber said.

Raised north of New York City in 
Monsey, N.Y., and part of a family that founded a line of clothing for 
Orthodox Jews, Nachman Glauber was studying at a rabbinical college 
nearby, said his cousin.
