Police have charged a Chicago driver in a drunken hit-and-run three weeks ago that sent two women plunging off a 50 foot bridge in their car to their deaths.

Officers found Lisa Elner, 44, stumbling drunk along a highway entrance near Lyons at around 7 a.m. on January 26 but she failed to tell them about the fatal crash she'd allegedly caused several hours earlier.

'She was freezing and allegedly intoxicated,' Commander Brian Kuratko said.

The crash killed Berwyn-woman Michelle Miranda, 37, and married mother-of-four Sandra Frankum, 36, of Bolingbrook after their SUV lost control on Harlem Avenue in Lyons, broke through a barrier and plummeted onto the road below - Canal Bank Drive in Summit.

Police said Elner was seriously injured in the crash and was taken to MacNeal Hospital in Berwyn for treatment.

According to the Chicago Tribune, the woman told the officers who came across her that she was walking home from a Berwyn bar.

On Friday, she surrendered to police and on Monday was charged with failure to report an accident involving death, aggravated driving under the influence involving death and cocaine possession as well as other driving offenses.
