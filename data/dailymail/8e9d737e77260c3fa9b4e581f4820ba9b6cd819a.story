Advanced health care systems mean a major Ebola epidemic in the West is unlikely according to the World Health Organisation.  

Dr Christopher Dye, WHO director of strategy said while the fact Ebola has spread to the West is a major concern it is unlikely to be a major problem. 

He said: 'The possibility that once an infection has been introduced that it spreads elsewhere, is something that everybody is going to be concerned about.'

Staff from the Centers for Disease Control are training healthcare workers in how to deal with Ebola safely

In Liberia, health workers routinely sterilise each other hafter handling the bodies of Ebola victims 

Speaking to BBC News, he said: 'We're confident that in North America and Western Europe where health systems are very strong, that we're unlikely to see a major outbreak in any of those places.'

According to Dr Tom Frieden of the Centers for Disease Control the chance of a major Ebola outbreak in the US is incredibly low, despite the latest confirmed cases of the disease in Texas.

He said: 'The United States has a strong health care system and dedicated public health professionals — all hard at work right now — to make sure this case will not threaten the community at large, or the nation. 

'A person who is sick from Ebola virus disease can be cared for in U.S. hospitals when the patient is isolated in a private room with a private bathroom and contact with them is highly controlled. Every health care worker must meticulously follow every single infection control protection we recommend.' 

Dr Thomas Frieden of the Centers for Disease Control tried to reassure Americans that they are not at risk 

US President Barack Obama said the chances of Americans contracting the virus was 'extremely low'. 

He has held meetings with the Centers for Disease Control at the White House to discuss the crisis and the correct response to any future Ebola cases. 

He said: 'First of all, what I’ve directed the CDC to do is that as soon as somebody is diagnosed with Ebola, we want a rapid response team, a SWAT team, essentially, from the CDC to be on the ground as quickly as possible -- hopefully within 24 hours -- so that they are taking the local hospital step by step through exactly what needs to be done and making sure that all the protocols are properly observed; that the use of protective equipment is done effectively; that disposal of that protective equipment is done properly.'

So far, Ebola has killed 4,500 people mostly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.
