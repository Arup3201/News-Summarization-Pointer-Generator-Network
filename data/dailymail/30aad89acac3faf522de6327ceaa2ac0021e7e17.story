The former wife of jailed sex offender Max Clifford has been pictured wearing what appears to be an engagement ring.

Divorcee Jo Westwood had married the now-disgraced PR man Clifford in 2010, but distanced herself from him when he was charged and then tried on a string of sex attacks.

Since Clifford, 71, was jailed last May, Mrs Westwood has reportedly been seen several times with her former husband, IT consultant Lee, with whom she has a daughter.

Engaged? In these photographs, taken  in the Cotswolds, Mrs Westwood is seen wearing what appears to be a sparkly band on her ring finger, sparking rumours that she and first husband Lee are engaged

Last year, the couple, who separated in 2003, were pictured enjoying time together in Broadway, Wiltshire, where the PR guru and his ex-wife had a £600,000 country residence.

And these latest photographs, taken of Mrs Westwood in the Cotswolds village today, suggest that the couple have taken the next step towards rekindling their marriage.

Dressed in a casual outfit and carrying a shopping bag, Mrs Westwood is seen getting into her car with what looks like a sparkly band on her ring finger.

The 51-year-old was a volunteer bereavement counsellor for a children’s hospice in Guildford, Surrey, which Clifford became a patron of.

He later admitted that he turned to her for support after the death of his first wife, Liz, from cancer in 2003.

He began courting her and she worked as his assistant at his London offices. They married after she proposed to him on a golf course in Marbella, Spain.

She was notably absent from his trial, however, which featured claims he abused girls as young as 12, and allegations that his extraordinary grooming technique involved telling impressionable young women that he had an extremely small penis.

On the very day he was convicted she was seen walking near their Cotswold cottage – without her wedding ring. 

Weeks later, a court granted her a divorce in just 105 seconds for his ‘unreasonable behaviour’, which has caused her stress and heart problems. 

In October it was reported that Mr Westwood had been seen driving the £150,000 Bentley coupe Clifford bought his ex-wife as a wedding present.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, she has splashed out on new personalised licence plates for the car, swapping the letters MAX for JO.

Engagement rumours first emerged last year when the Daily Star Sunday claimed Mrs Westwood had been seen visiting a jeweller’s with her ex-husband, and wearing a large ring.

A source told the newspaper at the time: ‘All Jo’s family and friends are really pleased that after everything she’s been through she is happy again.

‘None of them ever really liked Max. He was a bully and really put her through the mill.

‘She’s had a really tough couple of years with the allegations against Max but she’s put it all behind her. For the first time in ages she has a huge smile on her face.’
