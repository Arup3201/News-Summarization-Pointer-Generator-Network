Houston coach Gary Kubiak is alert and coherent but will remain in hospital for at least the next 24 hours after suffering 'stroke-like symptoms' on Sunday night.

Kubiak collapsed leaving the field at halftime of the Texans' game on Sunday night against Indianapolis. He was lifted off the field on a stretcher and taken by cart to an ambulance and then on to hospital.

‘Our primary concern is of course with Gary’s health and well-being,’ said Texans general manager Rick Smith on Monday.

Houston coach Gary Kubiak remains in hospital with 'stroke-like symptoms' after he collapsed leaving the field at halftime of the Texans' game on Sunday night against Indianapolis

‘There have been so many people 
throughout the city and across the country that have reached out to 
express their love and support and we are thankful for everyone’s 
thoughts and prayers.  Gary is alert, coherent and in good spirits. He 
is continuing to be evaluated and monitored.’

The team announced that Kubiak didn’t suffer a heart attack and, according to the Houston Chronicle, he did not suffer a stroke, but was being evaluated for ‘stroke-like symptoms.’

The team said the 52-year-old coach, a former NFL quarterback who calls the team's plays, was conscious and with his family as he was taken to the hospital.

‘He had an episode; he was light-headed and dizzy,’ Houston general manager Rick Smith said in an interview on NBC. ‘He was evaluated by a number of specialists... he is awake and coherent.’

The Texans lost the game 27-24 after leading 21-3 prior to Kubiak’s collapse. It was the team’s sixth straight loss after opening the season 2-0 with Super Bowl hopes.

'Obviously we were all upset about (it) but trying to stay focused at the same time,' quarterback Case Keenum said.

Defensive coordinator Wade Phillips took over for Kubiak in the second half and described the trying situation.

‘We had to adjust as far as the head coach not being there,’ Phillips said. ‘But, it was a shock to everybody.’

Kubiak has long been known as a top offensive coach, mentoring 
quarterbacks in Denver under Mike Shanahan and now Matt Schaub - and 
Case Keenum - in Houston. Kubiak has had no known public health 
problems.

Kubiak was hired in 2006, along with general manager Rick Smith, after 
the Texans finished a franchise-worst 2-14.

Smith spent 10 years with 
Kubiak while the coach was offensive coordinator of the Broncos. Smith 
was Denver's defensive assistant for four seasons before moving into the
front office for his last six years with the Broncos.

The pair has helped transform the Texans, which began play in 2002, from
league laughingstock to contenders. The team went 6-10 in their first 
year and 8-8 in each of the next two seasons.

Expectations were high in 
2010 after Houston finished at 9-7 for its first winning record in 2009.
But the Texans instead fell to 6-10, which led to many fans calling for
Kubiak's firing.

His original contract was due to expire after the 2010 season, but owner
Bob McNair has stepped up to keep Kubiak and defended him several times
amid the bumps.

Among recent departures were assistant head coach Alex 
Gibbs (for Seattle) and offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan went to join
his father, Mike, in Washington.

Kubiak hired former Denver offensive coordinator Rick Dennison to 
replace Shanahan and former Atlanta offensive coordinator Greg Knapp to 
become Houston's quarterbacks coach.

Dennison worked on the Broncos' 
staff during Kubiak's 11 years as Denver's offensive coordinator, and 
Knapp coached Schaub for three seasons with the Falcons.

The highest-profile assistant brought to Houston was Phillips, the 
veteran son of Bum Phillips and a former head coach in Dallas.

Last year, the Texans announced contract extensions for both Smith and 
Kubiak, rewarding them for taking the team to the playoffs last year for
the first time. Kubiak's three-year agreement has him under contract 
through 2014.

McNair said at the time he offered Kubiak a four-year deal, but the coach preferred to make it for three.

Kubiak made his mark as Denver's offensive coordinator under Shanahan, 
winning two Super Bowls. An eighth-round pick out of Texas A&M, he 
spent nine years as John Elway's backup. He finished his career 4-1 as a
starter, all in emergency relief of Elway.
