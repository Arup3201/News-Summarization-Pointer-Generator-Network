Blood appears as a bright stain on white ice as a family of polar bears tuck into dinner.

The striking pictures were taken on Ellesmere Island, Canada, as a mother polar bear and her two cubs feasted on what is believed to be a seal.

Justin Hofman, 31, was aboard the Lindblad Expeditions-National Geographic ship for a three week-voyage through the Canadian High Arctic.

The photographer Justin Hofman, 31, watched as the polar bears dined on their catch in the remote location on the ice pack

It was the experienced wildlife photographer's job to dive in remote locations, take pictures of the wildlife and share it among those on the ship.

He spotted Canadian geese, walrus and the white grizzly on his travels.

Justin, who is from California, watched as the polar bears dined on their catch, filling themselves up on the meat past the point of discomfort as food is scarce in the arctic.

The bears left a long trail of blood from the sea to the mound of ice where they gorged.

The mother had dragged her meal and hidden it to protect it from predators - as male polar bears can steal their kills or even eat their young.

He said: 'As the snowflakes began to fall, we watched as the bears slowly dined on their catch

'It was interesting to see just how messy the cubs were as opposed to the mother bear.

'Imagine a two-year old with a bowl of spaghetti. The cubs would occasionally walk away from the kill to clean ice and roll around as a way to get some of the blood and gore off of their fur.'

Justin was also lucky enough to witness the Northern Lights dance in the night sky over a clear stretch of Arctic ocean.

He added: 'After seeing these otherworldly lights in the sky, I can understand how ancient cultures without knowledge of science and the cosmos could develop the mythos that eventually became religion.'
