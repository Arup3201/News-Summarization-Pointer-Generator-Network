Oscar Pistorius will have to wait 
another day to discover if he will be granted bail as the hearing for 
the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp went into a fourth day.

Pistorius has admitted shooting 29-year-old model 
Miss Steenkamp, but claims he did so thinking she was a burglar or burglars, 
who were in the bathroom. He said he opened fire in the dark because he 
was too scared to turn a light on.

Realising his mistake, he broke the door down with a cricket bat and carried her downstairs, he said.

As the hearing got under way, Nike confirmed that it has suspended its contract with Pistorius.

Charged: Pistorius is alleged to have murdered Reeva Steenkamp

In
 a statement, the company said: 'We believe Oscar Pistorius should be 
afforded due process and we will continue to monitor the situation 
closely.'

The lead detective in the investigation has been dropped from the case after it emerged he is due to appear in court himself.

Detective
 Hilton Botha, who has given evidence against the Paralympian during his
 bail hearing this week, is facing seven counts of attempted murder and 
is due to appear in court in May.

He has been replaced on the case by  Lt. Gen. Vinesh Moonoo.

Botha
 and two other police officers are accused of firing shots while trying 
to stop a minibus in an incident believed to have happened in October 
2011.

'Blade Runner' Pistorius returned to court for the third day of his high-profile bail hearing.

Allegations: Hilton Botha is facing seven charges of attempted murder

In court, where Pistorius' father Henke and brother Carl were present again, prosecutor Gerrie Nel said they did not know about the charges faced by Botha yesterday.

Police Brigadier Neville Malila told Sky News that the charges only came to light late yesterday afternoon.

He said: 'We were only informed yesterday that attempted murders charges against Hilton Botha have been reinstated.

'The
 member is innocent until proven guilty. The member was chosen by the 
station to do the investigation due to the fact that he is a senior.'

The seven counts of attempted murder, dating back to 2011, relate to seven people in a minibus which was stopped and shot at, he said.

On Wednesday Botha acknowledged the prosecution had no evidence challenging Pistorius's claim that he killed his girlfriend accidentally, as well as admitting a number of police blunders in the investigation.

He said there was 'no way' he believed the double-amputee Paralympian's version of events, adding: 'I believe he knew she was in the bathroom and he shot four shots through the door.'

Medupe Simasiku, of the National Prosecution Agency, previously said prosecutors were unaware of the charges against Botha when they put him up in court to explain why Pistorius should not be given bail.

The court was told a witness heard 'non-stop shouting' coming from his home before he shot his girlfriend dead.

Tragedy: Reeva Steenkamp was shot dead last week

The witness overheard the 'row' which is said to have come from the property at the exclusive Silver Lakes Golf Estate between 2am and 3am on Valentine's Day, the prosecution said.

Shortly afterwards, Miss Steenkamp lay bleeding to death in Pistorius's bathroom.

She was hit by three bullets - one in the head, the hip and arm, Pretoria Magistrates' Court heard.

One witness reported hearing a shot, followed 17 minutes later by more shots, Botha said.

'One of our witnesses heard a fight, two people talking loudly at each other... from two in the morning to three,' he said, adding that the witness was about 1,000ft away.

The runner has said he shot through the door while on his stumps.

But the court heard the bullets' trajectory was through the top of the door and Botha claims the bullets were fired down, suggesting Pistorius was wearing his prosthetic legs when the shots were discharged.

The court also heard that two boxes of testosterone and needles were found in Pistorius's bedroom.

Allegations: Testosterone was reportedly found at Pistorius' home

His lawyer Barry Roux countered prosecution claims that testosterone was found, saying it was actually a herbal remedy, called Testocompasutium co-enzyme.

Details were also released yesterday of a row Pistorius had with a man over a girl at Kyalami racetrack where Pistorius allegedly threatened to 'f*** up' the rival.

It was also claimed he was involved in another shooting at a restaurant in Johannesburg in January and asked the gun owner to take responsibility for the accident.

In an affidavit, Pistorius said he and Miss Steenkamp were in love and he thought she was in bed in the early hours of last Thursday when he got up in the dark and blasted through the door.

Cross-examining Mr Botha, Mr Roux said a post-mortem examination showed Miss Steenkamp's bladder was empty, which he said is consistent with her getting up at 3am to go to the toilet.

Mr Roux asked repeatedly why the police did not make simple checks - over the lighting and whether Pistorius had other phones after police said two seized iPhones were not used to call police or paramedics.

Laughing stock: Botha was ridiculed in court for suggesting that Pistorius could jump bail

The lawyer said Pistorius phoned the housing complex manager for help at 3.19am, then Netcare hospital a minute later.

The police discarded anything that might have been consistent with a defence, said Mr Roux.

Officers found the victim covered in towels and wearing white shorts and a black top.

The prosecution believe Pistorius, who won two gold medals and a silver at London's 2012 Paralympic Games, is a flight risk and is opposing bail.

Pistorius, who had below-the-knee amputations when he was 11 months old, has offshore accounts and a property in Italy, it was claimed.

Outside the red-brick building the Women's League of the ruling African National Congress yesterday protested, waving placards saying 'No Bail for Pistorius' and 'Rot in jail'.

The case has stunned sports fans worldwide.

In custody: Pistorius is escorted at the Boschkop police holding cells last week

But it has been felt most acutely in South Africa, where Pistorius was seen as a hero who transcended racial divides that persist nearly 20 years after the end of apartheid.

He carried South Africa's flag at the closing ceremony of the London Olympics, and American magazine Sports Illustrated named him as one of the most inspiring figures of the year.

As well as Nike, the sprinter's endorsements and sponsorships included, telecoms firm BT, sunglasses maker Oakley and French designer Thierry Mugler and were thought to be worth as much as $2million (£1.3 million) a year.

Nike and Mugler both said they have dropped Pistorius from advertising campaigns, and the Clarins cosmetics giant said it was recalling its A Man perfume range out of 'respect and compassion towards the families involved'.

The prosecution said they were unaware of the charges against the detective when they put him on the stand in court to explain why Pistorius should not be given bail.

Brig Malila said that police learned yesterday, the same day that Botha appeared in court to oppose the bail application, that the charges against Botha and the two others had been reinstated by the Director of Public Prosecutions. They were initially dropped following the shooting incident.

He said police were waiting for details from the Botha case file from the prosecutor.

Medupe Simasiku, the spokesman for the prosecutors charging Pistorius with premeditated murder, could not say how the charges against Botha would affect their case against Pistorius.

'The (Pistorius) prosecutors were not aware of those charges (against Botha),' said Mr Simasiku, of the National Prosecution Agency.

'We are calling up the information so we can get the details of the case. From there we can take action and see if we remove him from the investigation or if he stays.'
