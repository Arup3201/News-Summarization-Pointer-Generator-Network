Firefighters in Missouri have rescued a parachutist who became tangled in the wires of a broadcast tower about 155 feet off the ground after he spent two hours dangling high above the ground. 

First responders were dispatched Thursday night after the man's parachute became snagged on the wires connected to the KETC-TV tower in south St. Louis County.  

A firefighter climbed the tower and passed an anchor to the hapless base jumper, later identified as 27-year-old Timothy Church, who released himself from his parachute and was lowered to the ground.

Authorities say the daredevil became stranded while attempting to perform a base jump from the broadcast tower belonging to the Nine Network of Public Media.

Timothy Church was spotted dangling from the tower in the 5400 block of Butler Hill Road at around 9.30pm.

The 27-year-old man was stuck about 155 feet in the air and hanging 20 feet from the tower, according to Mehlville Fire Protection District Chief Brian Hendricks.

The parachutist had a cellphone with him and was seen communicating with rescuers on the ground during the operation.

At around 11.45pm, a first responder ascended the tower laden with 30lbs of equipment and passed an anchor to the stranded Mr Church, who was then able to cut himself free from the parachute.

Free at last: The parachutist was able to cut himself from the harness, and he was then lowered to the ground 

The jumper was then slowly lowered to the ground, drawing applause from a small crowd of onlookers. He appeared in distress caused by suspension trauma, officials said, but was able to walk on his own to the ambulance.

‘For people to do things such as this and put our people in harm’s way, it is disturbing. It bothers us,’ Hendricks told KMOV.

Church has since been arrested and charged with trespassing on private property, along with 26-year-old Brandon Travis, who allegedly help the base jumper climb the tower.
