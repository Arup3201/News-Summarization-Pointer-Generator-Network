The 'deeply offensive' text messages which led to Kurtley Beale being indefinitely suspended by Australia can be revealed. 

Beale was suspended after arguing with the team's business manger Di Patston on a flight to South America last month and now the messages which sparked that bust-up have been leaked.

A letter sent to Beale by the Australian Rugby Union referenced two messages  containing photographs of 'extremely obese women', one with the message 'Di - who wants a go f***ing this?' The Sunday Telegraph reports.

It is alleged that the utility back wanted to send the texts to team-mates but also sent them to Patston in error. 

Beale faces an disciplinary hearing over the incident this week which is expected to result in the termination of his Australia contract, which in any case is due to expire at the end of the year. 

Patston quit her role over the incident last Friday and her full exchange with Beale, which happened in June while the team were in a Brisbane hotel before the first Test against France, can also be revealed. 

According to the The Daily Telegraph, Ms Patston told Beale she couldn't stop crying after receiving the offensive text messages. 

'What did I do to you? I have barely known you a day. I can't stop crying I am so humiliated by this,' Ms Patston texted to Beale. 'Don't you think my job is hard enough with this?' 

Beale replied four minutes later, apologising for the message, telling Ms Patston she has done nothing wrong and that he does 'stupid things for no reason'. 

PATSTON (1:08pm)

'I am sitting here in the team room doing my job and I can't stop crying. What did I do to you? You have barely known me a day. I can't stop crying I am so humiliated by this. Don't you think my job is hard enough without this? This is how the only female staff member is treated? I am so embarrassed by this I am leaving for my room I can't stop crying thanks a lot.'

BEALE (1.12pm)

'We all see how hard you work for us. I just do stupid things for no reason... I hate that I have done this to you & I am so sorry di.'

PATSTON (1.15pm)

'Just leave me alone this is not ok. Do you realise the situation you've put me in? I have earned this job and I am proud of being a female and this level. If I complain then I make it hard for women in Rugby and it puts the reputation of the entire squad at stake.' 

After Kurtley Beale and Di Patston met in a Brisbane hotel room 

PATSTON (3.44pm)

'Glad we got the chance to catch up and talk it through. I wanted you to look me in the eyes and realise I am a person - a mum, wife and daughter (all those things we discussed) and how they would feel seeing what you sent me. I'll never know who you sent them to or why; but everyone deserves a chance. You were clearly upset and showed remorse which I am for (sic).'

BEALE (3.48pm) 

'I can't believe you're not going to tell Ewen or the ARU this means so much to me & I have learned my lesson I promise you. You have been evry kind to me di and I'll never do anything like this again. Seeing you so upset hurt me I couldn't deal with it. You have my respect & deserve better you do so much & work so hard. Wish I could take it back. Thankyou di.'

Ms Patston then fired back, telling Beale to leave her alone. 'Do you realise the situation I am in? Just leave me alone please.' 

After a further apology from Beale, Ms Patston asked whether he was sorry for sending the message - or for being caught. 

Around two hours after their  exchange began, Ms Patston and Beale met to discuss the matter in a hotel room with three Wallabies players present. 

Ms Patston forgave Beale, promising to keep the offending texts secret - but swore she would only keep her silence if no other incidents occurred. 

After they met, she messaged him to assure him the ARU would not find out about the texts. 

'I wanted you to look me in the eyes and realise I am a person - a mum, wife and daughter... and how they would feel seeing what you sent me,' Ms Patston wrote to Beale after their meeting.

'I'll never know who you sent them to or why, but everybody deserves a chance.' 

'You were clearly upset and showed remorse which I am for (sic).' 

Beale is currently not available to Ewan McKenzie after being suspended by Australia

The rugby star promised the then-business manager he would 'never do anything like this again.'

'I can't believe you're not going to Ewen (McKenzie, the Australia coach) or the ARU this means so much to me,' he replied.

'I have learned my lesson I promise you.'

'Seeing you so upset hurt me I couldn't deal with it. You have my respect & deserve so much more.'

However, Beale broke that promise when he verbally abused Patston on a flight from South Africa to South America last month, leading to Ms Patston's resignation due to stress.

The team was flying to Mendoza after their 28-10 loss to the Springboks in Cape Town.

Beale is believed to have made a sarcastic comment to Ms Patston when she asked him to change into an item of Wallabies team gear, which sparked a heated exchange.

The Integrity Unit announced an investigation into the matter and Beale was not selected to play in the 21-17 defeat by Argentina the following Saturday.

After Beale's second offence, Ms Patston is understood to have notified McKenzie and ARU officials about the offending texts Beale had sent four months earlier.

Beale's playing future is now in doubt, as he prepares to face two separate code of conduct hearings.

The first hearing will take place early this week and exclusively address the text messages. It's expected to end with Beale's contract be terminated. 

Wallabies captain Michael Hooper came out in Beale's defence on Sunday, saying the 25-year-old does not deserve to be sacked.

'I hope KB stays in rugby union and Australian Rugby Union,' said Hooper. 'We are backing Kurtley.I enjoy having him around the team and he is quality on the field.'
