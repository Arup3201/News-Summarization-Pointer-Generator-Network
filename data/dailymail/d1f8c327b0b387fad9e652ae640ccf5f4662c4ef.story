Back in March it was revealed that supermodel Kate Upton would be taking over the reigns from Katie Holmes as the face of Bobbi Brown.

And the curvy Vogue cover girl is certainly pulling out all the stops to prove her worth as a model for the beauty giant.

Kate, 22, was only unveiled as the face of the new Surf and Sand collection a few weeks ago but she's already back for round two.

Now THAT's how you rock a red lip! Kate Upton, who was unveiled as the new face of Bobbi Brown in March, is fronting the Crazy for Colour campaign, a collection of 30 new lip color shades

Kate is fronting the Crazy for Colour campaign, a collection of 30 new lip color shades because, as Bobbi says, 'one lipstick is never enough'.

Featuring both new and back-by-popular-demand shades, from nudes to brights; Kate shows off the new tones with the help of her perfect pout.

Perfect pout: Kate seems to be excited about the collaboration, exclaiming to Bobbi, founder of the brand: 'You're such an inspiration and your products have been everywhere growing up'

Behind the scenes: Kate seems to be wholeheartedly throwing herself into her role new for the beauty brand

Grand unveiling: Kate Upton was announced as the new 
face of Bobbi Brown cosmetics in March and her new campaign for the Surf
 and Sand collection has now been unveiled

Bobbi Brown announced Kate as its new 
ambassador via Instagram in March writing: 'Proud to announce @KateUpton
 as the new face of Bobbi Brown - a beautiful, confident, empowered 
woman.'

Miss Upton was chosen for the role by make-up artist 
and founder Bobbi Brown herself, who reveals in a YouTube video that she
 was looking for a 'confident' and 'independent' new 
ambassador.

Her latest muse appeared to be equally excited about the collaboration, exclaiming: 'You're such an inspiration and your products have been everywhere growing up.

All smiles: Make-up mogul Bobbie Brown and Miss Upton appeared to have great fun working together

'My mom always used them, we always used them.'

Miss Upton is the second celebrity to work with Bobbi Brown, following on from actress Katie Holmes who signed a deal with the company in 2012.

Kate, who 
prefers the natural look on herself, opened up her make-up bag to 
reveal how she gets that 'low maintenance' glow.

She told MailOnline: 'I love Bobbi Brown mascara and moisturiser so 
those are always in there. I also always use lip balm so I make sure I 
have one with me wherever I go.'

Describing 
her own personal style, she said: 'I would describe it as a combination 
of laid-back casual, sexy and sophisticated.'

The
 curvy Vogue cover girl, who is a mouthpiece for positive body image in 
the industry, says that she's been enjoying some time in London and has been 
squeezing in some sightseeing.

She
 is also a huge fan of one of Britain's favourite sports; tennis. 'Yeah,
 I love tennis,' she said. 'My whole family enjoys the game. I wish I 
could have made it to a match.'

Former face: Actress Katie Holmes, 35, was the ambassador for Bobbi Brown for just over a year

Mother-of-three Bobbi Brown, 56, founded her eponymous beauty firm in 1991.

Four years later she sold the business to Estee Lauder but to this day she maintains complete creative control.

Talking about her newest recruit, Miss Upton, the New Jersey-based make-up mogul concluded: 'Kate came to the shoot without a stitch of makeup; she is the girl next door, really fresh and the epitome of all-American.

'She not only represents beauty - although I think all women are beautiful - but she has incredibly good energy. She is happy, she is strong, she is smart, she is open, and she is really versatile.

'She’s starting to act, she’s a model; she speaks eloquently about confidence and self-esteem, which is really important to me. I think she’ll be a great [role model] for young girls to look up to.'
