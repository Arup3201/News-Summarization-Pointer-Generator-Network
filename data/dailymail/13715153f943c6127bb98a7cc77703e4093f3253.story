The man who through a bottle at Usain Bolt and the other competitors in the men's 100m Olympic final was spared jail today.

Ashley Gill-Webb, who blamed his actions on bipolar disorder, was sentenced to an eight-week community order at Thames Magistrates' Court.

Last month he was found guilty of public disorder at Stratford Magistrates' Court, near the Olympic Park where he disrupted the sprint final on August 5.

Gill-Webb, 34, from South Milford near Leeds, snuck in to the stadium using an old ticket.

He hurled abuse at athletes including Mr Bolt, the eventual winner of the race, and threw a plastic beer bottle on to the track at the moment the highly anticipated event was beginning.

The bottle landed behind the lane markers as the world's top sprinters exploded out of their blocks in the showpiece race.

Gill-Webb will be electronically monitored and be subject to a 7pm to 7am curfew. He was also ordered to pay a £1,500 contribution to costs.

District judge William Ashworth criticised the defendant for trying to ruin the experience for athletes and spectators, but added that his mental illness was partly to blame.

'Your intention was to target the highest-profile event at the London Olympic and put off Usain Bolt,' he said today.

'The potential harm of triggering a false start was significant. By good fortune, you failed. You did, however, spoil the occasion for some spectators and tarnish the spirit of the Games.

'You suffer from bipolar disorder. At the time of the offence, you were in the throes of a manic episode. This made you over-confident and your behaviour risky.

'I have reduced your punishment to take account of the effects of your illness.'

Gill-Webb was found guilty of intending to cause the runners harassment, alarm or distress by using threatening, abusive or disorderly behaviour, contrary to Section 4 of the Public Order Act.

The judge said the man's behaviour was serious enough to require punishment, but said he thought he was unlikely to offend again.

After the sentence was handed down, Gill-Webb breathed a sigh of relief and smiled at his wife as he left the dock.

Prosecutor Helen Shaw argued in court that the high-profile nature of the incident warranted a harsher sentence.

'Some of the people who were in that area missed the event and had paid up to £4,000 a ticket,' she said, describing the race as a 'once-in-a-four-year event watched by millions of people around the world'.

Tom Barley, defending, admitted that his client looked like 'a drunken yob' and said he had inflicted 'massive embarrassment' on his fellow countrymen who were hosting the Games.

However, he noted that the father of two had not been drinking, and had already lost his job thanks to the publicity surrounding the case.

The lawyer said that for a sufferer of mental illness, 'It must have been the worst day for it to happen, in the 100m final.'

Champion: Despite the incident, Jamaica's Usain Bolt still went retain his Olympic crown in the 100m final

Gill-Webb is currently undergoing treatment for bipolar disorder.

The court earlier heard that Gill-Webb had pushed his way to the front of an exclusive seating area and started shouting: 'Usain, I want you to lose. Usain, you are bad, you are an a*******,' before throwing the bottle.

Dutch judo champion Edith Bosch confronted him about the incident, before police escorted him from the stadium and arrested him.

After his arrest, he insisted he was the Scottish actor Alan Cumming, and later said he had no memory of the incident.

Mr Bolt, the world record-holder and defending champion, won the 100m final in 9.63 seconds, ahead of Jamaican team-mate Yohan Blake, while the U.S.'s Justin Gatlin won bronze.

The gold and silver medal-winners later said they had not noticed the disruption, but Mr Gatlin described it as 'a little distraction'.
