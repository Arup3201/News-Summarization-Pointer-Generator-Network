He was darling of Goodison Park this time last year, hailed by supporters for bringing back ‘the School of Science’.

Having got Everton playing a slick, fast brand of football that almost took them into the Champions League, Roberto Martinez could do no wrong but, suddenly, he has become the topic of an increasingly heated debate.

The argument? He needs to change and get Everton playing a more solid and direct style, like David Moyes favoured. Maybe some watched Real Sociedad’s backs-to-the-wall victory against Barcelona and were reminded of similar big wins that their former manager had inspired. 

Roberto Martinez is under pressure at Everton with his team lying just four points ahead of the relegation zone

Everton have been struggling in the Premier League and have failed to hit the heights of last season

A 2-0 defeat by Hull on New Year's Day was Everton's fourth Premier League loss in a row

In many ways, Saturday’s match against Manchester City would have suited Moyes perfectly. He had an outstanding record against them, drilling his players to stay in two banks of four before pouncing on the break or at a set-piece. Everton were a persistent thorn in City’s side. 

But I will be honest — talk of Martinez needing to change is baffling. He has said he is not a manager who will play percentage football. He has principles and it should be remembered he got the job at Everton on the back of hatching a plan that toppled City in the 2013 FA Cup final.

These same people 12 months ago were saying Moyes should have been more open and dynamic like Martinez yet here they are saying Martinez now needs to be pragmatic like Moyes. So where is the consistency?

Everything he has worked on over the past 18 months, all his principles, get thrown out of the window if he switches. Had Martinez felt ‘defence first’ was the way to take Everton forward, he’d have been doing it since day one. 

Look at Brendan Rodgers. A few weeks ago, Liverpool were criticised for being too open, so he made them solid and took seven points out of nine, conceding one goal. Yet that wasn’t him. As soon as he could, he got his technical players back in the team.

Do not take this as me trying to sugarcoat a sequence of four consecutive losses in the Barclays Premier League — Everton’s worst run since December 2005 — and a last-gasp draw against West Ham in the FA Cup. But to suggest the manager’s position might be vulnerable is madness.

David Moyes saw his Real Sociedad side beat Barcelona last Sunday in La Liga

An own goal from Barcelona defender Jordi Alba was enough for Real Sociedad to earn a 1-0 victory

So it should not be about him changing or copying what Moyes did: it is about being better at what he does. He will recognise better than anyone that performances have not been good enough and issues need to be addressed.

Confidence is a problem. Everton threw away four points in the first two games against Leicester and Arsenal and Martinez thinks the scars remain. You can see that. When Everton are confident, they are aggressive and the ball moves quickly. Without confidence, they are laboured and ponderous.

Other aspects need to be factored in. Phil Jagielka, Leighton Baines and Tim Howard have not been at their best. Is that down to the lingering effects of the World Cup or is it because they are another year older? What about Sylvain Distin (37) and Gareth Barry (33) too? Everton have several players ageing in the same area of the pitch.

Is that why, after 20 games, they have conceded 33 goals compared with 19 at this stage last season — or is it because Martinez hasn’t tweaked things to make them less exposed? 

Brendan Rodgers has seen his Liverpool side struggle this season, much like Martinez

Then there are the effects of the Europa League. Everton have been superb in Europe. They beat Wolfsburg, who are second in the Bundesliga, home and away and finished top of their group. That shows there is a good side waiting to emerge. 

Does playing in Europe liberate them? There is no doubt the added games have hindered domestic results — they have taken only seven points from 18 after Europa League fixtures — but at least that dream is alive, unlike the target in August, which was Champions League qualification.

They won’t get into the top four and that will also play on the minds of players who got so close last year. When Liverpool almost won the title in 2009, we lost two of our 38 games. The following season, we lost two of our first three. Psychologically, it becomes difficult when belief wanes.

When you then factor in the devastating injuries to John Stones and James McCarthy — players who bring the best out of Jagielka and Barry — you can see why Everton are in the bottom half of the table but, even if they lose to City, I don’t see them fighting relegation.

Sylvain Distin reached the age of 37 in December

I remember a similar situation to this in January 1997. Everton had a run of four straight defeats, which included an FA Cup shock against Bradford. 

A few weeks later, they hastily and unexpectedly parted company with manager Joe Royle.

Royle had saved the club from relegation, won the FA Cup in 1995 and got Everton back into the top six but losing him set them back years. 

Only when chairman Bill Kenwright brought in Moyes did they begin to move forward again.

The club really found their stride last season. Martinez, who has the best win percentage of any Everton manager in the Premier League era, masterminded a double over Manchester United, a 3-0 demolition of Arsenal and inflicted Jose Mourinho’s first defeat since his return to England.

What the noise around Martinez has shown, is that football — more than ever before — is about winning and his task now is to give Evertonians ‘proper’ memories. He has to find a way of bringing silverware to Goodison.

He delivered a club Premier League record of 72 points and while that was fantastic, it won’t live long in the memory. City’s emergence and the financial strength of other clubs means getting into the top four will always be a struggle.

Winning a cup, however, should not be impossible. When I was kid watching the 1987 title-winning side, nobody would have believed only one more trophy would be added in the next 28 years.

That is the only thing Martinez should be worried about changing.

Simeone makes me want to put my boots back on!

The Ballon d’Or is awarded to the world’s best player in Zurich on Monday but I am far more interested in who is named coach of the year.

Carlo Ancelotti, for securing Real Madrid’s 10th Champions League, and World Cup winner Joachim Low will have their supporters but if it was down to me, the prize would go to the third man on the shortlist — Diego Simeone.

His work with Atletico Madrid, which was crowned by winning La Liga last season, has been unbelievable for the past three years and I watched in awe again on Wednesday night when he inspired his side in the Copa del Rey to a third consecutive victory over Real.

That is three straight derby wins after losing the Champions League final to their neighbours. You would have thought losing in Lisbon would have had a psychological impact on Atleti but nothing could be further from the truth.

Simeone is the type of manager you would run through a brick wall for — I’d even come out of retirement for him! — and you can see his squad have total belief in him. He would be a magnificent addition to our game.

In some ways, Atleti remind me of the Liverpool sides I played for under Rafa Benitez and Gerard Houllier. We might not have been the easiest on the eye but we had absolute belief that wherever we went in Europe we would get a result. Simeone has given that to Atleti.

This week I'm looking forward to... Pardew’s League debut with Palace

So the big question for Crystal Palace’s new manager is whether he can have the same effect as Tony Pulis and keep his side in the Premier League.

Alan Pardew has a tough baptism against rejuvenated Tottenham today but his first game as Newcastle manager was against Liverpool in December 2010. Newcastle won that 3-1.

Some seem surprised he has made the move but, in many ways, it makes a lot of sense. Geographically, it will help his family and professionally he will get more help from his board and supporters.

Pardew  is a good manager and I admire that he has been working in the Barclays Premier League for a long time.

It will be interesting to see how things map out at club for which he has a genuine affinity.
