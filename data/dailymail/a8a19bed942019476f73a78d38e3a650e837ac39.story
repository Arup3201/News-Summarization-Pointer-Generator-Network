A ground steward who checked in all the passengers boarding the doomed Malaysia Airlines plane at Amsterdam airport has paid tribute to the victims.

Renuka Manisha Virangna Birbal posted a heartfelt tribute to the 298 travellers and crew who were killed when the Boeing 777 was shot down over Ukraine on Thursday.

The tribute was posted on Facebook and has already been shared more than 8,000 times.

SCROLL DOWN FOR TRIBUTE IN FULL

Tributes: A woman lights a candle outside the Embassy of the Netherlands in Kiev to commemorate victims of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17

Renuka writes how she spoke to the passengers while checking them in before they boarded the plane, which was scheduled to fly to Kuala Lumpur.

Describing ‘smiles and happy faces’, she explains how one family of six told her: ‘After a long time we’re returning home.’

She writes how children smiled and waved at her, with one asking their mother: ‘Mom when do we see our luggage again?’ 

Renuka describes grandmothers taking 
photos of their grandchildren; a man who is about to start a new life in
 Malaysia; a newly married couple jetting off on their honeymoon.

Controversial move: Malaysia Airlines used a route over Syria war zone just days after its jet, pictured, was hit by a missile flying over Ukraine 

In the moving tribute, she also reveals how one man said his was flying to attend his mother’s funeral; and how she recognises one man travelling with his wife and children who says to her: ‘See you soon’.

Renuka signs off the post with: ‘The last time I saw them, talked to them and wish them a pleasant flight the passengers of flight MH017 on 17 July 14.

‘One last smile, one last salute, a happy face...

‘Rest in peace dear passengers & crew.’ Adding: ‘On behalf of the ground handling agents of flight MH017.’ 

A smile, a greeting, a happy face…

At the transfer desk, I get two football fanatics, one is checked in and the other not, ‘can you check me in Love’.

They were not seated next to each other in the business compartment, ‘would you like to sit together sir?’

Any doubt, I want a few hours of rest joked the other one. ‘Cheers.’

A loving family of six with their 10 pieces luggage that I had to put in the system. ‘After long time we're returning home.’

It was busy at the check in desk, so I went there to help my colleagues. A child smiling and waving at me.

They thank me for my help so she could sit together. Excited children ‘mom when do we see our luggage again?’

The crew running towards me waving and signaling. They were ready to drop their luggage at the odd size belt.

A family get dropped off by their grandparents, kids first holiday far away.

Grandma makes photos of how her children and grand children check in. This time I do not mind that I am in the picture.

Arriving
 at the gate G03 a young man asked if he has time to buy something 
quickly. ‘Of course, sir, if you only ensures that you are back here at 
1130.’

My colleague helps an elderly woman inside, all the way to her
 seat in row 21, she had difficulty walking and traveling alone. The 
lady had the same name (one letter difference) as the son of my 
colleague and said that she would remembered the name.

I appeal to 
everyone to go to the toilet before they enter the gate because there 
are no toilet facilities at gate G03. A few passengers went back out of 
the line.

A woman traveling with her husband and her mother still 
asks her mother a few times if she had to go to the toilet, the elderly 
lady has a bladder problem.

I allowed them to wait outside and they can come inside the priority line when their ready. A newly married couple, on the way to their honeymoon.

A
 beautiful little girl hold by her mother, her father behind them 
pushing the stroller. What is she beautiful, a half Dutch half Malaysian
 with beautiful big eyes. She kindly smiled at me.

A man who could still join the flight to be on time for the funeral of his mother.

Grandchildren traveling with their grandparents.

Suddenly I see a familiar face, it is our colleague from the MH ticket counter

He proudly shows me his son, wife and daughter. With a big smile he waved ‘See you soon’.A
 woman want to go out of the gate unable to go to the toilet, 
unfortunately, we have already begun boarding and nobody can go out. 
‘May I board first then?’ of course.

I walk quickly along with the last two passengers who may eventually join the flight, and what are they happy...

A final farewell to the crew, till next time!

And then we removed the bridge.

Passengers
 traveling for business, on the way home, on the way to family, on the 
way to their holiday, on the way to a new beginning...

Group travel, 
families, couples, individuals, infants, children, grandmothers, 
grandfathers, mothers, fathers, sons, daughters, partners, uncles, 
aunts, colleagues, friends, neighbors, acquaintances.The last time I saw them, talked to them and wish them a pleasant flight the passengers of flight MH017 on 17 July 14.

One last smile, one last salute, a happy face ...

+ Rest in peace dear passengers & crew +
