Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York announced yesterday that there are now 91 'Texting Zone' areas along New York's major highways and thruways.

'Texting and driving could cost someone their life, but these 'text stops' will cost absolutely nothing to build as they are already exist in the form of rest stops and parking areas.

According to texting and driving statistics, looking at one's cell phone for 5 seconds is equal to driving 55mph for the length of an American football field without ever looking at the road.

Gov. Cuomo announced yesterday that a total of 298 signs that read, 'It can wait, Text Stop 5 miles,' will be positioned along New York State's busiest roads.

'New York State is continuing to use every tool at its disposal to combat texting-while-driving,'Cuomo said in a release announcing the 'Text Stop' plan. 'In addition to tougher penalties, new detection methods for state police and ongoing public outreach efforts, we are now launching special Texting Zones to allow motorists to pull over and use their phones.'

Law Enforcement is cracking down on texting and driving. Recent data shows that New York State police handed out 21,580 tickets for distracted driving this summer compared to 5,208 in the same period a year earlier.

The 365 percent increase not only points to an increased crackdown, it also points to the severity of the problem. Some people feel they really 'cant wait.'

Gov. Cuomo said in his announcement yesterday, ' If you wait until you're in a rest area or service area you literally could be saving someone's life and that life could be your own.'

He added, 'With this new effort, we are sending a clear message to drivers that there is no excuse to take your hands off the wheel and eyes off the road because your text can wait until the next 'Texting Zone.'
