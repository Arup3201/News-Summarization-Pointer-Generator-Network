Two dozen people have been arrested in connection with the mine disaster in Turkey, as relatives today buried the last of its more than 300 victims.

General manager Ramazan Dogru and operations manager Akin Celik were among the 24 detained five days after a fire ripped through the mine in Soma, west Turkey, choking and incinerating workers.

The disaster has sparked violent protests across Turkey, directed at mine owners accused of ignoring safety for profit, and at Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's government, which is seen as too close to industry bosses.

But today the mood in the town of Soma was more measured and downbeat, as mourners paid their respects to the last two miners pulled dead from the mine yesterday.

As authorities scrabbled to show they were taking the tragedy seriously, prosecutors were today weighing charges of negligence and contributing to the deaths of more than one person, Dogan news agency said.

Police had cordoned off the courthouse in Soma this afternoon as a growing crowd of onlookers, journalists and relatives gathered outside, Reuters said.

One woman told the agency her engineer husband was among those detained inside and one man, whose engineer brother was being held, said dozens of people had been questioned as part of the probe. Both declined to be named.

'We know that we have lost 301 loved ones, but we have loved ones inside as well,' the man said.

The arrests and investigation comes despite the government and company officials repeatedly insisting that the mine was inspected regularly and negligence was not a factor in Tuesday's tragedy.

But reacting to widespread public anger, government officials promised to investigate and pledged that any mine officials found to be negligent would be punished.

The Milliyet newspaper said Saturday that a preliminary report by a mine safety expert who inspected the Soma mine suggested that smoldering coal caused the mine's roof to collapse.

The report said the tunnel's support beams were made of wood, not metal, and the mine had too few carbon monoxide sensors.

Company officials have described safety standards as high, noting that the mine contained 50 gas sensors and employees were provided with gas masks.

At a news conference on Friday, Celik,
 one of those now held for questioning, admitted thick smoke from the 
underground fire killed many miners who weren't carrying gas masks.

Rescue workers entering the mine complained of high levels of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide.

'There
 is no negligence,' Celik said. 'I have been doing this job for 20 years
 but I have never seen anything like this. We would not want harm to 
come to a single fingernail of our workers.'

Yesterday,
 rescue workers sealed the entrance to the mine after bringing out the 
bodies of the last two miners missing in the disaster, putting the final
 death toll at 301.

This 
morning mourners cried and prayed beside a line of recently filled 
graves as the pair were buried alongside their co-workers in a cemetery 
in Soma.

Holding their palms
 open to the sky, around a thousand people said 'amen' in unison as a 
white-bearded imam finished reciting verses.

A
 handwritten note left beside flowers on one grave said: 'My only wish 
and battle will be to make sure Soma is not forgotten.' It was signed 
'your brother'.

A worker from a nearby mine, who gave his name only as Ramazan, was among those paying his respects.

'My friend lost half of his family,' he said. 'And for what? To make a living.

'Accidents
 can happen of course, but it's an accident when one person, two people 
die. When 300 people die, its not an accident anymore.'

Police
 have put Soma on lockdown, setting up checkpoints and detaining dozens 
of people to enforce a ban on protests after several thousand 
demonstrators clashed with police on Friday.

Dozens
 of people were arrested and held yesterday as hundreds of riot police 
patrolled the streets while others checked identity cards at three 
checkpoints on the road into town.

The
 checkpoints remained in place today but those detained, including eight
 lawyers from the Contemporary Jurists Association, were released by 
Saturday evening, media reports said.

There
 were fresh clashes between police and protesters in Istanbul and Ankara
 last night amid anger at the government's handling of the disaster.

Prime
 Minister Erdogan's opponents blame the government for privatising the 
state-controlled mines, turning them over to politically connected 
businessmen who they say may have skimped on safety to maximise profit.

Mr
 Erdogan has presided over a decade of rapid economic growth but 
workplace safety standards have failed to keep pace, leaving Turkey with
 one of the world's worst industrial accident records.
