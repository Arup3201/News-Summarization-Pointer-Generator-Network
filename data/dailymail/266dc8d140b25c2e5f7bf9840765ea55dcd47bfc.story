New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick has broken his silence over former tight end Aaron Hernandez's murder charge, saying he was 'personally disappointed and hurt' to learn of the investigation.

Hernandez, who was released from the team after he was arrested on June 26, has been accused of shooting dead semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd on June 18 and remains in jail.

And in yet another twist on Wednesday, a report claimed Hernandez has also become the focus of a double 
homicide investigation involving two men who were shot dead in Boston 
last year.

Speaking at a press conference, Belichick said the Patriots will learn from 'this terrible experience' and said he feels hurt by Hernandez's actions after having faith in him.

'It's a sad day, it's a really a sad day on so many levels,' he said. 'A young man lost his life. And his family's suffered a tragic loss and there's no way to understate that.

'Disappointed': New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick addresses the media on Wednesday regarding the criminal charges against Aaron Hernandez, and said he was shocked and hurt

'I and other members were shocked and disappointed in what we had learned... Having someone in your organization that's involved in a murder investigation is a terrible thing. After consultation with ownership, we acted swiftly and decisively.'

He said that, as the coach, he said he was responsible for the players and felt personally let down by Hernandez.

'Overall, I'm proud of the hundreds of players that have come through this program,' he said. 'But I'm personally disappointed and hurt in a situation like this.'

On Wednesday, a Massachusetts judge gave prosecutors more time to present evidence to a grand jury in their case against Hernandez, who was in court for a probably cause hearing.

All smiles: Hernandez smiles as he arrives for his probable cause hearing at Attleboro District Court on Wednesday - but the hearing was pushed back until August as more evidence has allegedly emerged

Charges: Hernandez, pictured in court on Wednesday, has pleaded not guilty to murdering friend Odin Lloyd

The hearing has now been pushed back until August 22 and Hernandez will be held without bail.

Bristol
County Assistant DA William McCauley said additional evidence has come 
to light, including boxes of ammunition found at a condominium Hernandez
leased and a magazine clip for a .45-caliber Glock in a Hummer 
registered to him.

Police say Lloyd was killed with a .45-caliber gun. McCauley said the box had Hernandez's fingerprints on it.

Hernandez
attorney James Sultan objected to the delay, saying his client has 
already been jailed for four weeks, but the judge sided with the 
prosecution.

In a separate case, prosecutors are also presenting evidence in the drive-by shooting deaths of Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu, 29, and Safiro Furtad, 28, to a Suffolk County Grand Jury, MyFoxBoston reported.

Support: Shayanna Jenkins, Hernandez's fiancee, is pictured in court on Wednesday

The former NFL star, 23, could now face an indictment in the case.

It
was reported last month that Odin Lloyd could have known about 
Hernandez's alleged involvement in the 2012 double murder and Hernandez 
reportedly killed him to keep him quiet.

'The
motive might have been that the victim (Lloyd) knew (Hernandez) might 
have been involved,' unidentified police officials told The Boston 
Globe.

The July 15, 2012 shooting took place after a fight broke out inside Cure, a South End nightclub.

It was reported that Abreu and Furtado got into an argument with a group of other patrons, including Hernandez.

Tough: Belichick arrives to speak to the media and passes on his condolences to the victim's family

Sadness: As he spoke to the media, he called it a 'sad day' and called news of the killing a 'terrible thing'

Address: The coach said he will learn from the experience and now hopes the Patriots can look forward

As Abreu drove away from the club in his BMW with Furtado in the passenger's seat, a silver or grey SUV with Rhode Island license plates pulled up to the car and started shooting.

There were other men in the BMW who all survived the attack but both Furtado and Abreu died.

The
exact motive behind the killings of the two friends, who worked 
together for a cleaning company, is not known. The men did not know 
Hernandez, their relatives have said.

Police have not said how Hernandez is
specifically linked to the silver or grey SUV in question, but they 
have cited a connection to the vehicle as the reason for their 
suspicion.

New charges? Prosecutors are presenting evidence linking Aaron Hernandez, pictured in June, to a double homicide in 2012, it has emerged. He is already in jail facing murder charges

Officers recently towed a silver SUV with Rhode Island plates from the home of Aaron Hernandez's uncle in Bristol, Connecticut, Fox reported.

They made a connection 
between Hernandez and the double homicide after the former NFL star fell in the spotlight for Lloyd's killing, The Boston Globe reported.

Boston police and the district 
attorney declined to comment on the report, citing confidentiality. The 
grand jury proceedings are held behind closed doors so the exact details
are not known.

In 
Massachusetts, people charged with murder must be indicted by a grand 
jury before they can be put on trial. The grand jury will listen to 
prosecutors and witnesses before they make their decision.

Killing: The men were leaving the club in a BMW when someone started shooting from an SUV, killing them

The report comes as Hernandez 
prepares to make another court appearance for a probable cause hearing 
in the murder case against him. He will appear in Attleboro District 
court this afternoon.

He
has pleaded not guilty to murder in the death of Odin Lloyd, a 
27-year-old Boston semi-professional football player whose body was 
found June 17 in an industrial park in North Attleborough near 
Hernandez's home. He had been shot five times.

Prosecutors say Hernandez 
orchestrated Lloyd's killing because he was upset at him for talking to 
people Hernandez had problems with at a nightclub a few days earlier.

They say he and two others, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, drove with Lloyd to the scene.

Authorities
have not said who fired the shots, but documents filed in Florida - and
released since Hernandez's last court appearance - paint the former 
Patriot as the triggerman.

Accused: Aaron Hernandez, formerly of the New 
England Patriots looks during a game against the Seattle Seahawks in 
2012 - The football player is accused of killing Odin Lloyd (right) in 
June of this year

Allegations: Carlos Ortiz, (center), is shown during a hearing in court in Bristol, Connecticut in June. He faces a gun charge but has told authorities that Hernandez confessed to the murder

According to the records, Ortiz told police that Wallace said Hernandez fired the shots.

Hernandez's lawyers say the case against him is circumstantial and he wants to clear his name.

He is being held without bail at a county jail, where he stays in a 7ft by 10ft prison cell alone for 21 hours a day - which a world away from his $1.3 million mansion in North Attleborough.

Wallace
and Ortiz also are facing charges. Wallace pleaded not guilty to a 
charge of being an accessory to murder after the fact. Ortiz has pleaded
not guilty to a gun charge.
