Avid fans of the Star Wars films may think they have seen every frame and heard every word from the six-part saga, but as Yoda would say: 'Wrong, they are.'

A segment of the 1983 film Return Of The Jedi has been discovered, which has around 30 minutes of unreleased footage - including outtakes, alternate takes and behind-the-scenes direction.

The 'lost' footage turned up on a LaserDisc, a large-format forerunner of the DVD, and contains an early take of a scene on Yoda's home planet in the Dagobah system.

A long-lost disc, from a technology far far away: The LaserDisc with printed label that shows it's a LucasFilm-designed EditDroid demo of scene 50 from Return Of The Jedi

Luke Skywalker has returned to finish his Jedi training, but he finds a physically weakened Yoda, who complains about his age and ill-health. Suddenly, indignant at the thought that a young Skywalker may be mocking him because of his age, Yoda delivers the now-famous line: 'When 900 years you reach, look as good you will not.'

The rough take shows how Frank Oz - Muppet Show creator and the voice of Yoda - developed the unique phrasing and vocal range of the little green Jedi master.

Another minute-long clip from the LaserDisc shows Luke Skywalker's faithful droid R2D2 repairing an X-fing fighter - both machines looking decidedly out of place on the overgrown Dagobah surface.

Both clips have been put up on a special Facebook page, and more footage is promised in the near future.

In the 1980s, Star Wars creator George Lucas and his team at LucasFilm devised the EditDroid editing system for film and television, which used the LaserDisc technology.

Instead of printing daily takes on film stock, processed negatives from the camera would be mastered onto LaserDisc, similar to burning DVDs today.

It made it much easier to select takes and set up a rough edit for the negative cutter, who would then use the directions from the LaserDisc to cut the camera negative and assemble the finished film.

Difference of scale: The 1980s LaserDisc was around the size of a vinyl LP record, and dwarfs the modern DVD

Only 24 EditDroid systems were built. The invention of less cumbersome and less glitch-prone technology saw them phased out - which is why the discovery of the Return Of The Jedi LaserDisc is so exciting for film fans.

The LP-record-sized LaserDiscs were popular among video enthusiasts because they provided a better-quality product than its contemporary rivals VHS or Beta.

Copy on the Facebook page, saying that the footage was never officially released, reads: 'Now here's the amazing part for you Star Wars freaks out there... Approximately 30 minutes of unedited raw, unsweetened work-print takes in letterbox format of scene 50 (Luke on Dagobah with Yoda) from Return Of The Jedi were used... Slates, people yelling action, multiple takes of the same scenes of Luke and Yoda.'

Eventually the full 30 minutes will be released in snippets - and no-doubt other Star Wars aficionados the world over will be scanning their sections of the solar system in search of more LaserDiscs laden with other outtakes.
