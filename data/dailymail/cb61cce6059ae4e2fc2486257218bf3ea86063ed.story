A kamikaze driver who downed sleeping pills and booze before smashing his car into a listed house in a bid to kill himself has been jailed for two-and-a-half years.

Grant Bond, 23, even called the Samaritans before he aimed his car at the former toll house at 5.30am on August 15 last year.

Pensioner Barry Lea and wife Irene were in the house with their daughter when the Silver Ford Fiesta crashed through the front wall of their home, causing £80,000 worth of damage.

Astonishingly all four of them survived, Bond was left with a 'catalogue' of serious injuries including a broken pelvis.

The crash caused £80,000 worth of damage to the Grade-II listed Toll House at Weethley Gate

Last week Bond, from Alcester, Warkwickshire, was jailed at Warwick Crown Court after admitting causing damage being reckless whether life was endangered and dangerous driving.

The court heard that Bond aimed the car at the wall of the Grade-II listed South Lodge Old Toll House in Weethley, Warkwickshire.

Bond smashed into the dining room of the listed building, injuring the owner's daughter and leaving her with whiplash injuries and suffering from flashbacks.

Caging him Judge Richard Griffith-Jones described Bond as 'wicked' and told him he had put others' lives at risk.

He said: 'It was a wicked thing to do. In the terrible circumstances of intending to take your own life, the way you did it was to risk the lives of others.

'His history is a sad and tortured one. The problem is that if someone in that awful position decides to kill themselves by risking other people's lives, it is a very serious crime.

'I have been able to see material about your personal history. I am not going to recite it in public, but you have had serious difficulties in your life.

'By August last year it is obvious that you had become desperate and determined to kill yourself, which is an awful position for anyone to be in.

'I don't want you to think that when I described your behaviour as wicked I am ignoring the degree of desperation you had reached, nor is it a case where you were so clear-thinking that you identified someone's house and decided you were going to drive into it, not caring about who may also lose their life.

'Without really giving proper consideration to what it was you were driving at you drove straight at that lodge.

Repairs to the building to return it to the state it was in before the crash are almost completed

'It was a wicked thing to do.'

Mr Lea told police he heard a noise like a low flying bomber just seconds before the Fiesta slammed through the wall.

He looked out of the kitchen window to see the car careering towards him at breakneck speed.

The court heard that Bond had called police in the hours before the smash, telling them he was suicidal, but did not want to be arrested.

In interview after the incident he said he had little memory of it, but could recall sobbing before slamming into the side of what he thought was an unused shop. Bond and the Lea family did not know each other.

Geoffrey Dann, defending, said Bond was at an 'extremely low ebb' and that prison would just compound the problems.

He added that Bond had struggled since the death of his father when he was just 15.

Speaking after the hearing a spokesperson for the Lea family said: 'What is done is done, but this has had a real impact on Mr and Mrs Lea, who are in their 70s and lived at the house for 30 years.

'It is a listed building and the repairs have only just been completed.

'People say, living on a corner, the house must have been hit by cars many times but this was the first.'

The building was built in the early 19th Century as a toll house 

Bond's Ford Fiesta was left barely recognisable and firefighters were forced to cut off the doors in order to free the suicidal driver.

The toll house is currently being restored to the condition it was in, but remains covered in fences and a protective sheet.

Speaking yesterday, the Lea's daughter Jackie Hannon said the family were just looking to move on from the incident.

She said: 'I don't want to say too much but the man was local to here so should have known it was an occupied house.

'But we obviously can't say what was going through his mind at the time. We all just want to move on from it now.

'The house has been rebuilt to how it was before the crash.'
