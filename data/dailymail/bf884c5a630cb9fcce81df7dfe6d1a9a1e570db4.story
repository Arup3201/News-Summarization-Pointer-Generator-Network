The Archbishop of Canterbury today warned politicians against inflammatory language presenting immigration as a 'deep menace' to Britain.

The Most Rev Justin Welby said he was worried about the use of language in the debate amid an upsurge of abuse and urged people not to suggest new arrivals could 'overwhelm' Britain. 

His remarks came after Defence Secretary Michael Fallon sparked controversy after saying some parts of the country felt 'swamped' by immigrants.

Michael Fallon said he was 'careless' to claim some towns were being 'swamped' by immigrants

Mr Fallon today admitted he was 'a bit careless' with his words but maintained that the 'large number' of immigrants coming from the continent was putting pressure on housing and essential services in the UK.

But the Archbishop of Canterbury, speaking at a Westminster lunch today, said: 'Do I worry about the language? Yes I do, I really do.'

'We can't overburden communities, we have to be realistic about that. But at the heart of Christian teaching about the human being is that all human beings are of absolutely equal and infinite value and the language we use must reflect the value of the human being and not treat immigration as a deep menace that is somehow going to overwhelm a country that has coped with many waves of immigration and has usually done so with enormous success.

'It is part of the strength and brilliance of this country that we are so good at this, and I would hate to see us lose that.' 

Under pressure from Ukip and with a crunch by-election looming in the Rochester and Strood constituency, Mr Fallon had significantly ramped up Tory rhetoric on the sensitive issue. 

He warned that some areas felt 'under siege' and action was needed 'to prevent whole towns and communities being swamped by huge numbers of migrant workers'.

A Government source said the Defence Secretary should have 'chosen his words better' as Downing Street sought to calm the situation following Mr Fallon's comments.

But the minister stood by the substance of his remarks as he acknowledged he had been careless in his choice of language.

Mr Fallon told Sky News: 'I was a bit careless with my words, I accept that. But, yes, there is pressure now, there are a large number of people coming here from the rest of Europe - this is one of the more successful economies in Europe and there is pressure as a result of that migration on social services, on housing, on school places for example.

'That's what the Prime Minister will be addressing when he puts forward his proposals for some kind of control.' 

Labour's Keith Vaz, chairman of the influential Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said Mr Fallon's original comments had been 'nasty, inappropriate and wrong'.

Politicians have faced criticism before for the use of the word 'swamped' when talking about immigration.

In 2002, David Blunkett refused to apologise for saying asylum seekers were 'swamping' some British schools.

The then Labour Home Secretary made his remarks while defending the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill.

The Campaign for Racial Equality said they were 'hugely emotive'.

In 1978, Margaret Thatcher said people feared being 'swamped' by immigration from the new Commonwealth and Pakistan.

On the prospect of four million immigrants, she said: 'Now, that is an awful lot and I think it means that people are really rather afraid that this country might be rather swamped by people with a different culture.'

David Cameron will face questions from MPs later about his Government's increasingly fraught relationship with Europe following Brussels' shock demand for an extra £1.7 billion from the British taxpayer.

The Prime Minister is also likely to be asked about his approach to tackling immigration within the EU after Mr Fallon was effectively slapped down by Number 10 yesterday.

Mr Cameron's plan to put controlling EU immigration at the heart of his renegotiation of the UK's relationship with Brussels before an in/out referendum has been met with staunch opposition from Germany.

Finance minister Wolfgang Schauble stated that 'the basic rules of the EU are not up for negotiation' following Chancellor Angela Merkel's insistence that she would not allow 'tampering' with the principle of free movement.

Mr Schauble told the Times: 'The principle of the freedom of movement is one of the basic principles of European integration and it cannot be restricted. That would be incompatible with the European treaties.'

He added: 'There is not much room to manoeuvre . The basic rules of the EU are not up for negotiation.'

It would be 'unthinkable' to re-impose border controls within the EU, he said.

Ukip's tough line on immigration and the EU is seen as a major factor behind its surging popularity. The party came top in European elections earlier this year, and a poll has suggested it is on track to secure its second MP in the Rochester and Strood by-election on November 20 - triggered by the defection of Mark Reckless from the Tories.

After being presented with the demand for a £1.7 billion surcharge to UK budget contributions in Brussels last week, an exasperated Mr Cameron is said to have pleaded with European counterparts to cut him some slack or they could end up with Nigel Farage in his chair.

The premier has insisted the bill will not be paid by the deadline of December 1 and referred the matter to finance ministers for closer examination.

For its part, the European Commission has argued that the contribution revisions were calculated by independent statisticians using a standard formula agreed by all member states.

There are questions over why the Government did not see the problem coming months ago and Chancellor George Osborne is also under scrutiny after it emerged that he knew days before the summit but failed to tell the PM.

Ukip will try to win 100 seats at the general election as it seeks to build on a surge in support, the party's biggest donor has revealed.

Businessman Paul Sykes said the anti-EU party would widen its ambitions and invest in an ad campaign that would be 'seen from the Moon'.

Mr Sykes, who will give another £1.5 million to help step up the drive, said Ukip will be raising 'significant further funds' as it targets many more marginal seats than the few dozen it had originally identified.

The Ukip leader hopes Mr Reckless - candidate in Rochester and Strood - will become the party's second MP

He told the Sunday Times: 'Ukip is not going to lose the campaign because we don't have enough adverts.'

Research by Opinium for the Observer yesterday found that nearly a third of the public would vote Ukip if they thought it could win in their area.

Former Home Office minister Damian Green warned that it would be a 'complete disaster' if the Tories became 'Ukip-lite', urging the Conservatives to 'calm down'.
