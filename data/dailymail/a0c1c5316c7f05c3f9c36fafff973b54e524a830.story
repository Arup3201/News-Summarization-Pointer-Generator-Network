Two newlyweds returned home from honeymoon to find their house sitter had sold all of their belongings - including a camcorder containing their ‘irreplaceable’ wedding video.

Barry Holt, and his wife Claire, both 33, returned from their honeymoon in Alicante, Spain, to find items from their home in Laindon, Essex, missing.

The couple had entrusted their friend Samuel Hawker, 23, to look after the property and their two dogs while they were away.

Married: Mr and Mrs Holt, pictured on their wedding day, say the man also stole a 'priceless' video from the day

Instead, Hawker took an X-Box games console, games, cameras and jewellery to a local pawn shop and traded them in for less than £150.

The couple estimate the gold jewellery alone was worth in the region of £5,000.

It is claimed that Hawker also pawned a camcorder containing a priceless video of the couple’s wedding.

Pawned: Samuel Hawker, 23, was house-sitting for the newlyweds. It is alleged that he sold their belongings for £150

As soon as the couple returned in September this year, Hawker began acting suspiciously.

Speaking at Basildon Magistrates Court, Philip Pearson, prosecuting, said: 'They thought they had been mislaid, but Mr Hawker soon started to become agitated.

'He started saying: "I never took anything, I just stayed in the lounge".'

Hawker, of no fixed address, admitted one charge of theft and one charge of fraud in relation to falsely claiming to be the owner of the traded items. He has been released on bail ahead of sentencing next month.

Heartbroken Mrs Holt, an equine therapist, said: 'I just feel really disappointed as he was a trusted friend.

'There are a lot of things that he stole which can’t be replaced - we worked out the jewellery alone was worth £5,000 but it also had a lot of sentimental value.

'We never even got to watch our wedding video before he took the camera away - it had been wiped by the time we got it back. Those are the things that are absolutely irreplaceable.'

Mr Holt, a gas terminal operator, added: 'We are still very angry about this. It was a betrayal of our trust. If you can’t trust your friends then who can you trust?

'I gave that guy his first job years ago and I’ve known him since he was 15 so I thought we could trust him.

'We still don’t know why he did it - the amount of money he got for everything is ridiculous.

'I hope justice is done as he doesn’t deserve just a slap on the wrist - he needs to get prison time for what he has done.'

The couple said Hawker only handed himself in after they named and shamed him on a Facebook post.

Taken: The couple claim their Samsung video camera, similar to the one pictured, was taken by Hawker

Mr Holt continued: 'He kept ducking and diving to avoid admitting he had stolen everything.

'He was blaming fictional friends and family members so eventually I posted all the details on Facebook and it was shared about 900 times.

'The police have retrieved a few items, including our camcorder but our wedding video had been wiped from it.

'We still don’t know where we stand with the insurance, or if we will get anything else back.'
