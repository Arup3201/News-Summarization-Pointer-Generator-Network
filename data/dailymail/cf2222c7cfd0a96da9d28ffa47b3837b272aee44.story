Tourists and residents are pouring out of the New Jersey shore ahead of Hurricane Irene’s arrival this weekend as the state governor warned: ‘It’s time to get out.’

Summer resort towns are emptying as officials ordered mandatory evacuation of the popular tourist areas along the state's coastal barrier islands.

The mandatory evacuations cover all of the state's barrier island beach resorts and at least hundreds of thousands of people are affected by the orders.

Convoy: Sport utility vehicles pulling pleasure boats drive in lines of traffic headed north on the Garden State Parkway across the Great Egg Harbor Bay Inlet Bridge on Friday near Ocean City, New Jersey

Getting out: A police officer is on duty outside a convention centre on Friday in Atlantic City, New Jersey, which is being used as an evacuation center for hundreds of city residents fleeing the hurricane's approach

They included evacuation of such heavily visited towns as Wildwood, Ocean City and Avalon, all in Cape May County where the summer tourist population is typically around 750,000 people.

‘This is not like anything you’ve seen before,’ Governor Chris Christie said. ‘I’ve heard some dopes on television today saying a Category 2 hurricane is nothing more than a bad thunderstorm.

‘You stay there at the risk of your life. It’s that simple,’ he added. ‘Now, I want to be really clear to the folks in Cape May, and Atlantic, and Ocean County on the barrier islands. You have to get out.’

In the shore town of Ventnor, also under evacuation orders, veteran visitors and long-time residents said they had never before evacuated for a hurricane, even though the town regularly floods.

Irene was bearing down on North Carolina on Friday and New Jersey was braced for a weekend battering from the storm, with winds between 96mph and 110mph and storm surges of 6ft to 8ft.

Marvin Levey, 75, was unloading sandbags from his car to weigh down the lawn furniture in his Ventnor yard before heading home to Philadelphia.

‘I've been coming down here for over 30 years and never evacuated before,’ he said. ‘I came down to put away anything I could put away.’

Casinos and hotels in Atlantic City were closing down and emptying out as well, with Atlantic County included in the mandatory evacuation order.

Governor Christie on Thursday declared a state of emergency for New Jersey ahead of the storm.

With heavy traffic leaving the Atlantic shore areas, tolls were suspended on the Atlantic City Expressway, which heads directly to Philadelphia.

Not everyone felt the pressure to leave, said Michael Holland, 24, a lifeguard at a Ventnor beach. ‘We're supposed to tell people to leave, but they're kind of indifferent to it,’ he said.

Nearly a million people could have been covered by the mandatory evacuations depending on how many tourists were in each affected area.

All 11 of Atlantic City's casinos are shutting down as the hurricane moves toward the resort city and the rest of New Jersey. It's only the third time they have closed en masse.

They will have to shut by noon Saturday. The city's casinos have closed down only twice before - in 1985 for Hurricane Gloria and in 2006 because of a state government shutdown.
