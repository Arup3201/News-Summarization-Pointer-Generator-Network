A 'sexually obsessed' stalker whose explicit texts and phone calls caused a mother six months of torment was the very police officer sent to help her, it has emerged.

Dunstable-based Maria Snow, 49, waived her anonymity to speak of her horror at finding out PC Mark Wilkie was behind the daily calls to her mobile.

Mrs Snow recalled how former Bedfordshire Police PC would breathe heavily into the phone and tell her how attractive she was to him.

The terrifying calls started in August 2009 when Mrs Snow  was going through a difficult divorce from her husband.

Six months of hell: Maria Snow, 49, was shocked to discover her phone stalker had been the very policeman called out to help her following an argument with her husband

The couple had been arguing so violently one day that Mrs Snow's son had called the police.

PC Wilkie arrived soon after and as Mrs Snow  recalls, seemed very laid back about the ordeal.

She told the Daily Mirror: 'He was making jokes, reassuring me that there was nothing to be embarrassed about.

'Once it was confirmed no one had been hurt or was in danger, he seemed very casual.

'At the time I didn’t think much of it, but after he left I thought it was a little bit odd,' she added.

Six months later another row resulted in a second call out to police and PC Wilkie arrived once again.

Abuse of power: Mark Wilkie, 51, a former officer with Bedfordshire Police had stalked Mrs Snow for six months after being called out over a domestic incident between her and her husband

As Mrs Snow's husband was taken to the police station her mobile displayed the first in a long line of explicit texts. It read: 'You look so gorgeous and sexy'.

Thinking it was a mistake Mrs Snow  replied saying the caller must have the wrong number but, chillingly, they replied: 'No I haven't, Maria'.

Ironically she called police who discovered the offending text had come from a pay-as-you-go number which the owner always topped up with cash making it impossible to trace.

The calls and texts continued.

'It turned in to six months of texts and phone calls, every night and day. It was mental cruelty,' Mrs Snow said.

Her suspicion fell on every man she knew, she said, from 'friends' 
husbands, to someone at the gym, to people I worked with'.

And the stress and anxiety even caused her hair to break off and fall out.

She
continued: 'I didn't want to change my phone number because I had had 
it for 20 years and used it for my work, and my phone wouldn't let me 
block the calls.

'He started with one call a day and within a month it had gone up to once an hour. It was like a drip, drip torture.

'Two months in I texted back and said, "I'm in the middle of a horrible divorce, could you please stalk me in six months' time?"

'My friends would phone him and threaten him, but it didn't make any difference.

'There
was one time that I answered the phone as I was worried it might have 
been one of the children trying to contact me, and it was him.

'He said, "Hi, it's me," and I almost threw up on the spot.

'You just go into a whole world of doubt and suspicion, and it makes you realise how vulnerable you are.'

Then at the beginning of August 2010, the
contact stopped abruptly and at 
the end of December she had a phone call from the police.

An officer had been arrested with a pay-as-you-go phone he'd used to harass several other women.

Mrs Snow told the Mirror: 'I was floored. I couldn’t believe they’d managed to catch anyone, especially when it went on for so long and he hadn’t slipped up.'

She was even more surprised to find her stalker was 51-year-old Mark Wilkie.

He had been caught when his work locker was searched following an arrest for as similar offence.

Wilkie, an 
award-winning policeman commended for bravery, was jailed for three 
years and four months last year at Cambridge Crown Court after 
admitting to 12 counts of misconduct in public office over a period of 
two years.

Between 2008 and
2010 he would target women who he had met while investigating crimes, 
and would search out their numbers and details using the police's 
database.

Ordeal: Mrs Snow received daily explicit text messages and phone calls from Wilkie who even breathed heavily down the phone on occasion

Wilkie, of Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, would then
pester them using a pay-as-you-go mobile phone. Detectives 
said there may have been as many as 50 targets.

The people he stalked included victims of domestic abuse and missing teenagers.

Mrs Snow, who used to be confident and outgoing, said the harassment caused her to become 'a nervous wreck'.

In mitigation, defence counsel Hector
Maclean-Watt told the court his client's long-term relationship had 
broken down shortly before the offences started and his marriage had 
ended four years earlier.

The
judge described him as 'sexually obsessed'. He said the offences were 
'an appalling breach of trust' which undermined public confidence in the
police.

Judge Gareth 
Hawkesworth told Wilkie at the time: 'You abused the very people you were there to 
protect. This was effectively terrorising vulnerable people in breach of
trust.'

A Bedfordshire Police spokesman added: 'Wilkie's behaviour is absolutely abhorrent.'

The jailing of her tormentor, who she describes as 'a pervert', has brought little relief or joy for Mrs Snow.

'I can't be pleased at the sentence. I just feel numb and I wish I didn't have to be involved,' she said.

'I actually don't believe I trust anyone any more.

'But
I hope this will make the police take this kind of situation seriously,
and I hope it stands as a lesson to other people out there.'

Mrs Snow now wants to highlight the lasting effects stalking has on the victims.

She said: 'It still affects me - I don't know when that's going to stop.'
