Teddy Sheringham says James Wilson could score 20 goals a season for Manchester United if Louis van Gaal played him.

Sheringham has heaped praise on Wilson and claimed the exciting 19-year-old has all the attributes to be a top striker.

Talking to United Review, Sheringham, who is forwards' coach at West Ham United, takes a keen interest in strikers across the Barclays Premier League, and said: 'I really like James Wilson.

'It’s a shame for him that Radamel Falcao and Robin van Persie are in front of him. Louis van Gaal said recently that he doesn’t have a striker who can score 20 goals a season, but I think if you put Wilson up there with Wayne Rooney then you’d have two players who can reach those figures for you.'

Wilson made his first-team debut at the end of the 2013-14 season under former interim manager Ryan Giggs but has mainly been on the bench during Van Gaal's time at the club.

Having sat on the bench again for Sunday's 3-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur, Wilson was handed some playing time for the Under 21s on Monday and scored the opening goal in a 2-1 victory over Everton.

Sheringham added: 'He’s very direct, scores goals, has good pace and that added bonus of being a left-footer – they always tend to catch defenders off guard and it always looks more special when the left-footed strike goes in. 

'I like his attitude, he looks a good player, a good prospect and one that everyone needs to keep an eye on.'
