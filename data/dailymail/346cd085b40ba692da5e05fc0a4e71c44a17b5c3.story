The teenage girl shot by the Taliban for speaking out against militants in Pakistan is expected to make Britain her permanent home.

Malala Yousufzai, 15, is being treated at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham after having a bullet removed from her spine.

Her parents and two brothers flew to Britain last month so that they could be with her.

It is understood that the Pakistani government has now offered her father Ziauddin a job at its consulate in Birmingham.

A source at the consulate said: 
‘Because of his experience as a teacher and in administrative roles in 
Pakistan it was decided he would be best placed as a counsellor or 
administrative assistant.

‘The initial contract is for a year 
and the Pakistan government will provide him with a home in Birmingham 
and a car. The government feels it has a duty of care to the family and 
the situation in Pakistan for them is very dangerous.’

Everyone in the Yousufzai family is on a tourist visa and the visas will expire around March 2013.

Birmingham Labour MP Khalid Mahmood welcomed the move saying the family would be surrounded by friends and family in Birmingham.

Malala was attacked by Taliban fighters in Mingora, the main town of Swat Valley, on October 9, as she travelled home from school.

She was struck by a bullet just above her left eye after extremists boarded her school bus - targeting her for demanding education and standing up for childrens' rights.

The bullet travelled down the side of her jaw and damaged her skull, and she was later flown to Britain for treatment.

The Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan has threatened to target Malala and members of her family, raising questions about whether it would be safe for her to return to Pakistan.
