West Ham are facing a huge battle to keep starlet Reece Oxford after Chelsea joined the race to land the teenage defender.

The 15-year-old is viewed as one of the Hammers' best emerging talents and has been likened to former academy graduate Rio Ferdinand.

Sportsmail revealed earlier this month that Arsenal are chasing the central defender.

And Chelsea are the latest club to be alerted to Oxford's talents and are ready to battle it out with their top-flight rivals to land the teenager.

The Hammers have high hopes for Oxford and are desperate to keep hold of the centre-back.Â  They could look to fast-track him into the first-team fold as a way of retaining him.

The England Under-16 international has already trained with the club's first-team and can expect more opportunities like that at Upton Park next season.

The dominant, ball-playing defender is already 6ft 3ins and still growing - an obvious attraction for Arsenal and Chelsea.

Despite being 15, he has already turned out for West Ham's Under-18's side, as well as their U15 and U16's but the east Long club will will be determined to keep their talented youngster.
