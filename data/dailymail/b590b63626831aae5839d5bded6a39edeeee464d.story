George Jacobs, who was Frank Sinatra's valet and confidant for 15 years, has died.

Jacobs' son, Snake Jagger, says his father died of natural causes in Palm Springs Saturday night. He was 87.

Jacobs was working for Hollywood dealmaker Irving 'Swifty' Lazar in 1953 when Sinatra hired and entrusted him with his personal affairs.

Mr S: Jacobs (pictured with Sinatra) was the valet and confidant of Frank Sinatra between 1953 and 1968

Jacobs' 2003 book, 'Mr. S: My Life with Frank Sinatra,' gives an insider's look into the crooner's life, his women and his dealings with the Kennedys, the Rat Pack and the mob.

Jacobs said he was fired after the gossip columns reported about him dancing at a nightclub with Sinatra's then-wife, Mia Farrow.

His book begins, 'Summer 1968. The only man in America who was less interested than me in sleeping with Mia Farrow was her husband and my boss, Frank Sinatra.'

Rumors of an affair with Farrow caused Sinatra to cut Jacobs off after 15 years in his service.

It's a fascinating insight into the 
life and times of the Chairman of the Board that dishes on Sinatra's 
first wife Ava Gardner, who had a drinking problem, JFK whose ambition 
was 'to f*** every actress in Hollywood,' Marilyn Monroe's lack of 
personal hygiene, and of course, Ol' Blue Eyes himself.

When
 a gossip columnist reported that Jacobs was dancing with Sinatra's 
much-younger wife Mia Farrow - whom he was in the process of divorcing -
 Sinatra's wrath was quick and decisive.

He fired Jacobs within 24 hours.

It would be 10 years before Jacobs clapped eyes on his former boss again.

The New York Times interviewed Jacobs when his memoir was released in 2003.

Of
 the meeting, he said, 'It's hard to talk about it. I took one look at 
him and broke down into tears. I couldn't stop crying. Mr. S put his arm
 around me. "Forget about it, kid," he said. "It isn't so bad."' And 
although Jacobs kept crying, Sinatra left.

'It was such a shock, it tore me apart. You have to understand, I spent 24 hours a day with him. I washed his underwear by hand on the road, I carried everything to take care of him, and it ended in such a miserable way. The way it was supposed to be, I guess. That was his way,' he said.

Two of his marriages ended while he worked 24 hours a day for Sinatra.

After Sinatra fired him, Jacobs worked for Steve McQueen, George Hamilton and Bill Cosby, but he never lived in with any employer again.

He took off for Europe and traveled for three years, then returned and got into show business himself, briefly, appearing on The Dating Game and The Gong Show.Â 

Jacobs eventually took up carpentry and moved to Van Nys, California.

He married and divorced a third time and has eight children, three of whom precede him in death.

When Sinatra died in 1998, Jacobs was cut from the funeral guest list by his third wife Barbara Marx.

Despite Ol' Blue Eyes' temper tantrums, Jacobs wrote that his boss treated him well.
