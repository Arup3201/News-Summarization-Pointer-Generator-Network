He has entertained everyone from  Jay-Z and Coldplay’s Chris Martin to the Prince of Wales. But today, TV magician Dynamo is giving a less starry but no less special  private performance at a London hotel to seven-year-old Jack  Johnstone and his parents.

Best known for ‘walking on water’ across the Thames in 2011, Dynamo is here as an ambassador for Rays Of Sunshine, a charity that grants wishes to seriously ill children.

He has surprised his young fan Jack – who has cystic fibrosis, an incurable genetic disease that affects the  respiratory and digestive systems – with a visit.

Tricking pain: Street magician Dynamo, real name Steven Frayne, began to display the first signs of Chron's disease at the age of 13

At one point, the 30-year-old entertainer holds a 10p piece – donated by Jack’s father Kevin – in the palm of his upturned hand and hovers his other hand about 12in over it. In a split-second, the coin appears to levitate and then disappears. We stare in disbelief as the magician points to a table a few feet away, where the coin now is.

‘Wooooah!’ exclaims Jack. Over the next 30 minutes, Dynamo reads Jack’s mind, turns Lottery tickets into wads of cash and makes playing cards appear out of nowhere.

Jack is spellbound by the  performance, and clearly rather starstruck – and I don’t blame him. Spooky is the best word to describe the whole experience.

Rays Of Sunshine is a cause close to Dynamo’s heart, because he knows what it’s like to be in Jack’s shoes: he has suffered from the incurable digestive condition Crohn’s disease since childhood, which meant long stretches in hospital or at home recovering from bouts of illness or surgery.

‘Being really unwell when you’re young can be very isolating, not to mention boring,’ says Dynamo,  real name Steven Frayne.

His own problems began aged 13 when all his friends seemed to experience a growth spurt but  he stayed the same size. Even now he is just 5ft 6in and weighs only 8st.

Giving back: Magician Dynamo performs card tricks to entertain fan Jack who has cystic fibrosis

‘I remember feeling like a  laboratory experiment because I had to undergo all of these tests and no one could work out what was wrong with me,’ he says. ‘It’s an age when your confidence is  knocked and it was hard being the odd one out. Finally, when I was 15, they discovered I had Crohn’s.’

It was learning magic that helped him through those tough times and he says performing  tricks kept the bullies at bay.

Crohn’s is a chronic condition which causes the lining of the digestive system to become inflamed and flare-ups are usually in the small or large intestine.Symptoms include diarrhoea, pain, fatigue and weight loss and, in the long term, the inflammation can result in additional complications, such as narrowing of the colon.

It isn’t fully understood what causes it but genes, a faulty immune system and previous infection may play a role.

There is no cure but there are medications to help control symptoms. In up to 75 per cent of cases, surgery will be needed to repair damaged parts of the digestive system.

Dynamo underwent surgery to remove half of his stomach, due to a burst abscess, aged 19. The operation was a success but he endured months of painful recovery. He has spent a total of two years in hospital since being  diagnosed, yet now has the condition under control, without medication, by eliminating foods that aggravate the condition.

Crippling: Steven Frayne is in constant pain and as a result of his illness is forced to avoid many foods considered 'healthy' which makes him ill

‘I was on 23 tablets a day and although some of the pain went, I’d have horrible side-effects,’ he says. ‘They would make me feel sleepy and spaced out which isn’t ideal when you’re a magician and you need to be on the ball for tricks to work.

‘Instead, I’ve cut out all the “healthy” foods that actually make me ill – fruits, vegetables, anything fibrous –  because they’re hard to digest. Now I live off chicken, mashed potato and pasta and have vitamin injections to make up for what my body is missing. Having Crohn’s means I can’t absorb Vitamin B12 so it’s important I get that, too.’

Although Dynamo is always in pain – likening the sensation to rubbing dirt in an open wound – he is upbeat.

‘My stomach constantly throbs but I’m used to it now,’ he says. ‘When you’re busy you learn to ignore it, especially when you’re entertaining people.’

And young Jack is certainly being entertained today. Cystic fibrosis affects about 9,000  Britons and causes the lungs and digestive system to become clogged up with thick mucous.

‘He’s a strong little boy, despite what he has to go through on a daily basis,’ says his mother Tina, 38, a healthcare manager from Preston. ‘He has to do physiotherapy twice a day to keep his lungs clear and take so many drugs.’

Jack’s condition rapidly declined last year, when his parents were told by doctors his lung function had declined to that of a 25-year-old CF suffer. The average life expectancy of a CF sufferer is 30.

‘Jack being able to meet one of his heroes is a big deal for us,’ says Kevin, 33, who works for Care UK. ‘He’s been through a lot, so to see him so happy is priceless.’
