A pet owner has won big in the Lotto - and has his best friend to thank for the multi million dollar scoop.

Bill Kelly, 58, of Ocoee, Florida, claimed a $3 million prize from the $600million GOLD RUSH Scratch-Off game at Florida Lottery headquarters in Tallahassee on Friday.

Mr Kelly bought three scratch cards, at $20 each, to put in his family's Christmas stockings in late December.

He also placed one of the tickets in his beloved dog's stocking as part of a time-honored, festive family tradition.

The new millionaire said on Friday: 'Giving Florida Lottery Scratch-Off tickets as Christmas gifts is one of my holiday traditions.

'I always hope to at least win my money back and I play to win, but I never expected this.'

Mr Kelly took a one-time payout of $2.35million on the ticket which he bought at Publix supermarket in Ocoee. 

The Florida Lottery made another millionaire last week after Fay Blake, 62, of Orlando, won $5 million in the Mega Millions draw.
