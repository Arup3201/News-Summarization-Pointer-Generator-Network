He's just been named Britain's most mischievous toddler.

And two-year-old Sonny Greer - also known as the 'wall scrawler' - has certainly earned his title.

His mother Karla, 29, from Barton-le-Clay, Bedfordshire, entered a picture of Sonny's black marker handiwork to a competition looking for the naughtiest tot in the UK.

The little two-year-old loves using permanent marker to decorate the walls, furniture - and himself

The image demonstrates the boy's ability to  make a 'complete mess' of Karla's bedroom, scribbling all over the walls and bedding in permanent black marker pen - as well as drawing all over himself.

Customer services manager Karla, said she took the photo just minutes after waking up and finding her son had 're-decorated her room' while she was relaxing.

She said Sonny created the 'disaster zone' after she put him in her own bed when he woke up crying in the middle of the night.

But as Karla dozed, the cheeky toddler got out of bed and found the marker pen in his mother's bedside drawer before getting to work.

When Karla woke up she found her son sitting on the bed looking 'like butter wouldn't melt' - with the bedroom covered in black ink.

Mother-of-one Karla said: 'It was 8pm and Sonny wasn't going to sleep, so I went up to comfort him.

'I fell asleep and woke up an hour later to find him awake and covered in permanent marker.

'He'd found it in my bedside drawer and proceeded to create a masterpiece all over himself, my bed and my walls.'

She added: 'The amazing thing is he didn't draw on me - he obviously thought I would tell him off for that. I was literally speechless, I couldn't decide whether to cry or scream.'

The entry narrowly beat one showing three kids  covered in foam after squeezing a bottle of washing up liquid into their jacuzzi - which only just lost out as the kids are not officially toddlers.

While Karla appreciates that Sonny is 'very artistic' - his hobby costs her dearly in 'little accidents'

Karla said she was going to re-decorate the wall 'when she has the time', but that she had to throw away the bedsheet - which she said was 'ruined'.

She said Sonny was 'very artistic' and loves drawing at nursery, but that he costs her hundreds of pounds a year in 'little accidents'.

Among the 'accidents' include dropping her smartphone in his 'full potty' and then hurling his mum's replacement phone into the bath just weeks later - as well as clambering into the washing machine and painting the floor with yogurt.

After being awarded the top prize for Britain's most mischievous toddler by organisers Time4Sleep, an online bed retailer, she said: 'I can't say I'm surprised he was voted Britain's most mischievous toddler - he certainly keeps me entertained on a daily basis.

Karla said: 'When my cousin told me about the competition I knew exactly which picture to send in.

'I remember showing people at the time and the reaction was priceless.'

Karla and Sonny, who is three in May, can now choose a family day out of their choice in the UK.

2. JACUZZI FILLED WITH WASHING UP LIQUID: Iris, six, and five-year-old twins Honor and Edie squirted a bottle of washing up liquid into the jacuzzi at the family home in Thirsk, North Yorkshire.

Mum Dianne Kinghorn, who submitted the photo, said: 'Has anyone seen the washing up liquid?'

3. CHOCCY MESS: Twins Matthew and Ethan Griffiths, who were nearly two when the photo was taken, are shown covered in chocolate after splattering it around the kitchen table.

Mum Hollie and Dad Chris sent in the snap at their home on the Isle of Wight accompanied by the caption 'That Chocolate Picture', with Hollie adding: 'I literally popped upstairs to get something and came down to this - the chocolate pudding was everywhere...and as the picture shows my cheeky monkeys were quite surprised when mummy told them off!'

4. DOWN THE LOO: Jayden Richardson, 20 months, was photographed by mum Jemma after he fell down the loo at his home in Bournemouth. Mum Jemma, who sent in the photo, said he told her 'I just wanted another bath mummy'.

5. BED WRECKER: Fabio, two, wrecked his bed after telling mum Lisa Bennett he wanted a 'bigger bed' like his elder brother. Lisa, of Corfe Mullen in Dorset, - who sent in the photo - said: 'My toddler took his bed apart and trashed his room every morning until he got a big boy bed like his big brother.'

As voted for by members of the public and judges at Time4Sleep

A poll by of 1,000 parents for Time4Sleep found that carpets, walls and chairs were the most damaged household items by kids and that most were caused by spillages and drawing.

It found that little girls were the messiest, with 56 per cent saying their daughters were the most trouble.

A total of 22 per cent of those parents quizzed said they spent up to five hours a week cleaning up after their toddler - with five per cent saying they ended up forking out more than £1,000-a-year to repair the damage.

A spokesperson said: 'We had an incredible response to our search for the most mischievous toddler, with almost 200 entries.

'From tots down the toilet to painting the dog, we all had our favourites, but Sonny's handiwork was a clear winner.

'Household items often bear the brunt of young children when they're in the mood for mischief, so we wanted to find out just how much they're costing mum and dad in time and money.

'The amount of time parents are spending on repairing damage is surprising, but we're sure it doesn't take long to forgive some of those angelic faces'
