A young father who went missing with his baby son taunted police on Facebook yesterday - telling them to 'go look for some killers', as officers continue their search for the pair.

Kieran Carroll, 22, of Luton, Bedfordshire, was reported missing at around midday on Tuesday along with his eight-month-old son Louis.

Yesterday afternoon, police searching for Mr Carroll released CCTV footage showing him pushing a pram as he left a hotel in the town at about 2pm. He has not been seen since.

Taunt: This comment, posted in response to a police appeal, is believed to have come from one of three accounts belonging to Mr Carroll. Police said they are now trying to verify the message

In response: Detective Inspector Sean Quinn replied to the Facebook post this afternoon (as seen above)

When the image was shared on Facebook by Bedfordshire Police yesterday afternoon, a profile understood to belong to Mr Carroll posted: 'I’m fine, so is my child - go look for some killers'.

The force also published a photo of Louis on Facebook, along with new details on the search. The taunting response came from one of three accounts believed to belong to Mr Carroll, police said.

Later last night, the same 'Kieran Carroll' profile commented again, saying, 'If any one is commenting and don't no me or what's really going on... stay out of my life you don't no me.'

It is understood that Mr Carroll attended Bedford College, Bedfordshire, and lives with his girlfriend, Louis' mother, at a home in Luton.

The 20-year-old woman is believed to have a three-year-old son from a previous relationship.

Concerns: Bedfordshire Police also released this photograph of baby Louis, whom they are trying to trace

Police are now trying to verify the Facebook comments believed to have been posted by Mr Carroll. 

A spokesman added that police still want to see the baby and father in person to check they are safe.  

She said: 'We are looking into the message and we are urging him to get in touch with us directly and not just through Facebook.  

The baby's great-grandmother today appealed for Mr Carroll to bring Louis back home safely.

Vivien Jakob-Grant, 65, told ITV Anglia: 'I would rather Louis be back home where he should be. I want him to be back home in one piece.

'I don't think his father would have hurt him because he doesn't look the kind of person who would do that - but I want him to be back home.

'I would just like him to take Louis back home where he should be.'

'We need to see him and more importantly we need to see the baby to know that they are both okay.' 

Detective Inspector Sean Quinn replied to the Facebook post this afternoon, saying: 'Kieran – Thank you for posting on our Facebook page.

‘We are pleased to hear that you and Louis are safe. It is not the role of the police to decide on child custody matters.

‘All we need to do is see you and Louis in person to check you are safe and well. Please call us on 101 so we can arrange to meet you. We cannot close this case until we see you.' 

Another commenter on the Facebook page, Chantelle Louise White, said: ‘You lot make out that he ant fine I know him for years and he won't do nuttin to he's son… He's looked after my son when he was the sane age! [sic]’ 

And Mr Carroll's sister, Alix Carroll, 24, said: 'My brother is an amazing father - he has his boy more than the mother does. 

'He's scared he's going to lose him - it's no different to if it was the other way round.

'Never in a million years would he harm a hair on his body. He will be safe - I bet my life on it.'

Search: Fears are growing because police say the disappearance of Mr Carroll (above) is ‘completely out of character’, and because they believe he does not have any supplies for the baby

Posting on Facebook, she added that she didn't know where her brother was, but that 'Louie is safe and there both okay [sic].'  

Earlier, police described the father’s disappearance as ‘completely out of character’ and said there are concerns because they believe Mr Carroll does not have any supplies for the baby.

A close friend of Mr Carroll tonight claimed the father and Louis were ‘safe’. 

She said he was not planning to contact police 'yet' because he does not want to lose contact with Louis.

The woman, who asked not to be named, said: ‘I just spoke to him on the phone and I heard his child giggling in the background. 

'He is just trying to do the right thing but he has done it the wrong way. I have told him that. He is trying to take back his child from his mother. 

'Kieran is doing the right thing by taking the child out of this situation and he is not going to the police just yet. I am trying to convince him but I can't force him to do it. 

'He can't bear the fact that tomorrow he won't be able to see his child again because social services will get involved.’

Mr Quinn said: 'This type of disappearance is very out of character for Kieran and we are becoming increasingly concerned. 

'We just want Kieran to contact us to let us know that him and Louis are safe. 

'If you have seen Kieran, or have any information about where he and Louis may be, please contact us immediately.'

Mr Carroll is described as a white man of medium build, with short brown hair. 

He is believed to be wearing black trousers, and a grey hooded top, a bobble hat, as seen in the CCTV image.

He also has tattoos on his arms. The security image shows Mr Carroll pushing a pram, but police said he later disposed of the pram at a friend's house and left carrying his son in his arms.

The baby boy is believed to be wearing a blue cardigan with a picture of a ship on it. Searches for the young father are concentrating on the local area around his home of Luton.

Anyone who may have seen Mr Carroll and his son, or has any information on their whereabouts, is urged to contact Mr Quinn on 101.
