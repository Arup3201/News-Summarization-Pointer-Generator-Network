One of the largest asteroids in the solar system, Vesta, has evidence of 'recent' water flowing on it, according to Nasa.

Images taken by the Dawn spacecraft, currently on its way to the dwarf planet Ceres, have revealed gulleys on the proto-planet that are just a few hundred million years old.

It indicates objects such as smaller than planets are able to have liquids on their surface - and suggests water may exist in more places than we thought in the universe.

Nasa scientists in California have revealed images showing 'recent' flowing water on the surface of Vesta. This image shows Cornelia Crater on the large asteroid Vesta. On the right is an inset image showing an example of curved gullies, indicated by the short white arrows, and a fan-shaped deposit, indicated by long white arrows

Revealed by Nasa scientists in California, the images were taken when Dawn visited Vesta from 2011 to 2013 before departing for Ceres.

Previously, asteroids like Vesta had been thought to be completely dry and incapable of having water because of their lower temperature and low pressure.

But gulleys found on the walls of one of the craters on Vesta suggest that is anything but the case.

According to the International Astronomical Union (IAU), a planet is an object that independently orbits the sun, has enough mass to be nearly spherical and has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.

This last point is why Pluto was demoted to dwarf planet status, which is defined as being an object similar to a planet, but it has not cleared its orbit.

Pluto orbits in the Kuiper Belt at the edge of the solar system, where many other objects similar or bigger to it in size exist.

One of those is Eris, which along with Pluto, Haumea, Makemake and Ceres make up the five dwarf planets in the solar system we know of to date.

An asteroid, meanwhile, is a large chunk of rock that orbits the sun but is not massive enough to have formed into a spherical shape.

Some objects have a dual designation: Ceres, for example, is sometimes referred to as both a dwarf planet and an asteroid, as it is part of the asteroid belt.

Vesta, sometimes referred to as a protoplanet, is the most massive asteroid in the solar system, if Ceres is not counted, while another asteroid called Pallas is thought to be very slightly bigger than Vesta in size.

'Nobody expected to find evidence of water on Vesta. The surface is very cold and there is no atmosphere, so any water on the surface evaporates,' said Jennifer Scully, a postgraduate researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).

'However, Vesta is proving to be a very interesting and complex planetary body.'

According to the scientists, the water appears to have flown down the gulleys a few hundred millions years ago, a short period of time compared to Vesta's overall age of 4.6 billion years.

The gullies left behind fan-shaped deposits after evaporation, seen in the image.

They are fairly narrow, on average about 100 feet (30 metres) wide.

The average length of the gullies is a little over half a mile (900 meters).

Cornelia Crater, with a width of 9 miles (15 kilometers), contains some of the best examples of the curved gullies and fan-shaped deposits.

However, Dr Scyull noted that it was unlikely Vesta had rivers like Earth, but rather localised areas of liquid.

'We're not suggesting that there was a river-like flow of water. We're suggesting a process similar to debris flows, where a small amount of water mobilizes the sandy and rocky particles into a flow,' she said.

But they ruled out the chance that the gullies were formed simply by the movement of dry material, as they share characteristics with debris flows from liquids on Earth and Mars.

The images were taken when Dawn visited Vesta from 2011 to 2013 (illustration shown). Dawn is now approaching the dwarf planet Ceres, the largest object in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. It will be captured into orbit around Ceres on 6 March 2015

This colourful composite image, revealed back in December 2013, shows the flow of material inside and outside a crater called Aelia on the giant asteroid Vesta. To the naked eye, these structures would not be seen. But here, they stand out in blue and red. The crater has a diameter of 2.7 miles (4.3 kilometers)

The leading theory to explain the source of the curved gullies is that Vesta has small, localised patches of ice in its subsurface.

No one knows the origin of this ice, but one possibility is that ice-rich bodies, such as comets, left part of their ice deep in the subsurface following impact.

A later impact would form a crater and heat up some of the ice patches, releasing water onto the walls of the crater.

Laboratory experiments performed at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, indicate that there could be enough time for curved gullies to form on Vesta before all of the water evaporated.

'The sandy and rocky particles in the flow help to slow the rate of evaporation,' Ms Scully said.

Vesta, pictured, is the most massive asteroid in the solar system, if Ceres is not counted, while another asteroid called Pallas is thought to be very slightly bigger than Vesta in size

The study has broad implications for planetary science.

'These results, and many others from the Dawn mission, show that Vesta is home to many processes that were previously thought to be exclusive to planets,' said UCLA's Christopher Russell, principal investigator for the Dawn mission.

'We look forward to uncovering even more insights and mysteries when Dawn studies Ceres.'

Dawn is currently in the spotlight because it is approaching the dwarf planet Ceres, the largest object in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.

It will be captured into orbit around Ceres on 6 March 2015, when it will hopefully reveal many interesting features on the surface.
