Conviction: Award-winning film and theatre designer Christopher Giles pleasured himself in front of a lone female rail passenger, a court heard today

An award-winning film and theatre designer pleasured himself in front of a lone female rail passenger, a court heard today.

Christopher Giles, 43, undid his trousers in front of the shocked woman while alone with her in a central London train carriage.

As he began to pleasure himself, he told the woman: 'Might as well have fun, the trains are slow today.'

The Brussels-born designer and former ballet dancer had followed the woman onto the train at Moorgate Station, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard.

Prosecutor Darren Watts said: 'She was reading a newspaper and the defendant decided to sit relatively close to her.

'The defendant said to her: "You are a very pretty lady".

'Initially the complainant ignored the defendant and continued to read the newspaper, but the defendant repeated it several times.

'Eventually she responded by saying "I know" in order to stop the defendant from talking.'

Giles then moved directly opposite the woman, undid his trousers and began to pleasure himself, the court heard.

'The complainant clearly saw the defendant's penis', said Mr Watts.

'He then said to her: "Might as well have fun, the trains are slow today". 

'The complainant felt disgusted and immediately feared for her safety as there was no one else in the carriage.'

The woman was afraid to flee the 
train immediately after the incident at 9.30am, for fear that Giles 
would follow her, but she managed to move to an adjacent carriage.

She got off the train at Hornsey and alerted station staff to the incident.

Giles was arrested on January 15 this year for the offence after being spotted by train staff who had been given a description of him.

He was described in court as a freelance theatre designer and the father of two grown-up children who is currently in a relationship.

Giles was the principal dancer with the Leeds-based Northern Ballet Theatre for 11 years, between 1993 and 2004, before moving behind the scenes as a production designer.

He continued to work in ballet circles as a set and costume designer, receiving training at the Royal Opera House while adding an impressive list of shows to his CV.

His 2010 credits include set design for a production of Genoveva at the Bloomsbury Theatre, and set and costumes for Bells are Ringing at the Union Theatre in Southwark. 

At the 2010 Barcelona International Film Festival, Giles scooped an award for Best Art Direction for his work on short film 'Beware Of What You Wish For'.

Giles, wearing a purple tartan jacket in the dock, told the court he regretted the incident, which took place on December 18 last year,  and described it as 'misguided flirting'.

District Judge Sally Fudge handed Giles a fine as he has no previous convictions or cautions for similar offences.

'People should be allowed to expect to travel without disturbances on public transport', she told him.

'Whatever possessed you to behave this way on that morning, I hope it never happens again.

'It must have been very upsetting for the young lady.

'It is not right to behave that way, whatever was going through your head.'

He was ordered to pay a £350 fine and a £35 victim surcharge. 

Giles, of Mitcham, Surrey, admitted outraging public decency.
