Veteran Great Escape actor Tom Adams has passed away at the age of 76.

The performer, who also starred in television shows including General Hospital and The Onedin Line, died on Thursday after battling cancer, his agent confirmed.

With a voice described as 'rich and chocolatey' he also worked as a voice-over artist, including adverts, and was a long-running voice of E4, Emma Harvey said.

'A true gentleman and a class act, his personality was as big and warm as his wonderful voice,' she added. 'We'll miss him very much.'

Adams, who lived in Windsor, was a young actor when he landed the role of Dai Nimmo, the RAF officer in charge of diversions in The Great Escape.

The 1963 cult classic Second World War drama about a mass breakout from a prisoner of war camp saw him star opposite acting greats Steve McQueen, Richard Attenborough and James Garner.

Adams later went on to have feature roles as Guy Marshall in 1960s medical drama Emergency-Ward 10 and Dr Guy Wallman in General Hospital between 1975 and 1978. Later he played Sir Daniel Fogarty in period drama The Onedin Line between 1977 and 1980.

He died at Slough's Wexham Park Hospital.

His friend, director Kate Wilson, said Adams had continued working, including advert voice-overs and a new play they had been working on just a few weeks ago.

Mrs Wilson paid tribute to him, fondly recalling times when he would come to stay with her and her husband.

'Ahhh, the chocolate of his voice sliding down the stairs...the man was a legend,' she said.

'For anyone who knew him, his face, voice and presence will be sorely missed. Handsome to the end.'
