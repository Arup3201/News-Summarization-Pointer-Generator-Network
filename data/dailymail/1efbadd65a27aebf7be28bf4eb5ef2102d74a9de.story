Collapse: Lieutenant Colonel Michael McErlain, 45, died 
during a D-Day run on the clifftops of the Normandy beaches in France

An army surgeon, who treated injured children in Afghanistan, died while competing in a charity D-Day run along the Normandy beaches in France.

Lieutenant Colonel Michael McErlain, 45, was one of around 30 runners and was bringing up the rear when he collapsed around two miles into the 44-mile race.

Another competitor, an American fireman, tried desperately to revive him but he died at the scene on the morning of June 6.

The father-of-three, who worked as a spinal surgeon at Frimley Park Hospital, Surrey, had co-founded the event with wife Joanna and brother-in-law Giles Barnes and had competed in it six times before.

Mr Barnes, who was also competing, heard about the collapse and ran four miles to the scene but arrived to find Lt Col McErlain grey and cold. He had died about 20 minutes previously.

The event, held in aid of the British Limbless ex-Services Men's Association, aims to raise awareness of the sacrifices made by allied soldiers in World War Two.

A post-mortem examination revealed Lt Col McErlain, from Hindhead, Surrey, died from ischemic heart disease.

At an inquest into the death held in Alton, Hampshire, Mr Barnes described his brother-in-law as an extremely talented man who was very 'humble' about his achievements in life.

Recalling the day he died he said: 'It was about 16 degrees outside. A lovely temperature to be doing it. It was perfect conditions.

'I was going to be doing the support part of the run. Every seven miles giving them painkillers, something to eat and drink and be on their way.

'Mike was used to doing the run. He was the slowest person on the run, but made a point of being the slowest so he could literally bring up the rear.

'I would imagine he was not even running. More of a shuffle. Certainly the runner who was with him was more interested in sightseeing and taking photographs.

'He was American and with Mike when he collapsed. They were stop starting. They had been having a conversation about the beautiful weather.

'Some of Mike's last words were that he said it was such a historically wonderful thing to do and the setting of the run itself would be enough to get people to do it.

'It was such a beautiful run. To have that conversation suggests it he wasn't really going for it.

'He did not complain about having to stop and was chatting away and suddenly he collapsed.'

The fireman, known as Brian from Colorado, said Michael was gasping for breath and lost consciousness.

Despite his best efforts to perform CPR he died in his arms during the race aimed at raising awareness of the sacrifices made by allied soldiers.

Recording a verdict of natural death, Hampshire Coroner Andrew Bradley said: 'I would expect this disease in the heart of a 65-year-old, not someone who is 45. 'If your heart is going downhill and you use it more the worse it is going to get.

'This is a degeneration and progressive change.

'He had constant medical check ups with the Army, which showed he was fine.

'It is clearly an ongoing condition. It was not a heart attack this was a degeneration rather than a single event.

'It is sad and very unexpected.'
