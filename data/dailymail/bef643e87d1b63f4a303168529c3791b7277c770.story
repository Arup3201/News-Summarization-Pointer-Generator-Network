The passport chaos threatening to ruin thousands of family holidays has got worse over the past month - despite a raft of emergency measures introduced by the Government to tackle the backlog of applications. 

Passport Office chief Paul Pugh told MPs this afternoon that the number of applications in the backlog had soared by 25,000 to 508,000 since June. 

But Mr Pugh, appearing before the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, insisted his staff were getting on top of the problem. He added: 'The Passport Office is not in chaos.'

He also revealed that despite the growing chaos, the Passport Office was in line to make a £50million 'surplus' this year.

Pictures leaked to MailOnline, showing hundreds of boxes of applications piled on the floor of a Passport Office in Liverpool, piled pressure on the Government to introduce emergency measures to tackle the backlog

The images showed boxes of applications piled in a spare room set aside for interviews. Officials at the Liverpool clearing house where the image was taken said the situation was 'a million times worse' in Durham

Mr Pugh, who earns more than £100,000 a year, said there were 483,000 applications waiting to be processed on June 1. But by June 22 the figure had grown to 537,663. He said the number had since dropped to 508,000.

Chair of the committee Keith Vaz said: 'Work in progress is going up. The number of passports issued is going down.'

Mr Pugh accepted the number of applications waiting to be processed had increased since he last appeared in Parliament, but said: 'We are doing our best to meet urgent travel needs for our customers.' 

The Passport Office chief last month told MPs that of the 483,000 applications waiting to be processed, around 55,000 would not be sent out on time.

Mr Pugh was challenged over the soaring amount of money being spent on overtime to clear the backlog.

Labour MP Paul Flynn said the Passport Office was on course to spend £5million this year on overtime. He said: 'The level of overtime has doubled. Surely that's freakish?'

Mr Pugh said: 'I would not disagree with your description of it being a freakish level of overtime.'

The exchange came after MailOnline revealed staff at the Passport Office had clocked up nearly a million pounds worth of overtime in May.

After extra staff were drafted in to deal with crisis - with some working seven days a week - overtime costs hit £964,742  in May, Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said.

The revelation, which will infuriate the thousands of families who face missing their holidays this year, came after the Home Secretary Theresa May was forced to apologise for the chaos.

The Passport Office said it has been dealing with the highest demand in 12 years, with a surge  in applications catching it by surprise.

Those who desperately need travel documents have been told that they can get their applications fast-tracked free of charge, instead of paying an extra £55.50 a person.

But this will only apply to those who have not had their passports back within three weeks and are going abroad in the next seven days.

Minister have also announced that those renewing their UK passports from overseas will be given an automatic 12-month extension.

Standard passports cost £72.50 - or £46 for children - and should only take three weeks to get.

Those needing a passport urgently can pay extra for a premium or fast-track service.

The 'premium' service, costing £128, means passports can be collected within four hours of being approved.

Under the fast-track service, costing £103, a passport is returned within a week of the application being approved.

The Home Office has urged those who have already applied not to resubmit their application.

But those that need to leave the country within the next seven days and have been waiting for their passport for more than three weeks can have their application fast tracked for free.

British families abroad can get an automatic 12 months extension - while their children will be given emergency travel documents.

And families applying from abroad for passports on behalf of their children will be given emergency travel documents as well, the Home Secretary has announced.

But it emerged  that nearly three quarters of countries will not accept the 12 month emergency extensions.

Only 50 countries have confirmed they will accept the extended passports. Popular travel spots including Australia, China, India and World Cup host country Brazil are excluded from the list that was published on the Government website 'gov.uk'.

The USA, Cyprus and Turkey – which were last year on the list of the seven most popular overseas holiday destinations for Brits – are not allowing the emergency passports.

The Passport Office has increased the number of examiners and call centre staff by a further 200 on top of the 1,000 staff already redeployed to deal with a surge in applications running at a 12-year high.

The Government's attempt to head off the growing crisis came after MailOnline published pictures showing hundreds of boxes of passport applications piled on a sorting office floor.

Passport office workers have also been forced to speak out over the pressure they are being put under to clear the backlog.

One whistleblower said workers were being left 'suicidal'. He said Mrs May did not have 'any idea' how bad the situation really was and claimed staff were at breaking point.

Speaking anonymously, he said he had been working seven days a week for four months to clear the 500,0000 backlog of applications.

He said: 'We're tired, we can't concentrate. Theresa May hasn't got any idea. She doesn't now how bad things are.'

The whistleblower was asked about the morale at the Passport Office. The worker said: 'It's suicidal. Suicidal. The staff are worn out.

'Management keep changing the goal posts. They come up with crazy ideas and say how can we help, but they don't have a clue.

'The overnight staff are only supposed to work until 9pm, but they are working till midnight. I'm just so tired.

'I just want people to know the truth. I'm worn out, really worn out and it's been going on for far too long.'

He added that the Passport Office in Durham was 'a million times worse' than in Liverpool. He added: 'It's really bad - they are way behind.'

The worker said that yesterday morning a woman 'burst into tears because of the pressure they're putting on us'.

 

 

Theresa May ordered hundreds of staff to move from UK Visas & Immigration to the Passport Office, as this leaked letter to MailOnline revealed, to help clear the backlog. But unions said the move would leave other areas short staffed
