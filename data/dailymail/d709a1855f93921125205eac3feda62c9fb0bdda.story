A top Premier League footballer has reportedly scooped more than £125,000 on the Lottery - but is trying to keep it a secret.

The player, who is said to be a household name who plays for a top club, won the six figure sum before Christmas according to Goal.com.

He matched five numbers and the bonus ball and is said to have collected his cheque this week - no doubt a drop in the ocean compared to his top flight salary.

Who is the big winner? A mystery Premier League player won over £100,000 on the Lottery

But the footballer has guaranteed his anonymity thanks to a non-publicity clause offered to all winners by the National Lottery .

Ten people each won £125,942 in the December 22 draw.

A National Lottery spokesman said it would be unable to provide any details for the winner.

He said: 'Unless a winner chooses to take publicity then no details are released.

‘We are therefore unable to confirm or deny any winner rumours.’

‘He wants to keep a low profile because of the stick he’ll get’

It is not the first time that a top flight star has been linked with the Lottery, Ashley Cole and his then wife Cheryl Cole starred in an advert for the draw back in 2006, but there is no suggestion that Cole is the Premier League winner.

Players at clubs around the country are said to be speculating as to the player's identity.

It is thought the player is keen for his identity to remain secret because of the abuse he will get from opposition fans.
