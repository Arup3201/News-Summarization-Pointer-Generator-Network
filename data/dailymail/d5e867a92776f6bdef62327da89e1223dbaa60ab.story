The New Jersey heart doctor who blew nearly $150,000 at a pricey Manhattan strip club - and then refused to pay his bill after claiming he was drugged by club employees - spent a good chunk of the money on tipping the dancers, including five strippers he reportedly took into a private room at one time.

'He had five girls at a time. This guy is insatiable. I can’t even count to five,' a source from the swanky jiggle-joint told the New York Daily News.

Dr. Zyad 
Kivarkis Younan, a cardiologist at Robert Wood Johnson University 
Hospital in New Jersey, has claimed that he did not authorize $135,303 
worth of charges to his American Express card at Scores New York 
because, he claims, he was 'drugged' by an employee of the club and was 
incapable of approving the charges.

The famed strip club has since filed a lawsuit against the doctor in Manhattan Supreme Court.

According
 to the lawsuit, Scores claims Younan 'contested the charges alleging 
that he was drugged by plaintiff’s employees and thus did not authorize 
the charges and/or he was not at plaintiff’s place of business on the 
aforesaid dates.'

The club, however, says it has Younan on video at the club four times over a 10-day period in November.

'He seemed to be very happy. He was a big tipper. He must have been happy. He came back three times,' the source continued. 'We aim to please but we need to be paid for it.'

The
 source went on to say that the club made sure that Younan had the money
 to pay his bill before issuing him tens of thousands of dollars on 
'Diamond Dollars,' in-house money that can be used to tip the dancers.

Despite Younan's claims that he wasn't at the club on the nights the charges were made to his credit card, the club says it has him on video at the club on each of the nights his card was charged, and that 'he spent most of his money on girls.'

The lawsuit alleges Younan 'voluntarily came to plaintiff’s place of business and requested that plaintiff provide him with food, beverages and services.'

Club 
manager Stephen Hyman told the paper that it's not unusual for a person 
to run up a big bill at Scores. He says, however, that it is unusual 
when someone doesn't pay.

'We get a lot of very wealthy people here. You can run up a bill,' he said.

Just
 to get in the door at Scores will cost you $20. Bottles of champagne 
can sometimes cost more than $1,000. A meal at the club, the paper 
reports, will easily run you $250, and guests are allowed to leave tips 
for the dancers on their credit cards. 

'We charge reasonable — for us — prices for liquor. We don’t cater to beer drinkers,' Hyman said.

As for Younan's claim that he was incapacitated when he was at the club, Hyman says, 'he was coherent until he saw the bill - or his wife saw the bill.'

Younan is not married.

Scores representative Steven Sabbeth told the NY Post 'This happens every once in a while, people get out of control with their credit cards, and then they wake up the next morning and realize what they’ve done.'

'They knew it the night before, but I guess it didn’t bother them because they were enjoying themselves.'
