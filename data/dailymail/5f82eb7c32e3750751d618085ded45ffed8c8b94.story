The chairman of the social mobility and child poverty commission will call for priority to be given to low-income families concerning admissions 

Schools should help poorer children jump the queue for places to break the middle-class stranglehold over admissions, according to a report fronted by the Coalition's social mobility tsar.

Former Labour health secretary Alan Milburn, chairman of the social mobility and child poverty commission, will call for priority to be given to low-income families.

In the report, Mr Milburn will criticise so-called 'selection by mortgage', where families can improve their chance of getting into a popular school by buying a home in the catchment area, saying the best schools should 'not just be for those who can afford to live nearby'.

And he will urge schools to take advantage of new powers designed to prioritise children eligible for pupil premium funding – those who could have claimed free school meals at any point over the last six years.

Academies and free schools can already use the new powers, and plans are underway to extend the freedom to all other state schools.

Although there is currently no legal requirement for state schools to change their entry criteria, the report urges headteachers to prove that they are 'walking the walk on admissions'. 

The document – called 'Cracking the code: how schools can improve social mobility' – also cautions against putting off disadvantaged families by insisting on expensive uniforms and complicated application forms.

It calls the extent to which disadvantaged youngsters are failing to get into top schools 'troubling', and warns schools that accepted methods of whittling down applicants – such as prioritising children in defined catchment areas or the offspring of staff members – could 'harm social mobility'.

The report goes on to say: 'Giving priority to children who receive the pupil premium represents a clear public commitment that a school is serious about tackling disadvantage and improving social mobility.

'There is considerable academic evidence that attending an outstanding school – and avoiding an inadequate school – matters much more for those from disadvantaged backgrounds than for other children.' 

Mr Milburn added: 'Some schools have cracked the code on how to improve social mobility by helping disadvantaged children excel in education. If some schools can do it, there is no excuse for others not to.'
