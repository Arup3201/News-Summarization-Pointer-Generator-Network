The military is officially changing its hairstyle policy after a petition was launched against the racially biased rules that were formerly in place.

In April, the Army received flack after issuing new appearance standards that banned most twists, dreadlocks and large cornrows - styles used predominantly by African-American women with natural hairstyles.

Department of Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced on Monday that the Pentagon 'reviewed its definition of authorized and prohibited styles, and eliminated offensive language, including the terms "matted and unkempt," from both the Army and Air Force grooming regulations,' according to Styleite.

Under the new rules, acceptable styles for members of the armed forces - of which a third are black women - have now been extended to include cornrows, twists and larger braids.

'These reviews were informed by a panel of military personnel of mixed demographics reflective of our diverse force,' Hagel wrote in a letter addressed to Congressional Black Caucus chair Rep. Marcia Fudge.

Hagel
 called for the review in late April after 16 female members of the Congressional 
Black Caucus wrote to him, complaining about the updated guidelines.

Additionally, more than 11,000 people 
signed a White House petition asking President Barack Obama, the 
commander in chief, to have the military review the regulations to allow
 for 'neat and maintained natural hairstyles.'

In their original letter, the Congressional Black Caucus wrote: 'Though we 
understand the intent of the updated regulation is to ensure uniformity 
in our military, it is seen as discriminatory rules targeting soldiers 
who are women of color with little regard to what is needed to maintain 
their natural hair.'

They also said that the guidelines 
calling hairstyles worn mostly by black women 'unkempt' and 'matted' 
show a lack of 'cultural 
sensitivity'.

'I think that it primarily targets black 
women, and I’m not in agreement with it,' Patricia Jackson-Kelley from 
the National Association of Black Military Women added to the AP. 'I don’t 
see how a woman wearing three braids in her hair, how that affects her 
ability to perform her duty in the military.'

Assessment: Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, pictured in Mexico last week, wrote back to the women to say he took the matter seriously and would be holding a review over the next three months

In a response letter, obtained by the Military Times, Hagel wrote: 'I want to assure you that, while none of
 the Army's revised grooming and appearance policies were designed or 
intended to discriminate or disparage against any service members, I 
take your concerns very seriously.'

Pentagon spokesman Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby said Hagel would have the deputy secretary of defense 'work with the service secretaries and military chiefs to review their respective policies' over the following three months.

Each service was asked to review its policy 'as they pertain to African American 
women to ensure standards are fair and respectful of our diverse force, 
while also meeting our military services' requirements', he wrote.
