With their sweeping floor-length gowns and high necklines, the stars on the Emmy Awards’ red carpet appeared surprisingly demure.

But only until they turned around ... for the most fashionable look this year was a blast of bare back.

And it worked wonders for those who exhibited it, from Downton Abbey stars Michelle Dockery and Joanne Froggatt to big Hollywood names like Claire Danes.

It was the two Downton actresses who revealed the most daring amount of back at the awards ceremony. Both were wearing gowns that cut away from their shoulders, right down to the base of their spine.

Their eye-catching expanse of bare skin saw both hailed as among the best-dressed stars, while Froggatt — modest Anna in the series — showed off an extremely toned physique.

British TV presenter Cat Deeley went for a striking pink and white dress with a deep V of back cleavage, finished off with a bow.

January Jones, known for her roles in X Men and Mad Men, wore a scarlet strapless dress that fell away at the back to show off her perfectly clear, smooth skin.

And Ms Danes managed the night’s most demure back display in a stunning red dress with a lace panel.

But while the stars may make this style look easy, flashing some back is surprisingly difficult to do well. For while breasts can be lifted, tummies tucked and legs improved by soaring stilettos, the back is far harder to artificially enhance.

For mere mortals, there is the risk of love handles, back fat and even acne. Only exceptional skin will work, matched by perfectly honed arms.

So little wonder that stars want to show off their smooth, tanned and perfectly toned backs when it is such a coveted asset. Most of them even put their hair up to give a clear view.

But the trickiest part of the backless look is actually the front. For only those with a pert bust can get away with going bra-less — which is what these dresses demand.

Ms Jones benefited from structure built into the bodice, which lifted her bust without the need for a bra. She and Ms Danes also worked the other major trend of the night: bright red. As did Christina Hendricks, whose voluptuous curves reminded fashionistas that a revealing front can be just as striking as any back.

Julia Roberts chose to stand out from the crowd in a short bejewelled skirt. Her peplum jacket and skirt neatly demonstrated that, at 46, she has no need to hide her famous legs away.
