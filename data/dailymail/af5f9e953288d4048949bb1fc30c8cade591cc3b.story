Actress Kate Bosworth is a regular on the summer music scene and her boho outfits inspire thousands of fun-loving festival goers each season.

This year at Coachella Kate confirmed that she had been working with British fashion brand Topshop on their festival collection and now we can finally steal her summer style as the range launches today.

To celebrate, Topshop have launched a rather spacey short film starring the stylish blonde and shot by her filmmmaker boyfriend Michael Polish.

'The Road to Coachella' features the 29-year-old floating around California's Mono Lake as she travelled to the Palm Springs music event earlier this year, where she showed off several of the pieces that she helped inspire. 

The Topshop design team worked with Kate to create 16 signature pieces based on her personal style, including a pair of buckled boots and a furry gillet that she wore to the three day music festival.

Kate said: 'I’ve always had a love of fashion. To gain learning experience from the
Topshop design team has been a great opportunity for me. Our intent was
to create fresh, wearable, and effortless festival pieces. I am proud 
of our work together and I adore these pieces.'

Topshop Creative Director Kate Phelan said: 'Kate and I were discussing the summer trends and how she had been one 
of our inspirations, she was here working with us on our Christmas 
project - the next day Kate came in with all these incredible images and
references and shared what her ultimate festival outfits looked like.

'It is an organic extension of Kate’s fashion sense aligned with the 
Topshop brand . We think that’s fresh and exciting.'

The Topshop 'Festival Campaign' is inspired by the attitude and energy of British festivals and centres around 'The discovery of music'.

The fashion brand will be hosting live ‘secret pop-up gigs’ all over the world, giving out invitations to random customers shopping on tablet, mobile and in store as well as a series of online competitions and clues that customers can follow to win tickets.
