It's party time! New Year's Eve is just around the corner; it's one of the biggest nights of the whole year and an occasion that calls for a really fabulous look. 

We're talking serious glamour and gorgeousness. So I've come up with something special - my NYE party look features icy silver eyes and shimmering skin.

NYE is one of the biggest nights of the year, so calls for ultimate glamour. Made In Chelsea's Binky talks you through tricky contouring and how to shimmer without looking overdone 

Get The Look

Flawless Skin

On New Year's Eve you need a full coverage base that will last the whole night, so I applied DiorSkin Star Foundation. This gives a really flawless high-definition finish, so is ideal for a big night out when you want your skin to look perfect.

If you need a bit more coverage around the eye area, simply dab on a touch of cover-up.

 I used Clarins Instant Light Brush On Perfector, which will instantly disguise any dark circles without drying out the delicate skin in that area.

 

Sparkling Eyes

I love a classic smoky eye but this time I've updated the look using icy silver tones to create a glamorous metallic version. 

First, to act as a base colour, I took the light grey shade from thebareMinerals Ready Eyeshadow Palette in The Afterparty and swept it all over my lids.  

Next, I chose the shimmery silver from the palette, sweeping it across my lids and focusing on the outer corners of the eyes. 

I followed this with the black shade, working it into my socket line and along my upper lash line to add depth to my eyes and really make the silver tone shine.

I defined both my upper and lower lash lines with Daniel Sandler Waterproof Eyeliner in Black Velvet, focusing more on the outer corners. 

Multiple coats of Dior Addict It-Lash Mascara completed my glistening party eyes.

Shimmer And Shine

A glam party look like this isn’t complete without some serious contouring, and I used bareMinerals Ready Bronzer in The Skinny Dip to sculpt my face and create the illusion of razor-sharp cheekbones. 

Simply suck your cheeks in and brush the colour under your cheekbones, as well as along your temples and across your jawline for a chiselled effect.

Next, I added some shimmer to the look with the Too Faced Candlelight Glow Highlighter. Using a small brush, I swept the champagne shade over the tops of my cheekbones, down my nose and under my brow bones. 

A shimmering highlighter like this can really transform a party look and make it extra glamorous – perfect for New Year's Eve when you want to go all out with your make up.

A Perfect Pout

Lastly, the lips. 

When I’ve created dramatic smokey eyes, I always opt for a nude lip to keep the look balanced. 

As it’s New Years Eve, I’ve chosen one with a slight shimmer to it to add to the party feel. 

I applied Daniel Sandler Lipshine in Buff to my lips straight from the bullet.

You'll find all the products I've used in this look at online beauty boutique Escentual.com.

Well, I'm party-ready and all set to have some serious fun. Enjoy your New Year’s celebrations, and I’ll see you in 2015!

Stay gorgeous
