A college student was correctly able to guess all the letters in a puzzle on the the Wheel of Fortune and would have won $1 million had it not been for his own Achilles heel - not being able to pronounce the answer correctly.

Julian Batt, a freshman at Indiana University was given more than one opportunity to win large prizes including a one million dollar prize, and even a car, but he kept flouting his fatal flaws.

At one point, an excited Batt guessed the all letters to the answer 'The Mythological Hero Achilles' but instead of pronouncing it the proper way he said 'A-chill-us.'

Julian Batt is thrilled at the opportunity to win $1 million and he even guesses all of the letters in an answer, but when it comes to reading the answers off the board, he unfortunately makes a memorable mistake

The 'Mythological Hero A-chill-us' answers Batt incorrectly and his poor pronunciation costs him $1 million

He would have won $1 million had he simply pronounced the answer correctly. Unluckily for him the incorrect answer rolled off of his tongue and the money slipped away from his grasp, reports The Daily Dot.

Later on in the game, when Batt had the opportunity to win a car, all he had to do was guess the M and the N in the phrase 'The World's Fastest Man.' Yet again, he failed.

Then he had an opportunity to solve a puzzle once more. Instead of stating the correct answer as 'on the spot decision' he said it was 'on the spot dicespin'!

Even though Julian may not be the brightest of all Wheel of Fortune players, he still managed to win with the most points during his episode of the game show.

According to Indiana University's newspaper, Julian has dreamed of going on the game show for a long time.

Next, the almost lucky contestant has the opportunity to win a car but unfortunately he fails to answer correctly again

Had Julian guessed the letter M and N, he would have won a car but unfortunately he guessed incorrectly

'"I've watched it as long as I can remember,' he said of the game show, which has been on the air for more than 30 years. 'I have always had that desire to be on the show and solve puzzles in front of a live audience,' reads the school's website.

Batt is an honors student and freshman at his University and to cut him some slack 'he was the only freshman on the show.'

When asked about the audition process Batt said, 'They were looking for people who were enthusiastic and energetic to be on the show.'

Enthusiasm is something Mr Batt is certainly not short of.
