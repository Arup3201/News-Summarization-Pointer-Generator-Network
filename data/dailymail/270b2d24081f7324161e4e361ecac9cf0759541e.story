She was found dead in a cave where she had been living in a Sydney park nearly six months ago, but  police have admitted they still have no idea who she is.

The woman was found by a member of the public  at Middle Cove in Sydney's north in February with a pillow, blanket and three plastic containers scattered around her.

Police said residents of the affluent suburb had seen the woman, believed to be homeless, walking the streets, but no one knew her name and she had not been reported missing.

A post mortem found her death was not suspicious but extensive police inquires and forensic details have so far been unable to determine her identity.

Residents who saw frequently saw the woman told police she had been living in the cave for six to seven years, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

'We've checked out most homeless refuges, she's not known to them - which to us is very odd,' Constable Andrew Schepis said.

'She's obviously the daughter of someone. Perhaps there were some family issues that caused them to become disconnected - we're unsure.'Â 

The woman had used the name of Jemima Ann King in Queensland in 2002 but they don't believe that was her real identity.

Police have released a photo of the woman taken in 2002 in a bid to track down someone who knows her identity.

They believe she lived in both NSW and Queensland.

She is described as being of Caucasian appearance, aged between 35 and 50 years, 155 to 160cm tall, thin build and brown hair with yellow streaks.

Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
