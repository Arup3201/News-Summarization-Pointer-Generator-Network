They thronged Wheldon Road in their thousands, adorned in replica shirts and scarves, waving flags as the Tigers emerged from The Jungle for their historic journey south. It was a fittingly raucous send-off.

Castleford haven’t been to Wembley for 22 years, so when the coach carrying players and staff left their ground on Thursday, it was as if half of the West Yorkshire town had come along to wave them on their way. They crawled through the crowds before heading for the M1 and London.

Challenge Cup fever was plain to see ahead of Saturday’s clash with big-city neighbours Leeds. The British sporting staple of haves versus have-nots had captured the imagination of the public. These Tigers may go into the showpiece fixture as underdogs, but they will have close to 25,000 fans urging them to upset the odds at the home of English football.

Half a mile from The Jungle, all along Carlton Street, stalls had been set up to sell ‘Cas’ merchandise, with traders converging from around the country. There were T-shirts announcing the ‘Wembley invasion 2014’.

An opticians had mannequins dressed in team shirts, the indoor market had a ‘Tigers fun day’ in full swing and a bank had stickers in the windows. Cafes and houses were decorated with black and gold bunting. Anticipation was tangible. At the official club shop, they had run out of Castleford kits for the first time ever — with the white away shirt selling well as it is the one the players will wear today, as their triumphant predecessors did in 1969-70.

Reaching this final is worth £300,000 to the Tigers and victory would bring a further £70,000, along with prestige, enhanced ticket sales, profile and interest.

But that is merely a small part of the story. A club and a town forced to endure tough times in recent years have cause for renewed optimism. Steve Gill  took over as chief executive last year and the plight of the Tigers left him struggling with depression before an upturn in fortunes on and off the field this season.

Castleford (from): Dixon, Shenton (capt), Webster, Carney, Dorn, Sneyd, Lynch, Milner, Huby, Hauraki, Massey, Clark, Holmes, Mariano, Wheeldon, Ellis, Finn, Jewitt, Carvell.

Venue: Wembley Stadium  

Today is when the revival becomes real. ‘We’ve had some big games when we’ve won promotion back into Super League — in 2005 and 2007 — but the big one for the fans is the Wembley game,’ said Gill. ‘It is a showpiece of the sport on one of the best stages in the world. For us to get there is fantastic for the town and the club.’

Asked what the Tigers represent to the people of Castleford, Gill added: ‘This means everything to them. We were a mining town and a lot of people here lost their jobs in the industry. I was a miner, I did 22 years underground, and we were proud of our colliery — the whole town was proud of it. It meant a lot to us; to work hard and look after each other, and those values are part of the rugby club in Castleford. It is ours, it is a family and it is an integral part of the community.

The gaffer: Tigers Head Coach Daryl Powell stands next to the trophy that he hopes to lift on Saturday

‘Everything we do has an impact on the town. We make people’s lives a lot easier when we win and everyone feels it when we lose. I haven’t felt that same sense of community here since the miners went on strike in 1985. On Saturday, we’re asking the last person out of here to turn off the lights.’

Kellingley, the last colliery in the area, was recently earmarked for closure, which will once again have a negative impact on the local workforce, but for now rugby league is providing a welcome distraction. Win or lose today, the Tigers will enjoy a civic reception in Castleford on Monday, then resume their attempts to reach the Super League play-offs.

Earlier this season, coach Daryl Powell’s players agreed a self-imposed alcohol ban, as another means of committing themselves fully to the quest for a first major title since the old Regal Trophy was won in 1994.

Physical: Castleford will need to play with determination to get the better of Leeds on Saturday

On Tuesday this week, the current squad were addressed by Malcolm Reilly, the decorated coach of the successful 1986 team and a player in the fabled 1970 side.

Powell is the obvious link between the teams, as one of the Rhinos side who claimed this prize in 1999. Since then, Leeds have been to six finals and lost the lot. Captain Kevin Sinfield has been in five of those defeats. ‘We don’t have a bad record apart from the finals,’ he said. ‘We’re desperate to win. I feel very fortunate to have played at Wembley and to get another shot is really special.’

There can be no doubting the motivation for Leeds, but for Castleford the long wait for this pilgrimage to the capital and the difficulties they have endured adds greater resonance. As the club await planning permission for a proposed new stadium, Gill said: ‘We’ve been lucky to survive, now it is our time to thrive.’
