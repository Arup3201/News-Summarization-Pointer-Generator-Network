Scott Sinclair is expecting his first child, with 24-year-old former Coronation Street actress Helen Flanagan.

The Manchester City winger's girlfriend is reportedly three months pregnant, and a source told The Sun she is 'bursting with excitement.  

The insider said: 'It's a much-wanted pregnancy which makes it all the sweeter. Helen is so thrilled. She was bursting with excitement.'

Sinclair has found game-time hard to come by since his move to the Etihad Stadium, but made a rare substitute appearance against Crystal Palace on Saturday, coming on in the 89th minute.

He has only made three appearances in all competitions this season, all of which from the bench, and only one in the Premier League.

Sinclair's girlfriend Flanagan was seen showing off her baby bump on a recent holiday in Dubai, where she sported a turquoise bikini. 

MailOnline has contacted Helen's representatives for comment.

Flanagan is well-known for her appearance on the ITV reality show, 'I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here'

After a brief split last year, Flanagan and Sinclair have reunited and are now reportedly set to become parents

While she appeared to be in high spirits in Dubai, Flanagan has admitted to being unwell recently, with friends telling The Sun that she has been experiencing bad morning sickness. 

On December 2, Helen tweeted: 'Nothing better than your mum looking after you when your feeling ill (sic).'

And just a few days earlier, she shared with her fans that she was 'poorly in bed'.  

The pair have been together for six years, although they had a brief split in 2013.

They broke up amid claims the sportsman had sent a series of saucy text messages to TV presenter Donatella Panayiotou after they met while on holiday in Cannes.

But they reunited soon afterwards and in an exclusive interview with MailOnline, Flanagan said: 'I don't think I'm ready for marriage, but I've always wanted to have children. I always feel broody, I've been broody since I was about 18! I absolutely love children, I really really do.

'I probably would do it before marriage as I feel more ready to have a baby than get married. I think it would be an absolute dream to be a mum. I would love it.'
