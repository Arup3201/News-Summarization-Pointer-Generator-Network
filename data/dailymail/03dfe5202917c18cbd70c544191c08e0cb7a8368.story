David Silva had every reason to be cheerful after scoring a double in Manchester City's convincing win against Crystal Palace on Saturday afternoon.

The Spaniard was in imperious form as the champions drew level on points with Chelsea at the top of the Premier League after the 3-0 win, ahead of the Blues' trip to Stoke on Monday night.

The 28-year-old also received two awards on the day, picking up the Barclays man of the match accolade as well as being recognised for becoming the club's all-time international appearance record holder.

Silva was handed the award by club legend Colin Bell, who held the previous record of making 48 international appearances while playing for City.

That was until the Spaniard broke that tally when he made his 49th appearance for Spain in a 4-0 win against Luxembourg in October - while scoring the opener that night too.

On his official Twitter account Silva expressed his delight at breaking the record saying: 'Proud to be the player with the most international caps while playing for Manchester City and even more special to receive the prize from the legend Colin Bell.'

The diminutive playmaker - who has been at the club for four and a half years - was also making his 200th appearance in Sky Blue colours, and is hopeful of making many more in the future.

He added: 'Happy for my 200th match for Manchester City, for the victory and for my hope to play another 200!'

As well as this Silva notched his second-ever brace for Manuel Pellegrini's side in the 3-0 win, with his first coming all the way back in January 2013 against Fulham.Â
