Natasha Gascoine, 25, said she is giving her rugby player husband Andy Powell one last chance to make their marriage work

The wife of 'scrumbag' rugby star Andy Powell has revealed she is giving the Welsh player one last chance to make their marriage work.

Natasha Gascoine, who is 16 weeks pregnant with Powell's child, branded the former British Lions player a 'liar, cheat and a scumbag' when their marriage failed in March this year after just nine months.

During the very public spat, the 25-year-old posted screengrabs of his sexually explicit texts to her on Twitter and also put her husband's rugby gear for sale on eBay.

But, in May this year, Ms Gascoine confirmed she was pregnant again - and that 32-year-old Powell was the father.

Now she says the couple - who have had an openly tempestuous relationship since they married in May last year - have one last chance to 'make it work'.

She told the Daily Mirror: 'At one point, I blamed him for losing my babies. But he is so happy about the baby and he can't wait to be a dad. I know we can make it work this time.'

She also described how her husband had changed since their break-up and something has 'clicked in his mind'.

She added: 'Andy told me wanted to make a go things and get his life back on track.

'He has been very apologetic. I don't know whether it is because I am pregnant or because something clicked in his mind.'

The pair's reunion came after they started divorce proceedings in March over Powell's alleged infidelity, 
drinking and gambling.

At the time, Ms 
Gascoine was 17 weeks pregnant. She miscarried one month later.

After that, the pair argued very publicly via Twitter - and the row even went on to include 6ft 4in Powell bizarrely posting a naked picture of himself.

Ms Gascoine also sprayed the words 'scumbag' and cheat over his house and pink 
Mercedes, and even went onto eBay to sell her £10,000 engagement ring, 
wedding ring, jewellery, dress and the gifts the pair received on the 
big day.

She wrote on the 
auction website: 'The sentimental value has gone and to be honest. Since
 being married to him I have realised how fake he really is. And what a 
great let down he has been.'

Office
 worker Ms Gascoine gave the proceeds of her clear out to Women's Aid 
and Samaritans - charities she describes as 'close to her heart'.

But today she revealed how she saw Powell's 'dark side' for the first time on the New Year's Eve - five months before they were married. 

The pair had become engaged after a whirlwind three-month relationship - but Ms Gascoine said things quickly went downhill.

She told how 'he just flipped' when 
they returned home from New Year celebrations and punched his fist into 
the wall when there was no food in the house.

Ms Gascoine branded her husband Andy Powell, pictured here playing for Wales, a 'scumbag' in March amid allegations he had cheated on her. But she says the rugby player has now turned his life around

Scorned Ms Gascoine posted this one-fingered gesture at her husband during the public spat, pictured left, which came just nine months after their luxurious wedding in May last year, pictured right

Despite her concerns, the pair went on to marry at the Celtic Manor golf resort in Newport in May, 
which was followed by a £30,000 party at a hotel in Majorca.

But that wedding was the start of several more ups and downs for the couple.

Before flying out for the big day, Ms 
Gascoine said Powell admitted he did not have any money and could not 
pay the final £11,000 bill.

He then only managed to pay it - by recouping the money on a bet, she said.

Then, the night before the 
party, Powell allegedly turned up to the hotel drunk and was almost 
restrained by Spanish police officers.

During the public spat, she posted Powell's clothes - including his wedding suit - on eBay, before donating the proceeds to charity

She also marketed the rugby player's boots on the site for just £16

Ms Gascoine told how, once married life began, it emerged Powell had a gambling problem.

It
 was only revealed when Ms Gascoine found his betting slips all over the
 flat. She told how, in the first week of August, he had spent £7,300 - 
three times his wage.

The day after Ms Gascoine was quizzed by police over the alleged car vandalism, Powell posted this bizarre picture to Twitter

After breaking up and again reconciling, the allegations of Powell's cheating emerged.

She
 said at the time: 'I don't think Andy Powell knows who he really is, 
he's built a character to fool everyone who knows him and I fell for it.

'I
 wouldn't want anyone else going through what I have been through, I've 
been holding up my wedding dress, thinking of the future we had planned -
 destroyed.'

But, after
 returning from a holiday to Dubai with a friend in May this year, Ms 
Gascoine announced she was pregnant for the fourth time in just over a 
year.

At the time, she tweeted: 'Coming back
 from Dubai & I have found out I'm pregnant for the fourth time in 
almost a year," she wrote on Twitter, posting a photograph of her 
positive pregnancy test.

'Soo
 nervous :( really wish I could be excited and calm about it. Trying not
 to build up my hopes but also to avoid thinking the worse possible 
scenario :(

'Fingers crossed
 and God's luck everything turns out ok. I got to 17 weeks last time... 6
 weeks second and very early few weeks first time. Extremely nervous :( 
xxxxx.'

Speaking about their reunion, she aaid: 'Andy was ringing me and 
texting me and I ignored it but a a few weeks after we thought: "We'll 
put everything behind us and move forward".

'He said he didn't want us to get divorced - and we still love each other, there is no doubt about that.

'It took me a while to accept because I was still really angry.

'He
 said he would do various things to make it up to me and we'd get back 
on track and see each other here and there and now I'm pregnant again.'

The pair are now living together at her parents' home in Usk, Monmouthshire while Powell has signed for the Newport Gwent Dragons.

The couple have had a tempestuous relationship but Ms Gascoine said they are now moving forward and looking forward to becoming a family

Powell played for the Cardiff Blues, Wasps and Sale Sharks during his rugby career, before crossing codes to play rugby league for the Wigan Warriors.

But his move ended after just five games for Wigan when he picked up a neck injury, and he was released by the club in January.

He won 23 caps for Wales, and toured South Africa with the British and Irish Lions in 2009.

But he was also known for his off-field problems. In 2011 was suspended after getting embroiled in a bar brawl with football fans.

In 2010 he was banned from driving for 15 months and fined £1,000 for driving the stolen cart along the hard shoulder of the M4 to 'get some munchies' from a service station at 5.30 in the morning.

MailOnline has contacted Powell's agent for comment.
