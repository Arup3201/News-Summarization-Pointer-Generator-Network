A 23-year-old National Guardsman is suspected of carrying out a murder-suicide in Logan, Utah early Monday morning.

Police believe solder Jared J Tolman broke into friend MacKenzie Madden's home on the edge of the Utah State University Campus shortly after midnight, and proceeded to shoot her dead along with her 25-year-old friend Johnathan Jacob Sadler.

Thirty minutes later, police were called to an apartment just a few blocks away where Tolman allegedly walked into the living room and turned the gun on himself.

Police say the same handgun was used in all three shootings and that they are not looking for any other suspects at the time.

Before embarking on his killing spree, Jared Tolman, 23, left a suicide note at his home in Logan in which he admitted that what he was about to do was selfish

It's still unclear the relationship between the three young people. However, police say Tolman and Madden, a former police intern, were acquainted and were texting each other just prior to the shooting. Sadler was apparently visiting Madden at her apartment on the 600 block of E 500 N St when the incident happened.

The door was broken down and both Sadler and Madden were shot several times.

It's unclear whether Madden and Sadler, both Logan residents, were the intended targets but there was no one else in the immediate vicinity of the apartment.

Witnesses also told police that they saw a car speeding off after the shots rang out.

Just thirty minutes later, police received yet another call when Tolman entered a friend's apartment and shot himself dead in the living room. He left a suicide note at his own home, though police have yet to release details of the message.  

Madden and Sadler's bodies were found in her apartment (pictured above) shortly after midnight Monday morning

The friends say Tolman did not live there, and they were in another room at the time they heard the shot ring out. The two other people in the apartment then called 911.

At the time of his death, Tolman was a member of the Utah Army National Guard, a spokesman confirmed.

He was on his initial enlistment and assigned to the 19th Special Forces Unit, General Support Battalion.

Lt Col Stephen Fairbourn said Tolman worked as a laundry and equipment handler. He was reportedly in the process of leaving the National Guard, but had not yet completed the paperwork.

Weapon: Police say the gun Tolman used was personal and not government-issued. According to his Facebook, Tolman was a gun enthusiast, with several pictures posted of him clutching firearms

'Our hearts go out to those affected,' Fairbourn told the Deseret News.

The handgun Tolman used in the shooting was personal, police said, and not government-issued.

No
 motive for the crime has been released yet. Police say there did not 
appear to be a serious relationship between the three people and that 
they don't think the shooting was domestic-related.

According
 to Madden's LinkedIn profile, the teen was studying sociology and 
psychology at Utah State, with a minor in criminal justice. Last summer 
she interned for the Logan City Police Department.
