Gerard Pique could clock up his 200th La Liga appearance on Saturday afternoon when Barcelona face Elche but he is also celebrating success off the field in his other life as a video game entrepreneur.

The player’s interactive football game Golden Manager is now number one in the App Store charts just 24 hours after its launch. 

This is the first big project for Pique’s Barcelona-based small company of 30 staff, Kerad Games, and it has been a huge success.

The game  allows players to be manager, chairman and owner of their own teams and play against friends across social media. It is played by some of the player’s Barca team-mates and by those no longer at the club such as Chelsea’s Cesc Fabregas.

The business sideline doesn’t seem to be affecting Pique on the pitch. He has been one of Barcelona’s most consistent performers this season and if he starts against Elche this afternoon it will be game number 200 in his La Liga career.

The 27-year-old made his debut in Spain on loan from Manchester United, at Zaragoza in 2006. He did well enough to convince Pep Guardiola to resign him from United for Barcelona in 2008 and he became the cornerstone of a side that won four leagues and two Champions Leagues.

Pique is currently one game from suspension and so coach Luis Enrique must decide whether or not to start with him with one eye on upcoming games against Villarreal and Athletic Bilbao.

One man who will definitely not be rested is birthday boy Luis Suarez. The former Liverpool striker is 28 today and desperate to improve his scoring ratio against the team with the worst defence in the league.

Coach Luis Enrique said in the build-up to Saturday's game: “Few strikers offer the movement that he does. It is not just about scoring goals it’s about linking play and dragging defenders out of position. I have no doubts he will also score a lot of goals."
