Mumbai City FC manager Peter Reid has explained his decision to leave Nicolas Anelka out of his side’s 3-0 defeat by Kolkata on Sunday despite the All Indian Football Federation giving the striker the all-clear.

Sportsmail revealed the AIFF were ready to allow Anelka to play in spite of his ‘quenelle’ ban as they had yet to receive confirmation from FIFA.

Anelka missed the game and his side lost 3-0 at Salt Lake stadium.

Alessandro Del Piero - Delhi Dynamos

Robert Pires - Goa

David James - Kerala Blasters

Freddie Ljungberg - Mumbai City

Joan Capdevila - NorthEast United

David Trezeguet - Pune City

Reid said: ‘The original plan was to play him and then go to FIFA (with adequate reasons as to why he was played) but we decided against that because it would put Anelka and football as a whole in a tough situation.’

Reid explained that there was ongoing communication with FIFA over the matter: ‘We are still trying to get clarification on the matter. 

'What I can tell you is that we didn’t play him because we didn’t get any official confirmation from FIFA that he could play. We’re still waiting for that.’

Anelka was given a global five-match ban for his ‘quenelle’ gesture which now stands at two as he missed two games while waiting for his West Bromwich Albion contract to terminated and Sunday's match v Kolkata.

Anelka received a global five-match ban for the 'quenelle gesture' he made against West Ham in December

However, the AIFF were prepared to let him play as FIFA has failed to respond to their appeal and calls for clarification. General secretary Kushal Das said: ‘If FIFA tells us that the ban should be served, he will sit out for the next games.’

The FA had called upon FIFA to uphold the ban and responded by stating: ‘This is now a matter for FIFA as we have ensured all correct procedures have been followed in accordance with the rules. As far as we are concerned we expect the sanction to be fully served.’

Article 12 of FIFA’s regulations on the Status and Transfer of Players specifies: ‘Any disciplinary suspension imposed on a player prior to a transfer must be enforced or applied by the new association at which the player is registered. 

'The former association is obliged to notify the new association of any sanction in writing and upon issuing the international transfer clearance (ITC).’

Meanwhile, former Crystal Palace and Bolton midfielder Andre Moritz has also joined Mumbai.
