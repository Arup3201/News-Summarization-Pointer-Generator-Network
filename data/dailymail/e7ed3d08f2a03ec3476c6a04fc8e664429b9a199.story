Popular cling film brand Glad Wrap have been forced to rework their new packaging design after a furore of public backlash from disgruntled customers

Taking to social media, over 400 frustrated Glad Wrap customers said the structural positioning of the new cutter could not withstand any amount of cutting and simply left the box and their hands in shreds. 

At the bottom of the box, instead of a jagged edge, there is now a plastic cutter for easier dispensing. however many users have said it does not work. 

'I am very annoyed that I wasted $5 on your substandard product', one Glad Wrap user said.

'I have completely lost my glad wrap mojo with the new cutter! Plus the box is getting ruined a lot quicker too.' another unsatisfied customer said. 

Another customer said she would be moving brands until the situation was resolved. 'Sorry but I've changed brands. Have been buying Glad for 25 years since moving out of home. It's so frustrating. Please change it back,' she said 

'What engineering genius came up with this flawed design? Apart from trying to cut the plastic against a movable cutting edge and ending up in a bloody, every time you go to open the lid you nearly slice your finger open,' an agitated man said.

Others, who said they would be taking their business elsewhere should the company fail to rectify the problem seem to have struck a chord with the business, as Glad have backtracked on their new design, revealing earlier today that it was 'under review'. 

'All changes were made in response to customer feedback, with the intention of improving the value and usage experience. We wanted to give our customers a much better experience and better value, at no extra cost,' a Glad Wrap representative said.

'Before making these changes, Glad completed rigorous and extensive in-home research in Australia, receiving positive feedback from Australians who participated in the research. However, we are actively listening to our loyal customer base, taking the current feedback concerning the new cutter bar location very seriously and this is currently under review.'
