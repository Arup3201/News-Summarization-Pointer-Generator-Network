Tinder is planning to unveil a new ‘undo’ button that will give users a second chance to review potential matches that they have already swiped left and rejected.

There is currently no way to contact a user on the dating app once you have chosen to dismiss their profile and swiped left to erase them from your profile forever – even if the rejection was accidental.

But now users of the popular app will have the chance to reclaim lost loves thanks to the new feature, which is being released as part of a new premium upgrade called Tinder Plus.

Giving love a second chance: Tinder is planning to unveil a new 'undo' button that will let users reconsider matches they may have accidentally rejected 

The undo button is something users have been asking for since Tinder’s launch, according to Forbes. Indeed, a quick Google search brings up multiple Reddit conversations on the necessity of such a function.

Another new perk of the premium plan is a travel feature that will let users 'jump across the country and globe, swiping through potential matches in Barcelona and Boston, Rio and Rome.'

Tinder Places, a third premium feature that could roll out at a later time, would help users meet new people based on venues they frequent, such as bars, stadiums, museums and parks.

The announcement was made by Tinder CEO Sean Rad, who just announced that he's stepping down from his post. 

The 28-year-old will remain on Tinder's board and serve as president when the new CEO is chosen by the app's majority owner, IAC.

When explaining the company's decision to launch the premium plan, Mr Rad said: 'We are adding features users have been begging us for. They will offer so much value we think users are willing to pay for them.'

He added: 'We had to get our product and growth right first. Revenue has always been on the road map.'

The app, which has become popular around the globe, sees 1.2 billion profiles swiped and almost 14 million matches made every day.

The upgrade will mean users can still use the free version, but a fee will give them access to additional features.
