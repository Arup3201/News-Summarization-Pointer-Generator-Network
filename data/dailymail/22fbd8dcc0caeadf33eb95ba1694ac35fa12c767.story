Plea deal: Andrew Demers, 74, entering a guilty plea to a felony charge of unlawful sexual contact

A former police chief sobbed as he was sentenced to four years in prison for sexually assaulting a 4-year-old relative.

Andrew Demers, 74, of New Gloucester was the former chief of Maine State Police and was one of the mostly highly decorated police officers in Maine’s history.

But  he broke down sobbing repeatedly during his sentencing hearing at the Cumberland County Courthouse on Tuesday after entering a guilty plea to a felony charge of unlawful sexual contact.

The parents of the child that he molested sat at one side of the courtroom near Cumberland County District Attorney Stephanie Anderson, who prosecuted the case. 

'He took my little girl’s innocence from us,' the child’s mother wrote in a statement:

Superior Court Justice Thomas Warren sentenced Demers to five years, with the final year to be suspended while Demers serves a three-year probation term. 

The judge also ordered him to pay $5,000 restitution to pay for past and future counseling for the child according to The Portland Press Herald.

Demers’ arrest on March 17 shocked the state’s law enforcement community, many of whom had considered him a model officer. 

He had enjoyed a 26 year career with the state police and served as chief for six years before retiring in 1993.

He was the only officer in Maine history to be twice named the state police Trooper of the Year and was named Legendary Trooper in 2003.

However, State police first received a tip about his alleged crime on March 10 and referred the matter to the district attorney, who asked the sheriff’s office to investigate.

The abuse had allegedly been taking place at Demers' house in New Gloucester for several months, according to the Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce.  

Demers pleaded guilty as part of an agreement reached by his attorney Walter McKee and Anderson in which a more serious Class A felony charge of gross sexual assault was dismissed. 

Police: Demers' was chief of Maine State Police from 1987 to 1993 and enjoyed a 26-year career until he retired

He could have faced up to 30 years on that charge. 

As the judge handed down his sentence, he rejected a claim by Demers’ clinical psychologist that Demers’ actions were out of character.

The psychologist argued that it may have been a result of neurological damage from post-traumatic stress from decades of police service.

Jail: The District Attorney’s Office arranged for Demers to turn himself in at the county jail

Warren said: 'Crimes like this come from a dark place within a person that are often buried deep within and unknown.'

Meanwhile, Demers’ attorney, Walter McKee, argued that his  client had already been punished - because his reputation was ruined.

McKee wrote: 'Andy is, by every single account, the last person that anyone ever expected would be involved in an offense like this and this alone speaks volumes about who Andy is.'

'He has lived his life in a way that is the farthest cry from behavior at issue here than one can imagine.' 

'There are also very real, significant concerns about Andy’s safety while incarcerated in the custody of the Department of Corrections. 

But the judge rejected McKee’s request that Demers be allowed to serve a lesser sentence.

He did, however, grant him  a one-week delay before beginning his sentence on Nov. 11.

The District Attorney’s Office and McKee  arranged for Demers to turn himself in at the county jail.

At his sentencing, Demers addressed the court. 

He wiped tears from his eyes with a handkerchief and said: 'Your Honor, since my arrest I have been torn and torn with shame.'
