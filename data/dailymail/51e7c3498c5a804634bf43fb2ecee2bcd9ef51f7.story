Gus Poyet feels he now has a responsibility to help Connor Wickham mature into a full England international after he finally committed his future to Sunderland.

The 21-year-old put an end to speculation that he could be set to quit the Stadium of Light in the summer after signing a new deal until 2019 earlier this week.

Wickham was just 18 when he joined the Black Cats in an £8million move from Ipswich Town. But only this season has he won a regular starting place and spent much of last year on loan in the Championship before returning to score the goals which kept the club in the Premier League.

Poyet regrets not spending more time with the forward upon his arrival on Wearside just over a year ago.

But the Uruguayan believes that Wickham’s new contract gives them both a platform from which to move forward.

‘It's important for me that Connor's signed his contract. Too many things have been out in the open,’ he said ahead of Saturday's visit of West Ham.

‘In the summer it was the aim to get him tied down but things happen. Decisions are not easy and everything needed to come together - him being happy, wanting to be here and being part of the team.

‘To be honest, not having a chat with him when I arrived was something I didn't do that I regret.

‘I'm delighted (now) because it's not easy to find players like Connor - and you never know how much he can cost. We can talk different prices but for sure we're talking about millions.’

Wickham has been capped 17 times by England Under-21s and Poyet believes progression to the senior ranks should now be his aim.

‘There are not too many young English players with that power,’ he said.

‘Maybe the people who worked with him at Under-21 would be surprised if they got the chance to see him again now.

‘They'd be surprised at how much he's improved and how mature he is. Now it depends on us making him better and him scoring goals.’

He added: ‘I forget sometimes he's 21. Because you've been with him for a while, you think he's 24. He's more mature, he knows his game better and what he can do for us. He keeps improving and there's more to come, I'm sure there's more.’

Wickham was named Football League Young Player of the Year before his move to Sunderland.

Poyet, though, feels the big-money transfer came too soon in his development.

‘I'm not going to blame anyone, but sometimes when you pay a lot of money for a player, we all think that player's ready, it doesn't matter if he's 18 or 28,’ he said.

‘Unfortunately, or fortunately, there's always room for improvement, so maybe he didn't finish his football education in that natural way.

Wickham's goals towards the end of last season kept the Wearside club in the Premier League

Wickham's big money move from Ipswich possibly came too early, suggests Poyet

‘When you saw him at Ipswich at that age and you sign him for that money, naturally everyone thinks he has to play immediately.

‘He found himself in and out and coming back to the club with different managers and never in a position to play.

‘But it's been good for him so far (this season), he feels part of the team which is important and he's playing at the highest level, which is what he was looking for. You need to play against the very best to get better.’
