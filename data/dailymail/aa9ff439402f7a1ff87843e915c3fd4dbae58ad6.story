It was a landmark in the heart of Sarajevo that was left in ruins as Serbian shells battered the city again and again.

But 22 years after the Bosnian capital's City Hall was destroyed in one of the longest sieges in modern warfare, the building has finally been restored to its former glory.

The 
building, first opened in 1896, has been restored to mark the centenary 
of the start of World War One, triggered by the assassination of 
Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand just after he left a reception there 
in June 1914.

Sarajevo City Hall was largely destroyed in 1992 after the Serb shelling of the city. But ceremonies to mark the reopening of 'Vijecnica' as it is known in the city, are now due to take place on Friday

Converted 
into the National Library in 1949, it went up in flames in August 1992, 
destroying almost two million books including many rare volumes 
reflecting its multicultural life under the Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian
 empires.

The stately neo-Moorish edifice, which stands out in the city's old Turkish quarter with its 
dark orange and yellow horizontal stripes and Islamic-style arches, will
 house the national and university libraries, the city council and a 
museum about its own history.

The library was smashed to pieces on 
August 25 1992 during the Siege of Sarajevo and has since undergone a 
multi-million Euro reconstruction and restoration.

Ceremonies are now taking place to mark the reopening of 'Vijecnica' (city hall), as it is known here.

The same building that was left in ruins by the Serbian shelling has now undergone a major refurbishment costing millions of Euros. Some 22 years after it was destroyed, Sarajevo is preparing to welcome in a new era for the hall during an official opening ceremony

Vijecnica
 faces the Miljacka river and hills from which the Serb artillery set it
 ablaze, burning most of its books and manuscripts despite efforts by 
firefighters and volunteers who braved sniper fire to rescue at least 
part of the collection.

One elderly woman, named Minka, said of 
the opening: 'I am so glad it will be opened again. Especially because 
they rushed to destroy it but now they see it was in vain.'

Franz 
Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne in Vienna, attended a 
reception at Vijecnica on June 28, 1914 after surviving an failed 
assassination attempt. Just after leaving, he and his wife were shot 
dead in their open car by Serb assassin Gavrilo Princip.

His
 killing lit the fuse for World War One, in which more than 10 million 
soldiers died and the map of Europe was redrawn, ending Vienna's empire 
and creating the new state of Yugoslavia.

Now restored to its former glory, the building, which stands out in the city's old Turkish quarter with its dark orange and yellow horizontal stripes and Islamic-style arches, will house the national and university libraries, the city council and a museum about its own history

That
 multinational state began to fall apart in 1991 and war among the Serb,
 Croat and Muslim populations in Bosnia and Herzegovina began the 
following year and lasted until late 1995.

Vedran
 Smajlovic, a cellist who gained world recognition after a photograph 
showed him playing in the Vijecnica's ruins just days after its 
destruction, will play Albinoni's Adagio again but this time to 
celebrate life, not to mourn the dead.

'The energy in that building was something sacred,' Smajlovic said of his wartime performance.

'The building was still breathing, regardless of the destruction, I felt its power and it made me cry,' Smajlovic said.

Reconstruction work has been taking place for years ahead of the reopening of the City Hall, which is seen as a symbol of the city's turbulent past. It was completed with the help of the European Union.

Pictured before its grand opening, the bright interior of the restored building is shown in all its glory.  Special molds have been used to recreate some of the features that were lost during the shelling of 1992

The intricate designs that helped make the building a landmark for Sarajevo have been painstakingly restored, including the stain-glassed window on the roof. City Mayor Ivo Komsic said: 'The history of Vijecnica is the history of Sarajevo.'
