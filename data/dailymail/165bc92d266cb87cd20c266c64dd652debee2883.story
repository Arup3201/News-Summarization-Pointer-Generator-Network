An obese nurse who lost 10st and was left with folds of saggy skin all over her body paid £20,000 to get her sex life back.

Karen Smith, 42, from Nuneaton, Warwickshire, was so self-conscious about her baggy skin and drooping breasts, she felt 'more confident when she was fat.'

A former size 28, she took out a £10,000 loan and used an Eastern European clinic to have cheap surgery and achieve the 'body of her dreams'.

Karen Smith, 42, slimmed down from size 28 to size 12 but was so self-conscious about her baggy skin and drooping breasts, she spent thousands on surgery to fix her figure so that she could enjoy her sex life

She was so scared her husband would leave her because of her excess skin that she had an upper arm lift, a tummy tuck, thigh lift, breast augmentation and uplift.

Now, the size 12 mother from Nuneaton, Warwickshire, loves showcasing her body and dressing up for her husband Darren Smith, 43.

Size 28 Karen was extremely self-conscious and despite being active through work, Karen was unable to shift the pounds and weighed 21st thanks to a carb-heavy diet.

In 2009, she had lost two stone naturally but was unable to slim down any further. Karen was not eligible for treatment on the NHS, so in June 2009 she booked in for gastric band surgery at the private Spire Parkway hospital in Birmingham for £5,000.

She said: 'After the surgery, my stomach was so small I was on a liquid diet for six weeks and then tiny portions.'

Seven months after surgery, Karen had lost 9st 7lb and was a size 10 but she was left with folds of saggy skin due to the quick weight loss.

She was so scared her husband, Darren, 43, would leave her because of her flab, she had an upper arm lift, a tummy tuck, thigh lift, breast augmentation and uplift

She said: 'The baggy skin was worse than I’d ever imagined. Folds of flesh on my tummy meant slim cut jeans pinched.

'My bingo wings were so hefty. I had to go up to a size 12 just to cover my lumps and sagging bumps.'

Her husband comforted her but she was so horrified she was no longer able to have sex with him. 

She said: 'I’d been more confident fat. My 44C boobs had shrivelled to a 36AA.

'Where my full thunder thighs had once constantly rubbed, a waterfall of skin sagged between my legs.

'Just to get comfortable when sitting, I had to tuck the loose flesh into my knickers. 'The only way I could even look at myself was when I was fully dressed, all covered up.

'I couldn’t even bear for Darren to see me naked.'

After searching through the options available, Karen found she could afford to have surgery if it was performed abroad - and now she feels better than ever

Karen was so pleased with the results she wanted more surgery and taking Mr Smith's concerns on board, she opted to have more serious operations, a tummy tuck and thigh lift, in the UK

In late 2010, Karen made a doctors appointment to start the process of having the skin removed.

She said: 'All the procedures I’d need came in at £35,000. I couldn’t afford to have it done privately this time and it was making me severely depressed.'

After being turned down for a loan, Karen’s depression caused her to tell Mr Smith to leave her.

She said: 'We’d been together 22 years, had spent so long really happy but I couldn’t remember the last time we’d had sex.

'Every time he came close to me, I cringed imagining his secret disgust at how I looked. I knew it wasn’t rational.

'He refused and insisted I looked amazing and he loved me – but I was miserable and just couldn’t seem to pick myself up.'

Speaking about the excess skin, she said: 'Just to get comfortable when sitting, I had to tuck the loose flesh into my knickers The only way I could even look at myself was when I was fully dressed, all covered up'

Mr Smith knew how hard it was for his wife and they took out a smaller loan of £10,000.

After searching through the options available, Karen found she could afford to have surgery if it was performed abroad.

Mr Smith was concerned about the safety of the clinic so she opted to start with a simple procedure, an upper arm lift, at the Beauty in Prague Clinic in the Czech Republic.

She said: 'I was impressed by how clean the wards were and the qualifications of the surgeons.'

Just a day after the surgery in August 2012, the dressings were removed.

She said: 'My bingo wings were gone. In the 30 degree heat, I spent the next few days recuperating in the sun.' 

In 2009, she had lost two stone naturally but was unable to slim down any further. Karen was not eligible for treatment on the NHS, so in June 2009 she booked in for gastric band surgery at the private Spire Parkway hospital in Birmingham for £5,000

Karen was so pleased with the results she wanted more surgery and taking Mr Smith’s concerns on board, she opted to have more serious operations, a tummy tuck and thigh lift, in the UK.

Although the procedure went as planned, she was not entirely satisfied and booked more surgery in the Czech Republic.

She said: 'Seeing that problems can happen at home too, Darren agreed to me going abroad again.'

In April 2013, she headed back to Prague for breast augmentation, uplift and corrective surgery to her thighs.

Karen’s breasts were boosted from a AA to a DD and liposuction on her knees and thighs gave her the 'shapely pins' she had dreamed of.

She said: 'I’m so happy with my new body that you can barely get me to put it away.

'I’m wearing bikinis for the first time in years.

'Last year for our 25th anniversary we celebrated with a dirty weekend and we still get away together whenever we can.

'When Darren says I look great I can see his eyes on my curves and know it’s true. Now I’ve got my confidence back, our love life is back on track too. 

'We’re always going on dirty weekends away and I love shopping for new outfits in the bedroom.'
