Choosing bridesmaids is never easy but one bride found the perfect solution when she included all 44 of her closest friends in her wedding party.

Jayne Lawrence, 50, married Shaun on Saturday with 44 bridesmaids in attendance, as well as 12 page boys and three ushers.

Mrs Lawrence, from Halesowen in the West Midlands, was also walked down the aisle by three different guests and celebrated her big day with a total of 200 guests.

Britain's biggest wedding party? Jayne and Shaun Lawrence tied the knot with the help of 44 bridesmaids, as well as 12 page boys, three ushers and three people to walk the bride down the aisle in a 200 guest wedding ceremony 

 'I come from a really big family and I had always wanted to get everyone involved in my wedding,' explained the delighted bride.

'It just so happens that now I’ve ended up with 44 wonderful women to help me!'

The newlyweds have known each other since the age of 18 but didn't become a couple until a chance meeting in a pub brought them back together 10 years ago.

Mr Lawrence, 53,  proposed on his now-wife's birthday in May and, when she said yes, asked that they marry on his birthday in November.

Happy couple: Shaun, 53, and Jayne, 50, have known each other since they were 18 but bumped into each other in a pub ten years ago and struck up a romance, Shaun proposed on her birthday and now they've tied the knot in a huge wedding ceremony

Big day: The wedding was full of their friends and family who enjoyed a disco and buffet. Speaking about the ceremony, Jayne said: 'It was the most perfect day - just lovely. I come from a really big family, we very rarely get together'

Mrs Lawrence's sister Yvonne Hobbs, 71, was her maid of honour and walked Jayne down the aisle with her husband Glyn and their brother Stuart Blakeway, 48.

The other 43 bridesmaids were her nieces and great nieces as well as Mr Lawrence's nieces and some close family friends.

They were divided into teams and each group had a leader who arranged their shoes, accessories and matching dresses in varying shades of pink and purple.

She was even joined by 22 of her bridesmaids on her hen do - a night at a comedy club in Birmingham.

After marrying at St Paul’s Church in Blackheath, where Mrs Hobbs married 51 years ago, the couple enjoyed a buffet and disco and are hoping to honeymoon in Mexico in the new year.

Here they come! She was even joined by 22 of her bridesmaids on her hen do - a night at a comedy club in Birmingham - and they all wore coordinated colours on her big day

Headcount: Her sister was her maid of honour and the other 43 bridesmaids were her nieces and great nieces as well as Mr Lawrence's nieces and some close family friends

Family matters: After the happy couple got engaged, she started contacting nieces, and their children, and  close family friends to the event

'It was the most perfect day - just lovely,' added Mrs Lawrence. 'I come from a really big family, we very rarely get together.

'I’d always said that if I got married I wanted everyone in my family involved. Obviously I didn’t think I’d get married at 50 but I wasn’t going to change what I’d always said, and now, my family is even bigger so everyone got involved.

'After we got engaged I started contacting all my nieces, and their children, and my close family friends. Even people I had babysat for when I was 17 - they were there with their children.

'I’m one of nine, so my nieces are about the same age as me and we grew up together. Now they are all mums and grandmas too so everyone came along for the ride and I wouldn’t have had it any other way.'

A delighted Mr Lawrence added: 'It was a great day and I was just happy to leave the organising up to my wife!'
