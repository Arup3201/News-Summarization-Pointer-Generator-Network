It was an evening they wouldn't want to forget.

So, obviously, thousands of athletes involved in the Commonwealth Games Opening Ceremony last night captured the moment by taking a selfie - or two.

Competitors from around the world posted various portraits of themselves and their team mates on social media during the £20million celebration.

The competitors, who were chaperoned by Scottish Highland Terriers, took their time to soak up the atmosphere as they made their way around the city's Celtic Stadium - capturing as much of it as possible on their smartphones.

So perhaps it is no coincidence the 
ceremony overran by about 25 minutes - finishing past the event 
curfew enforced by organisers.

From
 Team England, boxer Nicola Adams MBE led the way with the selfies - posing for several 
pictures with her teammates while making her way around the city's 
Celtic Park stadium.

Singer Rod Stewart posted this rather odd image online last night - which appears to show the musician with no trousers on in front of the Celtic trophy case

Performer John Barrowman kicked off the night's selfie taking by posing for this portrait with several characters from the show - which included an appearance from the Loch Ness Monster (pictured) 

The competitor even took numerous pictures of herself outside the stadium while waiting to get in to the event.

front of the Celtic trophy cabinet following the evening's celebrations.

Performer John Barrowman kicked off the night's entertainment with a selfie also - capturing himself with numerous mascots as the celebration began.

He later embraced a male dancer in a kiss - a move that sparked a wealth of backing on Twitter last night.

The opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games - with its dancing Tunnock's Teacakes and show-stealing Scottie dogs - was watched by more than nine million viewers on BBC1.

The Glasgow spectacle, which featured musical performances by Rod Stewart and Nicola Benedetti, had a peak audience of 9.4 million - exceeding the number who watched the last time the Games were staged in the UK in 2002, when 8.9 million tuned in at the height of the Manchester opening.

An average of 7.6 million watched for the duration of the programme, which lasted more than three hours, down from the 8.2 million who stuck with the whole ceremony 12 years ago.

But the audience was up hugely on the levels for 2010 stage in Delhi, which drew an average of 3 million, and 2006 for Melbourne, which pulled in 1.3 million.

Last night's coverage accounted for more than two-fifths of the viewers watching TV at that time.

In Scotland, the audience peaked at 1.9 million viewers, accounting for more than three-quarters of those watching TV at the time.

BBC Scotland said it was one of the biggest average audiences ever recorded north of the border and the third best performing programme since 2001 after the opening and closing ceremonies of the London 2012 Olympic Games.

The boxer also posted this selfie while Team England waited outside the stadium for the action to begin
