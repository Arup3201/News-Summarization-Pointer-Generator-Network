An Argentinian divorcee who got a personal phone call from the Pope to calm her worries about whether she could take communion as a divorced woman has been pictured for the first time.

Jaqueline Sabetta, who married her new husband in 1994, asked the pontiff for advice about taking the Eucharist, which is traditionally forbidden for divorcees.

In a significant break from Catholic doctrine, Pope Francis told her that she would be ‘doing no harm’.

Call from above: Jaqueline Sabetta, from Santa Fe, Argentina, pictured with her husband Julio some years ago, got a personal phone call from Pope Francis to assure her that they could take communion, despite both having been married before

Message of love: By telling Mrs Sabetta that she would 'do no harm' by taking communion as a former divorcee, Pope Francis goes against Catholic tradition

Mrs Sabetta, who is from Santa Fe in the Pope’s home country of Argentina, wrote to him last year asking what to do, ‘given that to take communion would be violating one of the rules of the church’.

Seven months later she was amazed to receive a phone call at home from someone who ‘presented himself as father Bergoglio’, the Pope’s name before he was elected to lead the church.

After apologising for the lateness of his response, Pope Francis reportedly said: ‘It is a question that we are discussing at the Vatican, because a divorced person who takes communion is not doing any harm.’

Last month he told a morning mass in Rome that divorcees should not be condemned, but rather, ‘accompanied’.

The extraordinary phone call was revealed by Mrs Sabetta’s new husband Julio, who posted about it on Facebook on Easter Monday.

The Catholic Church forbids divorcees from taking communion, but Pope Francis has been looking for a solution to the problem saying that 'something must be done' to help those that want to

The couple, who are both divorced from their first partners, married in 1994 and have two children.

Mr
 Sabetta wrote online: ‘Today one of the best things that has ever 
happened to me, apart from the birth of our daughters, took place. We 
took a call at our house from none other than Papa Francisco.’

He
 said the Pope’s words had brought the devout couple ‘inner peace’, 
telling the Argentine media: ‘It was very emotional. We are still 
floating. I can tell you that when he speaks you feel total serenity.

‘The
 internal peacefulness that Francis has transmitted was a unique moment 
in my life. Afterwards we hugged and cried. He has given us the energy 
to go forward.’

Francis is becoming renowned for his impromptu phone calls to those who write to him.

Last year he comforted an Italian woman whose son had been murdered as he worked at a petrol station.

And in January he surprised a group of Spanish nuns when he left a message wishing them happy New Year, before ringing back later for a chat.

Vatican 
spokesman Ciro Benedettini said that the conversation was part of a 
private phone call. 'The Vatican does not comment on private calls made 
by the Pope', he said. 

But
 previously the Vatican denied claims by a gay Frenchman who said that 
Francis rang him personally and told him that his homosexuality was not a
 grave sin.

The news will be a balm to Catholic divorcees around the world who presently feel excluded from the church by a sense of shame.

A formal change in doctrine is expected be discussed at the Extraordinary Synod for the Family in October this year.

In
 the run up to the gathering, which is similar to a parliament, the 
Vatican has commissioned a ‘sex survey’ from every diocese in the world 
asking for parishioners’ opinions on divorce, gay marriage and 
celibacy.
