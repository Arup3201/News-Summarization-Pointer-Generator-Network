Emotions were running high outside the Maracana on Sunday night as Argentina fans appeared to fight amongst themselves after the World Cup final.

Scuffle: The Argentina fans appear to fight amongst themselves after the World Cup final on Sunday night

There were several protests before the game outside the stadium by Brazilians, due to their 'anti-corruption' campaign against FIFA.

In fact, many thought the hosts' fans and Argentines would be fighting each other considering the hostile rivalry between the two.

There were also sad scenes in Buenos Aires as riot police fired tear gas and used water cannons to restrain a group of youths who were hurling rocks and vandalizing stores at a celebration rally.

Parents with young children could be seen running down streets after police, who at first remained on the sidelines, tried to take back the area near the city's iconic Obelisk after 9pm local time.

Local media reported eight police officers were injured in violence late Sunday.
