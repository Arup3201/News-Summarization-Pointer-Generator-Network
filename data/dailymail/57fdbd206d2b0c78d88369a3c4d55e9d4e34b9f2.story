Young people are spending up to £100 a month attempting to emulate the style of their favourite celebrity icons, with Alexa Chung and David Beckham being the most frequently copied stars.

Cheryl Cole and Kim Kardashian are the other women young girls most like to resemble, while the boys are keen to look like Olly Murs.

Moreover, youngsters admit to suffering 'Insta-envy', feeling jealous about what famous people can afford to wear when they follow their favourite stars on photo-sharing site Instagram, according to a study.

Almost half of people aged 16 to 25 surveyed (47 per cent) said they spend an average of £100 a month copying the style of their favourite celebrities.

Furthermore, a similar number (46 per cent) admitted to 'Insta-envy', being jealous of their friends' and 
celebrities' wardrobes, chiefly brought about by overuse of photo-sharing on social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook.

Some 21 per cent of those surveyed say 'Insta-envy' and being unable to save money prevents them from saving for a house, and almost half (48 per cent) 
say not being able to save is preventing them from moving on 
with their life.

The
survey was undertaken by vInspired, a charity encouraging young people 
to volunteer, as part of their Get Trashed campaign, that aims to inspire young people 
to save over 10,000 clothes from landfill before February 2014 via 
swapping parties.

One third
of all clothes bought in the UK end up in landfill, chiefly the result 
of the popularisation 'fast fashion' shops selling cheap throwaway 
items.

Interestingly, despite all the 'fast fashion' shopping going on among them, 60 per cent of youngsters said they felt 
guilty about buying such cheap clothes for ethical reasons.

And only a small percentage of people surveyed (24 per cent) say the bulk of their wardrobe comes from charity shops, retro
stores or hand-me-downs from friends and parents.

Eight per cent say their parents are their biggest style inspiration.

Olly Murs' style was popular among young men

Terry Ryall, vInspired Chief Executive, said: 'Fast fashion might be cheap, but it comes with a cost. A cost to UK 
landfills, a cost to the global environment, and often a cost to human 
life.

'We want to change the way young people think about disposable 
fashion.'

vInspired is encouraging young
people to save as many items from landfill as they can - and save money 
at the same time - by getting involved in swapping parties or reviving 
clothes via customisation.

Stylist Grace Woodward said: 'I'm not surprised to see that 
Instagram is fuelling the need young people have to copy the style of 
their idols.

'It's an easy and accessible way to see what stars are 
wearing, get tips on what is on trend and keep up with what friends are 
wearing.

'We can clearly see that celebrity culture is ensuring a new 
generation of young people are growing up on a diet of fast fashion, 
however a growing number are rebelling and looking at to customisation 
and swapping to ensure they are unique in their style.'
