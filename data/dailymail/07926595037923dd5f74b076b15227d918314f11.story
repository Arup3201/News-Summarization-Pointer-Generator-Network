Little Apo Bakan, two, suffered a severe gash to the head when he tripped in one of the NHS's new Urgent Care Centres but incredibly was refused treatment because it 'didn't deal with things like this'

A two-year-old bleeding heavily from a severe head wound was refused emergency first aid at an NHS urgent care centre – even though he suffered the injury in the waiting room.

Apo Bakan tripped and banged his head on a chair, leaving a gash on his forehead that exposed his skull. His mother Linzi pleaded for help but a nurse and a GP told her to go to the nearest A&E unit instead because they didn’t deal with ‘things like this’.

Mrs Bakan, 27, said: ‘Apo was covered in blood. When I saw his skull I was hysterical. I begged staff to help but they wouldn’t. There was no comfort, no care and no compassion.’

Mrs Bakan had taken Apo to the 
Doctor Piper House Urgent Care Centre in Darlington with her husband, 
also called Apo, in May 2012 to ask about a skin complaint. The boy’s 
wound was later stitched up at The University Hospital of North Durham.

A PCT spokesman said it could not comment on the case.

The
incident was revealed after a probe into UCCs, which are earmarked to 
replace A&E units, found they are inadequately staffed, with some 
personnel not qualified to prescribe drugs.

Health officials are keen to roll out 
the clinics in order to free up space in over-crowded casualty units. 
In many hospitals, a UCC acts as the first port of
call for patients, who are then referred to the A&E next door if 
necessary.

But there are serious concerns the units are not up to the job - and could actually increase strain on the NHS.

In London, five major A&Es have 
been downgraded to become UCCs staffed by GPs and nurses but with no 
emergency care consultants.

The downgraded departments will be 
prevented from treating a huge array of life-threatening illnesses, such
as shock, internal bleeding, most broken bones, breathing problems, 
heart attacks and strokes.

Linzi Bakan and her husband Apo were left furious when the Urgent Care Centre in Darlington wouldn't treat little Apo

There has been huge opposition from 
doctors and patients during a public consultation period, and 
campaigners argue that residents in some of the most deprived areas of 
the capital will be put at risk.

The Primary Care Foundation report, written by GPs, NHS managers and consultants, examined 15 undisclosed UCCs across England.

It
said: ‘The availability of particular types of service often varied by 
time of day. Sometimes, this was planned (so X-ray facilities might be 
available for only part of the opening hours, or GPs might be available 
for part of the time only).

‘This
variability increases the  risk that a patient may attend for a  
condition that cannot be treated by the service, increasing delay and 
clinical risk.’

Some UCCs 
offered a full range of services and skilled staff that was nearly the
same as a fully functioning A&E. But others were little more than 
walk-in centres that could treat only the simplest cases seen in GP 
surgeries.

Some centres offered ‘nurse only’ services with no doctors on
duty, which meant that the type of patient who could be seen and 
treated depended on the qualifications of the nurse on duty.

The
report concluded UCCs should be able to treat or refer all patients who
attended and that there should be no unnecessary delay.

It
has called on NHS chiefs to ‘make sure that the advertised services are
available consistently over time and not subject to variation depending
on who is on duty’ in order to protect patients.
