Ex On The Beach star Jess Impiazzi has been signed up by bargain fashion brand In The Style to be the face of their new South Beach swimwear range.

Brand bosses say they spotted Jess strutting her perfect bikini body on the MTV show and knew immediately she was the right girl for the job of pushing their latest swimwear pieces.

The model, who is most famous for her fleeting TV appearance on the reality show, has recently been in the headlines for clashing with the rather more established swimwear star Kelly Brook, claiming that the actress called her a 'slut' for getting involved with her ex David McIntosh.

Kelly and David famously called off their engagement last year, and in the months after Jess and David enjoyed a fleeting romance.

It wasn't until Jess and Kelly were locked into a phone conversation, the beauty explained to The Sun On Sunday earlier this month, that the former Big Breakfast host allegedly expressed her frustrations.

Jess recalled of their conversation: 'She went, "Are you and David dating - are you together? What's going on?" I said: "Nothing really, we're just friends.'"

The 25-year-old, who claims she wasn't aware until then that Kelly and David were speaking again, added: 'I said, "Kelly, there's no need to try and upset me. I'm not in love with the guy. There's no need to be horrible. I don't care."

And also dated Kelly Brook's ex David McIntosh for a short time after he split from Kelly

The 25-year-old also played a small part in TOWIE in 2012's fourth series, where she meddled in Mario Falcone's relationship with Lucy Mecklenburgh when it was discovered that he was texting multiple girls

'She said, "Let's hope you're not lying to me like all the other sluts. Nice talking to you Jess. Bye." She made me feel like a bit of an idiot.'

It's not the first time that exes have been the centre of attention for Jess, who shot to fame in a reality TV show that sees glamorous stars washed up on a remote island where they might unexpectedly face ex-partners (also deserted on the island) or find new love with fellow singletons.
