If you didn't get a chance to watch the Super Bowl adverts, don't despair - the most popular of Sunday night's commercials have been recreated in Lego.

Stop-motion animated film Brick Bowl film follows an American football fan as he wanders into the Super Bowl adverts for brands such as T-Mobile, Snickers and Toyota.

The figure is seen searching for a lost dog in a take on Busweiser's emotional ad, photo bombing a Lego Kim Kardashian's tennis selfie for T-mobile and taking on a challenger in a version of Skittles' arm wrestling competition.

Brick Bowl, by UK-based A+C Studios, refashioned scenes from this year's crop of Super Bowl ads, including Snickers and Skittles, using thousands of Lego bricks

The three and a half minute video was created using thousands of Lego bricks by the UK-based A+C Studios within just 36 hours.

Most Super Bowl adverts are kept under wraps until they air during the game so the animators had to work quickly to recreate the content.

Dan Richards, director at A+C Studios, told the Telegraph: 'Stop motion productions can take anywhere between four months to four years to make. Turning this animation around in 36 hours and working with Lego to recreate the most prestigious ad slot in history into a new story has been a huge accomplishment.'

The Skittles arm wrestling competition advert also features with the figure, and dog spot, arriving to challenge a competitor

A+C was the studio behind last year's animated advert from Harrods which tells the story of a mouse turning on the store's Christmas lights.

The studio used a big team of model makers, animators, editors and storyboard artists, along with specialized animation software and equipment to create the film.

The film kicks off with the fan settling down on his sofa to watch the New England Patriots take on the Seattle Seahawks when the TV coverage cuts to the break and he dives into the commercials .

Esurance's Breaking Bad parody, As he falls through each ad, the figure is also seen being chased through a maze by Bud Light's Pac Man, a disastrous attempt t snowboarding with Amy Purdy for Toyota's and a tense chat with a Lego Walter White in Esurance's Breaking Bad parody.

Snickers' Brady Bunch remake, Katy Perry's half-time show and Jurassic Park's new trailer were also featured.

This year's Super Bowl game attracted a record 114.4m viewers to the live broadcast with advertisers baying to get a slice of air time.

As the most expensive advertising slot in the world, just 30 seconds of air time costs $4.5m (£2.97m).

Budweiser's story of the lost dog was rated the best ad of the Super Bowl by USA Today's Ad Meter, which asks a consumer panel of roughly 6,700 people to vote for each advert. Busweiser's was also declared the Super Bowl's most viral ad, racking up more than 2m shares by Monday.
