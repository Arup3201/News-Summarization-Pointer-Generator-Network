A British soldier has been charged with raping a six-year-old girl at her home in Austria.

The man, believed to be a bombardier from 7th Parachute Regiment Royal Horse Artillery, is accused of assaulting the girl after climbing through the window of her home while drunk.

Her father woke up after hearing a noise and allegedly found the half-naked soldier in his daughter's bedroom in the village of Neustift im Stubaital.  

Accused: A British soldier has been charged with raping a six-year-old girl at her home in the village of Neustift im Stubaital (pictured) in the Tyrol region of the Austrian Alps 

The soldier, who is based at a barracks in Essex, was remanded in custody on a charge of rape. 

He was taking part of an alpine training course in the Tyrol region of the Austrian Alps when the alleged incident occurred in December.

The soldier, who has not been named, was due to return to his base at Merville Barracks in Colchester the next day.  

Local officials said there had been some debate about whether the case would be dealt with by the British military.

But it has now been revealed that he will face criminal charges in Austria. 

He is due in court on March 10 and could face up to ten years in prison.
