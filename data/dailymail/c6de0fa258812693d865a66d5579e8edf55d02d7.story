Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp has attacked Bayern Munich's conduct for admitting interest in Marco Reus and claims their comments could come back to bite them.

The Bundesliga champions have riled Klopp this week after Bayern Munich chairman Kerl-Heinz Rummenigge talked openly about a move for attacking midfielder Reus.

Klopp accused Bayern of kicking his side when they're down as Dortmund currently lie 15th in the Bundesliga ahead of their visit to league leaders Munich on Saturday.

Earlier this week Rummenigge told Bild: 'We know in Munich that Reus has a lot of quality. For us a young German national player of such quality is interesting. But I do not want to cause unrest in Dortmund.'

In response Klopp told Bild: 'In a period where both teams are at the top, it's fun to reply to any questions,' adding that he knows 'nothing of what is going on right now' regarding Reus' contract situation.

Klopp's side are well off the pace in the Bundesliga so far, with just seven points from the opening nine fixtures.

'In our current position, where this causes relatively little enjoyment, it is just not worth it,' added Klopp.

'However, I believe that life is fair. Whoever behaves badly while they succeed can get payback later.

'We currently do not have the problem of having to behave well during a period of success, because we are not in one,' he added.

Despite their poor form, Dortmund did beat Bayern 2-0 in the German Super Cup at the start of the season
