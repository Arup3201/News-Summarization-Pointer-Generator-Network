Mysterious: The Environment Agency and local council have yet to discover what lies behind the deaths

Experts have ruled out the theory that deadly blue-green algae is to blame.

Worthington Borough Council has also investigated the deaths, but concluded the cause of death was ‘not apparent’.

Senior animal rescue officer Billy Elliott, from Worthing and District Animal Rescue Service, said: ‘I have been down to the lake every day for the past three weeks and have had to pull out at least two dead animals a day.

‘The situation has never been this bad before. Our charity is meant to help the animals before it is too late, and I feel like we are letting them down.

‘Just last week a mother came down with her child to feed the ducks, and was horrified to discover dead floating ducklings.'

Ruled out: Experts have said deadly blue-green algae is not to blame for the deaths

Joe Giacomelli, at the Environment Agency, said: ‘Our investigations into this incident are ongoing as it is too early to draw any conclusion on its cause.

‘Last week we took water samples and these initial tests ruled out the presence blue green algae at that time.

‘We are awaiting results of further samples to ascertain whether any pollutant caused this or whether it was a natural event.’

A spokesperson at Worthing Borough Council said the council could not afford to dredge the lake.
