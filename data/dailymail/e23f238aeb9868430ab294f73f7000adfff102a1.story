Stunning images of outer space have been released, which have been taken by amateur astronomers and photographers.

The Central West Astronomical Society received more than 200 entrants across Australia and picked the best of the best for the 10th annual David Malin Awards, as part of the CWAS AstroFest.

The overall winner of the astrophotography awards was Paul Haese of South Australia for his incredible image of the Orion Nebula - titled 'Dust and Gas'.

Judged by world renowned astrophotographer, Dr David Malin, who told Daily Mail Australia the standard of this year's entrants was highly outstanding.

Paul Haese's image, submitted in the Solar System - Wide-Field category, was the photo editors pick. It's entitled 'Prominence'

Phil Hart also entered an image in The Moon category, with his award-winning photo 'Marine Moonset'

David Fitz-Henry's photo 'The Horsehead and Flame Nebulas' was also awarded the Photo Editor's Choice

Dr Malin, who's been in the industry for 40 years, was particularly impressed by Mr Haese's image.

'I think it is the best true-colour image of the Orion Nebula I have seen for a long time,' he said.

'It has everything. The basics are well covered by a realistic-looking colour balance and the dynamic range, which makes the heart of the nebula look brighter than everything else, which is as it should be. But the other things are right too, including the delicate, faint nebulosity that fills the field and the careful handling of the bright stars, which don't dominate the image.' 

AstroFest organiser John Sarkissian told Daily Mail Australia he was satisfied that CWAS is able to showcase the Australian talent.

'Each year the event has become better and better and the quality of the photos are phenomenal,' he said.

Winners were presented with their awards at the CWAS AstroFest conference dinner in Parkes, central west region of NSW, on July 19. 

An exhibition of the photos will be on display at CSIRO Parkes Observatory's Visitors Centre until July next year while a second touring exhibition, with a selection of images organised by the Powerhouse Museum, will travel to selected venues throughout Australia.

It began at the Sydney Observatory and is now in Melbourne.

Last year, Mr Sarkissian said the exhibitions attracted about 234,000 viewers from across the nation.
