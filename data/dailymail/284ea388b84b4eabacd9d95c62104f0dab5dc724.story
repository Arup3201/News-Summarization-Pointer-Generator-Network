Gun sales have increased at a staggering rate in Ferguson, Missouri, ahead of a grand jury's decision on whether or not to indict Officer Darren Wilson, the cop who shot dead unarmed teenager Michael Brown.

Steve King, the owner of Metro Shooting Supplies in nearby Bridgeton, says he has sold 250 firearms this week.

That is a 700% increase over the 30 to 40 guns the store typically sells in a week.

Big numbers: Steve King (above), owner of Metro Shooting Supplies in Bridgeton, Missouri, says gun sales at his store have increased 700%, selling 250 firearms just this week

Sign him up: Steve King fills out paperwork while selling a handgun to Dave Benne at Metro Shooting Supplies. Mr Benne, a resident of Florissant, near Ferguson, said the Grand Jury prompted his purchase

Will he or won't he: King says gun sales are increasing 'because of Ferguson,' and as the community waits to see if Officer Darren Wilson (above) will be indicted by a grand jury for shooting dead Michael Brown 

Tragic end: Brown (above) was unarmed when he was shot dead by Wilson on August 9

'These people are afraid,' he told The Washington Post.

'One hundred percent of them are buying because of Ferguson.' 

This as the FBI has warned  law enforcement agencies across the country that the grand jury verdict in this case 'will likely' lead to violence.

The grand jury decision is expected to come this month.

Meanwhile, Governor Jay Nixon has declared a state of emergency in Missouri and activated the National Guard, citing the 'possibility of expanded unrest.'

The state of emergency will last 30 days unless extended by another order.

Making themselves heard: Protesters on both sides of the argument feel very strongly, leading the FBI to warn that the grand jury verdict in this case 'will likely' lead to violence

No doubt fueling many of these fears of unrest are reports like the one that came out on Tuesday claiming that Ferguson's own cops and their supporters were urging people to go out and get guns on online message boards.

'If you do not have a gun, get one and get one soon. We will not be able to protect you or your family,' said one commentor on the forum St Louis Cop Talk.

Then there is the report that a militant group is offering a cash reward for anyone who can give them the location of Willson. 

A group describing itself as a 'Militant Resistance' to a 'corrupt police state' has offered $5000 for details of Ferguson police officer's  whereabouts.

Brown was shot by Wilson on August 9 in Ferguson.

Wilson allegedly claimed, according to his grand jury testimony which was leaked to the public, that he saw Brown and his friend Don Johnson walking down the middle of the road that day, and thought Brown matched the description of a young man involved in a recent robbery.

When he tried to stop the boys, he sayid Brown punched him through the window. 

He sayid he drew the weapon but Brown tried to wrestle it from him while continuing to punch him in the face. 

His side: Wilson says Brown (above in photo) punched him in the face and tried to wrestle his gun away on August 9 before he shot at the teenager

The other side: Other eyewitnesses say that Brown (whose memorial can be seen above) had his hands up and to his side, and urged Wilson not to shoot

During that struggle for his gun, Wilson said he got off two shots, missing the Brown on the first and hitting him in the hand with the second.

When Brown tried to escape, Wilson allegedly stated that he continued to shoot, firing off the fatal volley of shots when Brown turned and started rushing towards him.

This account is in stark contrast with that of several eye witnesses, and Brown's companion Johnson, who have claimed that the unarmed teen had his hands up, or by his side, and begged the officer 'Stop shooting.'

The office of St Louis Prosecutor Bob McCulloch have said that they will unseal all evidence reviewed by the Grand Jury following their decision and release it to the public.
