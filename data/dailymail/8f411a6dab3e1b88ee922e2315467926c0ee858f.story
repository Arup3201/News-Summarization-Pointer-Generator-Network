David Cameron has been accused of hypocrisy after he was caught out shopping in Waterstones yesterday - the day his Government encouraged Britons to shop local for Small Business Saturday.

The Prime Minister had earlier been keen to show his support for the initiative with a photo opportunity at a local butchers in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire.

He had even taken to Twitter to boast: 'Supporting #SmallBizSatUK by picking up lamb chops from Cobbs Butchers - I'm cooking dinner for my mum tonight.'

Says one thing: Prime Minister David 
Cameron seen in a photo opportunity arranged with the Press Association visiting family butchers, A Cobb, in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, 
to mark 'Small Business Saturday'

But once the photographers had 
departed, so too apparently did his shop-local principles. He was 
shortly after spotted at the town's Waterstones, one of the nationwide 
chain's 300 branches.

Aylesbury
Waterstones tweeted: 'The lovely David Cameron came in to do some 
Christmas shopping today. He knows a quality bookshop when he sees one!'

But
that wasn't all. Minutes later, he was pictured with a barista after 
popping into Caffe Nero for a cup of coffee. The chain has more than 600
coffee shops in the UK, Europe and the Middle East.

Mr
Cameron's visits to the chain stores appear to fly in the face of the 
Small Business Saturday initiative, which is designed to encourage 
people to use local shops and businesses rather than the chain stores 
increasingly dominating Britain's high streets.

Does another: Mr Cameron takes a bite of meat. He was shortly afterwards spotted shopping for books in a nearby Waterstones, a retailer with 300 branches, before popping into Caffe Nero, which has 600 branches

Politicians from all major parties were keen to be seen visiting their local shops, advertising their presence to their followers on social media.

Mr Cameron said of the event: 'Small businesses are the lifeblood of our country - essential for building a resilient, sustainable economy and a central part of my long-term economic plan for Britain.

'They account for 99 in every 100 businesses and keep more than 11 million people in work so this isn't about sentimentality, it's about the future of Britain, creating jobs and turning our economy around.

'I'm determined that we back them in every way we can - that's what today is all about and that's what this Government is about.'

But political opponents suggested that Mr Cameron's actions spoke louder than his words.

Responding to the message by Aylesbury Waterstones, shadow business minister Toby Perkins tweeted sarcastically: 'Tell him thanks for his support for #SmallBizSatUK.'

Mr Perkins added: '@david_cameron probably thinks @waterstonesayl IS a small business! #SmallBizSatUK.'

Labour MP Simon Danczuk told the Sunday Mirror: 'Even on Small Business Saturday, David Cameron says one thing and does another.

'Hours after using a photo opportunity to brag on Twitter about buying chops from a local butcher, it emerges when the cameras were turned off he did his Christmas shopping at Waterstones, which has almost 300 branches rather than a local bookshop.'

■ President Barack Obama also visited a bookshop on Small Business Saturday, which was held a week earlier in the U.S. - but he managed to find an independent one.

Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha dropped in to Washington's Politics and Prose book store and bought what he said was a ‘long list’ of books that included The Kite Runner, Harold and the Purple Crayon, and The Sports Gene.

The President said he bought a reader for every age, from 5 to 52 - his age.
