A grieving mother has received a handwritten apology from Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt after doctors failed to spot her son's cancer for six months.

Musician Lee Wyatt was just 25 when he died of bowel cancer in 2010 after being repeatedly misdiagnosed during almost six months of visits to his GP practice.

Suffering abdominal pain and struggling to eat, the DJ and music producer from Denton, Greater Manchester, was initially prescribed painkillers after being told he had pulled a muscle while playing tennis.

He was also given iron tablets after it was found he was severely anaemic and it was suspected that he had an ulcer.

Fears that Mr Wyatt had cancer were finally confirmed in December 2008 but a scan failed to detect the illness had already spread to his liver.

This led to him having a 14-hour operation at Stepping Hill Hospital to remove his bowel, spleen and part of his pancreas.

An independent oncologist looking into the case has since found the operation was 'inappropriate and excessive'.

Last year Mr Wyatt's mother Linda, 56, received an out-of-court settlement of Â£10,000 after a joint action against Stockport NHS Foundation Trust and the Windmill Medical Centre, in Denton, for alleged medical negligence.

Now the heart-broken mother has received a letter from Mr Hunt in which he says he has raised the case with health regulators.

'Dear Ms Wyatt,

Thank you for your letter. I have replied formally but I wanted to reply personally to say how sorry I was to read about what happened to Lee. It is totally unacceptable to get a cancer diagnosis wrong so many times. Nothing I say will make up for the sadness of what happened, but I would like to apologise to you on behalf of the government and the NHS for what happened.

'There is much excellent care in the NHS but still too many things like this that go wrong. We are doing a number of things to improve the quality of cancer diagnosis, but your request shows there is much more work to be done.

'Once again I am sorry for what happened. Yours sincerely, Jeremy Hunt.'

The first page of Mr Hunt's letter expressed how sorry he was to hear of her Ms Wyatt's son's death and apologised on behalf of the Government and the NHS

He goes on to add that there is 'much more work to be done' in improving the NHS, before personally signing off 'Jeremy Hunt'

A formal response from the Health Secretary (pictured) also pledged to pass on Ms Wyatt's concerns as a formal complaint to the NHS should she wish to do so

In a handwritten letter, Mr Hunt said: 'It is totally unacceptable to get a cancer diagnosis wrong so many times.

'Nothing I say will make up for the sadness of what happened, but I would like to apologise on behalf of the government and the NHS for what happened.'

He signs off: 'Once again I am so sorry for what happened.'

Ms Wyatt is now calling for people to be tested for cancer before any other illnesses, if they suspect they have symptoms.

She urged: 'This is about finding justice for Lee. He put his trust in doctors and he was let down.

'I don't think bowel cancer was considered because of his age. Just because you don't fit that criteria, trivial things are ruled out, but lives could be saved.'

Stockport NHS Foundation Trust expressed sympathy with the family.

A spokesman said: 'In the time since, our MRI scanners have been upgraded and we believe lesions could be correctly classified with far greater confidence.'

The Windmill Medical Centre declined to comment.
