They may not be the most elegant of names, but they are certainly eye-catching.

And no one could blame the postman if he titters when he's delivering letters to homes in Bum, Tittybong, Climax or Intercourse.

Now someone has created an interactive map of the world's most suggestive place names - and probably become a hero to immature teenagers everywhere.

Nob Hill can be spotted on the map, which will surely become a much loved website of anyone with an infantile sense of humour

San Francisco's Nob Hill may raise eyebrows with its unfortunate name - but at least it will give residents a laugh

Those living in Tittybong, Australia must surely be tired of seeing people smirk when they tell them where they live

Perhaps Tittybong's name put residents off staying there - as the lonely looking area in Australia is deserted

Among the others highlighted on the map are Poo in India, Pee in Liberia, Bitche in France and Arsoli in Italy.

And if those weren't enough to prompt a snigger, there's Vagina in Russia, Anus in the Philippines and Gland in Switzerland.

There are places with names to make you blush - but you'll have to find them yourselves.

The map titled Vaguely Rude Place Names Of The World was created by geographer and Nokia's director of places Gary Dale from south-west London.

Toilet humour: The town of Poo in Spain is certain to prompt a chuckle from those with an imaginative mind

Poo in Spain has a beach - and is considered to be a far nicer place than its name might initially suggest

A high point of the map is Climax,  Georgia - which might conjure up a couple of images that homeowners there don't want you to think about

Climax in Georgia is sure to be popular with those roaming the map for more giggles

Bald Knob, Arkansas, US

Phuket, Thailand

Shyte Brook, Shropshire, UK

Spanker Knob, Australia

Bumbang, Australia,

Fanny's Cross, Devon, UK

Wet Beaver Creek, Arizona, US

Seymen, Turkey

Crotch Lake, Ontario, Canada

Sandy Balls Estate, Hampshire, UK

Mr Dale modestly describes his work as 'a classic Web 2.0 style maps mashup [that will] never win any awards for originality or innovativeness'.

'Maybe it's part of bring British, but an airport whose code is BUM is just â€¦ funny,' he said.

'The source of each of these vaguely rude sounding names was from Yahoo's WOE data set, before the data was released via the GeoPlanet API and (currently offline) GeoPlanet Data download.'A list of real but amusing sounding place names, culled from GeoPlanet by one of the old Yahoo! Geo team, has been sitting in a file on one of my backup drives for too many years now.'But given a geographic data set. Stamen's wonderful Toner map tiles and a JavaScript maps API, in this case Leaflet, the temptation to make a map out of it all was just too strong.'Yes it's a map, yes it's geographical innuendo and yes, it's very much part of the British sense of humour.'If you're British, try not to snigger too much; if you're not British, just shake your head sadly and mutter "those crazy Brits".'

The UK has more than its fair share of rude place names, not least Six Mile Bottom in Cambridgeshire

Snigger, snigger: Bum, in Sierra Leone, west Africa, would make most schoolboys laugh

Spread Eagle in Newfoundland, Canada, is one of the more polite place names

Intercourse in Pennsylvania, U.S., is another place with a very unfortunate name
