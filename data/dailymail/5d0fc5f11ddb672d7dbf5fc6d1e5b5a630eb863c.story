Forensic tests on the body of Argentine state prosecutor Alberto Nisman who accused the President of a cover-up with Iran indicate that he was murdered, his ex-wife said today.

He was found shot dead in the bathroom of his locked apartment in January, hours before he was due to testify against President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner in the Argentinian Congress.

He was trying to arrest the President after claiming she helped cover up Iran's alleged role in a 1994 bombing which killed 85 at a Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires.

The mysterious circumstances surrounding Mr Nisman's death unleashed a storm of conspiracy theories. His ex-wife, Sandra Arroyo Salgado, hired a private team to analyse the autopsy results and run additional tests.

Argentine authorities have not released full results of his autopsy, more than six weeks after he was found sprawled in a pool of blood in his flat. 

The few details made public so far have suggested suicide, although the lead investigator into Mr Nisman's death said she could not categorically say if he shot himself in the head or was killed.

But today, his ex-wife - the mother of their two children - said: 'Nisman didn't have an accident. He didn't commit suicide. They murdered him.' 

Earlier today, Ms Arroyo Salgado, who is a judge, deposited the forensic evidence backing up her allegations at the state prosecutors' office in Buenos Aires. She did not give details of the findings to journalists.

Yesterday, a full-page advert, signed by the Government of Argentina and bearing an Argentinian flag, questioned Mr Nisman's motives and attacked his argument.

'One must ask oneself what objectives Nisman was pursuing with a complaint plagued with contradictions, lacking logic and without legal basis,' it declared.

'Can one think of a hypothesis other than seeking to generate a destabilising political effect?'

Mr Nisman had accused the President and top administration officials of helping Iranian officials hide their and Iran's alleged role in the country's worst-ever terrorist attack. 

His 289-page investigation, which was published a few days after his death, was based on wiretaps of top administration officials that he argued proved the secret deal with Iran.

According to Mr Nisman, the President allegedly orchestrated the deal in exchange for economic trade.

Ms Kirchner rejected the allegations, and Iran denied any role in the bombing.

The prosecutor was found shot in the head in his apartment in the capital's upmarket Puerto Madero district on January 18, triggering protests in the streets.

His mysterious death triggered a PR fightback by the government, whose officials said the prosecutor was trying to smear the nation.

Senior government official Gustavo Lopez claimed last month the allegations were part of an attempt to unseat the President and bring neoliberals back to power.

'We are facing an attempted coup d'etat, that aims to get rid of the president,' he wrote.

But the alleged smears have upset other politicians.

Cornelia Schmidt-Liermann told the Associated Press: 'It's awful to see so many accusations against a person who can't defend himself.

'Instead of clarifying anything, Fernandez is damaging the investigation into Nisman's death.'

Horror: The 1994 bombing of a Buenes Aires Jewish centre, run by the Argentine Israelite Mutual Association, left 85 dead and remains the country's most deadly terrorist attack. Iran has denied it was involved

Yesterday's newspaper advert highlighted a judge's ruling which said Mr Nisman's argument had a lack of 'coherence and integration'.

Judge Daniel Rafecas, who made the ruling, said: 'There is not a single element of evidence, even circumstantial, that points to the head of state.'

That ruling was appealed yesterday by prosecutor Gerardo Pollicita, who has taken up the case following Mr Nisman's death.

He said the judges' decision was 'premature' and an investigation was needed to 'prove or disprove the facts'.

The appeal sends the case to the Federal Chamber of judges, which can uphold or reject last week's decision by federal Judge Rafecas. 

Argentinians will go to the polls in October, but the President is barred from running for a third term by the country's constitution and will have to step down.

She has nevertheless gone on the offensive, accusing opposition parties of using the row for political gain and claiming the U.S. and Israel were meddling in Argentina's affairs.
