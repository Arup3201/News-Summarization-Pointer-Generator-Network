A springer spaniel survived after leaping 50 feet from an infamous ‘dog suicide’ bridge - with no broken bones.

Owner Alice Trevorrow, 50, was walking Cassie across Overtoun Bridge, near Dumbarton, when her pet suddenly jumped over a parapet onto the stony ground below.

Mrs Trevorrow and her son Thomas, 24, peered over the bridge fearing the worst but were shocked to see three-year-old Cassie struggle to her feet.

This is the spot where Cassie the springer spaniel jumped from the 50ft high Overtoun Bridge, near Dumbarton, which has been dubbed the 'dog suicide bridge'

Mrs Trevorrow, a staff nurse, said: 'I will never forget the awful whine she made as she leapt.

'My heart just dropped. I have no idea how she survived, the bridge is so high. I was almost certain that she had died.

Mrs Trevorrow said Cassie raced over to the bridge as soon she got out of their car and looked left as though she had seen something.

Cassie then jumped off, something Mrs Trevorrow said was 'so uncharacteristic, she has never done anything like that before'.

Cassie only suffered a pulled muscle in her leg, something Mrs Trevorrow said was a 'complete miracle'

She added: 'My son looked down and all he could see was a dot. She managed to get herself up and met my son, collapsing when she saw him.

'Luckily she didn’t have any serious injuries, just a pulled muscle in one of her back legs. It is a complete miracle.'

Only one other dog has been known to survive falling from the 19th century bridge which is higher than a four-storey building.

The landmark has been dubbed the 'dog suicide bridge' as it is believed between 50 and 100 dogs have jumped to their deaths from it in the last five decades.

Mrs Trevorrow was unaware of the bridge's eerie history before she walked Cassie there and is now campaigning for warning signs to be put up to warn other dog owners

The unexplained phenomenon has prompting the Scottish SPCA to send an animal habitat expert to investigate why dogs are jumping off.

It is believed that the odour from male minks could be luring the dogs to their deaths. While some simply believe the bridge is haunted.

Professor Peter Neville from the department of animal sciences at Ohio University said it was 'highly unlikely' that the dogs were deliberately jumping to their deaths.

He said dogs live in the present, so 'are unable to contemplate the future and how they will be feeling', and make plans accordingly.

Professor Neville said: 'Of course dogs do get depressed, but this would not lead them to taking their own life.'

Mrs Trevorrow said she was not aware of the bridge's history, and had no concerns when she walked Cassie three three weeks ago.

'I had never heard of this happening before even though I’ve lived here for 25 years. But now I know all about the stories. I’m quite a spiritual person and I believe that Cassie was protected that day.

'How else do you explain how she escaped with no broken bones, not even a fracture. She should have a shattered pelvis after falling from that height.'

The Dumbarton mum-of-two is now campaigning to have a sign erected to warn other dog walkers.

She has contacted MSP Jackie Baillie who intends to lobby the council.

Ms Baillie said: 'This is not the first time this has happened. I have heard many heart-breaking stories about dog owners who have lost their pets due to this unexplained phenomenon.'

In the last 50 years it between 50-100 dogs have lept to their deaths from the bridge seen below

Only two dogs are believed to have survived the four-storey fall.

During one six month period in 2005, five dogs jumped to their deaths.

All of the deaths occurred at the same spot on the bridge.

Almost all have occurred on clear, sunny days.

The dogs involved were all long-nosed breeds: Labradors, collies and retrievers.

It has long been thought the bridge, and nearby Overtoun House are haunted.

In Celtic mythology, Overtoun is known as 'the thin place' - an area in which heaven and earth are reputed to be close.

In 1994, local man Kevin Moy threw his baby son to his death from the bridge.

Shortly after he unsuccessfully tried to end his own life by jumping from it.

Professor Peter Neville said it was 'highly unlikely' the dogs were trying to kill themselves.

Dorren Graham, of the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, calls the dog jumping phenomenon a 'heartbreaking mystery'.

It is thought odour from male minks could be luring the dogs to their deaths.
