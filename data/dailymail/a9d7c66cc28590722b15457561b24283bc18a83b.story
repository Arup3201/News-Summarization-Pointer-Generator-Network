At a glance they look like images created by Hollywood CGI wizards – but they’re actually landscapes created entirely from food.

The incredible creations are the work of ‘foodscape’ artist Carl Warner, who makes them using sweets, fruits and vegetables – plus some pins and superglue.

Mr Warner’s scenes include the London skyline – complete with St. Paul’s Cathedral, The London Eye and Tower Bridge – and a mountain range featuring the Chocolate Express.

What’s more, one of the scenes will be on display as a model, with the finishing touches applied on Friday at the Piccadilly Circus attraction.

Called 'Crockerville', it's a village created from over 2,000 cookies and chocolate rocky road that took three weeks to create.

No doubt there will be signs warning the public not to touch – or eat.
