A woman who suffered chronic depression for 20 years says she was cured overnight – thanks to breast enhancement surgery.

Mother-of-two Jill Walker, 43, says the illness that had affected most of her adult life lifted as soon as she came back from the operating theatre after having implants fitted.

She says losing all her breast tissue during her second pregnancy triggered low self-confidence and a loathing for her own body.

Just 12 days after receiving her redundancy package, Jill had an operation to boost her chest from a 32A (right) to a 32E (left)

But having been turned down for surgery on the NHS, Ms Walker had consigned herself to a lifetime of depression.

But this changed when she was made redundant from her job after 17 years of service as a traffic warden for the Met Police Service.

Just 12 days after receiving her redundancy package she had an operation to boost her chest from a 32A to a 32E.

She says: ‘ I think I was the only one jumping for joy when the job losses were announced because I knew it meant I could finally afford surgery.

Jill suffered with depression for 20 years 
before a redundancy payment enabled her to pay for breast surgery, 
taking her from a 32A (right) to an 32E (left)

‘I enjoyed my job but I was over the moon to be made redundant because I knew I being able to afford surgery would change my life - and it did.

‘Before the operation all I thought about was my flat chest and how odd and masculine I looked and felt with no breast tissue.

‘As soon as I came round from surgery those feelings were gone. My depression lifted. The surgery cured me.

‘People are quick to judge those who have surgery but the change in me has affected not only my life, but also those around me to.

Jill Walker says that before having the operation she felt she had to wear padded bras the whole time simply to feel normal - here, she is pictured before surgery wearing a bust-enhancing bra

‘I finally feel free of the condition that defined me for too many years. I am happy and confident at last. The old Jill is back.’

Jill, from London, lost confidence in her body after giving birth to daughter Robyn, 22 and son Alex, 20.

The former ballet dancer said her chest grew from a 32 C to a 34E when she was expecting.

But soon after delivery her bust withered away.

She explains: ‘They shrank to practically nothing. I was left with small envelopes of skin with nipples. There was literally no breast tissue left.

‘Having been used to having a bust I felt ridiculous. I absolutely despised the way my chest looked so flat and boyish.

‘My shoulder blades were more prominent than my breasts.’

A year after her son was born Ms Walker separated from his father.

She says: ‘Being single again was awful because I had no self-confidence at all.

‘I knew the root cause of it all was how I felt about my chest but there was nothing I could do.’

Her confidence crisis was compounded when she learned a new partner had been cheating on her with several fuller-breasted women.

She says: ‘I felt less of a woman already but this just made it even worse.

‘The fact they were all big-busted women he had cheated with proved to me that I was inadequate in some way.

‘I
 knew I would never feel happy again without surgery to restore my bust - 
but there was no way I could afford it with small children.’

Jill eventually sought help from her GP but was turned down for breast surgery on the NHS because she did not meet the criteria.

She
 says: ‘I was disappointed because it was affecting my life so 
negatively. It was the first thing I thought about in the morning and 
remained on my mind all day.

‘I hated socialising, had no confidence and clothes looked awful on me.’

When she met her fiancé paramedic Ashley Tinham, 46, 12 years ago, Jill made it clear her breasts were a no-go area.

She explains: ‘ I always wore a shirt in bed and bathed with the door shut. I just didn’t want him to see my chest.’

She believed cosmetic surgery was her only real solution, but it was financially out of reach – until she was made redundant.

She says: ‘As soon as I heard the news I jumped for joy because I knew I was going to be able to have the operation at last.

‘I was over the moon. Redundancy was the best thing that ever happened to me.’

Just 12 days after receiving her payment, Jill was having surgery with Transform.

She says: ‘It sounds quick but it was not a quick decision. I had been researching it for 15 years.

‘I couldn’t wait another day.’

The operation cost £3,600 but for Jill the results have been priceless.

‘I feel like me again. It was that simple. The anxiety and stress I felt non-stop left me as soon as I had it done.

‘I was happy again for the first time in years.’

She suffered with capsular contraction, which is a common complaint after breast surgery, and needed her left implant replaced last year, but Jill has remained delighted with the results.

Jill, who now works in a textile factory, said:  ‘The surgeon was fantastic and the care and service I received was amazing. I can honestly say cosmetic surgery cured my depression and I have never been happier.’
