For the townsfolk of Zalipie, every day is a celebration since the isolated outpost blossomed into one of Poland's most iconic villages.

What was once a bleak and forgotten cluster of smoke-blackened huts, has over the years transformed into a kaleidoscopic feast of colour - and one of southern Poland's best-kept treasures.

Each house is decorated with its own vibrant floral motif, painstakingly hand-painted by the town's housewives.

No smoke! The practice dates back to when the smoke from stoves seeped outdoors through tiny holes in the walls scarring the homes with sooty black blotches

Not the white paint! The women tried to cover the marks up by whitewashing over them but many were still faintly visible through the paint

Showing their petal: So to make their homes completely 
immaculate for religious festivals, the women hid the spots behind these
intricate flower designs

The practice dates back to when the smoke from stoves filtered out through tiny vents in the roof. But over the years the areas around these ventilation holes became scarred by sooty blotches, according to the Kuriositas website.

The women tried to cover the marks up by whitewashing over them but many were still faintly visible through the paint.

Feast of colour: Now every house in the village is decorated with its own individual flower design - some that cover an entire house

Over the bridge: Even the village bridge is adorned with a floral colour scheme

Kaleidoscopic: Zalipie was once a bleak and forgotten cluster of smoke-blackened huts

Painstaking: These close ups reveal quite how intricate the designs are

Changing times: Once modern cooking and better ventilation came in to practice, these cover-ups were no longer necessary

Legend: But the villagers kept them up all the same

So to make their homes completely immaculate for religious festivals, the women hid the spots behind these intricate flower designs.

Gradually they took their designs outside, painting them on their homes for the world to see.

Now every house in the village is decorated with its own individual flower design - some that cover an entire house.

Iconic: The isolated outpost blossomed into one of Poland's most iconic villages

Complex: Over the years, the flower patterns became gradually more and more sophisticated and complex

Serious business: The village now even holds an annual painting competition around the festival of Corpus Christi

Flower crazy: Now the art has spread from houses onto almost anything in the village that can be painted, from the village bridge, to bins, outhouses and even chicken coops

Back to basics: They made the brushes from the tail hair of local cows while they used fat from their dumplings mixed with pigment to create the colours

But once modern cooking techniques and improved ventilation came in to practice, these cover-ups were no longer necessary.

But the villagers kept them up all the same.

The village now even holds an annual painting competition around the festival of Corpus Christi that sees women, and some men, compete to be crowned the village's best flower-painter.

Tradition: The competition - known as Malowana Chata ¿ has been held every year since 1948

Ubiquitous: Now the art has spread from houses onto almost anything in the village that can be painted, from the village bridge, to bins, outhouses and even chicken coops

Catharsis: The competition was introduced as part of a wider effort to help the country recover from the horrors of the Second World War, in which 17 per cent of the population died
