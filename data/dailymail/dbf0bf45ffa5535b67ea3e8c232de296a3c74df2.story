Her sweet treats have impressed the judges – but for viewers of the Great British Bake Off, it is Ruby Tandoh’s looks that are causing a stir.

The striking 21-year-old has received a flurry of compliments on Twitter from male fans.

The comments include ‘Ruby is the perfect woman’, ‘I think I’m in love’ and ‘the most gorgeous eyes I have ever seen’. But that should come as no surprise.

Miss Tandoh, chosen from 10,000 applicants to be one of this year’s 13 contestants, is a former model. In her teens, she was briefly signed to Models 1, one of the leading agencies.

Essex-born Miss Tandoh, now a philosophy and history of art student at University College London, struggled to impress Bake Off judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood at first.

This week, however, she was the show’s star baker. Miss Tandoh’s success should please BBC bosses – it will surely help boost the show’s male viewing figures.

An average of 5.3m viewers tuned in to watch 38-year-old horticulturalist Lucy Bellamy eliminated from the show on Tuesday evening.

The episode attracted a peak audience of 5.9m – 300,000 down from the opening episode last week.

Miss Tandoh has told how she was inspired to bake by the ‘rubbish’ cakes often sold on British high streets.

She said recently: ‘I became interested in baking after seeing the cakes in baker shop windows and thinking they were a bit rubbish.

‘I started baking bits and pieces as a teenager. But it wasn’t until I went to university that I really starting to learn more detailed techniques, even though there was only a tiny kitchen.

‘I make such a mess when I bake, which I don’t think my mum was very pleased about when I lived at home, so I had the freedom to make as much mess as I pleased.’
