Cars are made by professionals for good reason... it's how you know yours won't blow up when you take it for a spin.

But nobody told that to these hapless petrol heads in Russia, so they had to learn it the hard way instead.

The two men have been left deaf after their apparently home-made gas-powered car overheated in a traffic jam, and blasted the vehicle to smithereens.

Can you guess the home-made car? The two men were driving their white DIY car on the Moscow Automobile Ring Road, or MKAD, which encircles the Russian capital

In a real jam: Everything seemed to be going well as they test ran the vehicle on the motorway ... until they hit a traffic jam

You'll never tyre of watching this: As they sat in the jam, the engine overheated and exploded with such forced that it blew the car's spare tyre 30-feet into the air and blew out the windows

The spectacular explosion, which blew 
the car's spare tyre 30 foot into the air and blew out the windows, was 
captured with a dash cam on the Moscow Automobile Ring Road, or MKAD, 
which is a road encircling the Russian capital Moscow.

The blast was so powerful, it scattered debris across five lanes of traffic.

And seconds later, the driver and passenger open the doors, and stagger out onto the highway clutching their hands to their heads. Both later told medics they could hear nothing apart from a permanent ringing sound.

Moscow doctor Leo Konovalov, who treated driver Edgar Maslov, 23, and passenger Gabriel Yermolayev, 48, said: "There was a massive pressure wave in the car caused by the exploding gas.

Five lane blast: The blast was so powerful, it scattered debris across five lanes of traffic

My ears! And seconds later, the driver and 
passenger open the doors, and stagger out onto the highway clutching 
their hands to their heads

Police confirmed they were examining the vehicle that had to be towed away, and were awaiting an expert report before passing any comment

'If it was strong enough to send a heavy rubber tyre into the air, then you can imagine what it has done to the men's eardrums.

'It is too early yet to see if they will ever hear again, but the prognosis is certainly not good."
