She has millions in the bank, the world's most coveted designers on speed dial and brands practically throwing free clothes at her. 

But Kim Kardashian has been quietly championing a lesser-known brand during her time in Paris and thanks to the reality TV star's seal of approval, it looks set to become the next big thing.

The style icon, who is currently recovering from being accosted by a celebrity pest on the red carpet, has stepped out in designer label A.W.A.K.E. twice in four days.

So who's behind this little-known label and how did fashion's finest discover it? In a word: Kanye.

She must like this label! Kim Kardashian has been spotted wearing not one but two designs by label A.W.A.K.E, which is run by Russian designer and Harper's Bazaar fashion director, Natalia Alaverdian

The brand, which is actually run by Russian designer and Harper's Bazaar former fashion director, Natalia Alaverdian, was discovered online by Kim's husband, Mr West.

'He researches everything and he loves to find new talent, and he introduced me to her and told me she’s part Armenian, and so am I,' Kim told WWD. 

'I’m all about empowering other women to be successful and it’s really important to me to support designers that I believe in and friends that I believe in that are hardworking.'

Fashionable friends: Natalia, who now works as an art and photography director for the women's glossy, focuses on classic shirting, tailored coats, and dresses like the one Kim models

Natalia Alaverdian founded  A.W.A.K.E. (which stands for All Wonderful Adventures Kindle Enthusiasm) back in September 2012 and it has been championed by editors and bloggers ever since.

However, now that Kim has been spotted wearing not one, but two of the structured designs - and even co-hosted a party on the designer's behalf - it looks set to become a household name.

Natalia, who now works as an art and photography director for the women's glossy, focuses on classic shirting, tailored coats, and dresses.

She takes inspiration from  animals and characters from history, art and film, particularly from Japanese art and culture.

Speaking about her label, Natalia, who has preciously styled Dita Von Teese, said: 'My goal   is to propose a personal and distinct voice through clothing that balance conceptual, storytelling aspirations with commercial viability.'

Prepare for sell out!
