It may not be the most obvious solution to keep the flooding at bay.

But homeowner Andy Ford held back 2ft of flood water by sealing his property with plasticine.

The 32-year-old was bestowed the advice by his neighbour Tad Mandziej, who successfully protected his own home from gushing torrents using the modelling clay.

Mr Ford was horrified when a torrent breached flood gates at his 17th century cottage in Williton, Somerset.

After Mr Mandziej's suggestion of clay,
Mr Ford sealed the doors before fleeing through a window.

When he returned home the next day he was delighted to find just a few inches of water on the ground - compared to 2ft in neighbouring homes.

Mr Ford, an account manager for cheese producer Cricketer Farm, said: 'Our house was flooded 12 years ago and so the old owner had flood gates installed.

'But the water began coming over the top of them, which was horrific.

'I was outside my home wondering what I could do when my neighbour Tad came over with a sack of plasticine.

'The water was already up to my knees around the back of the house, around 18 inches deep. I quickly put the plasticine around the back porch and door frame.

'I then used it to plug gaps in the flood gates, even though it was raining, and our front door too.

'It definitely contributed to us not getting flooded like a lot of our neighbours. They had a couple of feet.'

Mr Ford and wife Emma, 30, who works part time in insurance, moved into their picturesque two-bedroomed home three years ago.

The area regularly floods in heavy rain and so many of the properties have flood gates installed outside.

The two families in Williton, West Somerset, sealed the windows and doors with the plasticine

Mr Mandziej, 70, his neighbour who brought over the sack of commercial plasticine for professional model makers, said: 'We have a very old house and outside we have air bricks and in order to stop the water getting in I just make a sheet of the plasticine and then put it around them.

'It is incredible how water tight it is. It just fills the gaps.

'I passed some to Andy after I had done my house because I saw him flailing around and complaining the water was seeping through into his house.

'I told him to try the plasticine and he did and it stopped seeping in. He pushed it in between the cracks and it stopped the water.

'We have a problem in the sense that we are very susceptible to the water just tanking up, the flood waters just stops there and doesn’t move.

'This is the third flooding I have experienced, I didn’t use the plasticine the first time but I did the last time and it worked.

'So when I saw this guy getting frantic the idea flashed back into my head.'

Water began pouring into the couple's home at around midnight on Saturday, following hours of torrential rain that battered the South West.

They fled the property with 16-month-old daughter Elizabeth after Andy sealed the door and gates.

The family are currently staying at Emma’s parents nearby as dehumidifiers dry out out their home.

Mr Ford added: 'Hopefully the damage won’t be too bad. I would never have thought of the plasticine before but it was a great idea, it certainly helped.'
