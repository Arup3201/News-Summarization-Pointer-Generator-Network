Samir Nasri welcomed back former team-mate and friend Bacary Sagna to Manchester City's training ground on Tuesday, while also introducing him to manager Manuel Pellegrini.

The champions landed the Frenchman on a free transfer from Arsenal this summer. 

But Sagna only met his team-mates and manager for the first time on Tuesday following an extended break after his involvement in the World Cup for his country.

Nasri was seen with the pair at Carrington training ground as City prepare for their Wembley showdown with Arsenal on Sunday.

The Premier League champions face the FA Cup winners in the Community Shield final this weekend.

There will be added spice to the game with Sagna potentially making his City debut and in turn facing his former side for the first time since departing this summer.

Elsewhere, one player who won't be at the Etihad Stadium for any longer is Jack Rodwell, who has joined Sunderland for £7million on a five-year deal.

Frank Lampard has also agreed a loan move to Pellegrini's side until January before he links up with new side New York City.
