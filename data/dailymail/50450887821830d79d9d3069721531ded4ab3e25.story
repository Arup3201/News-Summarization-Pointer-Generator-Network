When a staff member leaves the office for good, they might receive a 'good luck' card or a bottle of champagne.

So not many would expect the entire global workforce to be dancing around, singing 'he's the man' as they walked in on their last day.

That was the goodbye given to clothing company Net-A-Porter's departing CEO Mark Sebba,  as he arrived at the company's headquarters in Shepherd's Bush, London, for his final day.

Scroll down for video 

Farewell: Mark Sebba, who is stepping down after 11 years as CEO of fashion site Net-A-Porter, was greeted by all of his employees singing and clapping as he arrived for his final day at work

Grand entrance: He was guided through the office by a man singing a parody of Aloe Blacc's hit single 'The Man', flanked by staff members holding placards with his face on them

Boss: Some of the employees are seen standing on their desks and applaud him as he is paraded through the company's headquarters

After 11 years at the helm, he arrived through the doors of the offices in Westfield Shopping Centre to a round of applause from employees standing on either side of the corridor.

The video shows him being greeted by a man in blue robes holding a microphone, who says: 'Mark, welcome to the office. This is your world' and invites him through a double set of doors.

There, he is welcomed by the rest of his workforce, surrounded by clothes hangers, dancing to a parody of Aloe Blacc's hit single 'The Man'. 

Mr Sebba is then guided through the offices surrounded by employees as the music plays.

As he walks, he gives a thumbs up to those wearing fancy dress, and at one point throws a ball handed to him by netball players.  

As he walks alongside desks of computers, employees hold up placards reading: 'Mark Sebba. You're the man.'

At one point, he arrives at a big screen where he is shown video footage of his staff in Manhattan, New Jersey, Hong Kong and Shanghai waving and dancing.

Mr Sebba then reaches the main cluster of computers, where dancers in exotic costumes show him to his desk while a group of men play the steal drums.

When he reaches his computer, a cup of coffee is handed to him before he grabs the microphone.

He says: 'Thank you everybody. I am a bit overwhelmed. But I feel like getting back to work'.
