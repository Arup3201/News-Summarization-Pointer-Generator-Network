With the Oscars just hours away it is perhaps a good moment to remind ourselves of the anticipated form that comes with the Academy Awards. 

These awards are taken very seriously indeed – celebrating the tremendous cinematic successes of the past year. 

The Americans do take this supposed jewel in the awards season’s crown terribly seriously and perhaps one of the unspoken rules of the red carpet would be to not shatter this pretense and confuse it with the British Soap Awards.

Dame Helen Mirren took a tumble on the red carpet during the Woman In Gold premiere in Berlin earlier this month, and William isn't a fan of her 'Shrek' coloured dress

How to greet your idols

Although you may not see normal members of the public but there are some in attendance who will be forgiven for being star-struck as this year’s cannon of glitterati process into the Kodak Theatre, and even the idols have idols – the form to follow is two fold for meeting the stars. 

Firstly, if you are just Joe Public then avoid rushing over to someone. Not only will you alert security but you will look desperate and a total parvenu. Keep your cool and act cool. 

Stage a chance encounter with them instead if at all possible. Look radiant, smile and catch their eye. If you are an idol yourself then best find a mutual friend or co-star to introduce you. It is still preferable in social situations to be introduced rather than introduce yourself.

How to dress  

Fashions come and go, and we see far too many stars get it horribly wrong when it comes to their wardrobe. 

Admittedly, men have it easier with more guidelines and rules to follow than their female counterparts, but the ones who get it right are usually those who stick to tried and tested conventions, shunning an attempt to reinvent the wheel.

The dress code for the Academy Awards is Black Tie. It is never good manners to shun what the invitation says, although it’s increasingly often done. 

William was not a fan of Henry Cavill's bow tie on the red carpet at the BAFTAs which he said was wonky

Men, if you are going to wear a bow tie (as is correct) then make sure you can tie it properly and avoid looking like Henry Cavil did two weeks ago at the Baftas with a dickie-bow that looks like it’s been on the cooking sherry. 

Credit where it is due, Gerard Butler’s bow tie for 2014’s Academy Awards was a fine attempt – unlike Leonardo DiCaprio’s, which looked suspiciously ‘ready made’.

Ladies, avoid being a slave to fashion. Yes, by all means follow colours and cuts but make sure you can move, walk (and maybe even dance) in the dress. Try it on before the day and walk about a bit to make sure you look elegant and relaxed in it.

Working the red carpet

You’ve got the threads right and now the world’s gaze is upon you as you step out from your car onto the plush red passage below. 

Nothing could be more embarrassing than falling over (apart from losing to a staunch rival). Leading ladies need to make sure they can walk in their heels.

Remember that the heels shouldn’t be too high or uncomfortable – award ceremonies are not known for their brevity and you will be in these all night. Three or four inch heels will be sufficient.

Never rush down the red carpet, however shy you may be inside. Take your time and allow the lens to capture your elegance. 

Douglas Booth committed a fashion faux pas by wearing a green velvet smoking jacket to a black tie event

Etiquette expert William Hanson also instructs women on the correct way to walk in high heels

Poor old Dame Helen Mirren had a bit of stumble recently at the Berlin Film Festival – clearly reeling from the realisation that she had borrowed her costume from Princess Fiona in Shrek.

Pacing yourself down the carpet is key so the flash bulbs capture your radiance. Avoid standing still and keep changing the pose every two to four seconds. 

Over beaming grins are not becoming to the occasion – as proud as Hollywood stars may be of their pearly teeth there is no need for us to see them this evening.

Although seasoned pros will be aware of this, red carpet ingénues may forget that the red carpet is also the way out, not just the way in and it’s just as important to look your best as you egress.

The fans

As antisocial as actors can sometimes be, now is the not the time. Work that red carpet, greet fans with smiles of equal vigour, answer the questions and sign those autographs (refrain from passing comment that autographs are now a tad passé, it’s all about selfies and camera pics, dontcha know?)

Selfies

Ah yes, the selfie. Thanks to last year’s host Ellen DeGeneres’s now infamous and tediously recreated selfie there is perhaps a clunky inevitability that this bizarre way of taking a photograph will return. 

It may seem churlish to refuse to participate when asked by a fan, but one method to retain your dignity but please your fan would be to agree, but pull a pained expression during the capturing. 

People will clearly see you are uncomfortable with the whole thing and the odd expression will explain away why you don’t look very good in the snap (no one ever does).

Last year's Oscar selfie became the most famous - and star-studded - in the history of the genre

What to do if your partner is more famous than you

Is your wife, husband or significant other a little better known than you? If so, best stay side by side as you parade down the red carpet to ensure you are snapped and cash in on their fame.

Acceptable acceptance speeches

Keep it tight and bright. Don’t do a Michael Moore and use it to make some profound political point. Wrong moment, dear. 

Remember to thank who you need to thank and unless you are a known wit keep it sincere rather than attempting any humour. Most people soon forget what you said anyway so no point fretting too much over it.

Handling Oscar

In Britain it is illegal to place a stamp on an envelope with The Queen’s head the wrong way round. In America, short of anything similar, they have made it bad form to hold your trophy incorrectly (see Kevin Kline). 

The correct way is for the right hand holding the base of the trophy, left hand should be clasped around the legs.

Thank you

Finally, even if you are the talk of Tinseltown following the ceremony, thanks to picking up multiple gongs, no one is exempt from writing their bread-and-butter thank you letter the next day. Not sure who to write to? Your official host is the President of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is Cheryl Boone Isaacs… Get writing!

FOR HIM: 

Bow tie 

Don’t even think about rolling up in something pre-tied. They look awful and people won’t need a long lens in close up to spot them. A bow tie isn’t that hard to learn to tie – practice tying it on your leg, chaps.

The collar 

Winged collars have not been correct with evening dress for some time, instead they are the reserve of full evening dress (aka white tie). Turn-down stiff collar is what is required.

Jacket 

Douglas Booth may have toyed with a green velvet number at the recent Baftas (the jacket couldn’t decide if it was a smoking jacket or a dinner jacket) but stick to something in black or midnight blue and you won’t go wrong. Never remove it until you are back in your hotel room with the curtains drawn.

Socks

Make sure you wear them! There will be some spiv who decides that shunning the socks and flashing a bit of ankle instead will look bang on trend. It doesn’t and never will.

FOR HER:  

Bag 

You don’t see many bags on the red carpet (they usually get carried by a nearby flunky) but the form is usually a clutch bag. These look elegant but can be a total pain for the Governor’s Ball afterwards where you may have to juggle finger food, a drink as well as shaking hands. A small evening bag with a thin strap will serve you better.

Wardrobe malfunctions

Any dress that has to use toupee tape and other sticky trickery is perhaps best not worn to an event where hundreds of cameras will be pointed at you. Avoid pandering to fashion and opt for something that is less likely to leave you red-faced.

Heels

It’s a formal evening affair, which calls for closed-toe shoes. Leave those peep-toed sling backs at home. Heels can be longer as it’s a nighttime event but nothing over three or four inches, please. It’s for the best.
