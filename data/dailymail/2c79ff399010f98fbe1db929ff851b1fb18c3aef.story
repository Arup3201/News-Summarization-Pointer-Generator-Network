Susie Wolff will make motorsport history later this month when she becomes the first female to compete in the Race of Champions.

The traditional end-of-season event features drivers and riders from all forms of motorsport, both four wheels and two, racing in a number of different vehicles.

Wolff, last week named as Williams test driver for the 2015 Formula One season, is to join forces with fellow Scot David Coulthard for the Nations Cup part of the competition that takes place at the Bushy Park Circuit in Barbados on December 13-14.

Wolff will team up with David Coulthard in the Nations Cup part of the competition later in December 

'Any driver would love to be invited to do the Race of Champions,' said Wolff.

'It's an event I've always looked closely at and always dreamed of being part of, so I'm proud to have been chosen.

'But the biggest thing is the fact I'm just so looking forward to racing again.

'I have a full-time job at Williams which is great, but it's about getting that adrenalin of racing back, and that's what I'm looking forward to most.'
