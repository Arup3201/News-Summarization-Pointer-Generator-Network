Christmas trees are already on sale despite there being almost 40 days until the big day (file picture)

There are almost 40 days still to go, but major retail chains have started selling real Christmas trees.

The move goes against the advice of experts who recommend waiting until at least the first week of December to buy a real tree, and then keeping it away from radiators to ensure it hasn’t faded to a twig by Christmas Day. 

The usual peak for sales is seven to 10 days before Christmas.

Retailers are always keen to bring forward the festive trading period in any way they can. 

However, 10 Tesco and 35 Dobbies Garden Centre stores have been selling pot grown trees for the past two weeks and began selling cut trees yesterday. Trees grown in a pot from seedling stage last longer as they have a fully formed root system.

Some Asda and B&Q stores started selling real trees at the weekend.

Shoppers have a choice of the traditional Norway Spruce, which is renowned for quickly drying out and dropping its needles, together with the more expensive Nordmann Fir and the luxuriant Fraser Fir, which will last longer. 

The official advice on the website of the British Christmas Tree Growers Association reads: ‘It is suggested that trees should not be purchased earlier than December 1.’

Shopper Sarah Taylor, who noticed Asda selling trees at a store in Clapham, said: ‘If you put a Christmas trees up now in a house with central heating it will be dead in a few weeks. By Christmas it will look like a stick.

‘All the needles will drop or the branches will droop in a few weeks and we have about five and a half weeks to go before Christmas Day. How are you supposed to defy nature? A tree will be dead by Christmas.

‘We haven’t even got to the first Sunday in Advent. Why are people buying them now? It’s miles too early, you’ll have to buy another one in a few weeks to make sure it looks good for Christmas.’

She added: ’It’s all rubbish and one-upmanship. It’s nothing to do with Christmas if you have the tree now. Why is it getting earlier and earlier?’

Harry Brightwell, of the BCTGA, said the useful life of a cut tree depends on the variety and how it is cared for.

‘The Nordmann Fir tends to last longer than the Norway Spruce,’ he said.

‘It is a bit like buying a bunch of daffodils. Most people can tell the difference between a nice fresh bunch and some that have been sitting around for a while. It is the same with a tree.

‘To prolong the life, it is a good idea to cut half an inch off the bottom and leave it outside to stand in a bucket of water for while so it can drink in the water. You then need to put it into a stand where you can top it up with water every day.

‘You wouldn’t put a bunch of flowers next to a radiator and you should adopt the same policy with a Christmas tree, otherwise it will dry out.’

He added: ‘The earlier you buy a tree the more difficult it is. After all, it is a cut plant. Our advice would be to wait to get a Christmas tree until the first week in December and try and make sure it is freshly cut. Try keeping it topped up with water and cool.’ 

Many families have switched to artificial trees in recent years on the basis these can be re-used. At the same time they are cheaper than spending anything from £20 to £50 on a real tree.

The Carbon Trust says a real tree can be ‘greener’ than an artificial one. It estimates that a two metre artificial tree has a carbon footprint of around 40kg of carbon dioxide, in terms of the energy involved in manufacture and transport, which is more than twice that of a real tree that ends its life in landfill, and more than ten times that of real trees that are burnt.

Mr Brightwell said around six million real trees are sold in the UK every year and this figure appears to be holding up.

‘For many families the tradition of going out to buy the Christmas tree creates memories that last a lifetime. Very few people reminisce about getting the artificial tree out of the loft,’ he said.
