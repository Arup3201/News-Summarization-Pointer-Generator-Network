Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has extended an olive branch to Pakistan's prime minister in America's latest bid to address strained relations between the two countries.

It comes exactly one week after the NATO bombing that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers along the Afghanistan border in an apparent case of mistaken identity.

Following the attack, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said his county is re-evaluating its relationship with the United States.

Peace offering: U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke with Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani to offer her condolences for the 'unintended' deaths of 24 Pakistani soldiers

But on Saturday Clinton spoke with the Pakistani leader to express condolences to the soldiers' families and to the Pakistani people.

A statement from the U.S. State Department said Clinton 'once again expressed condolences to the families of the soldiers and to the Pakistani people for the tragic and unintended loss of life.

'She reiterated America's respect for Pakistan's sovereignty and commitment to working together in pursuit of shared objectives on the basis of mutual interest and mutual respect.'

She had hoped Pakistan would attend an international conference on Afghanistan scheduled for Monday in Germany.

The country's attendance at the conference had been considered essential to ensure stability in the region stands a chance.

But a government official told the AFP news agency: 'The cabinet has decided not to attend the Bonn meeting.'

Pakistan refused to join in the U.S. 
investigation of the bombing and has moved to shut down supply lines the
U.S. uses to get food, fuel and equipment to troops in Afghanistan.

Last week U.S. military 
reports suggested Nato forces may have been lured into attacking 
friendly Pakistani border posts in a calculated manoeuvre by the 
Taliban.

The attack - which Pakistan claims went on for almost two hours and continued even after soldiers had pleaded with forces to stop - marked the deadliest friendly fire incident with Pakistan since the Afghanistan war began.

A joint U.S.-Afghan patrol was attacked by the Taliban last weekend.

While
pursuing the Taliban in the poorly-marked border area, the patrol is 
said to have mistaken one of the Pakistan troop outposts for a militant 
encampment and called in a Nato gunship and attack helicopters to open 
fire.

U.S. officials, 
speaking on condition of anonymity, claim the reports suggest the 
Taliban may have deliberately tried to provoke a cross-border fire-fight
that would set back fragile partnerships between the U.S. and Nato 
forces and Pakistani soldiers at the ill-defined border.

The incident sent the perpetually difficult U.S.-Pakistan relationship into a tailspin.

General
James Mattis, head of U.S. Central Command, announced he has 
appointed Brigadier General Stephen Clark, an Air Force special 
operations officer, to lead the probe into the incident.

Brigadier
General Clark has been ordered to include input from the Nato-led 
forces in Afghanistan, as well as representatives from the Afghan and 
Pakistani governments.

According
to the U.S. military records described to news agency the Associated 
Press, the joint U.S. and Afghan patrol requested back-up after being 
hit by mortar and small arms fire by Taliban militants.

Before
responding, the joint U.S.-Afghan patrol first checked with the 
Pakistani army, which reported it had no troops in the area, the 
military account said.

Some
two hours later, still hunting the insurgents - who had by then 
apparently fled in the direction of Pakistani border posts - the U.S. 
commander spotted what he thought was a militant encampment, with heavy 
weapons mounted on tripods.

The
joint patrol called for the air-strikes at around 2.21am local time, 
not realising the encampment was apparently the Pakistani border post.

Records show the aerial response included Apache attack helicopters and an AC-130 gunship.

U.S.
officials are working on the assumption the Taliban chose the location 
for the first attack to create confusion and draw U.S. and Pakistani 
forces into firing on each other, it is claimed.

At
the White House, spokesman Jay Carney said President Barack Obama 
considers the Pakistani deaths a tragedy, and said the administration is
determined to investigate.

The
Pentagon released a four-page memo from General Mattis directing 
Brigadier General Clark to determine what happened, which units were 
involved, which ones did or did not cross the border, how the operation 
was coordinated, and what caused the deaths and injuries.

Brigadier
General Clark must also develop recommendations about how border 
operations could be improved. His final report must be submitted by 
December 23.

The details of
the air-strike emerged as aftershocks were last night reverberating 
across the U.S. military and diplomatic landscape, threatening 
communications and supply lines for the Afghan war and the success of an
upcoming international conference.

While
U.S. officials expressed regret and sympathy over the cross-border 
incident, they are not acknowledging blame, amid conflicting reports 
about who fired first.

Attack: Nato helicopters similar to this one opened fire on the Pakistani army checkpoint close to its border with Afghanistan

In
recent weeks, military leaders had begun expressing some optimism that 
U.S.-Pakistan military cooperation along the border was beginning to 
improve.

Just two weeks ago,
U.S. Army Major General Daniel Allyn told Pentagon reporters that 
incidents of firing from Pakistan territory had tapered off somewhat in 
recent weeks.

Pentagon press secretary George Little last week stressed the need for a strong military relationship with Pakistan.

He
said: 'The Pakistani government knows our position on that, and that is
we do regret the loss of life in this incident, and we are 
investigating it.'

The military fallout began almost immediately.

Pakistan
has blocked vital supply routes for U.S.-led troops in Afghanistan and 
demanded Washington vacate a base used by American drones. Pakistan 
ordered CIA employees to mothball their drone operation at Pakistan's 
Shamsi air base within two weeks, a senior Pakistani official said. The 
officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence 
matters.
