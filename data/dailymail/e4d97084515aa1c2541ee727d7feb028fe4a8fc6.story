A gang of squatters have been accused of making their neighbours lives 'a living hell' for four years - but can't be evicted because of a legal loophole.

The squatters, believed to be eastern European, keep locals up all night by playing bongo drums and dump piles of rubbish in their street in Streatham, south London.

But police have been left powerless to boot them out because the building is classed as commercial property.

Neighbours say the squatters sit on the roof and make noise, making their lives a misery

New laws introduced last year which allow squatters to be jailed for six months only cover residential properties.

Angry locals have branded powers to evict squatters 'pointless' and 'stupid' and demanded the government reform the law.

Richard and Philomena Chadwick, whose house backs on to the squat, have lived in the road for 40 years but say their lives have been blighted by the constant noise coming from the property.

Mr Chadwick, 71, a retired local government housing officer, said: 'They have made our lives a living misery, we hear banging and crashing all through the night.

'It is a living hell. My wife and I are pensioners now and we have to put up with all the rubbish they dump outside.

'They play their bongo drums into the night and sunbathe on the roof overlooking our garden. It's a massive invasion of privacy. We can't even go into our back garden anymore.

'The whole area is being held to ransom by these squatters. The council, the police, there is nothing they can do. The squatters have more rights than we've got.'

Last August the law was changed to make squatting a criminal offence in residential properties, but not commercial ones.

Mr Chadwick said the squatters were well versed in the legal loophole and were 'playing the system'.

He said: 'The law is an ass. It is totally toothless. We pay our taxes but they don't. If they want to stay somewhere they should pay their way.

'These squatters are mainly eastern European and they have convertible cars out the front. They have money. They are playing the system.

'I think the government is embarrassed because the law is stupid. But we need action.'

Around 15 people live in the ex-factory, where they blare out loud music, drum all night long and loiter on their neighbours' garden walls.

Mr Chadwick's son, Paul, 36, who lives with his parents while studying for a Masters degree in music, said: 'They have caused quite a lot of aggro.

'They bang on their tribal drums beyond midnight.

'They should pay their way like the rest of society, I don't see any reason why they should get free room and board.

'They get up on the roof and sunbathe and drum. It is not the kind of thing you want to see from your bedroom. It's a nuisance.'

Susan Bristol, 53, who lives opposite, said: 'You can hear the music through my double glazing. It's not even our own people who are using it.'

Constituency Labour MP Chuka Umunna has called for a change in the law and said it was 'unfair' for the squatters to be living there for free during a 'cost of living crisis'.

Developer and architect Mike Moxley, whose company owns the site and still pays rates on it, cannot enter the property legally after squatters changed the locks. He said: 'I want them out.'

But the squatters remain defiant, with one saying: 'We're not doing anything wrong. This is commercial property.'
