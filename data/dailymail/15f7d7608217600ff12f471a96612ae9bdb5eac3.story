West Ham are chasing Manchester City defender Micah Richards, who is set to leave the Barclays Premier League champions this summer.

Hammers boss Sam Allardyce is in the market for a new right-back and has identified the versatile defender as a potential summer signing.

Richards looks likely to leave the Etihad Stadium this summer following a frustrating season under Manuel Pellegrini.

Moving on: Micah Richards (centre) is set to quit City after growing tired of not playing regularly

The 25-year-old is at a crossroads in his career given he has just 12 months left on his current deal.

City have offered Richards a contract extension, but the full-back has shown a reluctance to sign the deal given his lack of action under Pellegrini.

The champions are desperate to keep their British stars at the club, Richards being one, as they struggle to fulfill homegrown quota regulations and have not given up hope of persuading the defender to stay.

But City know Richards can leave the club
 on a free transfer next season when his contract expires, a scenario 
they want to avoid.

Heading north: Bacary Sagna is currently with France at the World Cup but is expected to join City soon

Richards' chances under Pellegrini will be even more limited next term due to the pending arrival of Bacary Sagna.

West Ham's interest, which is at an early stage, will be dependent on the cost of the deal.

Despite having only 12 months left City could demand upwards of £5million for the defender, while his current £70,000-per-week wages could also prove a stumbling block.
