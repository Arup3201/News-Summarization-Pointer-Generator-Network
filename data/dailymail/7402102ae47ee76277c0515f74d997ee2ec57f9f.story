Happy: Diana Bianchi, 29, who was at the centre of the Brinkley-Cook divorce, has married  Aaron Arizpe

Diana Bianchi has now married food writer Aaron Arizpe from New York, and changed her last name.

'She was just a kid when [her affair with Cook] happened,' a family friend told the New York Post.

'She was a teenager. But things change, people change, they mature. She couldn't be happier now, and we're really happy for her.'

Bianchi, who was the daughter of the Brinkley-Cooks' neighbour, had a year-long affair with Cook which started in 2005 when Bianchi was 18 years old and working as his assistant.

Brinkley was told of the affair in 2007 and ended their ten-year marriage which saw her and Cook embark on a very public court battle.

During the 2008 divorce, the court was told that Cook had paid Bianchi $300,000 in the hope she would keep the liaison quiet.

The 60-year-old supermodel gained sole custody of their daughter Sailor, now 16, and 19-year-old Jack, the son of her ex Richard Taubman but  later adopted by Peter Cook.
