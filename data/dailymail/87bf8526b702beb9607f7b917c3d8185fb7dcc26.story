The mistress of the Mormon doctor accused of killing his wife has revealed how they exchanged 22 text messages with him throughout her funeral.

Gypsy Willis began giving her testimony on Friday afternoon and told how her relationship with the married pediatrician progressed from their first interaction online a year before his wife's death to the point where he paid for her apartment, gave her a debit card for spending money and helped pay her nursing school tuition.

Willis, who appeared in court as part of a plea deal to get a lesser sentence for felony identity theft charges that she currently faces, tried to downplay the seriousness of her relationship with Martin MacNeill.

Out in public: Gypsy Willis testified about how she first met Martin MacNeill when he contacted her through an online interest board that she ran and they began instant messaging

Tense: Martin MacNeill remained expressionless throughout the trial on Friday

She said that they first met when he commented on a post she had published on an website dedicated to her interests, and they struck up an instant messaging conversation that turned into more.

While on the stand, she admitted that she had previously lied about how they met, but asserted that this version was the truth.

She repeatedly said that even though she lived in a duplex that he controlled the contract to, they kept their sexual relationship very loose after first making contact in November 2005.

It became sexual in January 2006- a year and three months before MacNeill's wife Michele was found dead in their bathtub.

'We would see each other about a couple of times a month but there were some months where we didn't see each other,' Willis said in her testimony.

'It was a very casual thing.'

She said that she was still seeing other people while maintaining this relationship with MacNeill and continued that level of seriousness even after she moved into a complex where he had an apartment that was not being used.

Looking over the facts: The prosecutor asked Willis to read out the number of texts they exchanged for a wide swath of days during the relationship, including throughout the week that his wife was found dead

Getting ready: Willis, seen walking into court in Provo, Utah on Friday, said that their relationship was very casual and had been sexual for more than a year before his wife was found dead in their family home

Willis was a nursing student at the time, and although part of her tuition was being paid for by financial aid, MacNeill also helped her with the additional payments- though she said in court today that those financial entanglements had no reflection on whether or not their relationship was serious.

'I was still seeing other people, I was 
very busy so the fact that i did see him a little more than other 
peopleâ€™ was insignificant.

Motives: Willis agreed to testify as part of a plea deal for an ongoing felony identity theft case

After repeatedly saying that she kept things casual with the married father, the prosecutor had her read out an email that she sent on March 7, 2007 to an unnamed potential suitor where she put an end to that man's advances because of MacNeill.

In the March 7 email she wrote saying that she could not see the man in question because 'a very good and best friend of mine has become much more than that,' referring to MacNeill.

In a follow up to that same man, she expanded on it and said that even though they met online more than a year ago, 'just recently his reasoning and views changed and we are together now'.

The prosecutor then went through the log of texts and calls that the pair exchanged, that ranged from anywhere between six and 38 texts in one day- even during the week of April 11, 2007 when Michele was found dead.

On that particular day, they exchanged 15 texts, and on April 14 they texted 22 times during Michele's funeral.

The majority of the calls were made from MacNeill's office phone while the texts came from his cell- showing that he tried to keep his audible interactions with her hidden while at home with his wife and children.

'This was a very informal, discrete 
thing. We were not interested in other people knowing. He was trying to 
keep it discrete. I respected that,' Willis said.

Asked about the nature of the relationship she added: 'We had sex half the time. Sometimes, it was just lunch.'

Friday's
appearance was Gypsy's first time taking the stand in the controversial
murder trial, and she only spoke briefly about the circumstances around
Michele's death.

When asked what MacNeill had told her about the way in which his wife had died, she said: 'He found Michele in the bathtub.'

'I didn't chase him for details but I believe she was partially dressed,' she said.

Willis recalled two other potentially pivotal details, telling how she remembered an undated anecdote that MacNeill told her about how his wife had recently been told by doctors that she had high blood pressure.

Willis also said that on the day of Michele's death, she remembered MacNeill telling her he had called one of his older daughters- Alexis- and asked her to check in on her mother because Michele had seemed 'restless' that morning.

The secret lovers became less and less discrete after Michele's death, however, as Gypsy attended her funeral on April 14 and spoke to him briefly immediately after the service in front of family and friends.

She went on to say how some time after the funeral, he 'staged and directed' her first meeting with a few of his daughters at a Mormon temple by making sure she was dressed appropriately and steering the conversation into one about their need for a nanny.

In front of his daughter, he asked Gypsy for her phone number- even though he clearly already had it- and arranged for an interview at his house to see if she would be a good fit for the nanny job.

Willis, now 37, will return to the stand on Tuesday.

The prosecution is trying to prove a case that supports the theory that MacNeill killed his wife by using a combination of drugs following a plastic surgery operation in order to be with his mistress.
