Help: Sordell is being supported over his prodigious use of Facebook and Twitter, which has seen him targeted by online trolls

A footballer who received abuse on Twitter after reporting racist chanting is getting advice after becoming hooked on social media.

Wanderers' manager Dougie Freedman revealed that Bolton Wanderers striker Marvin Sordell  was being advised about his excessive use of Twitter and Facebook, which he said bordered on 'an obsession'.

Freedman, speaking on BBC Radio Manchester this morning, added that the 21-year-old had found it difficult to settle since moving to the Lancashire club from Watford last February.

Bolton were alerted to Sordell's problems after he tweeted how he and team-mates had been racially abused during a match at Millwall in October.

The London club later banned a 13-year-old boy, prompting Twitter trolls to target Sordell with more racist abuse.

In November he was allegedly called a 'jungle ape' by Twitter user Steve Lawrence, who also reportedly criticised Mr Sordell for 'crying like a sissy' following the abuse he received from the Millwall fan.

He also tweeted:'blacks and whites: obviously not the same because whites do not cry like sissies and fairies when they are booed by pre-teens'.

In response, Mr Sordell tweeted: 'racism and homophobia all in one tweet. Well done, does that make you feel important or big?'

After Sordell reported the abuse to police, six Millwall fans were arrested at their home game with Derby in November for unfurling a banner bearing the words "Sordell is a c***."

In November Bolton captain Kevin Davies urged him to quit Twitter. He said: 'If it was me, I would advise not to go on it.

'What are you gaining out of it as a 21/22-year-old? I don’t know. When it gets to a point where you are getting abuse I think it can play on your mind and affect you.

'If you are not sleeping at night wondering what you are going to wake up to, I don’t think you gain anything from being on there.'

But Sordell has showed his determination to stand up to online abuse, tweeting to his 23,400 Twitter followers: 'No chance im gonna leave twitter. Theres a lot of good to be done through using it.'

But Freedman said that he wanted to address Sordell's problems with internet trolls.

'There is an issue there and it will be dealt with.'

Sordell, whose Twitter and Facebook accounts have since been suspended, scored in Bolton's 2-2 draw with Sunderland in their FA Cup tie on Saturday.
