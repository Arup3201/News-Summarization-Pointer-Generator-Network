When you think of French food, smelly cheese and grapes are probably the first things that come to mind.

As is pasta at the mention of Italian cuisine, or curry when asked about Indian gastronomy.

So it's not hard to see why these commonly associated foods have been plated up alongside others to recreate some of the world's national flags in a collection of photographs.

The Union Jack is represented here by scone, cream and different coloured jams in a tribute to the British tradition of afternoon tea

National treasure: The Australian flag is created with meat pie and sauce, with star shaped holes lending themselves to the flag's more detailed sections

Britain is synonymous with scone, cream and different coloured jams, with the Union Jack depicted by some of the highlights of afternoon tea, while America's Star Spangled Banner is perfectly animated by hot dogs and dots of mustard to represent the flag's 50 stars.

The Australian company behind the images 
chose meat pie and sauce to represent its home nation, making sure to 
cut out star-shaped holes in the pie's crust to stick to the flag's 
design while France's Tricoleur is completed by brie, blue cheese and 
grapes.

Basil, pasta and tomatoes, three of the most common ingredients used in Italian cuisine are used to bring the country's flag to life

Sushi solution: Raw tuna and rice is used to represent the Japanese flag

Basil, pasta and tomatoes, three of 
the most common ingredients in Italian cuisine are used to represent the
country's green, white and red flag, while Japan's well known red dot 
is formed by raw tuna on a bed of rice.

Olives
and feta cheese celebrate their Greek origins and spicy orange and red 
curries remind viewers of Indian and Indonesian flavours.

Viva Espana: Chorizo and Paella rice neatly make up the Spanish civil flag. The Spanish national flag features the country's coat of arms

Switzerland is represented with charcuterie meats and Emmental cheese

Indonesia's national flag is created with spicy curry and white rice

Spain's civil flag is identified by its chorizo and paella rice.

More adventurous creations are seen in Thailand's blue swimmer crab, 
shredded coconut and sweet chilli sauce - three local delicacies that 
are best served separately perhaps.

Unsurprisingly, Turkish delight was used to represent it's national namesake as was Swiss cheese, often known as Emmental.

More
exotic foods were sourced for the display such as South Korean kimbap, 
which resembles Japanese sushi but uses sesame oil to flavour rice 
rather than vinegar.

Lebanese lavash, a soft, thin flatbread, is served with fattoush which is a bread salad made of sliced pita and vegetables.

A taste of India: India's colourful flag brightens up the plate with curry, rice, vegetables and poppadum

Ahead
of the Sydney International Food Festival, the company has released 
photographs of their efforts which cleverly serve up 17 national flags 
made entirely from international delicacies. 

The
agency, WHYBIN/TBWA, is making preparations ahead of the festival's 
opening in October, when hundreds of thousands are expected to gather to
celebrate global cuisine for a whole month.

The festival is the largest of its 
kind in Australia and attracted close to 1million foodies last year. Its
highlights are the Night Noodle Market and Breakfast on Bondi which 
invites enthusiasts to the most important meal of the day on the fames 
stretch of beach.
