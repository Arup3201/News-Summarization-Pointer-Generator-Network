Bagged salads have been linked to a food poisoning outbreak that could have infected as many as 3,000 people, it has been revealed today.

Details of the contamination, which was caused by the water born parasite Cryptosporidium, were released by the Health Protection Agency (HPA).

The outbreak happened in May last year, however the details of the investigation and the likely source have only been released now.

The Health Protection Agency have also linked bags of mixed salad, similar to the one pictured right, sold in some Morrisons stores to the outbreak but the supermarket have strenuously denied the claims

Significantly, the contamination appears to have occurred in bags of washed mixed salad, which were marked as ready to eat.

The HPA said its investigation suggested a statistically significant link to bags of mixed salad leaves sold by the Morrisons chain in Yorkshire and the Humber, the North East, the Midlands and Scotland.

There was also some evidence pointing towards salad spinach leaves sold by Asda.

However, the HPA said all the supermarkets tend to get their salad leaves from the same suppliers and other retailers may well have been implicated.

The investigation concentrated on interviewing people who fell ill and looking for common eating patterns. No contaminated bags of salad, which have a short shelf life, were found.

Some 300 people, mainly women aged over 20, reported falling ill with stomach upsets and diarrhoea to their GPs. However, the HPA believes the total number of cases is likely to be ten times higher, with most people simply putting up with the symptoms.

Cryptosporidium is most often found in water contaminated with animal faeces, such as sheep dung.

The HPA’s Dr Stephen Morton, who led the investigation, which also involved the Food Standards Agency (FSA), said: ‘Our findings suggest that eating mixed leaf bagged salad was the most likely cause of illness.

‘It is however often difficult to identify the source of short lived outbreaks of this type as by the time that the outbreak can be investigated, the affected food and much of the microbiological evidence may no longer be available.

‘As this was an isolated and short lived outbreak there is no specific action for the public to take but we hope the investigations between the FSA and the food industry will help to prevent further outbreaks of this type from happening again.’

Director of food safety at the FSA, Dr Alison Gleadle, said she believed this was an isolated incident and that, generally, consumers can trust labels which describe salads and other products as ready to eat.

‘We’d like to remind everyone of our 
usual advice to wash all fruits and vegetables, including salad, before 
you eat them, unless they are labelled "ready-to-eat",’ she said.

‘It’s
also important to wash hands thoroughly as well as clean chopping 
boards, knives and other utensils between preparing raw and ready-to-eat
foods to prevent cross contamination.’

Morrisons
denied any involvement in the Cryptosporidium outbreak. It said the 
HPA’s investigation had come to the wrong conclusion.

It
said: ‘Morrisons is not the source of this outbreak. We have received 
no complaints of illness and no Morrisons products have tested positive 
for Cryptosporidia.

‘Morrisons
shares the same supply chain used for its bagged salads with several 
other retailers, meaning they would also have been affected by this 
outbreak.

‘The HPA appears to be concerned with making an eye catching announcement before being disbanded in two weeks’ time.‘

Asda also denied any involvement in the food poisoning, saying: ‘The HPA research is statistically flawed and does not prove that Asda is the source of the outbreak.

‘Product safety is our top priority and if we had any serious concerns we'd act immediately. So far this hasn't been necessary.’
