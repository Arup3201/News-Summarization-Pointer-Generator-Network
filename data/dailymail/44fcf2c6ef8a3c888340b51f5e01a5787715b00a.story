Police say a Massachusetts woman allowed her 2-year-old daughter to drink her margarita at a restaurant and poured some of it into the girl's sippy cup.

Sheldy Nelson, 41, of Lynn, pleaded not guilty on Thursday to a child endangerment charge in Salem District court in connection with the August incident. She was held on $1,000 bond.

A waitress at Brodies Seaport told police Nelson ignored two warnings from staff to stop giving her daughter sips. Both the woman and girl appeared lethargic, and they were taken to a hospital.

Charged: Sheldy Nelson, 41, is accused of giving her two-year-old daughter some margarita from her sippy cup 

Nelson allegedly told the waitress she was just pouring ice from her drink into her child's cup but waitresses claim that they saw Nelson giving the girl sips from her drink.

The hospital found alcohol in the toddler's system. Police found a sippy cup in Nelson's bag that smelled of alcohol.

The Salem News  reports that Nelson's lawyer asked that his client be released on personal recognizance.

The girl is now state custody.

According to Salem News, during supervised visit on September 19 in Lynn Nelson became angry when a social worker entered the room. 

She supposedly began undressing her child and then began shaking her violently, nearly causing the girl’s head to hit a wall.

Nelson was arrested and charged with child endangerment following the incident.

Kicked out: Waitresses say they kicked Sheldy Nelson out of this  Salem restaurant after they spotted her giving her young daughter some of her alcohol
