The case against a 10-year-old Pennsylvania boy accused of fatally beating a 90-year-old woman has been moved to juvenile court.

The Times-Tribune reports that Monday's ruling came after a prosecution psychiatrist testified the boy would benefit most from treatment in the juvenile system.

Facing an adult charge, the ten-year-old was housed in an adult jail in the months following the Oct. 11 beating and killing of 90-year-old Helen Novak at the home of the boy's grandfather, Novak's caretaker.

Wayne County chief public defender Scott Bennett has said there's 'no real question' the boy beat Novak. The boy reportedly lost his temper after the woman yelled at him. 

Martha Virbitsky, the boy's mother, who took him to police barracks later that day, said the boy told her 'he got mad, lost his temper and grabbed a cane and put it around Novak's throat,' police said.

Authorities said the boy told police that he held Novak down on the bed and punched her several times in the stomach and throat. 

He was charged as an adult with criminal homicide and held away from the general population at Wayne County's adult jail. 

The attorney who initially represented the fifth grader asked to have the boy released into the custody of his father or moved to a juvenile detention facility.

However, the New York Daily News reports that the boy's family did not want him home. 

The attorney said the boy's parents were 'an emotional wreck' and did not feel comfortable with having the boy in their custody.

The other option, moving the boy to a juvenile detention facility, would make it more difficult for the boy's parents to visit him -- the closest facility is more than 70 miles away. 

The Daily News reports that the family believes the boy was being treated well in the county prison, however, detectives say they found a note in the boy's cell with 'How to Escape' written on it. 

The judge who decided to move the boy was also faced with the decision of whether or not to move the boy to a mental health facility, WNEP reports. 

Bennett says the boy needs mental health help. It wasn't immediately clear where he'll be housed next.
