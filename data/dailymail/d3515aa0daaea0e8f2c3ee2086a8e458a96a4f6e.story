Pledge: Theresa May will not support the move to create an EU-wide prosecutor

Theresa May pledged yesterday to boycott Brussels plans for an EU prosecutor and ‘European police force’.

The Home Secretary said the UK will not participate in a proposal to create a prosecutor with jurisdiction to pursue cases across the European Union.

And she said Britain would oppose any move to expand the Europol system of co-operation into a Europe-wide police force.

Her intervention comes as ministers brace themselves for a Tory rebellion tonight over plans to keep Britain in the controversial EU arrest warrant system.

Mrs May announced last week that Britain will opt out of 133 EU justice and home affairs powers before opting back in to 35, including the arrest warrant.

Many Tories are unhappy at the move, although tonight’s rebellion over the opt-out is likely to be muted after Mrs May agreed to give MPs more time before a final decision on opting back in.

On Wednesday the European Commission will announce plans for a prosecutor’s office whose powers will, initially, be limited to ‘investigation, prosecution and bringing to justice of offences affecting the EU budget’.

Many Tories see the move as the thin end of the wedge.

But in an interview yesterday, Mrs May insisted: ‘We are completely and utterly opposed to the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor or anything that heads in that direction.

'We will make sure Britain does not participate and will not come under the jurisdiction of any such prosecutor.'

May say no Force be with us: The UK will boycott the proposal to expand the Europol system of co-operation into a Europe-wide police force, the Home Secretary promised

‘Likewise, we will not have anything to do with any proposals to turn Europol into something akin to a European police force,' she added.

Tory grandee Kenneth Clarke will today join Lord Mandelson and Lib Dem Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander at the launch of a pro-EU manifesto by the group British Influence.

They will insist that leaving the EU would be a ‘historical error’ and argue that David Cameron is wrong to try to repatriate powers from Brussels.

But they will concede it is time for Brussels to call time on its vision of ‘ever-closer union’.
