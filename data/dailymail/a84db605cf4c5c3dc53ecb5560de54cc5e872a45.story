An 18-year-old beauty queen who had to give up her title after being arrested for throwing homemade bombs had her first court appearance today.

Kendra McKenzie Gill, was charged with four second-degree felony counts of possession of an explosive device when she appeared in a Salt Lake City court.

Three friends of the teenager, who gave up her Miss Riverton title and the $2,000 scholarship that went with it after her arrest, are also facing the same charges.

Court date: Former Miss Riverton Kendra Gill, pictured in court today, is charged with throwing homemade bombs

Gill, along with Bryce Christopher Stone, Shanna Marie Smith and John Patrick Reagh, could face up to 15 years in prison, according to the Salt Lake Tribune.

The friends are accused of throwing bombs made from household materials they bought at Wal-Mart at the homes and drives of their friends.

They claim the devices, made from plastic bottles, toilet cleaner and aluminum foil, were part of a prank they were playing on other friends.

Prosecutor Blake Nakamara told Fox 13: 'What we charged them with was something reflective of what they did. We didn’t feel the need, for instance, to put the gang enhancement and to charge everything we possibly could.'

Friends of the teenagers' families however, believe the youngsters are being harshly punished for a childish prank in which no one was injured.

Travis Reginek, one of Gill's neighbors, said: 'I think it’s just ridiculous. They should have had some community service, had some misdemeanor charge against them, a small $50 or $100 fine, let them go explain the importance of safety to elementary schools.'

The former beauty queen has already expressed remorse for the prank, stepping down from her recently awarded title of Miss Riverton.

Speaking with KSL-TV and the Desert News, Gill said: 'I just thought that it would be best for the city of Riverton and all the people affected by our decision and my choice to just step down and resign from my position and let someone else take it from here.'

A 'stupid' mistake: Gill started crying as she explained her reasons for stepping down from her position

Kendra McKenzie Gill, 18-year-old Utah beauty contest winner, was arrested on felony charges for throwing bombs

Giving up her title: Gill said it took hard work to win the title of Miss Riverton, and the $2,000 scholarship that comes with it, so giving it all up was a difficult decision

All four teenagers have previously acknowledged they were throwing the homemade bombs 'to scare some of their other friends,' Unified Fire Authority investigator Steve Bowen said in a court affidavit.

'We don't really understand a clear reason for their behavior,' prosecutor Blake Nakamura said earlier this month. 'The reason we charged them is obviously, what they possessed was indeed explosives, and we're alleging they were throwing them near homes and at people, and therefore, had the potential to cause a great deal of harm.'

Gill is charged with manufacturing home-made bombs which her and three other teenagers threw from a moving car and people and homes

Scene: The teens were found to have thrown the bombs at two residences, including that pictured, in Riverton

Gill called the act a 'stupid mistake' but that she and her friends never aimed the bombs at anyone.

'We didn’t think about what we were doing at the time,' she said. 'We didn’t know that it would get to this point. We meant for it to be a practical joke and never had any intentions to harm anyone at all.'

No one was injured in the incident, but that didn't get the teenagers off the hook.

'They were throwing them at both property and people,' Unified Fire Authority Captain Clint Mecham told KUTV-TV. 'This goes well beyond a teenage prank.'

'They're very caustic, very nasty. So they can cause injury to somebody just if the chemicals get on somebody, much less the fragmentation of the shrapnel damage that can be caused,' Captain Mecham told the television station. 'They can very easily cause serious harm or even death.'

Gill had just been crowned Miss Riverton and was supposed to go on to compete for the Miss Utah title before her arrest

On her side: Gill's attorney, left, thinks the charges are overkill. Her parents Michelle, second from right, and Gavin, right, defended their daughter's actions

Gill's attorney Wally Bugden thinks the charges are overkill and that her title of Miss Riverton is almost being held against her.

'You could say it's possible that the chemical could splash someone, but that certainly was not their intetion,' Bugden said. 'They weren't trying to harm anyone. They were playing a prank.'

Gill was crowned Miss Riverton, topping a slate of nine beauty contestants earlier this summer in the Salt Lake City suburb. She showed off years of piano training with a Scott Joplin number and took home a $2,000 scholarship.

It took a lot of hard work to win that title and scholarship, so giving it up was pretty difficult for Gill.

'I just (knew) … I would probably have to get it taken away from me, just because of the contract. So I’d rather have it be my decision now than to have someone take it from me,' she said.

Her parents also weighed in on the 
rebellious act. Her mother, Michelle Gill, said it was hard to get mad 
at her daughter knowing that her intentions were good.

One of Gill's friends claims they were throwing the bombs as a prank, however, authorities said someone could have been gravely injured by the explosives

Her father Gavin Gill said: 'I’m confident that the legal system will handle it correctly, and the people that understand the facts of what’s going on and the character of all four of the youngsters that are involved in this will see this and handle it appropriately.'

Gill remains optimistic that the situation will be positive in the end.

'I do believe this whole thing is a way to help us grow and to learn from our mistakes and to move forward and just kind of get on with our lives.'
