He's studied the behavioural patterns of animals on every corner of the planet, but Sir David Attenborough  might be perplexed by a new study on an unexpected human preference.

The survey has found that despite approaching his 90th birthday, brainy specimen Sir David has been deemed exceptionally cool by his fellow homo sapiens.

The 88-year-old broadcaster - most famous for his award-winning wildlife documentaries - has even beaten heartthrob David Beckham in a poll of the coolest men on the planet.

Johnny Depp reigns supreme - and was voted coolest man on the planet

He also trumped the likes of Jay Z, Elvis Presley and Harry Styles.

Cambridge graduate Sir David, who first started at the BBC in the early 1950s, has gone on to become a national treasure by fronting countless nature shows.

But  Hollywood A-lister Johnny Depp came first, followed by Luther star Idris Elba who was voted as runner-up in the survey of 3,000 adults by paid survey site OnePoll.com.

In third place was Will Smith, who shot to fame in the US sitcom the Fresh Prince of Bel Air.

And Prince Harry who, at 30 is the youngest living man to be named, scraped into the top ten at number nine.

John Sewell spokesman for OnePoll.com said: 'This is a really eclectic list of men. It shows that you don't necessarily have to be young and in vogue to be considered cool.

'What one person deems as cool will be very different to that of the next person, but it's great to see established professionals like David Attenborough in the mix with rappers, footballers and film legends.

'Similarly, it's pretty flattering for the likes of Harry Styles to be mentioned in the same breath as Mick Jagger, Frank Sinatra, Jay Z.'

The only royal to get a mention in the top 50 list was and recently married Sherlock actor Benedict Cumberbatch completed the top 10.

Formula One racing rivals Lewis Hamilton and Jenson Button both made the list, in 17th and 34th place respectively. And despite dying 60 years ago at the age of 24, James Dean completed the top 20 coolest celebs.

John Sewell added: 'As you would expect, many of the coolest men on the planet are Hollywood actors.

'But it's great to see so many Brits on the list - especially the likes of Sir Ian McKellen, Sir Michael Caine and Sir Mick Jagger, who have been entertaining the British public for decades.'

Elvis Presley came in eleventh, proving that e may have been dead for 37 years but he's still cool

Leonardo DiCaprio has the cool factor but at 14th on the list he's trumped by Bill Murray and Sean Connery
