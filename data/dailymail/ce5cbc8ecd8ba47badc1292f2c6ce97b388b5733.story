Opulent processions, well-coiffed royals and a few European landmarks thrown in - it is the perfect light watching to ease you into the day.

And television networks didn't miss a trick with the Queen's Jubilee, sending out their big names - topped with a variety of obnoxious hats - to cover the four-day event in London.

With the UK five hours ahead of Eastern time, the festivities fall perfectly for morning television.  And as the celebration reaches its conclusion on Tuesday,  the networks battle for the best coverage.

Together again: Matt Lauer and Meredith Vieira were reunited as co-hosts at Buckingham Palace while cover the Queen's Jubilee clebration for the Today show

Leading the pack has been the Today show, which sent Meredith Vieira to preview the long weekend's festivities on Friday from the Tower of London.

She has since been at the helm of the show's coverage, broadcasting from Buckingham Palace. On Tuesday, NBC added more big names to the mix, sending out Al Roker and Matt Lauer to join her.

Vieira had previously warned them to 'bring the long 
johns' to fight the weather, but joked that the drizzle made 'the events
 more British, not less'.

CNN flashed jubilant scenes of thousands of well wishers waving flags along The Mall. Piers Morgan and Brooke Baldwin will lead the live CNN broadcast live for two hours starting at 9 a.m. ET.

Protests by British republicans – a mere footnote in the UK -- are enjoying prime-time coverage on Iranian state-run television channels which have ignored the loyal majority’s revelry.

'Chants of Monarchy Out! Republic In echo in UK,' trumpeted a headline on the website of Iran’s English language Press TV.

Tehran’s main Persian language channel, IRTV 1, declared that the Queen should shoulder some responsible for Britain’s 'grave economic situation.'

It opined: 'The extravagant spending of the Queen, including the expensive wedding of Prince William, her annual tours and festivities and the current diamond jubilee celebrations have added to the problems.'

RTV 1featured a protestor proclaiming, 'I speak on behalf of millions of British people who are opposed to the monarchist system.'

Iran has been staunchly republican since its Islamic revolution in 1979 overthrew 2,500 years of monarchy.

Good
 Morning America is hosting 'GMA at the Jubilee' with Robin Roberts 
broadcasting live from outside Buckingham Palace, interviewing British 
celebrities while looking at processions below.

CNN led the coverage over the weekend, broadcasting the Thames Jubilee Pageant and the Diamond Jubilee Service of Thanksgiving.

But,
 while UK viewers reveled in the wonderment of the concert on Monday 
night - featuring Kylie Minogue, Will.i.am and Elton John, among others -
 U.S. audiences were comparatively hard done by.

ABC nabbed exclusive rights to the show and presented excerpts from 9 p.m. ET during 20/20: Concert for the Queen.

Coverage of the occasion has varied across the world.

Republican France celebrated the Queen's Diamond Jubilee as if its own Revolution had never happened.

The celebrations in London dominated TV screens and newspapers, with Le Monde correspondent Marc Roche saying the French 'don't know much about the Queen, but they like the pomp and circumstance, they like the grandeur of the institution.'

More than 3.5million watched a three-and-a-half hour live Jubilee special on France 2 television on Sunday afternoon.

'We got 26.3 per cent of the audience, despite the French Open tennis tournament being on at the same time on another channel,' said Yannick Letranchant, who commissioned the programme.

Last year's Royal Wedding and the success of the film 'The King's Speech' has made the British monarch extremely popular.

Princess Diana, who died in Paris in 1997, is also remembered with great fondness. 'We have no royal family, so we end up with characters like Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni living like royals,' said Parisian Genevieve Blanc.

'They are nothing like as impressive as the real thing, and in fact end up embarrassing us. This is one of the main reasons why we envy the British.'

All newspapers covered the Jubilee on their front page at some point, with Figaro giving a number of reasons why the Queen is 'cool again'.

In Italy, the were covered extensively on the TV, newspapers, radio and internet with photographs of the river pageant dominating - as well as several pictures of the Duchess of Cambridge looking regal in her bright red dress.

Every morning, the main channels had a
 live link-up via their London correspondents to describe the previous 
day's events and go through proceedings.

Even British Rome-based correspondents were asked to contribute an opinion.

Italian coverage highlighted how a 
Venetian gondola had taken part in the river pageant and all the 
coverage described how despite the dismal weather that more than a 
million people turned up to see the spectacle - underlining the strength
 of feeling for the Queen.

Repubblica described the Queen as 
'Elizabeth the Great' adding how the crowds had been 'partying wildly' 
throughout the whole weekend.

Corriere Della Sera said the pageant 
had 'told the story of the Windsors,navigating through crisis and 
splendour, through love and intrigue'.

Il Messaggero described the 
celebrations as an 'unprecedented spectacle' adding how the 
photographers had all been 'pointing their cameras towards Kate as well 
as the Queen, with her stunning red dress.'

The coverage also highlighted how the
 Duke of Edinburgh had been forced to miss the last two days of 
celebrations after 'bravely enduring the cold for four hours', but the 
Queen had continued with the festivities once informed he was doing well
 in hospital.

BBC Worldwide aired the Diamond 
Jubilee Celebrations on channels across Asia, Australia, New Zealand, 
Latin America, India, Africa, Europe and the Middle East.

A
 spokesperson said it was still too early to obtain exact viewing 
figures, but said they had already received 'amazing feedback.'

In
 Australia there was an outcry as ABC shunned the celebrations and 
showed a repeat of raunchy Warren Beatty movie Shampoo instead.

Australians for Constitutional Monarchy head, Professor David Flint, has  attacked the ABC for the snub.

'I think it is absolutely appalling and astounding,' Professor Flint said.

In
 Canada, CBC covered an extensive amount of the celebrations and 
reported that more than a million Canadians watched their coverage 
yesterday morning.

It 
seemed that on a worldwide basis, the Jubilee received much lighter 
coverage from the media than the Royal Wedding in April 2011.

'I
 assumed the ABC was going to at least broadcast the central events, as 
you would expect them to do a royal wedding or a coronation.'

On Tuesday night, ABC in the U.S. will broadcast two-hour highlights of the concert from 9 p.m. ET.

Audiences
 still have the Ceremonial day to look forward to, where the queen and 
royal family and 2,000 British worthies will attend an Anglican 
thanksgiving service at St. Paul's Cathedral.

After this, the queen and royal 
family will attend private receptions, then a lunch at Westminster Hall 
before taking a procession, lined with military bands and troops, back 
to Buckingham Palace.

Around 3:30 p.m. local time - 10.30 a.m. ET - the royal family will assemble on the balcony.

Good Morning America, World News with Diane Sawyer and Nightline will broadcast throughout the day.

In addition to the U.S. channels, BBC 
America has been offering wide coverage. On Tuesday, BBC America will 
broadcast live from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. ET.

All smiles: There will be a procession later today before the royal family assemble on the balcony

It comes after some channels also heavily previewed the weekend's events. Viera popped out to London well ahead of the festivities to preview events from the Tower of London on Friday.

And in last week's ABC special,The Jubilee Queen with Katie Couric, the beloved anchor quizzed Princes William and Harry, as well as the Duke of York and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie.

While colourful scenes were splashed across television screens, the coverage by the American newspapers was comparatively lifeless.

In the U.S. newspapers, mentions
 of the widespread parties and the Queen's processions have been sparse,
 hidden in the back pages and squashed alongside the ads.

Instead, the press, including the New York Post and the New York Times, focused on the bad news from the weekend - Prince Philip's trip to hospital.

The Queen's husband, who turns 91 this weekend, was admitted to hospital on Monday with a bladder infection and will remain there for a few days as a precaution.
