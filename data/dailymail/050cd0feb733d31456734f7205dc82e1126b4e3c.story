A newlywed has allegedly shot dead his wife who was pregnant with twin boys - killing one baby and leaving the other fighting for his life.

Michael Boyce, 33, allegedly shot Alexis Boyce, 23, who was eight-months pregnant, once in the head in the Orlando, Florida home they shared with her parents.

The parents were in their bedroom at the time and did not see the alleged killing, but heard the gunshot. Alexis' father called police around 5.20pm.

She was rushed to Orlando Regional Medical Center but was pronounced dead on arrival, along with one of her unborn sons.

The other boy was listed in critical condition on Thursday night at the neonatal intensive care unit at Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women & Babies.

Boyce initially told authorities that his wife had shot herself in the head, but when he was presented with further evidence, he switched his story.

Boyce then claimed he had accidentally shot her, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

He was arrested on first-degree murder charges and taken to the Orange County Jail.

He has so far been charged with the murder of his wife but authorities said further charges regarding the death of his unborn son could also be brought, WFTV reported.

The news station was outside the Orange County Sheriff's Office as Boyce, dressed in a white jump suit, was taken to a patrol car that took him to the Orange County Jail early on Friday morning.

He was led away in handcuffs, kept his head down and refused to answer reporters' questions.

He is expected to make his first appearance in front of a judge Friday afternoon.

The couple, who police said apparently did not have a history of domestic violence, had been married for about a year. Their Facebook pages suggest both have served in the U.S. Navy.
