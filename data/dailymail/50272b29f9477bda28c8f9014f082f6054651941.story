The teenage nephew of serial killer Ivan Milat was sentenced to at least 30 years jail today for a chilling axe murder in the same grim forest where his uncle slaughtered seven backpackers.

Matthew Milat brought down a mediaeval-style double-edged axe onto the head of his childhood friend David Auchterlonie in the Belanglo State Forest, south of Sydney, where 20 years earlier Ivan Milat had murdered two British women and five other travellers.

Matthew Milat's accomplice in the cold-blooded murder, Cohen Klein, was sentenced to at least 22 years behind bars.

The pair, who were aged 17 and 18 at the time of the axe murder in November 2010, pleaded guilty to murder last year but despite letters of remorse by Milat, Acting Justice Jane Mathews said today that he remained a 'serious potential danger' to the community.

Killer: Matthew Milat, a relative of notorious Australian serial killer Ivan Milat, was jailed for at least 30 years for axing a teenage friend to death

Referring to the teenage victim, Justice Mathews said it was impossible to describe the horror of the killing.

'It clearly falls in the worst category for the case of murder.'

Milat, she said, 'took the life of an innocent young man who was unfortunate enough to be his friend in a completely brutal manner simply for his own enjoyment.'

The NSW Supreme Court had heard that the before the killing, Milat had rubbed his hands together and said: 'We're going to Belanglo - someone's going to die.'

Then, the day after the murder, Milat gloated about the killing and said 'You know me, you know my family. You know the last name Milat. I'm doing what my family does.'

Australia's notorious serial killer Ivan Milat is led from court during his trial in Sydney July 8, 1996. He killed seven backbackers

The location of the murder, the court was told, was 'significant' as it was where Ivan Milat had 'lured a number of people and murdered them.'

Among Ivan Milat's victims in the late 1980s and early 1990s were English backpackers Caroline Clarke and Joanne Walters who were given a lift by him - and driven into the forest where Miss Clarke was repeatedly stabbed and Miss Walters shot.

A mobile phone that was running at the time of the murder of 17-year-old David Auchterlonie picked up Matthew Milat telling his intended victim: 'Tell people my f-----g business and you wind up hurt.'

The audio also recorded the sound of the axe striking David Auchterlonie in the head.

The judge said that to describe the recording as chilling was an understatement. 'It is extremely distressing material.

'You know me, you know my family. You know the last name Milat. I'm doing what my family does.'

'The sound of (David) crying out in agony is chilling in the extreme.

'(David) was being entirely submissive during the whole of the episode and desperately tried to placate Milat.'

The court heard details of a number of poems that Milat wrote during his time in custody including one that had the lines 'I am not fazed by blood or screams, nothing I do will haunt my

dreams.'

Another 'very chilling' poem appeared to recount the murder, said the judge.

'It is quite the opposite (of remorse). He appears to be revelling in the memory of this terrible event.'

She read one poem that Milat wrote more than nine months after the murder, entitled 'Your Last Day'.

The first few lines ran: 'Click-clack Hear that, Stopping in the middle of the track, Are you getting Nervous in the back, Should be C---, your getting waked.'

The poem ended with the lines: 'Hear the crunch of leaves and feet, Feel your heart skip a beat Are ya gunna get away, No hope kid, this is your day, The day that you won't be found, Six feet under Neath the ground.'

Milat was sentenced to 43 years in jail with a 30-year non-parole period, while his accomplice Klein was sentenced to 32 years imprisonment with a 22-year non-parole period.

David Auchterlonie's mother, Donna Locke, wanted Milat to be sent away for life.

'He can still come out and live some of his life, which is something David can never do,' she said outside the court.

'He shouldn't have been allowed to leave until he was cold and grey in a body bag like my son when he left the forest.' Ivan Milat is serving seven life sentences for the Belanglo murders.
