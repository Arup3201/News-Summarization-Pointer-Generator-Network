LeAnn Rimes has entered rehab for 'anxiety and stress'.

The country singer has 'voluntarily' admitted herself to the facility for 30 days... just a day after her 30th birthday.

Rimes' representative Marcel Pariseau has confirmed the news to People.com, saying in a statement: 'LeAnn has voluntarily entered a 30 day in-patient treatment facility to cope with anxiety and stress.

'While there will be speculation regarding her treatment, she is simply there to learn and develop coping mechanisms. While privacy isn't expected, it's certainly appreciated.'

And the star has spoken out herself about her decision to go into the rehabilitation centre.

She told the website: 'This is just a time for me to emotionally check out for a second and take care of myself and come back in 30 days as the best 30-year-old woman I can be.

'All the things in my life will be there when I get out, but you know what? I'm hoping they're not going to affect me as much. I'll have the tools to know how to deal with them.'

It comes just a day after she let her hair down for her 30th celebrations.

She has spent the past month indulging in an array of festivities to mark the milestone.

Recovery: She has decided to take time out at the centre for 30 days

And on Tuesday, as the big day 
finally arrived, LeAnn Rimes headed out to a Malibu restaurant with 
husband Eddie Cibrian for an intimate dinner for what surely must be her
last celebration of the milestone.

But her husband has also spoken out to show his support for her decision.

He added: 'My wife is the most remarkable and courageous woman I know.

'I am so proud of her for having the strength to finally take some time for herself. I will be with her every step of the way.'

It comes as a former Twitter follower of the star claims she called her up to swear at her after the pair had a row over LeAnn's affair on the micro-blogging site.

The woman, named Kimberly Smiley, alleged to Radar Online that LeAnn phoned her up and said: 'Hey b****, this is LeAnn, you have five minutes to say whatever you want to me.'

When she stepped out yesterday, before entering the centre, the country singer looked a little less preened than usual with scruffy
hair and a casual outfit as she and Eddie strolled through the Los 
Angeles sunshine for an intimate meal at Nobu.

Now it seems it may have been a goodbye lunch as they may have been aware she was going to stay at the centre for several weeks.

The star had teased her long wavy blonde mane into a hastily assembled half ponytail for her dinner out.

A baggy grey T-shirt, long gold cross chain and long black skirt slit to the thigh did little to hide the singer's extremely slim figure.

Grey fringed boots and a snakeskin bag completed the look, while Eddie sported a casual white shirt and jeans, and appeared to be carrying a bag which perhaps contained a present for his wife.

Judging by LeAnn's smiling appearance, she was more than happy to bid farewell to her 20s and embrace a new decade. 

'They looked really happy and were talking a lot,' an fellow restaurant goer told Us Weekly. 'He was really animated and she was beaming. They held hands across the table at some points.'

The star held a larger birthday celebration back on August 18 in a private bash attended by 
family and friends.

'I've
been ready to leave my 20s behind,' LeAnn told People at the bash. 'I had so many 
amazing things happen in my 20s, and I also had a lot of hard lessons to
learn.'

She added: 'I really have 
been truly excited about turning 30. I'm ready to be stronger than ever.
It's a new chapter.'

According to the website, LeAnn blew out candles on a cake which featured a 
mini-version of herself wearing a bikini standing on top of a coffin. 'I'm stompin' 
on my 20s, stompin' 'em out,' she explained.

'It's funny that people have this obsession with me in a bikini,' she added. 'I'm on the beach. What am I supposed to wear?

'I grew up with chronic psoriasis my 
whole life and the last six years is the first time I've actually been 
super healthy. My skin is clear, I'm taking care of myself, and since 
I'm turning 30, between psoriasis and my [bottom] sagging, I only have a
few more years to do it so I might as well wear one!'

Eddie also gave his wife a romantic early birthday gift - a rose gold and diamond Cartier 'Love' bracelet.

'I've always wanted one. I cried so hard when he gave it to me,' said LeAnn. 'He's always so thoughtful.'

LeAnn was also given another memorable present by a old schoolfriend. She said: 'A 
friend I've known since I was 15 had everyone make a little video about 
their favourite memory of me, and he put it all together. It made me cry 
for half a day. I have a beautiful life – I am
lucky.'

Along with her birthday party and yesterday's intimate dinner, the star sported a bikini for a celebratory beach party last weekend, tweeting: 'HUGE thx to @donjulio for providing
the tequila and awesome mixologist for my 30th bday!!!'
