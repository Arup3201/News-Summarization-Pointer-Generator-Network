British business today throws its weight behind an in-out referendum on Europe and warns ‘the status quo is not an option’.

A survey of nearly 4,000 company bosses in the UK shows more than three-quarters back giving the public a say on membership of the European Union.

It also reveals that British business is becoming more Eurosceptic with growing support for quitting the EU altogether or withdrawing and securing new trade agreements.

However, the majority - or 61.4 per cent of those asked in the British Chambers of Commerce poll - wants Britain to remain in the EU with powers transferred from Brussels to Westminster.

Many captains of British industry want a public vote on whethere the UK should leave Europe

‘The status quo is not an option,’ says BCC director general John Longworth in the report. ‘Ministers must pursue reform and renegotiation as a priority.

‘These results show that British businesses remain determined to see a recalibrated relationship between the UK and the rest of the European Union, with more powers exercised from Westminster rather than Brussels.’

David Cameron has promised to renegotiate the terms of Britain’s membership of the EU and hold an in-out referendum in 2017 if the Conservatives win the 2015 general election.

It would be the first vote on the UK’s relationship with Europe since 1975 but it is vehemently opposed by Labour and the Liberal Democrats.

The BCC report shows that 53.6 per cent of firms believe a full withdrawal from the EU would be bad for business.

The prospect of a referendum has also sparked outrage among Europhiles who claim that Britain would be isolated economically and politically if it left the EU.

But 800 business leaders have now signed up to Business for Britain, a campaign group in favour of renegotiating the terms of UK membership of the EU.

Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the group, said: ‘It is fantastic to see further evidence that business people in Britain want to have their say on the EU.

‘It would be wrong of anyone to characterise British business as being content with the current relationship with Brussels, which is why it is so important that the process of renegotiating a fundamental change in Britain’s membership begins today.’

The BCC report shows that 53.6 per cent of firms believe a full withdrawal from the EU would be bad for business.

But this is down from 60 per cent three months ago while the proportion who believes quitting the EU would be good for business has risen from 18 per cent to 19.5 per cent.

Over one-third of companies, or 35.6 per cent, favour withdrawal followed by new trade agreements to ensure exports are not hit.

This is up from 33 per cent three months ago while opposition to such a move has fallen from 42 per cent to 36.7 per cent.

But the majority - or more than six in 10 company bosses - want Britain to remain in the EU with powers transferred back from Brussels to Westminster.

And although 43 per cent of business back the Prime Minister’s plan to hold a referendum in 2017 after negotiations have run their course, 34 per cent want a vote far sooner.

‘Businesses reject both the Europhile dream of further integration and the Europhobe dream of a complete exit from the EU provided a satisfactory renegotiation is achieved,’ says Mr Longworth.

But he warns that the split over when the referendum should take place ‘shows that there is an impatience amongst a significant number of companies for greater clarity on the UK’s position’.
