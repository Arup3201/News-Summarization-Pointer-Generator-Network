Celtc will have to break the £2million barrier in their quest to sign Stuart Armstrong after Dundee United rejected an approach worth in the region of £1.5m.

Burnley have also seen an offer - thought to be less than the one on the table from Parkhead - snubbed by the Tannadice club.

Turf Moor manager Sean Dyche insists they are ‘highly unlikely’ to up their bid for Armstrong, but Celtic will have to come back with an improved package if they are to land one of Ronny Deila’s key targets before Monday’s transfer deadline.

Dundee United are holding out for £2.5m for Armstrong and have rejected a bid from Celtic too

United remain adamant they have no need to sell and are thought to be sticking to a £2.5m valuation for the 22-year-old midfielder, who is under contract until the summer of 2016.

‘Neither of these bids is anywhere close to our valuation,’ said a Tannadice spokesman. ‘Neither bid is nearly close enough to consider.’

United are already losing winger Gary Mackay-Steven to Parkhead on a pre-contract agreement, with the possibility Celtic could yet offer a fee for a quicker move in the current window.

Barring a dramatic development, Armstrong is set to play for Jackie McNamara’s side in Saturday’s League Cup semi-final against Aberdeen at Hampden.

Dyche claimed Burnley didn’t view the Scotland Under-21 cap as a player ready to make an immediate and regular first-team impact. They could now renew their attempts to instead land Scotland midfielder Graham Dorrans, who may be available from West Brom for around £3m.

‘Different offers have been in for players,’ said Dyche. ‘We like to do things privately, others don’t.

‘But he (Armstrong) is more of a development player. We’ve had offers in for what you’d call more recognised players but they haven’t got over the line yet.’

Asked if an improved bid for Armstrong was imminent, Dyche replied: ‘Highly unlikely. We just thought it was an offer for player who could progress with us.’ 

Manager Sean Dyche also has an interest in West Bromwich Albion’s £3m-rated midfielder Graham Dorrans and Celtic forward Anthony Stokes.

Meanwhile, Brighton & Hove Albion have signed midfielder Beram Kayal from Celtic.
