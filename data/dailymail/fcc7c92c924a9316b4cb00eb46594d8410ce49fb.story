England also continue to assess injuries to backline trio Brad Barritt, Kyle Eastmond and Owen Farrell, while Northampton centre Luther Burrell is expected to return to training on Friday after suffering concussion against Racing.

Fly-half Farrell hobbled off with a knee problem during the first half of Saracens' defeat to Clermont Auvergne on Sunday, while Eastmond injured his shoulder in Bath's 20-15 win over Glasgow on the same day.

The injuries continue to mount for England ahead of the Six Nations opener against Wales in Cardiff on February 6 and Lancaster admitted he does not yet know how long his absentees will remain sidelined. 

Christian Day had originally beeb selected for England Saxons to face Ireland on Friday

He said: 'The players will be fully assessed once they get into camp this evening and it's too early to give any definitive news on their status. 

'Tom's ankle and Owen's knee has been scanned. Owen will see a specialist this evening and we will be able to provide an update on him and the other injured players tomorrow, along with any other potential additions to the squad.'

Croft and Day have been originally called up to the England Saxons squad for Friday's game against Ireland Wolfhounds in Cork.

Their Saxons places will be filled by Wasps lock James Gaskell and Bath back-row forward Carl Fearns.

England coach, Stuart Lancaster faces an anxious wait to discover extent of the players' injuries

Croft made his England debut against France during the 2008 Six Nations campaign and has 38 caps to date.

The 29-year-old was an IRB player of the year nominee in 2009 and was part of the British and Irish Lions squad that toured Australia in 2013.

Day, 31, has represented England at Under-19 and Under-21 level and joined Northampton from Stade Francais in 2008.
