Orbiting Earth at this very moment are thousands of chunks of space junk that pose a threat to satellites and spacecraft alike.

To monitor this debris Japan is planning to launch a military space force by 2019 that will be tasked with protecting satellites.

The initial goal of this new division will be to track the various pieces of junk and prevent satellites being damaged or destroyed by collisions in future.

In five years Japan will assemble a space force to monitor junk in Earth orbit. The unit will use telescope and radar facilities in Japan's Okayama region. It will be made up of personnel from the country's Air Self-Defense Force with their F-15J Eagle aircraft picturing performing a flyover during an inspection parade in 2010

Since the first object, Sputnik 1, was launched into space 53 years ago, mankind has created a swarm of hundreds of thousands of items of debris.

The rubbish circling the planet comes from old rockets, abandoned satellites and missile shrapnel.

There are around 22,000 objects in orbit that are big enough for officials on the ground to track and countless more smaller ones that could do damage to human-carrying spaceships and valuable satellites.

One major source of debris in the past was a Chinese anti-satellite missile test in 2007 that left an estimated 150,000 pieces of junk in the atmosphere. 

Accidental events have also contributed to the problem. In 2009 for instance there was a major crash between a U.S. communications satellite and a defunct Russian military probe over Siberia.

Space junk is a growing problem for travel into the cosmos.

According to Nasa more than 500,000 pieces of debris are orbiting Earth at speeds of more than 17,500 miles (28,000 kilometres) per hour.

At this speed a piece as small as a golf ball could smash a satellite to pieces.

Some have even suggested we may be heading towards a ‘Kessler syndrome’-type event.

This was envisaged in the 2013 movie Gravity, which portrayed a satellite collision that sparked a chain reaction where debris increasingly impacted other satellites, creating more debris in the process.

This has led many companies and agencies to draw up plans to reduce the amount of space debris in Earth orbit, such as proposals to drag debris down with magnetic nets or lasers.

The Swiss-based CleanSpaceOne, meanwhile, could grab larger pieces of debris or defunct satellites with a ‘claw’ at its front before dragging it back down to burn up in the atmosphere.

Pictured is a hole caused by orbital debris that was found in Nasa's Solar Maximum Mission when it was serviced aboard Space Shuttle Challenger in 1984. The Earth-orbiting satellite launched on 14 February 1980 to observe the sun and re-entered the atmosphere in 1989

Japan’s decision to dedicate part of its national defense to cleaning up Earth orbit will therefore be a welcome development for worried engineers.

The move follows Japan’s decision in 2008 to allow military activities in space.

The space force will be part of a partnership with the US, as the two seek to cooperate in space, referred to as the ‘fourth battlefield’ by a source in the Mainichi Shimbun.

The unit will use radar and telescope facilities jointly with the science ministry and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (Jaxa) to run its observatory operations.

These will likely be the radar and telescope facilities in Okayama operated by Tokyo-based think-tank Japan Space Forum.

And the space force may be composed of personnel from the Air Self-Defence Force, the country’s air force.

If will also provide the US military with information gleaned from the operation.

What the goals of the space force will be beyond monitoring space junk, however, is not yet known.
