The U.S. State Department is attempting to fight back against terror group ISIS with a graphic video that aims to dissuade would-be jihadists from joining the terror group.

The Obama administration’s counter propaganda video starts with the phrase: Run. Do not walk to ISIS land, according to CNN. Then a body is thrown off a cliff.

In an attempt to use social media to target and prevent would-be jihadists from joining the group, the video was posted on a youtube channel and is
 entitled ‘Welcome to the 'Islamic State' land.

Video: In a web campaign called 'Think again, turn away' the video offers a glimpse into what the terror group stands for and shows gruesome images which were first put out by them

Execution: In the video, the opening images show gruesome executions, beheadings and violence

Mosques: The video also shows a mosque being blown up

In a web campaign called 'Think again, turn away' the video offers a glimpse into what the terror group really stands for and shows gruesome images which were first put out by them.

The anti-ISIS video was produced by the
 State Department's Center for Strategic Counterterrorism 
Communications, which seeks to combat ISIS extremist narrative on social
 media.

In the video, the opening images show a mosque being blown up, followed by a photo of a body with a severed head.

The video uses the group's own propaganda footage posted online.

It also lists so-called ‘useful skills’ ISIS sympathizers can learn if they join the group.

Among these are the ability to blow up mosques with Muslims inside, crucifying and executing Muslims and plundering public resources.

It ends with a sarcastic note to would-be jihadists: ‘Travel is inexpensive, because you won't need a return ticket!’

Content: The State Department has also set up a series of anti-ISIS accounts on Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr as part of a larger social media campaign against the group's extremism

Alberto Fernandez, coordinator of the State Department's Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications, which runs the program, has called it ‘participating in the marketplace of ideas.’

The State Department has also set up a series of anti-ISIS accounts on Facebook, Twitter and Tumblr as part of a larger social media campaign against the group’s extremism.

‘Our mission is to expose the facts about terrorists and their propaganda’ the State Department said on the campaign's Facebook page.

As concerns grow over the allure of ISIS to some young men, it’s hoped that the video will steer them away from travelling overseas.

At present, more than 100 U.S. citizens have travelled overseas to join the jihadist group.

Decisions: President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister David Cameron pressed fellow NATO leaders to confront the 'brutal and poisonous' Islamic State militant group that is wreaking havoc in Iraq and Syria - and urged regional partners like Jordan and Turkey to join the effort as well

Social media has played a powerful role in the recruitment of jihadists from Western countries such as England and the United States of America.

The U.S. government has also taken to social media to counter the recruitment drive by using platforms to send out anti extremist messages in Arabic, Urdu and Somali for the past three years.

However, ISIS continues to wage an online campaign in an attempt to grab the attention of viewers with grueseome beheading videos and promises of vengeance against the west.

It also regularly provides links to grainy phone-camera footage documenting such gory events as group executions. And the content is continually sent around the world on social media platforms.

As NATO leaders attempted to decide on the right course of action to defeat ISIS, the group has become a target of U.S. efforts.
