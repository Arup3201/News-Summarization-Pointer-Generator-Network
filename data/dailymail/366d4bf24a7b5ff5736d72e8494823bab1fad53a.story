A Melbourne man found dead in a Bali hotel room was a wealth and property motivational speaker who gave talks alongside celebrities including Arnold Schwarzenegger and Mike Tyson.

Warren Borsje from Brighton, in Melbourne's exclusive southeast suburbs, checked into room 570 at the Fave hotel in the tourist district in Seminyak on January 16 and was supposed to check out on Monday but never surfaced.

Hotel staff were calling the room from midday and eventually gained access with a master key later that night when they made the grisly discovery of the 41-year-old lying face first with dry blood around his mouth.

Mr Borsje was last seen by staff 48 hours earlier in an intoxicated state when he was being helped to his room by a fellow hotel guest.

Medicines and vitamins, including anti-acid and stamina enhancer supplements, as well as an empty bottle of vodka, were also found in the room leading police to believe that the 41-year-old man may have been unwell.

Mr Borsje's  phone, laptop, wallet and money were also found in the room.

Sanglah morgue's head of forensics, Dr Ida Bagus Putu Alit, said although the cause of death would not be determined until an autopsy was conducted - there were signs of suffocation due to a lack of oxygen.
