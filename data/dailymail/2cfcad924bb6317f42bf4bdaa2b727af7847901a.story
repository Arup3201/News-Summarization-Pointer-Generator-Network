Mice infestation: The terrified star took to Twitter to tell fans that she 'shrieked with fear' after spotting the rodent

Elizabeth Hurley says she 'shrieked with fear' when she encountered an infestation of mice at her plush mansion.

The terrified star took to Twitter to tell fans that she came face-to-face with a mouse in her living room in Donnington Hall, Herefordshire.

Ms Hurley, 48, was spending Easter at home with friends and family, but quickly took to the social media site to express her plans to launch 'operation vermin' after seeing the mouse.

She tweeted: My mum on her way round with her two killer cats. I'm having a stiff drink.'

She added: 'Operation vermin started early this morning. On my hands and knees looking for evidence.'

The next day she tweeted: 'Thank you for all your rodent killing advice...taking it all on board. Have declared war on them.'

The star, has two homes in the UK - a mansion in Herefordshire and a stylish flat in West London.

Her mansion was reported to have cost £6million when she bought it two years ago with ex-boyfriend Australian, Shane Warne, 44.

It's estimated that along with common house mice, there are over 10million super rats throughout Britain, in a growing problem that is cropping up in areas from London to Liverpool.

Pest control experts have warned that 
the super rats are likely to become more common in the UK as more 
households get careless about how they throw out their rubbish, and 
discard left-over fast food.

They also warn that the rodents are becoming increasingly resistant to poison.

Experts say the conventional blood-thinning poison used to kill the rats is not working as it used to.

Now
 pest controllers are calling on the government to tighten up its 
response to the monster-size vermin and asking the EU to approve 
stronger ‘third generation poison’ to kill them.

Merseyside
 pest controller Sean Whelan from Whelan Services told Mail Online: 
‘We’re seeing an upsurge in rat call-outs, it’s gone up significantly by
 about 15 per cent over the past year.

‘It’s
 been very good for us. But I’m not entirely sure what’s causing it, it 
could be the weather, it’s been very cold and it’s been very wet.

‘They’re twice as large as they once were. It’s definitely not uncommon to see rats the size of a cat.

‘The problem is that they’re feeding more than they used to. They’re feeding off leftover junk food that we throw away.

‘If
 there is vermin, 99.9 per cent of the time it’s our fault. We’re 
basically feeding them and they get used to it. So they keep coming 
around us to get more food,' he added.

A new map has revealed the hotspots where the rats are located, showing how widespread the problem is in affluent parts of the country.

Pest expert Dr Colin Prescott, from Reading University, also confirms that the rats are increasingly resistant to the poison being used on them.

He also says that the resistance was thought to be confined to rats living in Berkshire, but it is much more widespread, as rats all over the country show increasing immunity.

Today, the 'monster rats' are 
in every town throughout the country and there has been an increase in 
sightings in Liverpool, Birmingham and London.

During the 1960s onwards, rat poison 
was based on the blood-thinning agent warfarin. It worked by draining 
the blood from the rat and killing it.

At present, pest controllers use bromadiolone, but both are proving to be ineffective on some monster vermin.

‘We
 find that the rats are becoming resistant to poison,' Mr whelan said. 
'We used to use Warafin when I first started out 23 years ago. It was 
the first generation of rat poisoning and used to work but doesn't do 
much now.

'We need new, stronger poisons as they've grown used to what we use.'

However, rat poisons are controversial, due to secondary poisoning and risks to children, pets and wildlife.

Rodents
 are difficult to kill with poisons because their feeding habits reflect
 their place as scavengers. Rats will eat a small bit of something and 
wait, and if they don't get sick, they continue.

An effective rodenticide must be tasteless and odorless in lethal concentrations, and have a delayed effect.

There have been two generations of poisons given to rats. The first generation include: warfarin and coumatetralyl.

The second generation are: difenacoum, brodifacoum, flocoumafen and bromadiolone. But rats are growing increasingly resistant to both.

Both Mr Whelan and Dr Prescott are calling on the EU to approve stronger rat poison.

But wildlife campaigners have also raised concerns that it could wreak havoc on animal and birds.

However, rat sightings are growing, and one image taken last week in
 Cornwall, shows a giant rat being held up by its tail -  and the man 
holding it is 6ft 1in, giving a sense of its horrifying scale.

Pest control experts warn that there will be even more monster rats 
found if they are allowed to feast on food near junk food shops, 
restaurants and household bin areas outside blocks of flats.
