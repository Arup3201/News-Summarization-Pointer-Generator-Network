A model’s career was almost destroyed after she discovered she’d been given toxic breast implants.

Elizabeth Cathey, 26, was devastated to find that the implants would be removed, but could not be replaced - and feared her modelling days were over.

She was of of thousands of women caught up in the PIP scandal involving defective breast implants.

But seeing her distress, friends and family rallied round to raise funds for the replacement surgery and she is now working again.

Miss Cathey, from Worcester, said: 'When I realised that I could end up being totally flat chested again, I was distraught.

'I’d been desperate for a boob job for over a decade and they meant everything to me - without them I was totally insecure and self conscious.

'Before my boob job I’d been bullied for the way I looked, and the thought of going back to that was horrendous.

'My boobs weren’t just about looking good, they were about confidence, and feeling happy in my own skin.

'There’s no way I could have carried on with my career - and no one has ever seen a flat chested fetish model.'

Miss Cathey, who has modelled for magazines such as Nuts and Bizzare, was extremely insecure about her body shape as a teenager and had been desperate to have breast implants

Miss Cathey, who has modelled for magazines such as Nuts and Bizzare, was extremely insecure about her body shape as a teenager.

She said: 'For as long as I can remember, I’ve always wanted my boobs done. While other girls at school began to develop, I just didn’t change shape.

'My mum would tell me to be patient, and that my time would come, but it just never did.

'I’d get comments in the changing rooms about how flat chested I was - it was just awful.

'It got to the point where I had to wear a padded bra and two sets of chicken fillets just to feel like a

woman.

'I was just always so miserable - I wasn’t the person I wanted to be. I just wanted to be feminine and a girly girl, but I was just so insecure.

'As soon as I was old enough I went for a consultation, and took out a loan to pay for the surgery.

'It was a huge decision to go ahead with it, but I know that it was absolutely the right one.'

Miss Cathey woke from her surgery in January 2006, two cup sizes bigger. She said: 'I remember looking down and a wave of relief just washed over me. I can’t really put it into words, it was just the best moment ever.'

She embraced her figure and over the next six years became a confident and successful model.

'It was a very gradual process, but I eventually became really comfortable in my own skin. I’d dabbled in a bit of modelling before, but never really felt comfortable, but after my job I was so much happier with my body.

'I started my own modelling business and it was my idea to try glamour and fetish modelling - it was a chance to show my chest off after the years of misery, and a way to stick it to my bullies. I felt great.'

But things all changed in 2011 when she watched a TV news report about the PIP implant scandal.

She said: 'I remember watching it and at first it didn’t really click that it would affect me.

'But the more I read about it, the more something niggled in the back of my mind. I was almost certain that I had the PIP implants too.'

To her horror, Miss Cathey's plastic surgeon later confirmed that she did indeed have PIP implants.

He then explained that while they could be removed, they could not be replaced.

She said: 'That was just the worse thing ever. The idea that I could have toxic implants in my body was awful.

'But to think that I could end up going back to the insecure, self conscious person I’d been without my implants was just horrendous.

'It felt like I was going to go back and relive those awful teenage years, I was just devastated. And there’s no way I could have carried on as a fetish model with a size A cup.'

Luckily, friends and family generously pulled together to pay to have her implants replaced.

She finally had the replacement surgery in February 2012 - the same day that her surgeon confirmed she did indeed have the faulty implants.

She said: 'I can never thank my friends and family enough for helping me out with my operation.

'To have the implants removed was such a huge relief - after the surgery I was told that the implants had burst as I suspected, and that toxic, non-medical grade silicone had been leaking into my body.

'When I woke up after the surgery it was like my nightmare was finally over.'

While the surgery was a success, Miss Cathey is still on a mission to get justice for herself and others that were affected by the PIP implants.

Last month, she was delighted when a ruling in a commercial court in Toulon, France, opened the way to interim compensation of 3,000 Euros, with the possibility of it being increased to 16,000 Euros if an appeal fails.

The court ruled that a German safety company, TUV Rheinland, which certified the implants, shared responsibility with the now bankrupt French supplier Poly Implant Prothhse, meaning more than 1,600 women, including about 100 in Britain, will receive the initial settlement.

Miss Cathey said: 'This ruling is a huge step in the right direction for myself and other women. We feel like we’ve been ignored up until now but this is a huge victory.'
