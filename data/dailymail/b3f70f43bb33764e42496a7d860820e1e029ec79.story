British football fans tuning in to see Luis Suarez’s highly-anticipated Barcelona debut at Real Madrid will miss the first 15 minutes of El Clasico.

The game – on Saturday, October 25 - kicks off at 5pm (BST) but broadcasting rules in the UK mean Sky Sports cannot show any action until 5.15pm.

This is because coverage of live football is not allowed between 2.45pm and 5.15pm on Saturdays during the season in a bid to protect attendances at 3pm matches.

Gareth Bale’s first El Clasico appearance was also affected by the ruling, which dates back to the 1960s.

Viewers joined last season’s game at the Nou Camp just in time to see Barcelona’s Neymar open the scoring, with the hosts eventually winning 2-1.

Suarez – banned for four months following his bite on Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup – is eligible to feature for the first time following his £75million move from Liverpool, but should he start then Sky Sports will have to rely on replays to see any early impact he makes.

Viewers, however, will be able to watch build-up to Swansea versus Leicester, which is that evening’s tea-time match.
