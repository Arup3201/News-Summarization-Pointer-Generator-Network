Tim Sherwood insists senior figures at Tottenham wanted to ‘sacrifice’ England newboy Harry Kane to bring in a foreign striker as recently as January 2014.

The Aston Villa manager said he refused to sanction any such move as head coach and instead picked the then unproven centre-forward regularly during the run-in.

Sherwood said: ‘There were people at club who wanted to bring in another striker and sacrifice Harry Kane. I wouldn’t allow that to happen. They know who they are.

Harry Kane has come on significantly as a player since Tim Sherwood handed him his Spurs debut

‘That’s why they should trust the people who know football within the club and not listen to outside influences who are trying to flog them a player.

‘If they would have brought in somebody last January and his name ended in an ‘I’ or an ‘O’, the fans would have been very excited, but I’m not sure he would have given them the same output as Harry Kane has given.’

Since 2011 Kane has experienced loan spells to varying degrees of success at Leyton Orient, Millwall, Norwich and Leicester before sparking to life with 26 goals this season. Sherwood insists only Championship clubs would have been interested 14 months ago.

‘A lot of people would have taken him but no one would have put their hand up in the Premier League,’ said Sherwood. ‘That just shows you how far he has come. Everyone will tell you now they always believed he would be a top player. But he had a few loans and a few managers never played him. They’d like him now, wouldn’t they.’

Sherwood blasted Spurs for selling academy graduates Jake Livermore and Steven Caulker and said it took fans time to warm to Kane. ‘“He’s one of our own”, they never sang that, they’ve only just started and he’s had to perform like Alan Shearer. I chuckle when I hear it,’ said Sherwood.

‘I think it’s ridiculous that you let your homegrown players go,’ he added. ‘I thought it was poor that Livermore should leave, I thought it was poor that Caulker should leave, I’m talking about players who are playing in the Premier League week in and week out.

‘I think it’s wrong for clubs to continually waste money on investing for new players who you don’t know are going to settle. It’s not always about spending money. It’s also about improving the players you have within the squad.’

The current Aston Villa boss persisted with Kane and said selling him was never an option
