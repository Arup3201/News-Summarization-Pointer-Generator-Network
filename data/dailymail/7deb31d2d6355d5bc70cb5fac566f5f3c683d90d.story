Thomas Vermaelen has taken part in a full training session with Barcelona for the first time since his summer move from Arsenal.

The ex-Gunner fell out of favour at the Emirates last season and linked up with his new team-mates as he stepped up his fitness bid. 

Belgian Vermaelen had been out with a hamstring injury picked up in his country's World Cup win over Russia on June 22 and hasn't been able to join in fully since his £15m move last month. 

Raring to go: Thomas Vermaelen trained with Barcelona for the first time since his summer move 

Whale of a time: New team-mates Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi muck about at Barca training 

Stretching: Veteran Xavi tests his 34-year-old legs ahead of Saturday's clash with Athletic Bilbao 

Suspended striker Luis Suarez was also present at La Masia, although it is still over six weeks until he can play a competitive match 

The ex-Liverpool sharpshooter is more than halfway through a four-month football ban for biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini playing for Uruguay in Brazil this summer. 

In the thick of the action: Suarez at Barcelona training 

Stuck in: Messi watches Martin Montoya on the ball 

He will look to form a devastating partnership with Lionel Messi, and the two were seen larking about 

Messi is looking to score his 400th career goal for club and country when Barcelona play Athletic Bilbao at the Nou Camp on Saturday. 

Suarez is set to make his debut in the mouthwatering clash with Real Madrid on October 26.
