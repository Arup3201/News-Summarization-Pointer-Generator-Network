Alexander Gustafsson was devastated to miss out on a rematch with Jon Jones – but believes a homecoming in front of 30,000 fans comes a close second.

The Swede takes on Anthony Johnson in Stockholm on January 24 after injury scuppered his chances a second shot at the light-heavyweight title.

And he knows he can't underestimate a rejuvenated Johnson who has seized his second chance in the UFC with both hands.

'It's been tough,' he admitted to Sportsmail. 'It sucked but that's in the past now. It felt bad for a short moment but I knew that I had to let that go and start again and get ready for new opportunities.

'I've only fought once this year and with the injury but now I'm back and feeling great.

'A lot of good things have happened too; I'm fighting in my hometown and it's going to be packed and a great night.

'But from not fighting Jon Jones to fighting Anthony Johnson in this venue that is huge, 30,000 seats is not bad and I can't complain.'

Johnson has impressed since his return to the organisation with victories over Phil Davis and Antonio Rogerio Nogueira.

And Gustafsson knows he will have to be at his best to keep his title hopes alive.

'He's a great guy and he'll be a tough opponent,' he added. 'He's a hard hitter and very explosive so I have to be ready.

'I'll train for him and his skills to be ready for what he throws and by the time of the fight, I'll know him from every situation.

'He's been in and out and cutting weight so I didn't actually think I'd see him in my division but now he is and he's been destroying guys so he's a force I cant underestimate.

'It's going to be a great fight,we're both great strikers and its a great opportunity for me to show the world I have what it takes and to show my skills.
