Indonesia's vice president says they will reimburse Australia's $1 billion  in tsunami relief aid if it's 'deemed not humanitarian' after Tony Abbott's tough talk on clemency for the Bali Nine was taken as a threat.

Vice President Jusuf Kalla said Australia was one of 56 countries to send aid to Indonesia when the Boxing Day tsunami hit in 2004, but the government was ready to pay back the money if that's what the country wanted, the Jakarta Post reports. 

'If the aid is deemed not humanitarian in nature, we will pay it back,' he said.

Mr Abbott has been widely criticised for reminding Indonesia about the $1 billion that Australia provided  as he urged mercy for death row drug smugglers Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran.

The comments sparked a sharp rebuke from the Indonesian government, with the country's foreign affairs ministry spokesman, Arrmanatha Nasir, hitting back by saying 'no one responds well to threats'.

Indonesians also started a Twitter campaign with the hashtag #CoinForAustralia to gather coins to return to Mr Abbott after he suggested the country should  'reciprocate in this way at this time'.

Mr Kalla said the coin collection campaign was an expression of people's emotional response to Mr Abbott's statements. 

The Prime Minister later clarified his remarks saying he was simply reminding Indonesia about the 'strength and depth' of the friendship between both countries.

Furious Twitter users took to the social media site to display their donation to the refund campaign for Mr Abbott, claiming Indonesia does not need Australia's help and should not be indebted to the country

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, who has been leading a carefully crafted campaign to spare the Bali Nine ringleader's lives, admitted on Tuesday Mr Abbott's comments were seen as unhelpful in Indonesia.  

'I spoke to the vice president to make it quite clear that the PM did not intend to link it in an unhelpful way,' she told the ABC on Tuesday.

'We are there when Indonesia needed us. Vice President Kalla accepted that that's the way the words should be taken.'

In the latest development, lawyers for the two men are launching a last ditch review of the presidential rejection of their clemency pleas.

Ms Bishop said she didn't want to say anything publicly which could affect the outcome of that appeal.

In the meantime the government continues to make appeals at every level of Indonesia's government, she said.

Sukumaran and Chan were due to be transferred this week from Bali to a high-security prison on Kambangan island ahead of execution.
