A Post Office worker who stole £6,000
of takings claimed the money went missing because she had accidentally 
thrown it in the bin.

Elaine Murray, 44, texted her boss to
say she had unknowingly scooped up the takings along with hundreds of 
discarded leaflets before throwing the cash away.

Murray, from Inverness, was 
originally charged with embezzling £21,000 from the Post Office but 
yesterday pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of stealing £6,000 at 
Inverness Sheriff Court.

However, her plea has angered Innes 
MacDonald, sub postmaster at Kinmylies Post Office, Inverness, who said 
he was left with a shortfall of almost £22,000 from the time that Murray
worked there.

Shocked: Innes MacDonald, pictured with Murray's original text, said when he saw the message 'the bottom of my stomach fell out'.

He is still attempting to repay the debt at a rate of £350 a month.

Mr MacDonald said he does not know what happened to the missing money.

He said his 'stomach just fell out' when he read the text from Murray in September, 2009.

It read: 'Innes I have been meaning 
to tell u this, but didn’t know how to, the reason i am short in the 
post office is because while cleaning out 1 day, i had the big bin in 
from through the back and everything was all over the floor and it went 
in the bin with hundreds of leaflets i had on the floor, i didn’t know 
how to tell u, i should have told u when i realised.'

He said yesterday: 'I asked her what she meant and how much money it was that she had put in the bin.

'At that point I could have cried. She said it was about 12 weeks or so before that she had done it.

Thief: Elaine Murray will be sentenced next month after admitting stealing £6,000 that she had claimed she accidentally threw in the bin.

'Confession': Mr MacDonald said he 'could have cried' when Murray falsely claimed over text message that she had thrown thousands of pounds in the bin.

Furious: Mr MacDonald said he is 'absolutely raging' that Murray, who was originally charged with embezzling £21,000, pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of stealing £6,000.

'We phoned round the bin companies and so on, but there was no trace of it.'

Murray was employed as manager at the post office at the time of the theft between January and September, 2009.

She is due to be sentenced next month.

But Mr MacDonald said he will demand an explanation from the procurator fiscal about why the lesser charge was brought.

He said he has repaid more than £16,000 since the missing money was noticed more than three years ago.

Mr MacDonald said: 'I am having to pay the Post Office back nearly £22,000 and I am still paying it back at £350 a month. I am absolutely raging.

'Because of this my three young kids have been deprived of a decent holiday for the last three years.

'I’m still shelling out for this. I’ve already paid back £16,000 and will have to continue paying for more than a year.

'Basically all the money I have paid back I will have to kiss goodbye to.'

Mr MacDonald said as sub-postmaster he was liable for the money. He repaid an initial £5,000 when the money was first found to be missing and is still paying off the rest.

He added: 'I was never told about the plea and that the figure would be reduced from nearly £22,000 to £6,000. I have been let down big time by the Crown Office.

'The question is what happened to the money?'

At yesterday’s hearing Sheriff William Taylor said he did not want to hear the details at this stage and will await reports.

No-one in the procurator fiscal’s office was available to discuss the case last night.
