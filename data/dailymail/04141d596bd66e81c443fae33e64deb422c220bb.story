The alleged attackers handed themselves into police on Monday morning. They are accused of breaking down a locked bedroom door to carry out the attack.

The attack ended when the 20-year-old woman's roommate came into the room and intervened.

Lee had once been in a 'casual relationship' with the woman the victim had been in bed with, police told Philly.com.

He and his co-suspects have been barred from having contact with their alleged victim and the woman he was with.

Lee, Zimmell, and Doerr face charges of home invasion, possession of a deadly weapon, assault, conspiracy and criminal mischief.

They have each been released on $46,500 secure bail.
