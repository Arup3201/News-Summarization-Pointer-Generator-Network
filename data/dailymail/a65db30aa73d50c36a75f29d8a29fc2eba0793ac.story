Sam Allardyce has been through an incredible 18 strikers during his time at West Ham, that equates to one every 9.3 weeks.

The remarkable statistic, discovered by Iron Views, comes in stark contrast to Sam Allardyce's consistent claims that the club are short on strikers.

Despite the fact that the Hammers spent £12million on Enner Valencia, it was Carlton Cole who started against Spurs in their opening Premier League game.

Signing: Enner Valencia joined West Ham for £12m after impressing for Ecuador at the World Cup

Allardyce's side averaged  just 1.05 goals per game in the Premier League last season - worse than a number of sides that finished below them.

West Ham signed Andy Carroll for £15m last summer but the former Liverpool man missed 27 league games through injury.

Hammers co-owner David Sullivan even admitted he had regretted buying him, saying: 'Had we known he would be out for this long, we would not have signed him.'
