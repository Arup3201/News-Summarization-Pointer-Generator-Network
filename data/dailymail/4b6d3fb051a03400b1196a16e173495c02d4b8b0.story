It is the moving picture that taps into America's nostalgia for the iconic Space Shuttle program.

In a fitting testament to three decades of scientific ingenuity, father and son Chris and Kenneth Bray have recreated a picture taken 30-years-ago at the launch of the first shuttle with the vehicle's final flight into the heavens last week.

The astronomy buffs - who witnessed the inaugural 1981 Columbia launch and Atlantis' swansong - created the image as a tribute to NASA's mighty flying machine.

Testament to a shared passion: Father and son Chris and Kenneth Bray watch the first and final shuttle launches 30 years apart

Standing on a causeway at Kennedy space centre in 1981, father and son are seen with binoculars in hand and camera at the ready.

And 30 years later the pair are snapped in exactly the same pose, wearing near identical clothing as they prepare to witness history for a second time.

Speaking to Universe Today Chris said that this was the picture 'we waited 30 years to complete.'

'In addition to being astronomy buffs for as long as I can remember, Dad and I have been big fans and followers of the space program - including all the private endeavours.

'We’ve only been to the two Shuttle launches. I live in NYC and he lives in NJ, so it’s not always the easiest and most convenient trip to make.'

The pair had an unlikely connection with the program.

Kenneth Bray is a jewellery designer, and in the early shuttle days designed the pin badges for each mission.

Chris added: 'Dad was a jewellery designer and made some of the official shuttle pins for the early STS missions.'

'So that’s why we were down there for the first launch.'

First: The inaugural shuttle launch of Columbia in 1981 was a milestone for space exploration

After father and son heard NASA would scrap the program, they both decided they had to come and witness the last launch for themselves.

'We were lucky enough to get in the lottery for STS-135 and scored some tickets to the Astronaut Hall of Fame viewing site.

'But
 we almost didn’t make it! Our flight out of Newark on Thursday the 7th 
was delayed five or so hours and we didn’t get to Orlando until about 2:30 
am.

'On top of that, all the rental cars were gone and despite having a reservation for a car we had no transportation.

'We
 eventually were able to rent a 15 seat passenger van (the last 
available car) from a small rental company and drove straight to the 
site, bailing on our hotel.'

The picture, which was posted on Flickr, has been viewed by more than 550,000 people so far.

David Waters, a former space shuttle contractor and media relations officer, wrote on the site: 'Everyone I used to work alongside in the shuttle program that I've forwarded this shot think its so cool, and get [sic] chills. '
