It was one of the most star-studded weddings of the year  and since tying the knot to George Clooney in a three-day wedding, Amal Alamuddin has secured her status as one of the world's favourite style icons.

The Lebanese-born lawyer, who has shot from relative obscurity to most envied woman in the world overnight, wowed with a wedding wardrobe packed with the likes of Oscar de la Renta, Dolce and Gabbana and Prada.

Today, pictures of the 36-year-old's wedding dress were finally revealed in all their glory after teasing us all weekend with her stunning selection of designer looks from Alexander McQueen,  Giambattista Valli and Stella McCartney.

Impeccable wardrobe: Amal Alamuddin tied the knot with Hollywood heartthrob George Clooney this weekend wearing a bespoke Oscar de la Renta gown embellished with diamente and pearls; it rounded off a weekend of showstopping designer outfits 

Amal wore bespoke Oscar de la Renta for her marriage to Mr Clooney and looked picture-perfect in the gown.

The French lace gown was embroidered with diamante and pearls and featured a circular train, while the wide neckline scooped just off her shoulders. The timeless and elegant dress  will no doubt inspire a thousand copy cat looks.

'He's such an elegant designer and such an elegant man,' she told People.

While the exact price of the dress was kept under wraps, a ready-to-wear creation by the coveted designer, who also designed Kate Bosworth's wedding gown, starts from £6,000 and it's thought that this bespoke design could have cost in excess of £10,000. 

Her wedding jewellery was more simple and consisted of natural pearl earrings with square-cut diamond accents. These were a gift from her parents, Baria and Ramzi Alamuddin. 

Made to measure: Renowned designer Oscar de la Renta custom-made Amal's stunning French lace gown. While the exact price of the dress is unknown, a ready-to-wear creation by the coveted designer starts from £6,000

All white! Amal looked chic in Stella McCartney  tailored, wide-leg trousers and a navy and cream top as she made her union to Mr Clooney official on Monday

Stellar in Stella: Amal looked chic in head-to-toe Stella McCartney as she arrived at Venice City Hall holding hands with George 

The day after her wedding, on Monday, the couple made their union official in a 10-minute civil ceremony at Venice City Hall. 

Amal looked chic in £450 Stella McCartney tailored, wide-leg trousers and a navy and cream top, both of which were bespoke, of course.

Completing the outfit, Amal wore McCartney's 'Beckett' clutch bag and a wide-brim hat.

The day before she wore the weekend's most colourful creation - a Giambattista Valli Haute Couture minidress, which she wore for her first appearance as Mrs Clooney on Sunday. A gown by the designer costs around £3,000.

Intricate details: The made-to-measure design  was beautifully embellished with beaded blossom set against white macrame

Flattering: The mini dress featured a structured skirt with subtle high-low hemline, which showcased her toned and tanned legs

The made-to-measure design from the Italian designer's AW14 Haute Couture collection was beautifully embellished with beaded blossom set against white macrame. 

She completed the look with a pair of the Rome-born designer's 'Specchio' pointed-toe slingbacks.

At the glamorous pre-wedding dinner, she took a tip from British royalty and wore a custom-made dress by Alexander McQueen, the same designer that the Duchess of Cambridge wore for her actual wedding.

The eye-catching scarlet gown, which perfectly complemented Amal's dark hair and eyes, was adapted from a Resort 2011 collection design, which Michelle Obama wore to a state dinner in 2011.

Amal hinted at her stylish weekend wardrobe when she landed in Venice on Friday wearing a monochrome striped dress by Italian design duo, Dolce & Gabbana, which she teamed with cut-out slingbacks and Prada shades. Dresses by D&G can range in price from £1,500-£4,750.

And with Hollywood's finest (as well as Vogue editor Anna Wintour) watching from the wings, is it any surprise that Amal pulled out all the style stops? 

Fashion writer Simon Glazin said: 'Amal is surely now the First Lady of Hollywood? She has got the high-profile hubby, has her own amazing career, will now of course be enlisted to help with charities and has the most incredible designer wardrobe.

'She has given us a glimpse of what to expect from her when dressing for occasions in the space of a few days: her monochrome Dolce & Gabbana arrival outfit demonstrates her ultra chic travelling wardrobe, the stand-out red McQueen dress was sexy eveningwear done to perfection, the post-wedding Giambattista Valli couture mini-dress shows how she does short and sassy, and the trouser-and-top combo for their civil ceremony was her answer to chic, well-tailored classic dressing.

'Not to mention the most exquisite bespoke Oscar de la Renta wedding gown, equipped with diamantes and pearls. This is the kind of dress women dream about. It was truly a masterpiece.

'Women will want her wardrobe, and they will try and emulate her looks. She's aspirational and has proven to be a style icon in the making, always wearing the clothes rather than them wearing her. She wears couture exactly as it's meant to be worn - fitted down to the last millimetre and with confidence.

'What a women! What a clever woman!'

The Duchess of Cambridge may have a contender.
