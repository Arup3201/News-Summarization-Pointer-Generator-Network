Parents of a three-week-old baby are facing an agonising wait to see if he has HIV after being given breast milk from the wrong mother by a Queensland hospital.

The incident happened at Caboolture Hospital, in Queensland's south-east, on Thursday.

An investigation has been launched into the issue by the health service that runs the hospital as the child's parents face a week-long wait for test results.

A three-week-old baby is being tested for HIV after hospital staff gave him breast milk from the wrong mother

The baby's grandmother, who said her name was Peggy, told listeners of 4BC radio station in Brisbane of the family's distress, AAP reported.

She said the boy was being tested not just for HIV, but Hepatitis A, B and C as well.

'My son and daughter-in-law are beside themselves,' Peggy told 4BC.

'We're on tenterhooks and to have something like that happen at a hospital, who's not doing their job?'

The grandmother said a nurse gave a bottle to her daughter-in-law only to return five minutes later and say it was the wrong one.

A Metro North Hospital and Health Service spokesman said they had apologised 'unreservedly' to the parents and the donor mother.

'Medical advice, provided to the families, is because of the good health of those involved there is negligible risk of health impacts to the baby as a result of this incident,' the spokesman told AAP.

'However as a precaution, to give peace of mind and certainty to the families involved, blood and milk samples have been taken for comprehensive testing.'

The boy's grandmother called a Brisbane talkback radio station on Friday telling listeners of the family's distress

Results are expected to be available within a week, with a routine confirmation test to occur again in 12 weeks.

The spokesman said any issues identified by a formal investigation would be addressed to prevent a recurrence.

Staff involved in the incident had been counselled about the importance of following all protocols in relation to expressed breast milk, he said.
