A cruel man imprisoned 23 wild garden birds and kept them locked up in his own avian Alcatraz after snaring them with homemade traps.

Twitcher Robert Grivelle, 61, caught eight greenfinches, nine sparrows, five goldfinches and one blackcap using a bird table and a piece of string leading to his home, Bristol Magistrates Court heard.

Grivelle would watch in his conservatory until an unsuspecting bird landed, then he pulled on the string - trapping the feathered creatures in wire cages - and then kept them at his home.

Crime: Robert Grivelle, pictured at his home in Bristol , imprisoned 23 wild garden birds and kept them locked up in the house and garden

He has admitted causing unnecessary suffering to the wild birds and a canary, keeping them contrary to the Wildlife and Countryside Act.

He was ordered to pay almost £1,000 after being prosecuted by the RSPCA.

Grivelle, from the Lockleaze area of Bristol, said he caged the birds because he did not want to pay £16 each for them at a pet shop.

RSPCA inspectors were alerted to Grivelle's house because of two birds in a cage in his front garden.

Elaine Laken, prosecuting, said: 'These two birds turned out to be quails, which are allowed to be kept.

'However, inspectors gained entry to the house and found many wild birds being kept in homemade cages in the defendant's three bedrooms and in the back garden.

'Grivelle admitted trapping all 23 birds over the last two years.'

The birds have since been released back into the wild, the court heard.

Ms Laken explained that Grivelle also kept a canary which was found by inspectors with a broken leg.

She said: 'The leg was hanging off by a thread. The bone was protruding and a vet said the canary would have been suffering.

'It has subsequently been euthanised.

'Grivelle's explanation was that the bird became injured only the night before when he was trying to catch it to put it back in its cage.'

Cruel: His back garden, with the bird table contraption he used to catch them, as well as cages where he kept them

She told the court that a veterinary specialist said he was in no doubt that being captured by means of a trap caused the wild birds 'chronic stress'.

He also said that being kept in a cage could cause the birds weight loss, anaemia and feather damage.

The court heard Grivelle also kept 11 other birds, which had been bought legally from a pet shop.

Grivelle, who represented himself, said: 'I would really like to keep the birds.

'I made a mistake taking them from the wild which I shouldn't have done.

'The one thing I did was take the birds in from the wild and break the law - if I don't do that again I should be alright keeping my other birds, shouldn't I?'

Bird man: Mr Grivelle was ordered to pay almost £1,000 after being prosecuted by the RSPCA, and stole the birds because he refused to go to a pet shop

He claimed he had heard that 80 per cent of wild birds died during the winter and wanted to 'save them'.

The defendant admitted making the traps and said he realised the birds were 'stressed' after being caught.

Terence Pavey, chairman of the bench, fined £400, ordered to pay £500 costs plus a £15 victim surcharge.

He said: 'One thing we would say is we do not think you did this particularly deliberately but you did it with some thought.'

He was also banned from keeping birds for five years.

RSPCA inspector Miranda Albinson said: 'This is quite an unusual case.

'Usually people catch wild birds to sell on or to collect their eggs but it seems Grivelle was genuinely keeping them as pets.

'The birds we found in cages in his bedrooms and back garden were massively stressed out.

'Some were flying back and forth in the cages hitting their heads and damaging their beaks. They were constantly trying to escape.

'We can only hope that they will survive now they are back in the wild.'
