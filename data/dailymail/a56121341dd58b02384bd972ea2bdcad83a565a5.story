Sky gazers were left stunned over the bank holiday after a rare moment of good weather was topped by a giant cloud-shaped arrow floating across a dusky sky.

Like a giant sign pointing south, the rare puff of white stood out above houses in Darlington, County Durham.

Photographer Paul Kingston spotted the cloud above the North Lodge Park area of the town and ran for his camera as it moved across the sky maintaining a perfect arrow shape.

He watched it cross as it headed for neighbouring North Yorkshire.

'I couldnâ€™t believe my eyes when I saw the bizarre cloud formation,' Mr Kingston said.

'It seemed to be urging me to head south.

'It floated around for several minutes before it was gently broken up by the breeze.'
