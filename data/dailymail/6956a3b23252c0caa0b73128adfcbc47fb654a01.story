Supermarket chain Aldi is in a battle with environmental campaigners after trying to tear down a 200-year-old tree.

Workers at the Ecology Building Society (EBS) have been fighting to save the 98 ft high tree, which is due to be felled by the low cost food chain as they try and build a new store in Silsden, West Yorkshire.

Contractors have already started to cut branches from the tree using chainsaws, as EBS staff stood under the tree in protest.

The society has half of the lime tree’s branches on their grounds.

'We are just being bullied by them,' said George Haslem, EBS chief operating officer.

'I have asked them to stop for discussions and have been ignored. I said would our staff standing under the tree stop them working and was told that the boys are on-site and they would continue their work.'

Work on the tree is currently at a standstill.

Mr Haslem said staff had placed notices around the tree on Monday asking contractors to hold off until discussions with Aldi had taken place.

On Monday EBS said it was approached by contractors from the Aldi site who wanted to get onto their premises in order to chop down the tree.

Staff at the EBS said they had been assured that no further action would take place until discussions had been resolved.

However, they said contractors returned this at around 8am this morning and began 'hacking' away at the branches of the tree.

Mr Haslem added: 'Despite half of the tree residing on half of our grounds, we have not been kept informed of discussions. I came in this morning to see contractors with chainsaws chopping of its branches with no prior warning.'

The lime tree stands on the perimeter of the newly-approved site off Keighley Road, with half of its branches reaching over a stone wall into the adjoining grounds of the EBS on Belton Road.

The new Aldi site has been designed to be built up to the adjoining wall but EBS believe there could have been an alternative option had plans been discussed.

Councillor Val Slater, Bradford Council’s Executive Member for Housing, Planning and Transport, said: 'The removal of the tree was allowed following the grant of planning permission by Committee. 

'The Tree Preservation Order still stands on a number of other trees on the site. One of the conditions of planning application being granted was that the new landscaping of the site would include the planting of a semi-mature lime tree close to the position of this tree.'

EBS has been in Silsden since 2003, where it employs around 23 people dealing with loans exclusively for eco-friendly projects.
