James Sherwood, 27, has spent the best part of the last year and a half recovering from an accident that left him in an induced coma with severe brain injury.

'It was so bad the doctors said they were surprised I could use my eyebrows again, let alone talk and walk out of there,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

At about 2 am on March 9, 2013, Sherwood was hit by a taxi while crossing the road to the Marrickville train station in Sydney's Inner West. He doesn't remember anything from that point on but knows from hospital staff that a stranger came to his aid.

Now, he is looking for that 'guardian angel' - but all he knows is that her name starts with 'M'. 

'It could be Melissa or Melanie maybe,' says Sherwood. 'I really just want to let her know that the person she helped that night is alive. I hope to meet her one day just to say thank you.'

'When I came into Emergency, the ambulance guys told my mum there was a woman who gave me first aid - they mentioned CPR - then the last thing she said  was that she was going to go and clean herself up because she had my blood all over her.'

'We know that she made calls to the hospital in the days following but her details were lost in the stress and the paperwork.'

The accident that night crushed Sherwood's upper boy, left him with a collapsed lung, a fractured skull and traumatic brain injury. Sherwood says he had been working late on a short film and was on his way home after dinner with friends. He was looking down at his mobile phone when he walked out onto the pedestrian crossing and was hit by the taxi.

The road to recovery, he says, has been a long and strange one. He came out of the coma with a 'very weird' accent and it was a few months before he had a 'functioning memory' again. He still has problems with short term memory like recalling people's names.

'I'm covered in post it notes a lot at the moment,' says Sherwood. 

'A  brain injury - it's like tampering with your soul, it's who you are and it has changed me,' he says. 'It has probably made me a lot more positive a person. The smaller things that come up in life, I wouldn't have been so forgiving about them before or seen  the good in hard situations.'

The taxi driver was never charged.

Sherwood was hit by a taxi when he stepped onto a pedestrian crossing on Illawarra Road in Marrickville  in the early hours of March 9, 2013

As well as his life, Sherwood says he owes a large part of his miraculous recovery to the stranger.

'Just knowing that there was someone like her out there has helped me through this year - it’s given me faith to pull through,' he said, adding that it is only now that he has 'had the brain power' to be able to start properly looking for her.

Two weeks ago, he launched a community art project which he hopes will help him find 'M', as well as raise awareness about using mobile phones when crossing the road.

The project, called 'Look Out (For Each Other),' will involve street  and public art around Marrickville and Sydney's Inner-West from the end of December. 

But Sherwood is also appealing to the public to help him find 'M'  through a new Facebook page 'Finding my Hero'. His story was picked up by Sydney's popular 'Humans of Newtown' blog and Facebook page and Sherwood says he's touched by the hundreds of responses that have already come in from people he doesn't know. 

'Bits and pieces' of information have started coming through, he says, but he's still looking for his saviour that night.

'If she's in Sydney, word will have to reach her pretty soon!'

The incident occurred on March 9 2013, about 1.50am on Illawarra Rd, Marrickville.
