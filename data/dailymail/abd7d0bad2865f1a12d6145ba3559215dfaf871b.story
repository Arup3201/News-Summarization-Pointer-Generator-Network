Jason Duval, 39, stayed out of jail by paying bail with his $85 pair of Nike sneakers

A penniless Massachusetts man has just avoided being sent to jail for a few days by offering his Nike sneakers as bail.

Judge Douglas Stoddart, of Framingham District Court, told 39-year-old Jason Duval that he had to pay up outstanding court costs from a 2012 drug case or go to jail for a few days.

Duval had been arrested Thursday after he failed to cough up $450 from when he was charged with two counts of drug possession and driving to endanger, Metro West Daily News reported.

'I'll give you a chance to be creative,' the judge told Duval, according to the Daily News. 

'If you can come up with a creative idea to convince me that you'll come back, I'll work with you.'

Duval said he had no money while going through a divorce, but he also didn't want to take the second best option — going to jail for a few days in exchange for having his debt cleared.

All he had was a pair of $85 Nike sneakers he got for Christmas.

Judge Stoddart didn't hesitate.

'OK, we'll take them,' he told Duval, according to the Daily News.

Duval can get his shoes back if he pays the court $100 in four weekly installments beginning on Jan. 13.

Stoddart said he'd also give the sneakers back if Duval completes 10 hours of community service, according to the newspaper.
