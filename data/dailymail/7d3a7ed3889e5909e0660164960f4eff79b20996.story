Andy Murray has pledged he will continue to represent Great Britain next year despite his shock backing for the Scottish referendum Yes campaign.

Speaking exclusively to Sportsmail before the result of the vote was known, the former Wimbledon champion declared that he will definitely line up for GB when they take on the United States in the Davis Cup World Group first-round match in March.

‘I will be playing for Great Britain in the Davis Cup next year, that is for sure,’ he said. ‘As far as I’m concerned the vote doesn’t change anything in that regard.’

Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the union in an historic referendum on Thursday.

Judging by the reaction on social media to Murray’s backing for Scottish independence, the British public might not be so sure.

The 27-year-old Scot was practising at the All England Club on Thursday afternoon, and expanded on his surprise tweet from the early hours in which he came out in favour of independence.

He tweeted: ‘Huge day for Scotland today! No campaign negativity last few days totally swayed my view on it. Excited to see the outcome. Let’s do this!’

Thursday's Davis Cup draw gave Great Britain a plum home tie against America from March 6-8. The clash will be a re-match of this year’s first round in San Diego in which Murray led GB to victory.

And the Scot attempted to reassure British fans that he is not about to turn his back on the team, whatever his preferences in the vote.

‘As far as I’m concerned the vote doesn’t change anything in that regard,’ he insisted.

The issue of international representation is extremely complex in what is potentially an unprecedented situation, and Murray was unsure about what the future might hold in the event of a Yes vote. ‘There don’t seem to be a lot of answers about that, a lot of this is theoretical,’ he said.

Murray explained the lead-up to his tweet, which came after spending the previous year determinedly refusing to commit himself about the independence issue.

‘I’ve followed pretty much everything about it over the last two weeks, and especially in the last few days and that’s how I felt at the time,’ he said, before issuing an impassioned plea for Scots to act in solidarity whatever the outcome.

‘It’s not my decision, I can’t vote, it’s for the Scottish people to decide and I trust them to make the right decision,’ he said. ‘I will support whatever the outcome is. Regardless of how it goes I think it’s very important for everyone to come together and stick together afterwards.’

Murray came in for some fearful abuse on social media but clearly decided that was a price worth paying in order to express his feelings.

Comments under the MailOnline article were less than supportive.

On Thursday Murray was practising in unseasonably hot weather on Wimbledon’s hard courts clearly visible to the public.

In an intense two-hour session of drills he was put through his paces by assistant coach Dani Vallverdu and regular training partners Ross Hutchins and Colin Beecher. Fitness trainer Matt Little was also in attendance.

On Friday he leaves for China, where he will play tournaments in Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai in a bid to get back in the world’s top eight and qualify for the year-end Barclays ATP World Tour finals at London’s O2 Arena.
