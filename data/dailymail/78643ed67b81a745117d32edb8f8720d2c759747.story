Garry Monk insists his Swansea City side are not over-reliant on Wilfried Bony's goals.

Bony has supplied over a third of Swansea's Barclays Premier League goals, as well eight of the last 13, and captain Ashley Williams said after last weekend's 2-1 home defeat to Tottenham that they must find a way to lift the scoring burden on the Ivorian.

The 26-year-old's importance to Swansea could be underlined next month when he is away at the African Nations Cup, but Monk refutes the suggestion they are a one-man team.

'We're very much a collective here and it's not just about Wilfried scoring goals,' Monk said at his press conference ahead of Saturday's trip to Hull.

'The way we've produced the chances for Wilfried to contribute shows that.

'Yes, that's not to say there's six or seven players producing goals freely but look at the league and there's no massive amount of variation apart from the top teams.

'We create chances for each other and we don't care who scores as long as the team wins and we are creating those chances and someone's there to put in the back of the net.'

Monk must cover the absence of Bony and midfielder Ki Sung-yueng who is set to skipper South Korea at the 2015 Asian Cup in Australia next month following the New Year's day trip to QPR. The pair will not return to Swansea until the start of February.

Ki has been an ever-present in the league this season but Monk says he will only add players to his squad during the January transfer window if they are the right fit for the club.

'We've got a very good squad and I'm not going to be making wholesale changes at all,' Monk said.

'There are certain positions we will look to strengthen and if we can get the right player to fit into the squad that's the only time I'll do business.

'Other than that we'll go with what we've got. I've got full confidence in the squad right now and it's just adding quality to accompany what we've got.

'When Bony and Ki are out for that period it's for someone to step up to that level.'

Ninth-placed Swansea head to Hull on the back of two straight league defeats and the omens ahead of their trip to the Humber are not good.

They have failed to score on their three previous visits to the KC Stadium and a 1-0 defeat there in April ranks among one of their poorest performances under Monk.

But Hull have won only once at home all season and have dropped into the bottom two after going nine games without a win.

'Every team in this league is a different challenge, the way they set up and the different personnel and styles they have,' Monk said.

'It's getting your team to concentrate on themselves but adjust enough to know where the threats are from the other team.

'I would imagine they're looking at this game to turn around their form.

'They've got a very experienced manager who will be looking at how to get them back to winning ways and we expect a very difficult game.

'Hull will be different to what we've played before, so the challenge for us is to perform well enough to take the points.'
