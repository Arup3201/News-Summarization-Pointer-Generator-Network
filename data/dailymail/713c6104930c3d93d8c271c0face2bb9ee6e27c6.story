The child was taken ill at a home in Great Barr, Birmingham, this morning and was taken by ambulance to the city's children's hospital where she died after suffering a cardiac arrest.

Two women, aged 50 and 30, have been held by West Midlands Police.

The youngest is believed to be the girl's mother and the other is understood to be its grandmother.
