A British daredevil who ran up the 30-metre mast of his boat as it hung above the ocean at a 60-degree angle has described the the incredible stunt as 'the most stupid thing I've ever done'.

Alex Thomson, 37, clambered over ropes and rigging to reach the top in 16 seconds, before calmly putting his sunglasses in his pocket and plunging into the ocean near Cadiz in south-western Spain.

And as if the stunt wasn't impressive enough, the round-the-world yachtsman also did it in a stylish black suit.

He said: 'It wasn't safe at all. Only looking back do I really appreciate how dangerous it actually was.'

The weather and conditions had to be just so for the exploit to go ahead. The wind needed to be 18 to 20 knots so the boat could maintain a steady 10 knots.

An earlier attempt nearly ended in serious injury, despite two days of preparation. He was halfway up and the boat suddenly shifted direction and he was left hanging from the mast.

Alex Thomson has long established himself as one of the daredevils in the sport of sailing

Slick: Mr Thomson before the stunt, which took days of practice and waiting for the right conditions to pull off

He told CNN: 'Obviously falling from that height from the mast onto the deck isn't advisable. He drily added: 'The ramifications wouldn't have been great.'

In 2012, once again dressed suavely in black tie, he mounted the keel of his speeding sail boat in waters near the Isle of Wight.

If the keel had hit him - 4 tonnes of lead moving at 10mph â€“ it would be the equivalent of being charged by an elephant.

When he was 25, he became the youngest person to win a round the world race aboard the same vessel.
