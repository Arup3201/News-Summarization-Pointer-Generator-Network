Mark Allen got through to the Masters quarter-finals after emerging from a high-quality contest with former winner John Higgins.

The Northern Irishman was a 6-4 victor at Alexandra Palace but the scoreline did not tell the story of an outstanding tussle. The pair put on three centuries in the three opening frames, with another following later, as well as breaks of 96 and 88. Higgins also missed out on two maximum breaks, one faltering on the final yellow. 

It was a tough afternoon for the Scot, who took a 2-0 lead and scored 668 points but ended up on the wrong end of the result.

His slip-up on 120 in the ninth frame was the stand-out moment of misfortune. Attempting to match Marco Fu’s Sunday 147, he did not get high enough up for the yellow and had to take on a mid-ranger which rattled the jaws and spun out.

‘John has done most of the scoring,’ Allen, who posted a personal high of 121, told BBC2.

‘I have a good record against him recently and I just needed to hang in there. I stayed positive and did that.’

Allen has put himself on a strict fitness regime in 2015 in a bid to be more nimble around the table.

‘There’s certain shots out there which I can’t reach, I’m too fat,’ he added. ‘I need to lose weight.’

Allen has been in fine form this week at the Masters and next faces Joe Perry for a semi-final place
