Swansea City have been boosted by the news midfielder Leon Britton has taken another step forward in his recovery from a knee injury.

Britton is yet to make a competitive appearance this term after sustaining severe bruising on his knee during pre-season, but his training regime has been intensified this week.

A statement on Swansea's website on Thursday said: 'His recovery stepped up a gear this week as he is now going through running drills with a view of returning to first-team training soon.'

Britton, 32, has been an essential component in Swansea's midfield, particularly over the past two years, but his side have managed to make a fast start to their Premier League season without him.

Garry Monk's team opened their campaign by beating Manchester United at Old Trafford 2-1 in Louis van Gaal's first game in charge, and they are currently fifth in the table.

Britton will not be considered for the squad that travel to Stoke on Saturday, but Monk will hope he will be available in the coming weeks as he looks to build on their positive beginning.
