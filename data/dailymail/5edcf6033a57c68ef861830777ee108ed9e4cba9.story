From the top of the world to the exit door in seven short months, it has been an unstoppable slide for Andre Schurrle as he was caught up in Chelsea’s new reality.

As Schurrle he adjusts to new targets as a Wolfsburg player he may stop to wonder what has happened since his two goals in the World Cup semi-final and Germany’s glorious month in Brazil.

He returned in confident mood and scored in Chelsea’s opening game at Burnley what remains one of the best goals of this season, but things can change quickly in football and he has made way for Juan Cuadrado.

World Cup winner Andre Schurrle struggled to impress Jose Mourinho at Stamford Bridge

Schurrle was not Jose Mourinho’s selection, which is never a good starting point for a relationship between player and manager, although it does not mean it is doomed to fail. He was identified by Michael Emenalo’s scouting network before Mourinho returned to Stamford Bridge.

Chelsea had tried to sign him when Roberto di Matteo was in charge, soon after winning the Champions League, and stayed on his trail, but Mourinho gave the transfer his blessing and the German striker, fast, versatile, direct and industrious seemed a good fit for his tactical style.

When he first arrived in London, Thomas Tuchel, Schurrle’s coach and mentor through the youth ranks to the first team at Mainz, was certain he would excel in the high-pressure environment of the Barclays Premier League.

“He is an excellent team player who will dedicate his speed and skills to defending and able to decide matches with his offensive abilities,” said Tuchel. “You can be fast but he also has quick anticipation. He is half a second quicker in deciding and sees the situation before defending.”

There were memorable contributions: a hat-trick at Fulham, the first in a second-leg comeback against Paris St Germain and that delightful goal at Turf Moor on the opening day. It was the clinical finish the approach play deserved.

He also scored on his final appearance, as a sub in the 5-0 win at Swansea. By then his fate had been sealed. Perhaps his biggest obstacle was the fact he performed best from the left wing, a role with belongs to Eden Hazard.

He was a useful substitute to have but that did not appeal. Having started the season in the team, opportunities were drying up.

At Arsenal, Per Mertesacker spoke of motivational problems he felt after the World Cup triumph. At Chelsea, they pointed to a virus which knocked Schurrle’s fitness in October. Unlike Arsenal’s three world champions, he had reported back for pre-season after a truncated break and was flying at the start of the season.

Schurrle rejects the idea that this illness was anything other than a brief interruption. There have been no questions about his motivation. Mourinho simply seemed to have lost faith, hauling him off at half-time following a poor 45 minutes in Maribor in at the start of November.

The manager blamed the virus for a poor display, but the German has only started one Premier League game since, at Southampton during the fixture congestion around Christmas.

He has started only five times in the Premier League this season and Schurrle is not the type to sit happily on the bench. He was not homesick – he loved London – and there was no big bust-up. But, at 24, he wanted to play every week.

He met with his father Joachim and agent Ingo Haspel in November and decided to stick it out until the end of the season and then look for a transfer if nothing had changed. A month later, the trio met again. The situation seemed to have worsened and they agreed to accept a January move if the right one became available.

Mourinho has made a habit of selling players (like Lukau) for big money in order to shape his Chelsea squad

They were aware of interest from Germany and ambitious Wolfsburg is a challenge which appeals to Schurrle. He will not play tonight at Eintracht Frankfurt but he will be in contention at home against Hoffenheim on Saturday.

Was the situation contrived by Mourinho? Was he deliberately unsettled? It is conceivable. But this is the way football operates. Mourinho wanted Cuadrado and would have been aware of a buy-out clause in his Fiorentina contract which Chelsea could meet if they balanced the FFP figures by selling a player. Schurrle, a world champion in his mid-twenties on the fringe of the team, fitted the bill.

Juan Mata was another big money player that was allowed to leave Stamford Bridge for a sizable fee

Chelsea wanted £30m, Wolfsburg paid £24m with add-ons and Schurrle joined Juan Mata, Kevin de Bruyne, Romelu Lukaku and David Luiz and players to leave Stamford Bridge in their prime to generate big money to reshape the team.

Privately, Mourinho had reservations about all of them, either in terms of their character or their tactical suitability within the style he wants to play, which supports the idea for the time being that the manager’s opinion is prevailing in regard to who comes and goes at first-team level. This was not always the case in the years between his first spell and the club and his return in 2013.

As a footnote to the deadline-day departures from Chelsea, it is worth mention that the three players – Schurrle, Ashley Cole and Ryan Bertrand - who infuriated Mourinho by joining Arsenal players for their Christmas night out, 14 months ago, are no longer at the club.
