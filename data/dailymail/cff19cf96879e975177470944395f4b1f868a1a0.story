Campaign: Protester Mark Biddiss claims getting Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead to number one would be 'cathartic' for many

A protester behind a campaign to get anti-Thatcher song Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead to number one in the charts believes buying the July Garland hit is 'cathartic' for those who hated the Tory prime minister.

Mark Biddiss, 39, denies his cause is wrong and disrespectful to the Iron Lady, claiming: 'It is not about the song, it is giving people a voice'.

His campaign, backed by Left-wing agitators, has caused the song from the Wizard Of Oz to rise in the pop charts this week, and now sits at number three, MailOnline has learned.

As well as rising up the official charts, the track, which costs 79p online, is currently No1 on iTunes, and the BBC is planning to play the song on Sunday.

In the past, songs deemed to be too controversial have been banned from the airwaves by the BBC.

Meanwhile counter-protesters have today launched a late campaign to encourage people to buy: 'I'm In Love With Margaret Thatcher', a 1980 punk single by the Notsensibles.

'I am not an anarchist, and I am not going out to protest. This is a group of normal people who want be heard. I wanted to help this community,' Mr Biddiss told MailOnline.

'I feel a bit of sympathy for her. To have something like this marking her death shows how strongly feel about her.

'It is a comment about her as a state figure and what she did, not about her as a person or her family. People aren't having a go at her as an old lady.

'She never said sorry for anything she did. She did not make Britain great, she took a lot away from Britain.

'I think there is quite a tidal wave of emotion with this and it is a very cathartic experience for a lot of people who feel that for many years they haven't been listened to. I think they now feel they are being listened to.

'The big difference between this song and what Margaret Thatcher never did is listen to people. I don't think she even listened to her cabinet'.

Climbing up the charts: The Wizard Of Oz track which has had a surge of popularity in the wake of Baroness Thatcher's death is on course for a place in the top five

Online push: A message running on the Facebook group which has been set up to push the song to number one in this week's chart

Mr Biddiss, who describes himself as a
humourist, writer and event curator, criticised national newspapers who have been critical of his campaign, calling them 'out of 
touch'.

But he and the thousands who have been buying the pop song have been called 'feeble', 'deeply offensive' and 'disrespectful' by those against them.

Jonathan Aitken confronted Mr Biddiss on ITV's Daybreak this morning.

'I think this is a pretty feeble form of protest,' he said.

'The way to treat this is the way 
that Lady Thatcher would have treated it - to rise above it with dignity
and maybe some disdain.

'The one thing we shouldn't do is censor a song that which after all has been around for 50 years or more.

'This is an opportunistic move by a group of protesters to get a bit of publicity for them and their cause.

'People who have respect for Lady Thatcher and her views will not find this anything other than a distasteful affair.

'People have been listening to this 
song for decades. It is not new, what is new is that people like you are
trying to get cheap publicity.'

UKIP leader Nigel Farage said today: 'If you suppress things then you make them popular, so play the b***** thing. If you ban it it will be number one for weeks.

'Personally I think that the behaviour of these yobs - most of whom weren’t even born when Lady Thatcher was in power - is horrible, offensive and disgusting'.

Row: Mr Baddiss and former MP Jonathan Aitken clashed over the campaign on ITV's Daybreak this morning

Insiders confirmed yesterday that,
in a decision which will cause widespread outrage, Ding Dong! will 
feature in Radio 1's Sunday-evening Top 40 countdown.

Before it is played, it is planned to 
use a reporter from the BBC1 news programme Newsbeat to explain to the 
station's target audience of young listeners why the song has risen in 
the charts.

MPs from both Labour and the 
Conservative party united in saying it would be wrong to give airtime to
a song denigrating our greatest peacetime Prime Minister less than a 
week after her death.

The ruling comes after accusations of
'Left-wing bias' over the BBC's coverage of Lady Thatcher's death. It 
could be the first major leadership test for new director general Tony 
Hall, the chairman of the Culture Media and Sport select committee 
warned last night.

John Whittingdale said: 'This is an 
attempt to manipulate the charts by people trying to make a political 
point. Most people will find that offensive and deeply insensitive, and 
for that reason it would be better if the BBC did not play it. It's a 
political act.

The BBC will now need to decide if they will play the 1939 tune during Radio 1's top 40 countdown, hosted by Jameela Jamil, left.  It is still some distance behind the week’s biggest selling single, Need U (100%) by Duke Dumont , right, FT A*M*E

Place in the charts: The song is also on course to become the shortest top 10 single ever, with the most popular version running to 51 seconds

The power of a Facebook campaign should not be underestimated.

In 2009 a Facebook campaign was designed to prevent another X Factor number one.

As a consequence Rock band Rage Against the Machine won the most competitive battle in years for the Christmas number one.

The band's single, Killing In The Name, sold 500,000 downloads beating X Factor winner Joe McElderry's The Climb by 50,000 copies to clinch the top spot.

'Sometimes the BBC has taken the 
decision not to play a record because it is offensive, such as the Sex 
Pistols' God Save the Queen, but that is a matter for the director 
general, who will be appearing before my committee in two weeks.'

Labour backbencher Gerry Sutcliffe 
added: 'Obviously nobody wants censorship of music or culture but there 
has to be dignity in death. While I disagreed with everything she stood 
for, she was a leader and a Prime Minister so I don't think it would be a
good idea to promote that single.'

Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead was 
written for the soundtrack of the 1939 film The Wizard Of Oz and sung by
Judy Garland, who played Dorothy, the Munchkins and Glinda the Good 
Witch, played by Billie Burke.

The song, written by E.Y. Harburg and 
composed by Harold Arlen, is sung as they celebrate the death of the 
Wicked Witch of the East after Dorothy 'dropped a house on her'. It 
includes the lyrics: 'Wake up, the Wicked Witch is dead/She's gone where
the goblins go/Below, below, below.'

Since Lady Thatcher died on Monday, it
has become an anthem of hate for hordes of Left-wingers who have set up
Facebook pages encouraging their friends to buy it.

Supporters of Lady Thatcher urged the 
public to download Madonna's song True Blue – the Whitehall codename for
the preparations for her funeral – instead.

Decision: In what could be seen as the first major test for the new director general Tony Hall, the BBC will now have to take a decision about whether they will play the tune during Radio 1's top 40 countdown when places are finalised at the weekend

Conservative peer Baroness Buscombe 
said: 'So many of these people who are buying this song probably weren't
even alive when she was turning this country from being entirely broke,
with no future or prospects, into one giving us all hope and enterprise
and inspiration. I think it's a great shame if people think it's the 
right thing to do to dance on her death.'

Tory MP Henry Smith said it would be 
'silly and absurd' for the BBC to play the track on Sunday. He said: 
'The song is in particularly poor taste. If I was the person in charge 
of making the decision I would choose not to play that track. However, 
it is ultimately irrelevant. Margaret Thatcher's towering reputation 
will survive this. She was someone who stood for freedom of expression, 
so we can't ban these sick and misguided protests.'

Another Conservative MP, Philip Davies, defended the BBC's decision, saying it had a duty to play the song on its chart show.

He said: 'It's a chart programme so if
it's top of the charts they have to play it. It's not for the BBC to 
define on what basis something is in the charts.

'However I think this whole campaign 
is pretty pathetic really if the best these Left-wingers can achieve in 
their lives is to campaign for a song. Compared to Lady Thatcher's 
achievements around the world, it just shows what a fantastic Prime 
Minister she was that she defeated these people time and again and they 
are still bitter about it.'

In 1977 the BBC refused to play the 
Sex Pistols' anti-monarchy song God Save the Queen during the Silver 
Jubilee celebrations. It reached number one in the NME music magazine 
chart, but only number 2 in the official singles chart – selling 150,000
copies in its first week.

Yesterday BBC officials officially 
said no decision had yet been taken on whether to play Ding Dong! on the
chart show. However, the corporation did not deny an online Guardian 
report that a decision had been made to play it if it remains in the top
five.
