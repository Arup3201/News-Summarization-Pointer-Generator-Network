Outraged victims of Hurricane Sandy have been charged their normal electric bills despite not having any power at all - weeks after the devastating storm.

Customers of Long Island Power Authority received their usual full estimated rate that covered the entire billing cycle and the statements made no reference to refunds or deductions because or in spite of Sandy.

Other residents of the areas affected by the storm have suffered an even worse blow, as a spate of burglaries hit the region over the Thanksgiving holiday.

Jonathan Saporta of Great Neck stands with his bill that charged him for a full cycle of power even though he had no power for 15 days

Victims of Robbery: The ruins of burned out homes are framed by surviving buildings in the Breezy Point section of the Queens borough of New York, today.

One man, Jonathan Saporta 
had the misfortune to get two bills from the power company - one for 
$649 for the Long Beach home that he had to leave in October and another
$281 demand for the new home he has set up in Great Neck.

'I can’t get LIPA to acknowledge my existence on earth to talk to me about anything,' said Saporta to the New York Post. 'But I guess they had power, so they could print my bills. Nice, right?'

The beleaguered restaurateur moved to the Great Neck home on October 1st and was sent a bill for a full 43-day cycle that included the two weeks he spent without power following the October 29th storm.

'I am not paying any of my bills, that much I promise,' said Saporta. 'They can put me into collections, and I’ll fight them tooth-and-nail. It’s simply criminal.'

Another man, Michael Hilferty, 29, an attorney from Long Beach received a bill via email, which the power company worked out as being one dollar more than the previous month.

'To get this message on Thanksgiving was crass and classless. It’s just heartless,' he said.

The lawyer suffered seven feet of flooding into his oceanfront home and was blasted with four feet of sand.

He has not lived in the property since October 29th, yet was sent a bill for a full 29 days of electricity  usage.

This comes as more misery was piled on for Sandy victims as some residents of Breezy Point, the neighbourhood that suffered fire and flooding during Superstorm Sandy say thieves looted their damaged houses over Thanksgiving.

One couple lost a $25,000 coin collection along with jewelry and watches.

The break-ins occurred on Wednesday or Thursday when many residents were away for the holiday.

'I’ve been putting my best efforts 
forward into putting my home back together and staying strong,' said one
affected Queens resident, Robert Bainbridge, 57. 'This just adds insult
to injury.

'Whoever did this is not thinking, "This could happen to me."'

Another victim of the break-ins called them a 'terrible violation' while one woman who did not want to be named said, 'It's just been one big ordeal.'

The couple who lost their $25,000 silver half dollars told the New York Post they were more upset by the loss of their pair of stolen watches.

One was a gift from the husband to his wife and the other was given to the husband by his employer on the day of his retirement.

'Those are more sentimental to me,' he said to the New York Post. 'People aren’t here during the week, so when they come back on the weekend, they notice their stuff is gone.'

Explaining their shock and disappointment, the couple revealed that in the last 30 years they had not been robbed once.
