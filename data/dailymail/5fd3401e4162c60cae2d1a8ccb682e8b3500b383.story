To foreigners, it is endearing if not a little baffling – the ultra-polite British habit of apologising for things that are not necessarily our fault.

Now a study has found that saying a superfluous ‘I’m sorry’ makes us appear more trustworthy.

The stereotype of the continually apologetic Brit, as depicted by actor Hugh Grant, has become a romantic comedy staple, amusing our American friends who clearly see the trait as a weakness.

Unnecessary apologies feature heavily in the film FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL, starring Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell (pictured), and now researchers have discovered that apologising for situations an individual is powerless to change, makes them appear more trustworthy to others

Their own experts now suggest this could be far from the case.

Researchers
 at Harvard Business School have discovered there are in fact 
‘significant’ advantages to apologising for problems beyond our control –
 such as travel delays, a noisy restaurant or simply when someone else 
carelessly knocks into you.

Alison
 Wood Brooks, assistant professor of business administration and lead 
author of the study, said: ‘Superfluous apologies represent a powerful 
and easy-to-use tool for social influence.

Even in the absence of 
culpability, individuals can increase trust and liking by saying “I’m 
sorry” – even if they are merely sorry about the rain.’

The
 study, co-authored with the University of Pennsylvania, used a number 
of experiments to gauge the usefulness of the gratuitous ‘sorry’. In one
 test, a male actor approached 65 strangers – 30 of them women – at a 
rain-swept train station and asked to borrow their mobile phone.

In one of the experiments a male actor approached 65 strangers on a rainy day and asked to borrow their mobile phone. Demonstrating the power of an apology, half of the strangers offered to lend him their phone if he apologised for the weather, compared with only nine per cent when he asked straight out

Half the time he simply made the request and the other half he prefaced it by saying: ‘I’m sorry about the rain!’

Almost half the strangers lent him their phone when he apologised – but just 9 per cent agreed to do so when he did not.

The
 same trend emerged during a laboratory experiment, in which 177 adults 
watched a video of a stranger approaching a delayed passenger at an 
airport and asked to borrow his or her phone.

Many more said they would lend the phone if the stranger apologised over the flight delay.

In
 another experiment, 178 students were told they were playing a 
financial computer game with a partner sitting in another room.

They were warned the computer would sometimes override their decisions.

Whenever
 this happened and their partner apologised for the computer, the 
student tended to rate him or her as more trustworthy, and became more 
generous towards them.

Another experiment found that people were more willing to lend their mobile phones to someone who apologised for a flight delay before asking to make a call than someone who simply asked for a favour

In a series of experiments, people were more likely to lend a stranger a phone if they apologied for an unrelated event before asking for the favour
