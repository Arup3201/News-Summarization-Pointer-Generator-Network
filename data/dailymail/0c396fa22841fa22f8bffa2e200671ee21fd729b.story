An illegal immigrant has been arrested after allegedly using a forged passport to get a job at the House of Commons.

The woman, believed to be from Sierra Leone, had been working in the Palace of Westminster for two months as a casual member of the catering team when the discovery was made. 

The employee, who had been supplied by an external recruitment agency, was arrested on Friday over the alleged security breach.

According to The Times, the woman was required to be escorted around Parliament at all times, due to the fact she was a casual employee.

But there were reports that she was allowed to roam free by allegedly using a pass owned by another member of staff. 

The woman's role in catering would have given her access to senior ministers and MPs.  

It is believed the agency was responsible for carrying out the background checks on the employee.

A spokesman for the Commons confirmed the arrest, saying: 'A worker for an agency contracted by the House of Commons was arrested by the Metropolitan Police on Friday, January 2.

'We cannot comment on ongoing police investigations.'

The incident will raise serious questions about Parliament's security system.

Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said there needed to be a proper inquiry about how it happened, while Mark Field, a Tory member of the intelligence and security committee, said it was a 'pretty depressing' discovery. 

The case has echoes of another security blunder in 2008, when a Brazilian woman Elaine Chaves Aparecida, who had been hired as a cleaner, was arrested after trying to enter parliament using another person's security pass.

In a separate incident in 2010, a Nigerian woman was found to have worked for six months in the House of Lords catering team while living illegally in Britain. 

Last February, one of Theresa May's ministers Mark Harper resigned after discovering his Colombian cleaner did not have permission to work in the UK.
