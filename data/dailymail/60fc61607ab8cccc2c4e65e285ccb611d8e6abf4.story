Barcelona coach Luis Enrique has decided to rest Lionel Messi, Neymar and most of his regulars for the Copa del Rey last 16, second leg match at Elche on Thursday night.

Barca have a 5-0 lead from last week's first leg at the Nou Camp and Luis Enrique has called up six players from the B team, including teenage Croatia midfielder Alen Halilovic for the return game.

Playmaker Xavi and defender Thomas Vermaelen will miss the match due to injury, while centre back Gerard Pique and midfielder Ivan Rakitic are the only players included who featured in Sunday's 3-1 La Liga win at home to Atletico Madrid.

Sevilla, Athletic Bilbao, Villarreal, Malaga, Espanyol and Getafe are already through to the last eight.
