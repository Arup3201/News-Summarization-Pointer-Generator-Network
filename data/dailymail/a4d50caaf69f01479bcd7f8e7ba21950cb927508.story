Gareth Southgate named a strong England U21 squad for next week's games against the Czech Republic and Germany.

Southgate has plenty of Premier League stars, including several with senior caps and those on the fringes of the first team squad.

Strike pair Danny Ings and Saido Berahino were both thought of as contenders for Roy Hodgson's squad, while Jack Butland will play for the Young Lions while also acting as cover for the first team.
