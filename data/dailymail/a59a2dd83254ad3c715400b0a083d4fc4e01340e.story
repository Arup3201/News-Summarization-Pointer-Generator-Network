French defender Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa has sealed a season-long loan move to Roma from Newcastle.

Yanga-Mbiwa arrived at Rome's Fiumicino Airport on Monday to undergo a medical and finalise the deal.

'An agreement has been signed with Newcastle United to acquire the player Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa on a temporary basis, until June 30, 2015, for a payment of £1million,' a statement on Roma's website confirmed on Monday evening.

Agreement: Roma will make Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa's move permanent in the summer

'The agreement also includes the option to buy the player outright, from the 2015/2016 season, for a total value of £5.5million.'

The 25-year-old had been looking to leave the Magpies this summer after finding himself down the pecking order under manager Alan Pardew.

'I am happy, forza Roma,' Yanga-Mbiwa was reported as saying by the Italian press earlier.

The France international moved to St James' Park in January 2013 from Ligue 1 side Montpellier.

The move to Roma, who won their Serie A opener 2-0 against Fiorentina on Saturday, will allow Yanga-Mbiwa to play Champions League football.

Roma finished runners-up in Italy's top flight last season and will face Manchester City, Bayern Munich and CSKA Moscow in the group stages of Europe's elite club competition.

The Italian club also confirmed on Monday that highly-rated 19-year-old defender Alessio Romagnoli was heading to Sampdoria on a season-long loan.

Former Arsenal and England defender Ashley Cole also signed for the club in the summer following his release by Chelsea.
