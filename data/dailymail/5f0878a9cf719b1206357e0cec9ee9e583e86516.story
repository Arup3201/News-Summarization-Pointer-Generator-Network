The First Daughter’s recent work experience gig as a production assistant 
on Halle Berry's new TV show Extant has received a host of glowing 
reports about her behavior and demeanor.

Malia
 Obama, who turns 16 on July 4, spent last week working as a runner on 
the set of the sci-fi series which is being produced by prominent 
President Obama donor Steven Spielberg.

According
 to sources on set, the 15-year-old received no special treatment and 
carried out the kinds of menial tasks that anyone who wants to make it behind the cameras in Hollywood has 
to endure.

Malia
 spent most of her day going on runs for coffee and drinks for the cast 
and also helped the crew by blocking people from walking through scenes 
during shooting, reports TMZ.

As
 a member of the first family she did have Secret Service protection on 
hand, but they kept out of sight and didn’t cause any scenes.

One person, apparently unaware of who the 
new girl was, innocently chatted to her about sports and she never blew her cover.

The show, which debuts on CBS on July 9, had it's Los Angeles premiere on Monday night.

In Extant, Hallie Berry plays an astronaut who returns home from a year-long solo mission in space and tries to reconnect with her husband and son

Extant star Camryn Manheim has confirmed that Malia had been onset and had nothing but glowing things to say about her

Present was TV veteran and star, Camryn Manheim, who confirmed that Malia had been onset and had nothing but glowing things to say about her.

‘I
 can tell you that [Malia] is graceful, and lovely, and just charming 
and delightful… She's pretty remarkable. I mean, they are a remarkable 
family,’ she told ET.

Manheim continued to praise the first daughter and said her kindness was all the
 more impressive considering she has been raised in the public eye.

‘When
 you get hoisted into the spotlight like that, and you grow up under the
 scrutiny of everybody, and to come out being so charming and in charge 
of herself, with so much poise, it's beautiful.’

The actress added, ‘Any parent would look at her and be proud.’

Extant is being produced by Steven Spielberg, who presented President Barack  with an Ambassador for Humanity Award earlier this year

In the series, Berry plays an 
astronaut who returns home from a year-long solo mission in space and 
tries to reconnect with her husband and son. Her experiences in space and home lead to events that ultimately change the course of human history.

Malia attends the exclusive Sidwell Friends private school in Washington, DC, but classes let out earlier this month.

President Obama, Michelle and Malia enjoyed a four-day weekend in southern California, staying at a private residence inside the gated community of Thunderbird Heights, in the high-end city of Rancho Mirage.

The President and First Lady flew in Friday. Obama delivered the commencement address at the University of California, Irvine, on Saturday before attending a fundraiser in Orange County.

Sasha Obama apparently did not make the Father’s Day weekend trip, which was expected to include golfing and perhaps some house-hunting for the Obamas, reports Press Enterprise.

At Saturday's commencement address, the President said denying climate change is like arguing the moon is made of cheese.

Obama issued the call to the tens of thousands gathered at Angel Stadium even though he said Congress 'is full of folks who stubbornly and automatically reject the scientific evidence' and say climate change is a hoax or fad.

Obama said others duck the question.

'They say, "Hey, look, I'm not a scientist." And I'll translate that for you: what that really means is, "I know that manmade climate change really is happening but if I admit it, I'll be run out of town by a radical fringe that thinks climate science is a liberal plot,'" he said.

Obama also used the address to announce a
 $1 billion competitive fund for communities who have experienced 
natural disasters to rebuild and prepare for the impact of extreme 
weather.

He described a political system consumed by 'small things' but said Americans should be determined to do 'big things' like addressing climate change, despite the type of opposition he faces from Congress.

'There's going to be a stubborn status quo and people determined to stymie your efforts to bring about change. There are going to be people who say you can't do something. There are going to be people who say you shouldn't bother trying. I've got some experience with this myself,' Obama said.

'It's pretty rare that you'll encounter somebody who says the problem you're trying to solve simply doesn't exist.

'When
 President Kennedy set us on a course to the moon, there were a number 
of people who made a serious case that it wouldn't be worth it,' he 
continued.

While in Orange County, Obama also raised
 money for the Democratic National Committee at a closed-door fundraiser
 at the Laguna Beach home of Getty oil heiress Anne Earhart. About 25 
people paid up to $32,400 to participate in a roundtable discussion with
 the president.
