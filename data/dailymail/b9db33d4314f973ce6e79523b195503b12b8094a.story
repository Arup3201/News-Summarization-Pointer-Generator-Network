Emmanuel Adebayor is set to kickstart his pre-season with Tottenham on Saturday after recovering from malaria.

The 30-year-old contacted the disease in July after feeling unwell before being admitted to hospital where he was diagnosed.

As a result, the Togo international missed Spurs' pre-season of North America after he was advised not to travel on medical grounds.

Back in action: Emmanuel Adebayor has returned to Tottenham training after recovering from malaria

However, the forward will now get the chance to impress new Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino after being named in the club's squad for their next friendly against Celtic.

Adebayor enjoyed a fine season last term after Tim Sherwood replaced Andre Villas-Boas in the White Hart Lane hotseat and will look to recapture that form against the Scottish champions.

Spurs' clash against Celtic takes place in Finland on Saturday at Helsinki's Olympic Stadium.
