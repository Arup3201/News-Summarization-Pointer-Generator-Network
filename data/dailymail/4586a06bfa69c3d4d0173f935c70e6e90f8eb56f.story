A woman thought to be Iranian dared to take off her head scarf while dancing in a YouTube video.

Onlookers can be heard commenting and clapping in the background as she takes out her hair and dances on top of a car, Fox News noted. 

The news channel reported that it has not been confirmed if the woman is actually from Iran, where women are required by law to wear head coverings, called hijabs - but if true, her safety may be at risk.

Dance: The woman, who may be Iranian, is seen dancing and taking off her hijab in the popular video 

Carefree: After her hijab is removed, the woman continues to dance and toss her hair 

She later tosses her hair in the wind and she continues to move her hands and shake her hips. The video appears to be filmed in a desert.

A small handful of English-language Twitter users have praised the woman.

Tweets included 'This woman is my soul sister!!!' 'Werk it, girl!!' and 'U go girl.'

Other Twitter users called the woman 'brave.'

Explaining the video's popularity, Krista Nassi, an artist, told Fox News 'People are always interested in seeing the forbidden.'

Nassi, who is Iranian, cited the Iranian government and also said 'The work I do there is completely different from what I do [in Los Angeles].'

In May, The Daily Dot reported that Iranian women were posting selfies on social media without their hijabs and using #mystealthyfreedom as a hashtag.

Earlier this summer, Iranians were arrested and later freed after they were taped dancing to 'Happy' by Pharrell Williams, Fox pointed out.

Get down: The performance apparently took place on top of a car
