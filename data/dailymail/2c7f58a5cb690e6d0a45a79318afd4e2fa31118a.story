The leader of pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine has issued a bizarre appeal for British help via UKIP leader Nigel Farage.

Denis Pushilin, head of the self-declared 'Donetsk people's republic', sent his plea as Ukrainian forces arrived to crush an uprising against the country's new, pro-EU government.

In an email he told Mr Farage that Donetsk was founded by a British engineer and businessman John Hughes in 1870, after he was granted a concession by the Russian government under tsar Alexander II.

Nigel Farage, leader of UKIP, is the unlikely recipient of a plea for help from Denis Pushilin, the leader of the self-declared 'Donetsk People's Republic' which has staged a revolt against Ukraine's pro-EU government

'We are appealing not just to fellow Russians, but to the people of Britain,' said Mr Pushilin.

'We believe that Britons, like Russians, are not "of Europe" - as Winston Churchill put it - and will not be "with" Ukrainian ultra-nationalists, the EU, US and NATO in repressing our identity, our right to speak Russian and our desire to be with Russia as well as to celebrate our historical Russo-British heritage.

'On behalf of the overwhelming majority of the people of Donetsk, we are asking for your support for a referendum on the independence of Donetsk Region.

'We believe that UKIP represents the spirit of the British people more than any other party, and are issuing a "Mayday" distress signal.

'The danger of our potential extermination by the Kiev "authorities" is hanging over us and anybody, who holds the same views, like a sword of Damocles.'

The breakaway leader - who has strong support in Russia - declared: 'We are hoping that you and the people of Britain will respond to our appeal and help Donetsk to defend the right to keep its own identity and our lives, which are endangered by the new "government" in Kiev.

'Please stand up for us, like the statue of John Hughes in the centre of our city, a testament to our special relationship, which doesn't have to be a thing of the past. Let us all have a future.'

Mr Pushilin confirmed that his appeal was genuine. MailOnline contacted UKIP for comment, but no one was available.

Last month Mr Farage was accused of being an apologist for Putin after he claimed the EU had 'blood on its hands' over Ukraine.

Founder: John Hughes was a Welsh engineer who came to the region in 1870 and for many years Donetsk was named after him - as Hughesovka

Mr Pushilin's 'Donetsk People's Republic' is seen by Kiev and the West as a tool by separatists to help the Russian secret services split east Ukraine from the rest of the country, and put it fully under Moscow's sway.

He and his supporters have occupied the main regional government building for ten days, and declared the Donetsk People's Republic with a central demand of a referendum on their future status.

They are protected by barricades and armed gunmen wearing balaclavas.

His supporters are split between those wanting autonomy within Ukraine and others seeking immediate incorporation by Russia.

'One thing is clear, there will be no May 25 presidential elections for us,' said Mr Pushilin, referring to Kiev's plans for a national poll to elect a new government.

Hughes was a Welsh engineer and for many years Donetsk was named after him - as Hughesovka.

Later in 1924 it was renamed Stalino after Soviet leader Josef Stalin.

Welshman Hughes was born in Merthyr Tydfil and as an an engineer won acclaim for his armaments designs.

After switching to the Millwall Iron Works in London, where he designed a gun carriage for heavy cannons, used by the Royal Navy, he received an order from the Russian Imperial government.

He was granted land in what is now Donetsk, taking with him around 100 ironworkers and miners from South Wales.

He personally established hospitals, schools, bath houses, tea rooms, a fire brigade and an Anglican church in his new town, now a city of almost one million.
