Women look set to be welcomed into the world’s most exclusive golf club, ending its men-only status after 260 years.

The hugely powerful Royal & Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, which also serves as the sport’s governing body, has written to all 2,500 of its current members recommending they agree to allow women to join.

St Andrews has repeatedly resisted mounting political and commercial pressure to overhaul the admissions policy at its clubhouse, which overlooks the 18th green of the Old Course – the spiritual home of golf.

But in an extraordinary volte-face, Wilson Sibbet, chairman of the club’s influential General Committee, has written to members with a clear message that they should accept the change as inevitable.

He writes that ‘now is the time to ask members of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club to welcome female members into the club.’

The letter continues: ‘It is of course for members to decide if they wish to alter the rules of the club to give effect to this change of policy. 

The General Committee sincerely hopes that this rules change will be enthusiastically supported.’

The unexpected development is likely to generate enormous international interest because the R&A acts as the rule-making body of golf.

The letter will be posted this week to members, including James Bond star and keen golfer Sir Sean Connery, three-times Open winner Jack Nicklaus, and Herbert Kohler, the American tycoon and owner of the Old Course Hotel.

There will be a discussion at the club’s spring meeting about letting women members in, followed by a vote in the autumn.

Women were denied membership in a previous vote, but it is hoped pressure from the top of the club will result in a different outcome this time.

The move follows outrage levelled at the R&A for allowing clubs hosting the Open Championship to continue to exclude women.

Last summer, trouble flared after Muirfield near Edinburgh, which operates a male-only policy, staged the tournament. First Minister Alex Salmond refused to attend.

The furore prompted the R&A’s chief executive Peter Dawson to speak about a ‘direction of travel’ leading the game away from the practice of excluding women.

In January, a major sponsor of the Open heaped further pressure on the governing body, saying it wanted the problem of men-only institutions hosting the championship ‘solved’ so that it did not have to ‘justify’ its financial support for the tournament.

Giles Morgan, head of sponsorship at HSBC, said: ‘I think things are moving. It’s not something we are going to put a gun to anyone’s head over, but we would like to see it solved so we don’t keep talking about it.’
