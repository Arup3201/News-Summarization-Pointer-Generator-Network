They've been underpinning style since 1886 and lingerie makers Triumph have proved they still remain at the forefront of fashion after being named as the official supplier of underwear at London Fashion Week.

To celebrate their second collaboration with the British Fashion Council, Triumph have teamed up with designers including Matthew Williamson and  Fyodor Golan who have created their own unique customisations of their underwear.

The designers' styles will be on display at a special pop up event, 'Maison Triumph', in Covent Garden, London next week. But for fashionistas not able to get to the capital, Femail have been given a sneak pic of some of the designs which you can view below.

The pop up centre will also house an 
exhibition revealing Triumph's styles across the decades since they were
established in 1886 by merchant Michael Braun and corset-maker Johann 
Gottfried Spiesshofer.

From humble beginnings with
just six sewing machines and six employees at their factory in southern
Germany, they have gone on to become the world's leading lingerie 
manufacturers with a presence in more than 120 countries and 37,500-plus employees.

In
the beginning, their production focused on corsets that emphasised the 
bust and derriere while tautly shaping the waist and hips in line with 
what was considered the perfect female shape during the Victorian era.

The
company faced a challenge to their business in the 1920s when the 
corset began to fall out of favour as female fashion began to change 
radically and boyish shapes and the bra became more popular.

They moved with the times and began 
developing new ranges of underwear including bras with front fastenings 
and adjustable straps.

More than a century ago: The brand began creating corsets in line with demand for women to have nipped in waists

Evolving style: The company has had to move with the times and changes in fashion - a London exhibition next week will chronicle the journey

Further developments in line with 
style tastes, their own innovations and incorporating new fabrics like 
Lycra, continued through the swinging sixties to the present day - with 
their signature corsets continually coming in and out of fashion again.

Visitors
to the pop event can see this style evolution played out in the 
exhibition that includes some of the images you can view here.

There will also be a number of other special events at the pop up store including a question and answer sessions with industry experts including model-turned-designer Helena Christensen, who will unveil a sneak peek of her autumn/winter collection for the brand.

And of course visitors won't have to leave empty-handed as they'll be able to shop the look with capsule collections available to purchase.
