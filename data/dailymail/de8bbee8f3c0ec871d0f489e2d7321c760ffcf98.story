It's the time when people start talking about awards, but there is no question Liverpool should win the double. 

Luis Suarez has been magnificent and Brendan Rodgers is a class act.

They are the player and manager of the year. Liverpool had success under Gerard Houllier and Rafa Benitez, but never played with the same style as Rodgers’ side.

Last year they were 28 points off the
 title and now they lead by two. That is an incredible turnaround. Glen 
Johnson said it would be good for neutrals if Liverpool won the title, 
but it would be great for English football full stop.

They play such fantastic football with a British manager and Sunday had six Englishmen in their starting XI.

Suarez and Rodgers should win the individual awards, but they will want to make it a magnificent treble with the title.

MOURINHO ON THE DEFENSIVE

You would expect Arsenal to play two defensive midfielders against Manchester City, but it was a surprise to see Jose Mourinho do it against Crystal Palace.

He was without the suspended Ramires, and playing Nemanja Matic made sense because he is cup-tied for Wednesday’s Champions League game, but Tony Pulis will have been pleased to see Oscar and Willian on the bench.

No hope? Jose Mourinho believes his Chelsea side stand no chance of pipping City or Liverpol to the title

Starting Matic and David Luiz played into Palace’s hands.

They relished the midfield battle rather than having to deal with Chelsea’s smaller playmakers, and Mile Jedinak was so strong.

The result showed it’s not just big head-to-heads that can win you the title. Of the top three, only Liverpool have not lost a game to one of the bottom five.

RECORD RUSS

A special mention to Scunthorpe’s Russ Wilcox, who set a Football League record on Saturday. After a 0-0 draw with Wycombe, Wilcox has gone 24 games without defeat, the most by a new boss.

With Scunthorpe second in League Two, he could be extending that in League One next season.

MARTINEZ WOULD LOVE EURO CASH

Everton are doing their part to keep up the Merseyside revival. Roberto Martinez is another exciting manager who has his team playing good, stylish football.

With another win, next week’s game against Arsenal is now massive. 

Finishing in the top four and qualifying for the Champions League would be so important for them.

A lot of their success this season has been built on loans — Romelu Lukaku, Gareth Barry, Gerard Deulofeu.

And with Champions League money in the bank, they might just be able to make the signings permanent.

ARSENAL'S MAIN MIDDLE MAN

When Arsenal lost 6-0 to Chelsea, Mathieu Flamini spent the first half on the bench. By the time he came on, his side were 4-0 down.

Fighter: Flamini was Arsenal's stand-out performer against Manchester City at the Emirates

Mathieu Flamini covered more ground than any other player at the Emirates. Mikel Arteta, at 32 the oldest midfielder on the pitch, was second.

Mathieu Flamini: 8.4milesMikel Arteta: 7.5Santi Cazorla: 7.2Fernandinho: 7.1Yaya Toure: 6.9

Against Manchester City, he gave the 
midfield the legs they needed.

He ruffled a few feathers, too, nicking a
 goal and providing energy.

Mikel Arteta is a good playmaker, but looks much better with Flamini alongside him.

Against Chelsea, their attacking midfielders closed Arteta then sprang off the back of him and Arsenal couldn’t cope.

Flamini helps close things up against powerful midfields, and there is none more powerful than City’s.

For years Arsenal have struggled against stronger sides because they are not good enough without the ball.

Is Flamini the long-term solution?

No, but, with him in the side, Arsenal look a much more solid outfit.

ODEMWINGIE'S LAUGHING NOW

When he turned up in the QPR car park looking for a transfer, Peter Odemwingie was a bit of a laughing stock, but now he’s proving his quality.

He has scored in three games in a row and Stoke have won them all. He works well with Peter Crouch and, with his side playing good football, Mark Hughes could lead Stoke to their first top-10 Premier League finish.

They played brilliantly at Aston Villa last weekend and have a great home record — eight wins and just two defeats.

HOTSHOT WAYNE

Wayne Rooney is now fourth in the all-time Premier League scorers list. He is four goals away from Thierry Henry and 16 off Andy Cole, but can he beat Alan Shearer’s 260?

At this rate, Rooney would have to play for seven more seasons to get there. It’s not impossible for somebody of his quality.
