Tributes: Warrant Officer Class 2 (WO2) Ian Michael Fisher from the 3rd Battalion The Mercian Regiment (Staffords) who was killed in a suicide blast while on patrol in Afghanistan

A ‘hugely experienced’ British  
soldier killed in a suicide attack in Afghanistan was named last night 
as Sergeant Major Ian Fisher.

The married father of two died when a vehicle packed with explosives rammed his Warrior fighting vehicle on Tuesday.

The
42-year-old officer had been deployed to the warzone in August. He was 
on his second tour of  Afghanistan and had also served in Northern 
Ireland and Iraq.

Warrant Officer Class 2 Fisher, 42, was on the final day of a two-day operation to disrupt insurgent activity near Kamparak, 25 miles north east of the provincial capital Lashkar Gah when the attack took place.

He was taken to the military hospital at Camp Bastion but later died from his injuries.

Yesterday, his widow Emma paid tribute to the father-of-two.

She said: 'Ian will always be the centre of my 
life, he will be remembered as a doting father, loving husband and a 
true professional soldier.

'He loved being a soldier, that's what he lived for. We are all so proud and always will be.'

His death takes the number of UK 
service members who have lost their lives since operations in 
Afghanistan began in October 2001 to 446 and he is the eighth to die this year.

WO2 Fisher, who worked as a Sergeant Major for a company of Warrior fighting vehicles, was a physics and geology graduate, who was born in Barking in Essex.

He joined the Territorial Army in February 1993 with B Company, 3 Staffords, based in Stoke-on-Trent.

He completed four previous operational tours from 1999 - once to Northern Ireland, twice to Iraq and a previous tour of Afghanistan in 2011.

As well as his wife Emma, he leaves behind two sons, James, seven, and William, five, and his parents, Simon and Helen.

The Ministry of Defence said that WO2 Fisher's colleagues described him as 'the epitome of an Infantry Sergeant Major, straight talking and obsessive in his pursuit of excellence and gaining the most from his subordinates while ensuring their wellbeing'.

Lieutenant Colonel Chris Davies, Commanding Officer of WO2 Fisher's regiment, said: 'To lose a soldier in combat is a tragedy that hits any unit hard but to lose a warrant officer of WO2 Ian Fisher's calibre and standing in such a tight knit family regiment is a huge blow that has left the whole battalion numb.

'Qualified in both light role and armoured iInfantry, it was his expertise on Warrior fighting vehicles that set WO2 Fisher apart from his peers and for which he was widely respected as one of the best of his generation across the Army.

'Ian will always be the centre of my 
life, he will be remembered as a doting father, loving husband and a 
true professional soldier.'

Emma Fisher

'His reputation as a tough-talking, no-nonsense sergeant major belied his quick wit and mischievous sense of humour and his men loved him for it.

'A larger-than-life character, he played a pivotal role in battalion life, always at the forefront where there was fun to be had.

'His nickname of "the Colonel" epitomised him. He was the consummate professional, never happier than when leading from the front and making things happen. Hugely popular, he is already sorely missed.'

Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: 'It is with great sadness that I learned of the death of Warrant Officer Class 2 Ian Fisher.

'It is clear from the tributes from his colleagues that he was an exemplary soldier who made a huge contribution to the Army over many years, on a number of operational tours.

'My thoughts and deepest condolences are with his family and friends.'
