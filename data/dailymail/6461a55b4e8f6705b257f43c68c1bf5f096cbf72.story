A 61-year-old janitor has revealed how he walks 35 miles to his night shift job so he can afford to provide for his sick wife.

Steven Simoff works at the Lakeside Casino in Osceola, Iowa, but lives in Davis City, more than six hours on foot down the bleak Interstate Highway 35.

In order to get to work for his 11pm shift he leaves his home at 3.30pm and walks alongside four lanes of thundering traffic in sun, rain, wind or snow.

Feet of endurance: Steven Simoff works as an overnight janitor at Lakeside Casino in Osceola, Iowa, but lives in Davis City, Iowa - 35 miles away. To get to work for his 11pm shift he leaves his home at 3.30pm

Devoted husband: Steven Simoff kisses his wife, Renee, goodbye. 'You've got to keep your job', he said.

Simoff lives with his wife, Renee, who receives Supplemental Security Income and their 22-year-old grandson, Steven, who is currently unemployed. 

Money has been tight since Renee suffered a stroke nine years ago. She has also had a couple of heart attacks.

Earning $9.07 an hour in his casino job, Simoff says his family can't afford to live closer to work  because their rent in Davis City is just $400 per month.

Simoff owns a 2002 Ford Windstar minivan, but says he can rarely afford to buy gas for it.

'First of all, when you got a family, and you've got a job, you've got to be able to support your family. And you've got to keep your job — the most two important things I can think of,' he told the Des Moines Register.

Simoff's daily trek beats that undertaken by James Robertson, 56, from Detroit who received a $350,000 from a GoFundMe campaign and a new Ford Taurus after his plight received national media attention.

Although Simoff's journey is longer, he told the Register that he can typically catch a lift three out of five days. 

He works Thursday-to-Tuesday and says that Sundays are typically the worst for trying to catch a lift.

His frugal approach has its drawbacks, however - he has to buy a new pair of shoes every two months.

Going the distance: The extent of Simoff's commute is made clear compared to the scale of Iowa

On average Simoff spends nearly four hours a day walking to work.

'It all depends on weather and what people feel like that day, if they're going to stop and pick you up,' he said.

On his way home, Simoff is able to hitch a ride most of the way home with a co-worker who lives in Leon, leaving him eight miles to walk. 

'He's trying to earn a living,' said Emil Segebart, who has been giving rides to Simoff for a decade.

'That's how I look at it. You're trying to earn a living and doing what it takes. And this is what it takes.'

Once in work Simoff has to spend his eight-hour shift on his feet cleaning the casino, except for two 15-minute breaks and a half hour for a meal.

Despite his advancing years he says he's never been injured while walking to work and the only medication he takes is the occasional aspirin or Tylenol.

'If I don't get to work,' he said, 'bills don't get paid. As long as my two feet are good and my health is good, I don't think I'll change.'
