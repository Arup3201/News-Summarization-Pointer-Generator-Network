The BBC may have embarked on some of the most dramatic cost-cutting in its history, but it seems there is still some way to go.

There are almost 4,500 job titles in existence at the Corporation, it has emerged, and almost 2,000 of its staff have the word manager in their title.

It is thought there are even more staff on top of this who are classed as and paid as managers but do not have the word in their job titles.

The broadcaster, which has long been 
accused of having too many middle and senior managers, also employs 191 
staff with the word ‘adviser’ in the title.

Following
 a Freedom of Information request, the BBC has also admitted that 44 
members of staff have the word ‘strategy’ in their job role. Within its 
news department alone there are more than 1,000 job titles, another 700 
in its TV department and nearly 500 in radio.

licence fee on top of so many other bills, and expecting it to be spent 
on things like making programmes, will be worried that too much of their
 money is going on a bloated management structure’

There
 could be significantly more roles because the figures only refer to BBC
 staff on permanent and fixed-term contracts and do not include casual 
workers, or jobs at its commercial arm or BBC World News.

Yesterday
 critics said the figures showed the BBC was still wasting large amounts
 of money ‘on sustaining a massive bureaucracy’.

The
 area with the second highest number of job titles – 918 – was the 
Corporation’s operations group and executive support projects, which is 
not involved with programme making.

This part of the business is in charge of areas such as strategy, policy, distribution, property, legal affairs and looking after the organisation’s buildings.

As of October 7, 2011, there were 4,420 job titles at the Corporation with 1,894 staff having the word ‘manager’ in their job title.

A BBC spokesman defended the number of different roles, claiming that the title manager is ‘generally used to reflect a particular level of experience and seniority within the BBC rather than someone who actually manages a team of people’.

One BBC insider said: ‘Some of the titles you come across are just absurd and are beyond belief.

‘There always seems to be a lot of managers swilling around – I am not sure how busy they are.’

Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘This is fresh evidence to support longstanding concerns that the BBC is wasting huge amounts of money sustaining a massive bureaucracy.

‘Families struggling to pay their licence fee on top of so many other bills, and expecting it to be spent on things like making programmes, will be worried that too much of their money is going on a bloated management structure.’

The news comes after the BBC promised last year that it was banning baffling job titles and would make it clearer to the public what staff are doing.

Last month, BBC chief operating officer Caroline Thomson was asked on Newsnight why when the Corporation wanted to put money into programmes it was at the same time trying to recruit a ‘decision support analyst’ on £58,000 a year.

She admitted: ‘I don’t know what that person actually does but what I do say is that you want the BBC to be a well-managed organisation.’
