Dame Barbara Hakin allegedly halted a review into high mortality rates at the trust and threatened to sack Mr Walker

A health chief who threatened to sack a whistleblower is now under investigation for quashing a probe into high death rates at his hospital.

Dame Barbara Hakin, who is one of the most powerful women in the NHS, has been referred to the General Medical Council for allegedly ditching an inspection at United Lincolnshire NHS trust three years ago.

As many as 670 patients are feared to have died unnecessarily at the trust since 2009.

Concerned that the hospital’s ‘target culture’ was putting patients at risk, Gary Walker – who was then the trust’s chief executive and has since turned whistleblower – told Dame Barbara in 2009 he was planning to get an external review of mortality rates.

He was concerned that patients who weren’t seriously ill were being treated ahead of urgent cases, simply to allow the trust to meet targets.

But Dame Barbara, 55, who has been described as the ‘right-hand woman’ of NHS Chief Sir David Nicholson, is said to have halted the review and warned Mr Walker he ‘would have to go’.

She has also been accused of writing a letter to the hospital trust ordering it to meet its waiting list targets ‘whatever the demand’.

Mr Walker said Dame Barbara told him in a face to face the trust must hit targets despite it being full to breaking point. This, he claims, endangered patients because meeting the non-emergency targets would require him to turn away emergency patients or cut down on care.

In a handwritten note, Dame Barbara said to the chairman of the East Midlands Strategic Health Authority John Brigstocke: ‘Need to meet targets whatever demand.’

The Mail understands that the GMC is now investigating a number of claims that Dame Barbara’s actions put patients at risk.

The GMC will now decide whether Dame Barbara – a former Bradford GP who is a senior director on the NHS Commissioning Board on a salary of £70,000 a year – should be hauled in front of a disciplinary hearing.

This could lead to her being suspended or even struck off.

Although she no longer practises as a GP, the humiliation would be disastrous for her career as one of the most senior NHS executives.

The allegations, which date back to 2009 when Dame Barbara was head of the regional body in charge of United Lincolnshire NHS Trust, were made by Dr Phil Hammond and Andrew  Bousfield, a journalist, who handed the GMC a dossier of evidence.

A spokesman for the GMC said it would not comment on cases under investigation.

Dame Barbara lives in Oxenhope, West Yorkshire, with her husband, Dr Ronald Hakin, 75, a retired neurologist. She has two grown-up children.

Initially she was chief executive of Bradford Primary Care Trust and was then appointed head of the East Midlands Strategic Health Authority, which was in charge of United Lincolnshire hospitals.

In 2009 she was made a dame for her ‘services to healthcare’ and at the time said she was ‘very honoured’.

She is now the national managing director of commissioning development at the NHS Commissioning Board – the new body in charge of hospitals and GP services.

A spokesman for the strategic health authority said: ‘During her tenure as SHA chief executive, Dame Barbara acted at all times in the interest of patients, ensuring that they received high quality and safe services.’

Mr Walker said he had told Dame Barbara that he was going to order a mortality rate review at the hospital due to the high number of patients he was having to treat.

He said: ‘I emailed Dame Barbara to set the agenda for the meeting the following day and I said I wanted to order a mortality review.

‘When I met her, she didn’t want to speak about it. She was incensed by my email. Her words were: “You will have to go or your career will be in tatters”.’

He claimed: ‘If she had acted on my concerns, I believe fewer people would have died.’
