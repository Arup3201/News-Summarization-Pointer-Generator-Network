It's a chapter of Hugh Jackman's life not many people know about. 

The Hollywood star once said he only 'truly grew up' when he spent months working with in Australia's most remote Indigenous communities. 

Now he has added his voice to an effort to stop the West Australian government's effort to shut down as many as half of the state's 270 remote communities.

'This is my country': As many as a thousand people could be forced to move if the WA State Government plan goes ahead

In a message posted on social media, Jackman said: 'While living in a remote community I came to understand the 'connection' to land is a fundamental part of Indigenous identity, think about the past, have quality conversations. I SUPPORT YOU'. 

Indigenous leaders have been highly critical of the state government's plans, which could involve the forced removal of more than 1000 people. 

Many were angered by Prime Minister Tony Abbott's remarks that governments could not 'endlessly subsidise lifestyle choices'. 

Jackman reflected upon what he learned living on the land while 'nursing a broken heart' in an interview with Canada's George Stroumboulopoulos Tonight several years ago. 

'Day after day, week after week, there's a magical effect the landscape had, and that the Aboriginal people had,' he said. 

He told his father 'I think I'm going to live out here forever' but his father said he should finish college first and evaluate his options then. 

The X-Men star said he was inspired by the Indigenous people's sense of community and togetherness.

In an interview with a Canadian broadcaster years ago, Jackman said he was tempted to live in the outback with remote communities for a long time

He was angered by the media's constant focus on the problems in Indigenous communities, rather than the positives.

'It really was where I think I grew up. Who am I? What do I want to do? What do I want to say?' he said. 

Jackman, who was schooled at the prestigious Knox Grammar on Sydney's leafy north shore, said he had not even learned about the Stolen Generations. 

Blasting the PM's remarks on the issue last week, Indigenous leader Warren Mundine said living on the land was essential for the nation's first people.

'It's about their life, it's about their very essence, it's about their very culture'.
