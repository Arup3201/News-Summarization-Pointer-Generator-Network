Manchester United are refusing to give up in their attempts to prise Brazilian defender Marquinhos away from Paris Saint-Germain, despite the French club's reluctance to part with the player.

Marquinhos is a 20-year-old central defender who is among the most highly rated young talents in world football. He has enjoyed two impressive seasons for PSG since signing for the club in the summer of 2013 in a deal that is thought to have approached £30m when he was only 19 years of age.

United are believed to have made enquiries in the January transfer window but were knocked back in no uncertain terms by the Parisians.

PSG defender Marquinhos remains a target for Manchester United

United are looking to bolster their defence this summer. Nathaniel Clyne is a leading target at right back, while they will also seek to recruit two centre-halves of elite standing. Marquinhos is believed to be one of those being closely monitored by Louis van Gaal.

PSG view him as a long-term mainstay of their defence and the French club do not wish to sell the 20-year-old Brazilian but they are aware of growing and sustained interest from Old Trafford. PSG are also conscious that despite Marquinhos being Brazilian, he has a European passport, meaning that he does not take up a non-EU place in their squad. This only increases the player's value to the club as only four non-EU citizens are permitted in a squad in Ligue 1.

If United wish to bring PSG to the negotiating table, it will require an offer that usurps the £30m that they paid for Rio Ferdinand in 2002 and the £40m that Manchester City are reported to have shelled out for Eliaquim Mangala last summer. Even a British record fee for a defender, however, may not be enough to persuade PSG to sell, with the club so far resolute in their determination to brush off United's interest.

Marquinhos' agent has gone public in recent weeks to state that the defender is target for several of Europe's leading clubs, including United, but that could also be a ploy to force PSG into offering improved terms to the player. Reports in France suggest those talks are continuing with the French club.

Sources close to PSG have told Sportsmail that Marquinhos is happy to remain at the club, while many who work around the club have been impressed by his skill, attitude and dedication.

After only a few months at the club, Marquinhos was already conducting mixed zone interviews in French and he recently described PSG coach Laurent Blanc as 'the best coach a young defender could wish to have.'

However, PSG wish to strengthen significantly this summer and the demands of Financial Fair Play may force them to move players out in order to bring in recruitments. There is increasing speculation that Edinson Cavani and Ezequiel Lavezzi could be among the contenders but a David Luiz-style bid for Marquinhos could force the French club to think long and hard.

The extraordinary television rights deal in England has also not gone unnoticed by senior figures in France. While Premier League clubs will tap into a £5billion jackpot from 2016, the Ligue 1 rights deal is worth only £538m to French clubs per season, compared to the £1.7b that Premier League clubs will rake in from Sky Sports and BT.

It only strengthens the position of Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea in the transfer market while placing a squeeze on PSG, who also have to cope with higher tax demands in France. There is a growing fear that it could further fuel the competitive imbalance in the European transfer market.

Marquinhos, for his part, has played a significant role in the PSG backline this season but he has often been forced to deputise at right full-back, rather than in his favoured central defensive position.

Intriguingly, many regular observers of this PSG outfit discern that Marquinhos is already a more accomplished centre-back than David Luiz and Thiago Silva.
