Defence Secretary Philip Hammond faces a mutiny over plans to scrap the Army battalion named after Britain’s Waterloo hero, the Duke of Wellington.

Army sources say the Duke of Wellington's battalion of the Yorkshire Regiment is among those to be axed in a cost-cutting cull of the Forces.

The proposal, revealed on the eve of tomorrow’s 197th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, has prompted an angry protest by the present Duke of Wellington, who is the regiment’s Deputy Colonel-in-Chief.

The regiment's Colonel-in-Chief is Prince Andrew.

The Duke has written to the head of the Army, General Sir Peter Wall, urging him to save the historic name of the battalion.

The 96-year-old Duke, who won the Military Cross in the Second World War, told the Chief of the General Staff that abandoning the name of his ancestor, known as the 'Iron Duke' and one of Britain's most famous battlefield leaders, would be a grave mistake.

The Duke was backed last night by Major General Sir Evelyn Webb-Carter, chairman of Waterloo 200, a group set up to organise the 2015 commemoration of the 1815 battle that marked Napoleon’s final defeat.

The Major General told The Mail on Sunday: ‘I accept there may have to be cuts for financial reasons, but given the prominence of the name Wellington in the history of our nation and the Armed Forces, it would be extraordinary if it is not  to be preserved.

‘It would be especially contrary when we are approaching the 200th anniversary of Waterloo.

‘The brave soldiers in the Duke of Wellington’s battalion, who are  performing so magnificently in Afghanistan today, greatly value the link with the Iron Duke’s family.’

Senior officers were shocked to  be told at a regimental dinner in York last month that Army chiefs have decided that the historic name  will go.

In March, five men of the battalion, together with a sixth from another regiment, were killed by a Taliban bomb in the single worst enemy attack on UK troops in Afghanistan since operations began in 2001.

Earlier this month, Private Gregg Stone, 20, of 3rd Battalion, was killed during a successful raid to free an Afghan policeman taken hostage by the Taliban. His wife Samantha is pregnant with their first child.

The regiment dates back 300 years and fought under Wellington’s  command at Waterloo as the 33rd Regiment, reportedly prompting Napoleon to comment: ‘These English dogs of war never know when they are beaten.’

It was renamed The Duke of  Wellington’s Regiment by Queen Victoria in 1853, the year after the Duke died.

The regiment fought in the American War of Independence, India, the Boer War and in the First World War at the Somme.

In the Second World War it  campaigned in North Africa, Italy, France and Burma. It also took part in the 2003 Iraq War.

Nine of its soldiers have been awarded the Victoria Cross.

Affectionately known as the ‘Dukes’, the regiment was amalgamated with the Prince of Wales’s Own Regiment of Yorkshire and The Green Howards to form the Yorkshire Regiment in 2006.

It became 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment (Duke of Wellington’s).

The Mail on Sunday understands that the Yorkshire Regiment is to  be reduced to two battalions. The 

Ministry of Defence last night denied any final decision had been taken.

A total of 600 of the Yorkshire Regiment’s 1,800 soldiers are expected to lose their jobs, including some from the Duke of Wellington’s battalion.

The row follows Mr Hammond’s decision to reduce the strength  of the Armed Forces from 180,000 to 150,000 over five years as part  of £38 billion of defence savings.

The Army will be cut to 82,000 soldiers. Critics say it means it can no longer be classed as an army but rather a self-defence force, a term often applied to forces numbering fewer than 100,000.

An Army spokesperson said: ‘The Army is currently considering  redesign options. No decisions have been taken.

'The regimental system is fundamental to the fighting power of the British Army today and we are not going to change it.'
