In England there are fascinating landmarks and legends to be found around every corner, many of which were left by Roman settlers hundreds of years ago.

We round up some of the best places for a spot of time-travelling.

City of London

It has changed a little since Roman times, but everything from street bollards to the Roman ruins tucked underneath medieval landmarks is unique to this part of the city

With its own flag, crest and lord mayor, the square mile that makes up the City of London is distinctively different from the rest of the capital. 

Everything from the street bollards to the Roman ruins tucked underneath medieval landmarks is unique to this part of the city. 

Take the amphitheatre, for example – a 2,000-year-old ruin beneath the Guildhall. Wander around the ragstone remains brought to life by futuristic light displays, and learn all about the gory battles and public executions that took place here centuries ago. 

Then travel forwards in time, admiring pre-Raphaelite masterpieces by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Edward Poynter in the Guildhall Art Gallery.

York

York Minster is not only the largest Gothic cathedral in Northern Europe, but also famous for its colossal, ornately designed stained-glass windows

With York Minster looming over the narrow streets or ‘Snickelways’ lined with crooked Tudor buildings now housing boutiques, York is one of those cities that take you back centuries. 

The Minster deserves a second mention, not just because it is the largest Gothic cathedral in Northern Europe, but also for its colossal, ornately designed stained-glass windows. 

Get there early to bask in ruby-and emerald-hued sunlight and admire the heavenly limestone arches.

Hadrian’s Wall

Pull on your hiking boots and step aboard the AD 122 (named after the date the wall was first constructed) from outside Newcastle Central Station. 

Recreating a battle scene at Hadrian's Wall - you can catch the aptly-named AD 122 bus outside Newcastle Central Station to explore key sections of the wall between Newcastle and Carlisle

This bus allows you to hop on and off at key sections of the wall between Newcastle and Carlisle. 

We recommend starting your mini Roman ramble by stopping at Chesters Roman Fort, which takes just an hour to reach by bus. 

Here you’ll come across one of the wall’s largest and best preserved bath houses next to the North Tyne River. 

Sit in the hot plunge bath and even peep into the niches, or ‘lockers’. Don’t worry – you won’t find any Roman togas lurking!

Battle

This town in East Sussex was the scene of the battle that changed the course of English history for ever. Four years after his victory in 1066, William the Conqueror constructed Battle Abbey as a symbol of penance.

Battle Abbey was constructed by William the Conqueror in 1070 as a symbol of penance

Today, you can explore the dramatic ruins and the battlefield on an audio tour and stand on the exact spot where King Harold was famously shot in the eye. 

As much as we enjoy hearing tales of ancient bloodshed, there’s more to East Sussex than warfare. Nearby Hastings has a beautifully preserved Old Town (home to the biggest beach-launched fishing fleet in Britain) and the Jerwood Gallery, with its impressive collection of British art.

And if you’re looking for somewhere to stay, English Country Cottages offers a hand-picked collection of historic houses, including Blue Plaque buildings and period properties, all with the comforts of home.
