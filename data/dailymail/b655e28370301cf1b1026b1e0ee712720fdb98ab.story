Former Kings Cross stripper and police trainee Kim Hollingsworth, who was this week found guilty of animal neglect, says she is the victim of a vicious Facebook hate campaign that has forced her to go into hiding under an assumed name.

Ms Hollingsworth told Daily Mail Australia she has vengeful enemies who wrongly accused her of cruelty to animals.

On Wednesday, a magistrate ordered Ms Hollingsworth pay more than $100,000 in costs after convicting her of charges including starving horses on properties at Brownlow Hill and Mulgoa, west of Sydney, late last year.

Former policewoman and Kings Cross stripper Kim Hollingsworth has been ordered to pay more than $100,000 in vet costs after she was convicted of starving her horses

Ms Hollingsworth was dismissed as a NSW Police trainee in 1995 after failing to reveal her past as a stripper in Sydney's notorious Kings Cross

The one-time police trainee, whose earlier short careers as a Kings Cross stripper  were portrayed in the television series Underbelly: The Golden Mile, maintained she had done nothing wrong and would appeal against the convictions.

She says she is the victim of a Facebook-led hate campaign which at one stage had more than 3000 followers and which has caused her to fear for her life. 'I'm now hiding under an assumed name somewhere in Sydney,' she said. 

Ms Hollingsworth said she had never been cruel to animals and pictures showing emaciated horses in her care did not prove she had neglected animals. 

'Any horse I save comes in looking like s....,' she said. 

The 48-year-old faced 14 charges of animal neglect against four horses at properties at Brownlow Hill and Mulgoa in Sydney in late 2013

Ms Hollingsworth, who was portrayed in the popular television series Underbelly: The Golden Mile, was forced to surrender five horses to the RSPCA

The 48-year-old said one of the horses she was convicted of failing to properly feed, a bay gelding called Ghrib, was 29 years old, was missing teeth, and 'came to me in the most emaciated condition I'd ever seen in my life'. 

Ms Hollingsworth was forced to surrender five horses to the RSPCA and ordered to pay $67,609 for vet costs and $46,768 for professional costs at Penrith Local Court.

The charges included failing to provide proper and sufficient food and failure to provide veterinary treatment to four horses in three separate matters. Ms Hollingsworth pleaded not guilty.

'In one month I had the vet out to six different horses,' she said. 'So it's not like I was trying to avoid vet bills.' 

RSPCA inspectors responded to a complaint regarding horses at a Brownlow Hill property, in Sydney's south-west, in August 2013.

They found a grey pony mare in an emaciated body condition and Ms Hollingsworth was issued with written directions to have the horse seen to by a veterinarian.

That pony, Sadie, was aged about 35, Ms Hollingsworth said, and she had been looking after her for six to eight weeks. Sadie had an undetected eye condition and no teeth. 'She would just stand there and not eat,' she said.

'Obviously (the short time) in my hands it was not enough for her to gain significant weight.'

 'I did my best with her. As far as I was concerned, I was following the vet's instructions.'

A month later, she was issued further directions to provide veterinary treatment and proper and sufficient food to Sadie and Ghrib.

However, Ms Hollingsworth said Ghrib was missing teeth, had been 'very problematic' and fluctuated widely in weight. 'There's a million reasons why a horse doesn't gain weight,' she said. 

On October 31, the RSPCA were called again to the property where they claimed Sadie was in need of urgent treatment. Sadie and Ghrib were taken into care after being found to have dental issues. Sadie is the horse Ms Hollingsworth said has no teeth.

On November 5, the RSPCA was called to a Mulgoa property, near Penrith in Sydney's west, in a separate matter after concerns were raised over the emaciated condition of a brumby mare.

The animal was seized and was found to have lice and worms. Ms Hollingsworth said that horse had been resistant to worming and lice treatment had not worked. At the time, bushfires in the area had sometimes prevented her from visiting the animals every day.

'I drove through flames to get to those horses,' she said. 

Later in November, RSPCA inspectors were called to the Mulgoa property again to look at a chestnut brumby mare and foal.

'I paid the vet to come and see her and followed his expert advice to just keep feeding her,' Ms Hollingsworth said. 'She was actually over fed.'

The mare was in an emaciated condition, the court heard.

Both horses were seized and a vet determined the mare was suffering from lice and worms. Ms Hollingsworth said: 'Lice can be very hard to get rid of. Horses can reinfect each other.' 

Ms Hollingsworth said it was difficult to maintain weight on brumbies. 'Brumbies have this way of just plummeting very quickly,' she said.   

This is the second time Ms Hollingsworth has been convicted of offences under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act for similar charges. She has also beaten another set of charges, will appeal against this week's decision and has one more set of charges to defend in court next month.

'Every case I lose will go to the Supreme Court because I've got nothing to lose,' she said. 'It's not the money. It's all about the horses' lives. They would all be dead if it were not for me.'  

Ms Hollingsworth told Daily Mail Australia she had been the subject of a Facebook hate campaign.

Two of the women she alleges to be campaigning against her have taken out apprehended violence orders against Ms Hollingsworth. She, in turn, is applying for orders against them. 

'They're just jealous,' she said. 'I was saving horse after horse. I've never said no to a horse in my life. I think I just got too big for my boots in their eyes. I was saving too many horses.'  

Horses in Ms Hillingsworth's care were also found to have lice and worms on various occassions

Penrith Local Court awarded custody of the horses to the RSPCA this week

This is the second time Ms Hollingsworth has been convicted of offences under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act for similar charges

Ms Hollingsworth was dismissed as a NSW Police trainee in 1995 after failing to reveal her past as a prostitute and stripper in Sydney's notorious Kings Cross.

Her story became part of the TV series based on John Ibrahim in Underbelly: The Golden Mile. 

She was recruited as an undercover detective to act as an informant for the Wood royal commission into police corruption in the lates 1980s and early 1990s. Those experiences led her to being diagnosed with post traumatic stress syndrome.

Ms Hollingsworth said it was only due to what she had been through during those years that she had not thrown herself under a train.

'This has traumatised me more than the police force thing,' she said.
