A woman was scarred for life after she was viciously attacked by two collies when she went to the aid of what she thought was an injured dog in the road.

Catherine Buckley had a huge chunk bitten out of her right forearm after she was set upon by the two dogs in Scammonden, West Yorkshire.

The 33-year-old had got out of her car on a country lane to usher one of the dogs from the middle of the road believing it to have been injured.

But the dog, along with its companion turned on her, with one biting her arm and the other clamping its jaws around her thumb.

Ms
 Buckley, who heard other dogs barking and saw six more in a nearby 
field, has had to undergo skin grafts and faces the prospect of further 
cosmetic surgery following the attack.

She said: 'It was terrifying. If the dogs had managed to drag me into the field I don't think I'd still be here.

'As I went to the dog, it jumped over a fence and into the field. The next thing I know, two dogs had jumped back over the fence and went for me.

'I was absolutely petrified.

'The dog who had my right forearm only let go once it had sunk its teeth all the way into my arm. I then took a swing for the other dog on my left hand to get it off of me.'

One
 of the dogs released its grip on her arm and she managed to fight off 
the second dog before going back to her car with blood dripping from her
 wounds.

She claims the dogs
 were housed in kennels which were not properly fenced off and police 
are investigating it as a criminal matter.

Painful: Ms Buckley also had to have five stitches in her thumb and hand

Ms
 Buckley, who described the dogs as border collie cross breeds, was 
taken by ambulance to Huddersfield Royal Infirmary for treatment.

She was sent to Bradford Royal Infirmary the following day and was admitted overnight.

She had skin grafted from her thigh to her right arm and a pot was fitted to help the healing process.

Ms Buckley also needed five stitches to her left hand.

Catherine, of Bailiff Bridge, West Yorkshire, was prescribed a course of antibiotics and painkillers and is still off work because of her injuries.

'The dogs could get out again and people ride bikes around there. I dread to think what would have happened if a child had been attacked.'

She said: 'They could easily have gone for my face or throat.'

'The dogs could get out again and people ride bikes around there.

'I dread to think what would have happened if a child had been attacked.'

The owner of the dogs has been spoken to by police and Catherine has since returned to the scene to identify the dogs involved.

She said: 'I've not had an apology yet and I was too scared to speak to the owner when I travelled back to the farmhouse with the police.

'He was co-operating with police but I don't think he realised how severe my injuries were.'

Catherine has been told she will be permanently scarred and doctors will consider more cosmetic surgery in 12 months’ time.

A spokesman for West Yorkshire Police confirmed that the matter is currently under investigation.

He said: 'The victim sustained a hand injury which required hospital treatment and police have been investigating the incident which is being treated as a criminal matter.

'Police have now interviewed the owner of the dogs and arrangements have been put in place for the victim to identify the animals involved.

Scene: Ms Buckley stopped on this road after seeing what she thought was an injured dog

'Guidance was given to the owner in the interim to keep the dogs secure on his land.'

The investigation comes just a week after ministers proposed tougher new laws which could see owners of killer dogs jailed for life.

The proposals, which the Government has put out to public consultation, would see dog owners jailed for a maximum of 10 years if their pet injures someone with the same penalty potentially incurred if it kills a guide dog.

Under current laws, dog owners can only go to jail for up to two years.

The proposals were outlined just months after 14-year-old Jade Anderson was killed by four dogs when visiting a friend  near Wigan, Greater Manchester.

On average there are 210,000 dog attacks in the UK each year with 6,000 of those resulting in hospital treatment for the victim.

Since 2005, 16 people have been mauled to death in dog attacks in the UK.
