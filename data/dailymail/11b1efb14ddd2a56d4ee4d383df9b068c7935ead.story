Four boys on a school trip have unearthed a 4,300-year-old hair tress which is being described as one of the most significant recent archaeological finds in the UK.

The boys, Joseph Bell, Luca Alderson, Sebastian Alderson and Aidan Bell, were on a local dig in Kirkhaugh, Northumberland, when they saw a glint of gold in the soil.

To their astonishment it turned out to be an ancient hair tress and one of the earliest ever pieces of metal work to have been found in the UK.

The schoolchildren, aged between seven and ten, had been on a dig arranged by the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) Partnership's Altogether Archaeology project, when they stumbled across the treasure.

The ornament may have been worn by a first-generation metal worker who could have travelled to Britain from overseas in search of gold and copper.

The tresses are very rare and only ten finds have ever been made in Britain

Seven-year-old Joseph said: 'We were digging carefully in the ground and I saw something shiny, it was gold.

'Me and Luca started dancing with joy. It was very exciting.'

The intricately decorated tress dates back to about 2,300 BC, a period known as the Copper Age, which is pre-Bronze Age

His friend, eight-year-old Luca added: 'When I first saw it I felt happy but I thought it was plastic. When I found out it was gold, I was very happy.'

The intricately decorated tress, which dates back to about 2,300 BC, a period known as the Copper Age, which is pre-Bronze Age, was found in a burial mound alongside three beautiful flint arrowheads and a jet button.

The boys went along to the dig, which took place at Randalholme Farm at Kirkhaugh, after taking part in an Altogether Archaeology project called Dreaming the Land, while at Alston Primary in Cumbria.

During the project, the boys learned about local archaeology, which inspired them to attend the community dig.

Sebastian, ten, said: 'We did some work on the Copper Age at school which was really interesting.

'But to take part in the actual excavation, and to find things, was awesome.'

Aidan, also 10, added: 'We went to see the site before it had been dug up with our class. I can't wait to go back to school to tell everyone because they will never believe what we found.'

The head tress, along with arrowheads andÂ  button, will now be analysed by specialists.

Paul Frodsham, who leads the Altogether Archaeology project said: 'All archaeological sites are important in their own way, but this is exceptional.

'It can be regarded as marking the very start of mineral exploitation in the North Pennines, leading in due course to Roman exploitation of lead and silver, and eventually to the vast post-medieval lead industry for which the region is internationally famous.'
