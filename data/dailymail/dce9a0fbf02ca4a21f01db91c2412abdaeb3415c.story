A clerical error has been blamed for the demolition of a historic building in downtown St Louis made famous by an iconic mural of a hippie.

The 1890 structure that at one time housed a saloon stood in a protected district, and the garage door's fresco of a hippie named Beardy McGreen flashing a peace sign, had been something of a local attraction since 2006.

The building was razed in December without the required city review because a city employee incorrectly entered its address, putting the structure outside the historical district where all demolition applications are subject to review.  

Razed to the ground: This historic 19th century building in downtown St Louis featuring the beloved caricature of Beardy McGreen was demolished in December due to a clerical error

Doomed: The long-vacant structure that once housed a saloon and a butcher shop was destroyed without the required review because a city employee incorrectly entered its address into a database

As the edifice was being knocked down by a work crew, Beardy's image was torn from the building and cast off in a pile of bricks – but the mural was later salvaged and re-purposed, according to St Louis Dispatch. 

The massive peacenik caricature measuring 12 feet x 13.5 feet was created and named in November 2006 by local stencil artist Peat Wollaeger as developers sought to boost the rundown Chouteau's Landing district. 

The 19th century building at 818 South 4th Street originally was home to Max Risch Saloon and the John Gass Butcher Shop.

It was part of the South Fourth Street Commercial District, which had been placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.

The designation requires all demolition permits to be reviewed by the city Cultural Resources Office.

On the inside: These images show the interior of the old building, which had been stripped down to the studs but still appeared relatively sound, save for some shaky floorboards

Rescued: The dented garage door bearing the likeness of the beloved hippie was salvaged by local businessman Scott Rinaberger

‘A manual data entry transfer between two databases was made incorrectly, causing the permit application to appear to be for a structure not entitled to review,’ said Don Roe, the city's director of Planning and Urban Design.

Roe said he has since altered the process to ensure against errors in the future.

‘I just think it's crazy how each one of these buildings in St. Louis is going away,’ Wollaeger said. "I thought the (mural) was going to spark something in that neighborhood.’

Property owner Terrence C. McDonald said the interior of the long-vacant building, which had been stripped down to the studs some years ago, was hollow, damp and beyond repair.

However, the conservation blog Vanishing STL shared photos in December showing the inside of the historic structure looking relatively sound, save for a few spots where the floorboards were deteriorating.

McDonald now plans to turn the property into a parking lot.

Scott Rinaberger heard about the demolition and wanted the mural for his new School of Rock music education site in Kirkwood. He drove to the site and saw the empty space where the iconic former saloon once stood.

‘You killed Beardy,’ Rinaberger remembered saying.

But luck was on his side that day: he saw a pile of rubble, and in it was Beardy McGreen still flashing his peace sign.

‘We were able to salvage most of him,’ Rinaberger said. The hippie now takes up most of a wall in the school's main performance studio.

On December 23, Rinaberger posted an update on the School of Rock's Facebook page: 'Beardy McGreen is resting comfortably. He is in for a lot of pounding and bending but should pull through.’
