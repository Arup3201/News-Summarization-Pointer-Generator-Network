Dozens of Hawaiians have been told to prepare for evacuations as lava flow approaches homes in their sleepy town on Big Island.

Officials from Hawaii County Civil Defense say that the leading edge of molten lava is now within about 70 yards of the nearest home in Pahoa Village, and could threaten up to 4,000 residents.

The Red Cross has opened a facility in the town, one of the largest in the rural Puna district, to house evacuees fleeing the 2,000-degree molten rock, and a smoke advisory was issued for those downwind of the flow.

Red alert: Dozens of residents in the flow path have been told to complete all necessary preparations by Tuesday for a possible evacuation

Matt Purvis, owner of Tin Shack Bakery in downtown, told CNN that looters were taking the opportunity to steal from abandoned homes.

'Crime is starting to pick up because a lot of people abandoned their houses. Two of my brother-in-laws' houses got ripped off,' Purvis said. 

The Kilauea volcano has erupted continuously since 1983, but the lava often flows south towards an uninhabited part of the island where it reaches the water.

Since June, a flow heading northeast has advanced on Pahoa, and over the past few days was moving at a speed of about 10 to 15 yards an hour, though it slowed to about 2 yards an hour by late Monday.

Lava crossed Apaa Street on Sunday as it flowed over a Buddhist cemetery on the edge of the town on its way towards several homes, and officials say it could change direction at any time.

Resident Imelda Raras, who lives down the road, said her family is ready to head to another home in the Puna district if she gets the order to leave.

'We are still praying,' she said. 'I hope our home will be spared.'

Raras said that she and her husband put their belongings in storage back in September, and anything that couldn't be moved was photographed for insurance purposes.

Destruction: The growing stream of lava - at a temperature of around 2,000 degrees - has destroyed vegetation and is now threatening homes

Another resident moved out of her home and into her boyfriend's as lava began to threaten her home and said that curious onlookers and road closures had caused traffic jams.

'It's affecting us in every aspect of our lives,' said Warren, an employee at a local surf shop. 'There's just no escaping it.'

As the lava rolls in towards the town, it has rapidly heated and decomposed vegetation underneath, creating buildups of methane gas.

According to Janet Babb, a spokeswoman for the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, the gas is then ignited, triggering blasts. 

'It's not a massive explosion,' she said. 'But it can dislodge rocks. It can hurl large rocks several feet.'

If the lava continues flowing northeast, there are fears that it will cut off Pahoa Road, a main artery in the small town.

Smoking: Frequent methane explosions occur, resulting from cooked vegetation releasing methane which then ignites

Additional danger: The explosions caused by trapped methane gas can range from small puffs to loud cannon-like blasts

Alternative roads have been cut to provide evacuation routes should the lava flow cross the main road.

Emergency workers have also encased the bases of power line poles along the path of the volcano in concrete to insulate them from the intense heat. 

One fear is that the lava flow could reach Highway 130, on the other side of downtown from the volcano. If lava cuts off the bypass there, around 8,000 residents would become 'lava-locked' in Puna. 

Darryl Oliveira, director of Hawaii County Civil Defense, estimated there around 50 to 60 structures could be impacted, including homes and businesses.

He said Monday that the couple occupying the house closest to the lava flow had already left, returning occasionally to move out belongings.

'They are out of the property and awaiting the events to unfold,' Oliveira said.

Homeowners are aware of the risks and are required to buy insurance that covers damage caused by volcanic eruptions, as most of the homes in Puna are located on Kilauea itself.

Land in Puna is cheaper than more developed parts of the island chain, such as Honolulu on the island of Oahu.

There were around 200 homes destroyed by lava flows in the 1990s, while one home was destroyed in 2011 during the last period of evacuations.
