Fish and chip shops have been told to check their stock for shark meat after the gruesome discovery of scores of carcasses on the Isle of Wight.

A resident of the island was left horrified after stumbling across a mound of severed heads and fins of  smooth-hound sharks, which are completely harmless to humans.

After a picture of his shocking find appeared on Facebook, government officials have urged chip shops to ensure they know what they are selling.

Conservationists have called for catch limits on the amount of small-hound sharks that can be landed 

Shark meat is often used in pet food and fish meal but can also be passed off as huss or rock salmon, which are sold in takeaways around Britain.

It is thought an unlicensed trawler may have landed the sharks, before their valueless heads and fins were cut off, leaving only the meat.

Kevin Parker, who found the remains of what he estimates at more than 50 of the animals, said local residents had been shocked by what had been found.

He told MailOnline: 'I'm a fisherman myself but everyone I know throws them back alive when they catch them because they are of no real value and are falling in numbers. I think it must have been someone doing it illegally.

Smooth-hound sharks are found throughout the eastern Atlantic Ocean. While they can grow to 200cm in size, they are usually around 150cm long.

Despite being related to more ferocious creatures, smooth-hounds rarely even attack other fish and live off crabs and shellfish found on the sea-bed.

Rather than the typical razor-sharp teeth associated with their relations, the smooth-hound has much blunter crushing plates which are adapted to help them eat the crustaceans which make up the majority of their diet.

Smooth-hound are generally caught on a strict 'catch-and-release' basis by British anglers and killing one, according to one fishing website, is 'simply not the done thing'. 

After being classed as 'vulnerable', the common smooth-hound's plight has recently been compared to the polar bear by marine biologists.

'I was disgusted to see them all just discarded like that and everyone around here is really angry about it. It was especially sad to see that many of those killed were just young pups. How are they supposed to breed if even the young ones are being killed?'

The Food Standards Agency, which monitors the quality of food in restaurants and shops, has since issued guidance to anyone selling fish.

A spokesman said: 'Fish must be what it claims to be on the label or the menu and food businesses must make sure they buy their fish from reputable sources.'

Conservationists are also concerned because the smooth-hound species has been classified as 'vulnerable' by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.

Richard Peirce, chairman of the Shark Trust, warned that fishing for sharks is becoming increasingly common in British waters.

After viewing a photo of the latest find, he said: 'I'm always disappointed at the waste of vulnerable or endangered species.'

He called for limits on how many sharks fisherman can land in a bid to stop the rising numbers being caught.

Holidaymakers find dozens of dead sharks washed up on British beach after being scooped up by trawler then dumped

Marine experts have been left outraged after 70 dead sharks were found washed up on a British beach.

The 'perfectly healthy' sharks are thought to have been scooped up by a trawler then illegally dumped over the side.

The dead smooth-hounds and catsharks were found by holidaymakers on a remote beach on the Gower coastline of South Wales.

Marine biologist Judith Oakley blamed 'indiscriminate bottom trawling' for the grim find.

She said: 'It was horrific - I wandered along the beach in total disbelief. There were several varieties of small shark lying dead on the sand and over the rocks.

'I counted 55 but there were a lot more - I have never seen such a terrible sight here in Britain. There are always grim reminders of why I am so passionate about marine wildlife and protecting it.'

Mrs Oakley believes the sharks are victims of industrial scale bottom trawling - where boats use a large net with heavy weights to drag the seafloor and scoop up everything in its path.

She thinks the sharks were caught in the nets but then dumped back into the sea because they have no commercial value.

The dead sharks were found at Pwll Du Bay near Swansea but it is feared hundreds more may have been washed up on nearby rocks and inaccessible beaches.
