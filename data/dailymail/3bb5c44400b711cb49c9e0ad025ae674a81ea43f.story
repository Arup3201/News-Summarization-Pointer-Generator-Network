An illegal file-sharer has been fined a record $1.5million for pirating ten gay porn films online.

Kywan Fisher must pay damages of $150,000 per film to adult entertainment company Flava Works, a federal court in Illinois ruled this week.

The fine is thought to be the largest ever awarded in a file-sharing case, in part because Mr Fisher failed to show up in court or offer a defence.

He shared each film online for others to download using BitTorrent, Flava told the hearing.

The leaks were traced back to his computer using an individual encryption code inserted in the DVDs he originally bought as pay-per-view items directly from Flava.

After Mr Fisher shared the films, they were downloaded or viewed 3,449 times.

He was found to have violated the terms of Flava's pay-per-view service and then displayed 'wilful copyright infringement' by sharing the films.

Mr Fisher was one of 15 people that Flava took legal action against for pirating its movies, reports the BBC.

However, his case was the only one to reach court after the others were dropped for lack of evidence.

It is unclear whether he will appeal the ruling or can afford to pay the fine.

A study published in September found that people who use file-sharing programs to download films and music from the Internet are likely to have had their computer's virtual address logged.

Computer scientists at the University of Birmingham monitored what is perhaps the largest file sharing site, The Pirate Bay, over the last three years.

The team discovered that the most popular files on the site, often illegal copies of hit TV shows or films, were monitored by, on average, three secretive parties - including copyright enforcement agencies, security companies and even government research labs.

The monitors are believed to be logging the IP address of the user - potentially identifying where the file is downloaded to.

However, for anyone now worried about a knock at the door, the researchers say it is unlikely the evidence gathered would be sufficient to lead to court proceedings.

When a user chooses to download a file, the users join a 'swarm' of other users who are either downloading the file, of have successfully received it.

But by downloading a file, the user's IP address is available to other members of the swarm, and the Birmingham University team found monitors actively grabbing this information.
