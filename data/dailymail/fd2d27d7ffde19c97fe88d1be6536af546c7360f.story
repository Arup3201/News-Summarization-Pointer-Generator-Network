A former police chief from Pennsylvania who pleaded no contest to hindering a prosecution by having sex with the alleged victim may not learn his sentence for another seven years because of an unusual plea deal that was set in motion on Monday.

Scott Township Police Chief James Romano's sentencing is now on hold because he is fighting to keep his pension and, if he is denied, will be able to withdraw his guilty plea, according to The Scranton Times-Tribune.

Romano was arrested last year for allegedly having sex with a witness who was set to testify against a teacher accused of sleeping with a student.

Romano pleaded no contest to one count of hindering prosecution, a misdemeanor, and also agreed to resign, ending his career as a police officer.

James 'Jim' Romano may not start serving his sentence for hindering prosecution until 2021 after making a play for his pension. Romano, pictured here with his daughter, is believed to be divorced

However, he still wants to claim his pension.

Romano will not be told whether he will get his pension from the state his 50th birthday, which is seven years from now.

Since entering his plea, two judges have agreed to hold off sentencing until the pension situation is clear.

Lackawanna County President Judge Thomas 
Munley agreed on Monday to hold off on sentencing Romano until attorneys know for 
sure that he will receive his state pension after his 50th birthday.

Romano's case therefore remains open and he remains on bail.

He will either be able to keep his pension or he can withdraw his no contest plea.

'We have not hidden the fact that (the pension) has been the primary issue.,' said Romano’s attorney Frank Ruggiero.

'We wanted to preserve that pension for him because he had significant time as a law enforcement officer up to that point, the point that he was charged.

'It's unique, I think it's unique but I think this case is unique because of Romano's facts and, of course, the pension.'

James Romano, who was accused of having a sexual relationship with a witness in a case he was investigating in 2013, pleaded no contest in November to a charge of hindering prosecution

Romano first pleaded no contest in November to a charge of hindering prosecution.

The same month, special presiding Judge Harold Kane accepted an agreement that allowed Mr. Romano to withdraw his plea if he does not receive his pension, The Time-Tribune reported.

Monday marked the fifth meeting to determine if and when Mr. Romano would be sentenced, Mr. Ruggiero said.

During those meetings, Mr. Ruggiero and several lawyers from the attorney general's office debated whether that agreement had been reached. 

Both sides agreed that allowing Mr. Romano the option to withdraw his guilty plea if there is a problem with his pension years later is unprecedented.
