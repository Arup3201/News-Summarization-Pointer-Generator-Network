Barcelona hope to formally announce the signing of Luis Suarez on Thursday once Alexis Sanchez is confirmed as an Arsenal player.

The signing could be delayed until Friday, however, as they await further clarification over his four-month ban from FIFA.

Suarez has been suspended from all football activity for four months by FIFA after he bit defender Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay's World Cup group stage match with Italy.

But with Arsene Wenger confident of concluding a £30million deal for Barcelona forward Sanchez imminently, then Suarez's £75m move to Catalonia could also be completed.

Chile star Sanchez has opted for the Gunners ahead of Liverpool and Juventus and his representatives are in London to agree personal terms and conclude the deal.

Sanchez is set to be offered a similar package to top-earner Mesut Ozil, who is paid £140,000 a week. Arsenal will meet Barcelona’s £30m valuation, allowing the Spanish side to complete a deal for Suarez.

An £11m move for Newcastle defender Mathieu Debuchy is almost complete and an £8m swoop for QPR striker Loic Remy is held up only by his personal terms.

Sportsmail understands Remy, who earns £75,000 a week at Loftus Road, and Arsenal are still some distance apart on terms but Debuchy is on the brink of completing his protracted switch to the Emirates after having a medical on Monday.

He will replace Bacary Sagna, who has joined Manchester City, as the club’s first-choice right back.
