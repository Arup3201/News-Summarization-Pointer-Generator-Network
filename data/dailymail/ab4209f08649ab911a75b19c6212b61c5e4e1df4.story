Six South Australian police officers were arrested this morning over alleged offences including stealing liquor and tools and abuse of public office. 

The plain-clothed officers, who worked in Sturt, south of Adelaide, were part of a unit of just seven people tasked with taking on street crime and low level drug dealers.  

SA Police Commissioner Gary Burns said a 'subculture' had developed in the Operation Mantle unit.

Six SA police officers were arrested and will face charges including abuse of public office

Mr Burns said theft had included 'anything from liquor, to alcohol, to tools' as well as electronic devices. 

Today's arrests followed a joint investigation by the state's Independent Commissioner Against Corruption and the corruption-busting branch of the SA Police.

Mr Burns told reporters the investigations began after police picked up on 'irregularities' in the team earlier this year.  

All of the officers have been suspended and will be charged over abuse of public office and property related offences.
