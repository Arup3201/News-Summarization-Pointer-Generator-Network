Lollipop man, Barry Brannick, 68, with the camera fitted to his body

Lollipop men patrolling Britain’s 'most dangerous school crossing' are being fitted with cameras - after being knocked down by hit-and-run drivers a total of five times.

The cameras were fitted to traffic monitors working outside Monks Abbey Primary School, Lincoln, this morning.

The security measures have been introduced after lollipop man Dave Ellis, 41, was ran over three times, while his colleague Barry Brannick, 64, was hit twice in the last five months.

The pair have also had to dive out of the way of several speeding cars after drivers refused to stop when they displayed their stop sign.

Dave - who says he receives daily 
abuse from angry motorists - hopes the cameras can help reduce the number of 
reckless drivers who regularly speed through the two crossings.

The
 shocking number of accidents has led the road outside the 330-pupil 
school being branded 'Britain’s most dangerous school crossing'.

Video footage of crashes or near misses will be used in court to prosecute dangerous drivers.

Dave, from Lincoln, started wearing the chest-mounted camera today.

He said: 'It’s going to be a positive step - it’s going to make children’s lives safer and its going to make our jobs easier.

'Hopefully it will deter people from driving through and speeding but I don’t actually see them stopping accidents.'

There are two crossings near the school where Dave, who mans one of the crossings, was first hit by a car in May.

One
 car hit him with such force his hand was shattered in two places, and 
the lollipop was ripped from his hand and flung into a tree by a driver 
who failed to stop.

In September, Dave was hit from behind by another driver, who failed to stop while he helped pupils cross the road.

His
 co-worker Barry added: 'The first time I got hit was when I went after a
 child in the middle of the road - it damaged my leg and I was off work 
for two weeks.'

Signs have also been put up to warn drivers about the recording equipment.

John Siddle, from Lincolnshire Road Safety Partnership, said: 'We are trialling these cameras to combat lollipop rage.

'We are doing this for the protection of the children and the school crossing patrols, in an area that can be very dangerous.

'We want to make sure that we prevent a child getting hurt in future.'

Dangerous: Monks Abbey Primary School is close to a busy road, where drivers regularly break the speed limit

Siddle added: 'We are hoping the measures we are taking in using the video equipment will never have to be used in court.

'However, we are fully prepared that, should any driver endanger either the school crossing patrols or children, we will take all measures necessary to place that person before the courts.

'We have never known a school patrolling crossing like this one. It has to be the worst.

'The level of abuse David Ellis is receiving is terrible and drivers are simply not sticking to the rules.

'We appreciate that people are busy and in a hurry to get to places but the driving of some people in this residential area is crazy.'
