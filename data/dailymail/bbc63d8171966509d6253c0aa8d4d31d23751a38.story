Her commitment to her son's career is legendary.

She gave him his first 
tennis racket when he was two and coached him until he was 11. She even sacrificed her marriage to follow him around the world.

So after watching her son in an epic display of resilience, 
perseverance and sheer guts to become the first British man to 
win Wimbledon since 1936, it was no surprise that Judy Murray wanted to celebrate in style.

And the 53 year old, who has often been criticised for being one of the toughest women in tennis, couldn't hide her happiness as she dazzled watching her son Andy collect the Gentlemen's Singles Trophy during the Winner's Ball last night.

Dazzling: Judy Murray showed off her glamorous side in a glittering Jenny Packham gown during the Winner's Ball last night

While we are more accustomed to seeing her dressed head-to-toe in sports attire cheering her son on courtside, Judy showed off her more glamorous and feminine side at the InterContinental Park Lane Hotel last night.

Dressed in a £1680 floor-length glittering nude and blue haze gown by British designer Jenny Packham - a favourite of the Duchess of Cambridge - Judy Murray dazzled as she celebrated with her son.

Speaking to BBC Scotland ahead of the event, she said: 'I've just been selecting my dress for the champions' ball and I've never worn a long dress in my life before,

'But I will be tonight, with great pride.'

Glowing: Andy's 53-year-old mother was practically glowing with pride as she celebrated her son's long-awaited victory

New look: Judy said that she had never worn a long dress in her life before but had selected this dazzling number because it was a very special occasion

Despite the emotional turmoil of the day, Judy practically glowed she she joined Andy and girlfriend Kim Sears at the glamorous event.

Judy is often criticised as being tough and cold, but her son's long-awaited victory brought out a different side to his usually stony-faced mother.

As Andy Murray sank to his knees in shock at his victory against Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon yesterday, the cameras cut to Judy and we witnessed her give way to the emotion of the moment as she turned her back and burst into tears.

Proud: She is his number one fan and has followed him around the world in his tennis career so it is no wonder that Judy couldn't hide her smile last night as she posed with son Andy

He nearly committed an equally historic 
faux-pas at the moment of triumph, having clambered up into the stands 
to embrace his coach, physio, dietician, fitness guru, girlfriend, best 
friend, father and a few chums along the way.

On his way down again, he 
remembered that there was someone else seated just behind the players’ 
box.

To arguably the loudest cheers of the entire day, he returned to hug his mum.

Pure happiness: Judy couldn't hide her happiness after such a tense day watching her son

Home time: Judy looked tired after such along day celebrating her son's win. She has watched every single one of his matches and even sacrificed her marriage to follow him around the world

Judy has served as his greatest support system throughout his tennis career.

She famously loves mothering Andy, once even rushing out to buy thermometers to check his bathwater was 
exactly 37 degrees, as prescribed by his physio.

Once,
 when he didn't have the right shoes for a big match in Miami, she flew 
out from Britain with a new pair. 'What else could I do?' she said.

Sadly, her commitment took its toll on her relationship with husband Willie - the pair split when Andy was just nine.

At
 the time, she said: 'I was away a lot and then you're coaching until 
quite late in the evening. Your domestic life gets hit for six.'

Relief: Judy shows her emotion as Andy ends 77 years of waiting for a British champion and kisses the Wimbledon men's trophy yesterday after defeating world No 1 Novak Djokovic in straight sets

In June 2005, during Andy's 
Wimbledon debut, she was nicknamed 'Spy Mum' after using a video camera 
to film Andy's opponent George Bastl for him to analyse.

As well as supporting Andy from the 
stands as he became the first British champion since Fred Perry 
in 1936, Judy even spent time with her son at his home in Surrey 
during the tournament.

Speaking ahead of the big day, she said: 'The grass court season is the time when he can actually stay at home.

'He lives about half an hour away from Wimbledon - so he has that luxury of being able to stay at home.

Support: Andy Murray's mother Judy has been there all the way for her son. Here she 
arrived at day one of Wimbledon Tennis Championships 2013 to support her
 son

By his side: Judy spent time with her son at his home in Surrey during the tournament

'It is nice to be able to spend a bit of family time and be hi his own surroundings with his girlfriend and his dogs.'

Judy says Andy's skills originate from the homemade games she played with her sons when they were growing up.

She explained: 'They're all games we made up when Jamie and Andy were small.

'I had two boisterous young boys at home
 and not much money, so we were always challenging ourselves to find 
things that we could do when the weather's bad, often it was things we 
could do inside, without spending a lot of money.

'Biscuit tin lid cereal boxes, for example. We played that with cereal boxes for the net, biscuit lids for bats and a ping pong ball.

His girls: Judy, who watches her sons every match and says it doesn't get any easier, is close with his girlfriend Kim Sears (pictured here in 2010 and 2009 with Kim)

Support system: Judy is her son's number one fan and has supported him since day one. Here, she is pictured at his first ever Wimbledon tennis championships in June 2005

'It's all simple stuff and you don't need to go out and spend any money or book a pitch to do it.'

It was these activities that contributed to Andy and Jamie's success on the court, according to Judy.

'I believe that doing so many fun activities when the kids were small helped to develop good hand-eye coordination.

'Andy, as well as being a really good tennis player, was also an extremely good football player.

'Up to age 14 he was as much football as
 tennis and he opportunity to do something with Rangers when he was 14 -
 that's when he made the decision to go into tennis.

'And Jamie was a pre-handicapper at golf when he was 16.'

Doting: Judy famously loves mothering Andy and even used to rush out to buy thermometers to check his bathwater was exactly 37 degrees, as prescribed by his physio

The little things: Judy credits her son's success to the games she used to play with him when he was younger, which she maintains improved his hand-eye coordination

Her influence is clearly hugely important on her son and he wrote in his autobiography: 'My mum’s the one person who gets me, who understands me really well.'

When Murray lost to Roger Federer in the 2010 Australian Open final, he apologised to his mother, to which she replied: 'Andy, don’t ever tell me you are sorry. Have you any idea how great that is for me, watching you on one of the best courts in the world, playing against the best player of all time? Your time will come, never forget that.'

And yesterday it did, and his number one fan was there to help him celebrate the greatest day of his life in style.
