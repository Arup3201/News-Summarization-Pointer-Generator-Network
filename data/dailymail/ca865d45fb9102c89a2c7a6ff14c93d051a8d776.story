Police in northern Greece are investigating a cemetery worker's testimony that a woman was buried alive and cried for help from her grave - only to die before being rescued.

The man and two visitors to the cemetery told police officials that they heard banging and muffled shouts from inside the 49-year-old cancer patient's grave late yesterday, an hour after her funeral.

By the time the coffin was dug up and smashed open, the woman showed no further signs of life. A doctor summoned to Peraia cemetery outside Thessaloniki pronounced her dead.

The mother of two had been first declared dead at a private Thessaloniki clinic earlier the same day. A coroner will examine the body.

A doctor who examined the woman's body claimed that she could not have been buried alive, and had been dead for hours.

The woman was allegedly buried alive in Peraia, around 16 miles south of Thessaloniki

'I just don't believe it,' Chrissi Matsikoudi told Greek television channel MEGA. 'We did several tests including one for heart failure on the body.'

She added that 'someone in a state of rigor mortis' could not have been 'shouting and hitting the coffin like that'.

The dead woman's relatives are considering filing a complaint against the doctors who treated her at the cancer clinic.
