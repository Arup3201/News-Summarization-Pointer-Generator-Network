It can churn out a staggering 39million M&M's and 14million bite-sized Snickers every day.

This is the new $270million (£162million) Mars plant that has been opened to meet America’s demand for chocolate for the next 50 years.

The sprawling factory, built south of Topeka in Kansas, is the first plant in 35 years to be launched by the candy giant.

It aims to produce enough chocolate to meet U.S. demand for the next half century - churning out millions of M&M's, Snickers, Milky Ways, Twixes and other sweets every day.

Dozens of workers in white uniforms and hairnets cheered yesterday as the plant was officially opened by Governor of Kansas, Sam Brownback.

'Somebody doesn't put this kind of money in without having a long-term strategy,' said Mr Brownback, who was joined by Victoria Mars, chair of the board for Mars Inc., and Debra Sandler, president of Mars Chocolate North America.

'They see a long-term, solid play.'

As well as producing enough M&M's each day to fill 1.5million fun-sized packs, the 500,000sq ft plant is bringing about 200 jobs to the Topeka area.

It was built in the Kansas capital based on its central location, accessible site and work force. 

Matt Hudak, a market research analyst for Euromonitor International, today expressed support for the plant - saying that chocolate remains an 'affordable luxury' in uncertain economic times.

He said candy makers, such as Mars, can expect to see annual growth in the chocolate market - with sales staying above 3 percent.

'There is little reason to suggest that, all of a sudden in the U.S., people will start to dislike chocolate,' he said.

He added that Mars had been good at introducing new products, such as pretzel M&Ms and bite-sized Snickers, to keep consumers interested.

The new chocolate factory is a sign that Mars officials are well aware of the trend and are bullish about future sales.

Ms Sandler said nine other plants are currently operating at full capacity, while Ms Mars said the new plant will allow the company to end 'bottlenecks' in getting its products to market.

'I don't want to say to my customers that I can't fulfill their orders,' said Ms Sandler. 'Topeka will allow me the freedom to build the business in the U.S.'

The new plant will operate 24 hours a day for five days a week.

Mars Inc.'s New Jersey-based chocolate unit, Mars Chocolate, has more than 16,000 employees in 21 countries.

It produces 29 brands that include M&Ms and Snickers, which it says are billion-dollar brands, as well as Milky Way, Twix and 3 Musketeers.

The family-owned Mars Inc. also has its Wrigley division, which produces gum, hard candies and chewy candies. It also has non-candy food products, produces pet foods and runs pet hospitals.

Before the Kansas facility was built, the company's last new plant in North America was in Cleveland, Tennessee.
