Radamel Falcao will continue to score goals for Manchester United if he is given a run in Louis van Gaal's starting XI, according to his team-mate Michael Carrick.

The Colmbian, who has made just nine Premier League appearances since moving to Old Trafford on loan last summer, netted only his second goal against Aston Villa on Saturday.

But Carrick believes the former Atletico Madrid striker has what it takes to cement a place in United's starting XI after returning to full fitness.

Speaking after his side's 1-1 draw at Villa Park, Carrick told MUTV: 'He's scored so many goals over the years and you always feel that when he gets that chance he will score. He's scored a terrific header again today [Saturday] and I'm pleased for him.'

'After being out for a bit that's him back and hopefully he can go on a bit of a streak for us and we, as a team, can return to winning ways and get on a roll again.'

United had won six Premier League games in succession before their draw with Paul Lambert's side but now sit seven points adrift of Manchester City and Chelsea.

Despite Saturday's result, Carrick is confident the Red Devils will still be in a strong position after the busy festive period.

He added: 'Things are going okay, although we hoped for more [at Villa], but we didn't lose and hopefully we can carry that on over Christmas and be stronger for it when we come out on the other side in January.'

United host Newcastle on Boxing Day before a trip to Tottenham on December 28 and a visit to Stoke on New Year's Day.
