A car-lover forced to sell his beloved Porsche for money to raise funds for a start-up company 25 years ago has been given it back as a surprise retirement present from his business partner.

Businessman Dave Amos, now 65, used the £8,500 from the sale of his treasured sports car to launch his business, which is now worth millions.

But when Mr Amos announced his retirement, his business partner Bill Duke secretly flew 6,000 miles to track down the silver silver Porsche 911SC so he could give it back to his friend.

Mr Duke flew from his home in Texas to Britain, putting his amateur sleuthing skills to the test and within a week found the car in Kent, where it had been sold by Mr Amos in the 1980s.

After buying the car, Mr Duke then had the car driven to Pembrokeshire, west Wales, where Mr Amos was celebrating his 65th birthday at home with his family.

During the party Mr Duke took him outside where the gleaming Porsche was sitting in the drive.

'It was just one of those amazing moments - I could see a Porsche and thought one of my family had arrived in it,' said Mr Amos.

'Then I thought: "It looks a bit like my old one" - but even then I didn't realise what was going on.

'But I saw the registration number and realised it was my old car.

'I couldn't believe it when Bill handed me the keys - the last time I saw it was over 25 years ago.

'Bill had bought the car in Kent and my nephew Richard drove it down to Wales for my 65th birthday. I was completely bowled over.'

Engineer Mr Amos met Mr Duke when they worked together in Bahrain, using poorly designed scanning equipment to test for cracks in gas storage tanks.

In Mr Duke's native Texas the two friends designed a better machine to carry out the work but didn't have the cash to put it into production.

Father-of-one Mr Amos, who moved back to the UK on his retirement, said: 'Bill had four young children so it was a struggle for him and I didn't have any capital.

'But I did have the Porsche back home in Wales so I reluctantly decided to sell it.

'We used the cash from the car to build our first scanning machine and we never looked back from there.'

The successful US-based company, MFE Enterprises Incorporated, is now one of the world’s leading manufacturers of magnetic flux leakage tank floor scanners and is worth millions of pounds, selling inspection tools for storage tanks and pipelines across the world.

The three-litre Porsche 911SC , first made in 1978, is a design classic and Mr Amos's was in the colours of the Martini racing team.

Mr Amos said: 'It was my pride and joy, I'd always wanted one but I had to do the sensible thing and sell it.

'It got our business off the ground and we were very successful.

'I was lucky enough to have a couple of Porsches while I was living in the States.

'But I often wondered what happened to my first one - it was a bit special.'

Mr Amos sold his half of MFE Enterprises Incorporated last year to Mr Duke, whose four children now work in the family firm based in Austin, Texas.

When Mr Amos turned 65, Mr Duke flew over, and with a little help from Mr Amos's wife Sandra, managed to track the car down.

Mr Amos said: 'Apparently the owner didn't want to sell - he'd spent a lot of money on the car bringing it up to tip top condition.

'But Bill made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

'I think he felt he owed me for the sacrifice I had made 30 years ago and the Porsche was payback.

'But I never saw it that way - he's like a brother to me. He owed me nothing.'

Mr Duke, who was back in Texas today, said: 'It took a while but with the help of Dave's wife Sandra and his nephew Richard we found the Porsche after all those years.

'The problem was that the owner was in love with it, he had spent a lot of money on the car and didn't want to sell.

'But I sent him an email explaining the history of the car and what it meant to Dave.

'I must have touched a nerve because he emailed me back saying he was really moved by the story and he didn't feel as if the car was his any more. So we did a deal.

'Giving it back to Dave was one of the best feelings in my life - and he was gobsmacked as you say over there.

'In fact he actually sobbed and he's not an emotional guy.

'But it was my way of saying thank you for everything he did for me and my family - he is the nicest guy I've ever met.'
