A hungry puppy had to have emergency surgery after swallowing a dessert spoon whole, getting the cutlery lodged in his stomach.

Scooby the golden Labrador was being fed bread and butter pudding by owner Marie Regan when the cheeky dog turned ‘quick as a flash’ and ate the spoon from her other hand.

Ms Regan, 34, and partner Paul Cooper, 42, rushed the seven-month-old dog to Thanet Animal Hospital in Margate, Kent where he underwent a major stomach operation.

Mr Cooper, a photograph technician, said: ‘I couldn't believe he'd done it and I still can't quite. He didn't muck around with teaspoons. He went straight for the big one.

‘He often sits near us when there's food around and while we were eating bread and butter pudding Marie fed him some from her hand.

‘She was holding the spoon in her other hand and quick as a flash, Scooby went over thinking there might be food there too and took the spoon straight out of her hand.

‘When we saw that it wasn't in his mouth, we realised that he must have swallowed it but he didn't even flinch. He just carried on as normal.’

Vets tried to remove the spoon with 
an endoscope but discovered the cutlery was stuck firmly in Scooby's 
stomach and had to perform emergency surgery.

Head
vet Jill Matthews said: ‘I've taken all kinds of foreign objects out of
dogs but in 32 years, this is the first time I've removed a spoon.

‘It was a bit complicated because when I tried to use the endoscope, I couldn't get hold of it because the handle end was close to the beginning of the small intestine.

‘I had to remove it through the stomach wall, which is major surgery, but he's a young, fit dog and with painkillers he was able to eat breakfast the day after the operation and was well enough to go home. It will be about 10-14 days before he's fully recovered.

‘It was such a big spoon but Scooby is quite a large dog even though he's very young and a dog that size can easily swallow things like this if they go down the right way and Labradors are more prone to swallowing things before testing them.’

'He didn't muck around': Mr Cooper said Scooby went 'straight for the big one' when he turned and ate the spoon in Ms Regan's hand while being fed bread and butter pudding

It is not the first time Scooby has eaten something he should not have.

Mr Cooper said: ‘He's tried to eat smaller things such as the tops of Smarties tubes but we've always been able to get them off him before now.

‘He sometimes takes clothes out of the tumble dryer but he's never tried to chew them.

‘I'm so glad he's on the mend and I've been looking forward to getting him home because he is such a lovely character. It has been very quiet without him.’

Childcare worker Marie and Mr Cooper, from Ramsgate, Kent, who have four children, said Scooby is now recovering well at home.

Practice manager Heidi Purdy said: ‘When his owners brought him in, you would never have known that there was anything wrong, he was jumping around enthusiastically in reception and seemed totally happy.’
