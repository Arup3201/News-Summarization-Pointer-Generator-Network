Parents should avoid leaving children under five unsupervised in front of the TV, the creator of Jackanory and Play School warned today.

Joy Whitby, 82, who launched the BBC shows in the Sixties before working at ITV, is worried about ‘the glutting amount for children from early morning six till six’.

The Oxford history graduate, who gained a job on Play School after writing about how the Watch With Mother slot could be refreshed, said she was saddened by today’s ‘noisy, meretricious cartoons’.

Concerns: Joy Whitby (pictured second left at a London Weekend board meeting in 1969), now aged 82, is worried about 'the glutting amount for children from early morning six till six'

‘If I had a child under five at home again, I wouldn’t want to leave him in front of the television set unsupervised if I could possibly help it,’ Ms Whitby told the Daily Telegraph.

She said small children should not be ‘endlessly watching’, adding: ‘I have been to houses where that happens and I am horrified, because I think “I’m not sure you’re watching anything worthwhile”.’

Ms Whitby claimed the proliferation of children’s TV content during the day has resulted in a 'total loss of the sense of occasion’ and youngsters can’t look forward to a show they can get all the time.

She did praise the Horrible Histories series on CBBC but told the Daily Telegraph that the worst programmes on TV nowadays ‘exploit stereotypical characters’ and have ‘no real story’.

Good old days: Youngsters watch Prince Charles read a story on TV programme Jackanory in 1984. The hit show, along with Play School, was created by Joy Whitby

Modern: The manic antics of Spongebob Squarepants are hugely popular with children

Ms Whitby, who said she gained an interest in telling stories to children while working as a secretary, is concerned that programme makers no longer think about the very young who are watching TV.

The producer added that she has always been an ‘elitist’ and never enjoyed ‘audience-pulling shows’ which she only watched ‘out of duty, not pleasure’.

She said the industry had witnessed a huge change since the ‘old protective, uncommercial approach to children’s programming’.

Ms Whitby’s husband Tony, who was a former controller of BBC Radio Four, died in 1975. She is currently making a Christmas animated special of the Mouse and Mole series for the BBC.
