He was derided for his co-commentary analysis during the World Cup, but Phil Neville has found an avid admirer in Hollywood actress Keira Knightley.

The BBC received 445 complaints about Neville during England's 2-1 Group D defeat to Italy in June - with many criticising the former Manchester United and Everton star for his lack of emotion and 'monotone' style during the game.

Knightley, however, has come to the aid of Neville in a staunch defence of the 37-year-old.

'I didn't understand why Phil Neville got stick during the World Cup,' she said in an interview with ShortListTV.com  ahead of the UK release of her latest film The Imitation Game.

'I thought he was rather good, I didn't understand what the problem was.'

England's World Cup opener in Manaus attracted a peak audience of 15.6million viewers as Neville's co-commentary was quickly lambasted on social media. Many viewers took to Twitter to criticise him, with several joking that England physio Gary Lewin who was stretchered off after injuring his ankle had actually 'fallen into a coma' listening to Neville.

Knightley, who starred in the 2002 hit Bend It Like Beckham, is a huge football fan and joins a long list of famous West Ham supporters that include Ray Winstone and Russell Brand.

It's not the first time that the brunette beauty has been appraisal of a Neville after she described Phil's brother Gary's Sky Sports punditry as 'absolutely f****** amazing!' in March.

The 29-year-old also gave a positive review of Paul Scholes’ skills as a pundit following his retirement from football.

Scholes was notoriously media-shy during his playing days, but Knightley believes the former midfielder was perhaps rarely seen because he is so opinionated.

'Paul Scholes he's doing an amazing job [as a pundit],' she added.

'He never did interviews when he played but that perhaps maybe could have been because he is very very opinionated so they [Manchester United and England] "were like shut up, shut up, shut up." I like his blog.'
