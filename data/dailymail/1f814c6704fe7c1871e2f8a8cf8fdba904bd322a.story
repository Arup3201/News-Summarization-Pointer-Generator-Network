THE POET'S TALE: CHAUCER AND THE YEAR THAT MADE THE CANTERBURY TALES

Perhaps it is because contemporary life is intolerable that people are flocking back to the past.

They really can’t get enough of it, as the obsession with Hilary Mantel and Tudor politics demonstrates — though in my view, Mark Rylance and Damian Lewis aren’t a patch on Kenneth Williams and Sid James in Carry On Henry, which covered the same ground as Wolf Hall and more amusingly, too. ‘Has she been chaste?’ — ‘All over Normandy’, etc.

When at last 16-century history begins to pall — those lutes and galliards in a Renaissance court; the King’s matrimonial wrangles and the breach with the Papacy — my bet is we’ll crank backwards another couple of hundred years and become fascinated with all things medieval.

The son of a wine merchant, Chaucer grew up amidst the wharfs and warehouses lining the Thames

In anticipation of the next trend, Paul Strohm has written a pungent book about the ‘turbulence and change’ of the Middle Ages, when Latin and Norman French were mixing and merging to create the modern English language and hence the modern English identity.

It was a picturesque period — the tournaments and festivities, ‘jousting and lance-play’, the ‘lavish consumption and frivolous display’: Edward III spent millions on ribbons and taffeta embroidered with jewels. The fashion was for extravagant hats and ‘outlandish coiffures’, which make Alexander McQueen look like the Salvation Army.

Money came from the wool trade, ‘the nation’s most important income source’. The poet Geoffrey Chaucer worked as a controller in the wool customs and excise department, his job being to keep the accounts and collect tariffs and duties.

The son of a wine merchant, Chaucer grew up amidst the wharfs and warehouses lining the Thames.

He began his career in aristocratic service as ‘a genteel and versatile kind of errand runner’, known as a valet or esquire, before being promoted, as a ‘literate’ civil servant, to ‘the administrative bureaucracy of later Medieval England’.

An unpromising background for an artist, you might think. But then, T. S. Eliot worked in a bank and Philip Larkin was a librarian.

Strohm’s contention is that what Chaucer later wrote about in The Canterbury Tales was his direct recollection of rollicking London life — the ‘socially mixed body of pilgrims’ telling their stories, the fables, adventures and bawdy romps, were a version of what he saw going on out of his window.

This is where the book comes into its own, as a description of the city of London in the year 1374, when Chaucer first went up ‘an awkward circular flight of stone stairs’ into his apartment in Aldgate — one of the many fortified gatehouses surrounding the capital, when it was encompassed by thick, stone walls. It is hard to imagine now, when London is a big splodge, but 700 years ago, Westminster was a separate place from London proper, half-a-mile away along ‘clogged footpaths’.

Greenwich was a remote fishing village. Hampstead and Highgate were in the middle of deep countryside, with flocks of sheep.

But, in case this starts to sound idyllic, Strohm reminds us that next to Chaucer’s Aldgate was the open sewer known as Houndsditch, named after the kennels on the bank of the Thames maintained for hunting purposes.

Dead dogs were chucked in, along with the odd beggar, and ‘it stank to high heaven’. Also adjacent was the ‘extensive latrine’ maintained by Holy Trinity Church for the clergy. Add to this scene the felons’ and traitors’ heads rotting on spikes, and you realise a strong stomach was needed to survive in those germ-prone days.

The noise was deafening. Iron-wheeled carts rattled beneath Chaucer’s window, as did drovers, water-carriers and wood-sellers, shouting and yelling. There were continuous processions of convicts and chanting monks, who belonged to the innumerable religious fraternities.

Meals were eaten at taverns or from stalls in the street, purchased directly from street-side ovens. No health and safety regulations back then. Eating and drinking was supplemented by courtesans from ‘the stews of Southwark’ or ‘unlicensed brothels’ of Charing Cross plying their trade.

To such raucousness must be added the tolling and pealing of the parish bells, which began before dawn and ended only with the night curfew.

Many medieval legal cases involved trespass, disputes over boundaries and incursions on personal living space. This reflects the congestion of London — the populace fighting for a little privacy beyond the teeming and insanitary 12 ft-wide streets.

With privacy difficult to obtain (few could afford secluded chambers or an enclosed garden), sex could be a bit of a free-for-all, especially after dark when lanterns were extinguished.

‘Racy incidents,’ says Strohm, ‘were part of the fodder of daily life.’ Chaucer was always writing about bottoms being thrust out of windows, ladders conveniently being left next to open casements in readiness for a tryst, rumbles behind the arras, undone breeches around the ankles and so forth.

Democratic by temperament, he saw no difference between ‘a cheating wife of high degree . . . and a poor woman who engaged in the same conduct’. Both were wenches.

Oh, whatever happened to wenches? I used to love a good wench, me. Barbara Windsor and Diana Dors were wenches. Chaucer described a typical damsel approvingly as frike, or frisky.

He himself didn’t have much luck with the ladies, frike or otherwise. His wife, Philippa, lived apart from him in Lincoln, where she was a lady-in-waiting to Edward III’s 13-year-old queen.

Possibly owing to the enforced separation, Chaucer in his poems does dwell on the ‘mistakes, misapprehensions and woes’ of the marital state. The Wife of Bath, for example, has had numerous husbands — and she’s an archetypal wench. She has a little gap between her top teeth, which was considered saucy.

In 1386, at the age of 43, Chaucer was sacked, along with the other controllers who’d had their hands in the till. He left for Kent — Rochester, Sittingbourne and, of course, Canterbury — and he set down his classic saga, the ‘cacophony of competing speakers’, knights, yeomen, nuns, merchants, confidence tricksters.

Before the printing press, readers were of necessity ‘few and private rather than numerous and far-flung’. The manuscript fragments were assembled only after Chaucer’s death (in 1400), copied and recopied by professional scribes (55 manuscripts exist) and finally typeset in 1473, when paper superseded parchment.

Chaucer was the first writer in vernacular English, rather than in Latin. It’s not hard to follow — for example, say ‘nat worth a toord’ aloud and the meaning is plain.

As Strohm says, ‘human emotions and objectives remain recognisable across time’ and, when The Canterbury Tales was filmed by Pasolini in 1972, it starred Robin Askwith of Confessions Of A Window Cleaner fame. He knew plenty about shooting up ladders, absent hubbies and the bums of wenches sticking out of windows and wardrobes.
