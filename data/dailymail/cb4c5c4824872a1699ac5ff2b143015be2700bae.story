Every Sunday Reverend Martyn Pinnock offers communion to the congregation at his parish church in Cornwall.

But the cash-strapped vicar was forced to take up delivering a different kind of bread - by becoming a Sainsbury's delivery driver. 

The 66-year-old combines work for the church with two days a week behind the wheel for the supermarket giants.

Reverend Martyn Pinnock has taken a job as a Sainsbury's delivery driver because he is short of cash

He started working for Sainsbury’s five years ago but only regained his religious licence last November after marrying for the second time.

Rev Pinnock took charge of the Parish of Tregony and St Cuby with Cornelly near Truro in Cornwall.

The grandfather said: 'I’m doing both jobs because I need the money.

'The biggest problem is that having been made the vicar of the parish the church is paying me for half of the time but it’s impossible to be a parish priest for half of the time.

Rev Pinnock works for Sainsbury's for 10 hours on Mondays and nine hours on Tuesdays each week

'People ring me up when I’m driving. I have to sit down after a day’s driving and then work out what I’m going to say in the pulpit.'

Rev Pinnock works for Sainsbury’s for 10 hours on Mondays and nine hours on Tuesdays each week.

He returned to the UK in 2008 after a three-year spell in the United States where he worked for electronic company Plessey.

The vicar started working for Sainsbury's five years ago but regained his religious licence last year

At that stage he was still in the process of going through a divorce and was not allowed to hold a ministerial licence until he re-married.

He said ‘hefty legal fees’ from his divorce were reasons he was short of money.

'It is difficult to juggle two jobs,' said the vicar.

'If you’re a priest and particularly a parish priest, you are considering issues about parish life and everything becomes a bit of a juggling exercise.

'I did reduce my hours at Sainsbury’s, although due to the ten hour and nine hour shift, I am still quite busy and I do cover a big area.

'I’m not sure how long I plan on being at Sainsbury’s - a lot depends on what happens in the church and whether my role in the diocese changes from part-time to full-time.

'However, the idea of not working never appeals to me, I will carry on driving for Sainsbury’s for as long as they let me.'

He added: 'I’m thinking about the church all the time. I’m thinking about it but I don’t wear the collar when I’m driving.

'Church for me is about a style of life rather than banner-waving. It most certainly is about seven days a week and not just Sunday.

'I’ve always found that my instinct to be pastorally caring comes out. 

'You get elderly folk who are trying to be independent and you try and do as much as you can for them.

'We certainly go to more trouble for people in need.'
