A bride and groom were delighted when pantomime stars David Hasselhoff and Christopher Biggins became their star wedding guests.

The celebrity pair - who are playing Hook and Mrs Smee in an Essex production of Peter Pan - surprised Craig and Clare Shipman after having dinner at the same hotel where they had tied the knot.

The Knight Rider and Baywatch star and TV personality congratulated the 75-strong party and even appeared in a few photos for the wedding album.

Oh yes it is! This wedding party - including bride Clare Shipman (centre) - was delighted when local panto stars David Hasselhoff (third left) and Christopher Biggins (right) joined the festivities at their reception

Football coach Mr Shipman said: 'It was priceless - a brilliant way to top off the best day of my life. I lived the dream and married the woman of my life!'

The 32-year-old was celebrating after marrying 37-year-old Hermes courier Clare Curtis on Monday at the Roslin Beach Hotel in Thorpe Bay, Southend-on-Sea.

The Hoff and Biggins were having dinner in the hotel's restaurant after a performance at the town's Cliffs Pavilion, a couple of miles away, when friends asked if they would make the couple's big day.

To their delight, they came and gave the bride and groom a hug, along with her children Kai, 13, and Macie, six.

'It was brilliant,' said Mrs Shipman. 'Everybody is still talking about what happened.

'They were having dinner in another room with friends and they were asked if they would mind having their photo taken with us.

'They walked through the door and congratulated us and put their arms around us and Kai and Macie. All the boys shouted "It's Knight Rider!"

'We still can't quite believe it. It was great. We had a really wonderful day.'

The hotel's managing director Jackie Harris said Biggins is a frequent visitor.

'He loves staying here,' she said. 'He's a really lovely person. He and the Hoff were very gracious about it and didn't hesitate.'

Hasselhoff is playing Hoff the Hook and Biggins is playing Mrs Smee in Peter Pan at Southend's Cliffs Pavilion until Sunday, January 11.

The Hoff also had the honour of turning on Southend's Christmas lights more than six weeks ago.
