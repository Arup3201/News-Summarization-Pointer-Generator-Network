Justice for Steward: Leonardo Espinal, 49, has been sentenced to 20 years to life in prison for killing his 5-year-old son by lacing his children's pizza with rat poison 

A New York City man has been sentenced to 20 years to life in prison for killing his 5-year-old son and sickening his 7-year-old daughter with pizza spiked with rat poison because he was angry with his ex-wife.

After learning that his former spouse was seeing another man, Leonardo Espinal, 49, took it out on their children in November 2012 by tainting their meal with a deadly poison, Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson said Thursday after the sentencing.

The little girl, Mia, threw up after eating the pizza. When her brother, Steward, soiled himself, their father took him into the bathroom.

He then called Rosaura Abreu and threatened to commit suicide telling her, 'what is about to happen is your fault.' 

Espinal and Abreu had been together for about a decade before she kicked him out of their apartment two weeks before the domestic drama.  

The woman made a frantic phone call to Espinal's stepmother, who then contacted police. 

Officers broke down the bathroom door, only to find Espinal in the tub cradling his son's lifeless, naked body. 

Steward died from a combination of the poison and being submerged in water.

Mia Espinal was found sleeping in her own vomit on the couch.

At his sentencing Thursday, Espinal did not speak, but Justice Troy Webber had a strong message for the child killer.

'If only he had ingested that pizza and it had done its job,' she said, according to New York Daily News. 

The judge wondered aloud how a parent, or any human being, could commit such a heinous crime, and said: 'I'm glad to put you in prison.' 

Rosaura Abreu delivered an emotional victim impact statement that was written in Spanish, translated into English and read by a prosecutor in court.

'I will never forget the last time I saw my little son. ... He was radiant, happy, content and followed me all around the house.

'When it was time for me to leave, he followed me to the door and I knelt down to talk with him.  It's as if my heart knew that it would be the last time I would see him alive.'

On November 6, 2012, Steward told his mother that he loved her as she was about to leave their University Heights apartment. They hugged and she said 'that I loved him from the bottom of my heart, more than own life.'

After the crime, Mia Espinal suffered anxiety attacks at the mere mention of returning to the apartment. 

Crime scene: The murder took place in the family's West 179th Street apartment in The Bronx 

'She never wanted to sleep in the same bed where she slept with her Steward, protecting him from monsters,' their mother said.

Therapy has helped them, but is by no means a cure-all.

'Mia suffers a great deal when she goes to parties, when she goes to bed, when she plays with other children, when she sees photos of him, when she sees another boy the same age as him, when she sees me sad because she knows I am thinking of him,' Abreu said.

Espinal pleaded guilty last month to murder and attempted murder.

'All we can do,' said Abreu, 'is take it day by day.' 

Assistant District Attorney Jill Starishevsky stated: 'Mia will have to live the rest of her life with the horrific memory that her own father caused in attempting to kill her,' according to News 12 The Bronx.
