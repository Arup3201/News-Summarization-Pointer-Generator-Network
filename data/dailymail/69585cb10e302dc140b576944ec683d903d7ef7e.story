When Fern Britton was asked to present The Big Allotment Challenge, no one could have known how appropriate a choice it was. For gardening has not only been her hobby and passion, it’s what saved her in her darkest hours.

Fern tells today how she has struggled with depression for decades – and while she has also relied on medication in the past, it is the simple pleasure of being in the garden that has proved the best cure.

She reveals for the first time how gardening lifted her out of the pit of despair and rescued her from a painful divorce. ‘However busy I am, I always find time to garden,’ Fern says. ‘It does my head good.

Ferne Britton said that featuring on the Big Allotment Challenge pulled her out of her darkest hours

During those times when I was unwell and depressed and feeling under pressure, I’d go out into the garden and hours would slide by. It’s the most wonderful therapy.

‘There have been periods in my life when my garden has been particularly important to me. I’ve always thought nurturing something is good for the soul. It’s also good  for your physical and emotional welfare when you can’t see your way out of such despair.’

The 56-year-old is now happily married to TV chef Phil Vickery. They have a 12-year-old daughter, Winnie, and Phil is a loving stepfather to Fern’s children from her first marriage – twins Harry and Jack, 20, and Grace, 17 today.

Fern has enjoyed a prosperous career, presenting ITV’s This Morning for ten years before going on to have her own chat show. And in addition to her latest BBC2 series – in which teams tend plots at Mapledurham House in Oxfordshire as they seek to impress the judges with their fruit, veg and flowers – she recently published her fourth novel. Yet for all the outward success, Fern spent years on antidepressants, only giving them up 18 months ago.

‘I always thought I would be on them until I died, because why would I want to stop taking something that was keeping me stable?’  she says.

‘Then something changed and I said, “You’re going to be all right. All the s*** in your life has happened. Nothing can be worse than it has been – you can do it.”

‘I don’t have manic depression, which is a shame really, because it would be nice to feel some highs. But I’m just somewhere underneath the medium line all the time.’

Fern had her first experience of depression as a child and has suffered attacks throughout her adult life.

Things were so difficult at one point that she planned to crash her car into a brick wall.

When she was 21 she was raped but decided not to tell police. She wrote about the attack  in her 2008 autobiography, My Story, sparking fierce debate about the rights and wrongs of leaving such crimes unreported.

The television star came under further attack that year when it was revealed that her 5st weight loss was nothing to do with sensible eating (she was advertising Ryvita at the time) but was thanks to secret gastric surgery.

But even when she was young continuity announcer on Westward Television in Devon, the garden was her sanctuary. Fern says: ‘I lived in the Tamar Valley in Cornwall, just over the bridge from Plymouth, in a cottage I rented from a farmer.

He let me use a small space in his greenhouse where I tried my hand at growing tomatoes. What I didn’t know was that you had to pinch out the leaves to let the trusses set. But the farmer set me straight and I did get some good results in the end.’

Then, in the first house she bought nearby, she planted gladioli and a willow tree. ‘I’d spend weekends in the garden, planting and digging and sowing a lawn with seed.

‘I readily acknowledge that this wasn’t perhaps the pastime of your average 25-year-old but my mother and father [the actor Tony Britton] were enthusiastic gardeners so it was something I grew up with.’

Gardening would again prove a solace when her first marriage, to TV executive Clive Jones, fell apart at the end of the Nineties. Fern found herself a single mother to three children aged under five.

‘I’d be on my own at weekends when the kids were  with their dad,’ she says. ‘I took to the garden as a form of therapy, planting hundreds of daffodils and visiting local garden centres for unusual flowers and plants – seeing my geraniums come into bud gave me real joy. Still does.’

Although she can smile about it now, Fern was at her lowest ebb back then. Even now, 15 years later, her eyes glisten with tears as she says: ‘When you’re very emotional, you get brain tired but not physically tired. That’s when you can’t sleep, however much you want to shut out all the pain.

‘So digging for all I was worth in the garden was a way of getting physically exhausted. My hands would be sore, and my knees and shoulders would ache. I’d get into a hot bath and perhaps have a glass of wine before going to bed and enjoying a deep, replenishing sleep.’

Perhaps, most of all, in the garden Fern doesn’t have to pretend.

She explains: ‘It doesn’t involve wearing make-up or looking smart. I don’t have to be smiling or be “life-is-golden Fern Britton.” I don’t have to look as if I haven’t a care in the world. If there have been occasions when I wanted to cry – and quite often there were – then I cried.’

Life is brighter now. She married Phil in 2000 and the couple live in a beautiful house set in two acres in Buckinghamshire with the children and Phil’s labrador Max.

Fern says: ‘I was in my mid-40s by the time I had Winnie so we were incredibly lucky to be blessed with a child. Phil and I always say we got in just as the late-night shops were shutting their doors.’

Phil is also a keen gardener and has planted an orchard in the grounds of their home. ‘Yes, he’s out there, stripped to the waist, shifting rocks and splitting logs,’ Fern laughs.

‘A real lumberjack, a proper hunter/gatherer. Phil also has an obsession with grass. I’m responsible for the decorative border, as it were, as  well as the vegetables. I try to get out in the garden every day.

It might just be for 20 minutes to open up the greenhouse and water everything but it’s for longer at weekends.’

Apart from writing fiction – her latest novel, A Seaside Affair, has just been published – her chosen private pursuit is being mirrored by her professional life. On its first outing a couple of weeks ago,

The Big Allotment Challenge attracted over 2.5 million viewers, the second most watched show that evening after hospital drama Holby City.

Last week, ratings fell slightly as football fans (Phil included) opted to watch Chelsea’s Champions League semi-final, but the presenter says BBC is ‘very happy’ with the show’s performance.

As a Twitter convert, Fern is also happy to report that the show was ‘trending’ on Twitter last week – although she admits she has no idea that actually means.

‘Almost all the tweets were positive although one person did say my bottom was as big as a pumpkin but that’s fair enough,’ she laughs.

So will there be a new series of the Big Allotment Challenge in 2015?  ‘I honestly don’t know,’ Fern says while simultaneously tapping the side of her nose with some vigour.

Certainly, she wouldn’t need to be asked twice to host a second series. ‘I absolutely loved it, but then there’s something so bonding about working with a group of people dedicated to their precious plots of land.

‘If I’m lucky enough to know that my last hour is approaching, I’d ask someone to wheel me out into the garden because that’s where I’d like to die. To lie on the grass and look  at the leaves against the blue sky is a kind of prayer in itself.’
