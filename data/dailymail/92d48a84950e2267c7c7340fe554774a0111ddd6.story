Controversial new 'flexitime' arrangements are allowing Whitehall officials an extra three days holiday a month if they work over 36 hours a week, it was revealed today.

More and more civil servants are working nine-day fortnights by cutting lunch breaks short and staying in the office until 6pm, allowing them extra holiday.

Whitehall staff can even factor delays getting to work due to traffic into their contracted working week, according to a leaked document seen by the Daily Telegraph.

Whitehall departments are said to be like 'ghost towns' on most Fridays thanks to generous contracts which allow civil servants an extra three days holiday a month

The generous contract schemes are indicative of a system which has 'hardly any controls' and sees some departments resemble 'ghost towns' at the end of most working weeks, according to one government source.

The revelations are also likely to infuriate scores of company bosses in the private sector, where employees are usually contracted to a rigid 40-hour week.

And it comes just days after plans emerged to let civil servants work from home for seven weeks during the Olympics and Paralympic Games in London this summer.

The revelation is likely to infuriate business leaders not long after William Hague said companies should 'work harder' to boost growth

The arrangement, according to the Civil Service document, is based on the standard working week in London being 36 hours, with a working week being 37 hours outside the capital.

This equates to the normal working day being slightly longer than 9am to 5pm, with an hour-long lunch break each day.

Employees in the Civil Service are allowed to not take a full lunch break of work extra hours in return for accumulated overtime which they can take as time off later the same month.

All Civil Service staff are eligible for the flexitime arrangement, according to the document seen by the Telegraph.

A government aide told the newspaper: 'When we came into office we inherited various arrangements from the last government. We are reviewing these to ensure that they are reasonable and sensible.'

Business leaders had only this week reacted with dismay to news that civil servants will be allowed to work from home during the Olympic Games.

They said it sent out the dangerous message that Britain would close down for almost two months.

The special dispensation, which is supposed to limit transport chaos in London, will extend from July 21 – six days before the Olympics opening ceremony – until the Paralympics ends on September 9.
