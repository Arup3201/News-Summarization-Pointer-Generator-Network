These stunning images of London at night reveal the city's sea of lights  and the dazzling shine of an art installation to commemorate the start of WWI.

Taken some 800ft above the capital from the viewing platform at the Shard, they capture some of the capital's most famous landmarks and a 40-mile view of the city.

The light from Spectra, the column of light unveiled on the 100th anniversary of the start of the Great War, shines brightly above the rest of the capital.

Stunning: These images taken from London's highest viewing point at the Shard show a sea of multi-coloured lights which make up the city by night 

The installation shone brightly above  Westminster Abbey and the rest of the darkened city on Monday while the country turned out its lights in remembrance of the beginning of the Great War on August 4 1914

Commissioned by the Mayor of London, it will shine for one week and is made up of 49  spotlights shooting 15 miles into the air, which visitors at Victoria Tower Gardens are encouraged to walk among.

Created by Japanese artist Ryoji Ikeda and Artangel, it appeared in the sky on Monday without warning while the rest of the city turned off the lights as part of a national campaign of remembrance.

In other images, an east facing view shows the dazzling lights of Tower Bridge reflected in the Thames with the blurred glare of moving traffic in surrounding roads also visible. 

Visitors at the View on the 69th-72nd floors of the Shard can take in the views from 800ft above ground. The three-storey attraction is almost twice as high as any other viewpoint in London.

St Paul's Cathedral, one of the capital's oldest landmarks completed in 1708, stands out against modern buildings in the historic city of London

A west facing view from the Shard on Tuesday shows the twisting Thames and its lit up bridges with the London Eye and St Paul's Cathedral among landmarks in view 

On Monday the capital joined the rest of Britain in turning out its lights in homage to an observation made by Lord Grey on the eve of the war in 1914 when the lamps went out 'all over Europe'. 

Homes and businesses in many parts of the country were lit by a single candle or light between 10pm and 11pm, the hour in which prime minister Herbert Asquith declared Britain had entered the First World War  August 4, 1914. 

Other centenary attractions include a sea of ceramic poppies at the Tower of London where 888,246 flowers have been planted in honour of every life lost by the British or colonial forces during the war.
