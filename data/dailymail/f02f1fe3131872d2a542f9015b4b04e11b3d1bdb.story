A furious goat went on the rampage around a Brazilian town and attacked anyone who dared to cross its path.

The animal was videoed as it butted a motorcycle and its two riders and floored a woman carrying her shopping through the streets of Londrina, near Sao Paulo. 

One man, who thought he could beat the goat at its own game, was also knocked to the ground.
