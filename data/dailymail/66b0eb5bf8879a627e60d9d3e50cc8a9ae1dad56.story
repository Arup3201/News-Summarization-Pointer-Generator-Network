A star was born in Colombo – but Moeen Ali’s twinkling century could not save England in the first one-day international against Sri Lanka.

As Ali caressed his way to the third-fastest one-day hundred by an England batsman, it felt like caviar and champagne compared with the top-order stodge that has too often weighed them down.

But, of the rest, only Ravi Bopara could pass 35. And if that spoke volumes for the quality of Ali’s innings, then it also confirmed a familiar tale: not for the first time, England’s 50-over team had come up short.

Set 318, more than they have ever chased to win a one-dayer, they were all out for 292. Close, but no cigar.

For Ali, though, this could be the start of something special. Back in June against the same opponents, he had exhibited his more stoical side, batting virtually all day to take England to the brink of a famous draw in a Test at Headingley.

Now he vindicated the management’s decision to promote him to the opener’s role, carving his first delivery over the covers and barely pausing for breath en route to a 25-ball half-century.

On Friday, across town at the Sinhalese Sports Club, Ali had got there in 21 balls, smiting the first six of them to the fence. The magic had not deserted him.

‘He has an amazing ability to time a cricket ball from the word go,’ said Alastair Cook. ‘It was extraordinary. It’s just frustrating not to win a game when you have a hundred like that.’

Ali was lucky to survive on seven, when the ball rolled back on to the stumps without shifting a bail, and again on 72, when Jeevan Mendis spilled a straightforward chance at deep midwicket.

But the plea from England’s new batting coach Mark Ramprakash has been to loosen shackles – and that is rarely achieved without a risk or two.

Ali understands this, and it was a joy to watch him use his feet to lift left-arm spinner Rangana Herath for successive leg-side sixes. His century needed just 72 balls: only Jos Buttler and Kevin Pietersen have scored faster one-day hundreds for England. It was as if, said Mathews, he was ‘batting on a different pitch’. 

In the end, Ali had to settle for 119 off 87 after a providing leg-spinner Mendis with an anticlimactic return catch. Yet what, you wondered, might he have achieved had anyone been able to stay with him?

In some cases, the contrast was almost painful. Twice in two balls during the first over, Cook was given out leg-before to his opposite number Angelo Mathews. Twice he asked for reviews, with Ali his advisor from the non-striker’s end; twice Hawk-Eye ruled the ball was going over the stumps.

By the time Cook was given out leg-before a third time – to the first ball of spin sent down by Sri Lanka from Tillakeratne Dilshan – he had contributed a scratchy 10 from 17 balls.

The England captain has now gone 40 one-day innings without a century, yet his status continues to protect him against the more persuasive claims of Alex Hales.

For Michael Vaughan, one of Cook’s predecessors, it was all too much. ‘Please please England,’ he tweeted. ‘Allow ‪@AlexHales1 to open with Mo....’

Ian Bell made a pleasant run-a-ball 35 before nibbling at Thisara Perera’s bustling seam, but failures for Joe Root and Eoin Morgan – who has gone 13 innings without a fifty – meant Ali had to slow down and take stock.

And when Buttler chopped Dhammika Prasad on to his stumps for 21, England had lost four for 52. Bopara, back in the side at the expense of Chris Jordan, did his best, but the damage had been done.

Earlier, the England attack – without Steve Finn, who was nursing a groin niggle – fell apart as Tillakeratne Dilshan’s 88, plus fifties for opener Kusal Perera and Mahela Jayawardene helped Sri Lanka to an imposing 317 for six.

James Tredwell’s off-breaks were steady under fire, and Chris Woakes looked menacing until his last over leaked 21. But Harry Gurney gave away 66, and Ben Stokes 36 in four overs.

Why Bopara was given only four overs himself – going for a relatively miserly 15 – was a mystery. Just as concerning was that England bowled 17 wides.

For a while, it looked as if these flaws might be forgotten and forgiven. But Ali was running out of partners. Soon, both he and England ran out of luck.

The second delivery brought what seemed a costly slip by Ben Stokes at long-on, his fumble allowing Mathews to get back on strike for a two - and he then hit the next two balls for six.

But the Sri Lanka captain's bid for a hat-trick of maximums foundered when Stokes held his nerve under a high ball at long on.

Tredwell then strangled Jayawardene caught-behind down the leg-side, and it was he instead on a hat-trick - a curiosity feat he must try to complete in England's next match.

For the second time in the innings, England had taken two wickets in quick succession - an effective stalling mechanism, until late hitting from Jeevan Mendis helped to plunder an ultimately telling 54 in the last five overs.
