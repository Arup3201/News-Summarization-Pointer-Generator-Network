Little miracle: Keiron Guess recovering from the attack at home with his mother Stacey

To see his brave smile, you would 
hardly believe that it is only six weeks since two-year-old Keiron Guess
nearly lost his life when a neighbour’s crazed dog ripped his face to 
shreds.

The toddler was 
given a 50/50 chance of surviving the savaging by the pet, thought to be
a Staffordshire bull terrier or similar.

Although
the dog was destroyed, its owner cannot be prosecuted because the 
attack took place in a private garden, rather than on a public street.

Yesterday,
Keiron’s parents called for action to close this ‘loophole’ in the 
Dangerous Dogs Act.

Unlike in Scotland or Northern Ireland, the law in 
England allows ‘devil dog’ owners to escape prosecution in cases such as
this.

The dog, named Ratty,
belonged to 15-year-old Shovell King and his unemployed father Garfield
King, of Swindon.

And far from showing any shame or remorse for the 
attack, Shovell later took to Facebook to declare: ‘I couldn’t give a 
toss.’

His father blamed the
boy’s parents for not keeping a closer eye on him, insisting: ‘If 
you’re a parent you have to look after your children 24 hours a day. If 
it wasn’t a dog it could have been a paedophile.’

Last
year, during a drugs raid at the house, the dog had attacked two police
officers and not even a blast from a Taser stun gun could subdue it.

Yesterday,
Keiron’s mother, Stacey Drury, 22, said: ‘You don’t see a child looking
like Keiron, because they don’t normally survive an attack like that.

'Doctors gave Keiron just a 50/50 chance of survival. It’s nothing short of a miracle that he is here at all.’

Before the attack: The toddler needed seven hours of surgery to rebuild his face after being attacked by Shovell and Garfield King's Staffordshire bull terrier Ratty outside his home in Swindon

Keiron
spent a week in a coma, and even when he came round it was several days
until the family realised the sight in one of his eyes had been saved.

'Like father, like son': Garfield King, whose 15-year-old son Shovell said he 'couldn't give a toss' that his dog had savaged little Kieron

His
father Anthony Guess, 25, said: ‘We weren’t sure how much he would be 
able to see out of his eye until my dad visited and he shouted out, 
“Grampie!”’

Keiron is now 
out of hospital, but his mother says: ‘He used to be happy and smiley 
all the time. Now he does have bursts of anger. And he has terrible 
nightmares and he’ll wake up dripping with sweat and screaming and 
thrashing about.

‘He saw a dog in the street the other day and he was petrified and said, “Dog bite, dog bite!”.’

The
couple told of the moment when doctors gave them just ten seconds to 
kiss their mauled son goodbye before taking him for immediate surgery, 
warning that it could be their last chance to see him alive.

Miss
Drury said: ‘I couldn’t kiss his face – it wasn’t there any more. So I 
kissed his stomach and told him, “Mummy loves you”.’

It
is only thanks to the expertise of surgeons who performed a ten-hour 
operation that Keiron, who had to have most of his face reconstructed, 
survived.

The attack 
happened on the Jubilee Bank Holiday weekend early last month, as the 
couple were at their home with Keiron and their other son, four-year-old
Mackenzie.

Keiron’s 
grandfather, Dave Guess, 49, had been helping to renovate the family’s 
bathroom and walked out to his van when the two boys followed.

Their
mother, who is pregnant with the couple’s third child, said: ‘Seconds 
later we came out. We could see Mackenzie –but not Keiron.’

They
began a frantic search and realised that the toddler had wandered into 
the Kings’ back garden only when another neighbour yelled: ‘A dog’s got 
him! A dog’s got him!’

Despite
being bitten himself, Mr Guess Snr managed to get Keiron away, and his 
son said: ‘I saw Dad with Keiron cradled in his arms, but it didn’t look
like Keiron.

'All I could see was bubbles of red coming out of his face.
His nose had gone.

‘His eye was ripped open. Basically his whole face had been ripped to shreds.

‘It was horrific – like something from a horror film. Not something you see in real life.’

Paramedics
arrived within minutes, followed by an on-call doctor, police cars and a
helicopter ambulance which landed in the nearby park.

During the mayhem, Keiron’s ear, which had been found near the scene, was handed to paramedics in a handkerchief.

Mr Guess Jnr recalled: ‘Stacey was on the floor crying. Some bloke was trying to comfort me because I was just in tears.

‘You’re
meant to protect your kids aren’t you? More than anything I was angry.

'I
kept thinking this shouldn’t have happened. Someone is to blame.’

Last
night Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman said: ‘Every dog owner 
needs to be held responsible for what their animal does and we want to 
change the law so that if your dog mauls someone on private property, 
you will face prosecution, as happens if an attack takes place in 
public.’
