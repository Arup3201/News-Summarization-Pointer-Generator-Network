Mojang announced on its official blog that it is teaming up with Telltale Games to create the spin-off called Minecraft: Story Mode.

Minecraft: Story Mode will be a 'cool', narrative-driven game about Minecraft and will launch 'some time' in 2015.

Mojang has announced it is teaming up with Telltale Games to create a spin-off called Minecraft: Story Mode. Minecraft: Story mode will be a 'cool', narrative-driven game about Minecraft and will be launch 'some time' during 2015 - although the exact date wasn't announced

But the developers did not reveal the exact date of release, in its official post. 

Minecraft: Story Mode will be available on Xbox consoles, PlayStation consoles, PC, Mac, iOS, and Android-based devices.

Earlier this month, the original Minecraft: Pocket Edition game was made available on Microsoft's Windows Phone for the first time.

Microsoft bought Mojang in September in a deal said to be worth $2.5 billion (£1.5 billion).

Although Story Mode will be compatible with Microsoft's own Xbox range, as well as its Windows software, there was no mention of it being launched on Windows Phone. 

At the start of the game, a character called Steve is put into a 'virtually infinite game world' (pictured)

Minecraft was created in 2009. 

At the start of the game, a character called Steve is put into a 'virtually infinite game world.'

They
 can then walk around different terrains, including mountains, forests 
and caves.

Players can also fly up in the air for a birds-eye view of 
the landscape.

Players are 
given blocks and tools to build towns and cities.

The game was initially made for the PC but there are now Xbox 360 and mobile versions available.

'We’re not intending on creating an official story for [character] Steve, or explaining the world of Minecraft in detail,' explained Mojang. 'It will be a cool game.'

Telltale, which makes 'The Wolf Among Us', added: 'As 2014 comes to a close, we are delighted to confirm our partnership with Mojang to create a new episodic game series based on one of the most popular video games in history - Minecraft.

'Set in the world of Minecraft, the series will feature an original story, driven by player choice. 

'It will not be an add-on for Minecraft, but rather a separate standalone product that will premiere in 2015 on consoles, computers and mobile devices.'

The firm said the game series will mix new characters with familiar themes, in an 'entirely original Minecraft experience, inspired by the Minecraft community and the game that continues to inspire a generation.' 

Minecraft founder Markus Persson sold the hugely-popular game to Microsoft in September.

After the deal was finalised, Mr Persson left the company. 

In a statement released at the time, Mr Persson said: 'I'm leaving Mojang. 

'A relatively long time ago, I decided to step down from Minecraft development. 

'Jens [Bergensten] was the perfect person to take over leading it, and I wanted to try to do new things.

'I was at home with a bad cold a couple of weeks ago when the internet exploded with hate against me over some kind of EULA situation that I had nothing to do with. I was confused. I didn’t understand. I tweeted this in frustration.

'I’m not an entrepreneur. I’m not a CEO. I’m a nerdy computer programmer who likes to have opinions on Twitter.

'As soon as this deal is finalised, I will leave Mojang and go back to doing Ludum Dares and small web experiments.

'Considering the public image of me already is a bit skewed, I don’t expect to get away from negative comments by doing this, but at least now I won’t feel a responsibility to read them.

'I’m aware this goes against a lot of what I’ve said in public. I have no good response to that.

'I love you. All of you. Thank you for turning Minecraft into what it has become, but there are too many of you, and I can’t be responsible for something this big.

Minecraft founder Markus Persson sold Minecraft to Microsoft in September, in a deal that was said to be worth $2.5 billion (£1.5 billion). The latest Windows Phone version (pictured) includes all of Minecraft’s mobile features, including Survival mode, Creative mode and multiplayer features when played on Wi-Fi networks

'In one sense, it belongs to Microsoft now. In a much bigger sense, it’s belonged to all of you for a long time, and that will never change. It’s not about the money. It’s about my sanity.'

Minecraft is available on PCs and for Xbox Live on the Xbox 360, and in the last two years it has become the top online game for the Microsoft console.

Mr Persson created Minecraft in 2009 before releasing it widely in November 2011.

At the start of the game, a character called Steve is put into a 'virtually infinite game world.' They can then walk around different terrains, including mountains, forests and caves.

Players can also fly up in the air for a birds-eye view of the landscape. 

Players
 are given blocks and tools to build towns and cities. As a player 
progresses they can earn advanced tools and building blocks in different
 materials. 

More than 16,645,000 people have bought the game, so far, and it is an online phenomenon.

There are even YouTube channels dedicated to showing people how to play the game, which in same cases make the owners enough money in advertising to quit their jobs. 

The Windows Phone game also includes new biomes, caves, mobs and villages (pictured)
