Victim: Pistorius fired four shots at girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp

Reeva Steenkamp's mother has revealed she forgives Oscar Pistorius for shooting dead her daughter.

The astonishing show of compassion comes a day after June Steenkamp, 67, attended the start of the Olympic athlete's murder trial so that she could come face-to-face with her daughter's killer.

'It's actually important to forgive him 
for me, because I don't want to live with bitterness in my life,' she told the Today show on Tuesday morning. 'It 
would become my whole being. I don't want that.'

'He made a mistake - 
an enormous mistake - and I've lost the most precious thing in my life -
 my beautiful daughter... But still I can forgive. I can forgive.'

Mrs Steenkamp, who was seen dabbing 
her eyes throughout the court proceedings in Johannesburg, South Africa 
on Monday, said she had appeared in court for her daughter.

'I wanted to see Oscar face-to-face so he would know I was there,' she told Savannah Guthrie.

'I wanted him to see me. I'm the mother 
of Reeva. It's just important for me that he saw me there. I can't 
explain to you why but that's what I wanted yesterday.'

But she said that the Olympic athlete was unable to look her in the eye.

'He just walked into the courtroom and looked straight ahead and never looked my way at all,' Mrs Steenkamp said.

In a separate interview with ITV Mrs Steenkamp also revealed that 
Reva's father, Barry, has not been in court because he had suffered a 
stroke due to stress over her death.

She
 said her husband was 'devastated' by the build-up around the trial, and
 didn't come to court because he would have 'suffered another collapse'.

Blocking it out: Pistorius covers his ears in court on Tuesday, where attorneys detailed Reeva's injuries

She said the experience of the trial had been 'traumatic', adding that the worst part was hearing about Reeva's death.

She said: 'There was one occasion where I didn’t 
keep strong and I had a little breakdown, you know where they were 
talking about Reeva, what she went through and how she was traumatised.

'I wish I could have been there to protect her. That’s my child that I gave birth to and it’s hard for me that she’s dead, that she’s gone.

'That was the time I broke down. The screaming…you know. That was my child there that was screaming, that was injured and dying.'

Her 29-year-old daughter was killed by Pistorius, a double amputee who is known as the Blade Runner, on February 14 last year after she got up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom.

Accused: Prosecutors say Pistorius planned the murder but he claims he mistook Reeva, left, for a burglar

Pistorius has claimed that he awoke to
 sounds in the bathroom and thought it was an intruder, so he reached 
for his gun and shot multiple times at the bathroom door.

After
 hitting her with three out of four bullets, he opened the door to find 
her body and carried it downstairs as he waited for authorities.

Prosecutors allege the athlete had planned the early morning Valentine's Day murder.

When asked if she had noticed any 
cracks in her daughter's relationship, Mrs Steenkamp said she barely 
even knew Reeva was in one.

'I
 actually never met him,' she said of Pistorius. 'She didn't speak about
 him in the beginning so I don't know the history of the short 
relationship.'

She added that she was not going to speculate on what had happened that night but that she hoped Pistorius would tell the truth.

'Only she and 
Oscar were there and she's not here anymore,' she said. 'We want the truth. It's not
 going to matter anything to me whatever happens to him, because she's 
not coming back.

'I don't wish him any harm.
 I just want the truth.'
