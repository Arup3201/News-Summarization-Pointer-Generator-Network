The crystallized remains of a young athlete valued at $15,000 have gone missing.

The parents of 25-year-old Kyle Thomas sent his remains to a Swiss company that makes diamonds from cremated ashes after losing their son in an Australian football accident.

Tragic loss: 25-year-old Kyle Thomas died in an Australian football accident.

The Thomas family ordered two very special diamonds and paid $15,000 for the pair of gems. However, their order arrived as an empty box, KPRC Local 2 reports.

The company, Algordanza, which operates 
an office in Houston, Texas, told the local news outlet that is looking 
for answers after shipping its client’s package via UPS.

It is unknown what happened to the 
diamonds after being shipped. Algordanza employees believe they were 
stolen somewhere between Singapore and Australia because they were able 
to track the package up to that point.

‘This is pretty much 
what we consider priceless,’ said Vincent Campise, one company employee.
‘These diamonds are made from the cremated remains of the family's 
loved ones which would be invaluable to someone else but priceless to 
the family.’

Algordanza has been in business since 2004 and told KPRC Local 2 nothing like this has happened before.

A UPS spokeswoman said that is protocol to work with the local authorities to investigate any allegations of theft.

Special gems: Thomas's parents paid $15,000 to have his ashes turned into diamonds.

Algordanza, a Swiss company that makes diamonds from cremated ashes, is on the search for their client's order after they reported receiving an empty box.

Hot water: Algordanza founder Veit Brimer says: 'I was devastated. This is just not happening. I thought it was not real, this is a bad dream.'
