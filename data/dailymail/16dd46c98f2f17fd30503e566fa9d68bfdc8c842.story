One of Tulisa Contostavlos' friends today admitted supplying cocaine to an undercover reporter as the former X Factor judge went on trial for allegedly setting up the drug deal.

Michael Coombs, also known as rapper Mike GLC, pleaded guilty to supplying the Class A drug when he appeared at London's Southwark Crown Court alongside the former N-Dubz star.

Contostavlos, 26, is due to stand trial after she denied being concerned in brokering the alleged drug deal which was exposed by the Sun on Sunday.

On trial: Tulisa Contostavlos arrives at court today where her friend Mike GLC, right,  admitted dealing drugs in a deal she is accused of brokering

It is claimed the singer told undercover reporter Mazher Mahmood, better known as the 'fake sheikh', that she could arrange for him to buy cocaine from Coombs between May 20 and May 24 last year. 

Contostavlos, of Friern Barnet, north London, denies helping Mr Mahmood to obtain 0.5oz (13.9g) of the Class A drug for £860.

Wearing a white short sleeved shirt and black trousers, Coombs, 36, of Enfield, north London, pleaded guilty to a charge of supplying the drug on May 23 last year.

The deal happened at the five star Dorchester Hotel in London's exclusive Mayfair district.

Contostavlos arrived at court today with her PA Gareth Varey and wore a white blazer, black dress with a colourful floral pattern.

Allegations: The Crown believes the singer set up the £860 deal for the drugs, which changed hands at the Dorchester in a sting by the Fake Sheikh Mazher Mahmood

Friends: Contostavlos was given a kiss by Mike GLC, right, as he left the dock today. He will be sentenced at the end of Tulisa's trial, which starts tomorrow

She had her long dark hair out in waves down by her shoulders. 

Contostavlos was officially dropped as an X Factor mentor days before her arrest in June last year, with Sharon Osbourne replacing her on the talent show.

She sat next to Coombs in the glass fronted dock and spoke clearly to confirm her name and plead not guilty.

Coombs gave Contostavlos a quick kiss on the cheek and hug and stroked her face as he left the dock.

Bailing Coombs, Judge Alistair McCreath told the rapper he would be sentenced at the end of Contostavlos' trial.

Dropped: Contostavlos left the X Factor, where she was a mentor, days before her arrest in June last year, with Sharon Osbourne replacing her on the talent show

He said: 'Michael Coombs, I'll sentence you at the conclusion of the proceedings against your co-defendant, whatever that conclusion may be.

'In the meantime I'll permit you to keep your bail, but you must understand that that consists of no sort of indication as to what sentence you'll get at the end of it.

'On that understanding you may go.'

A jury is due to be sworn in later today, and the prosecution will open the trial tomorrow.
