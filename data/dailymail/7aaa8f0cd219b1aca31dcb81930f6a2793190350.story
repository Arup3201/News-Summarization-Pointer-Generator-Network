Sevilla remain on course to retain their title after easing past fellow Spanish side Villarreal.

Having done most of the damage with a 3-1 first leg win at El Madrigal, Sevilla finished things off at home.

The Red and Whites secured their progression with a 2-1 victory courtesy of second-half goals from Vicente Iborra and his replacement Denis Suarez.

Villarreal had netted in-between those strikes through Giovani dos Santos' fine free-kick but almost immediately had centre-back Eric Bailly sent off as they tumbled out 5-2 on aggregate.

In truth it could have got a whole lot worse for Villarreal if not for goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo who impressed throughout.

Sevilla's victory could provide a significant psychological blow as both sides prepare to do it all again in their La Liga clash this weekend.
