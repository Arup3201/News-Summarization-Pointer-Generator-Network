Jonathan Joseph sent a clear warning to Ireland after his man-of-the-match performance inspired England to an emphatic Six Nations win over Italy.

The Bath centre grabbed two of England’s six tries at Twickenham and claimed his best is yet to come in the tournament. England’s next game is in Dublin on March 1 - a showdown between the two remaining unbeaten teams after Ireland saw off France 18-11 at the Aviva Stadium. His Bath team-mate George Ford added 15 points with the boot.

Joseph, 23, has been hailed as the ‘new Jeremy Guscott’ with his silky running prowess and dashing finishing skills. He said: ‘It’s great to be compared to someone like him. He was someone with such class and ability who had such a great career with Bath and England.

The comparisons come from the silky running prowess and finishing skills that the two players share

Joseph scored two tries in a world-class display for England against Italy at Twickenham

After also going over against Wales, Joseph now has three tries to his name in this year's RBS 6 Nations

'But it’s up to me to keep working hard and keep my feet on the ground. I am not the finished article and can get better. I just want to try to be the best I can. It felt great to get two tries in an England win but things move on quickly and you can’t sit back and relax.’

Joseph was forced to move out to the wing after full back Mike Brown went off with a head injury early in the first half. But the reshuffle didn’t faze the Bath man, who said: ‘I feel I can play either centre or wing but I prefer centre.

'I try to deliver on a regular basis and I need to keep pushing myself. I have trained and worked hard at Bath. I’ve found that if I stay close to George he usually creates something for me. Credit to him today because he helped me go over the whitewash.

‘Missing out on New Zealand last year was a big blow for me. It hurt. But missing that opportunity made me even more determined to get where I wanted to be.

‘I didn’t have a great season and had injuries. But it was a realisation that a lot of my friends were out there and that’s where I wanted to be.’

The 47-17 win at Twickenham saw some early mistakes from England which need to be ironed out

Joseph set his sights on the battle with Ireland and said: ‘It will be another big one and there are a few errors to iron out. Ireland are a tough side and it will be a massive challenge. We will have to prepare well for that game.’

But Stuart Lancaster said his young side, who beat Wales in Cardiff last Friday, lacked intensity in defence early on as Sergio Parisse crossed.

The head coach said: ‘I am disappointed really. I thought we lacked the intensity we had in defence last week. We addressed it in the second half but the last try was a frustrating one.

‘I guess at the start of the day, if someone had said we would get 47 points, I would have taken it. I know how good and how difficult this Italian team are to play against having been 18-11 this time two years ago.’

England lost Brown to a worrying injury after 10 minutes and Lancaster hailed his bravery. The full back was left unconscious after a collision with Italy centre Andrea Masi and had seven minutes of treatment before being taken off on a stretcher.

The Azzurri backline struggled to deal with Joseph, and Ireland will be wary of him too

The 29-year-old reappeared on the touchline in the second half and will undergo strict return-to-play protocols before being considered to face Ireland.

Lancaster said: ‘It was a very dangerous moment. It was a great chip over the top and — typical Mike — he was brave and it was a try-saver.

‘He is talking fine now and he seems OK. It certainly helps the fact that it is two weeks and a day (until Ireland) but we will take him through the return-to-play protocol. I spoke to him in the changing room and he was grumpy that he had to miss the game and frustrated — but he is grumpy anyway.

‘We have a training week coming up and he won’t take any part in that. We will see how he goes in the lead-up to the Ireland game.’

Brown’s injury came at the worst possible time for a sport facing a huge challenge to combat an alarming rise in head injuries over the past decade.
