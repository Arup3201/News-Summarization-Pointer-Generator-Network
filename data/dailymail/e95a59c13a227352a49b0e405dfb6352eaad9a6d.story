'BANG!': Robin Clark, 44, slipped and re-opened his leg wound after colleagues played a prank on him

A City broker who was shot in the leg by a balaclava-wearing gunman ended up in hospital again after a cruel joke on his first day back at work.

Robin Clark, 44, needed hospital treatment after pranksters sneaked up behind him and shouted 'bang!'. He fell over and re-opened his leg wound from the shock.

Mr Clark, dubbed 'The Wolf of Shenfield' in light of his City boy lifestyle, was blasted in the thigh with a shotgun at close range by an unknown attacker last month in the car park of an Essex train station.

As he recovered in hospital from the initial shooting, where he was given armed police guards, Mr Clark said he had 'no idea why someone would want to hurt me like this.'

RP Martin, the firm where Mr Clark works, declined to comment on the incident. He is understood to have returned to work.

British Transport Police have made no arrests in the case, though they said that they are investigating and have no doubt that Mr Clark was deliberately targeted.

The gunman approached Mr Clark at 5.55am on Friday January 24 in the car park of Shenfield station. Using a sawn-off shotgun, he fired once at point-blank range, leaving a fist-sized wound.

Surgeons later said that the blast was just inches from severing major arteries in Mr Clark's leg.

Speaking from his hospital bed to The Sun after his attack, he said he through he was going to die.

He told the paper: 'I said a quick prayer because I thought this was going to be the end. I thought I was going to bleed to death before any help would come.'

Mr
 Clark, a twice-divorced father-of-four, last year rented out his 
£2.2million five-bedroom house in nearby Ingatestone after running into 
debt.

After the incident, pictures emerged of his lavish lifestyle, where he was pictured next to Formula One drivers and models in a previous job.

While working in the U.S., Mr Clark had brought in salaries as high as £1million a year after being appointed to a senior position on a huge financial merger.

However, friends said the broker had been suffering money worries in more recent years, and was saddled with debts.

Last year a 
county court judgment was filed against him for debts of £14,653, and he 
was director of a number of companies that were shut down while owing 
money.

The day before the shooting Mr Clark had tried to sell his Range Rover for £10,000.

Attack: Mr Clark was shot in the car park of the station at 5.55am

Former home: Mr Clark had lived in this £2.2million house in the village of Stock, Essex

He
 is thought to have already sold two Porsches. Luxury car dealer Steve 
Hurn, from Stowmarket in Suffolk, said Mr Clark had been a ‘prolific car
 buyer’ until he went through a ‘messy divorce’ around 18 months ago.

Over the past few years he had bought a number of expensive cars including Lamborghinis, Ferraris and Maseratis.

Mr
 Hurn said: ‘His great love is classic cars and particularly Porsches. 
But from what I understand Robin is having a few money difficulties.'

Mr Clark works as a euro derivatives trader at RP Martin, a  brokerage firm in the City of London.

Affluent Shenfield is 24 minutes by train from central London and is popular with City workers.
