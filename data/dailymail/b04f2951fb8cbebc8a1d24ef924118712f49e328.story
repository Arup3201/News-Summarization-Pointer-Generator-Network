A rum named after famed porn star Ron Jeremy has been pulled from shelves in parts of Canada after customers complained it was obscene.

The country's liquor authorities ordered stores in the province of Manitoba to remove bottles of the alcohol from shelves late last week.

The product is called Ron de Jeremy and features an image of Jeremy's face on its label above the slogan 'the adult liquor' and 'long smooth taste.'

Manitoba Liquor and Lotteries spokeswoman Andrea Kowal said they 'erred on the side of caution' after it received several complaints from rum-lovers.

But on Thursday the rum was back in stores, after the liquor authorities deemed the bottle unoffensive.

'There's nothing offensive about the name of the product or its label; you have to know who Ron Jeremy is and what his former profession was — and then that has to offend you,' Kowal told Canada's The National Post.

The man behind the Ron Jeremy-dedicated booze said he was thrilled his product was back on shelves.

'I'm just happy this whole drama is behind us and we can work on getting rum to the Canadian people,' Olli Hietalahti, the CEO of One Eyed Spirits, told the news service.

The furor over Ron de Jeremy comes a week after the adult film legend tweeted a picture of himself showing he's on the mend after a near-fatal aneurysm. 

In the photograph, tweeted on February 6, the porn star is seen giving a thumbs up to camera - with a smiling, comely nurse leaning over his bedside.

Jeremy accompanied the photo with the words: 'Thank you ALL for the concern & well wishes, I'm doing very well thanks to modern technology! - Ron.'

The star was pictured wearing a hospital gown and with an oxygen tube around his face.

Jeremy's agent said the actor will likely stay at a Los Angeles hospital to recover from an aneurysm near his heart for some time.

Agent Mike Esterman said Jeremy wasn't allowed to receive visitors or deliveries following a recent procedure at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, and added that he doesn't expect the 59-year-old to leave the hospital 'for some time.'

Jeremy had a heavy feeling in his chest after eating a honey-glazed donut and drove himself to the hospital on January 30.

Jeremy's
 father, Arnold Hyatt, told reporters at the time: 'Right now everything 
is in a holding pattern. He's heavily sedated and intubated.

'The 
doctors are waiting to see what develops. They anticipate it will be two
 or three days before they take him off the respirator.'

The pop culture icon has undergone two surgeries as doctors
 battle to stabilize him.

'It was an eight-hour procedure to 
begin with, and then there was some bleeding around his valves, so they 
had to go in for a second time to stop the bleeding,' Mr Hyatt, 94, told 
the New York Daily News.

Ron
 Jeremy was eating donuts at a rehearsal for a show 
based on legendary porn film Deep Throat the day before he was admitted 
to hospital.

'He has a lot of friends and his brothers close by,' Hyatt added. 'There are a lot of people praying.'

When he was once asked about an unprecedented 
career in adult entertainment that has seen him ranked No. 1 on the AVN 
Magazine's list of the 100 Top Porn Stars of all time, Jeremy remarked 
that it was his family that put him on the right path.

'I attributed that to great parents,'
 Jeremy said, bragging that he'd also remained STD-free. 'It's good 
genes and being very careful.'

The 59-year-old cult figure was due 
to have a cameo in his friend, Dave Bertolino's play about the landmark 
1970s adult movie when the high-calorie delivery arrived.

'I was trying to steer him towards 
the vegetable platter. But you know what they say about Ronnie, he never
 turns down food or work,' said Bertonlino.

Jeremy
 has appeared in more than 2,000 adult films throughout his life and 
left behind a career in teaching to become a porn star.

 in various music videos, non-adult films and television shows and 
reality serials throughout his career which began in the 1970s.

In addition to his adult film career, Jeremy appeared on 'The Surreal Life,' 'Tosh.O' and 'Chappelle’s Show.'

He later became a consultant of feature films that
 featured adult films in their premise, such as 'Boogie Nights.' He was
 also a guest on Anthony Bourdain's 'No Reservations' reality television
 series for season 5 and 6.

His sense of humor and everyman appearance has been seen as key to his success over the years.

Jeremy
 is nicknamed 'The hedgehog' and has been a household name for at least 
thirty years for his work in the adult film industry.

Jeremy has won countless awards throughout his career, and he was ranked by AVN at number one in their 'The 50 Top Porn Stars of All Time' list.

The actor's real name is Ron Jeremy Hyatt and he originally hails from Queens, New York.

His father Arnold was a physicist and his mother worked as a book editor and served in the O.S.S. - the direct predecessor of the CIA during World War Two.

As a young man, Jeremy attended Cardozo High School in Bayside, Queens, where former CIA director George Tenet was a classmate.

Before he began his career in porn, he earned a bachelor's degree in education and theater and a master's degree in special education from Queens College in New York.

Not fully-retired from pornographic films, he is still cast in many non-sex roles and is an advocate for pornographic films as a whole.

The star is reported to have been booked to appear at a Super Bowl Sunday party this weekend in Dedham, Massachusetts, although it is not yet known if he will be well enough to honor the commitment.
