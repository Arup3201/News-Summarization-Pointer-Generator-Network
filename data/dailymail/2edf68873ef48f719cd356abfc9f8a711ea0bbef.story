A former Moulin Rouge showgirl who enjoyed a lavish globe-trotting lifestyle was on the run yesterday after being exposed as a brazen benefits fraudster.

Mother-of-two Dawn Orton, 47, had claimed incapacity benefit for an injured shoulder and for 13 years received welfare payments as a lone widow struggling to make ends meet.

In reality she played badminton, enjoyed skiing trips and even went scuba diving with sharks while claiming to be disabled.

The supposedly poverty-stricken  
single mother also failed to inform officials she was in a long-term 
relationship with a company director who took her on 41 foreign trips in
13 years.

Orton kept her fraud secret from 
partner Marc Lissimore, 47, who discovered the truth only after she left
him for an American yacht salesman in 2010 and he opened her mail to 
find she was being pursued by the Department for Work and Pensions.

She was prosecuted for defrauding 
taxpayers out of £29,000, but the total value of her false claims may 
have been as high as £100,000.

Orton eloped with a new lover and refused to return to the UK for her trial at Hull Crown Court.

She was convicted of benefits fraud 
and sentenced in her absence to 12 months’ jail. An international 
warrant has been issued for her arrest.

Dawn Orton, 47, a benefit cheat, laughs as she arrives at court for a preliminary hearing in October. She was found guilty of failure to declare a change in circumstances

Glamour: Dawn Orton poses on the balcony of her holiday in Gran Canaria in 1998. Orton, who was in a relationship, claimed Widowed Mothers Allowance, which only single people are entitled to.

Judge Jeremy Richardson QC said Orton 
had written to inform the court she was on holiday in Spain and 
suggested the hearing move to Gibraltar to accommodate her – a move he 
branded ‘audacious’ and  ‘massively impertinent’.

The court heard Orton was a dancer in her youth and worked all over Europe, including at the famous Moulin Rouge in Paris.

She started claiming incapacity 
benefit for a shoulder injury, but was able to play badminton at her 
local club in Cottingham, East Yorkshire, during that time and also went
skiing, the court heard.

She also bought a nearly new  Mercedes car, which the judge described as ‘even more audacious’.

Luxurious: Orton in front of the temple of Abu Simbel in Eygpt in 2005. She paid for the holidays with the money she scammed

After the death of her husband in 1996
she switched her benefit to the higher Widowed Parents Allowance. To 
receive the payment, currently £105 a week maximum, the claimant must 
not be in a relationship, the court heard.

Later that year she began a 
relationship with Mr Lissimore, described by the judge as ‘akin to 
marriage’, and failed to report her change of circumstances to the DWP.

The judge said Orton had obtained at least £29,000 from public funds ‘which she was not entitled to’.

This is based on the assumption that 
her disability claim was genuine, and is the difference between the 
widow’s allowance and incapacity benefit.

Jet setter: On a flight to Lanzarote in 2004. She fled to Spain in late 2012 and is now the subject of an international arrest warrant

Performer: Orton was a professional dancer and appeared at venues all over the world, including the famous Moulin Rouge in Paris

However, if the judge’s ‘suspicion’ 
had been proved that Orton was also never entitled to incapacity 
benefit, the total value of her fraud would have been about £100,000.

Orton lived with Mr Lissimore in a 
£280,000 five-bedroom house in Cottingham and they also bought a craft 
shop together where she worked part-time.

Speaking outside court, Mr Lissimore 
said he had lost £130,000 in a financial agreement with Orton over their
split. ‘I couldn’t believe it when I found out she had been claiming 
all this money,’ he said. ‘Her whole life has been about greed.’

Orton was not in touch with her sons Reece, 19, and CJ, 22, he said.

Orton now faces an investigation under the Proceeds of Crime Act to claim back the ill-gotten gains.
