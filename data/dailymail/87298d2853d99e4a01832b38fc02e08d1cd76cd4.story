Researchers have found evidence of what could be the first carpenters at work.

Archaeologists in Germany found the 7,000 year old wooden water wells near Leipzeg,

They are the oldest known wooden constructions in the world, and contradict the common belief that metal was necessary for complex timber constructions.

The four constructions found near Leizeg, which are believed to be the earliest wooden constructions ever found

The farmers cleaved the trunks into boards, assembling them to make chest-like well linings with complex corner joints.

Using
 state-of-the-art laser scanning technology, the scientists collected 
data on the timbers and tool marks and documented the highly developed 
woodworking skills of the early Neolithic settlers.

The very well-preserved tool marks and timber joints testify to unexpectedly sophisticated timber construction techniques.

They were built by the Linear Pottery culture, which existed from roughly 5600 to 4900 BC.

A research team led by Willy Tegel and Dr. Dietrich Hakelberg from the Institute of Forest Growth of the University of Freiburg has succeeded in precisely dating four water wells built by the first Central European agricultural civilization with the help of dendrochronology or growth ring dating.

The team's findings, which have been 
published in the international scientific journal PLoS ONE, give new 
insight into prehistoric technology.

The wells were excavated at settlements in the Greater Leipzig region and are the oldest known timber constructions in the world.

The researchers were able to piece together exactly how the world's oldest carpenters made their water wells

'A total of 151 oak timbers preserved in a waterlogged environment 
were dated between 5469 and 5098 BC and reveal unexpectedly refined 
carpentry skills,' the team said.

'The recently discovered water wells enable for the first time a 
detailed insight into the earliest wood architecture and display the 
technological capabilities of humans ~7000 years ago.'

The study was conducted by archaeologists and dendrochronologists from the Institute of Forest Growth in Freiburg, the Archaeological Heritage Office of Saxony in Dresden, and the Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL in Birmensdorf, Switzerland.

The four early Neolithic wells were constructed from oak wood.

In addition to the timber, many other waterlogged organic materials, such as plant remains, wooden artifacts, bark vessels, and bast fiber cords, as well as an array of richly decorated ceramic vessels, have survived for millennia hermetically sealed below groundwater level.

With the help of dendrochronology, the scientists were able to determine the exact felling years of the trees and thus also the approximate time at which the wells were constructed.

The tests revealed that the wood comes from massive old oak trees felled by early Neolithic farmers with stone adzes between the years of 5206 and 5098 BC.

Researchers found a selection of preserved pots and even an ear of corn on the first of the four wells

The farmers cleaved the trunks into boards, assembling them to make chest-like well linings with complex corner joints, and using fire to cur them to size.

Using state-of-the-art laser scanning technology, the scientists collected data on the timbers and tool marks and documented the highly developed woodworking skills of the early Neolithic settlers.

The very well-preserved tool marks and timber joints testify to unexpectedly sophisticated timber construction techniques.

In the course of the sixth millennium BC, the nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle gave way to a sedentary lifestyle with agriculture and stock breeding in Central Europe.

Â This break in the history of 
humankind has been termed the 'Neolithic Revolution.' A sedentary 
lifestyle required permanent housing, and houses are inconceivable 
without a developed woodworking technology.

'in other words, the first farmers were also the first carpenters,' the researchers wrote.

'Permanent settlement structures and agricultural production systems 
required fundamental innovations in technology, subsistence, and 
resource utilization.'

Until now, however, archaeologists have only succeeded in unearthing the soil marks left by their houses.

The
 precisely dated wells will enable scientists to conduct more detailed 
studies on the important role of timber construction techniques for 
humankind's adoption of a sedentary lifestyle.

'Our results question the principle of continuous evolutionary 
development in prehistoric technology, and contradict the common belief 
that metal was necessary for complex timber constructions,' the researchers claimed.
