Peeping Tom: Declan Crosbie was given a community order after he pleaded guilty to attempting to spy on the Chinese Olympic swimming team in a women's changing room

A Peeping Tom was spared jail by a lenient judge today after being caught trying to spy on members of the Chinese Olympic swimming team at a training pool.

Declan Crosbie, 25, was caught peering over the top of cubicles as members of the team were getting changed at a sports centre in Leeds.

But a judge at Leeds Crown Court said he thought the public would be better protected from Crosbie by a community order rather than sending him to prison because it would guarantee he would go on a sex offenders’ treatment programme.

A previous hearing heard how a woman reported seeing Crosbie enter the changing room alongside members of the Chinese team, who were training at the pool ahead of the London 2012 Olympics.

She made made a complaint after spotting him looking over the top of cubicles while they were changing.

When staff at the centre went to find the 25-year-old, he hid in a cubicle and tried to answer them in a woman’s voice.

He then came out and begged staff not to call the police before running away.

Crosbie, from Lea Farm Place, Leeds, later handed himself in to police and pleaded guilty last month to trespass with intent to commit a sexual offence.

The defendant was jailed for three years
in 2009 after trespassing in a private home and he was found standing 
over a sleeping student, whose trousers had been pulled down.

He also has convictions for voyeurism in 2005 and 2006. The court was told Crosbie was already on the sex offenders’ register.

The Edge training facility at Leeds University was being used for training by the Chinese Olympic swimming team, but Declan Crosbie was trying to spy on them getting changed

Today, the Recorder of Leeds, Judge 
Peter Collier QC, said the 2009 jail sentence was passed in the hope 
Crosbie would be sent on a treatment course but it never happened.

Peter Collier QC said sparing Crosbie from a jail sentence would guarantee he would attend a sex offenders' treatment course

Giving him a three-year community order, Judge Collier said this would guarantee he would attend the course.

He
said: 'I’m satisfied it is on the public interest and long term 
interest of better protection of the public that I make a community 
order in your case today.'

The judge barred him from entering any female changing area or toilet for five years.

A judicial source familiar with the case said: ‘Sentencing guidelines allow that in cases of voyeurism, as opposed to someone filming sexual activity and making it public or posting it online, that community orders as opposed to custodial sentences are accepted.

'With a custodial sentence you can’t mandate for a course of treatment whereas you can when a community sentence has been handed down.

'The judge has used his power to ensure the defendant gets treatment. Sentencing is to prevent reoffending as well as protecting the public and the sexual treatment course is a preferred course of action to a custodial sentence in some cases.’

At the last hearing, the judge queried if the case should be dealt with under special fast-track Olympic rules.

He said it was technically an Olympic offence but there was no suggestion the defendant knew who the women were.

Crosbie sat listening to the judge in the dock dressed in a grey suit and black tie, flanked by a security officer.
