A four-year-old baseball fan has suffered a shattered forehead and bleeding on the brain after being hit by a ball at a minor league game - but the brave youngster didn't even cry.

Noah Stotler was cheering for Florida's Jacksonville Suns with his brother and dad on Saturday July 5 when a line drive from the other team sent the ball soaring towards the stands.

'All I 
heard was the crack of the bat, the sound of it hitting him, and that's 
all I could - I couldn't get it out of my mind,' Brian Stotler, 
Noah's father, told WJXT.

But the little boy didn't cry and his face looked fine - so his dad didn't think he had been hit. Still, Noah was checked out by EMTs at the game and the family then headed home.

Brave: Noah Stotler suffered a brain bleed and a shattered forehead after he was hit by a baseball in a minor league game. The four-year-old's parents did not know he was hurt because he did not cry

But once there, Noah started being sick and stumbling over his sentences, so his parents took him to a nearby clinic for further tests.

A CT scan showed he had a brain bleed, so Noah was rushed to Wolfson Children's Hospital.

There, doctors learned that he had an epidural brain hematoma, shattered forehead and an orbital roof bone fracture - and doctors said he was lucky to be alive.

'The doctor
 told us that if he had been looking up and watching if the ball would 
have hit him in the face, the outcome would have been very different,' Mr Stotler said.

Fears: His dad, Brian, became emotional as he revealed doctors said the accident could've been deadly

On the mend: Noah underwent surgery on his skull and remained in the hospital for a week

In surgery, doctors performed a craniotomy and put titanium plates and screws in his head to repair the damage, FCN reported.

He has been left with a scar on his hairline and a bruised eye, although doctors say his eyesight will not be affected.

As soon as he came to, he asked if the Suns had won their game against the Chattanooga Lookouts, his father said. (They did, 3-2.)

While Noah has been in hospital, he has been visited by Suns players and their mascot, Southpaw.

Chris Peters, General Manager for the Jacksonville Suns, said the team wanted Noah to visit them when he was back on his feet.

'Whenever he can and he's able, we are going to bring him out here and let him hang out with the players for a day,' he told FCN.

He was released from the hospital on Saturday.
