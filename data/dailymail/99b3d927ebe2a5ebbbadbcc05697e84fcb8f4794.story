Arsenal face an injury crisis with Jack Wilshere set to miss four months after ankle surgery yesterday.

And manager Arsene Wenger will be handed an increased January transfer budget to help bolster his injury-hit squad. 

Wilshere had his left ankle ligaments operated on following Manchester United’s 2-1 win at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday. And captain Mikel Arteta is also facing a battle to play again this year after suffering a calf tear in the 2-0 win over Borussia Dortmund.

Wilshere posted a picture of his ankle in a cast after the operation and insisted he will return soon

Wilshere was injured during Arsenal's 2-1 defeat by Manchester United at the Emirates Stadium last Saturday

It leaves Wenger with three recognised senior midfielders — Aaron Ramsey, Mathieu Flamini and Tomas Rosicky.

After the operation Wilshere posted a photo on Instagram (left) to reassure fans that the surgery had gone well.

‘Ankle needed surgery in the end,’ he wrote. ‘Went well thanks to the main man James Calder (the surgeon)!

The midfielder has been beset by injuries, and will have missed 119 weeks of football by the time he returns

Wilshere was clearly in pain after the tackle and it is unlikely that he will be back for Arsenal before March

‘You have to be strong and courageous and know that you can do anything you put your mind to. If somebody puts you down or criticises you, just keep on believing in yourself and turn it into something positive.’

Now Arsenal will give Wenger more funds than the £20million earmarked for a central defender in January.

Bayer Leverkusen’s Lars Bender remains Wenger’s first midfield option, but Sevilla’s Grzegorz Krychowiak is also being considered.

Wilshere could be back in training by February, but it will take some time to get back to full fitness
