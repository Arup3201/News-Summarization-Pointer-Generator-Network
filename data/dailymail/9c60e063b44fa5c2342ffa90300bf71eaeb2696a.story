Joe Paterno contacted a powerful Washington defense attorney, one day after Penn State University fired him in connection with the sex abuse scandal that rocked the university and college football fans across the country.

The legendary head football coach hasn't been charged in connection with the crimes and is listed as a cooperating witness into the case against former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky.

Sandusky, who was once the top choice to succeed Paterno as head of the Penn State football program, is accused of molesting eight boys over 15 years - including some at university practice facilities.

Worried: Joe Paterno reached out to a powerful defense lawyer because he's concerned about the potential for criminal charges and likely civil lawsuits

The 84-year-old Mr Paterno is concerned about new investigations by the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office, as well as his liability in civil lawsuits from Sandusky's alleged victims and their families, NBC News reported.

Analysts have predicted Penn State's liability from the scandal, and alleged cover-up, could cost the university $100 to $250 million.

A a result, Mr Paterno's advisers reached out to J. Sedwick Sollers, a Washington defense lawyer who represented President George H.W. Bush during the Iran-Contra scandal.

Powerful lawyer: Sedwick Sollers, the Washington defense attorney Mr Paterno reportedly contacted, represented President George H.W. Bush in the 1980s

Mr Sollers has not met with the former coach yet and not official retainer agreement has been signed, according to NBC News.

As a result of the allegations, Mr Paterno could lose his chance at receiving the nation's highest civilian award.

Pennsylvania
Sens. Pat Toomey, a Republican, and Bob Casey, a Democrat, both pulled 
their nominations for the coach to receive the Presidential Medal of 
Freedom, citing the recent scandal.

Republican Rep. Glenn Thompson, who 
also nominated Mr Paterno, wouldn't say Thursday whether he would 
withdraw his support, as well.

The politicians submitted Mr Paterno's
name in September for the award, citing his contributions to athletics 
and higher education.

Rocked: The sex abuse charges against former Penn State football defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky brought Mr Paterno's storied career to a screeching halt

Also arrested: Athletic director Tim Curley (left) and vice-president for finance and business Gary Schultz (right) were charged with failing to report the allegations to police

In
2002, assistant coach Mike McQueary, who was a graduate assistant at 
the time, saw Sandusky molesting a 10-year-old boy in the showers at a 
football practice center and reported what he witnessed to Mr Paterno, 
according to a grand jury indictment.

Paterno told athletic director Tim 
Curley and vice-president for finance and business Gary Schultz, who 
failed to report the incident to police, authorities said.

Both Curley and Schultz have been arrested and charged with a cover-up.

All three men say they are innocent of the charges.

On
Wednesday Penn State trustees fired Mr Paterno and university president
Graham Spanier for not doing enough to stop and report the alleged 
abuse.

More trouble: Prosecutors in San Antonio, Texas, are investigating whether Sandusky abused a boy during the 1999 Alamo Bowl. It was Sandusky's last game and he was carried off the field by his players

Mr McQueary will keep his job at Penn
State, but will not coach in Saturday's game against Nebraska. 
University officials have said it is for his own protection, as he has 
received threats since news of his involvement broke.

Sandusky's lawyer, Joseph Amendola 
disputes the 23-page grand jury indictment, which includes graphic 
testimony, and has claimed his client is being unfairly tried in the 
court of public opinion.

The
arrests, firings and allegations of sex abuse left the university 
stunned. Mr Paternoc has been at Penn State for 45 years and holds the 
record for the most wins of any coach in Division 1 college football.

More
than 4,000 Penn State students rioted in the streets after news the 
trustees sacked Mr Paterno. They burned fliers, tore down light posts 
and tipped over a news van.

Riots: More than 4,000 students rioted after Mr Paterno's firing Wednesday. Thousands more poured into the streets to protest the move

The students threw rocks and bottles at police, who eventually used pepper spray to disperse the crowd. 

The support for Mr Paterno could take 
an embarrassing turn at the game Saturday, when friends and family of 
the Penn State football players wear white to honor their former coach, 
called 'JoePa.'

However, 
that plan could compete with fans, who plan to wear baby blue in support
of Sandusky's alleged victims, according to TMZ.com.

Legal trouble in the sex abuse case could extend far beyond Pennsylvania.

The
district attorney in San Antonio, Texas, is considering bringing 
charges against Sandusky after he traveled to the city for the 1999 
Alamo Bowl, the last game before his retirement, according to the San 
Antonio Express-News.

Forever changed: Students view a mural at Penn State that once included a painting of Sandusky. However, his image his since been removed, replaced with an empty chair

“Victim
4 was listed, along with Sandusky's wife, as a member of Sandusky's 
family party for the 1998 Outback Bowl and the 1999 Alamo Bowl,” the 
indictment states. “... Sandusky did threaten to send him home from the 
Alamo Bowl in Texas when Victim 4 resisted his advances.”

The U.S. Department of Education is also investigating whether anyone in the case violated at federal law known as the Clery Act, which requires colleges and universities to publish information about criminal offenses that are reported to school authorities.

Education Secretary Arne Duncan said in a statement: 'If it turns out that some people at the school knew of the abuse and did nothing or covered it up, that makes it even worse. Schools and school officials have a legal and moral responsibility to protect children and young people from violence and abuse.'
