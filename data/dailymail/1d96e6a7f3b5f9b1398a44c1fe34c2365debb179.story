A gold and white version of the black and blue dress that sparked a global online debate over its appearance has raised more than a thousand pounds for charity. 

Roman Originals, who made #thedress that went viral, produced the new version in order to raise money for Comic Relief.

The garment was sold to a businessman from the Czech Republic on ebay for £1,356.78, with the dress company matching the fee, meaning the final total came to £2,713.56.  

This one really IS white and gold! Roman Originals, whose blue and black dress went viral, have produced a gold and white version. It has been bought by Tomas Petru from the Czech Republic for £1,356.78

Roman Originals, who made the dress originally worn by Cecilia Bleasdale for her daughter Grace's wedding decided to make the white and gold version to help out a good cause - it was auctioned off on ebay, with the bidding ending today.

The winning bidder was Tomas Petru, a business man from the Czech Republic who fought it out against 52 other bidders to buy the item for his wife as a gift.

She will now fly over to the Birmingham-based store to be fitted for the lacy shift.  

The original black and blue lace dress which created the internet sensation divided the world about what colour it actually was. 

Some saw it as white and gold, while others saw it as blue and black.

The picture of #TheDress - as it became known - was first posted on Tumblr by Caitlin McNeill, a 21-year-old aspiring singer from Scotland, after noticing her friends saw different colours in the photograph.    

Even celebrities weighed in on the fashion debate, with Kim Kardashian asking her 29.4million Twitter followers to help settle a disagreement between herself and husband Kanye West. 

Actress Mindy Kaling also joined the discussion, writing on Twitter: 'IT'S A BLUE AND BLACK DRESS! ARE YOU F***ING KIDDING ME'.

Her friend and fellow actor BJ Novak replied: 'white and gold.' 

Then recent Oscar winner Julianne Moore jumped in, writing to Novak and Kaling; 'what's the matter with u guys, it's white and gold.' 

To that, Novak replied to Moore; 'Thank you!And congratulations on your Oscar, which Mindy thinks is purple and green.' 

This picture of the dress sparked debate, with viewers disagreeing over the colour

The hashtag #TheDress started trending worldwide on Twitter as the debate when global. There have been more than 1 million tweets mentioning the hashtag.

Taylor Swift wrote: 'I don't understand this odd dress debate and I feel like it's a trick somehow.I'm confused and scared.PS it's OBVIOUSLY BLUE AND BLACK.' 

And Justin Bieber kept his fans happy by telling them that he sees 'blue and black'. 

Some celebrities avoided the issue completely, simply declaring that the dress was ugly. 

Model Chrissy Teigen told her 655,000 Twitter followers: 'F*** the dress it's heinous. While Oscar-winner Jared Leto branded it 'fugly'. 

McNeill said she never expected the picture to spark a star-studded debate, explaining that she just thought her followers on Tumblr would have a 'good reaction'. 

The dress, made by the company Roman Originals, is in fact blue and black striped

Despite the debate, the body-con dress is in fact royal blue with black lace detailing. 

It is made by British clothing company Roman Originals, which offers 'affordable women's clothing and designer ladies fashion.'

There are also white, pink and red options, all with black lace. Speaking on Friday, Ian Johnson, of Roman Originals, said: We were absolutely ecstatic about the reception of our fabulous blue and black dress. 

'We sold out within the first 30 minutes of sale and have since restocked all colours and sizes.'

The dress, in black and blue, is also for sale on Amazon, and Depop, and user comments have been just as amusing. 

'This dress made me lose all of my friends and now I am so lonely,' wrote one.

'Where's the white & gold option!? I KNOW IT EXISTS SOMEWHERE IT HAS TO,' said another. 

And now it does - heading for a wardrobe in the Czech Republic.
