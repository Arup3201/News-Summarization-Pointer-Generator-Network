Scorned spouse: Officials say Adam Garibay murdered the man he discovered was having an affair with his wife

A Texas Border Patrol agent has been arrested on suspicion of killing a man he discovered was having an affair with his wife.

Adam Garibay, 33, of Corpus Christi, discovered the affair online early Thursday, brutally beat and restrained his wife, then drove more than two hours north to murder Keith Martin, officials said.

He then took police on a high speed chase before being run off the road and Tazed into submission.

Mr Garibay’s young son witnessed the distraught man restrain his wife, 28, with duct tape and handcuffs before running to a neighbors for help while he sped off, KSAT reported.

Mr Garibay discovered the Facebook affair and immediately confronted his wife, demanding to know where Mr Martin, 35, lived, police told KSAT.

'They were having an affair. She got caught,’ Medina County Sheriff Randy Brown told the San Antonio Express.

When she resisted, he restrained her with duct tape and handcuffs, forcing her to give them Mr Martin’s Hondo, Texas address, authorities said.

‘He was able to get from her by threat the address of the man,’ Mr Brown told KSAT.

The scorned spouse then drove more than 160 miles north to Mr Martin’s Hondo, Texas home to confront him about the affair.

Mr Martin’s young son ran next door to a neighbor’s for help, saying his mother was hurt, KRISTV reported.

Authorities were made aware of the murder plot when they arrived to free Ms Martin. 

Police told KIII they found her ‘pretty severely beat up… tied up with duct tape around her face, her legs, the tape behind her arms, waist, everywhere.’

It is not clear if Mr Garibay walked in and opened fire, or if there was an altercation before shots were fired, but police have fingered the Border Patrol agent as the main suspect in the killing.

KRISTV reported that members of Mr Martin’s family witnessed his murder.

Police say Mr Martin then led them on a high speed chase for 18 miles before being rammed off the road. He was then shot by deputies with a Taser before finally being taken into custody.

‘They did an outstanding job,’ Mr Brown told the Express, praising the deputies. ‘This guy was still armed.’

It is not clear if Mr Martin was armed with his service weapon or a personal firearm when he was apprehended.

The suspected killer was taken to a local hospital for treatment of unspecified injuries. He will eventually face multiple charges in both Corpus Christi and Medina County.

He is due in Medina County Court Friday morning.
