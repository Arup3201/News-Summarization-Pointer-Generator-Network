If your hair is unkempt, or your beard needs a trim you no longer have to make time to visit a barber.

The Shortcut app is ‘on-demand grooming service’ that lets people order a barber to visit them at home, at work or even when in a hotel room.

It matches users with fully-licensed stylists in their local vicinity, and the service runs from 8am to midnight every day.

Users can select either a haircut, or a haircut and beard trim, and barbers can cut up to four men's hair during each single session.   

Shortcut haircuts start at $75 (£47), but the larger the party, the cheaper the cuts become.

ZipJet is an on-demand laundry service in London that collects washes and delivers clothes within 24 hours.

Prices start at £1.75 per shirt, £12.50 to wash and fold a 13lb (60 kg), and dry cleaning costs £10 for each two-piece suit. 

The app is free to download, and the developers are planning to launch in other regions soon. 

Meanwhile, Hassle.com matches cleaners with homeowners so they can book people to clean their house or flat.  

For example, two haircuts costs $65 (£40) each, three drops it down to $60 (£37) each and it costs $50 (£31) for four haircuts.

A single haircut and beard trim starts at $90 (£56), which is reduced to $80 (£50) for two men, $70 (£43) for three and $60 (£37) for four.

Tips are not included, but are discretionary and the average haircut takes 30 minutes, according to the app’s FAQ page.

Payments are made using the Square portable register and payments can only be made by card, to make sure the correct commission is awarded to the stylist and the app.

Barbers are automatically matched with users based on their location within New York City. 

But special requests can be made by emailing the app’s contact page.

The app is only currently available on iOS and for men living or visiting New York City, but the developers said they are working on extending it to more cities, and more platforms.
