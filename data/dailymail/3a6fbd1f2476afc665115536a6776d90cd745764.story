Marks, who is not a student at the university, allegedly lunged at an officer, striking him and attempting to grab his gun, saying that 'asshole' Gordon Ramsay had possessed him and transformed him into God.

Officers reportedly tried to subdue Marks, but the baton and pepper spray they used on the tall foodie had no effect.

Marks, the runner-up on MasterChef season three in 2012, broke free from officers and began running.

He was finally apprehended by five officers in a resident's backyard and taken to hospital for his injuries.

He's been booked on various charges including resisting arrest and assault. Marks remains in hospital in Chicago where he's being restrained in a bed.

According to TMZ's sources, it doesn't appear as though drugs were involved in Marks' strange outburst.

Marks, a U.S. Army contract specialist, was the runner-up to Christine Ha in the third season of the popular reality cooking show MasterChef last year where he was mentored by Ramsay, Joe Bastianich and Graham Elliot.

The self-taught cook beat out 30,000 hopefuls for a spot on the show and came close to the top spot, losing out to Ha after serving up an undercooked lobster.

Since the show, he's been involved with the Real Men charities in Chicago and has spoken about plans to open his own culinary school.

Hell's kitchen: It's not clear what the relationship between Ramsay and Marks has been after MasterChef, but Marks allegedly referred to the chef as an 'asshole' and claimed to be possessed by him

Before appearing on the show, Marks told the blog Eat Jackson what he thought about Gordon Ramsay:

'He has that intensity that I like… He doesn’t intimidate me; he motivates me harder… His personality is milder on [MasterChef] than on Hell’s Kitchen; but he can get intense.'

Following the first of two eliminations on the show, Ramsay told Marks that he could call him any time and that he would help the young chef with his career.
