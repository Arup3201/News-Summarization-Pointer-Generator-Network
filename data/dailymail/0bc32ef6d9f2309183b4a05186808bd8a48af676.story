A pair of drug dealing brothers have been jailed for more than 13 years after police found £20,000 in cash hidden inside their oven and microwave.

Tanveer Riasat, 32, and Naseeb Riasat, 29, hid thousands of pounds inside electrical appliances at their rented bed-sit in Moseley, Birmingham.

The heroin dealing pair were caught by police after officers spotted Tanveer, who is known as Silver, acting suspiciously in his car on July 1 this year.

During a search of the vehicle police found £1,000 hidden in the glove-box, as well as a set of house keys to the drugs den in the Kings Heath area of the city.

Tanveer was arrested on suspicion of money laundering, but when officers entered the bed-sit they found 100 wraps of cocaine under the sofa and £20,000 in cash hidden in the kitchen appliances.

A court heard Tanveer tried pinning the blame on a drug user he claimed to have given a lift to and said the user 'must have dropped his keys'.

He pointed officers to an address in Moseley, Birmingham, where he said the man who owned them lived.

Officers found even more money hidden in the oven - they also found drugs including cocaine and heroin

Police descrobed the bed-sit as a 'drugs hideout' where they found bags of cocaine, heroin and cash

But his lie backfired when police found his brother Naseeb at the addict's property  - and when they searched his car, officers discovered keys to the same drugs den.

At Birmingham Crown Court on Wednesday Tanveer was jailed for eight years after being found guilty of money laundering and possessing heroin and crack cocaine with intent to supply.

Naseeb admitted the same offences and was sentenced to five years and four months in prison.

Speaking after the case PC Mark Bates, from West Midlands Police, said: 'Tanveer has previous convictions for drug dealing and when officers found £1,000 in cash hidden in his car they suspected it could be linked to drugs.

'Their suspicions were proved right when the keys opened up a drugs hideout with bags of cocaine and heroin plus around 100 wraps prepared for street dealing.

'He pointed police to an address in Anderton Park Road, Moseley, and a man he suggested owned the flat keys - but his plan backfired when police found his brother Naseeb at the house and another set of keys to the drugs flat.

'Naseeb admitted his involvement but Tanveer maintained his innocence even though we found his fingerprints in the bedsit.'

Tanveer was previously jailed for five years in 2007 for supplying Class A drugs, whilst Naseeb has also spent time in prison for drug dealing.

PC Bates, who is part of East Birmingham Police's Organised Crime Team, added: 'People continually tell us how tackling drug dealing in their community is their number one priority - it attracts an undesirable element and associated crime - and no-one should put up with it in their streets.

'If anyone has any concerns around drug dealing then please call us on the 101 number and we'll take action.'
