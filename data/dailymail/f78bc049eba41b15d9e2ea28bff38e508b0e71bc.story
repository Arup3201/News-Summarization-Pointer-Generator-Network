After a night out at a fashion awards event in the Big Apple, tennis duo Caroline Wozniacki and Serena Williams returned to sport on Tuesday evening to watch the New York Knicks take on the Washington Wizards in Madison Square Gardens.

The pair laughed and joked throughout the game but sat on the front row, they were perhaps a little too close to comfort at one point as Williams was pictured grimacing as the ball flew past.

Wozniacki, who is ranked No 9 in the world, ran the New York marathon on Sunday, where colleague and friend Williams joined her to offer moral support.

World No 1 Williams and 24-year-old Wozniacki weren't the only sports stars watching on - Arsenal legend Thierry Henry was also spotted at the game.

The Frenchman took time out having starred for current club New York Red Bulls on Sunday.

The former Gunners hero created both goals as his side defeated D.C United 2-0 in their Major League Soccer Eastern Conference semi-final, first leg game. 

The Knicks, meanwhile, were beaten 98-83 by the Wizards having lead by five points at the half-time interval.
