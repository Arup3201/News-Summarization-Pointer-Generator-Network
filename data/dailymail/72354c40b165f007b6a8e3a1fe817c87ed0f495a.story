This is the moment a woman fell under a moving train and survived.

The Australian woman was captured on CCTV sitting on the platform arguing with a man before hurling herself onto a freight train as it passed.

But losing her balance, she fell through the gap between carriages and lay motionless on the ground as the train, weighing thousands of pounds, ploughed over her.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Dangerous: The woman and man, sitting alone at 11pm, edge towards the moving train in New South Wales

Leap: Footage shows her stop smoking to launch herself onto an open space on the train

Shocking: The woman leaps onto a moving freight train as it rattles through Springwood Station in Australia

It powered through the Springwood Station, in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, at 15-20mph.

The woman and man had been deep in discussion as it began to pass just after 11pm on December 28, 2013.

But suddenly she stands up, walks to the edge and - cigarette in hand - jumps on.

Incredibly, moments after the train had passed, the woman rolls over and stands up.

Lost balance: But as she jumps she loses her footing and tumbles towards the gap in the carriages

Lands: She falls onto the train, with her leg still visible and her friends still looking on calmly

Disappeared: The man visibly gasps as she disappears from sight and the 20kmph train powers on

Bleeding, she stumbles towards the edge and cannot muster the strength to pull herself up to safety.

Later footage, revealed today, shows the woman lying on the platform being treated by paramedics.

Viewers of the video - which has now gone viral - have questioned what the man was doing on the platform.

Officers have blasted the act.

Lucky to be alive: The woman lies motionless on the tracks as the train powers away

Stumble: She heaves herself, bleeding, to the edge but struggles to find the strength to lift herself up

Treated: Later the footage shows her being treated by paramedics. It is believed she received stitches in her head and back but was discharged from hospital the same day

'This girl has probably learned a lesson the hard way, she could have been killed or seriously injured,' Detective Inspector Mick Bostock told 7News.

'It's an offence for someone to touch a passing train or attempt to touch a passing train, so to actually try and jump on a moving goods train is very reckless and i wouldn't recommend it.'

It is believed she had stitches in her head and back before being discharged from hospital the same day.
