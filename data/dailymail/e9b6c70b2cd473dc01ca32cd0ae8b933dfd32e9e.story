The victims of a serial paedophile who carried out a sustained campaign of abuse against them while they lived in his care at a children's home today celebrated as they saw their attacker jailed for life.  

John Allen was found guilty of committing historical sexual abuse against 18 boys and one girl aged between seven and 15 at his residential care home in Wrexham, North Wales. 

The 73-year-old had already spent six years in jail over abuse in the 1970s and avoided prosecution in 2003 over more alleged attacks when legal proceedings collapsed.

In the third dealing with the court, the paedophile was told he must spend at least 11 years behind bars for committing 'grave' offences against children at the Bryn Alyn care home he ran in Wrexham, north Wales. 

Mold Crown Court heard how the man's victims considered him 'untouchable' over decades of sustained abuse as they had no one to report his behaviour to while under his care. 

Today they hugged one another and their families after seeing the sex offender jailed, with one man telling Sky News he felt as though his 'life sentence' had been lifted. 

'The validation of these crimes that happened 41, 42 years ago was more important than the sentence for me,' said Kevin Edwards. 

'When you carry these horrendous crimes against you, you're carrying a sentence yourself far greater than prison. 

'When someone comes along and says "now we believe you," my life sentence has been slightly lifted. 

'This trial will, I hope, send out a message to councils, social services and police forces. We're coming for you, the police are coming for you, you can't hide anymore.

The 73-year-old was taken into a police van to be driven to a cell where he will spend at least 11 years 

'One more victim is too many.' 

Stephen Fong, another of his victims, described Allen as 'a monster'. 

'Hopefully he will die in prison. That is not a very nice thing to say and some people might not want to hear that but that is how I feel,' the 50-year-old added. 

'It's fantastic to know that, after so many years, the ex-boys and ex-girls have come together collectively as one and I believe we have got the verdicts we needed.

'I was not a big fan of this justice system until today. Hopefully we can now put this to bed.' 

Sentencing today Mr Justice Openshaw said there were 'recurring themes' among the reasons why his victims hadn't come forward sooner. 

In 1995, after Allen was jailed for six years over a string of offences against young boys, an inquiry was launched to look at the abuse of children in Gwynedd and Clwyd areas. 

Following its publication in 2000, more complainants came forward with claims they had been abused by the 73-year-old. 

But the case was stunted by a Crown Court judge who reportedly ruled that Allen would not receive a fair trial because of the publicity about his previous convictions. 

In 2012 he was arrested amid fresh allegations and found guilty last week of 33 offences against young boys and one against a girl.   

'Complaints were made with social workers and from time to time with the police but these were never investigated,' said the judge.

'These complaints were dismissed as, literally, incredible. 

'The fact is the boys did not complain because they knew it would pointless to do so and it gave the belief that the defendant was untouchable.'  

Today the paedophile was condemned for his 'grave' offences against children over such a long period of time. 

'There have no doubt been more prolific offenders but seldom can there be so many grave offences committed on so many victims over a long period of time, causing so much anguish and misery,' added Mr Justice Openshaw.

At its height, 120 boys were sent into Allen's care at Bryn Alyn by 14 different local authorities, with many coming from across the country, said the judge. Later, some girls were given accommodation in the home described as a 'highly sexualised atmosphere.'  

Allen denied all offences during the six week trial to the shock of complainants present at the sentencing. 

He was given a discretionary life sentence for seven serious sexual assaults and received concurrent terms of 10 years for 23 indecent assaults. One count of gross indecency with a child brought a sentence of two years. 

He was cleared of two other serious sexual assaults. 

Jon Brown, NSPCC lead for tackling sexual abuse, described the man as one of the most prolific sex offenders of his time. 

'John Allen's reign of terror over a dark period of several decades puts him high up the scale of the most prolific child abusers of recent times and his sentence quite rightly reflects the severity of his despicable crimes.

'Instead of nurturing the vulnerable children in his care he abused his power and subjected them to constant, horrendous sexual attacks. 

'His manipulative and devious behaviour allowed him to hide behind a shroud of respectability while his helpless victims suffered intense emotional trauma. 

'Allen was able to evade justice for so long because he created an atmosphere of terror where no one was able to oppose him and where he effectively silenced his victims.' 

Allen was jailed for six years in 1995 for child sex abuse. In 2003 more charges were dropped against him 

After John Allen was found guilty by a jury of historical sexual offences, it was alleged the 73-year-old had at one point supplied young boys for Westminster 'paedophile parties' alleged to have taken place at Dolphin Square, a luxury complex in central London. 

The apartments have been mentioned on numerous occasions amid allegations of abuse carried out by political heavyweights such as Sir Peter Hayman and Cyril Smith. 

Metropolitan Police are actively investigating claims of historical abuse, while the Home Secretary has ordered an inquiry into whether such atrocities ever happened under the noses of influential politicians. 

Last week Dennis Parry, a former leader of Clwyd County Council claimed Allen played a hand in the alleged ring of paedophilia. 

'My information was that not only was he an abuser, he was a supplier. 

'There was movement between Holland and this country, and Dolphin Square was part of the set-up,' he was reported as saying in the Sunday Times. 

Further inquiries are being made about claims the paedophile transported young boys between Ipswich and north Wales on the whims of other sexual offenders. 

It has been alleged that Allen was not only an abuser but also a supplier and helped transfer boys in his care to Dolphin Square, in central London, which is at the centre of an allegation that MPs used it to abuse boys
