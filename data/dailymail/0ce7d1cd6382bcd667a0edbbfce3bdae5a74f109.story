A toddler who was knocked over by his family dogs as he took them for a walk with his parents has died in hospital.

Police were called to a home in Oberon, west of Sydney, where Joey Woodcock was found unconscious and not breathing.

The three-year-old had suffered head injuries while walking with his mother and stepfather Andrew Woodcock in a park opposite their home at around 1pm on Sunday.

Police and paramedics were called after he collapsed at home and they performed CPR. He was rushed to Children's Hospital, Westmead but died at 9pm on Wednesday.

The NSW homicide squad and a strike force have been established to investigate the child's death.

Chifley Local Area Command Crime Manager Detective Inspector Luke Rankin said police were told the boy had been 'knocked' down and 'struck' on his head as a result of the incident.

Det Inspt Rankin said police were told the boy's injuries were caused after he got tangled in the leads of an alsatian and a husky when the animals became loose, reported the Western Advocate.

'Our prominent line of inquiry is we are trying to establish if the child has injuries consistent with what the parents have told us,' he said.

His mother and step-father have been at the hospital and were questioned on Monday.

A crime scene was set up at the home where forensic police officers examined the inside and outside of the premises as well as an area of the park.
