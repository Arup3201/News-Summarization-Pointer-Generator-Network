A woman accused of mowing down a pedestrian and then reversing back over him and into a kebab shop has blamed the crash on her flips flops.

Navlet Anderson, 50, was aiming for a teenage girl she had an earlier argument with when she careered towards the fast food restaurant in Bristol, a court heard.

However, before crashing through the shop, the jury was told she took out pedestrian Stephen Brothwood.

Carnage: A woman accused of mowing down a pedestrian and then reversing back over him and into a kebab shop has blamed the crash on her flips flops. This is the scene following the crash

It is claimed she then reversed back out - abandoning the car on top of her injured victim.

Mr Brothwood was left with a punctured lung, fractured ribs and legs.

Anderson, of Bristol, denies causing grievous bodily harm with intent during the incident in April.

She also denies an alternative charge of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and a further charge of dangerous driving.

Bristol Crown Court was told Anderson told detectives her flip flops caught on the pedals of her Vauxhall Corsa, causing the crash.

Concerns: The crash resulted in a large presence from the emergency services

She told police: 'When I came back to park my flip flops got caught in the pedals and that caused the accident.'

David Scutt, prosecuting, said: 'The Crownâ€™s case is that she sees the youngster and her mother and drives at them and in so doing takes out Mr Brothwood.

'She hits him and the car continues into the front of the kebab shop, damaging the frontage of the kebab shop.

'We say that, in a rage, she drives that car intentionally and deliberately at people. She hits Mr Brothwood and she injures him very badly.'

The trial continues.
