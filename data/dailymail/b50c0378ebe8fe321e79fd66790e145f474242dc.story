An anonymous Twitter account which enraged parents in Long Island, New York, after it started posting incriminating photos of drunken teenagers in uncompromising positions has been suspended.

The account, @LIPartyStories, had encouraged teens to send in photos taken at house parties which typically consisted of kids misbehaving by drinking alcohol, throwing up, fighting, posing naked or lying passed out.

The parents of Nassau and Suffolk counties were outraged last week when they learned of the account, which quickly amassed more than 25,000 followers.

Incriminating: The Twitter account that has been reposting pictures of Long Island teens underage drinking has been suspended

Wide reach: Teens were taking snaps of themselves and sending them to the account which in turn retweeted the pics to more than 25,000 followers

Not suitable behavior: Many Long Island parents were concerned that the pictures could get in the way of their children getting into college or getting a job

Unsurprisingly, the pictures were not the kind of images that any parent would want to see of their child posted online.

'Kids do stupid things. We've probably all done stupid things, now you've got social media to be able to publish to the world how dumb you are forever,' Port Washington parent Peter Winick had told CBS New York when the account first gained public attention last week.

Images posted to the account ran the gamut from a fairly innocuous shot of two girls shotgunning beers to students stripping for no apparent reason.

Since teens have been underage drinking since the dawn of time, the resulting images are pretty unsurprising. Other posts included several students peeing in unconventional places like a sink or the corner of a dining room.

Drunk stories: Some of the pictures were fairly innocuous, like the girls on the left shotgunning beers, or the picture on the right of two boys showing up to the party with a cheetah statue

Sick: But others were more concerning, like the several shots of high schoolers throwing up. This girl made it into a waste bin - many didn't

When you gotta go, you gotta go: Many of the high-schoolers didn't have the patience to wait for an empty bathroom

When the photographed teens had had too much to drink, they usually ended up either throwing up (sometimes successfully making it to the toilet, and many times not), or passing out.

Those that made the mistake of falling asleep before everyone else, were usually subjected to such pranks as being surrounded by beer bottles or drawn on with a pen.

In addition to concerns about the teens' health, local parents were also concerned that the pictures could come back to haunt their children when they apply for colleges or for jobs.

Tired: When the teens had had too much to drink, they usually passed out before finding a bed

Don't move! This teen is in for a surprise when he awakes from his drunken nap

Shouldn't have gone to sleep: The girl who passed out in this photo had crude images scrawled on her face and arm including the phrase 'This is what friends are for'

Marg Lee works for DEDICATEDD, a nonprofit organization that educates teens about the dangers of drinking and driving.

'Once it’s out in cyberspace there’s no taking it back,' she told CBS. 'If an employer is going to be looking for someone to represent their company you’re not going to want somebody that’s been all over the web.'

Before bowing to pressure to suspend the account, the owner had maintained that all they were doing was giving people 'a good laugh.'

'Listen, we simply made this page for something kids can look at and have a good laugh,' the unknown account owner had previously told the New York Daily News.

'The pictures we post are pictures we are being sent.'
