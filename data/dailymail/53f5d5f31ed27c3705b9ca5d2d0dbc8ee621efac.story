Paramedics were called to a Colorado fish restaurant that accidentally served rum and vodka cocktails to six children aged two to eight.

The cousins all ordered Shark Nibbles from the kids' menu - a sweet blue soft drink that comes with a toy shark.

But it was not until they had all drunk a 'significant amount' 30 minutes later that the waitress rushed back saying they were 'made with the wrong ingredients'.

The two-year-old girl had finished her entire drink.

'Dangerous dose': Six children aged two to eight were allegedly served this vodka, rum, curacao and grenadine cocktail called Shark Bite instead of the blue soft drink they ordered called Shark Nibbles

Apology: The waitress at Joe's Crab Shack in Colorado Springs rushed over 30 minutes later in panic

It transpired the bartender appeared to have mistaken the order for a Shark Bite cocktail, made from Bacardi Limon Rum, Skyy Vodka, blue curacao, and 'a dangerous dose of grenadine'.

When one of the girls started feeling ill, paramedics were called.

All children were checked and later sent home. 

Trista and Omar Montoya, who had brought the children and visiting relatives to the eatery, were horrified.

'The manager told us the drink had been "mislabeled",' Mr Montoya told KKTV. 

'Wrong ingredients': The manager came over to explain the two drinks were 'mislabeled' 

Angry: Trista and Omar Montoya said they were concerned by the mix-up and called paramedics

Joe's Crab Shack has confirmed they are investigating the incident and have yet to confirm exactly how the alcohol got into the drink. 

A statement from the restaurant said: 'We do not condone underage service of any kind. 

'Our guests can rest assured that our processes are continuously examined so that incidents like this are avoided.'

Local police have also confirmed they are investigating.

On Monday, Joe's Crab Shack confirmed an employee had been fired following the incident: 'Joe’s Crab Shack has taken the incident at our Colorado Springs location very seriously and are working with the ABC to prevent a recurrence. 

'We learned through an internal investigation that an employee at the restaurant had not been following procedure; their employment has since been terminated. 

'Additionally, we dispatched a senior management team to retrain all Colorado Springs team members on proper beverage service and standards. We are doing everything we can to ensure that an incident like this does not happen again in the future.'
