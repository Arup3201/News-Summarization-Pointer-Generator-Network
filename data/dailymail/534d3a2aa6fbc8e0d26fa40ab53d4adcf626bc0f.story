The think tank set up by Iain Duncan Smith has dealt a stinging rebuke to the Government’s efforts to tackle family breakdown and strengthen marriage.

The Centre for Social Justice said ministers are not delivering on their promises because of a Coalition ‘tug-of-war’ between the Conservatives and the Lib Dems.

Its annual report card on the Government’s progress in dealing with the drivers of social breakdown highlights a string of policy failures and omissions in its approach to families.

It cites the lack of progress being made in introducing transferable tax allowances and eliminating the ‘couple penalty’ in the welfare system.

The CSJ also castigates the Government for its policies towards charities, in particular its decision to impose a cap on tax relief for charitable giving.

Ministers get four out of ten for their measures to reverse family breakdown but score even worse – two out of ten – for their approach to the voluntary and community sector.

In a foreword, the think tank’s managing director Christian Guy said: ‘There has been commendable political progress in areas such as addiction treatment strategy, education reforms and radical welfare reform.

‘Yet there is much left for the Coalition to do if it is to leave a social legacy in 2015.

‘The Government’s focus on supporting families and charities remains inadequate.

‘A political tug-of-war has once again stifled attempts to tackle the family breakdown that is devastating the poorest parts of our society.

‘And the Government must rethink its dangerous plan to cap tax on charitable donations.

‘It is wrong to brand philanthropists as tax dodgers, as the mishandled arguments of ministers have done recently.

‘It is a proposal which makes less sense as time passes and it should be dropped with haste.'

The CSJ says high-profile events such as the Royal Wedding have not done enough to promote marriage

The CSJ report said ministers had so far failed to implement promises to boost marriage.

‘As leader of the opposition, David Cameron was firm in his resolve to bolster marriage and he is closely associated with the flagship policy of a transferable tax allowance,’ it said.

‘However, the Government has still not capitalised on opportunities to implement this measure. This cannot simply be down to cost.’

And it criticised the fact that Mr Duncan Smith had not laid out plans to tackle the ‘couple penalty’ in the benefits system.

‘A benefits system that disincentivises parents from living together makes it more likely that children will be raised by single parents,’ it said.

The CSJ was set up by Mr Duncan Smith, now Work and Pensions Secretary, when the Tories were in opposition. The report card accuses ministers of repeating the mistakes of the previous Labour government by making childcare and parental leave their chief preoccupations.

It suggests that differences between the Conservative and Lib Dem parts of the Coalition are responsible for a ‘frustrating lack of coherence in tackling the tragic breakdown of family life’.

And it warns that last summer’s riots underline the urgency of dealing with the social challenges facing the country.

The report card says the cap on charitable giving tax relief has damaged morale and demonstrated that some ministers do not appreciate the powerful and unique contribution that non-state agencies can make to tackling the most deep-rooted causes of poverty.

However on other aspects of the broken society the CSJ awards the Government higher marks.

It gets eight out of ten for its welfare reform efforts, seven out of ten for Michael Gove’s academies and free schools, seven out of ten for its emphasis on full recovery from drug addiction, and six out of ten for measures to help people avoid serious levels of debt.

Mr Guy said: ‘The Coalition still has time to lead the radical social reforms necessary to complement economic recovery.

‘It needs to reclaim the governing initiative which characterised its early months in office, and lead the country into a new era in which even the most dysfunctional communities have their chance to play a positive part in society.’
