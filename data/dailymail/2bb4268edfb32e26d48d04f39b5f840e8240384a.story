The Duchess of Cambridge loves her blue M Missoni coat dress so much she wore it to two formal occasions in just a few months.

But it looked as though fans of her style would not be able to follow suit, because the outfit is from the label's Autumn/Winter 2010 collection and thrifty Kate bought it from a discount store.

Now, after the Duchess proved her admiration for the look, M Missoni has announced it will be re-releasing the tweed coat at a limited number of stores next month.

Second chance: Kate's blue tweed M Missoni dress, which she paired with a navy cocktail hat and court shoes, will be on sale at a limited number of stores from next month

It will cost £670 and be available at
the M Missoni flagship store in London, Westfield White City and 
Shepard's Bush as well as Harrods and Harvey Nichols, according to Grazia magazine.

The news is sure to delight eager copy-Kates, and will no doubt trigger a rapid sell-out showing for the Italian designer.

The Kate Effect is well-known for its remarkable marketing power.

When she wore a £310 black velvet 
coat by Libelula to the wedding of her and William’s friends Sarah 
Stourton and Harry Aubrey-Fletcher in January 2011, it sold out in 
hours.

Her famous blue Issa engagement dress
flew out of Harvey Nichols on the day Kate wore it and the £16 
knock-off at Tesco sold out within an hour of going online.

A Temperley Titan dress she wore to a
charity bash sold out in two hours, a Burberry trenchcoat the wore in 
Belfast sold out in a day, and the Reiss bandage dress she chose to meet the Obamas last year flew off the shelves.

The 'Discount Duchess' sourced the 
blue M Missoni coat dress from Bicester Village, one of her favourite second-hand stores.

Thrifty Kate recycled the outfit in Nottingham this week when she attended the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations.

The Duchess of Cambridge freshened up
the look by pairing the dress with a navy cocktail hat by Rachel Trevor
Morgan and navy court shoes in place of her usual nude heels.

She is by now well known for loving the High 
Street and shopping at affordable second-hand stores including The Stock
Exchange near her family's home in Bucklebury, which stocks nearly new designer clothes by Miu Miu, Issa and Gucci.

Kate first wore the blue dress to Fortnum and Mason with the Queen and Camilla in March, with grey stilettos and her hair loose.

The 'recycling' moment was just the latest example of her thrifty style.

Last weekend, she attended the wedding of Prince William's cousin in
an entire outfit made up of pieces she had worn on previous big occasions.

She chose a £795 raw silk Katherine Hooker coat-dress, which she was seen in at last June’s Order of the Garter service.

She teamed it with a £99 Whiteley hat 
with curled trim that she wore to last year’s Epsom Derby, and of 
course, her ever-present £180 LK Bennett nude heels.
