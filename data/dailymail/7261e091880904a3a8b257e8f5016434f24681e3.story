Wales head coach Warren Gatland has warned his players not to be lured into complacency by England's injury crisis ahead of the sides' RBS 6 Nations opener on Friday week.

England's Owen Farrell, Joe Launchbury, Ben Morgan and Manu Tuilagi are all expected to miss the tournament while Brad Barritt, Kyle Eastmond, Geoff Parling and Tom Wood are struggling to make the clash at the Millennium Stadium.

'If you were England you'd be talking about the injuries and trying to talk Wales up,' Gatland said.

'We have to make sure we don't get distracted by that sort of chat, we have to concentrate on ourselves.

'It doesn't matter who they pick. We saw that last summer when they went to New Zealand and pushed the All Blacks really close in that first game.

'They then made a number of changes for that second and third test.'

England beat Wales 29-18 at Twickenham last year but were thrashed 30-3 at the Millennium Stadium in 2013 as the Red Dragon sealed the title.

'It will be a tough game for both of us,' Gatland continued.

'We lost last year at Twickenham in a game we didn't play well in but still could have won.

'And then lot of people still talk about the experience of England losing at the Millennium Stadium two years ago.

'There's a lot of expectation from both teams.

You win that first game, you get a bit of confidence and momentum, and you can go on and win the championship.

'You lose the first one and it's easy enough to go and finish at the other end of the table.'
