The Dowager Countess of Grantham’s contempt for anyone ‘in trade’ clearly isn’t shared by the real-life bosses of Downton Abbey, who are releasing a huge range of products to tap into a £100 million demand for merchandise

Tie-in products as diverse as jewellery, board games, Christmas decorations, wines, playing cards and roses are set to be sold in high street stores.

John Lewis will begin stocking 37 items of Downton Abbey jewellery next week, including silver Edwardian Fleur drop earrings and a gold Belle Epoch scallop collar necklace.

Meanwhile, Marks & Spencer hopes to cash in on Downton’s success with a range of beauty products emblazoned with quotes from the show, such as a soap with the slogan ‘I’d expect no less’ and a lipstick with the line: ‘Now stop talking and kiss me before I get cross.’

Downton’s leading ladies have also inspired a range of fabrics which will be on sale in independent retailers from next month. The burgundy and blue Lady Mary fabric are said to reflect her ‘strength and style’, while those inspired by Lady Edith have an Art Deco design to echo her love of  the unconventional.

Fans can also buy the official Downton Abbey calendar, which is available at WH Smith, and two different jigsaws on sale at John Lewis.

But these items are just the tip of the iceberg because the show’s producers, Carnival Films, have hired marketing firm Metrostar to exploit the Downton Abbey brand with products including tableware, bed linen and silverware.

Spin-offs from the show are proving lucrative in the States, too. The Republic of Tea company has produced a Downton range which includes a ‘ruby red’ English Rose Tea, a ‘traditional’ Downton Estate blend and a ‘full bodied’ Grantham breakfast tea.

American firm Wines That Rock will launch an official Downton wine range next year, while fans can already purchase hybrid roses inspired by characters including Anna the maid.

Also available are a T-shirt emblazoned with the Dowager Countess’s comment ‘What’s a weekend?’ and Christmas tree decorations, including a replica of former chauffeur Branson’s car or Highclere Castle, where the show is filmed.

Meanwhile, the stately home has its own range of gift-shop merchandise, including an iPhone case, shopping bag and salad dressing.

Experts predict the market for Downton Abbey merchandise could be worth £100 million in America alone, which could net £3.5 million for producers.

Carole Postal of Knockout Licensing said: ‘I can’t think of another TV drama series that has generated this level of interest.

'The greatest compliment to the show is the number of retailers wanting to be a part of it.’
