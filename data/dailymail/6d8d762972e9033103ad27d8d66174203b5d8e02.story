Crawling with rats, sticky with mud and vibrating to the sound of guns booming day and night, life in the trenches was both dangerous and unpleasant.

But there were some light-hearted moments as these rare photos reveal, with singers, can-can girls and concerts all laid on in a bid to keep spirits up.

And it wasn't just the army who benefited. One rare 1917 shot shows officers attempting an 'Egyptian dance' during a naval revue on their ship.

But while impromptu performances weren't uncommon, some recruits managed to turn entertaining the men into a full time job.

One such soldier was Leslie Henson, a West End actor and comedian, who was signed up by the Royal Flying Corps in 1917.

But generals, mindful of the morale-boosting impact of concerts and performances, soon pulled him off frontline duties, asking him instead to put together a stage show to entertain the troops.

The resulting performance was known as The Gaieties and included a mixture of slapstick comedy, vaudeville and music house tunes - all of which proved enormously popular with the men serving at the Front.

But Henson wasn't the only West End star to relocate to the Western Front for the later stages of the war.

Joining him on the frontline was Marie Lloyd, an enormously popular comedienne and singer dubbed the 'Queen of the Music Hall' by her legion of fans.

She too spent much of her time in France and Belgium, amusing off-duty soldiers with her repertoire of risqué songs, which included such ditties as Now You've Got Your Khaki On - a huge hit with frontline troops.

Not every act to appear in British army messes had their roots in the music halls, however. Others boasted a far more ancient pedigree, in particular the theatrical touring companies.

Many set up shop in French coastal towns such as Le Havre and Le Touquet, bringing actresses of the calibre of Penelope Wheeler to France to appear in performances of plays by Shakespeare among others.

More performers still came from London's opera houses and concert venues, although for many troops, just getting away from the Front was entertainment enough.

Others, as a simple shot of soldiers and volunteers from the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps waltzing their way around a Le Touquet casino, reveals, just wanted to relax.

For sadly, many, although they didn't know it it at the time, were dancing their last dance as the war that cost the UK a million young lives ground on.

Fame: Marie Lloyd, a singer, was particularly popular with soldiers and made regular frontline appearances

Marie Lloyd was the Queen of Music Hall. She had made her debut as a table singer at the Eagle, but soon she was the naughty phenomenon of the age.

In her distinctive trill she warbled innocent-seeming lyrics with titles like Oh! Mr Porter, What Shall I Do? and She’d Never Had Her Ticket Punched Before that were loaded with double entendres – innocent enough today, but shocking to the Victorians and Edwardians.

When the moralists protested about her song I Sits Among the Cabbages and Peas she amended it to I Sits Among the Cabbages and Leeks – to howls of appreciation from her admirers.

Marie had a colourful private life; she was refused entry to the US at the start of a tour because she had shared a cabin on the voyage over with a man to whom she was not married.

Unlike fellow performer Vesta Tilley, her ending was a sad one – she took to the brandy and fell over drunk on stage.

The audience thought it was part of the act and roared with laughter, but she was mortally ill and died a few days later aged just 52. 100,000 people came to her funeral.
