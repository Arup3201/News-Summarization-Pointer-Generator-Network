Mark Doughty, 39, was fired  after explaining to customers that a staff shortage and broken boiler meant they would not receive their usual service

A train worker was allegedly sacked for telling passengers why they were being served sub-standard food on board and now his colleagues are threatening strike action.

Catering crew leader Mark Doughty, 39, was fired by East Coast trains after explaining to first-class customers on the Edinburgh to London train that a staff shortage and broken boiler meant they would not receive their usual cooked breakfast.

Angry customers, who said they were not getting what they paid for, allegedly took it out on the staff, reducing some to tears.

But afterwards, East Coast management allegedly accused Mr Doughty, an employee for nearly 14 years, of bringing the company into disrepute.

And now members of the RMT Union are being balloted for industrial action demanding his reinstatement.

Mr Doughty, from Edinburgh, said it was known in advance that the 5.48am service on September 29 from Waverley to King's Cross would be one member of staff short.

But then the chef phoned in sick, reducing the catering crew to just four.

The crew then found out via e-mail that the train had a broken boiler, meaning the crew could not serve cooked breakfasts, due to a lack of hot water.

Instead, they handed out warmed-up paninis with bacon or scrambled egg and roast tomatoes - much to the customers' annoyance. 

Mr Doughty said: 'The passengers were not happy. The passenger who complained said the bacon panini was disgraceful - to put it politely. It tasted and looked disgusting.

'They were annoyed because they were not getting what they were paying for. Some took it out on the staff. One member of staff was in tears as a result.

'I explained it would not have made any difference if the chef had turned up because the broken boiler meant we could not serve them the food they would normally get.'

RMT is now claiming that East Coast have used Mr Doughty as 'a scapegoat for continuous equipment failures on board trains'.

They said he had been blamed for the 'inferior catering offer and bad management decisions' which allowed trains to be sent out, despite being short-staffed. 

He told passengers that the full cooked breakfast they would normally get on the early-morning Edinburgh-London train would not be available, for which he was accused of bring the company into disrepute

It said: 'Mark has been dismissed for bringing East Coast trains into disrepute yet there is not one shred of evidence that backs up the company's claim.

'If the charge is true and indeed that serious then why was Mark allowed to work his normal duties throughout September, October, November, and December?'

In a message to its members, the union said: 'The RMT have entered into dispute over the sacking of Mark.

'You will be getting a ballot paper through your door soon please vote "yes" for strike action and action short of strike.'

The passenger who first complained about the poor service was horrified to learn of the sacking.

David Beaumont, a regular East Coast passenger said: 'I find it hard to believe a member of staff can simply be dismissed for telling the truth to insistent passengers like myself in such circumstances.

'The target of my complaint was the people responsible for the chaos, not the guy placed in the awkward position of breaking it to a train load of annoyed passengers, a job that he did incredibly well.

'I am a regular user and recently there has been constant problems with the provision of proper First Class food on this route.'

An East Coast spokesman said: 'This is an internal matter, and there is nothing further for us to add at this time.'
