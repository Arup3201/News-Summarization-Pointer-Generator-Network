Picture of innocence: Victorian and Edwardian children were supposed to be seen and not heard but records how the reality was quite different

The Victorian era was a golden age 
for the middle classes. Industrialists, bankers and clerks were all able
 to send their children to school to the age of 12 or 14.

In
 this age of prosperity and enlightenment they were expected to be 
well-dressed, good-mannered and most importantly - seen and not heard.

But new research carried out at the University of Manchester suggests children were every bit as unruly as they are today.

PhD student Ruth Colton 
examined the history of some of the country's most-used parks in London,
 Yorkshire, Manchester and Newcastle, which were designed to promote 
social harmony but became a magnet for anti-social behaviour.

After
 sifting through postcards, public records, archaeology and children’s 
literature from the period, the Ms Colton found the children weren’t 
always the little angels we might think they were.

She said: 'I don't agree that Victorian and Edwardian children were to be seen and not heard.

'It was supposed to be the golden age 
for middle class children, who 
were depicted as angels or fairies in advertisements and literature.

'But children and children’s play was a prominent feature of parks and 
one which was framed by class.

'Working class children, depicted as street urchins, were given a less 
positive spin, but parks were thought to be a good way to purify and 
improve them.'

Disorder: Whitworth Park in Manchester was one of many opened with the intention of promoting social harmony

She added: 'And like today, there was a rowdy and unpredictable side 
too: while parks were supposed to promote social harmony, this was often
 resisted and parks could be sites of conflict and contrast.

'Newspapers reported that children and youths were sitting on park benches shouting abuse at passers-by.

'Children would also illegally fish in park lakes for ornamental fish or steal fruit of the trees.'

The
 parks Ms Colton studied include Whitworth Park in Manchester, Roundwood Park 
and Vauxhall Park in London, Greenhead Park in Huddersfield and Saltwell
 Park in Gateshead.

Objects
 excavated in Whitworth Park by The University of Manchester led 
Community Archaeology Project, of which Ms Colton is part, showed that 
eating food and drinking alcohol, forbidden in the park bye-laws, took 
place in the park.

The team
 have unearthed marbles from the tops of Codd bottles alongside the more
 expensive coloured glass marbles, showing how children from different 
social classes played and competed together.

Five
 stones – a game similar to jacks - was also found at the Manchester 
Park. Made of ceramic, they are among the earliest examples of toy 
manufacture.

She said: 
'Excavated material showed how parks were one of the few places where 
social classes could mix and compete against each other, particularly 
children.

'I hope that my work will inform our understanding of the parks’ heritage and in doing so will help to inform a vision for their future.

'Children have always had a wild side to their nature;  kids will be kids and this is as true today as it was in the Victorian and Edwardian eras.'
