A New Jersey congressman is under investigation for using campaign funds to cover personal expenses for a luxurious vacation in Scotland for his wife and two daughters.

U.S. Rep. Rob Andrews (D-1st Dist.) splashed out more than $30,000 to attend the wedding of an unnamed donor - an expense that was vetted by his wife who serves as a volunteer compliance officer for the politician.

The House Committee on Ethics ruled in early September there is 'substantial reason to believe' Andrews inappropriately used campaign funds for the family trip and the Committee will extend their investigation to fully review the matter.

In June 2011, Andrews shelled out $7,725 for two rooms at the Balmoral Hotel in Edinburgh for a three night stay.

Additionally, his campaign covered $463 for a wedding gift from Bloomingdale's, $953 to cover incidentals like cabs rides, meals and tips and additional funds to pay for flowers and gifts.

His leadership PAC had also covered the family's business class airfare across the pond, topping $16,575, and an extra $1,800 to cover airline change fees.

But after the embarrassing expenses were reported in the local press last year, Andrews repaid $30,000 to his campaign.

Andrews claimed the expenses were legitimate because the groom, who has not been identified for privacy concerns, was a donor.

And though the donor did minimal volunteer work for the campaign and only donated $250 to the candidate, Andrews said he planned the trip to 'deepen his ties' to the friend of the campaign.

But the federal panel disagreed.

'The facts do not establish that Representative Andrews’ relationship to Witness 1 [the unnamed donor] was of a bona fide campaign of 
political nature that had a clear nexus to any political benefit, 
illustrating that the trip’s purpose was for a family vacation to the 
wedding of a personal friend,' the report, released on August 31, said.

The use of campaign money for the Andrews family trip was approved by his wife, Camille, a lawyer and associate dean at the Rutgers-Camden law school, who is in charge of reviewing legal questions about her husband's political spending.

But critics point to the clear conflict of interest that his wife would have in sanctioning the swanky hotel stay and covering other questionable costs.

'Having your wife as the compliance officer is just asking for trouble, Meredith McGehee, the policy director at the Campaign Legal Center in Washington, told The Philadelphia Inquirer.

'She has a vested interest in the resources and in the benefits that were provided by the campaign as the spouse.'

But
Andrews is standing by the integrity of his wife in the matter, telling
The Inquirer she has 'followed both the letter and spirit of the law in
all respects.'

'In a political world filled with 
complex political and legal issues, it is entirely appropriate for me to
seek additional advice and guidance from a trusted and experienced 
lawyer who also is the person I am closest to in life,' he said.

After the Scottish nuptials, the Andrews clan stuck around Europe for a longer stay.

'We're convinced this is an appropriate expenditure to thank and support someone who has given us a lot of time and effort,' Andrews told The New Jersey Star-Ledger about using campaign money for the Scotland leg of their journey.

'We wouldn't have gone on the Scotland trip but for the fact that this person is an adviser and donor to us,' he added.

But the swanky accommodations for their Edinburgh getaway are not the only expenses that have come under scrutiny.

In June of last year, $10,000 from the congressman's campaign fund was used to cover catering expenses for a party thrown as a joint celebration of Andrews' 20th year in Congress and his daughter's high school graduation.

The shindig, at the family home in Haddon Heights, New Jersey, was attended by 300 guests.

Two separate invitations were sent out.

The first inviting donors and those connected to the congressman and a second version was sent to celebrate the graduation of his daughter, Jacqueline, from the Baldwin School - an exclusive girl's prep school in Philadelphia.

A member of Andrews' staff maintains that the majority of guests were connected to the campaign, saying only 10 per cent of those attending were connected to the high school grad.

And expenses for the politician's other daughter, Josie, have also been called into question.

The girl is an aspiring actress and singer and she frequently accompanies her father to Los Angeles, where he travels for fundraising events.

These campaign events conveniently coincide with her acting auditions and recording sessions and according to the Twitter account for the 17-year-old, her home city is listed as Los Angeles.

According to campaign filings, an investigation found that the congressman spent $97,000 on at least 18 trips to California from 2007 to 2011.

'She has come with me on trips to California to do some of her business, but she’s always part of my business as well,' the father said about covering costs for Josie in Hollywood. 

In addition to the Congressional investigation into his spending, Andrews faces a Federal Election Commission complaint that has been filed by the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.

'While the inquiry undoubtedly will drag on for months,' Melanie Sloan, the executive director of the nonprofit watchdog, said, 'it's hard to fathom a scenario in which Rep. Andrews walks away from this unscathed.'
