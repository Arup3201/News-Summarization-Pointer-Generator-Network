High street giant Marks & Spencer today announced it will be rolling out more price cuts across its stores to attract customers after weak homewares sales over Christmas.

Like-for-like sales excluding VAT on general merchandise for last 13 weeks of 2011 were down 1.8 per cent on the previous year.

M&S: Homeware sales were down for the last 13 weeks of 2011 while food sales shot up

The decline in general merchandise sales
follows a 13.3 per cent drop in the home division across all stores 
after the company pulled technology products from its shelves.

But M&S, which has more than 700 store in the UK, saw food sales shoot up three per cent for the same period.

The City forecast a 1.5 per cent decline for general merchandise and 1.5 per cent increase for the company's food division.

M&S, which gathered all of last year's X Factor's contestants for its Christmas advertising campaign, said it would invest in promotions and sacrifice profit margins to boost trade.

Video games retailer Game recorded a 12.9 per 
cent decline in like-for-like sales in the eight weeks to January 7.

This followed a difficult year for the chain, which saw a 10 per cent drop in sales over the course in the 49 weeks up to January 7.

Game, which has 610 stores in the UK and Ireland, saw its share value plunge more than 24 per cent after it announced its sales figures.

Despite the weak performance, Game still outperformed the overall games 
market, which was down 13.1 per cent for the 49-week period.

The group, which has 1,300 stores worldwide trading under the Game and 
Gamestation brands, said that given difficult market conditions it will 
not meet a banking covenant - a promise made to creditors to secure a 
loan - when it is tested at the end of February.

Game chief executive Ian Shepherd said: 'Our industry had an incredibly tough 2011, and so did we.

'We are adapting to the changing market and are well-prepared for the next hardware cycle.'

The company is hoping that the launch of two new handheld consoles this 
year - the PlayStation Vita and Nintendo Wii U - will boost sales in 
2012 after a dry patch for new hardware.

Game will close 39 stores this 
year and the company is on track to have gone from 610 to 550 stores in the UK by 
2013.

The company has become renowned for its big budget TV adverts - hiring high-profile actors, singers and sportsmen for its campaigns.

Another campaign last summer featured high-profile Hollywood stars, Green Lantern actor, Ryan Reynolds and Transformers actress Rosie Huntington-Whitely

But M&S said its expectations for full-year profit remain unchanged despite the impact its decision to invest in promotions will have on gross margins as the company plans to offset this with additional savings and 'tight management' of costs.

M&S chief executive Marc Bolland said the company had 'performed well in a challenging trading environment'.

The group reported a 1.1 per cent increase in clothing sales across all-stores, reported its biggest ever quarter for childrenswear, as well as strong sales of menswear and sleepwear.

M&S said food sales benefited from an increased range of products as the company introduced 600 new lines.

The company's website also saw sales increase 22.4 per cent, which was boosted by a move to extend the next-day delivery deadline and the launch of its Christmas Food to Order service online, which contributed to a 12 per cent increase in orders.

Total group sales, which include 300 international stores, increased 2.4 per cent excluding VAT, driven by continued growth in India and China, as well as good start to its newly opened flagship store in Paris.

But there was no update on the progress 
of the group's £600 million revamp of it stores which it hopes will make
its outlets easier to shop in and boost sales of its own brands.

But Matthew McEachran, analyst at Singer Capital, said overall today's update met market expectations.

He said: 'Although not yet evident, 
management are making progress on the new strategy, and we soon expect 
to see some benefits flow through to sales and profit from enhancement 
to the stores, the brand segmentation, and the navigation.'

A surge in sales in the final week before Christmas helped department store chain Debenhams weather tough autumn trading today.

The
company, which has 170 stores in the UK, Ireland and Denmark, said 
warmer weather throughout October and November impacted sales until a 
record Christmas week left trading for the 18 weeks to January 7 level 
on a year ago.

Shares jumped 8 per cent after investors expressed relief at 
the trading performance, which compared with some forecasts for a 
decline of up to 2 per cent.

Debenhams rolled out drastic discounts across its stores of up to 40 per cent in a 
week-long promotion in November to try and boost its festive season sales.

The strategy paid off after Debenhams said like-for-like sales including VAT improved by 6.5 per cent in the five weeks to December 31.

Chief
executive Michael Sharp said he was pleased with the performance: "We 
traded well despite the difficult environment as evidenced by strong 
sales in December, including record sales in the week before Christmas."

Much of the growth came from the internet after online trade jumped by 35% in the 18 weeks to January 7.

Elsewhere, department store Debenhams 
said like-for-like sales excluding VAT in the 18 weeks to January 7 were
flat as unseasonably warm weather in October and November hit sales and
uncertainty in the wider economy affected consumer confidence.

But the company, with 170 stores in the UK, Ireland and Denmark, said a last minute surge in sales in the final week before Christmas helped the department store chain weather the tough autumn trading and left trading for the 18 weeks to January 7 level on a year ago.

Meanwhile, video games retailer Game warned today that it is set to breach a banking agreement after a dismal Christmas recorded a 12.9 per cent decline in like-for-like sales in the eight weeks to January 7.

This topped off a difficult year for the chain after a 10 per cent drop in the 49 weeks to January 7,

Game, which has 610 stores in the UK and Ireland, saw its share value plunge more than 24 per cent following today's update.

Game's strategic review will see 60 stores closed by 2013 as the company hopes the launch of two new handheld consoles this year - the PlayStation Vita
and Nintendo Wii U - will boost sales in 2012.

Singer Capital analyst, Mark Photiades, said he expects consensus forecasts for full year pre-tax losses to increase from around £12 million to £25 million to £30 million, compared with a £37 million pre-tax profit the previous year.

He said: 'Rumours of a new console cycle offer a glimmer of hope but at this stage it is just speculation.'
