A woman who lost part of her leg in the Boston Marathon bombing abruptly walked off the set Friday during an interview for the NBC News program 'Meet the Press' after the names of the bombing suspects were mention, even though network officials allegedly told her they would not be spoken.

Dancer Adrianne Haslet-Davis was invited to appear on 'Meet the Press,' which airs on Sunday mornings, as part of a roundtable discussion to mark the one-year of the horrific event, which happened on April 15, 2013.

Before she appeared on the program, Haslet-Davis says she was assured by the show's producers that Dzokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev's, the names of the bombing suspects, not be spoken.

She then went on Twitter to vent about the experience.

'I feel so disrespected @meetthepress I asked politely yesterday and you said yes. Now you choose to use the name instead,' Haslet-Davis wrote.

Cannot believe @meetthepress chose to use the bombers name instead of respecting their guest. Had to walk off set crying,' read another tweet.

She later posted an open letter on her website about the experience.

'I did specifically ask of two things for this interview, one being that 
his name (and you know to whom I refer to) not be mentioned in my 
presence,' Haslet-Davis wrote. 'Your decision to back out on that promise you made and the 
horrific way you brought that decision to my attention just minutes 
prior to taping was not only a cowardice move but a dishonorable one as 
well.

To say that I am hurt is an understatement,' she added.

Haslet-Davis said that the other request that was not honored was to be referred to as a survivor, not a victim.

NBC News responded to Haslet-Davis' tweets and letter with a statement Friday evening.

'Adrianne Haslet-Davis is an inspiring survivor with an important story to share. She was due to take part in a roundtable discussion for Meet the Press with three other participants. She requested that the alleged bombers’ names not be used in the entire program, but given the nature of the discussion we couldn’t make that guarantee. We regret any distress caused by this miscommunication.'

Haslet-Davis has made a strong recovery since the bombing which resulted in her leg beign amputated mid-calf. Last month, she performed a dance using a bionic leg.
