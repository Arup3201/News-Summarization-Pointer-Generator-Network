Ecuador striker Enner Valencia is undergoing a medical at West Ham ahead of a £12million move from Pachuca.

The 25-year-old scored all three of Ecuador’s World Cup goals, attracting the attention of a number of Barclays Premier League suitors in the process.

It now appears that West Ham have won the race to sign Valencia - who will become manager Sam Allardyce’s fifth summer signing if the deal is completed following Monday’s medical.

Although any fee is likely to remain undisclosed - Pachuca chairman Jesus Martinez has insisted Valencia will not be allowed to leave the club for anything less than a Mexican league record.

'There are 
various offers for Enner Valencia, the strongest and closest to what the
 player and us are demanding is from a club from England,' Martinez told Ecuagol.

'I
 won’t talk about prices, but if he is sold, it will be the highest 
transfer fee ever in Mexican football football, otherwise he won’t be 
sold.

'We are seeking the 
possibility that is convenient for him and the club and that he is sold 
for the price that we like. We want to keep a percentage of the player 
in case he is sold in the future to another big team in Europe.

'It
 hurts me, I don’t want to sell him and neither does the manager or the 
fans but we can’t go against the career the kid aspires to.'

Busy: West Ham boss Sam Allardyce has already brought in four players this summer

Allardyce
 will be hoping that if Valencia is brought in he can prove stiff 
competition with Carroll for the main striker’s berth in his side.

England
 international Carroll missed a large part of last season with a 
troublesome foot injury and the Hammers struggled to score goals in his 
absence.

But, with Argentina
 forward Mauro Zarate one of four players already acquired by West Ham 
this summer, their options in attack will be much-improved when their 
season kicks off at home to Tottenham.
