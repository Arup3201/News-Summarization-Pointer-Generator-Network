A man who grew mammoth five-foot long dreadlocks over nearly two decades has raised hundreds of pounds for charity by cutting them off.

Gareth Robinson from Bournemouth, Dorset, was 16 when he first had his hair twisted and backcombed into the matted coils after struggling to find a style that he liked.

He stuck with the do for 19 years until the knee-length locks were so long he often sat on them by accident.

Liberated: Before Mr Robinson lost his locks his girlfriend would hold them clear for him to wash his scalp

His girlfriend, 22-year-old Jana Brizdalova, even had to hold the dreadlocks out of the way while he washed his face.

But after having dreads for all of his adult life, Mr Robinson, now 35, took the hair-raising decision to part with them to raise money for charity.

He snipped off some of the front locks by himself with a pair of scissors while Jana tackled the back section of the dreads.

He then then visited a hair salon for the first time since he was a teenager and had it professionally styled.

Through sponsorship he has raised £500 for cancer research, a cause close to his heart after seeing his mother Lin battle breast and ovarian cancer.

'Jana did shed a tear': Mr Robinson said that his girlfriend was more apprehensive than him about the change

Mr Robinson, a medical screener for the Bournemouth air ambulance, said: 'The dreadlocks weighed about 3lbs and it does feel different.

'My hair has been this way since I was 16 so I am still getting used to it. It all started because I was at that age and I couldn’t find any other hairstyle that seemed to suit me.

'At first they were a couple of inches long, and I didn’t expect I would be growing them to almost 5ft years later, but they are pretty much maintenance free.

'When I was younger I put all manner of things on them after following advice from my friends such as wax, egg whites and beer.

'In more recent years it was easier to manage, although washing it could be a two-person affair.

'My partner Jana had to hold it out of the way while I washed my scalp, otherwise they could take three days to dry.

'I decided to get them cut off because I wanted to do something to help raise some funds for a worthy cause and I chose cancer research because my mum has overcome it.

'She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2003 and ovarian cancer in 2006 but received the all clear two years ago.

'When we were cutting them off I felt quite liberated but Jana did shed a tear, she was more apprehensive about the whole thing than me.'
