England striker Andy Carroll has resumed training with West Ham United, according to co-owner David Gold.

The club's £15million record signing has endured a rotten string of injuries at Upton Park and suffered ankle ligament damage during a pre-season tour to New Zealand in July.

Carroll, a former Newcastle United and Liverpool striker, underwent surgery in America to repair the ligaments and was expected to be out until at least December.

But Gold confirmed that the 25-year-old had returned to training with the Hammers, while also revealing that no date has yet been pencilled for the forward's return.

The Hammers co-owner tweeted: 'It has been confirmed that striker Andy Carroll has resumed training, but there is no time-scale on his possible return. dg.'
