The Archbishop of Adelaide has been charged with covering up child sex abuse.

It is alleged Philip Wilson tried to hide abuse carried out by another priest in the 1970s, The Australian reported.

Wilson was appointed archbishop for the South Australian capital in 2011.

Philip Wilson has been charged with covering up child sex abuse carried out by a priest in the 1970s 

The charge comes after it was revealed the senior figure in the Catholic Church did not report priest Jim Fletcher who was accused of paedophilia while they were working in the Maitland region, north of Sydney in New South Wales.

Fletcher ended up serving prison time from 1989 to 1991 after he was convicted of raping a 13-year-old boy.

Five years later, the convicted paedophile died.

A Special Commission of Inquiry conducted last year handed down that Fletcher 'had an extensive history of perpetrating child sexual abuse in the diocese, exclusively abusing young males, particularly altar boys'.

It is thought Wilson is the most senior Catholic official in the world to face charges of this nature (pictured above is St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican)

Wilson is thought to be the most senior Catholic official in the world to face charges of this nature and if sentenced, could face up to two years behind bars, News Corp reported.

NSW police said a 64-year-old man was charged after allegedly concealing 'a serious offence regarding child sexual abuse' in the Hunter region.

The charge is the result of an investigation by Strike Force Lantle, which since 2010 has probed allegations of concealment of child abuse by former and current clergy attached to the Maitland-Newcastle Diocese of the Catholic Church.

Police said a future court attendance notice related to the matter was served in South Australia on Tuesday.

It comes as the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse continues in Sydney. Ian Paterson, the former headmaster of Sydney's Knox Grammar School, gave evidence

A former Roseville College student, Lucy Perry, accused Dr Paterson of touching her on the buttocks, which he denies

The matter is listed for Newcastle Local Court on April 30.  

This charge comes as the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sex Abuse continues in Sydney.

Explosive claims have been made during the hearing, including allegations of extensive abuse carried out at Knox Grammar School on Sydney's North Shore.

Dr Ian Paterson, the school's headmaster from 1969 to 1998, admitted to impeding a police investigation into allegations of paedophilia from teachers while he was giving evidence earlier this month.

While a former Roseville College student, Lucy Perry, told the inquiry about an incident where she claims Dr Paterson touched her on the buttocks during a joint rehearsal of a musical with Knox.

But the former headmaster has vehemently denied the allegation, saying he 'absolutely not' touch Ms Perry in 1989 when she was 15.
