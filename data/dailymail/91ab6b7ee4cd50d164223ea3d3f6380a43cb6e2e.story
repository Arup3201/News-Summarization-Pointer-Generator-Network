An Englishman scoring a hat-trick in the Champions League is a rare phenomenon. 

Only Wayne Rooney (September 2004 v Fenerbahce) and Michael Owen (December 2009 v Wolfsburg) have managed it in the past 10 years.  

Arsenal's Danny Welbeck celebrates completing his hat-trick on Wednesday night

Danny Welbeck joined Mike Newell, Andy Cole (with two), Alan Shearer, Owen (twice) and Rooney in the European hat-trick club. 

Newell scored the fastest-ever hat-trick in the Champions League, netting his three goals in a spell of only nine minutes for Blackburn against Rosenborg in 1995.

Cole scored his first hat-trick for Manchester United against Feyenoord in 1997 and his second against Anderlecht in 2000.

Shearer claimed his treble for Newcastle against Bayer Leverkusen in 2003.

Bizarre sights at the Emirates with Galatasaray keeper Fernando Muslera acting as chief fire officer, extinguishing the flurry of flares thrown onto the pitch by his own fans. 

It took Wesley Sneijder and Muslera to calm down the Galatasaray fans, who had been angered when one of their number was ejected by police.

It took a while before a steward arrived with a sand bucket to finish the operation. 

Beware the latest fashion in holding midfielders — they’re not always the answer. 

It’s only a few years since Felipe Melo was being touted as the answer to Arsene Wenger’s problems in that area. 

Felipo Melo was fortunate only to receive a yellow card for wild challenge on Alexis

That’s the same Felipe Melo who was brushed aside by Danny Welbeck for the second goal, who was lucky to stay on for his tackle on Alexis and who was at the heart of the shambolic defensive performance.

The official attendance was 59,803, Arsenal past masters in the ‘tickets sold’ method of calculating home crowds.

But there were plenty of empty seats for Arsenal’s opening home Champions League fixture, even if not quite as many as at Manchester City’s Etihad Stadium on Tuesday night.

As Gunners boss Arsene Wenger said in the build-up to the game, the group stages of the Champions League aren’t quite the sell they once were.

Galatasaray players must have been grateful for the fact that Graeme Souness was confined to the TV studio and not managing following their awful defending.

Quite what Souness would have made of their first half performance can only be imagined. 

The former Galatasaray manager of course was famous for marching onto the pitch after a cup win at Istanbul rivals Fenerbahce and planting a flag in the centre circle.
