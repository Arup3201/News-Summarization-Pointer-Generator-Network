A high school junior in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio is the newest Guinness World Record holder for most back handsprings.

16-year-old Marie Klein, a cheerleader at Walsh Jesuit High School, beat the previous record of 36 set last year.

Marie told Fox 8 that she found out about the record from another teammate who encouraged her to beat it.

Setting new records: 16-year-old high school junior Marie Klein beat the world record for most back handsprings last month

Record-holder: Marie has been cheerleading since she was 10. She decided to go after the world record when one of her teammates suggested it  

So last December Marie started training to beat the record, completing 20 back handsprings at every basketball game, across the length of the court.

During the summer she pushed for more, practicing in her backyard and marking her spots on the high school football field.

On September 6, before Walsh Jesuit's sold-out game against St Vincent-St Mary high school, Marie took to the field for her chance to break the record.

The crowd cheered Marie on as she performed 40 straight back handsprings, going more than half the field to the opposing 35-yard line for a total of 65 yards of back handsprings.

She did it! Marie completed 40 back handsprings - traveling all the way to the opposite 35-yard line

While initial reports said Marie completed 42 back handsprings, the video shows she completed 40.

A Guinness World Record official was on site to verify the record, and says that Marie did indeed beat the prior record of 36.

Marie has been cheerleading since she was 10-years-old, and is now setting her sights on beating her record.

'It was crazy,' Klein told the Akron Beacon Journal. 'I loved the way the crowd reacted. My mom was crying. It didn't feel real at times as I did it. I almost passed out, but I kept going. I am real excited to have the record. Now I want to break my own record.'

Challenging herself: Marie's next goal is to beat her own record
