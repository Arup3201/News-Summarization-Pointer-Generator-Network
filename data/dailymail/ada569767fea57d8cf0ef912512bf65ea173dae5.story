A ‘hero’ son who helped rescue his parents from a staged car crash shot them dead four months later to inherit almost £250,000, a court heard yesterday.

Stephen Seddon had an ‘insatiable thirst for cash’ and blasted his parents with a sawn-off shotgun after learning he was the sole beneficiary of their will, it was alleged.

The married father-of-three had previously attempted to murder Robert, 68, and 65-year-old Patricia by driving a car into a canal with them strapped in the back seats, it was said.

The couple were rescued by the fire brigade and their 46-year-old son was nominated for a bravery award.

But the court heard they ‘had to die’ and he later shot them both.

The jury was told ‘ungrateful’ Seddon
killed his ‘quiet, unassuming’ parents despite them giving him £40,000 
and  buying him a home in the months leading up to their deaths.

Manchester Crown Court was told that after the shootings the defendant 
planted the gun in his father’s lap to make it look like a 
murder-suicide.

Seddon denies two counts of murder and two of attempted murder.

Instead of using his own car, Seddon hired the BMW and drove from his home in the North East to Manchester on the pretext of treating his parents to a surprise meal, a belated Mother's Day present the court heard

The 46-year-old father-of-three had debts and an insatiable need for cash, Manchester Crown Court was told

The couple made a will in October 2009, naming each other as beneficiary if one of them died, with their assets valued at £356,000 and, after liabilities, an estate worth £230,000

Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, described how Seddon set out to ‘execute’ his parents and then cover his tracks.

He said: ‘They had each been shot at close range with a sawn-off shotgun.

‘In the immediate aftermath of these 
executions, the killer had taken steps to make it look as if the person 
responsible was in fact, Robert Seddon.

‘The person responsible not only wanted rid of Robert and Patricia Seddon – he wanted to lay a false trail.

‘A trail he hoped would lead away rather than towards a man with a considerable motive to kill these two people.

‘That man was their son, the defendant, Stephen Seddon.’

The jury heard Seddon first attempted to kill his parents by faking a car accident last March.

Despite the elderly and caring couple gifting their son £40,000 in cash and buying his home to keep a roof over his head, his parents 'had to die' because he stood to inherit everything in their wills, it is alleged

He shot them both at close range - then planted the gun in his father's lap to make it look like a murder-suicide at the family home in Sale, Greater Manchester, the court was told

He was at the wheel of a hired BMW 
when it plunged into a canal as he took his parents and severely 
disabled nephew Daniel, 17, to a surprise Mother’s Day meal.

He was on a ‘short cut’ to the 
restaurant alongside the Bridgewater Canal in Timperley, Manchester, 
when the car veered off the road.

His nephew managed to free himself 
and Seddon was seen on the roof of the car, trying to kick the windows 
in and shouting for help.

However he went on to give ‘many and varied’ accounts of what had happened.

Seddon had been out of work since October 2011 and by March the following year was under financial pressure

He told a police officer at the scene
he had suffered a heart attack and blacked out. But hospital tests 
indicated he had no heart problem.

Seddon also suggested the car had hit
a brick, but no debris could be found and experts thought it would be 
‘highly improbable’ for that to be the cause of the crash.

Mr Wright described Seddon as ‘doubly
fortunate’ to be carrying a lock knife and crook-lock he used to cut 
his seatbelt and break the windows.

Following the incident Seddon, from Seaham, County Durham, was put forward for a bravery award.
Mr Wright said: ‘Mr Seddon was portrayed as a hero and he was happy to 
perpetuate this myth. The accolades…did little to alleviate his 
financial problems.

‘He needed to resort to more severe 
methods to bring about their deaths, which were not a terrible tragedy 
but rather a double murder at the hands of an ungrateful son.’ The jury 
heard Mr and Mrs Seddon lived a ‘modest but comfortable’ life in Sale, 
Greater Manchester. They were sole carers for their grandson, Daniel, 
after their daughter Lesley, 40 died in 2008.

Their will named each other as 
beneficiary, with an estate worth £230,000. But the court heard that if 
both died, Seddon ‘got the lot’.

‘That’s why they both had to die,’ Mr Wright added.

Seddon, who lived with his wife Nicola and three children, had been out of work since October 2011.
Mr Wright continued: ‘He had money problems and an insatiable thirst for
cash. He was the sole beneficiary of their will but, in order to 
inherit, he needed them both dead.’

The trial continues.
