A female teacher found guilty of having sex with a 12-year-old student has been sentenced to 38 years in prison today.

Married mother Ethel Anderson, 31, was told she was a 'parents' worst nightmare,' on Monday as she was jailed in Tampa, Florida.

Judge Chet Tharpe told Anderson in court that she manipulated the boy's parents into believing he was safe and groomed the child for sex.

Anderson was charged with nine counts of molesting a student after it was discovered that she was having sex with a boy who was 12-years-old at the time.

Tears streamed down Anderson's face as she was sentenced, but Judge Thorpe, right, showed little sympathy as he accused her of grooming the child

Anderson had denied the charges but her victim, now 14, took the stand in September to testify that the alleged abuse 
started four or five weeks into their tutoring sessions when she would 
kiss him and perform oral sex on him in her home.

He told the court: 'I felt like she was a girlfriend, I loved her and she said that I was her boyfriend and she loved me.

'She would rub on my legs, kiss on my ears, neck and stuff like that... We would tongue kiss.'

The former 'teacher of the year', from Riverside, Florida, who has a six-year-old child, told the judge today she is not a sexual predator and not a risk to society according to Fox.

But the boy's mother showed no signs of forgiveness.

'Anger and hatred don't even begin to explain how I feel about what you took from my son,' the boy's mother said in a statement read at the sentencing by prosecutors. 

'His innocence is lost forever.'

Anderson wept in court as she claimed that she was not a threat to society and was not a predator - but her victim's mother and the judge disagreed

Anderson, who worked as a language arts 
teacher at Mango Elementary School, cried as she listened to the teen's 
testimony earlier this year and denied the charges when she took the stand.

When confronted about the 230 pages of racy text messages she said they were just sexual therapy that she was using on the 'troubled student' to motivate him.

She told the court: 'At the time, with him struggling with school and having behavioral issues and anger issues, acting out at home and not being able to connect with his family, the way that he and his parents felt, that was my purpose.

'To gain his attention and, yes, I did it in an inappropriate way.'

The mother claimed the boy would threaten her, telling her things like, 'keep playing you're gonna lose your child'.

The boy also told the court that he did not want to lose his virginity to a teacher and would tell her to stop, but she persisted because she 'wanted him so bad', ABC reports.

The parents of the young boy were suspicious of their son's close relationship to the Anderson and tipped off police.

Wearing a wire, the boy's mother later confronted Anderson, when she admitted having oral sex with him. The tape was played to the jury.

In her testimony, Anderson testified she only admitted to sex acts in the secretly-recorded confession by the boy's mother, only because that is what she thought the mother wanted to hear.

The 30-year-old turned down a 15-year prison deal followed by 15 years of probation and a jury decided her fate.

The boy has since transferred schools.
