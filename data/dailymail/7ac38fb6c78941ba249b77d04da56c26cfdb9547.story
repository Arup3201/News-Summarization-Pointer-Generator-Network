A Miami-based designer and illustrator has reimagined major fashion campaigns by replacing the featured supermodels with real-life 'super women' - including Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, actress and LGBT activist Laverne Coz and feminist icon Gloria Steinem.

Elisa Rodríguez-Vila was inspired to edit these powerful women into popular fashion ads after seeing Celine's latest campaign starring 80-year-old literary icon Joan Didion.

'The crazy idea of casting women who don’t fit the supermodel mold - yet are super heroes in real life - is actually not that crazy at all,' she wrote in an essay for Fusion. 'Choosing these women wouldn’t be a risk, it would be a sure-fire hit.'

Bright idea: Ms Rodríguez-Vila put Orange Is The New Black star and LGBT advocate Laverne Cox into this colorful Versace ad

Ms Rodríguez-Vila referred to the industry's repeated use of the same models and celebrities as 'a fashion Groundhog Day'.

With that in mind, she took it upon herself to create her own 'dream castings', which included Mrs Bader Ginsburg for Chanel, Miss Cox for Versace and Ms Steinem for Chloé.

She also envisioned writer Roxane Gay for Saint Laurent, Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai for Louis Vuitton, Little League star Mo’Ne Davis for Céline and transgender rights activist Janet Mock for Calvin Klein.

'I enjoy flipping through fashion magazines just as much as the next person, but I didn't fully realize how bored I had become with fashion ads until I saw the Joan Didion Celine ad,' she told HuffPost Style in an email.

Ms Rodríguez-Vila added: 'This was a woman who was beautiful and stylish, but those characteristics were just footnotes to the amazing life she has led. It got me thinking how easy it would be to recreate that feeling with in fashion ads.'

She explained that she has nothing against professional models, like Gisele Bundchen and Cara Delevingne, who dominate the industry, nor does she think they are 'completely void of intellect or live totally un-interesting lives'.

Breaking boundaries: Ms Rodríguez-Vila thought transgender rights activist Janet Mock would make a beautiful underwear model 

She said the project was simply about adding more diversity. 

'Women who are older, or who don't fit into the traditional standards of beauty and gender can make amazing models, and shouldn't be excluded,' she said. 

But Ms Rodríguez-Vila's vision already seems to be catching on in 2015.

Last month, New York-based jeweler Alexis Bittar paired 93-year-old interior designer and fashion icon Iris Apfel with 18-year-old Rookie magazine editor Tavi Gevinson for his label's new spring/summer 2015 campaign. 

And earlier this week, Mrs Apfel was revealed as the new face of Kate Spade's spring 2015 collection along with 22-year-old Karlie Kloss.
