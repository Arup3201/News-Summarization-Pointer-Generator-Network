England were condemned to a series defeat despite a stirring late fight-back, as the All Blacks ran riot after half-time at the Forsyth Barr Stadium to re-assert their global supremacy.

Stuart Lancaster’s national team had taken a 10-0 lead early in this second Test and once again showed a commitment to attack the world champions with pace and ambition. But having led going into the break, the visitors were simply blown away after half-time, as New Zealand scored three tries in a devastating 22-minute spell to set up the victory which means they are 2-0 up in the series ahead of next Saturday’s final Test in Hamilton.

This was the All Blacks’ 16th consecutive Test victory and if they are successful next weekend, they will equal the world record set by their predecessors in the Sixties and matched by South Africa in the 1997-98. Yet, this result also served as a reminder that the Kiwis will not be easily knocked from their perch at next year’s World Cup.

Over and out: Julian Savea scores a try to increase New Zealand's lead against England

Catch me if you can: Ben Smith scored a try for New Zealand against England

There
 was considerable English optimism going into this match, on the back of
 their heartening performance at Eden Park in the first Test. But 
ultimately, Lancaster’s side were given a stark illustration that their 
quest to re-emerge as a global force remains a work in progress. When 
the All Blacks really found their rhythm here, England simply couldn’t 
stem the tide. Their defence unravelled and they lost all structure and 
shape.

Yet, a late rally 
which brought tries for Mike Brown and Chris Ashton highlighted the 
spirit in the squad and a refusal to succumb to a heavy defeat. The 
efforts in the closing stages not only made the final scoreline mighty 
close, it suggested that England still have it in them to seize a 
consolation victory next weekend.

After
 all the local jibes about England’s stalling tactics, the visitors 
delivered a stirring retort by storming into this match with high-tempo 
endeavour. They were soon building pressure in the New Zealand half and 
took the lead in the third minute with a penalty by Owen Farrell, before
 surging clear moments later.

In
 the series opener seven days earlier, England had secured a 100 per 
cent return from their lineout, but that record was spoiled in the sixth
 minute here when the All Blacks stole a Rob Webber throw. Yet, their 
poaching effort didn’t work out well.

Aaron
 Smith’s attempted clearance kick was charged down by Joe Launchbury, 
the Wasps lock picked up on the left and sent an off-load in-field to 
the charging Tom Wood. He in turn released Webber and the hooker drove 
at the line, but was held up inches short and from a subsequent ruck, 
the hosts stole possession and cleared to touch.

Regroup: England learnt a lot about themselves during the rollercoaster ride against New Zealand

No
 matter. England claimed their next lineout and after a brief drive by 
the pack, Danny Care picked out Marland Yarde on an inside line and the 
wing crashed through Richie McCaw’s tackle and through Aaron Cruden, 
before stetching to touch down. Farrell converted and Lancaster’s men 
had roared into a 10-point lead in the space of eight minutes.

Stung
 into life, back came the All Blacks. Ben Smith broke past Luther 
Burrell’s attempted tackle to ignite an attack and Ma’a Nonu twisted 
past Joe Marler to keep the move alive, but England’s defence scrambled 
well to hold out.

Despite 
the perfect conditions under the stadium roof, the kickers had their 
lapses. First, Cruden missed a penalty shot and then Farrell was 
off-target from long-range at the other end.

From
 that point, the game became disjointed and loose – fast and dramatic 
but lacking real incision in the danger areas. England continued to work
 the ball from side to side, but without making good use of their 
powerful ball-carriers to generate momentum, they were unable to 
generate sufficient momentum to further unlock the Kiwi defence.

Just
 before half-time, out of nowhere, the visitors should have scored a 
second try. A sustained New Zealand raid faltered when Cory Jane knocked
 on, Tuilagi picked up and roared away down the right, into enemy 
territory. He made it as far as the home 22 before being hauled down by 
Ben Smith, who managed to win the ball on the floor against Brown and 
the danger was averted.

There
 was just enough time for the home side to earn another penalty, which 
Cruden kicked to make it 10-6 to England at half-time. After the break, 
it was as if a switch was flicked as the All Blacks went into over-drive
 to seize the initiative.

Running man: Billy Twelvetrees of England skips past Ma'a Nonu during the first-half

In the book: Owen Farrell, centre, is shown the yellow card by referee Jaco Peyper

In
 the 43rd minute, England were on the charge but an off-load by Billy 
Twelvetrees went loose and Brodie Retallick snatched the ball, which was
 transferred across to the left. Cruden ran clear through a gap and 
released Savea, who drew Brown and passed back inside for Ben Smith to 
burst into space and around to the posts.

Cruden
 converted and after another Farrell penalty briefly levelled the 
scores, the onslaught continued. Ben Smith took a high kick to instigate
 another wave of Kiwi pressure and Aaron Smith darted away down the 
blind side, before being stopped in his tracks by Farrell in the England
 22. It only delayed the inevitable though as a long pass left reached 
Nonu, he off-loaded to Kaino and the No 8 sent Savea away to score in 
the corner.

A previously 
balanced contest was turning into a mis-match as Conrad Smith broke into
 the visitors’ 22 with men outside, but his pass flew into touch. But 
there was no containing the world champions as Beauden Barrett kicked a 
penalty after Farrell was sin-binned for killing the ball at a ruck as 
England desperately tried to repel another assault.

The
 All Blacks then further capitalised on their numerical advantage with 
another try. Cory Jane’s pass sent Conrad Smith into the 22 again and 
when he picked out Nonu on the flank, the centre stepped inside and back
 out to score in the corner. Barrett converted and the game was well and
 truly up.

Or so it seemed… 
Once England were back up to their full 15-man strength, their pride and
 defiance kicked in as they stormed forward in search of a try to revive
 the contest. It duly came eight minutes from full-time when Billy 
Twelvetrees released Brown and the full back touched down despite a 
combined effort by Aaron Smith and Jane to hold the ball up.

Farrell
 converted and England weren’t finished. The last play of the match saw 
Yarde and Wood open up space for Tuilagi on the right and he passed out 
to Brown, who charged down the flank and sent the ball back inside for 
Chris Ashton to go over unopposed. Farrell’s conversion ensured that the
 All Black’s winning margin was a mere point. So near, but so far – once
 again.
