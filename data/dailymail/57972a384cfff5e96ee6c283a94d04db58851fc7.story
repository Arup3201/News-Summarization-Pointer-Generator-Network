Chris Froome’s defence of his Tour de France title became much more difficult on Tuesday when he fell heavily and injured his right wrist and left side early on stage four.

It was an innocuous-looking crash but the consequences could be devastating before today’s fifth stage over the pave roads of north-eastern France. Froome tumbled after a touch of wheels when he was close to the front.

Although he was quickly back on his bike he paused for medical treatment before rejoining the peloton. He had his wrist strapped and, at the finish, did not go through his usual warming-down  ritual.

Painful: Froome injured his wrist after falling and he will be tested on the cobbles of the fifth stage

Instead, 
Froome was taken to hospital in Lille for an X-ray, although Sky 
principal Sir Dave Brailsford insisted this was a precaution.

‘Chris
 is all right,’ said Brailsford. ‘He felt fine in the final, good 
physically, but we are going to send him for a precautionary X-ray to 
check his wrist. He landed on his hand and wrist.

‘We’d
 have preferred it if Chris hadn’t crashed but he felt fine in the final
 bit. His spirit is fine. We know it’s part of the rough and tumble of 
pro bike racing.’

The
 stage continued the domination of the big German sprinter Marcel 
Kittel, though this was by far the toughest of his three stage wins 
after successes in Harrogate and London. Having lost his sprint train he
 had to improvise but when  Norway’s Alexander Kristoff took a flier 
Kittel was more than a length adrift.

On
 the line, Kittel won by centimetres as Kristoff thumped his handlebars 
in frustration. Kristoff could also face legal action after suggesting 
in the Norwegian media that Britain’s Mark Cavendish crashed 
deliberately in Harrogate.

For
 Froome, the timing of his crash could hardly have been worse. 
Wednesday’s stage has been the most talked about in the build-up to the 
Tour. The nine pave sections are bone-jarring at the best of times and 
positively excruciating when a rider is nursing a wrist injury.

These
 are the roads that characterise the toughest one-day race on the 
cycling calendar, Paris-Roubaix. Known as the Hell of the North, it is 
renowned for the cobbled roads that are no longer in  general use but 
are preserved, in their decrepit state, for the classic race.

The cobbles last featured in 2010, when one of the favourites, Frank Schleck, crashed and broke a collarbone.

Six
 years before that, a crash on the  pave ended the hopes of the Basque 
climber Iban Mayo. This year’s cobbled sections are the most severe in 
years, and a controversial inclusion.

With
 rain forecast, Froome’s priority will be to remain in contention 
on a day when at least one favourite is expected to lose his chance of 
winning the event.
