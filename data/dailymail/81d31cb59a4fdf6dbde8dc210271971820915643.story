Last week, for the first time in 15 years, I didn’t go out for my daily run. As a veteran of more than 50 marathons and a 100-mile Himalayan trail race, it takes a lot to stop me.

But instead of taking in the trees, lawns and ponds of London’s Hyde Park – the one thing that keeps me sane – I was lying in a hospital bed, the victim of a dog attack that was as vicious as it was wholly unprovoked.

It nearly took off my leg and left me with scars, skin grafts and serious questions about the way we allow dogs and their owners to menace others – as well as growing doubts about the way our public parks are managed and policed.

'I screamed for help': Jeff Prestridge back at the scene of the 'vicious' and 'unprovoked' attack in Hyde Park

Don’t get me wrong: dogs, properly managed, are truly wonderful companions. I’d even go so far as to say I’m a dog-lover.

Normally I pay no attention, not even to the professional walkers pulled along by packs of three, four or five animals at once – dogs that presumably belong to owners too busy to actually look after them themselves.

So when, last week, I went for a short, sharp run in Hyde Park, family pets were among the last things on my mind.

I’ve come to love this magnificent Royal park, with its eclectic mix of tourists, Lycra-clad cyclists, parakeets and runners of all shapes and sizes. And I have also come to love the Serpentine, in which I’ve occasionally swum on a crisp winter morning.

For 15 years I’ve run through the park without incident, bar the time I foolishly ran into a bin and sliced open the top of my thigh. A dozen stitches taught me a lesson. But bins are to be expected in Hyde Park – Australian cattle dogs are not. They are bred for one purpose: to ‘nip’ the heels of cattle being herded across the Outback and so keep them in order. Hence the breed’s other name – the Australian heeler.

Film lovers may remember the character ‘Dog’ from Mad Max 2 – Max Rockatansky’s canine companion following the loss of his family. Well, ‘Dog’ was an Aussie cattle dog.

I never saw this one coming.

I was gliding past the Peter Pan statue and in sight of the Princess Diana Memorial Fountain when the dog homed in on my right leg like a heat-seeking missile. My first reaction was to hurl abuse at the two walkers in ‘control’ of the half a dozen dogs from which this Exocet had emerged.

Powerful: The Australian cattle dog is bred to herd and 'nip' the legs of cattle

But when I looked down at my foot, all I could see was blood pumping from the wound and a flap of skin the size of a mini pizza dangling from just above my ankle.

This dog, squat with the shoulders of a weightlifter, had not just ‘nipped’ but savaged my leg before sauntering off, its mission presumably accomplished.

One of the dog walkers ran away, taking his motley crew of mutts with him. No doubt he did not have a licence for professional dog-walking, as is required in Royal parks. The other walker, God bless him, stayed. Everything then became a blur.

I remember screaming for help. A runner stopped to offer me comfort and used his top as a tourniquet on my leg while a park employee looked on in disbelief.

A wonderful elderly gentleman called the police and two friendly constables came to the rescue. They looked after me until an ambulance crew arrived to whisk me away – after 30 minutes of form-filling – to St Mary’s Hospital, Paddington.

After a night in hospital, copious quantities of morphine, countless blood-pressure tests and heart-rate checks, I was wheeled into theatre for a skin graft from my left thigh.

The dangling skin couldn’t be saved. However, I’m told I should make a full recovery, provided that the antibiotics do their job.

I can’t thank enough the medical staff who took care of me, nor the police who retrieved my clothes from the gym and my keys from work. They even visited me after my operation.

My beef is elsewhere. It’s quite obvious that when I run again – and I will run again, come hell or high water – I’m going to be nervous when I see a dog walker coming my way, let alone if I spot an Australian cattle dog.

Why do people keep dangerous dogs like this muscular vampire cooped up in a cheek-by-jowl city like London? Is it insecurity? Machismo? Or, more justifiably, as a deterrent to burglars (the owner, an Aussie, is an art dealer and lives in swanky Kensington)?

This dog is bred to herd by aggression. It should be on the other side of the globe at this very moment chasing cattle, not in London mauling a sub-standard runner. Imagine how much worse things could have turned out had the victim been a child.

Secondly, given its fearsome reputation and heel-nipping DNA, why wasn’t the dog on a lead in an area where all dogs are required to be so?

And given the ferocity of the breed, shouldn’t it at the very least have been muzzled? Under the Dangerous Dogs Act, the blame falls squarely on the shoulders of the dog walker (or in this case, as I have since discovered, the ‘dog trainer’ who was walking it).

Touch wood, he will be prosecuted for not being in control of the dog, but the owner and the animal itself will in all likelihood escape any kind of sanction.

Mr Prestridge's damaged leg was left needing a skin graft

The owner has since removed the dog to the countryside, and agreed to have it both muzzled and on a lead when it is taken out, but that’s probably as far as it will go.

Maybe he will receive a summons when the case against the trainer goes to court, but it’s not a given. He says that the dog has never attacked before but, given that it has been receiving ‘training’, I don’t believe him. The dog has behavioural problems.

It is unlikely to be destroyed. The Australian cattle dog is not listed as a dangerous breed under the Act. And as a dog-lover, I’m not keen to see it put down.

But finally, and most worryingly, the whole episode highlights a worrying deterioration in the policing of our Royal parks.

The dog was not seized because most kennel facilities at police stations have been closed due to budget cuts.

Against the rules, the dog was not on a lead, presumably because the walker thought he could get away with it. Policing is light-touch.

And the walker who fled had obviously walked dogs there many times before without being required to show a licence. I very much doubt that he had ever been asked to produce one.

London’s eight Royal parks are patrolled by the Metropolitan Police. But the pressure to cut police budgets continues, which is all rather worrying when you consider the millions of people who visit these sites every year.

If we are not careful, London’s scantily policed Royal parks could become magnets for criminals and thugs – and it won’t just be runners who are the victims of violence.
