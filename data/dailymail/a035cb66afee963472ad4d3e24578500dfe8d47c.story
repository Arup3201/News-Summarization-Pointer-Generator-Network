A Russian motorist was left stunned after he found a cat stuck in the most unusual place - his jeep's suspension spring.

Vitaliy Bouranin, 32, said that he hadn't noticed anything when he'd climbed into his Toyota Land Cruiser to set off on a business trip in Sakhalin, Russia.

But after travelling for 50 miles at speeds of over 80mph he decided to stop at a petrol station to fill up.

Stuck in a rut: The cat had managed to get himself in a tight spot but mechanics still tried to free him

Tightly wound: This little cat looks unmoved by all of the attention he is receiving to free him from the suspension spring in Russia

Helping hand: One man shoves his hand right into the spring in an attempt to push the cat out

He said: 'As I was filling up, I heard a noise that sounded like a cat meowing. I thought it might be under the car so when I put the fuel nozzle back I looked under the car and couldn't see it, but I could still hear it.

'After a little poking around I finally saw a patch of fur and realised the cat somehow ended up inside the spring.

'I have no idea how long it was there, or far more importantly, no idea how it got there. I would have said it was impossible for a cat to get in the middle of a spring like that but somehow it had managed it.'

You're free: The cat appears to have a stretch as he is released from the spring after being stuck in a cramped position for a very long time

Nine lives: This cat had a lucky escape after being driven 50 miles unnoticed

He quickly asked an attendant for help, but he couldn't get the cat out.

Staff then called the police and fire service who eventually decided the only thing to do was dismantle the car and remove the suspension spring.

Surprisingly, the cat stayed calm throughout the three-hour ordeal to free him.

He was then put into a box so he could be taken back to the large Russian island in the North Pacific Ocean in southeast Russia where his epic journey had begun.

Safe and sound: Mechanics are still trying to work out how the animal ended up getting wedged inside the spring after a three-hour operation to free it
