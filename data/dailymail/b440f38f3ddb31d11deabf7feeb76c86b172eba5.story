This is the moment a burglary suspect falls nine storeys after attempting to zip line off a building in western Russia.

Nikita Dragarov was allegedly trying to flee the scene of a burglary and found himself on the roof of an apartment block in Zelenogorsk, near St. Petersburg.

The 43-year-old can be seen looping a towel over the telephone wire and start sliding off the roof when he loses his grip.

Escape: Burglary suspect Nikita Dragarov, 43, can be seen looping a towel around a telephonewire on the roof of the nine storey block before attempting to slide down

The shocking footage shows Dragarov 
trying to slide down to another block just five floors high using the 
wire and the towel as a makeshift zipwire.

The
 film sees Dragarov wrapping the towel around his wrists and edging 
backwards towards the 100ft drop, below before taking off.

‘He
 managed to move a few metres on the wire and then suddenly he seemed to
 lose his grip and the towel opened up,’ said one shocked witness.

‘He
 just fell until he hit the ground still clutching the towel. It was 
horrible,’ neighbour Natella Aksakova, who filmed the horrific fall, 
said.

‘We watched on helplessly as the man smashed to the ground with a thump,' she added.

‘He was up to no good up there, but nobody deserves to die in such a horrible way.’

Police
 say Dragarov - who died instantly from the impact of the fall - was a 
career criminal and was trying to flee a crime scene when he fell.

‘Prosecutors
 were already preparing a further criminal case against him so he had 
good cause to be willing to try desperate measures to flee,’ said a 
police spokesman.
