As the celebrity stroller brand of choice, new Bugaboo designs never fail to make waves on the yummy mummy scene.

But its latest offering, which rings in at an eye-watering $1,775 (£1,250), is strictly for the babies of high-rollers.

Named 'My First Car', the new stroller is the result of a collaboration between Bugaboo and fashion label Viktor & Rolf, and is inspired by the fixtures of a luxury vehicle.

Indeed, it is so luxurious, its price tag exceeds that of Bugaboo's Donkey double buggy which sparked unprecedented demand when it launched last year. 

The design, based on the popular Cameleon3 model, comes in dad-friendly grey, and is made from a 'sports car-style fabric'.

It boasts a leather-look canopy (with rear window to keep an eye on the lucky little-one) and a matching leather-look wheel skin, which is hand-stitched to the handle bar and a carry handle.

The stroller has rear silver alloy wheels featuring the Viktor & Rolf emblem, while the footmuff and rear of the carrycot both bear a license plate, with the script, 'bb-♥-VR'.

Viktor & Rolf designers Viktor 
Horsting and Rolf Snoeren said in a press release: 'Working on this 
collaboration was a creative challenge as it’s out of our immediate 
design sphere, which always proves to be interesting as you can think 
about objects differently.

In doing so, we envisioned a My First
Car Bugaboo – a luxurious and innovative vehicle that is the ultimate 
in mobility design. There is a slightly ironic and unexpected twist as 
this Bugaboo takes to the open road – but we love the idea of any design
object being transformative.'

Bugaboo's Chief Marketing Officer Madeleen Klaasen said she was thrilled with the results of the collaboration.

'We
are 
extremely proud of the result of our collaboration,' she said. 'With My 
First Car, Viktor & Rolf has added ingenuity and originality to the 
modern
lifestyle and mobility of parents today.

'We love how they both 
literally and figuratively turn what’s expected upside down. That creative imagination complements our products and our brand perfectly.'

Viktor & Rolf is the latest fashion label to collaborate with Bugaboo, following in the footsteps of Missoni, Marc Jacobs and Paul Frank.

The Missoni partnership was especially successful, winning countless celebrity fans including Kate Hudson and Rachel Zoe.

Parents keen to get their hands on the My First Car stroller before the rest of the yummy mummy set should sign up to Gilt, where the stroller has gone on sale to members today. For those prepared to wait, it will go on sale at selected stores and at Bugaboo.com from next month.
