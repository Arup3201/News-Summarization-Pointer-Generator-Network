If they could do it all over again, Americans say they'd pick businessman Mitt Romney to run the country over President Barack Obama, a new survey finds.

Romney would take 53 percent of the popular vote to Obama's 44 percent and beat Obama in almost every demographic group if the 2012 election were held today, according to a CNN/ORC International poll released yesterday.

Men, women, white voters and voters aged 35 and older would all vote to replace Obama with Romney, the poll discovered, while only young and non-white voters would stick by the besieged president.

The former Massachusetts Governor would lose handily to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, however, in a similar match-up.

Redder on the other side: If the 2012 election were held today, Americans would elect businessman Mitt Romney instead of President Barack Obama

In a 2012 rematch, Romney would win with 53 percent of the vote to Obama's 44 percent. He would also best Obama in nearly every demographic group

In an election against Clinton, a presumed 2016 presidential candidate, Romney would lose by 13 points, the poll found.

Clinton's numbers were buoyed up in the poll by women voters, who said they prefer the former first lady to Romney by a margin of two to one, and non-white voters. Nearly eight in 10 non-white voters said they'd vote for Clinton over Romney, highlighting the GOP's ongoing struggle to attract minorities to the party.

Poll-takers also found that Hillary Clinton would blow potential Democratic competitors out of the water in 2016 if she decides to run, beating the next closest hypothetical candidate, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, by 57 points.

A resounding 67 percent of Democrats selected Clinton as their first choice in 2016, while a mere 10 percent went with Warren.

The two women were the only Democratic candidates polled who received double-digit support from members of their political party.

Vice President Joe Biden, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley were favored by less than 10 percent of self-identified Democrats who took the poll, receiving support from eight percent, four percent and two percent of respondents. Another six percent of Democrats said they'd prefer someone else entirely.

Hillary Clinton's overall popularity has slid since beginning her worldwide Hard Choices book tour, however.

Roughly the same percentage of respondents to the poll said they consider Clinton a 'strong and decisive leader' - 63 percent now compared to 64 percent in early-March - but noticeably fewer gave her positive marks in other areas.

Asked in March whether Clinton shares their values, 56 percent of survey-takers said yes. Only 51 percent say the same thing now.

Clinton is also perceived by less Americans as caring about the needs of people like them now - 53 percent - than she was before - 56 percent.

The shift in public opinion of Clinton's sympathies could be attributed to a slew of new stories on her wealth in the wake of a comment last month that she and her husband Bill were 'dead broke' when they left the White House. A majority of Americans making less than $50,000 a year, 57 percent, continue to say Clinton cares about them, however.

President Barack Obama is also viewed more negatively across the board than he was in March. Then, 50 percent of poll-takers described the second-term president as 'strong and decisive.' Now, just 48 percent attribute those qualities to him.

They are also less likely to think he can manage the government effectively, shares their values and cares about people like them.

Romney wouldn't fare so well against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, however. Clinton would take 55 percent of the vote in a hypothetical match-up against Romney and win win every demographic group but white voters

When it comes to Republicans' presidential prospects, CNN/ORC found it's still anyone's game in 2016.

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie jumped to the top of Republican voters' 2016 wish lists, garnering 13 percent of survey-takers' support.

Christie, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Fox News host Mike Huckabee were close behind at 12 percent each. Texas Governor Rick Perry and 2012 Vice Presidential nominee Paul Ryan tied for third place with 11 percent of Republicans' support.

Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum were in the back of the pack. The five men were chosen in that order by: eight percent, Bush and Cruz; six percent; five percent and three percent of perspective Republican voters.

Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal and Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann are also considered potential 2016 candidates, but they were not included in the CNN/ORC poll. Bachmann, a 2012 candidate, did not indicate her interest in running again until after the poll was taken.
