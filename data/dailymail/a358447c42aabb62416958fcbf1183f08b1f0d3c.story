A Pennsylvania man on a business trip to the Bahamas was stabbed to death outside his resort Friday, local law enforcement officials announced.

The body of Carl Yerger, 45, from Fleetwood, was discovered in the town of Bimini on the western side of the archipelago early Friday morning.

According to the victim's wife, Rebecca Snyder Yerger, her husband was a co-owner of Custom Milling and Consulting.

The father of two young sons, ages 7 and 10, was also a president of the Oley Valley Youth Sports League for just over a year. 

According to the Royal Bahamas Police Force, Mr Yerger was found dead from multiple stab wounds at around 7am outside the Big Game Resort and Marina, where he was staying for the duration of the business trip, NBC 10 reported. 

Investigators say they have taken in four suspects for questioning, but no charges have been filed so far.

Police believe that the fatal stabbing may have been a random act of violence.

Bahamas Press reported
 that Mr Yerger may have been familiar with his killer, and that the 
stabbing could be related to a large-scale drug sting that took place in
 the vicinity of the resort just hours after Yerger was found dead.

The
 paper reported that the son of the island's mail boat captain was 
arrested by Bimini police, who also seized 500lbs of illegal drugs.

In a statement released on the Oley Valley Youth League website, Mr Yerger was described as a  'forward thinking, intelligent and thoughtful' leader who volunteered countless hours to the program.

‘He was unique, caring, ambitious, detailed, organized, courageous, a problem solver, and mediator,’ the tribute read. ‘He was patient and a great man that led with his words and more importantly with his actions. He led with class and a smile.’

The youth sports league, a non-profit organization that offers coaching in baseball, softball, basketball, field hockey and soccer, has suspended all its games this weekend in light of Yerger's tragic death, according to WFMZ.
