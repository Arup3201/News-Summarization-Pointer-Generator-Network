The parents of a five-year-old boy were found dead inside the family home at Upper Coomera on the Gold Coast just after 5.30pm on Wednesday

The 39-year-old woman and 43-year-old man were found dead inside this suburban Gold Coast home. Police say the house will remain a crime scene for at least a week 

The little boy was found wandering the family home on Skylark Street just after 5.30pm on Wednesday by his aunt who located the two bodies. He may have been inside the house for an entire day before the gruesome discovery.  

Police believe the victims, Renee Carter, 39, and her partner Corey Croft, 43, were stabbed to death in the home at around 8pm on Tuesday evening. 

Ms Carter's ex-husband, Christopher Robert Carter, 36, has been charged with murdering the pair.

He is a member of the Australian Defence Force and has served on at least one tour of Afghanistan.

Carter initially worked as an instructor at the army barracks on the Gold Coast before taking up a stint at the barracks in Townsville.

He briefly appeared at Southport Magistrates Court on Thursday but didn't speak or show any emotion.

Carter and the mother of the five-year-old boy have been divorced for seven years.

Regional crime co-ordinator Detective Superintendent David Hutchinson said a knife was used in the double murder of Ms Carter and Mr Croft and that the woman's sister found the pair when she visited the house after being unable to make contact.

Police believe the boy was asleep at the time and are confident he did not witness the deaths. He did however spend the following day in the home with his parents' bodies. 

Detective searched another premises for possible bloodied clothing and a public toilet block near the accused's home. 

They have appealed for anyone who saw a white 1999 model Mitsubishi Pajero four-wheel drive in the area over the last week to come forward.

Following the gruesome discovery, the boy was consoled by a detective outside his home  dressed in a blue forensic suit believed to be used when someone may have evidence on their body, the Gold Coast Bulletin reports.  

Supt. Hutchinson said the boy was not involved in the fatal incident and was unharmed. He is being cared for by relatives after speaking with police.

'You would understand that a five-year-old child being inside the house under those circumstances would have to be very traumatic,' Supt Hutchinson said.

'You've just got to hope at the end of the day that he's young enough to minimise the impact on him.' 

A 36-year-old man has been charged with two counts of murder after the bodies of a man and woman were found at property in Upper Coomera on the Gold Coast just after 5.30pm on Wednesday

It's believed the family signed a lease on the home six months ago.

Tony Smales, another neighbour, told the Gold Coast Bulletin the household was the most family-orientated on the street.

'They had the entire place lit up for Christmas with giant Santas and reindeer, so it just blows you away to see something like this happen,' he said.
