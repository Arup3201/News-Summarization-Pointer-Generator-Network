What started out as a man with a passion for photographing the sea, has now become the entire world for an early-rising and seriously skilled photographer from Bondi.

In 1999 Eugene Tan begun to wake that little bit earlier before his commute into the city to his full-time design job, and took the time to capture the sunrise.

Every morning since then Uge, as he's known to nearly 45,000 Aquabumps subscribers, has photographed the first light of the day over Sydney's iconic Bondi Beach.

Aquabumps began more than 15 years ago, when Eugene Tan decided to photograph the sunrise over Bondi Beach every morning

Uge specialises in underwater photography, and what begun as a hobby has become his entire business

Another of his trademarks is aerial shots, sometimes taken from a remote operated helicopter

Aquabumps has taken Uge and his family around the world to shoot in Hawaii, Fiji, Indonesia and Italy

Since 1999 Uge has sent a daily email with shots of the sunrise over Bondi Beach to subscribers

'I believe in the niche. My niche is underwater and aerial shots of Australian beaches, I started doing aerials about five years ago,' Uge told the Daily Mail Australia.

'I'm looking for interesting light, a lot of action, bright colours. Anything distinctive.'

And distinctive is exactly what Uge's pics are, showing stunning serene waters in some images, while others showcase tumultuous swell and surfers taking on huge barrels and breaks.

Most portray incredible light patterns, some are perfectly formed waves against a bright backdrop, while the underwater shots reveal the full power of the sea from a whole new perspective.

Intricate and interesting light patterns are prevalent in many of the Aquabump photographs

Almost 45,000 people now subscribe to the emails, which arrive in inboxes around the world each weekday

Uge photographs all sorts of swimmers and surfers good and bad and tried to capture what happens down the beach in the early morning

Aerials are a big part of his portfolio, which he started shooting five years ago

Though the images usually feature bright colours, black and white photographs sometimes make an appearance

Before the immediacy of social media and the  infinite blogs which flood the online world, Uge was a pioneer of sorts, sending a daily email to friends and family featuring his favourite shot of the morning, giving people that little escape as they sat in their cubicles or at their desks.

'Basically I just emailed 20 friends, then 50, then 1000 and it just grew,' Uge told the Daily Mail Australia. 'In the 90s daily pictures of the beach weren't as prevalent.'

Just one year after Google's inception, Uge turned his passion for photographing the ocean into Aquabumps, a website which now has fans and clients all around the world and a permanent art gallery in Bondi.

'We sell online. I can't remember anyone selling photography online when we started.'

Crystal clear waters and perfectly formed waves make up much of the Aquabumps archives

The photographs often feature one or more subjects, and aren't exclusively of the sea itself

The crowded shores of Bondi are also a big feature in the Aquabumps images

Serene beach scenes perfectly composed and captured are another identifying factor in Uge's shots

The gallery is just back from Bondi Beach and Uge insists he wants people to feel comfortable and spend time in the place

He describes his site as somewhat 'under the radar' despite boasting 104,781 Facebook likes and a further 47,552 followers on Instagram. And that's in addition to the 44,125 website subscribers.

'The ultimate compliment for me is for someone to say "I think that's one of Aquabumps' shots", in a time when there's just a sea of photography and we're bombarded with mediocre pictures. There's a lot of noise.'

Aquabumps has collaborated and partnered with some of the biggest brands in Australia and the world, including Speedo, Havaianas, Audi, Cannon and Corona just to name a few.

One of his photographs was featured as a print on Havianas thongs last summer, and the shoe was the biggest selling design after plain black. 'Everyone was really surprised by how well that did,' Uge admitted.

Still waters and spectacular sunrises are often seen in the daily Aquabumps emails

Skilled surfers are a favourite subject for Eugene to shoot, as he loves being out in the waves himself

The Bondi beach lover has only missed two morning shoots, the days his two sons were born

Aquabumps has collaborated with huge surf brands such as Speedo swimwear and Havianas thongs

The shots give a different perspective to the sea through Uge's lens

Despite this, the photographer maintains 'we're really fussy about who we do collaborations with, we get a lot of offers from huge brands.' He also urges that he wouldn't have enjoyed the same successes if he wasn't so devoted to the work.

'You just have to it with passion, I started something I was so passionate about, and did it for free in my spare time for the first five years. It's so important when you start with something you love.'

Aquabumps takes the Tan family all around the world every single year, and Uge has surfed swells and photographed waves in Hawaii, Italy, the Mediterranean, Indonesia, and New Zealand.

'You name it, I've done it,' he said. 'Helicopters in the Kimberleys, over the Great Barrier Reef... We (along with his wife and two young boys) spend a month every year in Hawaii.'

The images show the Australian beach culture quite literally in a unique light

Beaches in New Zealand, the Mediterranean  and America also make appearances in the collection

Uge and his wife Debbie recently travelled to London and New York to investigate the overseas market who are also purchasing the prints

Photographs with lots of action and movement in them are preferable for the photographer

The early morning shoots are a ritual for Uge, who says he feels like his routine is interrupted if he doesn't get out in the water

Uge said it's 'very rare' for him to ever miss a morning in the surf at Bondi, and described his early alarms as a 'ritual.'

'The days my sons were born I wasn't down... It has to be extreme circumstances.'

On an overseas trip earlier this year Uge and wife Debbie spent time in New York and London, trying to scope out the market, as they ship prints to both cities every week.

'We were trying to figure out how people find out about us,' he said, and added that they have plans in the works to get some of the brand there, and looked at the possibility of adding galleries overseas.

There is something distinctive about the style of the Aquabumps photographs

Swimmers of all sorts have made appearances in the stunning series of snapshots of the sea

Simplicity is sometimes king in the serene images

Light and colour plays a big role in the composition of Aquabumps photographs

The thing all the images have in common is Uge's clear passion for what he does and his love of the ocean

For now though, the home of Aquabumps is at a stunning location just back from Bondi Beach, and Uge said insisted 'it's not like a regular shop.'

'I want people to feel comfortable for a while, I want people to come for an hour or two. It's all free, you subscribe free.'

Aquabumps' roots are firmly planted in the beachside community, and Uge credits that, in part, to its great success.
