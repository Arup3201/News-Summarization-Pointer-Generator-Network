Ex-Chief Whip today denied giving Nadine Dorries permission to abandon her constituents for a month to take part in I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here.

The MP for Mid-Bedfordshire triggered a storm of outrage when she jetted off to the jungle for a month when she should have been in Westminster.

Instead of taking part in Commons debates and helping her constituents she has been seen eating as ostrich anus and performing a woeful stand-up routine with Linda Robson from Birds of a Feather.

Tory high command suspended her from the party until she returns, warning she has serious questions to answer.

But today one of her daughters insisted she was cleared to take part by Mr Mitchell before he resigned last month.

Jennie Dorries told ITV's Daybreak that Mr Mitchell agreed that her mother could take the time off.

She said: ‘She did ask for the month off. The chief whip gave her permission. She did all she had to do before she left. She made arrangements for someone to take her place on Remembrance Sunday.’

Miss Dorries did not make clear whether her mother had explained she wanted to take part in a reality TV show on the other side of the world.

But Mr Mitchell is adamant that no conversation was had about being away from Parliament for a month, and certainly not to be a contestant on the ITV show fronted by Ant and Dec.

‘Conversations between the Chief Whip and colleagues are confidential,’ a spokesman for Mr Mitchell said.

‘But in this case Andrew is happy to confirm that permission to go to Australia for one month to take part in I’m A Celebrity was neither sought nor was it given.’

As MPs prepared to return to Westminster, Ms Dorries was performing a poorly-received comedy routine with Linda Robson from Birds of a Feather

There is widespread speculation in Westminster that when Ms Dorries returns from the jungle she will reject the idea of a meeting with Mr Mitchell’s successor, Sir George Young, and instead choose to sit as an independent MP on the opposition benches.

Mr Mitchell was forced to resign after a month of headlines about his foul-mouthed rant at Downing Street police officers who told him to get off his bike.

Before joining the show Nadine Dorries defended the decision to be away from her constituents, saying politicians needed to raise important issues on programmes watched by millions of people. She hoped to use the platform to discuss her campaign to lower the abortion limit.

Instead she has been voted to take part in a Buchtucker Trial which involved eating various animal body parts including a camel's toe and an ostrich's anus.

And her performance in a task telling jokes was deemed so dire she missed out on the chance to go to the jungle pub.

One of Ms Dorries's other daughters, Cassie, admitted she has repeatedly voted for her mother to take part in stomach-churning challenges in the jungle.

She told Daybreak she could not help but laugh at her mother's efforts on the notorious bushtucker trials, revealing: ‘I have voted for my mum for both of the trials - it's much more interesting to see her do it.’
