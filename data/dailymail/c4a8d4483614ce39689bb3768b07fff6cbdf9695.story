From Big Ben to the London Eye, you may think that you’ve seen the capital’s landmarks in every light possible.

But a team of intrepid free runners wearing specially-made neon suits have been photographed sprinting across bridges and jumping off the capital's monuments to create light displays that show their path.

It is the first time that a neon-effect free running performance has been completed in the UK.

Cool runnings: A team of intrepid free runners wearing specially-made neon suits have been photographed sprinting across bridges and jumping off monuments to create images that show their path

The pictures were created by long 
exposure shots which traced the movement of light through the image. A 
video was also made using a helicam to capture wide aerial shots of 
London.

The whole stunt was created to mark the launch of PlayStation 4’s latest game, called Infamous: Second son.

Free running team 3RUN set out to recreate scenes from the game, which is only available on the PlayStation console.

The game is set in Seattle and features a character called Delsin Rowe, who discovers an ability to absorb different powers from other super humans.

On the run, he uses neon to turn him into a human sniper and to run at speed across floors and up walls.

While the team of free runners might not have real super powers, they managed to complete a daredevil routine in complete darkness wearing the custom-made neon suits.

The neon suits took six weeks to make and featured hundreds of tiny lights that were hand-stitched on to them in order to capture the neon visual effects of the game as closely as possible.

They needed to allow the athletes to run with ease as well as creating a strobing lighting effect.

The stunt marked the first time the team had ever performed in the dark, and during some shots the runners were making their way across rooftops at dizzying heights of over 100ft.

Passers-by were treated to an electric display of colour as the team traversed iconic London landmarks including Millennium Bridge, Westminster Bridge and the London Eye at breakneck speeds.  

Chase Armitage, chief free runner and founder of 3RUN said: ‘Through the use of specially created neon suits, we were able to bring a whole new element of free running to life, which certainly stopped passers-by, who were amazed by the strobing light effects’

‘We have travelled the world with our free running projects but have never put our skills to the test in the dark before, so when PlayStation set us the challenge we jumped at the chance, Chase Armitage, chief free runner and founder of 3RUN said.
