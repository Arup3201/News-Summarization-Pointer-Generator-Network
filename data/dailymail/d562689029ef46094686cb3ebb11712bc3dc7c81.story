A new female orgasm drug could soon be available after successful trials.

Tefina, a ‘use-as-required’ nasal gel, was found to be safe and effective, its developers say.

The product contains the sex hormone  testosterone, low levels of which have been linked with poor libido.

As a result, the manufacturer of this new treatment, Trimel Pharmaceuticals Corporation, now plans to work towards bringing it to the market.

The gel is designed to be used for the treatment of Female Orgasmic Disorder, which is characterised by difficulty reaching orgasm and distress as a result of this difficulty.

During trials, 253 women with the condition in the U.S., Canada and Australia were each given one of three different doses of the drug - or a placebo.

They received treatment for 84 days and the researchers hoped to establish whether the treatment increased the frequency of orgasms.

They also hoped to discover whether the drug caused any side effects.

The researchers discovered that patients given the drug had an average of 2.3 orgasms during the trial period while the placebo group only had 1.7.

They also claim the patients did not suffer any adverse side effects as a result of using the gel.

‘Female Orgasmic Disorder is the second most prevalent sexual disorder affecting women,' said Dr Sheryl Kingsberg, the U.S. 
principal investigator for the Tefina Phase II clinical trial.

‘Approximately one in five women report difficulty with orgasm and one quarter of these show marked distress, a key criterion in a clinical diagnosis.

‘Currently, there are no approved pharmacological treatment options, leaving an unmet need that Tefina hopes to remedy,' added Dr Kingsberg, who is also professor of reproductive biology and psychiatry at Case Western Reserve
 University in Cleveland, Ohio.

Tom Rossi, Trimel President and CEO, added: ‘These results mark an important milestone in the development of Tefina.

‘They provide further evidence that Tefina could represent an important treatment option for the many women who suffer from this disorder.'
