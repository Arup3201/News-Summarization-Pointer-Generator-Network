Menace: Justin Carley poses on a social networking site

A boy of 12 who terrorised a neighbourhood with his appalling behaviour bragged he was being hauled to court for ‘anty soshal behavuare’.

Justin Carley destroyed the lives of residents by abusing and threatening them in the street, hurling dog dirt, kicking his football against parked cars, and throwing stones at windows.

He even cycled through a library and threatened to smash all of its windows.

The tearaway has been given a final warning and handed a two-year Asbo.

But even then he tried to put two fingers up at authority by taking to social media.

He boasted to friends of his impending court case on Facebook saying: ‘In court Wednesday for asbo ffs [for f****’* sake]. anty soshal behavuare.’

Before he was sentenced at Stockport magistrates’ court he posted another message complaining about the slow court procedure, saying: ‘cba [can’t be a***d] with this court came 9.45 still waiting and its 2.00.’

Afterwards he wrote in a further garbled outburst that he was unsure whether he would be able to stick to the two-year Asbo.

Neighbours say the boy, who lives with his mother, Jackie, 30, and an older sister in a three-bedroom terrace property in Brinnington, Stockport, is ‘out of control’ and has also been in trouble at school.

Last month his mother, who is single, wrote on Facebook: ‘P***** off with my sons school …every day theres a f****** problem with him if thay cant cope with him tell me and il find a school that can.

‘My son walked out off school and nobody can find him and thay leave it until 2pm to tell thay never know where he is most time.’

Neighbours spoke of their relief that action had been taken against the yob.

Justin Carley, 12, was given an ASBO after he repeatedly ignored warnings about his bad behaviour in Stockport. He complained about having to go to court for more 'anty-soshal behavuare' on Facebook

One woman, who was too scared to be named, said: ‘That boy has turned a very pleasant housing estate into a war zone.

Roger Phillips, chairman of Stockport Homes' board said they were committed to putting stop to bad behaviour that affects residents in the area 

‘His behaviour was insane. He had no respect for anyone, young or old, and basically ran riot.’

A pensioner added: ‘People’s lives were turned into a nightmare. He is out of control.

Everyone round here is sick and tired of his mother making excuses for him.

‘I’m afraid there is simply no one to discipline him and he’s been in a lot of trouble at school as well.’

The yob has been warned that one more step out of line and he could face five years in a young offenders’ institution.

He was warned six times by housing association bosses about his behaviour before being taken to court.

No legal restrictions were put in place on identifying Carley, whose name was also revealed by the housing association, Stockport Homes.

During the period of the Asbo, Carley must not act in an anti-social manner likely to cause harassment alarm or distress to anyone.
