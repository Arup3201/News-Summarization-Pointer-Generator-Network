Drug binge: Sophie Lee Turley who says she introduced Melissa Reid to drug gang that made her friend a mule

A third girl who says she almost became ensnared in the Ibiza cocaine smuggling plot has been questioned by British police.

Sophie Lee Turley says that after she and Melissa Reid were taken on a four-day drug binge by a man in Ibiza, she was targeted by the same gang that is said to have ensnared Reid and Michaella McCollum Connolly.

She says she escaped before being forced to carry drugs.

‘I went and hid for a few days as I was terrified,’ she said.

Miss Turley, a friend of Reid, is lying low in her home city of Nottingham, having been warned she had 24 hours to flee Ibiza.

She told The Mail on Sunday yesterday that Nottinghamshire police interviewed her last week.

‘I have not told them everything, just what they need to know,’ Miss Turley, 22, said. ‘I don’t want to get involved. There is a potential threat to my safety. I have taken advice from a solicitor who has said they cannot force me to co-operate.’

In an exchange with Melissa Reid’s mother on Facebook, Miss Turley admitted she introduced Melissa to the man her daughter says forced her to become a drugs mule.

Asked by Debra Reid to ‘tell us what you know about what has happened to our beautiful daughter’

Miss Turley replied: ‘I met a guy whom I introduced to Mel as we was all going out one night .  .  .

‘After he fuelled us all with drugs on what was a four-day binge he had somehow managed to have both mine and Mel’s passport details and we was booked on flights.

‘She was sent first and I went and hid for a few days as I was terrified. Mel assured me she was OK .  .  . I didn’t think it was her messaging me though, I thought it was the guys she was with.’

Later, she said, ‘the guys threatened us to keep quiet’ and added that when Melissa was arrested ‘they gave me 24 hours to disappear’.

‘I’ve come back home as I’m really scared for my safety .  .  . Mel never wanted to do this, the other girl was also forced.

‘I’m too scared to tell police in case these bad guys look for me.’

Miss Turley said the man who targeted the girls was called Joe, originally from Manchester, but now living in San Antonio, Ibiza. However, both arrested women said in statements to police that they knew him as Jake.

Meanwhile in Ibiza, associates of a taxi driver called Joe, believed to be the man referred to by Miss Turley, dismissed suggestions that he handed the girls to a drugs gang as ‘unbelievable’.

But Miss Turley told Melissa’s mother: ‘The only reason I can’t talk is people he [Joe] hangs round with know me from Nottingham which means he can find me and told me he will if I speak.’

Before signing off by apologising because her mother ‘doesn’t want me involved’, Miss Turley said she was willing for Mrs Reid to pass on her details to the ‘guy from the Foreign Office’.

She added: ‘I feel like I have to do something – I introduced her to the guy before he started forcing us all.’

The Foreign Office declined to comment last night, beyond saying it was providing consular assistance. Nottinghamshire police also refused to discuss its involvement in the case.

Melissa Reid, 20, is led away from the state prosecutor's office in Lima, her desperate mother asked Debra Reid asked Miss Turley to 'tell us what you know'

Melissa Reid’s father William has made clear that there are elements of his daughter’s story that he would like ‘clarity on’. Only people such as Miss Turley, among others, can provide it, he said.

‘I would like the authorities to vigorously investigate them, track them down, question them. Have they got any further vital information?’

His wife added: ‘Melissa is very sociable and was probably too trusting and she was definitely naive to the drugs culture.

‘But she is no angel and I suspect she may have experimented alongside her friends out there.

‘She is a good, honest girl and I believe she has been dragged into this against her will.’

The Mail on Sunday has established that the man named by Miss Turley works illegally as an unlicensed taxi driver on the Spanish holiday island. Also known as Joey, he is believed to live in cheap accommodation in San Antonio Bay, home to hundreds of young Britons working in bars and clubs for  the summer.

He is thought to have spent the past two summers living in Ibiza, initially working for around six weeks last year pulling in customers off the street for the Active Bar in San Antonio Bay.

The bar’s owner, a Scotsman called William, said: ‘He is back on the island this year, working as  a taxi driver.

‘I just can’t see him being involved in serious criminality and drugs gangs. It is just unbelievable.’
