A British oil worker who spent a terrifying 48 hour ordeal at the hands of kidnappers in Indonesia, fought back the tears as he told how his captors let him go because his Indonesian wife could not afford their £300,000 ransom demand.

Engineer Malcolm Primrose, 61, who was found yesterday in a palm oil plantation, said he had feared he was never going to see his wife and family again.

'Excuse me if I am a little bit 
emotional,' Mr Primrose as he sat with his wife Nurasiah at the police 
station in Parsi Putih village in the northern province of East Aceh.

'I can only thank God that everything turned out all right.'

Still in his blue work overalls and a
traditional patterned Indonesian scarf which his wife gave him on his 
return, the drilling supervisor said he was thankful his captor's 'did 
not hurt me in any way'.

The Scotsman admitted he had been afraid but 'they didn't hurt me, they fed me.'

He said that when they released him, the abductors showed him the way to an area where he was later picked up by police.

His wife told how the kidnappers had 
called her to demand the ransom but when negotiations broke down the men
gave up and released her husband later.

It is believed the kidnappers are former fighters from Ache's three-decade separatist struggle, a conflict which ended in 2005.

Mr Primrose, who works for an Indonesian
company in the northern province of Aceh, was snatched by the armed 
group on Tuesday when they ambushed his car as he was heading home.

The kidnappers tied up his driver and drove off with Mr Primrose.

A huge manhunt was launched, but police conceded the Scotsman could have been held prisoner anywhere in the jungle region of the province.

They anticipated a long-drawn out search - but were surprised when he was found at a security post in a palm oil plantation early today.

He told police that he was 'a bit shaken' but it is understood he did not need hospital treatment.Police Senior Commander Muhajir told the Jakarta Globe: 'We're taking him to Ranto Panjang police station to be questioned.'

Police have yet to release details of how and when the kidnappers made contact with Mr Primrose's family, but it is believed that the Scot had, under pressure, given them details of someone to call.

'When they (the kidnappers) contacted his family, they asked for a 5 billion rupiah ransom,' said Commander Muhajir, who uses only one name.

But the police officer said no ransom was paid and, expecting a long drawn out period of negotiation, searching officers and troops were surprised to hear he had been found at a security post.

It was not known if he was released or had escaped from his captors but first reports said police believe they had decided to let him go.

'I don't know of a precise reason for the kidnappers' decision to release Mr Primrose,' said Commander Muhajir.

'It's probably because of the size of the police operation with the help of soldiers,' he said.

The search operation had involved more than 100 police officers as well as soldiers.

The safe return of Mr Primrose does not put an end to the search for the kidnappers.

'We are still looking for them and will keep up the pressure until we find them,' said Commander Muhajir.

'It is very rare for people to be kidnapped in Aceh these days,' he added.

Relief: Police and troops had spread out in the region but there was no sign of Mr Primrose or his attackers until earlier today

'We have had our very serious troubles in the past, as well as the terrible tsunami in 2004, but things have settled down a lot in recent years.

'We were very surprised to hear that a foreigner had been kidnapped, but it is good news we have got him back.'

Mr Primrose is expected to spend several hours being questioned by police about his ordeal before he meets with British Embassy officials who have been sent to the area to assist in the search and now to debrief him.

The British Embassy in Jakarta said that it was grateful for the work put in by the Indonesian authorities in searching for Mr Primrose.

'We are delighted to confirm that Malcolm Primrose has been released,' the Embassy said in a statement.

'Embassy officials are with Mr Primrose and are providing consular assistance.

'We would like to place on record our warm thanks for the support we have received from the Indonesian authorities, as well as from the Governor of Aceh and his staff, the Chief of Aceh police and his team, and the many others who have worked so hard to secure his release.'

The Government's Foreign and Commonwealth Office warned that there is a high threat from terrorism in Indonesia.

It
says: 'Terrorist groups continue to plan attacks and have the capacity 
and intent to carry out these attacks at anytime and anywhere in the 
country.'

It advises 
visitors to 'exercise caution when travelling to Aceh, Central Sulawesi 
Province (especially Palu, Poso and Tentena), Maluku Province 
(especially Ambon), Papua and West Papua Province.'

The western coast of  Aceh was devastated by a tsunami in December 2004.

The
tsunami, caused by the Indian Ocean earthquake., killed an estimated 
170,000 people in Aceh and left about 500,000 homeless.

Just
months later, in March 2005, a second off-shore earthquake measuring 
9.1 on the Richter scale struck the sea bed near Aceh, killing a further
905 people and displacing f thousands more.
