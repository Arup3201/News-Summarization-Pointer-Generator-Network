Paul Smith is desperate to secure a rematch with WBO super-middleweight champion Arthur Abraham following his controversial defeat to the German-based Armenian over the weekend.

Abraham retained his 168lbs crown after a disputed unanimous decision victory over the British challenger in Kiel, Germany.

Scores of 117-110, 117-111 and 119-109 did not seem to reflect a tight encounter and the result was met with scorn from several commentators.

Smith told Sky Sports: 'It's just one of those things. The scoring was shocking but I  have to get on with it. It still hurts. It's still a loss but hopefully we can get the rematch.'

The 31-year-old (35-4, 20KOs) may be heartened by a tweet from the WBO, which said: 'The #WBO is waiting to receive the assigned supervisor's report and replaying the fight before giving an opinion on #AbrahamSmith.'

While overturning the result, or even deeming the bout a no-contest, would seem far-fetched, the sanctioning body could yet enforce a rematch by making Smith mandatory challenger.

Smith has received some encouragement from the WBO, who sent out this tweet on Monday

Smith says Abraham (41-4, 28KOs) promised a return bout at the post-fight press conference and the Liverpudlian is hopeful the two-weight world champion will stick to his word.

'The best outcome for me is for the WBO to watch the fight, sort the judges out, get three neutral and competent judges in, make me mandatory challenger and put the fight up for purse bids. Let's do it again and have an immediate rematch,' he said.

Smith gave a very good account of himself on Saturday and many have questioned the result

The judges voted unanimously in favour of Abraham, much to Smith's frustration and disappointment 

'He'll know in his head that he lost that fight and will he want to fight me again after that? I was meant to be a nice routine defence for him and I knew I wasn't. Everything I said I'd do before the fight I did it and I believe I should be sitting here with a world title.

'I spoke to Arthur in the press conference after the fight and I spoke to the promoter Kalle Sauerland. A translator said that Arthur said he'd fight me any time, so I leaned over and I said 'fight me next. Give me a rematch' and I put my hand out and he shook my hand.

'It's certainly not a contract but it's a gentleman's agreement. If he believes he'll fight me again, do it next - financially it'll make sense for him. He earned a lot of money fighting me and he'll earn even more this time. There's demand for a rematch now.'
