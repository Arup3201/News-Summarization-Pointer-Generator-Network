A 15-year-old Louisiana boy was arrested this week for using an iPhone app to jokingly shoot up his high school.

Using ‘The Real Strike,’ a simulated first person shooter overlaid onto video of the app user’s choice, the student uploaded the fake shooting of H.L Bourgeois High School, in Gray, LA., to YouTube and was arrested on terror charges soon after.

Authorities allege they were thwarting a potential threat to the school despite the student’s parents insisting their son has no access to guns.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Realistic: The app simulates a shooting about as realistically as a phone is able

‘We don’t know at what time that game becomes a reality,’ a sheriff’s department spokesperson preached to WGNO.

Police became aware of the video after another parent saw it on YouTube.

The boy did admit to police that he was frustrated about being bullied, the station reported, but insisted he never meant to actually shoot or harm anyone.

Undeterred, authorities still charged him with terrorizing and interference of the operation of a school.‘Something more serious such as a school shooting may occur,’ the sheriff;s office spokesperson explained.

Not everyone agreed.

‘It sounds like something a kid would do to let off some stress,’ a local resident told the station.Classmates were shocked it went so far.

‘It’s just an app man,’ one student told the station, with two others around him agreeing.

‘Everything that goes on in these students lives is in a joking manner, so, it’s just how we were raised,’ another student said.

The only mistake it seems the boy’s classmates feel he actually made was putting the video on YouTube.

‘He messed up when he put it on YouTube, how you going to put it on YouTube?’ The student mockingly said to the station.

‘With all the school shootings that have happened in the United States, it not a very good time to be playing this game,’ the official added.

The accused potential high school shooter's parents have assured all concerned their son has no access to any firearms. Despite being fingered by cops as a security threat, he has not been publicly identified.

MailOnline was unable to reach local authorities or the shoot'em up app's developers for comment.
