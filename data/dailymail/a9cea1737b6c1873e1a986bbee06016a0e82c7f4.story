A stunning timelapse video has showcased the beauty of Tower Bridge by day and night including the impressive glass bottomed walkway.

Chad Gordon Higgins, who is originally from the West Midlands but now lives in London, took 12,076 pictures in and around the capital's landmark, and then spent seven-and-a-half hours condensing these into 3,878 to make the video.

The 37-year-old spent over 18 hours in London shooting the footage.

Speaking to MailOnline Travel, Mr Higgins said: - 'I've filmed a couple of times in the underbelly of Tower Bridge for various programmes, but I've never actually been up to the walkways. 

'The exposed ironwork, girders, suspension and the sheer amount of rivets put in to hold it altogether is mind-blowing considering it's 120 years old.

'During one of the shots I rested against one of the top suspension cables taking in the views and you could feel the feint vibrations of the traffic below, the cables that have resonated the crossing of probably, billions of people over years gone past and now with the addition of the glass floors, it's a great sight to behold. 

'Everyone is on a journey somewhere.' 

Before the stampede: The inside the bridge before tourists from all over the world ascend on London's most famous bridge

Impressive: Mr Higgins described Tower Bridge as structurally 'mind blowing, considering it is 120 years old'

Tower Bridge last month unveiled its £1m glass walkway 140ft above River Thames, costing just £9 to visit.

It has been designed to give tourists, sightseers and thrill-seekers a unique view from a bridge that bills itself as the most famous in the world, not forgetting a peek at the workings of a legendary feat of engineering when the bridge below opens.

For the faint of heart or weak of knee, it may be reassuring to learn that each glass panel along the 36ft walkway is getting on for three inches thick and weighs nearly 1,200lb.

The iconic Tower Bridge is a magnificent sight to behold, and even better when contrasted at various points throughout the day

The brand new glass walkway, which is designed to enthrall the general public, rather than instill fear

Tower Bridge Exhibition executives insist the idea is to enthral rather that scare people.

Higgins added: 'Shooting timelapse for a living means that I get to spend a lot of time on rooftops for sunrise and sunsets for various TV companies.

'I've recently filmed from the Shard but the vintage view from Tower Bridge is certainly unique.' 

Higgins is doing a free talk about timelapse this Saturday (December 6) in Kings Cross, London and he will be attempting to create the biggest crowd-sourced timelapse of London.
