Janet Jackson's husband, Wissam Al Mana, has been accused of firing a female employee from his interior design firm after she reported being raped in Dubai and was then thrown in prison for having extramarital sex.

A spokesman for the Qatari billionaire's company, Al Mana Interiors, strongly denied the claims from Marte Deborah Dalelv, saying instead its representatives were 'by her side' throughout the 'ordeal' and that the firm was forced to let her go after she 'declined to have positive and constructive discussions about her employment status.'

The Norwegian 24-year-old was sentenced to 16 months in prison this week for having sex outside of marriage after she was raped by a co-worker in March during a business trip to Dubai.

Dalelv reported the sexual assault to police but instead of helping her they arrested her and took her passport away. Her rapist was sentenced to three months less prison time than she got.

According to Verdens Gang, three weeks after she reported the crime Dalelv was suspended from her job. Three weeks after that she got a termination letter, signed off by Al Mana himself.

'Further to the suspension letter 
notified to you on 20th March 2013, we hereby inform you that you 
employment with Al Mana Interiors W.L.L. is terminated for misconduct 
and breach of your employment duties, effective immediately,' the letter
 reads.

Norwegian businesswoman Marte Deborah Dalelv, 24, has been sentenced to 16 months in prison for extramarital sex after she reported being raped

'... your 
employment agreement is terminat(ed) due to your unacceptable and 
improper behavior during your last business trip in Dubai, which has 
resulted in your arrest by the Police Authorities in UAE.'

On Saturday, Al Mana Interiors claimed it was forced to let Dalelv go after she 'declined to have positive and constructive discussions about her employment status' and not because of the rape.

'We are sympathetic to Marte Dalelv 
during this very difficult situation,' the statement reads.

'Al Mana Interiors has repeatedly 
offered Marte support and company representatives were by her side 
throughout the initial investigation and police interviews, and spent 
days at both the police station and the prosecutor's office to help win 
her release.

'Company 
representatives have been supportive and in communication with Marte 
throughout her ordeal. Only when Ms. Dalelv declined to have positive 
and constructive discussions about her employment status, and ceased 
communication with her employer, was the company forced to end our 
relationship with her. The decision had nothing to do with the rape 
allegation, and unfortunately neither Ms. Dalelv nor her attorneys have 
chosen to contact the company to discuss her employment status.

'We
 continue to be open to helping Ms. Dalelv and extending her resources 
during the Dubai legal process. We are hopeful that we can resume a 
positive discussion about the assistance she needs during this difficult
 time.'

Dalelv
 reported the sexual assault in March, after which she had to 
spend days in a cell before she was allowed to use a telephone.

With
 the help of family members, the Norwegian consulate was able to 
negotiate a release and she has been living under the protection of the 
Norwegian Sailor's Church until her sentencing this week.

Waiting game: Marte Deborah Dalelv, pictured in Dubai, faces an uncertain future as Norway doesn't have an extradition treaty with Dubai

Dalelv claims she was fired from her position with Al Mana Interiors - which is owned by Janet Jackson's husband, Wissam Al Mana -  during the ordeal

'I
 received the harshest sentence for sex outside marriage, harshest 
sentence for drinking alcohol and on top of that I was found guilty of 
perjury,' she told Verdens Gang.

'It is a terrible situation she is in,' said Gisle Meling, the priest at the Norwegian Sailor's Church.

'We
 are very surprised and had hoped it would go another way, but we live 
in a country which has a justice system which draws its conclusions with
 the help of Sharia law.'

Dalelv was sentenced to one year and four months in jail but as Norway has no extradition treaty with Dubai, her future is uncertain.

Janet
 Jackson married the Qatari billionaire in a secret ceremony last year. 
The pair have been together for three years after meeting in 2010.

The young Norwegian woman's horror story is not unique.

Earlier
 this year Australian Alicia Gali, 27, spoke of how she was thrown in a 
Dubai jail for eight months after she reported a rape.

Dark side: Having been detained in Dubai since the assault in March, Ms  Dalelv has now been found guilty of sex outside marriage, drinking alcohol without a licence and perjury and was jailed for 16 months

Gali was working at hotel chain Starwood when her drink was spiked in the staff bar.

She
 awoke to find that three colleagues had raped her, but when she went to
 a hospital for help, they turned her over to the police and she was 
charged with illicit sex outside marriage.

Under
 UAE law, rapists can only be convicted if either the perpetrator 
confesses or if four adult Muslim males witness the crime.

Under
 the Sharia-influenced laws, sex before marriage is completely forbidden
 and an unmarried couple holding hands in public can be jailed.

Foreigners jailed in Dubai are deported immediately after completing their sentences.
