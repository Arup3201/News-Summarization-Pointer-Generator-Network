Copycats: A commercial satellite flying over the Persian Gulf photographed what appears to be a replica of a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier under construction at a ship yard near Bandar Abbas, Iran

Iran is in the process of building a mock-up of an American Nimitz-class aircraft carrier with the possible goal of blowing it up as a publicity stunt.

Construction on the crude model appears to be in full swing at a shipyard near Bandar Abbas, as shown in newly released commercial satellite images.

'They got this barge and threw some wood on top of it to make it look like the USS Nimitz. That's all we know for sure,' a U.S. defense official told AFP.

Officials in the Obama administration believe that the faux carrier might be used for propaganda value, but they are not sure at this time what Teheran is hoping to accomplish with this project.

The wooden, non-operational aircraft carrier made to look like a Nimitz-class nuclear-powered American vessel was first spotted on the Persian Gulf last summer, the New York Times reported. 

Besides having the shape of the 1,100-foot-long carriers, such as USS Abraham Lincoln and USS Carl Vinson, the shipbuilders also replicated the distinctive white markings on the bow.

A satellite flying over Gachin shipyard also photographed a fake plane parked on the deck of the equally fake carrier.

But officials are not overly concerned with the boxy, too-short replica, saying that unlike the real thing, Iran's glorified barge is not operational or propelled by nuclear power.

The real thing: The U.S. Navy has ten Nimitz-class aircraft carriers, which are 1,100 feet in length and feature a nuclear propulsion system

It still remains a mystery what Teheran is planning to do with the copy once it is complete.

One theory is that the Nimitz-inspired vessel could be towed to sea and detonated, with the explosion shown on state TV for anti-American propaganda purposes.

According to the Times, Iran has used barges for televised missile target practice in the past.

Devil's in the details: Iranian shipbuilders supplied their glorified barge with white markings characteristic of Nimitz carriers, but officials are certain that the fake vessel is not operational and has no nuclear power

FARS News reported that in June, Iran launched its overhauled destroyer named Bayando, but American analysts are convinced that the Middle Eastern nation is not capable of building an aircraft carrier.

‘It is not surprising that Iranian naval forces might use a variety of tactics -- including military deception tactics -- to communicate and possibly demonstrate their resolve in the region,’ said another U.S. official.

The revelations concerning the barge come four months after Teheran came to a temporary agreement with the world powers over its nuclear program, parts of which are expected to be rolled back in exchange for an end to some economic sanctions, according to CNN.

Tensions between Iran and the U.S. have been at an all-time low recently, and over the past year, there have been fewer Iranian speedboats pestering American warships in the Strait of Hormuz.

On Thursday, President Barack Obama sent a message to the Iranian people to mark the Persian New York, saying that he is 'committed to diplomacy.'
