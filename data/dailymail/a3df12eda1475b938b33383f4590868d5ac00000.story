A well-loved high school photography teacher in California was hit and killed by a train while standing on railroad tracks and taking pictures of an oncoming locomotive. 

Kathryn Mary Carlisle, 52, taught art to 600 students at St Francis High School, an all girls Catholic school in Sacramento, California, and was a respected photographer and visual artist in her own right.

Authorities say she was on the tracks taking a picture of an oncoming train when a different train traveling in the opposite direction struck her from behind.

Revered: Kathy Carlisle, 52, was loved by the 600 students at the all-girls Catholic school where she taught photography and art

Tribute: Class was canceled at St Francis High School, where she taught, and the students attended a memorial service there on Monday

'She was so skilled and passionate in her work, and really had a gift. The girls understood that she had a gift to share with them,' school president Margo Reid Brown told KCRA-TV.

Ms Carlisle, a married mother of three, was taking photographs of a train on the tracks near the campus of St Francis on Saturday afternoon.

Authorities say she likely just did not hear or see the other train coming. She died at the scene.

The school canceled classes on Monday and organized a memorial service for Ms Carlisle for students, teachers and parents.

Grateful students tweeted about how much the teacher had meant to them and how much she had touched their lives.

'You brought such a colorful spark to each of our lives and we love and miss you so much ms. Carlisle more than words can express,' one student wrote. 

Another tweeted about her love for the color orange: 'So much love for Ms. Carlisle. You will be missed so much. We will never forget the woman in orange. Rest in peace.'

'No one can replace Mrs. Carlisle at sf she wasn't like any other 
teacher. I am so lucky to have been in her class this semester,' another
student said.

Ms Carlisle was particularly well known for her work teaching about the Holocaust. She used painting and other forms of artistic expression to help students understand the depths of the brutality suffered by Jews and other enemies of the Nazi state.
