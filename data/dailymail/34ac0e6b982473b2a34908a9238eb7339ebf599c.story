A never-seen-before photograph of the atomic bombing of the Japanese city Hiroshima has emerged for sale and is expected to go for $50,000 (£30,000) at auction.

The black-and-white image was taken from the window of one of the U.S bombers on the historic, top-secret raid and is the only unofficial photo of the bombing known to exist.

It shows the enormous mushroom cloud rising above the city moments after bomber Enola Gay dropped its catastrophic payload on August 6, 1945.

Chilling: This never-before-seen photograph of the Hiroshima mushroom cloud was taken from the bomber Necessary Evil about one minute after the explosion - and is now going to be auctioned

Top secret raid: The Enola Gay dropped the Hiroshima bomb on August 6, 1945, three days before another atomic payload was dropped on Nagasaki

Historic item: Pictured left is 2nd Lt Russell Gackenbach's Agfa camera, which he smuggled on board the Necessary Evil and used to photograph the Hiroshima bomb going off, while pictured right is 2nd Lt Gackenback today

The poignnat photo was taken by Second Lieutenant Russell Gackenbach, navigator onboard Necessary Evil, one of the three B-29 planes that took part in the attack.

As the three bombers banked away from the atomic blast, 2nd Lt Gackenbach took a photo of it on his own camera which he had smuggled onboard the plane.

The photograph is thought to have been taken around a minute after the explosion, from 12 miles away at 30,000 feet.

The bomb, nicknamed Little Boy, detonated at 1,900ft at 8.15am and instantly wiped out much of the city, killing an estimated 160,000 people in the process.

Despite only using 1.7 per cent of its potential force, the bomb was the most devastating ever dropped, around 2,000 times more powerful than British 22,000lb Grand Slam bomb.

The grainy image of the explosion has never before been published, remaining in 2nd Lt Gackenback's posession until the 1990s when he sold it to a private collector.

A three-ins by two-ins contact print of the photo is now up for sale at Bonhams alongside the Agfa Viking camera 2nd Lt Gackenback used to take the photograph.

At the same auction, the flight log of the late Brigadier General Paul W Tibbets, pilot of the Enola Gay when he had the rank of Colonel, is also for sale for $100,000 (£60,000).

It contains the records of every flight he undertook throughout the war, including the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Tibbets trained for several months for the mission, with the bomber named Enola Gay after his mother.

The decision to unleash an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, a city of military significance, was taken by U.S president Harry S Truman when the Japanese refused to surrender in July 1945.

In a statement broadcast after the attack, Truman said: ‘It is an atomic bomb. It is a harnessing of the basic power of the universe.

‘The force from which the sun draws its power has been loosed against those who brought war to the Far East.’

Three days after the bombing of Hiroshima, another atomic bomb, called Fat Man, was dropped on the southern port city of Nagasaki, killing another 75,000 people.

On August 15 Emperor Hirohito announced the surrender of Japan, effectively ending the Second World War.

Tom Lamb, from auctioneers Bonhams, said: ‘Russ was the navigator onboard Necessary Evil, one of two planes accompanying Enola Gay on the bombing raid.

‘The plane was full of scientists and journalists who were there to study and report on the blast. Russ was not supposed to have taken his personal camera onboard but he did.

‘As his plane banked away from the blast he took the camera out and snapped this shot. At the time they were at about 30,000ft and 12 miles from the blast.

‘There were official photographs of the explosion but this is the only personal photograph that was taken.

‘Russ kept hold of the photo until the 1990s when he sold it, along with other memorabilia from the raid, to a private collector in the U.S who has had it ever since.

‘This poignant photograph has never been published.

‘It shows an iconic moment in history, of which this is the only privately taken photograph. There is nothing else like this out there.’

Also in the sale are four photos, a Mohawk watch, a bombers patch, 13 badges and uniform pins and an almost unused AAF cloth chart of the East China Sea, Japan and South China Sea previously owned by 2nd Lt Gackenback

The auction will take place in New York on June 5.
