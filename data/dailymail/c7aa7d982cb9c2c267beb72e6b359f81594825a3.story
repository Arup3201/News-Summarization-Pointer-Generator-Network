She was in one of the most popular girl bands of the 2000s.

But Ashley Roberts doesn't look back on her Pussycat Dolls heyday with fondness - at least not when it comes to their style.

In a recent interview about her top fashion and beauty tips the 31-year-old Dancing On Ice judge was asked if she'd ever had any fashion disasters, to which she replied: 'Didn't you see the Pussycat Dolls? There were some outrageous outfIts!'

The modern burlesque group was famed 
for their risqué ensembles and sexy dance moves. They would often show 
up to evens in basques and stockings ... and little else.

Roberts revealed the top beauty products she swears by in the Express interview, including Garnier's
5 Second Perfect Blur primer and Caffeine Eye Roll-On.

The I'm A Celebrity ... Get Me Out Of Here runner up, who idolises Goldie Hawn, Kate Moss, Sienna Miller and Gwen Stefani, admits she's partial to a bright lipstick, especially Maybelline's Color Sensational in Electric Orange.

Her all-time favourite outfit was a red Alexander McQueen dress

Roberts, the current face of Garnier No Streaks Bronzer, revealed her secret to fabulous hydrated skin is to drink lots of water, and gave
her top tips on applying the perfect fake tan.

'Exfoliate, especially 
around the ankles, wrists and around your armpits, before you apply,' 
she said.

She also recommends holding the can of tan far enough from the body so that it sprays evenly.

In terms of diet, the super-trim singer likes to eat healthily with plenty of protein and fresh vegetables.

'I also drink a lot of raw juices. But I still go out for the occasional Mexican or treat myself to a cookie,' she said.

Though it's not hard for her to stay in shape as she dances for a living and is a self-confessed exercise junkie.

'[I do] hot yoga, spinning, circuit training, hiking… I love exercise!'

Ashley confessed she loves mixing designer and High Street fashion, pairing Louboutin shoes with pieces from Topshop and Balmain.

Her all-time favourite outfit was a 
red Alexander McQueen dress she wore 'and loved' to a Cartier event in 
2009 - when she partied with Leonardo DiCaprio until 2am.

The 34-year-old actor spent the afternoon at the Windsor party wooing the former Pussycat Doll.

The pair ended up partying into the early hours today at Mayfair bar Whisky Mist.

The source said the actor, who split with Bar Rafeali the previous month after a four year romance, was 'only interested in talking to Ashley and the pair were getting on really well.'

Maybe they were swapping fashion tips?
