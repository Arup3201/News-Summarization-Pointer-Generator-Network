Steven Gerrard struggled to make an impression as Liverpool were beaten 3-1 by West Ham on Saturday, leading to suggestions that age and fatigue is starting to catch up with the 34-year-old captain.

The midfielder has played every minute of Liverpool's season so far and, judging by the statistics from the match at Upton Park, it's taking its toll.

Gerrard surrendered possession on 14 occasions, very unlike him, and only Raheem Sterling (20) gave the ball away more in the Liverpool team.

Steven Gerrard was poor against West Ham, as his stats from the game show. Is age finally catching up with Liverpool’s 34-year-old captain?

14 Gerrard lost the ball 14 times. Only Raheem Sterling (20) lost it more for Liverpool.

11 He misplaced 11 passes in the opposition half, more than any Liverpool player.

25% Gerrard won just 25 per cent of his duels, the worst percentage of any Liverpool player.

Only six players in last year’s top six squads are older than Gerrard, and most now play bit-part roles.

The former England midfielder also misplaced 11 passes in the opposition half, more than any other Liverpool player, and that resulted in a poor passing completion rate of 57.7 per cent in West Ham territory.

He also won just 25 per cent of his duels, the worst percentage of any player in the team.

Gerrard is pretty much unique in the Premier League for the amount of minutes he's expected to put in for his age and Brendan Rodgers will consider resting him for a game or two to restore him to somewhere near his best form.

But that break of two or three games is out of the question. Gerrard should be nowhere near the midweek Capital One Cup tie with Middlesbrough but he'll be needed in Saturday's Merseyside derby against Everton. A tough trip to Basle in the Champions League then follows.

The international break that follows Liverpool's home match with West Brom on October 4 can't come soon enough. 

His application can't be faulted, however. Gerrard ran 6.4 miles against West Ham, second only to his midfield partner Jordan Henderson, but his usual influence just wasn't there.

Having been away from European competition last season, Liverpool must now quickly reacquaint themselves with the punishing routine of playing Premier League at the weekend and Champions League on Tuesday or Wednesday.

Despite the scoreline in east London, Rodgers insisted afterwards that wouldn't be a problem: 'It's a tiring competition, the Champions League, but we've earned the right to be in it and we also have to do well in the Premier League.

'There's the preparation time, the travel time, and then you need your players to recover after games in order to get ready for the next one.'
