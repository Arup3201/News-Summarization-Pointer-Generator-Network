The seventh and last series of American TV hit Mad Men kicks off tonight in the UK.

Fans are now only 14 episodes away from losing Don Draper and his advertising cronies forever.

And whilst we will miss his martini swilling and sexist scheming, the beginning of the end sounds like the perfect excuse to plan a trip to New York.

The final countdown: The last season of Mad Men featuring (l-r) Joan Harris (Christina Hendricks), Don Draper (Jon Hamm), Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss), Stan Rizzo (Jay R Ferguson), Michael Ginsberg (Ben Feldman) and Harry Crane (Rich Sommer) start sto air in the UK on Tuesday April 16

A man without a plan: As the show opens in January 1968 Don's life appears to be crumbling around him, but he certainly had fun getting to breaking point

Inspired by the terribly glamorous men 
and women of the series British Airways has created a guide to the best 
places to experience that 1960s vibe in the city today.

THE ROOSEVELT HOTEL

The Roosevelt Hotel has featured several times in the show and was the place that Don stayed when he split from wife Betty. Visit the Madison Club Lounge bar to absorb yourself in the real glamour of the 1960s.

THE WALDORF ASTORIA

One of New York’s first grand hotels, and mentioned on the show in relation to its menu. We know Don would rather down gin than eat his greens but recommend going for the waldorf salad.

Art deco: The Waldorf Astoria is one of New York's most legendary hotels

Waldorf salad: Characters in the show are fans of the grand hotel's signature dish

THE PIERRE

The Pierre is Manhattan’s premier social and business address. The characters used one of the rooms here as an office.

Stay at the 5* The Pierre, A Taj Hotel from £979 (based on travel in May).

Luxurious: The Pierre hotel briefly served as the office of Sterling Cooper Draper Price

This restaurant is featured as a location in the show and is a romantic and glamorous location for any Mad Men enthusiast.

Carry on the date at the nearby 5* Andaz 5th Avenue a luxury boutique hotel. Prices start at £799 (based on travel in May/June).

Memorable: Oyster Bar is  believed to be where Don takes Roger Sterling for lunch in one episode, but is not mentioned by name

A more thorough way of taking in the sights of Sixties Manhattan is to take a walk in Don's footsteps with a full guided tour by madmentour.com.

The two-hour Daytime Tour takes in eight locations depicted on the show with the guide discussing the significance of the location and showing clips of Mad Men to see how they re-created New York City in the 60s on an L.A. set.

The £90 ($150) Evening Tour includes cocktails at three different establishments featured on the show. The company promises that by the evening's end you will have learned about the ad industry of the 1960's, experienced a full tour of Madison Avenue and lived like a Mad Man or Woman in some of New York's most legendary watering holes as well as taking homw a package of vintage pictures.

British Airways also has a collection of heritage posters used to promote travel between London and New York in the 1960s.

Paul
 Jarvis, British Airways Museum Archivist and author said: 'It wasn’t really until the late sixties that the British public 
considered going abroad for holiday. It was a very exciting time, when 
the world was still being discovered.'
