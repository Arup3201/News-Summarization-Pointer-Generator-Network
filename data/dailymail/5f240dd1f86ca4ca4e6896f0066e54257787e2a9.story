Stanford researchers have developed adapters (pictured) that enable a smartphone to capture images of the front and back of the eye

Plenty of people put off eye tests because of the expense or the time it takes to see a specialist.

But these problems could become a thing of the past as researchers have developed cheap adapters that let a smartphone take high-quality pictures of the front and back of the eye.

They claim to make it easy for anyone with basic training to take a picture of the eye and pass it to experts who can interpret it and then store it as part of a patient’s electronic records.

‘Think Instagram for the eye,’ said one of the developers, Robert Chang, who is assistant professor of ophthalmology of Stanford University School of Medicine.

They believe their technology can increase access to eye-care services as well as to improve doctors’ ability to advise on patient care remotely.

Current equipment used to photograph the eye costs tens of thousands of dollars and requires extensive training to use properly. Some rural areas of the world do not have access to it at all.

Ophthalmology resident Dr David Myung, who is lead-author of the paper describing the technology, said: ‘Adapting smartphones for the eye has the potential to enhance the delivery of eye care - in particular, to provide it in places where it’s less accessible.

‘Whether it’s in the emergency department, where patients often have to wait a long time for a specialist, or during a primary-care physician visit, we hope that we can improve the quality of care for our patients, especially in the developing world where ophthalmologists are few and far between.

‘Imagine a car accident victim arriving in the emergency department with an eye injury resulting in a hyphema - blood inside the front of her eye. Normally the physician would have to describe this finding in her electronic record with words alone.

The researchers believe the technology is a step towards remote diagnosis of conditions. While microscope adapters for smartphones that can take images of the front of the eye are available, they are time consuming.

It's a cheap adapter that lets a smartphone take high-quality pictures of the front and back of the eye.

The gadget claims to make it easy for anyone with basic training to take a picture of the eye and pass it to experts who can interpret it.

It could increase access to eye-care services as well as to improve doctors’ ability to advise on patient care remotely.

The device offers point-and-shoot ability in seconds, not minutes, with instant upload to a secure server to store patient records.

First prototypes were built using inexpensive parts including plastic caps and spacers, LEDs, switches, universal mounts, macro lenses and even a handful of Lego bricks.

A computerised model of the prototypes was used to produce 3D-printed versions, now dubbed Eye-Go.

A clinical study of the quality of the smartphone images will be conducted in the Stanford Emergency Department, while a second study will test the ability of images taken with the adapters to track eye disease in patients with diabetes.

‘Smartphones today not only have the camera resolution to supplement those words with a high-resolution photo, but also the data-transfer capability to upload that photo securely to the medical record in a matter of seconds,’ he explained.

Dr Myung believes the technology is a step towards remote diagnosis of conditions.

While microscope adapters for smartphones that can take images of the front of the eye are available, they are time consuming and inconvenient, he explained.

‘Given the fast pace of patient care, he wanted point-and-shoot ability in seconds, not minutes, with instant upload to a secure server,’ Dr Myung said.

So they started designing a pocket-sized adapter that makes the phone do most of the ‘heavy lifting’ and after several prototypes, found a combination of magnification and lighting elements that worked.

‘It took some time to figure out how to mount the lens and lighting elements to the phone in an efficient yet effective way,’ said Dr Myung, who built the prototypes with inexpensive parts including plastic caps and spacers, LEDs, switches, universal mounts, macro lenses and even a handful of Lego bricks.

After successfully imaging the front of the eye, he focused on visualising the inside lining of the back of the eye, called the retina.

‘Taking a photo of the retina is harder because you need to focus light through the pupil to reach inside the eye,’ Dr Myung said.

He worked out the perfect distance and lighting conditions for a simple adapter that connects a conventional examination lens to a phone to do this.

A computerised model of the prototypes was used to produce 3D-printed versions, according to the study, which was published in the Journal of Mobile Technology in Medicine.

A clinical study of the quality of the smartphone images will be conducted in the Stanford Emergency Department, while a second study will test the ability of images taken with the adapters to track eye disease in patients with diabetes.

A small batch of adapters, currently dubbed EyeGo will be produced for distribution and will be available for purchase for research purposes only.
