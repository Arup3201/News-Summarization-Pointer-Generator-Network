A grandmother was crushed to death by a falling tree branch in front of her young grandchildren while waiting for a bus.

Rambai Senghani, 56, was taking the children, aged five and two-and-half, home from school when the branch crashed 30ft to the ground at around 4pm yesterday.

The terrified children, said to be pupils at nearby Donnington Primary School in Willesden Green, north west London, escaped death by inches.

Tragedy: A 56-year-old woman was killed at this bus stop in Willesden Green, London, when a huge branch fell on top of her while she was taking her two grandchildren home from school

Workers at a health centre opposite joined horrified passers-by in trying to lift the 20ft branch to free the woman, but she was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.

A man in his 70s, who is also believed to
 have been waiting at the bus stop, was injured and taken to hospital, 
where his condition was today described as 'serious'.

Today relatives paid tribute to their 'hero, teacher and foundation'.

Laying flowers at the scene, Mrs Senghani daughter, the mother of the two children, was too upset to speak.

Four family members held each other as they laid a bouquet of roses and lilies with the message: 'To our dearest mother, our hero, our teacher, our foundation... Rest in peace we will never forget you.'

Unstable: The 20ft branch fell to the ground after shearing off from this part of the tree

Scene: Branches believed to be from the fallen tree lay next to the wall where Rambai Senghani was sitting

Another relative, Ratan Patel, who visited the scene, said: 'She died here, it’s so sad, I will miss her.

'She was a very good lady, so kind and a family lady.

'She looks after the grandchildren every day. Her grandkids were asking is she going to be ok, is my grandma going to be alright?'

Police cordoned off the road for several hours before her body, which had been covered with a blue plastic sheet, was taken away by ambulance at 9pm last night.

Workers with chainsaws chopped up the branch.

At 2pm this afternoon, three council contractors arrived to make the tree safe.

However, the bus stop where the tragedy happened had remained in use throughout the day.

Neighbours in the tree-lined Harlesden Road today told how they heard a loud crash as the branch snapped and fell 25 feet onto a wall where Mrs Senghani had been sitting in the shade.

Grief: Floral tributes are left next to the tree

Jacki Park, who lives in a block of flats overlooking the No. 6 bus stop, said: 'The sound was terrifying.

'My heart stopped when I looked out. The tree was lying across the road and the woman’s legs were sticking out from underneath.

'A car stopped and people ran out and they tried to lift the tree to free her.

'People from the health centre opposite rushed out and were trying to save her. I saw an elderly man shaking on the pavement.

'There
 was a little boy sitting on the wall and the branch was almost on top 
of him, just inches from his legs. I don’t know how it missed him. It’s a
 miracle.

'He was screaming 
and he couldn’t move. A man came and led him away. Another child, a 
little girl, was standing just down the pavement.

'A scooter was by her body I think it belonged to the little boy.

'That’s my stop. I’d got off a bus just minutes before the tree fell. It could have been me. I’m so sorry for that lady.'

Judy Kerr, 71, who lives yards from 
the scene, said told how neighbours had been concerned over the 
maintenance of the trees which stand along the perimeter of gardens 
outside her apartment block where Mrs Senghani died.

She
 added: 'For the last few years we have said that something serious is 
going to happen because when it’s windy those trees sway so much. They 
need to be cut down.

'The 
council has come to prune the trees but they only do the lower branches 
and never touch the top. They should have done something with them a 
long time ago.'

Brent Council has launched an investigation into the accident amid claims by residents that the trees had not been properly maintained.

Questions remain: Brent Council has launched an investigation into the accident amid claims by residents that the trees had not been properly maintained

On its website, the council has recorded a previous tree fall at the same spot, near the junction of Harlesden Road and Donnington Road.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'Police were called to Donnington Road to reports of part of a tree collapsed on the pavement at approximately 4pm on Tuesday.

'Two people received injuries. London’s Air Ambulance and paramedics were called to the scene.

'One woman, aged 56, was pronounced dead at the scene. Next of kin are aware.

A post-mortem examination will take place in due course.

'A man in his 70s was also injured. He was taken to a west London hospital where he is in serious condition. Inquiries continue.'

A Brent Council spokeswoman said: 'This is a very sad situation and our thoughts are with the families and the victims of this tragic accident.

'At the moment we are unable to confirm the detail of what has happened. We will do so as soon as we receive further information.'
