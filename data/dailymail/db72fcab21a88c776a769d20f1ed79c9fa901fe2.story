Legendary radio announcer Casey Kasem will die in the next few months according to a representative of his wife, Jean.

TMZ.Com reports legal documents submitted by Kasem's wife during a small claims court case last week between Kasem and a former caregiver states: 'My husband is terminally ill and unable to leave home.'

The Kasems were represented in court by the wife of Jean's lawyer who requested a continuance of the case for a 'few months'. According to the legal request, that is the period of time given for Kasem's 'situation to resolve or end, unfortunately.'

The revealing case, in which Kasem's former housekeeper and caregiver Hilda Loza sued for $10,000 claiming she was mistreated and cheated by Jean, was thrown out of court on Friday because the suit was improperly served, according to a judge.

Kasem, now 81 years old, is an American pop culture legend whose voice became familiar to millions around the world as host of the iconic internationally-syndicated radio show American Top 40.

He also voiced the popular character Shaggy from the cartoon series Scooby-Doo.

Kasem was born Kemal Amin Kasem in Detroit, Michigan, in 1932 to Lebanese parents who migrated from the British Mandate of Palestine before coming to the United States.

In her suit, Loza alleged Jean, Kasem's second wife, denigrated her cooking, ordered her to drive Casey around Los Angeles but would not pay her gas expenses, and suggested the housekeeper would steal food, towels, toilet paper and silverware even though nothing was ever alleged stolen.

The suit is the second case this week involving Kasem and his wife.

A judge declared last week he would not intervene in Kasem's affairs after a court-appointed attorney said the ill radio host had received adequate medical care for advanced Parkinson's disease.

Attorney Samuel Ingham told Judge Roy Paul that he visited Kasem and did not see an immediate need for a 'conservatorship'.

Conservatorship is a legal term where a guardian is appointed by a judge to manage the financial affairs and daily life of an individual with physical or mental limitations or old age.

Kasem's daughter Julie, from the radio star's first marriage, had filed a petition for a temporary conservatorship, accusing her father's second wife of blocking her and two of her siblings from seeing their father and preventing them from making decisions about his medical care.

Kasem lives at home with his Jean, his wife of 33 years, and their adult daughter Liberty Jean.
