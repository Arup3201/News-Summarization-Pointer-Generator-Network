Fraudster: Emilio Brunetti, with his late father Antonio, paid his alcoholic neighbour to pose as his ailing father in a benefit fraud ploy

Having a neighbour with a drink problem wouldn’t be most people’s choice. But for benefit cheat Emilio Brunetti it proved rather rewarding.

He paid alcoholic Martin Rafferty £80 a time to pose as his ailing bedbound father when council officials called in.

The ruse helped him swindle more than £16,000 in benefits that were meant to fund care for his father – who was living in Brazil.

The fraudster even told council officials that the man purporting to be his father was unable to speak because he had just had a brain tumour removed.

When council investigators finally rumbled them, Rafferty, 62, had a ‘miracle recovery’, sat bolt upright in bed and said: ‘You got us’.

A magistrate yesterday warned Brunetti that he was likely to be jailed for his ‘calculated deception’ and ‘elaborate charade’.

Brunetti, 54, was granted power of attorney for his unwell father Antonio in April 2008 and started claiming housing benefit and council tax benefit in his name.

He was also given a housing association flat in Fulham in his father’s name. But neighbours reported last year they had not seen Antonio and believed he was either dead or abroad.

When council fraud officers visited the home for a scheduled meeting, they were greeted by Brunetti and a sleeping man in a wheelchair who he said was his father.

Brunetti said that he could not wake his father because he had taken strong medication.

Unconvinced, the investigators looked at CCTV footage from the front of the block of flats which showed the man claiming to be Antonio walking to his car unaided after the visit.

They then arranged a second visit on February 12 this year.

This time surveillance by fraud officers showed Brunetti arriving by car with an older man and walking into the property shortly before the meeting time.

Imposter: Martin Rafferty was paid to pose as Brunetti's ailing father

When the three investigators joined them, Brunetti showed them a bed-bound man wearing a woolly hat who he claimed was his father.

When they asked to talk to him, Brunetti said his father was unable to speak following the removal of  a brain tumour and, once again, told them he had consumed strong medication.

He also claimed his father had a live-in carer but said she was visiting a GP at the time of the visit.

When the investigators later returned with three officers from the Metropolitan Police and confronted the fraudsters with their surveillance, Rafferty confessed all.

A source in the case said: ‘He just sat right up and said, “OK, you’ve got us” and told us who he was. He knew the game was up.’

Brunetti admitted his father had left the UK in March 2012 and that he had paid Rafferty £80 a time to pretend to be his father on numerous occasions.

Antonio Brunetti has since died in Brazil. Brunetti had befriended Rafferty when he previously lived next door to him in West Kensington. He admitted four charges of fraud worth £16,400 at Hendon Magistrates’ Court.

Clive Lewisohn, chairman of the bench, ordered Brunetti and Rafferty, who admitted one charge of aiding and abetting a crime, to be committed to a crown court for sentencing.

He added: ‘Mr Brunetti is in a highly precarious position as far as his liberty is concerned.’

Hammersmith and Fulham Council deputy leader Greg Smith said: ‘Paying someone to pose as your dying father to cheat taxpayers is about as low as it gets.’
