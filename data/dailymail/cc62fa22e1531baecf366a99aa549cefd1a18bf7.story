Google could be facing two major hurdles as regulators in France and the US are believed to be preparing to hit out at the search giant.

The French data protection regulator, CNIL, will order the web giant to 'unravel'  data on users it pooled together from all of its products in March.

In the US, it has been reported that staff members at the Federal Trade 
Commission are preparing to recommend that the agency file an antitrust 
lawsuit against the search giant.

A double pronged attack: Google is expected to be told to 'unravel' the information pools on its users - as the US Federal Trade Commission is believed to be considering launching a massive antitrust suit

According to The Guardian, the French request relates to Google mixing information about how users behave on most of the firm's services, including Gmail and YouTube, to create a 'master profile' for each individual.

The move was originally designed to help tailor advertising to individuals' interests.

When it was revealed, it was heavily criticised and prompted an investigation by CNIL on behalf of privacy watchdogs across Europe -  the findings of which are due to be announced tomorrow.

Google said the move was aimed to 'streamline and simplify' its privacy policies.

However, users were only given the options of either accepting the new privacy policy, or shutting down their Google accounts.

CNIL is known as one of Europe's more
aggressive data protection authorities and is expected to order Google 
to separate out the data again.

Bradley Shears, a US-based lawyer, told the Guardian it could lead to global problems.

'The EU's decision may create a domino effect and lead regulators in the US and other parts of the world to impose similar restrictions on Google's ability to intermingle and monetise user data,' he told the paper.

However, Google could argue that the changes it made were technically irreversible, potentially sparking a fresh battle with European regulators.

The firm has been in negotiations with the European Commission for several months solutions to its alleged anti-competitive behaviour by promoting its own products ahead of rivals' in search results.

The search giant has faced repeated questions over its privacy and competition policies

The news comes as Federal regulators in the US as believed to be moving closer to suing Google over allegations that the company has abused its dominance of Internet search to stifle competition and drive up online advertising prices.

Several news outlets reported that staff members at the Federal Trade Commission are preparing to recommend that the agency file an antitrust lawsuit against the search giant.

A majority of the five FTC commissioners would have to approve a suit before legal action could proceed.

The reports from The New York Times, Bloomberg News and Reuters cited unnamed people briefed on the FTC's investigation.

FTC spokesman Peter Kaplan declined to comment.

The agency has been investigating Google's business practices.

The probe was triggered by complaints that Google Inc. has been highlighting its peripheral services in its influential search results and relegating offerings from its rivals to the back pages.

The FTC also has been looking into whether Google has rigged its results in a way that has prodded websites to pay more to promote their services through Google's advertising network.

In a statement Friday, Google said, 'We are happy to answer any questions that regulators have about our business.'

Google is based in Mountain View, Calif.
