These heart-stopping pictures show a group of teenage thrillseekers scaling a 300ft high crane - with one even hanging off by one hand.

The daredevil students spend their time free running around Brighton, climbing high buildings and leaping off urban obstacles, and reached their high point on the crane earlier this summer when they got into a building site near the train station.

But police today criticised their actions, warning the sport is 'extremely dangerous' and could cause serious injury or death.

Dangerous: Jake Deacon, 19, walked along the metal arm of the 300ft crane and hung off by one hand with no safety gear as part of thrillseeking sport free running

'Come back up now': Jack Bennett, 19, said: 'He was confident and went for it. I wouldn't say I was freaking out, but as soon as he did it I was like 'come back up now'

Daredevil Jake, 19, looks back at his friend and prepares to walk along the precarious edge of the crane's arm in the early hours of the morning

Selfie time: Despite the dangerous nature of the activity, the friends pose for a picture and don't appear to be holding on to anything for safety

 Police said free running, which is climbing up tall buildings and structures and jumping from one building to another, is extremely dangerous and cause serious injury

Don't look down: The daredevils, who do a lot of extreme sports, said they sneaked onto the building site to 'just overcome the challenge climbing the crane'

'Amazing view': They walked along the arm of the crane but said they didn't want to stay at the top for too long 'in case of getting spotted and worrying someone'

Jack Bennett, 19, filmed as he and three friends scaled the huge red rig at sunrise and Jake Deacon, 19, hung off the metal arm by one hand with no safety gear.

Jack, a graphic design student, said: 'We just did it for the view and the adventure.

'We went there early in the morning because we didn't want to disturb anyone. We didn't want anyone to see us and get worried.

'We all do a lot of extreme sports and wanted to just overcome the challenge of climbing the crane.

'The view was amazing. We decided to walk along the arm of the crane all the way to the end.

'This was the most exciting part, however we didn't want to stay up there too long in case of getting spotted and worrying someone.

'We could see the whole of Brighton - the sea, the wheel and the pier in the mid dawn light.

'Jake said he wanted to hang off. I would never do that, but he was confident and went for it. I wouldn't say I was freaking out, but as soon as he did it I was like 'come back up now'. 

Nervous: 'We don't plan on stopping urban climbing, parkour or free running any time soon. It was a great adventure, but we don't want to inspire anyone else to do this'

Ready to climb: Jake looks up in awe from the the bottom of the 300ft crane, which is the approximate height of a 30-storey building, before he begins his ascent

And another one: The sun begins to rise as the student takes a final picture of himself with the red rig in the background and prepares to climb the structure

'Crazy awesome': Jack said walking along the arm was the most exciting as 'we could see the whole of Brighton - the sea, the wheel and the pier in the mid dawn light'

Police warn free running could cause serious injury to others on the ground if there is damage to the structure and tiles, masonry and other items are dislodged and fall'

Jack filmed as he and his friends sneaked on to the building site near a train station in Brighton earlier this summer and scaled the huge red crane to watch the sunrise

'We were up there for five or ten minutes and then came down. We headed home on a huge high after a crazy awesome adventure.

'We all had work the next day, so had a great story all to share. We don't plan on stopping urban climbing, parkour or free running any time soon.

'It was a great adventure, but we don't want to inspire anyone else to do this.'

Sussex Police said that, while scaling the crane is not a crime, criminal offences - like criminal damage or antisocial behaviour - could be committed while doing it. 

A police spokeswoman said: 'Free running, which is climbing up tall buildings and structures and jumping from one building to another, is extremely dangerous and can result in serious injury or death. 

'It could also injure somebody on the ground if the free running causes damage to the structure as tiles, masonry and other items may be dislodged and fall.' 

The thrillseeking students sneaked onto the building site near Brighton train station in the early hours of the morning in June this year in a bid to avoid detection
