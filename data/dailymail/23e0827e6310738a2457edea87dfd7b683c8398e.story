Loss: Haven Lee Norton, 10, was run over by a school bus outside his home on Monday morning

A distraught mother has described the horrifying moment she watched helplessly as her 10-year-old son tripped and fell in front of his school bus before he was fatally hit.

Haven Lee Norton left his home in Springtown, Texas at around 6.30am on Monday to catch the bus to school as his mother, Shannon Norton, watched from the house.

But as Haven neared the bus, which was collecting another child across the street, he tripped and fell and was not spotted by the driver. The vehicle took off before he had a chance to get out of the way.

'I saw him slip,' his mother told the Star Telegram. 'He hollered, but [the bus] started rolling and [the driver] had taken her foot off the brake. He tried to get out of the way. He hollered, and I hollered.

'Then he went silent.'

Haven, who loved to play outdoors, go
fishing and attend school with his friends, according to his family, 
was pronounced dead at the scene.

The bus driver, who has been working 
with the district for two years, usually has her window down so that she
can talk with parents, but the window was up, the newspaper reported.

'If she had her window down, she would have been able to hear,' Shannon Norton said.

Horror: Haven's mother Shannon, pictured with her son and daughter, watched helplessly as her son was hit

'I put my kid on that bus in her 
possession. It's her job to protect my children and she took my child’s 
life because she wasn’t aware of her surroundings.'

Department of Public Safety trooper 
Gary Rozzell said the woman, who has not been identified, did not see 
the boy as she drove off.

'The woman bus driver stopped the bus and activated the lights,' he said.

'The boy came up beside the bus as 
she deactivated the lights. The bus started to pull forward and the boy 
couldn't get out of the way, and was struck by the left front of the 
vehicle.'

Springtown school district 
Superintendent Mike Kelley said she has been put on administrative leave
as the incident is investigated. He said he did not know when she would
be back at work.

Investigation: The bus driver, who did not see Haven in the road, has been put on administrative leave

Scene: Haven was heading to catch the bus outside his home on this rural Texas street

Tragedy: Investigators are looking into why the driver failed to spot the young boy as he crossed the road

The driver voluntarily submitted to drug and alcohol testing following the accident, but the results of the tests have not been released.

Investigators found that the lights and brakes were working properly. At the time of the accident, she was onboard the bus with four children and another driver.

Haven, who was in fourth grade at Springtown Elementary School, had only been riding the bus for two weeks after the family's car broke down.

His family said they hoped to spread his ashes in California, where he grew up.
