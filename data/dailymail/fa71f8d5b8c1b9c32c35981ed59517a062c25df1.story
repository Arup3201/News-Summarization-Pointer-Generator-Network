An Oxford graduate has been jailed for three years in Italy for killing his friend in a 120mph crash while drink-driving.

Ryon James Heyn, 26, had sped off from a petrol station without paying shortly before smashing his mother's Mercedes into a truck, killing passenger Stefano Annoni, 35.

Pictures of the crash show the car was so badly crumpled, it was barely recognisable.

Heyn was jailed for three years and four months for causing the death of his friend after driving over 120mph while under the influence of alcohol and without a proper driving licence.

He had been travelling back from Italy to Austria, where he worked, when he stopped at a petrol station near Venice on August 11 this year.

But instead of paying for petrol, the pair jumped into the car and sped off.

The Mercedes A-class was owned by Heyn's mother and had been taken without permission from his stepfather earlier in the day, the court heard.

They had crashed a short while after leaving the petrol station when the car hit a truck.

Police were already on the way to arrest the pair after the petrol station manager had raised the alarm.

Heyn, who moved to Europe this year and had a home in Lecco, a city in northern Italy, worked for an Austrian company.

He was also ordered to pay a fine of 1,400 Euro (£1,108) for drink-driving and refusing a breath test.

He was not charged over the theft of petrol after paying compensation to the garage.
