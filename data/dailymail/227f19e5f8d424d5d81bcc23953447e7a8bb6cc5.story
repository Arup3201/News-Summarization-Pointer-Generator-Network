Hollywood actress Drew Barrymore has reached out to her extended family following the death of her half-sister in a suspected suicide saying she was 'incredibly sorry' for their loss.

Jessica Barrymore, 47, was 'found dead' on the eve of her birthday in her car in National City, just north of San Diego, on Tuesday about 6am. She had apparently visited her mother earlier in the day.

Drew, 39, released a statement today saying: 'Although I only met her briefly, I wish her and her loved ones as much peace as possible and I’m so incredibly sorry for their loss.'

It has been reported that numerous white pills were scattered on the passenger seat of her car.

Marta Lopez made the discovery when she tried to leave for work but was blocked in her driveway by Ms Barrymore's car, 10News reported.

She unsuccessfully tried to wake Ms Barrymore, who was to turn 48 tomorrow, and asked if she needed help, before noticing the pill bottles and calling the police. 

Those living near where her body was discovered said her car had been parked there since about midnight.

Ms Barrymore's cause of death is yet to be determined, but an autopsy is scheduled.

Ms Barrymore is the daughter of actor 
John Drew Barrymore – who is also the father of the Charlie's Angels 
actress – and his third wife Nina Wayne.

Although Jessica's immediate family are yet to comment on the death, condolences have been offered to the family via her brother John Barrymore's Facebook page.

Arlene August wrote that Jessica had visited her mother on Monday, the day before she died.

'Sad day for my dear friend Nina Wayne. Her daughter Jessica Barrymore is no longer with us. Nina was visited by Jessica yesterday.

'Today I learned of her passing, and relayed the news to John Barrymore via the phone. Prayers for peace and clean grieving go out to family and friends from myself, my church members of Congressional UCC Klamath Falls, Oregon, as well as Debra Lee Harpham.'

Hugh Tiny Hogg wrote: 'My condolences on your loss John, a tragedy.'

Another wrote: 'So sad to lose family, RIP, Jessica.'

According to Ms Barrymore's Facebook page she attended the San Diego School of Creative Arts and lives in San Marcos.

Ms Barrymore's final post on her Facebook page was a quote she shared from Mystera Magazine

In a cryptic last message on her profile page on July 28, Ms Barrymore shared a post from Mystera Magazine that said: 'Life doesn't always introduce you to the people you want to meet.

'Sometimes,life puts you in touch with the people you need to meet to Help You, to Hurt You, to Guide You, to Leave You, to Love You, and to gradually Strengthen You into the Person You Were Meant to Become.'

Jessica’s posts on Facebook also give an insight into her life as a spiritual person. Five days ago she posted a prayer from a book with the title: ‘I forgive and I am forgiven.’.

It read: 'The moment I forgive I am receptive to divine forgiveness. This is the promise of the wisest sages and a spiritual truth I live every day'.

There are quotes from Nelson Mandela, Mother Theresa and Aristotle which show she took a philosophical approach to life.

One of Hollywood's most famous child stars, Drew Barrymore had a well-documented battle with drugs and alcohol in her teenage years and has often spoken about her strained family life. 

In her autobiography Little Girl Lost, published when she was 14, Drew wrote, ‘I had my first drink at age nine, began smoking marijuana at ten and at 12 took up cocaine.’

By 13 she was in rehab and following a suicide attempt and a further stint in rehab, at 15 she successfully petitioned for emancipation from her parents.

Her father John was an alcoholic and abandoned Drew and her mother when she was a baby and was in and out of jail on drugs charges before he died of cancer.

And her mother Jaid, who struggled as an actress, took her to nightclubs when she was just eight, and to auditions before she was a year old. Drew has described the relationship as 'my greatest battle'.

And the Barrymore's relationship with substance abuse doesn't end there. Drew's grandfather, the legendary actor John Barrymore, died from alcohol-related cirrhosis of the liver aged 60.
