A mother-of-three was shamed into losing more than 15 stone after she wasn't able to take a dream hot air balloon flight because she was too heavy.

Jane Qualtrough was mortified when she couldn't take the trip while on holiday in Australia with her daughters three years ago because her 27-and-a-half-stone weight meant the balloon would be unable to take off.

Her size was further brought home to her when she saw a holiday snap from the occasion which made her look bigger than one of the massive inflatable balloons.

'It was humiliating. There's a photo of me at that time with the balloon in the background. I was Hot Air Balloon Mum,' she said.

The experience prompted Jane, 48, to overhaul her lifestyle and she became determined to lose weight and regain her life.

'I took a long hard look at myself and couldn't believe how far I'd slipped. Instead of eating burgers I switched to salads and joined a gym,' she explained.

Transformed: Jane is now 12 stone and dress size 14, left, after taking up exercise and eating healthily. She previously weighed 27st 7lb and was a dress size 36

Jane's weigh rose to 27st 7lb and a dress size 36 after she split with the father of her three children, Joshua, 23, Jasmine, 20, and Maxine, 18, in 1995.

Her weight had a huge impact on her confidence and made her feel unsexy and 'ready for death'.

'I was such a big fat blob having sex was the last thing on my mind,' she said. 'I was having a destructive love affair with food and used to gorge on biscuits and ice-cream in front of the TV. I hated myself and was ready for death.

Wake-up call: It was holiday snaps like this one from her trip to Australia which made Jane realise how big she had become

'My clothes all came from Premier Man because I couldn't find nice things in my size. I didn't care what I looked like anymore. I had stopped looking in the mirror or wearing make-up.'

On a typical day, the nurse from Port Erin on the Isle of Man would eat six pieces of 
buttery toast or a big fry up for breakfast; two portions of bolognese for lunch and a massive takeaway curry for dinner.

But thanks to eating more healthily and taking up exercise, she lost an incredible 15 stone in 14 months.

Her trimmer figure also gave her more confidence, leading her to meet the man of her dreams - and have sex for the first time in 12 years.

New love: The nurse piled on the pounds after splitting from the father of her children but after losing 15 stone has found happiness with boyfriend Barry, right

Now a slim 12 stone and a size 14, Jane says she has an amazing sex life with new man Barry Uran, 45, who she met last August.

'I have a fabulous man now and I have never been happier,' she said. 'I can't keep my hands off him and he tells me I'm gorgeous all the time. Barry has even said to me, "give me a break, I'm worn out", but I can't help it, he's so lovely.

'I feel 18 again and must be the luckiest girl in the world. Four years ago I was ready for death and now my life's only just beginning.'

More energy: The mother has never felt sexier since giving up fatty foods and meeting Barry
