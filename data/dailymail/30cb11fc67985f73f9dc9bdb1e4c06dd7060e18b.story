Since ousting a group of parents at her daughter's school for requesting donations towards expensive birthday gifts Myleene Klass has been the subject of playground chatter across the UK. 

And while some may have criticised her choice to upload a photograph of the email exchange to social media, the radio DJ says she has been secretly inundated with messages of support.

It comes after the mother-of-two was harangued by angry mothers at the gates of her daughter's north London school yesterday. 

Outraged parents were seen shouting across the playground: 'Why did you do it Myleene,' seemingly irate with her decision to share the conversation with her thousands of fans.

Myleene Klass, (pictured yesterday, left) said she has been inundated with messages of support since revealing the exchange with mothers at her daughter's school. The 36-year-old has two daughters, Ava and Hero (together, right)

But some have been secretly glad to see the issue raised publically, Miss Klass, 36, said today. 

'My phone hasn't stopped ringing since. The reactions have been mostly positive, with lots of parents laughing it off and thanking me for speaking out. 

'When the email was initially sent out, at least 10 parents "secretly" got in touch to say they wished they too could confront the situation,' Miss Klass wrote in an article for the Daily Telegraph. 

Far from trying to embarrass the women involved, the classical singer said she was trying to 'put the fun back into birthdays' by posting the exchange on Instagram. 

The conversation was is in fact a year old, she said, and was only used after the issue of how much should be spent on a child's birthday was raised in her close circle of friends. 

'Though they were old exchanges, I've received countless emails like this since. 

Mockery: Ms Klass posted the text of two emails she received from fellow parents, as well as her response

The 36-year-old Classic FM presenter said she did not want to embarrass the mothers involved so uploaded an old email exchange in which all the names had been changed

Miss Klass added she had been trying to 'put the fun back into birthdays' when she shared her joking response in which she told mothers she was planning to buy Ava, 7, (right) a unicorn

'I didn't want to embarrass the parents involved, so I used some old emails that were less recognisable and changed the names of everyone involved,' she added. 

In the emails, the parents of two girls asked others at the school whether they would like to contribute £10 each for a Kindle and a desk as birthday gifts. 

Mothers were invited to place the cash in envelopes and in their own children's schoolbags to pass along. 

Responding to the request, Miss Klass poked fun at the entire exchange by joking she was raising money to buy her daughter Ava a unicorn. 

'I'd like a Ferrari and Leonardo DiCaprio, so by all means, do feel obligated to contribute to this too,' she added. 

While social media was abuzz with messages of support, others failed to see the funny side. 

One mother at the school described her actions as 'a cheap shot,' while another said the celebrity had alienated herself. 

'She has betrayed our confidences and belittled us so publicly. Lots of people have complained,' the woman, who did not want to be named, said. 

Others wrote letters of complaint to the school's headteacher. Miss Klass declined to comment yesterday on such reports.
