Women should freeze their eggs when they hit 30 as an ‘insurance policy’ for having babies later on, according to researchers.

Anyone who hasn’t met Mr Right - or is intent on pursuing their career -should consider paying up to £5,000 to ‘bank’ their eggs.

Not only will their chances of having babies be higher, say researchers from the US Government, they will also save money as they won’t have to pay for IVF later in life.

Women who freeze their eggs at 30 and have them reinserted ten years later are five times more likely to get pregnant

In Britain, the cost of removing and freezing a woman’s eggs can be as high as £5,000 in addition to an annual fee of £200 for every year they are stored.

But the academics have calculated that if women wait until they are 40 before trying for children, they may need several rounds of IVF which will cost double this amount.

And by this stage there is no guarantee they will ever become pregnant - even with IVF - as their eggs are of far poorer quality.

The researchers claim if these women were to freeze their eggs aged 30 and then have them re-inserted ten years later, their chances of having a baby would be five times greater.

The experts have worked out that a 40-year-old woman who uses eggs frozen when she was 30 has a 75 per cent chance of falling pregnant.

This compares to a 40-year-old on IVF who has less than a 15 per cent chance.

At present very few women in Britain bank their eggs unless they are about to undergo cancer treatment

Dr Kate Devine, from the National Institutes of Health, the research agency of the US’s Department of Health, said: ‘You take a 30-year-old lawyer - she knows that she wants children someday but she’s getting concerned because she knows that ten years goes by before she’s in that position.

‘So her options at that point are to freeze eggs or not to freeze eggs.’

Addressing the American Society for Reproductive Medicine’s conference in San Diego, she added: 

‘If you’re sure you’re not going to get pregnant until you’re 40, the younger the better.

‘So long as you freeze your eggs before 35 you have a 75 per cent chance of having a live birth.’

But she added that if a woman ‘took her chances’ and waited until she was 40 to try for a baby, she may need several cycles of IVF - each costing at least £3,000  - before she was successful.

At present very few women in Britain bank their eggs unless they are about to undergo cancer treatment as it can damage their reproductive system.

The process involves them firstly being given high doses hormones –  called gonadotropins – to stimulate their ovaries and make them produce high numbers of eggs.

Once the eggs have reached a certain size, they are removed via a fine needle and placed in liquid nitrogen which freezes them at -196 C (-320F).

Normally between 10 and 12 eggs are stored at a time – by law in Britain they can only be kept for a maximum of ten years.

But the procedure is relatively new in Britain and only a handful of babies have been born from frozen eggs – the first was in 2002.

The exact numbers are not known but it is believed to be fewer than ten.

Nonetheless research shows that rising numbers of women in their 20s and 30s are considering the option.

A woman undergoing IVF treatment at 40 has less than 1 15 per cent chance of getting pregnant

Only last month a poll of 3,000 women aged 28 to 45 by Red magazine found a fifth had considered freezing their eggs for use later on.

Oxford academic Dr Dagan Wells backed the idea and said women were increasingly waiting until their late 30s before trying for a baby.

By the time they realised they need IVF they may well be 40 by which time success rates are ‘really low’ he added.

Josaphine Quintavalle, of the group Comment on Reproductive Ethics warned that in rare cases, egg freezing can cause fatal blood clots.

She said: ‘Egg harvesting is a very uncomfortable invasive process, and can actually go seriously wrong.

‘Keep searching is my advice and spend the money on finding Mr Right rather than enriching the IVF providers.’

Dr Devine added that some women would never need to use their frozen eggs as they may decide to have babies a couple of years later-having met Mr Right or deciding to put career on hold.

‘Obviously some women will never need to use their eggs. This is just an insurance policy of sorts.’

At a cost of £5,000, it could work out cheaper than IVF which has a much lower success rate

The practice if relatively new in Britain - with less than 10 babies conceived from a frozen egg
