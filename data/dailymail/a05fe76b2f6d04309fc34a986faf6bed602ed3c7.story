A man caught by a high-tech police trap that turned his arms and face bright green under ultra-violet light has been convicted of stealing from a car.

Yafet Askale, 28, was sentenced to a community order yesterday after being marked by a SmartWater anti-theft device in a booby-trapped car set up by police.

He broke into the vehicle, which was left in Harlesden, northwest London, and was later found by police with items stolen from inside, including a laptop.

Marked man: Yafet Askale, 28, was found guilty of theft from a motor vehicle after falling from a trap set in northwest London

Officers knew to hunt him down after the system automatically alerted them to the theft on June 10 this year, and ultra-violet scans showed that his face and jacket were heavily marked with the liquid.

He pleaded not guilty before magistrates but was found guilty of theft from a motor vehicle, and sentenced to 49 hours of community work and £400 costs.

SmartWater systems are currently on trial by Brent Police in the area, and have been used on vulnerable houses and cars in the area to deter thieves - and help catch them if they strike anyway.

The devices can detect intruders, and spray them automatically with a fine mist of the substance, which is marked with a combination of chemicals that enables police to link people to a particular incident. 

Facing up to justice: He received 49 hours of community work, and had to pay £400 costs, for the theft, which saw him take items including a laptop computer

Revealed: But under UV light the impossible-to-remove liquid shows itself

The substances contained in SmartWater - which is odourless and invisible to the naked eye - are almost impossible to wash out of clothes, and can stay on the skin for weeks.

Local people in Harlesden have been given free kits by police to mark their own valuables, which has led to a 40 percent reduction in street robbery and an 80 percent reduction in burglary.

Detective Inspector Madeline Ryder said: 'This is another excellent example of the thorough work completed by Brent Officers. Using the trap car technology, we were able to charge Askale and put him before the courts.

'The trap car forms part of an overall crime reduction strategy designed by SmartWater, which is an effective weapon in the armoury of tools that we routinely use in Brent. We will continue to target those who are insistent on committing these types of offence.'

'Brent Police say very clearly to any would-be thieves: "Don't come to Brent - our trap cars and trap houses are waiting for you."'
