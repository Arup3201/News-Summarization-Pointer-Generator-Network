A 25-year-old writer who was dumped this week via text - after two only dates - has revealed how she sought to exact revenge by contacting the man's workplace and complaining that he'd sent her sexting messages using his company Blackberry.

Not content with reporting him to his boss, Quin Woodward Pu also blogged about her experience – a decision that has backfired spectacularly judging from the amount of scorn she has received on countless social media forums since revealing her cruel act of revenge.

Describing herself as 'The Taylor Swift of literature' and 'a straight-A Asian-American extrovert from Georgia with a penchant for vodka, designer shoes and older men,’ Washington D.C.-based Woodward Pu clearly isn’t lacking in confidence although she does lack some self-awareness.

A recent blog post by Quin Woodward Pu has earned her a host of negative replies after she revealed her childish reaction to being dumped by a man she had only met twice

She's the editor-in-chief of Little Black Blog, a website filled with lots of words and pictures devoted to her favorite subject - Quin Woodward Pu.

In a blog posted entitled ‘I’m 26 What’s a filter?’ posted on Tuesday she wrote of how two weeks ago she met a random man in a bar.

‘He was friendly enough, but annoyingly and sloppily drunk, which is why I offered my email address when he asked for my number. We emailed later that weekend, and I met up for a few drinks, which eventually turned to dinner, and then champagne.

'We had relatively good chemistry, but then, I kinda have chemistry with pretty much everyone, because I really like talking to people and winning over complete strangers,’ she wrote.

The pair had a second date last weekend, which went so well that Woodward Pu decided to invite the man to her upcoming 26th birthday party, taking place this weekend, to which she has invited her closest 125 friends.

‘He wouldn’t be in town, so he scheduled a weekend in Virginia wine country the following weekend,’ she wrote. ‘It seemed a bit much, but I agreed to a singular day trip.’

But before things could get more serious, Woodward Pu received a text from her prospective boyfriend the next day in which he unceremoniously dumped her in a rather weaselly fashion.

In his text, the man - whose name she doesn't disclose - gives her that most cliched of breakup lines that he isn’t ‘looking for a relationship’ and that he has ‘no doubt you’ll move on quickly as you are a funny, smart, cool girl!’

Woodward Pu writes of how her surprise quickly turned to fury on receiving the message.

Woodward Pu's two books - 'A+' and 'Digfast' are in fact self-published tomes of her own autobiography which have received a host of negatives reviews on Amazon

‘I was stunned into paralysis. I had no words – this never happens – and I just felt short of breath.

'There were many things that pissed me off, but I was so flustered I couldn’t even articulate them. Again, this is a serious problem for a writer and effusive communicator.

‘I was still so agitated 10 hours later that I had to leave opera rehearsal early. This is a serious no-no, given that opening night is Saturday at the Organization of American States.

‘Then I realized: I am on the eve of my 26th birthday. Why am I stewing instead of just expressing what I really feel? There is practically nothing to lose from just telling the truth.’

Next, Woodward Pu revealed how she decided to exact her childish revenge - by sending screen shots of sexting messages they had exchanged to his superiors. She justified her actions because he had sent the messages from his 'taxpayer-funded' work Blackberry.

In her blog she claims her actions were a feminist act for ‘you, and your girlfriends, moms, grandmothers, daughters, etc’ because women should ‘never remain silent in the bombastic, outrageously chauvinistic face of an insecure man.’

If Woodward Pu thought that revealing her over-the-top act of revenge was going to win her plaudits for being a 'strong, independent woman,' she had sorely misjudged her public.

Instead of praise she has attracted a host of negative comments accusing her of being a vain, insecure narcissist.

'This woman is SHAMEFUL! The irony is this blog post was suppose to make her look like some kind of "hero" when really it makes her the villain in this situation. She needs to grow up. She should be thankful that this man was honest with her, and tried to move on in an adult manner.

'I don’t know why she’s even dating, as she’s clearly not mature enough to be in a relationship. This woman makes us all look bad,' wrote Quinisababy.

Woodward Pu's pompous self-aggrandized claim to be ‘a 25 year old with two published books and a condo' has won her few fans and a whole host of enemies.

One commenter, Michael, wrote: 'Despite her claim to feminist righteousness, I think she’s undermining the very cause she purports to support by confusing public vs private issues and using a movement to justify her poorly-formed emotional-coping skills.'

Her two books - 'A+' and 'Digfast' - it turns out are self-published tomes of her own autobiography. Both are available via Amazon where they too have attracted a great deal of scorn.

'This girl has problems. She is narcissistic and pretentious,' wrote Mr Dude.

'The author is in live with herself, despite her complete lack of any real accomplishments (no, your trendy Sex and the City lifestyle doesn't count) or personal likeability,' wrote KTW.

'How narcissistic do you have to be to self-publish two memoirs by age 26 without having done anything of note,' wrote Why?

It isn’t clear what has happened to her unnamed ex. The sexting messages are unlikely to cause him more than some embarrassment in front of his boss - or his boss might tell him he has had a lucky escape from Miss Woodward Pu.
