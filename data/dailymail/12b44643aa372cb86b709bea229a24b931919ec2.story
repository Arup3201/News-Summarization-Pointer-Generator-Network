The real Slim Shady has been located - at her sister's wedding in California.

Rivaling America's favorite bridesmaid, Kristen Wig, maid of honor Jennifer Gabrielli bust out a seriously impressive rap after her sister, Nicole's, nuptials on Saturday to the tune of Eminem's 'Without Me.'

The spectacular speech begins as any other, with Jennifer explaining to the crowd how she fits in to the bridal party. But then the Eminem beat drops, she dons a black hoodie over her pretty blue bridesmaid dress, and she's off.

Jokes: Jennifer jokes in the rap about how she and her big sister used to chill in their pajamas until Blake kept hanging around

'Two lovers in love walk down the aisle, down the aisle, down the aisle,' she begins, before introducing the couple: 'Guess who's here to get wed, Nicole and Blake, so clap your hands.'

As she launches into the chorus, the wedding guests, gathered at the La Costa Resort, go wild.

'This looks like it's meant to be so everybody just toast with me raise your glasses if you're thirsty because tonight we're here to par-party,' she raps.

Jennifer jokes in the rap about how 
she and her big sister used to chill in their pajamas until Blake kept 
hanging around. She also jokes about how the couple didn't want her as 
their third roomie.

But she gave the groom her seal of approval.

'Blake,
he don't wanna get his but kicked. Toilet seat down and he does the 
dishes,' she sang, before rapping a few verses about the couple's future
life together.

Laughing: The bride and groom couldn't help but chuckle during the rap toast

Eminem: The impressive rap came after her sister, Nicole's, nuptials on Saturday and went to the tune of Eminem's 'Without Me'

Mom: The girls' mom, Barb, pictured, is clearly enjoying the rendition

'Guaranteed you'll grow that family tree, pretty cute babies we can all agree. You know Nicole wants 30 or more, too much to pay for so Blake said four.

'Just give me some neices and nephews, so Barb (the girls' mom) doesn't fall to pieces.'

The crowd are clearly blown away by the epic maid of honor speech, and even Jennifer, not-so-humbly, praises the effort.

'And while I'm not the first to congratulate ya, I have the best toast since God the Father. I want you both to know I love ya and without warning I'll pop on over.'

Babies: 'Guaranteed you'll grow that family tree, pretty cute babies we can all agree. You know Nicole wants 30 or more, too much to pay for so Blake said four,' she rapped

Raise your glass: The newlyweds and their guests raised their glasses as requested by the rapper
