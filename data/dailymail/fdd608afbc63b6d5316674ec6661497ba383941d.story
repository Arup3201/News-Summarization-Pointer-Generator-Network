More than a third of Americans will watch TV between 8 and 9pm today, while only 8 per cent of the country will spend the same hour doing household chores, and 7 per cent of the country is still at work. 

That is according to an hourly breakdown of the federal government's American Time Use Survey produced by e-commerce company Retale. 

The company took the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics recent study of how Americans use their time to produce a breakdown of what every American is doing at a given hour.

The average American: This graph produced by Retale shows an aggregation of how every American spends their time according the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The red areas indicate time at work, the green leisure activities, the purple household activities and the dark blue is sleeping  

Working eight to five: This graph represents how employed Americans spend their time and shows most people still work conventional hours

It shows that the average American still works between the hours of 8am to 5pm from Monday to Friday, and spends his or her evenings doing household chores or watching TV.

However the statistics show that Americans are working an average of ten minutes less per day than in 2003, and spend more time sleeping. 

Other key findings from the Bureau of Labor Statistics survey included that the average employed American spends 7.6 hours at work every week day, while on an average day just 19 per cent of men did housework. 

Almost every American finds time in their day for a leisure activity - with th emost popular by far being watching TV.

Most Americans wake up between six and eight am on a working day and go to sleep between ten pm and midnight. 

 

Men: This graph representing how men spend their time shows that the average man spends twice as much time on sport and exercise as women
