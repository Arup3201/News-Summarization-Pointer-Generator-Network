Michael Brown, 18, was shot dead on Saturday by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. Hacker group Anonymous have reportedly released some 911 dispatch calls around the time of his death 

Hacktivist collective Anonymous had a Twitter account suspended today after they named the wrong police officer in the Michael Brown cop shooting. 

Police told NBC that the person who Anonymous had named online is a dispatcher and was not involved in the Ferguson shooting on Saturday. 

In a comment today to MailOnline, a Twitter spokesperson said: 'We do not comment on individual accounts, for privacy an security reasons.'

Twitter rules state: 'You may not publish or post other people's private and confidential information, such as credit card numbers, street address or Social Security/National Identity numbers, without their express authorization and permission.'

Anonymous was now tweeting about Ferguson under a secondary account, @TheAnonMessage2. 

On Wednesday, the hackers apparently released St Louis police dispatch tapes which reveal further details surrounding the cop shooting death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown.

The computer hackers' collective posted two hours of the 911 calls online.

On the tape, time-stamped between 12.05pm-12.35pm, a person, believed to be a dispatcher can be heard referring to an incident in Ferguson, Missouri. Additional squad cars were being requested from Ferguson Police Department for crowd control.

With details unclear, the dispatcher revealed she has heard 'on the news' that actually it appears to be an 'officer involved shooting'. 

The dispatcher added that when she called Ferguson Police Department 'they don't know a thing about it'.

About ten minutes into the two-hour recording, the dispatcher allegedly said: 'Ferguson is asking for assistance with crowd control... asking for [unclear] officer respond, can I send one?'

She then added: 'They just told me they needed assistance on crowd control on Canfield and Coppercreek.' 

Around a minute later, the St Louis dispatcher said: 'She just said that they have a large group gathering there, she didn't know anything further.'

Seconds later, the dispatcher said: 'We just got another call saying there was an officer involved shooting at Canfield and Coppercreek. I don't know who called it in but it was called into my desk.'

A dispatcher then added: 'Be advised, this information came from the news.' 

The dispatcher then orders another St Louis squad car to the scene.

A dispatcher then says: 'We just got the information from the news and we called Ferguson back again but they don't know anything about it.' 

A number of squad car numbers are then read out. The dispatcher appears to address one car: '2121 let me know what they have there, as soon as you get there.'

Around a minute later, a dispatcher asked: 'You arrived on something, what were you arriving at? 

A few minutes pass with calls to other emergencies but the St Louis dispatchers continue to check in with their responding officers.

One dispatcher said: 'If you need me to [unclear] at any point, I don't know if Ferguson is going to do that.'

The intersection referred to on the tapes is close to the spot where Brown, 18, was shot dead by a Ferguson police office on Saturday.

 

The release of the dispatch tapes comes after Anonymous earlier threatened to launch an online attack on police departments over alleged brutality in the killing of the teenager.

Hacker collective Anonymous claimed today to have released St Louis' 911 dispatch tapes. The supposed details on the cop shooting in Ferguson are interspersed with other emergency calls. A basic transcript of elements of the call are below.  

Dispatcher (D): 'Ferguson is asking for assistance with crowd control... asking for [unclear] officer respond, can I send one?'

D: 'They just told me they needed assistance on crowd control on Canfield and Coppercreek.'

D: 'She just said that they have a large group gathering there, she didn't know anything further.'

D: 'We just got another call saying there was an officer involved shooting at Canfield and Coppercreek. I don't know who called it in but it was called into my desk.'

D: 'Be advised, this information came from the news.'

The dispatcher then orders another St Louis squad car to the scene. 

D: 'We just got the information from the news and we called Ferguson back again but they don't know anything about it.'

A number of squad car numbers then appear to be read out. 

The dispatcher appears to address one car: '2121 let me know what they have there, as soon as you get there.'

Around a minute later, a dispatcher asked: 'You arrived on something, what were you arriving at? 

A few minutes pass with calls to other emergencies but the St Louis dispatchers continue to check in with their responding officers.

One dispatcher said: 'If you need me to [unclear] at any point, I don't know if Ferguson is going to do that.'

Police have cracked down hard on demonstrators in Ferguson, a suburb of St Louis, who took to the streets after the 18-year-old was shot dead.

Despite calls for calm, officers fired tear gas and shot at least one person in a third night of rioting in the area on Tuesday. Police claimed the man shot had pulled a handgun on an officer.

As police tried to put the area on lock-down, messages posted on a newly-established Twitter account called Operation Ferguson, which appeared to be linked to Anonymous, announced: 'We have a deep source, and we have a name we BELIEVE to be the shooter [of Michael Brown]. It does NOT match any of the names being floated.

'We have our best operatives working as hard as they can to verify the leak on the shooter we were passed. PLEASE be patient.

'When we release the name of Mike Brown's killer, it will be in an unequivocal statement released through this Twitter account. No games.'

A little later another message suggested that the operation was proving more difficult than anticipated.

'To my fellow Anons, everyone remain chill,' it read. 'I realize this is an intense Op, and we are all trying our best. Let's fight cops not each other.'

There has been anger from the teenager's parents and their supporters after the Ferguson Police Department decided not to publish the name of the officer who shot their son.

At a rally in Ferguson on Tuesday, his mother, Lesley McSpadden, told the policeman who fired the shots: 'You take your punishment. If you were a man you'd stand up, you'd be a man, you would say you was wrong.'

Police have not disclosed the race of the officer, but witnesses said he was white.

The Ferguson police force has 53 officers, three of whom are black. About two-thirds of Ferguson's population of about 21,000 are black, according to U.S. Census figures.

In a video posted on Sunday night, a self-declared spokesman for Anonymous warned Missouri police 'we are watching you very closely'.

'If you abuse, harass or harm in any way the protesters in Ferguson we will take every web-based asset of your departments and governments offline,' said a disguised voice, speaking over news footage of protests.

'That's not a threat, it is a promise.'

In the video and a press release posted to the Pastebin website, the video says Anonymous will 'attack ever server and computer' belonging to the police departments involved, as well as 'release the personal information on every single member of the Ferguson Police Department, as well as any other jurisdiction that participates in the abuse.' 

Police officers keep watch while demonstrators protest the death of black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri on Tuesday night. Hackers' collective Anonymous has warned that it will punish acts of police brutality 

'We will seize all your databases and E-Mail spools and dump them on the Internet,' it said. 'This is your only warning.'

There was no immediate way to verify the video was genuine or that any attacks or hacks have been effective.

However an officer in the records department at Ferguson Police Department told MailOnline today that emails could not be sent because their system had been taken down. This remark could not be confirmed by the police department spokesman on Wednesday. 

Investigators have released few details about what they believe happened when Mr Brown was shot, saying only that a scuffle unfolded after the officer asked Michael and another teen to get out of the street on Saturday afternoon.

At some point, the officer's weapon fired inside a patrol car, according to the St Louis County Police Department, which is handling the investigation at the smaller city's request.

The fullest account of Michael's death so far has come from Dorian Johnson, who said he was walking home with Michael when they were approached by an officer in a squad car who ordered them to move to the sidewalk.

Mr Johnson told news crews that he and Brown kept walking and the officer then reversed his car 'to where it almost hit us.'

The officer, Mr Johnson said, tried to open his door, but it 'ricocheted' back.

Mr Johnson said the officer reached through the window, 'grabbed my friend around the neck' and tried to pull him into the car.

The officer then pulled out his gun and said, '"I'll shoot you' or "I'm going to shoot",' Mr Johnson said.

When the officer opened fire, Mr Brown was hit, said Mr Johnson, who hid behind a car. 

Mr Brown began running, Mr Johnson said. Mr Johnson said the officer pursued Mr Brown and fired again.

When Mr Brown felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air and started to get down on the ground. The officer kept firing, Mr Johnson said.

Mr Brown had just graduated from high school and was set to begin at technical college on Monday.
