Darren Weatherston, 33, from Byker, Newcastle, tortured and stabbed his girlfriend during a frightening two-hour ordeal

A manipulative boyfriend smeared butter and orange juice in his girlfriend's face before torturing and stabbing her during a horrific two-hour attack.

Darren Weatherston, from Byker, Newcastle, warned Crystal Dixon she would need a 'closed casket' by the time he had finished with her.

He then stabbed her in the neck with a fork, before using a Stanley knife to stab her in the thigh.

The 33-year-old also threatened to give Miss Dixon a 'Chelsea smile' - a cut from the ears to the lips.

Weatherston was jailed at Newcastle Crown Court for four-and-a-half years after pleading guilty to making a threat to kill, wounding with intent, false imprisonment and witness intimidation.

The court heard how Weatherston threatened to torture Miss Dixon 'until the night is out'. He also told her she would have to urinate herself when she needed the toilet.

When she tried to flee the flat where she was being held, Weatherston chased after her, holding a knife to her throat as he led her back.

It was only when two strangers walked past and punched Weatherston to the ground that Miss Dixon was able to escape. 

Judge John Evans said: 'You are a danger to the public, essentially people with whom you form a close relationship. That is a danger I have to address.

'There is no doubt that your behaviour on that day was appalling and she was terrified as a result.'

The court heard the attack happened at a friend's home where the pair were staying.

Prosecutor Kevin Wardlaw said: 'They were both sitting on the settee in the living area and the defendant had a fork in his hand and began to stab her neck, ear and jaw.

'She had butter smeared around her face. She needed to use the toilet but he told her she would have to urinate herself.

'He threw a bottle of orange at her and refused to allow her to change. He was hitting her legs and arms with his fists.

'He said when she did finally leave the house he would give her a 'Chelsea smile', which she knew was a cut from the lips to ear.'

The court heard  Miss Dixon managed to dial 999 from her mobile. Operators were able to hear Weatherston say 'get off the floor' and 'you are going nowhere'.

But when Weatherston realised his victim was trying to get help, the call was disconnected and police were unable to trace her location.

Weatherston went on to cut Miss Dixon on her thigh with a Stanley knife.

Mr Wardlaw added: 'He said by the time she left she would give her daughter nightmares, would need a closed casket and he said he would stab her.'

Geoff Knowles, defending, said Weatherston has a history of drink and drug misuse and had been taken wrongly-prescribed medication for many years. 

The judge also gave Wetherston a two-and-a-half-year extended licence period on top of his prison sentence.
