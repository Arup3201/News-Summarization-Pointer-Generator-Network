Somersaulting over a Formula One car on a BMX, bunny hopping over train tracks and using a giant Dandy comic as an over-sized cycle ramp, a stunning new stunt video could easily have been conceived in the mind of an over imaginative child.

But Scottish stunt cyclist Danny MacAskill dreamt up the skilfull display in a giant play room himself for a Red Bull sponsored video released yesterday.

The 27-year-old daredevil's latest clip begins with a younger version of the biker playing in his room in a remote cottage on the isle of Skye - where Danny himself was brought up.

See the video below

Over-sized: Danny MacAskill sits on top of a giant copy of the Dandy comic which was used to film the Imaginate clip

Child's play: Glasgow's old transport museum was turned into an over-sized play room for the video which took two years to make

Toy room: The video features Danny MacAskill jumping over giant Rubix cubes and building blocks

But when the camera zooms in, the toy figure on the miniature bike comes to life in the form of renowned stunt cyclist Danny, and what follows is a staggering array of tricks.

The former bike mechanic jumps over and somersaults off a series of oversized props made to look like toy building blocks, Rubix cubes and even flipping over the top of a Red Bull Formula One racing car.

But one of the props was not just made to look life-size - Danny is seen riding along the top of and performing a series of tricks on the end of the gun of a real Army tank.

Although the inspiration for the Imaginate video came from Danny's own childhood dreams, making the short clip itself was anything but child's play - it took two years to put together.

Danny had already produced four episodes for the Imaginate series, but the fifth - filmed at Glasgow's former Museum of Transport Kelvin Hall - has been eagerly awaited.

Long held dream: The idea for Imaginate was conceived from MacAskill's own boyhood dreams of becoming a stunt cyclist

Giant leap: Part of the video clip features the stunt man performing an outrageous flip over the top of a Red Bull Formula One car

Daredevil: Danny performs a stunning flip over one of the set's giant obstacles

Of the new project Danny said: 'I have had such a free-range to build the set ups that have allowed me to do the tricks that have just been in my dreams until now.'

But it very nearly didn't happen according to the Scottish Sun.

Danny was struck down with labyrinthitis back in March, a serious condition that can leave sufferers with poor balance for years and can cause deafness.

Unrecognisable: Filming for the impressive clip took place at Glasgow's old Museum of Transport, Kelvin Hall, which was transformed into a giant play room

Painstaking: The video took two years to film and was almost scrapped in March when Danny fell ill

Dangerous: Danny MacAskill backflips out of a giant air vent onto an over-sized Dandy during the Imaginate filming in Glasgow

Fortunately, Danny made a full recovery within weeks and production of the video could continue.

The stuntman rose to fame following the release of his ‘Inspired Bicycles’ riding film, has now had more than 65 million internet views of his three most recent clips.

He was nominated for the 2012 National Geographic Adventurer of the Year award and performed the stunts for 2012 film Premium Rush starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
