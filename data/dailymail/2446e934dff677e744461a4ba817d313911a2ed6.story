A clothing store in Beijing has provoked outrage after posting a sign in the window banning Chinese customers.

The sign, which was reportedly put up a week ago, translated to: 'Chinese not admitted, except for staff.'

A shop assistant explained it was for business reasons - but another said it was because Chinese customers are irritating.

The sign posted in the window of a Beijing clothing store said: 'Chinese not admitted, except for staff'

One employee at the shop on Yabaolu Street, a popular shopping destination, said Chinese customers are 'too annoying' and 'Chinese women often try on lots of clothes but end up buying nothing'.  

A reporter from the Beijing Youth Daily entered the store posing as a customer but was refused by staff, who said they did not sell clothes to Chinese nationals. 

An employee told the paper that it had been put up to avoid competitors from copying their designs. 

Shanghaiist.com reported an employee also said the sign had been put after a Chinese customer stole a tourist's wallet then the owners of the shop were forced to pay $5000 in compensation.

'We didn't mean to debase our nationals, but sometimes they have gone too far', one employee said.

On social network Weibo, China's answer to Twitter, people were outraged and called for the store to be closed down.

One user said: 'Is this still China?' 

But Li Xiandong, a professor from China University of Political Science and Law, said that although the sign is discriminatory, the owner hasn't broken any laws as racial discrimination is not illegal in China.

'This may not be regarded as illegal, but this is extremely improper judging from cultural aspects,' he said.
