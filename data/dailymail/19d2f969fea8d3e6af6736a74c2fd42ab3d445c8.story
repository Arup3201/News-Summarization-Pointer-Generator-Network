A 50-year-old Missouri woman was jailed after she threatened some neighborhood children with a chainsaw while wearing a ski mask.

Lynn Marie Herzog of Winfield, has been charged with felony harassment of a child under 17 following Sunday's incident.

Neighbor, Patty Fleming,  called the police after witnessing Herzog screaming and cursing at her son and his friend while wearing a ski mask and shaking a chainsaw.

She told Fox2 that Herzog had been sawing a tree when she confronted the children.

'I come out of my door and hear her screaming at the kids. The boys start walking and she starts walking towards them with her skull mask and her chain saw, shaking it like she was going to hurt the kids,' Fleming said.

In the past neighbors say Herzog has screamed abuse at the neighborhood kids and has also been seen 
photographing and videotaping them.

Herzog, who in the past has accused neighbor boys of throwing rocks at her or her home, faces up to four years in prison if convicted.

Neighbors believe a mental treatment facility would be better than prison.

Herzog, who lives with her elderly father, was jailed on $10,000 bond. She doesn't have an attorney.

Sheriff's department spokesman Andy 
Binder said the chain saw was not running during the alleged incident. 
Manker told police she didn't believe the children were in danger.
