Phil Neville's future with Manchester United remains unresolved but it appears increasingly likely that he will have to accept a markedly reduced role at Old Trafford next season.

Sportsmail understands that Neville will hold high level talks with executive vice-chairman Edward Woodward within the next week as the two parties attempt to find a compromise solution following the appointment of Louis van Gaal.

Neville, a graduate of the Class of '92, was brought to Old Trafford by the recently-deposed David Moyes last summer in the role of first-team coach and was then retained when Ryan Giggs assumed managerial responsibilities for the final four games of the season.

Right-Hand Man: David Moyes' former assistant Phil Neville is likely to have a reduced role this season

Experience: He has more recently been at the World Cup as part of the BBC's coverage

However, new manager Louis van Gaal has brought in his own men to work alongside himself and Giggs, who will work as assistant manager.

Marcel Bout was appointed as an assistant coach at the beginning of the summer and further doubt was cast over Neville's role after fellow Dutchman Albert Stuivenberg was appointed on Sunday afternoon to work under Van Gaal with the first team.

The United players who did not feature at the World Cup - including cast-offs such as Bebe and Anderson - returned for medical tests late last week before beginning ball-playing sessions under Ryan Giggs on Monday.

The new man: Ryan Giggs will be the new No 2 at Manchester United

Experience: But the Man Utd board want to keep as many of the Class of '92 as possible at Old Trafford

Certainly, one would expect that a senior coach to be present on the first day back for pre-season but a senior United source was unable to confirm on Monday evening whether Neville had been present at the club's Carrington training ground as the players regrouped following their summer break.

United are understood to be keen to retain Neville's services in some capacity, maintaining that 'the Class of '92 are very important to the club' but with Van Gaal's backroom staff becoming increasingly bloated, the former United player is going to have to settle for a role carrying considerably less responsibility than last season.
