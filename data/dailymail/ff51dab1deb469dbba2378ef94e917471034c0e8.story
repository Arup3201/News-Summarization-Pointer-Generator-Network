Two students attending the same middle school in Connecticut have landed in trouble after posting images of guns on their Instagram accounts on the same day.

One of the students, a 13-year-old boy, was charged with disorderly conduct for sharing an image of two firearms Thursday morning accompanied by a note that read: 'I think I'm ready to go to school :-).'

In a separate incident, investigators said a boy put up a picture of a pistol on his social media account and wrote, 'Colt Anaconda .357. Damn I love revolvers.'

Both teens attend John Read Middle School in Redding, Connecticut, which was named this week a school of distinction for the highest overall performance, according to The Redding Pilot.

In the first case, Redding Police Chief Douglas Fuchs said a student spotted the Instagram post depicting the two guns at around 8.30am and contacted school officials.

The unnamed 13-year-old gun enthusiast was then removed from class by a resource officer. The photo of a Colt was posted by his schoolmate at around 5.30pm Thursday, but was later taken down. 

In both cases, investigators determined that the middle schoolers did not have any firearms in their possession on school property. The 13-year-old boys insisted that they never intended to hurt anyone. 

Police officers have seized the two weapons featured in the 13-year-old's Instagram pictures, which turned out to be pellet guns, The Courant reported.

Chief Fuchs said one of the facsimile pistols had its tell-tale plastic tip removed, making it appear more realistic.

The 13-year-old has been charged with misdemeanor disorderly conduct and released to his parents.

According to detectives, the John Read student who posted a photo of the Anaconda revolver pulled the image from the Internet. No charges are expected to be filed in that case.

Schools Superintendent Dr. Bernard Josefsberg and John Read Principal Diane Martin sent a joint letter to parents Friday addressing the incidents, according to The Redding Pilot.

'Whatever was going through the minds of these two boys when they pressed "Send," they now know that those photos in this place at this time are not joking matters,' the missive read in part. 'As they should have known, Redding school officials and Redding police understood their behavior as possibly threatening, potentially sinister and most certainly disruptive.'

The alarming incidents come a week before the one-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook school massacre that has left 26 people dead in Newtown, Connecticut - a town located about 11 miles from Redding.
