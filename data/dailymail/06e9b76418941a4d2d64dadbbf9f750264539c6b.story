Saad Al-Hilli, from Surrey, was murdered in a suspected assassination while on holiday with his family in France

The British engineer murdered at an isolated Alpine beauty spot was on the verge of selling a ruined property 400 miles away across France, it emerged yesterday.

Saad Al-Hilli, 50, was shot dead along with his wife, Ikbal, 47, and his mother-in-law Suhaila Al-Allaf, 74, on September 5th.

All had been on a holiday with the Al-Hilli’s two children Zainab, seven, and Zeena, four, staying in their caravan by Lake Annecy, in eastern France.

The Al-Hilli family were all murdered as they sat in their BMW estate, on the outskirts of the nearby village of Chevaline, while French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, 45, died next to the car.

Until now, French detectives assumed that Mr Al-Hilli’s 1 million pounds plus family home in Clayton, Surrey, was their sole residence.

But Sud-Ouest (South West), the regional newspaper, tonight revealed that they also had an ancient house at Saint-Macaire, in the Gironde department, some 30 miles from Bordeaux.

It is a significant find because it proves that Mr Al-Hilli had investment interests in the country where his horrific murder took place.

The fact that he was involved in a property business deal will also be of great interest to investigators.

Mr Al-Hilli had bought the property in the medieval village, which has a population of just over 2000 people, in the 1990s for an unknown sum, and had been seen working on it over the years.

Despite this, it is today little more than an overgrown ruin, in Admiral Courbet Road, in the lower part of the hilled village.

Locals told Sud Ouest that Mr Al-Hilli had been ‘planning to create a small apartment in order to rent it.’

The paper adds: ‘On a number of occasions he turned up to rebuild the floor and roof, before leaving the area without returning.’

Sud Ouest says the house has never been occupied, and is practically in the same state as when he left.

‘It seems that the owner had put it up for sale, but the deal had not been concluded,’ the paper adds, displaying a picture of the house on its website. 

The development came as detectives admitted they were no closer finding the killers responsible for the outrages, nor indeed the motive.

No theory has been ruled out, including the possibility that Mr Al-Hilli’s past life in Iraq, where he was born, may have involved him with sinister forces.

Family disputes and business conflicts are also being looked at, while detectives have not ruled out the possibility that cyclist Mr Mollier may have been the intended target of a professional ‘hit’.

Claims that only one gun was used to kill everybody is likely to be disproved by full ballistics test results which are out in October.

While the 25 spent bullet cartridges 
found at the scene are all of the same kind, they could in fact have 
come from a number of weapons of the same make.

This throws up the possibility of a well-equipped, highly-trained gang circling the car and then opening fire.

Both
children were left alive by the killers, who had clinically pumped 
bullets into everybody else, including five into Mr Mollier.

Zainab
was found staggering around outside the car by Brett Martin, a British 
former RAF serviceman who cycled by moments after the attack, but he saw
nobody except the schoolgirl.

Her four-year-old sister, Zeena, was found unscathed and hiding in the car eight hours later.

Both sisters are now back in Britain, and are believed to have been reunited at a secret location near London.
