Fit as a fiddle: Keep fit fanatic Anthony Connor, 39, said a debilitating stroke left him with a limp and he could only walk 75 metres in five minutes

A disability benefits cheat nicknamed 'Fit as a Fiddler' after he was caught completing a 34 mile triathlon escaped jail today.

Keep fit fanatic Anthony Connor, 39, said a debilitating stroke left him with a limp and he could only walk 75 metres in five minutes.

He pocketed over £17,000 in state handouts after saying he needed help getting in and out of the bath and getting up and down the stairs.

But Connor’s run of luck ran out after
investigators secretly filmed him swimming, cycling and running for a 
total of 55km during the Tatton Park triathlon in Knutsford, Cheshire.

The
footage showed Connor swimming for 5 kilometres whizzing past spectators on his bicycle during a 40k race and later raising his arms 
in victory as he completed a 10k run. He completed the entire course in 
just two and a half hours.

Today
Connor, from Baguley, Greater Manchester had been facing jail after he 
admitted a charge of failing to notify the DWP of change of 
circumstances.

But he was 
given 12 weeks prison, suspended for a year, and ordered him to carry 
out 100 hours of community service by magistrates in Manchester after 
they were told how he had lost the respect of his friends and family.

The
court heard Connor had initially claimed benefit legitimately in 2006 
after suffering a stroke that year. As well as disability handouts he 
also claimed income support, housing benefits and council tax benefit.

Prosecutor
Mr Paul Darnborough said: 'On a medical form provided to the DWP, it 
put him at a higher rate for mobility and lower rate for care due to a 
stroke suffered that left him with a weakness to the left side, 
virtually unable to walk and only able to walk 75 metres in five 
minutes.

'He was left with a
limp and needed someone with him when he went outdoors. It permanently 
affected him 24/7. The lower rate was because he needed help getting in 
and out of the bath, tying his shoelaces and preparing his food.

'It is accepted that his disability were not commensurate with the claim he made.

'Surveillance was made between August 2010 and February 2011 at considerable costs. During these observations Anthony Connor is seen completing a triathlon event in September 2010 at Tatton Park, a feat of physical endurance, 5km swim, 40km bike ride and 10km run, that’s the athletic endurance.

'He completed the event in a very respectable time, two hours 30 minutes. He was seen the previous day covering his bike.

'He was employed during labouring duties, his employer was aware that had had a stroke and missed only 10 jobs out of 81. The fraudulent abuse of the benfits system prejudices the very needs of the proper applicant who are wholly dependent on this type of benefit for these vulnerable and needy people.'

The court heard the over payments from June 2010 to July 2011 were £5850.29 in income support, £3997.64 in disability living allowance, £6187.34 in housing benefit and £1.057.80 in council tax benefit.

Benefits: As well as disability handouts Connor also claimed income support, housing and council tax benefit

In mitigation defence lawyer Chris Joseph said: 'It is the case that although he suffered a major attack in 2006, the affects are still on going and he has difficulty moving, and if speaking for any length of time his speech becomes slurred. At work he is often accused of having a drink over lunch time because of his speech.

'All that seems hollow when he completed a triathlon in a good time. Prior to 2006, he was an athlete who regularly took part in events of this nature. The assessment was that he couldn’t walk any further than 75 metres.'

He said Connor got back into training because he 'wanted to become fit and healthy again', adding: 'It was a challenge to himself to see if he could do it again.

But a month later he suffered a mini stroke.

'Had he not taken this decision, he is of the belief that he would not be as well as he is today and would still be in receipt of a genuine benefit claim,' said Mr Joseph.

He went on: 'He accepts that he claimed benefit when he shouldn’t have. He has said that at the time when he continued to claim benefit his future was uncertain and had suffered two mini attacks.

'He planned to set up a business but didn’t know if it would be successful, there was a very convenient safety net underneath him. You can see how easy it was for him to fall into the trap when deep down he knew he shouldn’t have.

'He has now set up a floor polishing business with a partner. It has never been something that he kept secret. He is now working and no longer in receipt of benefits and he wants to pay back the over payments he accepts he had become over reliant on.

'He has lost work as a result of the publicity and lost all the respect of friends and family.'
