A six-month-old Darwin baby born with a major heart defect has been denied life saving surgery at a Melbourne hospital, and now her mother wants to know why.

Sandra Pastrikos is facing an uphill battle in the fight to keep her daughter, Doreen Pastrikos alive after she was prevented from having the life-saving operation at Melbourne's Royal Children's Hospital because of a severe change in her condition back in February.

Her daughter was initially scheduled to be flown to Melbourne three months ago, but was prevented from traveling because she suffered a 'tet spell' which is brought about by a dramatic drop in the amount of oxygen in the blood.

Denied proper care: Sandra Pastrikos said her daughter was prevented from having heart surgery at Melbourne Royal Children's Hospital due to an improper duty of care in Darwin

Now her mother has squared the blame on Royal Darwin Hospital clinicians for failing to provide a proper duty of care, which lead to her daughter 'going blue in the face.'

She wants to know the exact circumstances which lead her to have the 'tet spell', and has demanded an inquiry be undertaken at RDH to investigate exactly why she was moved from the RDH children's ward to the intensive care unit.

She claims she wasn't told about her daughter's change in condition straight away, and the fact she had been relocated to the ICU while waiting for her daughter to arrive in Melbourne.

Doreen suffered a severe 'tet spell' and was moved into ICU without her mother having any knowledge of her condition

She told the NT news: 'I don’t believe she was being watched and we want an internal investigation into the circumstances.'

'I have always been able to control her tet spells very quickly. I want to know if my baby was being monitored properly while I was away from her that led her to have an episode so severe that it has now destroyed her last chance at life.'

But in an email statement, seen by the NT news, the director of medical services at RDH Dr Sara Watson said: “We can confirm that the patient (Doreen) is being treated appropriately under the care of local senior specialists in conjunction with interstate specialists.”

Ms Watson also told MailOnline: "This is a sad and complex case and our thoughts are with the parents and family. There have been multiple independent interstate clinical opinions received, regarding the safety of performing cardiac surgery for the patient.”

It has been a tiring an emotional three months for Mrs Pastrikos who has been spending 24-hours-a-day by her daughter's hospital cot.

Not only does she have her daughter's illness to contend with, but she is also a mother to seven other children two of which are under the age of seven.

In what looked like a positive sign of hope for the family, doctors from Brisbane's Mater Hospital had come forward with an offer to perform the surgery just three weeks ago, but that has since lapsed because of a high chance it could leave the six-month-old with brain damage.

Mrs Pastrikos said she has been left to feel like her daughter's life is worthless, and still doesn't know if her daughter will be given the life-saving surgery she needs.

'(We are) being made to feel that more or less she does not have the right to live.'

'She is in dire and desperate need of the surgery and if she doesn't we know she will die,' she said.

The family is now appealing for an independent pediatric specialist to examine Doreen following the family's allegations surrounding her treatment.
