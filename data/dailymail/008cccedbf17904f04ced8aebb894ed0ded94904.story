Hot lava from an erupting volcano killed six people who were sleeping in a beach village on a small Indonesian island.

Mount Rokatenda in East Nusa Tenggara province erupted early yesterday morning  with hot ash and smoke from the volcano spewing about a mile into the air.

Nearly 3,000 people have been evacuated from the area on Palue island, according to the National Disaster Mitigation Agency.

Those who died included three adults and two children. The age of the sixth person who was killed is still unclear.

The bodies of the adults killed have been recovered from Ponge beach in Rokirole village, however,   the children's remains had not been found.

Video footage on Indonesia's TVOne showed giant plumes of white and gray smoke and ash belching from the volcano into a sunny blue sky.

Prior to Saturday's eruption, many residents had already been moved to safer areas. The volcano has been rumbling since last October.

The disaster agency said the volcano spewed ash and smoke about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) into the air.

The eruption lasted about seven 
minutes, said Frans Wangge, who heads the volcano's monitoring post.

He 
said the hot lava burned trees around the beach and villages, and made 
it difficult to reach the area where the victims were killed.

Domi
Dange, a Catholic priest helping those who fled to the district town of
Maumere on nearby Flores island, said some residents, who had refused 
to leave when the area was earlier cleared, were sleeping under tents 
near the beach.

However, details about the six people who were killed and where they were located at the time of the eruption remained unclear.

Local authorities, including police and 
army officials along with members of a search and rescue agency, were 
heading to tiny Palue island to help with evacuations.

'We will see the best steps to be taken, but clearly they have to be evacuated,' said Yoseph Ansar Rara, chief of Sikka District, which oversees the island. He said those already evacuated had agreed to be relocated to Flores island.

Mount Rokatenda is one of about 129 active volcanoes in Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 17,000 islands that's home to some 240 million people.

The country is prone to earthquakes and volcanic activity because it sits along the Pacific 'Ring of Fire,' a horseshoe-shaped series of fault lines.
