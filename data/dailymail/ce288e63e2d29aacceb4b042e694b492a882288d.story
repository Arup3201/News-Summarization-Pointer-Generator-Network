Theresa May has shelved a decision on whether water cannon can be used on the streets of Britain until after the election, in a major snub to Boris Johnson.

Mrs May has refused to sign off the controversial riot control machines despite pressure from the London mayor, who last year spent £220,000 buying three cannon for use in public order emergencies.

Home Office sources confirmed last night no ruling on permission would be made this side of the election. That means the machines will lay idle, in a potential embarrassment for the mayor.

Soon after buying the three German machines last year, Mr Johnson said it was ‘highly likely’ the Home Secretary would sign them off, adding: ‘My view is we need to get on and equip the police with the water cannon they need, or might need.’

But in the past she has expressed concerns about whether they fit with the British model of policing and is thought to have concerns about their safety.

The standoff over the issue cast light on the ongoing rivalry between the two, both of whom are seen as potential Tory leadership candidates should David Cameron lose the election and step down.

Mrs May's Home Office has been locked in a row with the London Mayor over the decision to buy the machines and whether they fit with UK policing

Last night City Hall sources insisted Mr Johnson had known about the timetable for some time and was ‘very relaxed’ about the delay.

A spokesman for the Mayor’s Office for Policing and Crime defended the decision to purchase the cannon, pointing towards support for them among Londoners.

He said: ‘Independent polling shows that the majority of Londoners support the police having water cannon at their disposal for use in exceptional circumstances. 

'The Mayor has made his position clear and awaits the Home Secretary’s licensing decision.’

But critics of cannon warn that in incidents on the continent they have led to serious injury and even death.

In one case in Germany a man was blinded and in another a protester was stunned and then killed after being run over.

Water cannon have been used in Northern Ireland to quell public order incidents, but never on the UK mainland.

Calls for their introduction came during the 2011 riots and later student protests in the capital.

Last summer The Prime Minister’s spokesman also endorsed their use, saying the prime minister ‘supports’ the police’s application for water cannon.

Mrs May and Mr Johnson two regularly appear at or near the top of polls on who Tories would like as a future leader. She is known to regard the Mayor as a 'faintly ridiculous' figure.

At the time the mayor purchased the machines, he was warned it could be a waste of taxpayers’ money.

When Mr Johnson purchased the machines he said it was 'highly likely' the Home Secretary would sign off on their use, a political gamble that seems to have backfired

Mr Johnson has previously urged police to get 'medieval' on rioters, and said officers must never again be left powerless in the face of overwhelming violence like that seen during the riots.

But he stressed the chances of the machines being used in the capital, or other mainland cities, remained 'vanishingly rare'.

Police argue water cannon would be useful in a static confrontation where there is a need to create space between police lines and violent crowds.

They said it could have helped protect firefighters and paramedics after shops were set ablaze as rioting spread to Croydon in 2011.
