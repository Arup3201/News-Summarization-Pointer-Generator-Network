Denmark's Prime Minister today joined mourners at the funeral of Copenhagen shooting victim Dan Uzan as hundreds gathered to pay their respects to the slain security guard.

Both prime minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt and the country's justice minister Mette Frederiksen attended the funeral, held at a Jewish cemetery in Copenhagen.

Mourners entered and exited the ceremony under the watch of a heavy police presence, with snipers and sniffer dogs deployed throughout the area.

Mr Uzan was killed by gunman Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein, 22, while guarding a synagogue nine hours after El-Hussein had shot dead a Danish filmmaker across town.

Soon afterwards, he was killed in a firefight with police which concluded a shooting spree that authorities say may have been inspired by the terror attacks in Paris last month.

In the first attack, El-Hussein killed a Danish filmmaker outside the building hosting the free speech seminar Saturday with a single shot from a M95 assault rifle, police spokesman Joergen Skov said.

El-Hussein then sprayed the entrance with 27 bullets, wounding three police officers inside.

That type of weapon was used by the Danish military between 1995 and 2010, said Rene Gyldensten, a spokesman for the Danish Defence Acquisition and Logistics Organization. It is also used by other NATO forces.

'It could be one of our weapons,' Gyldensten said, adding that police had not yet asked the Defense Ministry to check serial number records.

It was unclear how El-Hussein obtained the weapon, which cannot be purchased legally in Denmark.

Investigators said police returned fire, including Swedish officers who were in Copenhagen as bodyguards for Lars Vilks, a Swedish artist who has received numerous death threats for caricaturing the Prophet Muhammad and who may have been the main target of the attack.

It was unclear whether they missed or whether the gunman was wearing a bullet-proof vest that stopped their bullets.

After fleeing the scene, El-Hussein appeared nine hours later outside a synagogue in Copenhagen where he fired nine rounds with two hand guns, killing a Jewish security guard and wounding two police officers. Skov says El-Hussein carried the two handguns when he was shot by a SWAT team early Sunday.

A Denmark native with Palestinian parents, El-Hussein had been in and out of prison for violence and weapons offenses and had recently served time for a stabbing on a commuter train, court documents show.

The Danish Security and Intelligence Service, known by its Danish acronym PET, acknowledged Tuesday that El-Hussein was flagged in September under a program meant to alert PET to 'inmates who are at risk of radicalization.'

What prompted prison authorities to sound the alarm is unclear, but PET said that the information gave the agency 'no reason to believe' that he was plotting attacks.

El-Hussein's family have asked for him to be buried in a Muslim cemetery in a Copenhagen suburb but police have not yet released his body, said Kasem Said Ahmad of the Danish Islamic Funeral Foundation.
