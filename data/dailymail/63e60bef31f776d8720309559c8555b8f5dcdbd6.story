A woman who provided false alibis for two honeymoon killers in Antigua has been jailed for six years.

Georgette Aaron tried to thwart police investigations into the brutal murders of Welsh couple Ben and Catherine Mullany on the holiday island in 2008.

Local men Kaniel Martin and Avie Howell were later convicted for killing newlyweds Mr and Mrs Mullany as well as local shopkeeper Woneta Anderson.

Mother-of-two Aaron told officers she had been with her teenage lover Howell and accomplice Martin at the time when the Mullanys were shot.

Antiguan prosecutor Adlai Smith said her statements to police were a deliberate attempt to derail a major police investigation.

Judge Justice Albert Redhead said he had no choice but to jail Aaron, who continued to lie through her trial.

At a hearing in Antigua's High Court last Friday, he said: 'You persisted in making a false alibi, knowing that the murders had been committed.'

Mr Mullany and his wife Catherine, both 31, were both shot in the head while on honeymoon.

They had been married a mere fortnight when Martin and Howell burst into their hotel chalet at 5am on July 27 while brandishing a Glock pistol.

After gunning down the Welsh newlyweds in cold blood, Martin and Howell then went on to kill a local shopkeeper Ms Anderson in almost identical circumstances less than a fortnight later.

Morriston Hospital doctor Mrs Mullany died instantly, while her widower was flown back to Wales on a life support machine via a specialist air ambulance.

But despite the best efforts of his wife's medical colleagues, he died a week after the shooting.

Martin and Howell were arrested and charged in August 2008, but did not stand trial until June 2011.

Despite them both making not guilty pleas, both men refused to give evidence in court.

The pair were later given full life sentences.

Earlier this year, Howell - also known by the street name 'demon' - was shot and killed by police after escaping from prison.

He and Martin were also charged with two other murders in 2008.

Happy together: The couple's family were said to be 'extremely shocked' at the news that one of the killers had been able to escape

Sources say 'they are doubtful' whether Martin will ever stand trial for those killings.

However, at Aaron's hearing last week prosecutor Mr Smith said he was convinced Howell and Martin would have gone to kill more had they not been caught when they were.

Following the hearing, prosecutor Mr Smith said: 'We echo the sentiments of the learned trial judge, Justice Albert Redhead, that the court should take a dim view of persons trying to assist others to evade justice.'

Mr and Mrs Mullany's name lives on via the charity The Mullany Fund, which aims to help people from less well off backgrounds get into medicine.
