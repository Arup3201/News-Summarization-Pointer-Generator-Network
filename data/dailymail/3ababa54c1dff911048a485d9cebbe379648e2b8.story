Housing Minister Cecile Duflot was wolf-whistled by men in parliament

France's government ministers are being sent on anti-sexism courses after a spate of politically incorrect gaffes by MPs belittling women.

Male members of President Francois Hollande's socialist cabinet will be taught how to avoid 'stereotyping and inappropriate language' when talking about women.

The idea is the brainchild of new Women's Rights minister and staunch feminist Najat Vallaud-Belkacem.

It comes after a recent blunder by agriculture Minister Stephane Le Foll, who told L'Express magazine: 'Out of 15 people in my cabinet, seven are women.

'I've tried to promote women as much as possible, even though the subjects are very technical.'

Two months earlier, housing Minister Cecile Duflot was wolf-whistled by men in parliament after she walked into the chamber wearing a knee-length dress.

Former sports minister Chantal Jouanno also said she avoided wearing skirts altogether for fear of attracting smutty comments.

The debate over sexism amongst powerful public figures erupted last year after shamed former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn was accused of sexually assaulting a New York hotel maid.

One left-wing politician caused outrage by describing the scandal as the 'debagging of a female servant'.

So far 12 ministers have attended an hour-long course by feminist academics on how not to be sexist, and another 26 more are signed up to attend.

A government source said: 'The ministers 
have loved it. They're coming up with ideas on where and how they can 
put what they have learned into practice.

'For those already aware of the issues, it's good to hear them again. For those who aren't, it's especially useful.'

Socialist President Francois Hollande has sought to break with sexist traditions of the past by appointing the same number of female as male ministers for the first time in French history.

France now ranks ahead of Britain and the United States in terms of female representation in parliament, with the share of women rising to 27 percent in last year's legislative election, from 19 percent five years earlier.
