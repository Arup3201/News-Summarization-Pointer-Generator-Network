Javier Hernandez's strike for Mexico helped seal his country's place in the last 16 of the World Cup - as well as giving the forward a welcome boost of confidence.

The 25-year-old endured a frustrating season at Manchester United under David Moyes and his form suffered as a result.

But Hernandez's goal after coming on as a substitute contributed to Mexico's 3-1 win over Croatia, a victory which set-up a second round tie with Louis van Gaal's Holland.

Van Gaal will take over at Old Trafford after the World Cup and he will be able to get a first-hand look at his Mexican forward on Sunday in Fortaleza.

'This is a goal that gives me a lot of confidence,' Hernandez told Mexican newpspaper Record.

'But I'm never going to feel pressured by anything.

'I don't live off goals. I live off enjoying myself, off the confidence I have in myself and something that many people, throughout this year, have not had in me.

'I feel I'm on the right path and I want to continue like this.'

The forward is keen to contribute more for Mexico at the World Cup - whether that be as a substitute or as a start.

'I had three very good years with the national team and then one year in which I did not play for my club and I ended up on the bench,' he said.

'One must focus on the present and take it one game at a time.

'We are going to enjoy this win, it was a huge step forward.

'We are not going to wake up lifting the World Cup nor are we going to feel like we did in the qualifying round, feeling we might be ridiculed in this competition.

'We are very humble and respectful. We will think of Holland next.'

As well as facing soon-to-be United coach Van Gaal, Hernandez will also go toe-to-toe with his team-mate at Old Trafford, Dutch captain Robin van Persie.

Grounded: Despite their win, Hernandez says Mexico will not get carried away

Van Persie has bagged three World Cup goals already but he sat out Holland's 2-0 victory over Chile after picking up a yellow card in each of his first two matches.

Hernandez said: 'It will be a joy.

'He is a team-mate with whom I've experienced two important years.

'I've learned a lot from him, we won a title and it will be very nice to see him again.'
