'Liar': Emmanuel Labram repeatedly told the patient that her tumour had been removed even though it was still there, the tribunal heard

A surgeon ‘lied and lied and lied’ to a woman with a brain tumour by claiming he had removed it, a tribunal heard yesterday.

Emmanuel Labram told the woman he had successfully removed the entire growth when he had removed only a tiny sample for a biopsy.

After lying to her he convinced her not to seek further treatment for two years after the operation by insisting she was absolutely fine.

By the time the woman decided to seek private treatment for her problem, the lesion on her brain was inoperable.

Yesterday a Medical Practitioners Tribunal hearing was told Mr Labram had repeatedly lied to the patient, identified as Patient A, after carrying out the operation at the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in September 2008.

Craig Sephton, QC, for the General Medical Council, told the hearing: ‘It is difficult to understand why Mr Labram initially told the patient and her husband that he had completely removed the lesion when he must have known that no such thing had happened.

'He then lied and lied and lied in order to cover up his initial failure.’

The misconduct hearing was told that after lying to Patient A he forged and falsified documents and also lied to medical colleagues.

Labram, 58, who qualified in Ghana in 1981, even sent letters to the patient’s GP telling him that no further treatment was necessary, it was said.

The hearing in Manchester was told that Patient A had fallen ill on holiday in November 2007, experiencing double vision, and booked an appointment with her optician.

She was then referred to the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary where an MRI scan revealed she had a tumour about one inch in diameter in her brain.

The woman, who saw Labram to discuss her options for treatment in June 2008, told the hearing: ‘My first questions were, “Is it accessible? Is it operable?” and, “Is there anything you can do about it?”

Surgeon: Emmanuel Labram treated the woman at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary - then repeatedly lied that her tumour had been removed

‘He said, “Oh yes. That’s the only way to find out”, so I was confident the surgery would go well and I would find out what was causing the double vision.’

She added: ‘I was under the impression that he was going to remove the tumour.’

After the neurosurgeon operated in September 2008 he told her that he had removed 100 per cent of the tumour, she said.

‘He said, “It’s all gone”. He said it was just calcium deposits. That’s how he described it,’ she told the hearing.

Mr Sephton said: ‘Mr Labram gave 
Patient A’s husband a vivid description of how he had removed the 
tumour. In fact he had not excised the lesion at all.’

The hearing was told that Labram had 
removed only four tiny hard pale fragments when he knew the tumour was 
an inch in diameter. In his medical notes he simply recorded that 
‘biopsies’ of the tumour had been taken.

'He
then lied and lied and lied in order to cover up his initial failure 
and the GMC will therefore invite you to conclude that is what has 
happened'

Craig Sephton QC, for the General Medical Council

Mr Sephton said there was no explanation as to why Labram had told the patient he had removed the entire tumour.

‘The only explanation is he was being dishonest,’ he said.

‘There is no clinical justification not to tell the truth to Patient A or her GP. Mr Labram acted dishonestly in asserting what he knew was not true.’

In January 2009 the surgeon is said to have altered a pathology report and sent a forged copy to his patient in order to conceal the fact she might need further treatment.

Two months later he failed to tell Patient A that another MRI scan she had had showed the tumour was in fact unchanged.

The GMC claims he did not tell her this because he wanted to conceal the fact he had not removed the lesion in the first place.

Labram then changed his stance after a third MRI scan, telling Patient A and her GP that the lesion had returned, when he knew there had been no change.

He again changed his tune in May 2010, now telling Patient A that he had not known the tumour was present when he operated on her and giving her another doctored pathology report, the panel heard.

Patient A raised concerns about her treatment and the medical director at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary ordered an investigation.

When asked about his actions in 2011, the surgeon allegedly continued to lie to bosses, claiming ‘he did not want to cause further stress to the patient’.

‘He was given the opportunity to come clean about the lies he had told and elected to not do so,’ said Mr Sephton.

Labram, of Aberdeen, faces 11 allegations relating to his conduct.

After a failed application to be voluntarily erased from the medical register, he withdrew from  proceedings and is not present or represented at the hearing.

He is currently able to work within the UK subject to conditions that keep him closely monitored by a professional regulator.

If found guilty of misconduct he could be struck off the medical register.

The hearing continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
