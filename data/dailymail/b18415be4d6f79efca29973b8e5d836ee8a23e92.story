When Lara Kelly started posting pictures on social media to track her weight loss journey, the 21-year-old never thought she would end up as the face of weight loss scams.

The corporate receptionist, from Bunbury in Western Australia, had lost 57 kilograms over three years through exercise and carefully planned eating plans.

To keep her motivated, Ms Kelly posted photos on her Tumblr and Instagram pages to help others.

Lara Kelly's pictures started appearing in weight loss advertisements, promoting diet supplements

The ads claims to help people to lose weight by erasing '13 kilos of belly fat in four weeks'

'It's a hard thing, it's a huge task [to lose weight],' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'I know for me to see other people who have done this and to achieve these results, it’s very motivating for me. I wanted to share my own experiences.

'For other people, it's good to have someone who's been though it before and ask questions.'

So far, her Tumblr blog has attracted about 20,000 followers. 

Another ad found by Lara Kelly, from Bunbury in Western Australia, which used her photo without permission

The 21-year-old has spent three years, exercising and devising eating plans, to lose a total of 57 kilograms

But her well-documented progress was twisted by online advertisements, who started using photographs of her dramatic transformation without her permission, to promote dieting pills which promised to 'erase 13 kilos of belly fat in four weeks'.

It was claimed Ms Kelly had used dieting pills to achieve her new look.

She had not been aware of the unauthorised use of her image until friends started tagging her and strangers made contact with her about the drugs she had allegedly used for her weight loss.

'People... asked me what my opinion was of them [the pills]. I had to tell them I'd never used them in my life,' Ms Kelly told Daily Mail Australia.

'When it first started getting messages I was shocked. I was trying to get my friends to report [the ads]. But when you get one taken down, 10 more pop up to take its place.'

Ms Kelly started out as 120 kilograms and was a size 18 to 20. She is now a size 8 and weighs 63 kilograms

The photographs used were taken from her Tumblr and Instagram sites, which she used to document her progress to motivate others and herself

Ms Kelly said she had tried to track the people who were taking her photo down but she was unsuccessful.

'It's mainly Facebook pages that post the links to other external sites,' she said.

'I message the pages and report them and they just disappear and then pop up again later, or they just block me.'

To help combat her picture being used for scams, Ms Kelly started watermarking her snaps with her Instagram handle.

But this did not stop them as it could be cropped out or blurred.

Ms Kelly urged people not the believe everything they read on the internet.

'Don't look at the picture and assume someone has taken drugs to lose 20 kilos in two weeks,' she said.

'Everyone wants a quick fix. Weight loss is hard, but it's worth it in the end.' 

Weight loss scams are described by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's Scam Watch as those that 'promise weight loss for little or no effort'.

'The scam may involve an unusual or restrictive diet, "revolutionary" exercise or fat-busting devices, or products such as pills, patches, or creams,' the website said.

'Often, attractive people or celebrities are used to sell the products. These may be people with a different body shape and metabolism to you and who use the product in conjunction with an exercise regime and strict diet.

'At best fad diets and products might result in a temporary weight loss in the short term and can be dangerous if followed over a longer period.'
