A strong earthquake struck north of Puerto Rico early this morning, causing minor damage.

Residents reported items falling in their home and dozens said they felt buildings sway in the capital of San Juan, about 61 miles from the quake's epicenter. No injuries have been reported.

The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake had a preliminary magnitude of 6.4 and struck at 12.01am about 35 miles north of Hatillo, and at a depth of 17.7 miles below the seabed.

The early-morning quake occurred 17 miles deep.

The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center 
initially said the quake could trigger a small local tsunami.

'There is the small possibility of a 
local tsunami that could affect coasts located usually no more than a 
hundred kilometers from the earthquake epicenter,' it said in its advisory.

But the 
U.S. National Weather Service Caribbean Tsunami Warning Program later
determined that there would be no tsunami.

Earthquakes of similar magnitude have struck near Puerto Rico in recent years, including a 5.4-magnitude one that shook the U.S. territory in March 2011 and another one of the same magnitude that struck on Christmas Eve in 2010.

Monday's earthquake comes just after the fourth anniversary of the 7.0 magnitude quake that shook Port-au-Prince in Haiti on January 12, 2010, killing tens of thousands and inflicting devastating destruction on the Caribbean Island.
