Australia beat Pakistan by five wickets to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the one-day international series.

Having won the toss and seen openers Ahmed Shehzad and Sarfraz Ahmed put on 126, Pakistan crumbled to 215 all out as Mitchell Johnson took three for 40.

Australia's top three failed to produce big scores but Glenn Maxwell carried them through with 76 and, having won the opening match by 93 runs thanks to Steve Smith's century, they appear well set to complete a series clean sweep in Abu Dhabi on Sunday.

Pakistan, though, had started well and Shehzad glanced Johnson's leg-side loosener for four as seven came from the first over.

James Faulkner's first ball brought a loud lbw appeal against Sarfraz but he survived and the batsmen's partnership passed 50 in the 12th over.

The last ball before drinks saw Sarfraz launch Xavier Doherty for six but Shehzad was first to his half-century, from 63 balls when he hit Lyon for his fifth four to also bring up Pakistan's century.

He was uncharacteristically dropped by George Bailey at mid-off before Sarfraz followed him to 50, from 60 balls with four fours and a six.

It all changed, though, when Shehzad pulled Doherty to mid-wicket to depart for 61 and Johnson returned to have Sarfraz caught at point for 65.

Captain Misbah-ul-Haq was run out for 15 and Umar Akmal made just five before becoming Johnson's second victim, again with the first ball of a spell.

Asad Shafiq hit Kane Richardson for six and Lyon for four but was then caught off the latter, chipping straight to Johnson for 29.

Shahid Afridi and Wahab Riaz contributed only two apiece and debutant Raza Hasan was run out without scoring - as was the lumbering Mohammad Irfan to finish the innings.

Hasan nearly had a wicket in each of his first two overs, but replays showed Aaron Finch's edge dropped short of Umar Akmal before a leaping Fawad was unable to cling on to Warner's sweep.

Finch made 14 before being given out on review after edging Irfan to keeper Sarfraz, who also caught Smith for 12 off Babar to leave Australia 39 for two.

Warner fell for 29 when a lusty blow was only prevented from going for six by the presence on the boundary of the 7ft Irfan, who took a good catch.

Maxwell had made only two when he edged Hasan to slip and was dropped by Akmal but he and Bailey put on 85 for the fourth wicket to all but make the game safe.

Maxwell crashed Afridi for six and his 56-ball half-century also featured six fours, and he added two more off Hasan in the next over.

Bailey was run out superbly for 28 by a direct hit from Shehzad but Maxwell reached 76 from 81 balls before being caught off a top edge.

Brad Haddin announced himself with a four and a six in succession off Hasan and with seven needed from six overs, James Faulkner finished the job with back-to-back boundaries.
