If you spot a commuter with Apple headphones on, you may want to avoid sitting near them if they have an iPhone 6. 

During tests, this handset was found to be the loudest among Apple's full range of iPhones including the 2G through to last year's iPhone 6 Plus. 

And, the eight-year-old 2G was able to reach a higher volume than the 2010 iPhone 4.

iClarified placed decibel meters by the speakers of each of Apple's iPhones, including 10 handsets from the original 2G to last year's iPhone 6 Plus (pictured left to right). The meter presents the maximum reading in A-weighted decibels, or dBA. This reading is used to show the loudness of a sound, as perceived by the ear

Having a louder phone can be beneficial, especially when playing music or conducting a phone call on loudspeaker.

But exposure to excessively loud noise - particularly when directed through headphones - can cause health problems, too.

In environments where noise exceeds 85 dBA, for example, employees are required to wear ear protectors. And, as a comparison, average sound levels produced by a live band are around 110 dBA.  

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), exposure to these noise levels can disturb sleep, raise blood pressure and even increase the chances of heart disease.  

The latest sound test was carried out by iClarified, and was a follow-up to a sound test the site filmed after the iPhone 5 was released in 2012. 

In the latest video, a decibel meter is placed beneath the speaker of each handset and music is played at full volume. 

The meter  presents the maximum reading in A-weighted decibels, or dBA.

This reading is used to show the relative loudness of a sound in the air, as it's perceived by the ear. 

iPhone 2G: 94.3 dBA

iPhone 3G: 98.6 dBA

iPhone 3GS: 103.6 dBA

iPhone 4: 92.9 dBA

iPhone 4S: 101.1 dBA

iPhone 5: 104.0 dBA

iPhone 5C: 102.0 dBA

iPhone 5S: 103.6 dBA

iPhone 6: 105.4 dBA

iPhone 6 Plus: 105.0 dBA 

Using this method, low frequency sounds are reduced, compared to unweighted decibels, because the ear doesn't hear lower frequencies as well as higher ones. 

A typical rating is around 25 dBA, which is 25 A-weighted decibels above the threshold of a person's hearing, and is said to be relative to the loudness of a person whispering in a quiet room. 

The meter changes position below the different handsets because the speaker changes position on each model, explained iClarified. 

The iPhone 6 had the loudest speakers on test, with a reading of 104.5 dBA, beating the larger Plus by 0.4 dBA. 

The iPhone 4 was the quietest, at 92.9 dBA, which was worse than the original 2G, which had a reading of 94.3 dBA.

The iPhone 5 was in third place on 104 dBA. The iPhone 3GS and 5S had the same reading, at 103.6 dBA, and the 5C registered a reading of 102 dBA. 

The speakers on the iPhone 3G produced 98.6 dBA. 

This isn't the first test in which the iPhone 4 performed worse than the original 2007 2G.

In 2013, fan site EverythingApplePro created a video test of eight handsets, including the 2G up to the 5S. 

Each of the handsets were 'freshly restored and not jailbroken' meaning they each had the same default settings and all applications were force closed beforehand. 

In the first test, all the phones were powered off simultaneously and the 3GS shut down fastest, followed by 3G, then the 4, then the original model.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 40 per cent of Europe’s population is exposed to noise levels in excess of 55dB - about the same level of a noisy office.

The average washing machine has a recorded sound level of 70dB, refrigerators average at around 50dB refrigerator while in some instances food processors can reach up to 90dB.

WHO says this amount of noise is enough to disturb sleep, raise blood pressure and even increase the chances of heart disease. 

According to a survey of 2,000 UK adults by John Lewis, 39 per cent of people will avoid using technology appliances at certain times because of the noise they produce.

Meanwhile, almost a third of people find it difficult to drown out the noise and almost half consider sound an important factor in their purchasing decision when buying home appliances. 

The worst offending items in the home, on average, include:

Food mixer - 90dB

Tumble dryer - 60dB

Washing machine - 70dB

Vacuum cleaner - 70dB

Refrigerator - 50dB

The newer handsets all took noticeably longer than the older models, but took exactly the same amount of time as each other, to the second. 

Each of the phones booted up at different times, but EverythingApplePro highlights that the models differ in the amount of processing power and RAM and software between the newest and oldest phones, meaning this was not unexpected.

This isn't the first test in which the iPhone 4 performed worse than the original 2007 2G. A video from EverythingApplePro found the original  retro model outperfomed more recent models in terms of performance. In tests,  newer models  booted up first, yet the original phone (far right) booted up faster than the iPhone 4

The newer models all booted up first, and at almost the same time, yet the original phone booted up faster than the iPhone 4. Apple's iPhone 3G was the slowest to boost.

In the final tests, EverythingApplePro launched the Reddit.com, and Apple.com websites.

The male voiceover explained that the 5S loads sites 'instantaneously' adding: 'the extra processing power and the new Wi-Fi capabilities, its an amazing device'.

When launching Reddit.com, the iPhone 5 beat the 5 and the voiceover continued the loading times go 'downhill' from there.

In conclusion, the video maker claimed: 'I learnt that the amount of processing power is greater as the generation goes on, but it's marginally less noticeable the higher you go, so if you have a 5 I wouldn't really recommend upgrading to a 5S just based on the fact you want extra amount of power, because it has an amazing amount of power as it is.'

In the final tests, EverythingApplePro launched the Reddit.com, and Apple.com websites, pictured. During  the video, the voiceover explained the 5S loads sites 'instantaneously'. When launching Reddit.com, the iPhone 5 beat the 5C but the rest of the handsets loaded the page slower than its successor
