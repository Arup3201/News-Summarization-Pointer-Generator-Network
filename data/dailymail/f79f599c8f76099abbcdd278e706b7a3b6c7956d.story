Two British teachers have broken the world record for the longest journey in a tuk-tuk despite their vehicle breaking down, forcing them to push it the last 43 miles.

Friends Richard Sears and Nick Gough have already travelled 2,330 miles, and if they can get their motorised rickshaw through northern Chile they will become the first people to drive a tuk-tuk around the world.

The pair have launched the charity long haul trek in aid of grassroots education projects in Africa, Asia and South America.

Nick Gough takes his turn to haul the broken down tuk tuk in the Sechura Desert. The pair have already travelled 2,330 miles (37,500km) in aid of grassroots education projects in Africa, Asia and South America

The pair, who set off from London on August 13 last year, thought their expedition was over when the vehicle started to fail.

But after three days' pushing to the Peruvian city of Chepen they found a mechanic specialising in tuk-tuks and will now press on through the Andes.

Mr Gough, who was born in Bath, said: 'Although there have been many testing times, we have been privileged to experience such wonderful places and meet some truly remarkable individuals.'

The expedition, sponsored by Cardiff University and freight company DSV, lets followers in the first world donate directly to the education projects it visits across the global south.

The two said they had worked with slum children in Cairo, Khartoum, Kampala, Mumbai and Phnom Penh, as well as visiting refugee camps in the Congo and meeting survivors of the Rwandan genocide in the country's capital of Kigali.

They also visited adult education projects for sex workers in Delhi and victims of human trafficking in Nepal.

Mr Sears, who was born in Bath and raised in Guildford, said: "The world's leaders have made a commitment to achieving universal primary education by 2015.

'But despite this pledge over 57 million primary-aged children worldwide are still out of school. Many more are in school though still cannot access quality learning opportunities.'

Their tuk-tuk was struck by a lorry in Malaysia and harassed by elephants in Botswana, but mountain crossings remained its toughest challenge.

Mr Sears and Mr Gough said they chose the impractical vehicle due to its 'slow-paced, open and friendly nature', allowing them to engage with locals more easily.

Their record will only be official when they reach the end of their journey and are verified by the Guinness Book of Records. The incumbents are Germans Susi Bemsei and Daniel Snaider, who travelled 2,324 miles (37,410km) in 2005.

The men, who are both 28 and have both taught at the Royal Grammar School in Guildford, drove a four-stroke Piaggio Ape D3S with a top speed of 55kph which they have christened Tommy.

Tommy's low emissions mean they have been able to offset their carbon footprint by 110 per cent using 'avoided deforestation', which lets developing countries claim compensation for not clearing rainforest.

In March the international educational campaigners became the first to drive a Tuk Tuk the length of Africa at the Cape of Good Hope

Mr Sears said he was inspired to campaign for education rights after working for a French NGO in Cambodia's north-eastern Ratanakiri project in 2008.

He said: 'The school was one room, completely dilapidated, with holes in the walls and roof. It was full of children, though, from babies to 19 or 20-year-olds.

'They were sat in lines on benches, with desks in front of them and a teacher in the corner at the front of the room. 

'There was a blackboard, but no chalk, pens, pencils, books or learning materials of any kind. The teacher didn't even speak the same language as the students.

'Education plays a critical role in development, and these children, though they had access to schooling, had no opportunity to learn and fulfil their potential. It's impossible not to be moved by something like that.

Mr Sears said education was not 'a miraculous weapon' against poverty but played a 'crucial role' as an 'enabler' of human rights.
