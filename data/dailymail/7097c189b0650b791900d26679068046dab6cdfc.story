Teenage winger Callum Lancaster grabbed two tries as Hull eased back to winning ways with a 50-12 victory over the 12-man Broncos in London.

Lancaster, 17, bagged a try in each half on just his second senior appearance as the Black and Whites sentenced the Londoners, who had Scott Moore dismissed just before the break, to their 15th successive Super League defeat.

Joe Westerman also added a brace for Hull, who outscored their opponents nine tries to two in a largely one-sided encounter.

Ahead of kick-off, Nesiasi Mataitonga moved from full-back to a first start at stand-off for the hosts, while James Greenwood replaced Olsi Krasniqi at prop.

Hull made two changes of their own, Ben Crooks and Chris Tuson coming in for former Bronco Liam Colbon and Dean Hadley respectively.

Despite putting London to the sword 40-4 on their own turf five weeks ago, Hull entered the contest on the back of four straight defeats.

And they were on the back foot here within six minutes, Greenwood charging down Jordan Rankin's clearing kick and flopping over the line for the opening score.

Hull were mightily close to hauling themselves level when Mason Caton-Brown hauled down Crooks as he looked to cross in the corner.

But the reprieve proved temporary for the home side as Mataitonga's spill was seized on by Gareth Ellis, who cantered over the line on 12 minutes to help level the scores.

It was real end-to-end stuff, with London's Denny Solomona and Hull's Lancaster both having tries chalked off for forward passes.

Lancaster was not to be denied on 22 minutes though, taking a pass from Kirk Yeaman to ease in at the corner.

Hull were growing in stature, with the Londoners being forced back thanks to a string of penalties.

And the Black and Whites cashed in one such infringement for their third try, Westerman stepping inside and out to rumble over the line from close range.

Handling errors were continuing to dog the Broncos, and, after the hosts once again knocked on in their own territory, Jamie Shaul raced in at the corner after a flowing handling move involving Crooks and Yeaman to help make it 22-6.

Much-needed: The win ended a run of four successive defeats for Hull and continued London Broncos' misery

Things went from bad to worse for London moments later, with hooker Moore seeing red after a hit on Lancaster.

To their credit, London emerged fired up for the second half, despite being consistently penalised by referee George Stokes.

And the Broncos converted that tempo into points when Caton-Brown powered over after a short pass from George Griffin on 47 minutes.

Hull, having really taken their foot off the gas, finally sprang back into life midway through the half, Liam Watts breaking the London defence and offloading for Danny Houghton to cruise over.

The visitors were on the front foot again, Lancaster close to claiming his second score when his lunge for the line came up inches short.

But a sixth try did come for Hull on 66 minutes, Westerman notching his second when he shrugged off weak Broncos tackling to stride over.

By now it was a case of how many tries Hull would run in, and Lancaster got his name on the scoresheet again when Yeaman's pass gave him a free run to the corner.

There was still time for Hull to run in two further late tries, Rankin and Fetuli Talanoa crossing after good work from Shaul and Jacob Miller respectively.
