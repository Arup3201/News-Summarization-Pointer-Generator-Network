Fashion student Wilson PK thought he was going gaga when a superstar singer asked him to send over his designs.

The 23-year-old was approached by Lady Gaga's stylists who noticed his designs on show at a New York exhibition. At the time, Wilson PK was working for designer Alexander Wang in New York. 

Lady Gaga then wore the fashionista's bright orange knit suit when she landed in South Korea last week.

The graduate of Central St Martins in London said the singer's entourage asked him to send over his entire collection.

Lady Gaga later posted photos of Wilson's work on her Instagram page and wrote 'stunning young recent graduate.'

Wilson, who is originally from Hong Kong but now lives in London says: 'It's a huge honour. This was the best thing that could have happened.

'It was really incredible because she mentioned my name, which she doesn't usually do, and she called me a stunning student. I feel very lucky.

'I think she is amazing. She is doing something different and is showing a new aspect of beautiful.'

Wilson explained the inspiration for this collection came from his experience of coming out to his parents.

He added: 'They took it really hard - they almost wanted to disown me. For me this collection was very therapeutic.'

Wilson's former fashion and textile teacher at Cambridge Centre for sixth form studies, Charlotte Denton-Cowell, said there was 'never a dull moment' with him in her classes.

She explained: 'We always knew he would make it big, Lady Gaga wearing his recent outfits will give him fantastic exposure and most certainly give his career a major kick start.'
