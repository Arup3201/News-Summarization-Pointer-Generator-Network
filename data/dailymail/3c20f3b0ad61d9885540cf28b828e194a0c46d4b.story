Miley Cyrus also took flak from angry parents for appearing to wear a costume emblazoned with a cannabis design

Miley Cyrus’s critics may have dismissed her outrageous stage antics as soft porn – but the defiant star insists she is an artist trying to educate children.

The American singer’s Bangerz tour, which kicked off in Canada on Valentine’s Day, has drawn complaints from parents who have taken offence at Cyrus miming a sex act with a man wearing a Bill Clinton mask and dancing in a glittering leotard decorated with cannabis leaves.

But the 21-year-old, who caused a sensation when she ‘twerked’ on stage with Robin Thicke at last year’s MTV awards said she was working her ‘ass off’ to be ‘a better person’.

She said:  ‘I want this to be a pretty high-end tour. I want it to be like good art.

'And I am excited to go to places where people are usually not exposed to too much good art. It can be a good education for the kids who come to my concert.’

She added: ‘I want to show people that music can not only be entertaining but educational as well.

‘Maybe people don’t think of me first when it comes to education, but I might surprise a couple of people.’

Miley Cyrus claims that her appearances on stage are not, as many have claimed, blatant sexuality for its own sake, but instead are her attempts at experimental art

Cyrus has said she is a hard worker, but that she does not have many friends

She said: ‘Look, I am not the little girl any more. I think everybody knows that by now. I want to be my own person, I want to change all the time to become a better artist, a better person. I work my ass off, and I like who I am.’

Cyrus claims that she finds what young girls are wearing today 'boring' and that they should try to be more experimental

The star said it was time that young girls, including her own fans, became more adventurous.

She said: ‘I like to experiment. I like to try new things. I don’t understand what most girls are wearing today.

'I find it boring. Why don’t younger children try to be more risque. I like  it when you find a style that can be your own personal style.’

The singer also revealed that she didn’t have that many friends.

‘I am a pretty honest person. I like people who don’t lie to me.

'And I want to laugh. So, if you are funny, and you can make me laugh, you are good in my book. I don’t have that many friends.’

Cyrus, who is due to bring her tour to
 Britain in May, said her critics had to appreciate she was no longer 
the child star she used to be. She made her name as a teenager in the 
Disney TV show Hannah Montana.
