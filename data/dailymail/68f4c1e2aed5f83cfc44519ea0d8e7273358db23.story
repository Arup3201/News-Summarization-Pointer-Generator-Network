A 'terrorist' Palestinian used a digger to mow down and kill an Israeli before overturning a bus on a main Jerusalem street today, Israeli police said.

There were no passengers on the bus, in an ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighbourhood of the city. 

Surveillance video broadcast on Israeli television showed the yellow excavator's mechanical arm tearing into the side of the bus as it lay on the pavement.

Police shot the driver dead and later announced he was a Palestinian from East Jerusalem - they described the incident as a terrorist attack.

Later, a motorcyclist shot and wounded a man on another Jerusalem street, the Magen David Adom ambulance service said. 

There were no immediate claims of responsibility for Monday's attacks in the city.

But a spokesman for Hamas, the dominant group in the Gaza Strip, said: 'We praise the heroic and brave operations in Jerusalem, which come as a natural reaction to the crimes and massacres by the Occupation against our people in Gaza.' 

Tensions have been high in Jerusalem for the past month over the Gaza war and the killing of a Palestinian teen in the city by alleged Israeli assailants out to avenge the deaths of three abducted Israeli youngsters in the occupied West Bank.

Yossi Farienti, Jerusalem district police chief, said the excavator 'hit a Jewish citizen at a construction site and then drove about 50 metres (yards) down the road, where it overturned the bus with its arm, slightly injuring three people'.

A police spokesman said police officers shot at the driver, killing him. 

TV footage showed the man's body hanging out of the excavator's cabin.

Internal Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch said the nearly four-week-old Gaza war had also raised fears of attacks in Israeli cities.

'From the moment fighting started in the south, we realised such an incident of a lone attacker can happen and such tractor attacks are familiar in Jerusalem,' Aharonovitch said on Channel 2 television.

'(The driver's) whole family is being interrogated. We want to know who sent him, if he was acting alone, whether he belonged to a network - all those things are being checked,' he said.

In two incidents in July 2008, construction vehicles driven by Palestinians hit Israeli buses and pedestrians, killing a total of three people. In both incidents, the attackers were shot dead.

Three years later, an Arab truck driver drove into cars and pedestrians in Tel Aviv, killing one person, in what police said was a deliberate attack. 

The driver was apprehended and sentenced to life imprisonment.
