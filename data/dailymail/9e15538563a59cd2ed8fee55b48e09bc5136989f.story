Harry Kane has penned a new contract at Tottenham which will keep him at the club until 2019.

The England Under 21 striker was a peripheral figure at White Hart Lane but impressed last season with three Premier League goals in seven games.

And Kane has been rewarded with a five-year deal.

Before his breakthrough season, Kane enjoyed loan spells at Leyton Orient, Millwall, Norwich and Leicester.
