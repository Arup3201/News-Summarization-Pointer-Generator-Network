George Zimmerman's wife today lambasted her husband as 'selfish' and said he believes he is invincible since being acquitted of murdering Trayvon Martin last year.

Speaking in an exclusive television interview revealing why she has filed for divorce, Shellie Zimmerman said her husband was forever changed by the fame that came with the high-profile case.

'In my opinion, he feels more invincible' since the court case, the 26-year-old said in the interview with Good Morning America on Friday. 'I think he's just making some reckless decisions.'

George Zimmerman, 29, made headlines again this week after he was caught speeding - the second time since he was acquitted of second-degree murder in July.

Anger: Shellie Zimmerman spoke out about her divorce from George Zimmerman on Friday morning and said he now believes he is invincible since being acquitted of second-degree murder

The couple, who have been married nearly seven years, separated August 13 - a month after he was found not guilty - and she filed for divorce on the grounds that their marriage is 'irretrievably broken'.

'I have a selfish husband,' she said. 'I think George is all about George.'

She said that he developed a temper and 'beat her down' - while she remained by his side during the lengthy trial that sent them both into hiding 
when George became a symbol of racial tension.

'I stood by my husband through everything
and I feel like he left me with a bunch of pieces of broken glass that 
I'm supposed to now assemble and make a life,' she told Good Morning America.

'I have supported him for so long and 
neglected myself for too long and I feel like I'm finally starting to 
feel empowered again.'

By his side: She said she remained supportive of George Zimmerman (pictured at Seminole circuit court in Sanford, Florida in June) but he beat her down and shattered her self esteem

She is now wanting custody of their dogs - a Rottweiller named Oso and a mixed breed named Leroy - and a share of the money he gets from a lawsuit against NBC.

It was also revealed this week that she is reaping more than $4,000-a-month from his defense fund despite splitting from him weeks after he was cleared.

TMZ revealed on Thursday that she is collecting the $4,300 stipend to cover her 'living expenses'.

Zimmerman had raised some $300,000 to be used for his 'ongoing living expenses, legal costs, and fees for this matter', according to the solicitation on PayPal.

More confusing still, his legal 
defense website says: 'Currently George and Shellie are renting a secure
residence at a reasonable rate. Their day-to-day living expenses are 
relatively modest as they want to preserve as many funds as possible for
an aggressive defense.'

Shellie,
who told the court that she was two months shy of earning her 
registered nurse's license before dropping out of school, has no income 
and six-figure debts.

According to the Orlando Sentinel, she has $103,756 in debt due to school and car loans as well as credit card bills. Her $12,729 in assets is attributed largely to her Honda Accord.

Shellie,
26, also spoke to Good Morning America and told how the death threats that 
he husband received following Trayvon's slaying forced them to live 'pretty much Gypsies for
the past year'.

'We lived in a 20-foot trailer in the woods, scared every night that someone would find us and it would be horrific,' she said in the interview which aired on August 28.

She appeared at every court hearing for him before he was acquitted of second degree murder.  

Even now, she stands by his actions that night, when the neighborhood watch volunteer confronted a teenager he thought looked suspicious who was walking through his neighborhood.

When asked if she thought George had targeted Trayvon and murdered him in cold blood, she he's 'not capable' that kind of behavior.

Plea Deal: Shellie Zimmerman, wife of George Zimmerman, and her attorney Kelly Sims exit the courtroom at the Seminole County Courthouse in Sanford, Fla. on Wednesday, Aug. 28, 2013

With the exception of his latest speeding ticket, George Zimmerman's legal worries are currently over.

The same is not true for Shellie, however, as she appeared in court in late August to enter a guilty plea to lying under oath.

She
admitted that she lied when asked about she and George's financial 
situation when he was trying to meet bail after being arrested for the 
shooting death of Trayvon Martin.

'By
lying under oath, I let my God down, I let your Honor and the court 
down, I let my family and friends down, and, most of all, I let myself 
down,' she wrote in an apology letter.

She
received 100 hours of community service and a year of probation, which 
she plans to fulfill with community service at a Christian ministry.
