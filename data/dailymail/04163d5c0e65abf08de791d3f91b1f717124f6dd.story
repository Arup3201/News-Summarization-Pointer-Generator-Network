A Charlotte couple found dead in their home in February died of heroin overdoses and not carbon monoxide poisoning as once suspected, according to an autopsy report released Wednesday.

According to the N.C. Medical Examiner, both Travis Wayne Edwards, 22, and Ashley Erin Edwards, 20, had fatal levels of 6-monoacetylmorphine, which indicates heroin use.

Their bodies were discovered by a family member on the morning of Feb. 7 lying side by side in bed, each wearing pajamas.

The pair had a daughter who was not home at the time of their deaths.

Because a gas leak had been reported in a neighborhood home only hours before the bodies were found, there was speculation they may have been the victims of carbon monoxide poisoning.

'Passersby were calling it in,' said Chris Brad, assistant chiefÂ       at the Cook Volunteer Fire Department. 'With the wind, the smell would come and go.'

The Gaston Gazette reported that tests to measure gas in the house's air came back negative.

Also, a blood test failed to find evidence of elevated levels of gas in their systems, the Charlotte Observer reported.

Foul play is not suspected.

Ashely 
Edwards had several drugs in her system, including hydrocodone, 
morphine, oxycodone, and dextromethorphan, which is often present in 
over-the-counter cough medicines.

Urine samples showed Travis Edwards had recently ingested codein and dextromethorphan.

According to a Facebook page, the Edwards moved to town just one day before the overdoses.

The couple left behind a young daughter who the family has established a trust for

Travis worked at Stephens Contracting Co. and was an avid hunter and fisherman.

Erin liked to sing and dance, and was a hairstylist at Sport Clips.

The family has established a trust for the pair's young daughter.
