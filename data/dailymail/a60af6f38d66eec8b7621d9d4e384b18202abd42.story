The Duggar family - who shot to fame with the TLC reality series 19 Kids and Counting - promotes not only abstinence until marriage, but also kissing and even hugging, which makes it incredibly shocking that the sister of patriarch Jim Bob has a daughter out of wedlock.

It seems that cousin Amy, who has appeared on the show and is the daughter of Jim's sister Deanna, was born when her mother was not married and, what's more, though it may seem as if her husband, Terry Jordan, is Amy's biological father, that may not be the case.

In fact, a 2012 interview in which Terry said he and Deanna had been dating for 20 years, which would be five years after Amy, 27, was born, seems to confirm that he is not her father.

'Terry and I knew each other a long time ago, and I got pregnant with Amy. And so, we dated each other on and off for quite some time,' Deanna said in a 2009 interview on the show, according to Radar Online.

'Then we finally decided you know what, we need to get married! So we got married, we’ve been together 3 years.'

The couple did wed in 2006, and while that may seem against the Duggar family principles, Jim Bob still very much loves his sister.

'We enjoy getting together every week.'

This comes hot on the heels on the revelation that Michelle, the matriarch of the family, has a sister who is a lesbian.

Michelle has never said much of the woman, Evelyn Ruark, who did appear in an early episode of the show without her partner, but her sister has called their lifestyle a cult.

We are worried about them,’ said her partner Sharon Callahan. 

‘We have often thought that Quiverfull is a cult. It appears to be brainwashing to me.’

What's more, it is uncertain who Amy's biological father is as she is 27 and Deanna's has only been with her husband Terry for 22 years

This goes against the Duggar family principles, where even hugging before marriage is not allowed
