England and Scotland fans have been advised to leave extra time when travelling to Tuesday’s friendly at Celtic Park.

A number of Scotland fans complained on Twitter at missing kick off for Friday’s Euro 2016 qualifier with Ireland with some supporters claiming they were still queuing outside Celtic Park up to 30 minutes after kick off.

Friday night’s problems are being blamed on heavy tragic on the A9 around the ground and the late arrival of fans.

Some fans complained that they missed 30 minutes of action on Friday due to delays getting into Celtic Park

And fans are being advised to leave extra time to get to the ground to avoid a repeat of the problems.

The FA have sold 5,077 of their 7,200 away ticket allocation and all travelling fans have to collect their tickets in Glasgow due to ongoing security procedures.

But The FA opened their ticket collection point in Glasgow city centre at 4pm on Monday and it will be open until 5pm on Tuesday.

There will also be a ticket collection point for England fans at Celtic Park up until 8pm and despite every travelling fan having to collect their tickets, The FA insist it is ‘standard practice’ to stop ticket touting and they are not anticipating any problems.
