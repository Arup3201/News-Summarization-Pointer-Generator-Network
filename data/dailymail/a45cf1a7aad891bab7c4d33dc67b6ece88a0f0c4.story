A triple murderer who received an £800 payout for lost or damaged belongings was a serial claimant, it has emerged.

Kevan Thakrar, 26, also pocketed £75 in a 2011 compensation case – for missing milk.

The judge who handed the machine-gun killer his latest payout for damaged property, including nasal hair clippers, also presided over the earlier case.

Triple killer: Kevan Thakrar was jailed for murdering three men over a £10,000 cocaine debt

Thakrar complained that ten cartons of
 soya milk and ten of long-life milk, along with some toiletries had 
disappeared as he was transferred between prisons.

District
 Judge Neil Hickman awarded him £50 to replace them and a further £25 
compensation because losing the items caused him ‘distress’ and made his
 time in jail ‘more unpleasant than it should have been’.

In addition to
 claims for money, Thakrar has made nearly 250 complaints to the Prisons
 Ombudsman in recent years – a body which receives only 5,000 complaints
 from prisoners a year.

Yesterday
 it emerged Thakrar was accused of assaulting a woman police officer 
only weeks ago in Manchester prison.

Victim: Former prison officer Craig Wylde was attacked by Kevan Thakrar with a broken botyle, leaving the 32-year-old with cuts that reached the bone in his arm and causing him to lose eight pints of blood

Injuries: Mr Wylde was one of three prison guards attacked by triple killer Kevan Thakrar, using a weapon made from a 285ml chilli sauce glass bottle

The gangland murderer poured 
excrement and urine over her – but staggeringly he is not being 
prosecuted.

In 2012 Thakrar attacked three prison officers with a glass bottle in an unprovoked attack but was cleared of attempted murder.

Last
 night one of his victims, Craig Wylde, revealed he is yet to receive a 
penny in compensation despite being unable to work since the assault.

The
 32-year-old said: ‘My future is ruined and he has got sympathy handouts
 and I haven’t even had a sorry. I’m worried about my children’s future 
because if I had been working I could have picked up the extra shifts 
and worked harder to provide for them. I could have worked for another 
35 years.’

Of Thakrar’s 
£800 award, £500 was given because officers did not apologise to him.

Mr
 Wylde added: ‘It is upsetting they are trying to save every penny when 
it comes to giving me any compensation but at the same time are 
rewarding him £500 in sympathy.’

He
 and his pregnant wife Kat, 32, a community mental health nurse, have a 
two-year-old and a newborn baby – but were forced to move into his 
parents’ house in December as they were struggling financially.

Peter
 McParlin, chairman of the Prison Officers Association, said the award 
for the nasal clippers and other items was ‘ridiculous’ and 
‘disproportionate'.

‘This is a high-security prisoner. As a 
bare minimum he will be costing the taxpayer £50,000 a year to be kept 
incarcerated,’ he added.

At the time 
of Thakrar’s earlier claim, the Prisons Ombudsman said there was ‘no 
evidence’ of any milk in the cell when it was cleared and ordered a £10 
payout for the toiletries.

But Judge Hickman overturned this, saying the
 £10 figure had been ‘plucked out of the air’.

‘And being deprived of his toiletries… will have made his incarceration more unpleasant than it should have been,’ he added.

Thakrar
 was jailed for 35 years for the machine-gun murder in 2008 of three men
 in Bishop Stortford, Hertfordshire, over a £10,000 drug debt.

As a result of attacking three guards, the killer was transferred from Frankland prison, in County Durham, pictured, to Woodhill in Milton Keynes
