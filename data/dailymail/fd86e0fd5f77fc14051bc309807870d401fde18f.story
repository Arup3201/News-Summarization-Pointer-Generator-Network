Britain's elite airborne force is to be cut by a third as the government slashes Armed Forces jobs.

As part of the coalition's drive to reduce the Army from 102,000 regulars 
to just 82,000, the 16 Air Assault Brigade will be stripped of half of its regular infantry battalions.

The brigade, which is the Army's rapid response airborne formation and encompasses the Parachute Regiment battalions, will also lose air power, artillery and armoured vehicles.

Sources within the brigade - the largest in the British Army - estimate that it will have lost almost 3,000 of its 8,000 personnel by the end of December.

The changes were first outlined in 2013 following the Army 2020 study, which revealed how the government intended to make the Army 'smaller, integrated and more adaptable'.

It is hoped that the cuts will shave £10billion from the Ministry of Defence budget, although there have been concerns over the reduction in numbers in the face of any potential future conflicts.

Details of the cuts to 16
 Air Assault Brigade, and the timescale in which they will be implemented, have now emerged in an issue of the Parachute Regiment’s journal and in an internal 
briefing.

By the end of the year infantry units the 1st and 2nd Battalions the Royal Irish Regiment will leave the brigade, which has served in each of the Army's recent deployments to Sierra Leone, Macedonia, Iraq and Afghanistan, for a lower readiness force, according to the Sunday Telegraph.

Fifth Battalion the Royal Regiment of Scotland, which had been part of 
the brigade, has been disbanded apart from a single public duties company.

Armoured
 reconnaissance vehicles from the Household Cavalry 
Regiment, where Prince Harry is an officer, are also being reassigned 
and the brigade, based in Colchester, Essex,  is set to lose artillery, 
engineers and helicopters.

Former Parachute Regiment officer and Labour MP, Dan
 Jarvis, said the cuts were 'baffling'.

'The
 drawdown in Afghanistan means our focus now pivots towards contingency 
operations with 16 Air Assault set to play a lead role within that,' he told the Sunday Telegraph.

'It’s
 therefore baffling why, just at the point where we start to focus on 
contingency operations, cuts are being made that will undermine the 
deployability and combat effectiveness of the brigade.'

As part of the Army 2020 programme, it is hoped that the shortfall caused by the loss of 20,000 regulars will be made up by a newly renamed Army Reserve, formerly the 
Territorial Army.

The Navy will lose 5,500 
sailors and the Royal Air Force is to be cut by 8,000.

There have been four tranches of redundancies, although the most recent, announced in January is expected to be the final round.

Battalions earmarked to be disbanded in the July 2012 study are now in the process of winding up, and some have already been absorbed into other regiments.

Plans to disband the 2nd Battalion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers was met with protests from former soldiers, who marched on parliament in an attempt to save the battalion - of which Drummer Lee Rigby was a member.

However, this summer the regiment's 1st and 2nd Battalions will merge to form the new First
 Fusiliers, with the second battalion removed from the Army's order of 
battle on August 31.

Earlier this month MPs warned that the armed forces could face further cuts because of a £1.2million underspend by the MoD.

In 
December last year, General Sir Nick Houghton, Chief of the Defence 
Staff, said there was a huge danger Britain would have too much 
state-of-the-art equipment but not enough troops to man it.

In
 a damning assessment of government plans, he said: 'Our current course 
leads to a strategically incoherent force structure - exquisite 
equipment, but insufficient resources to man that equipment or train. It
 is what the Americans call the spectre of the "hollow force".'

Yesterday serving Navy Vice Admiral Simon Lister launched a scathing 
attack on the state of the Royal Navy, claiming it has been reduced to a
 collection of broken-down ships and ageing submarines whose crews are 
demoralised and poorly trained.

Writing
 in a military journal, he said: ‘The price of unrelenting operational 
tempo is unsustainable pressure on engineers as every opportunity for 
maintenance is squeezed out of busy programmes.

‘For example, the lack of operators trained to stream and recover Type 23 towed sonar.

‘Overall
 material readiness continues to decline. From the submarine 
perspective, the numbers of force elements at readiness have been driven
 low by late delivery of Astute [a new model of submarine] and platform 
ageing.

‘Support is increasingly over-reliant on [civilians] for repair. This philosophy builds in declining competence and confidence.’

Colonel
 Tim Collins of 1st Battalion Royal Irish Regiment, part of 16 Air 
Assault Brigade during the war in Iraq, said: 'The Army is now of a size where it’s hard to call it an army.
 It’s more of a defence force.'

An Army spokesman told MailOnline: 'Difficult decisions were taken in the 2010 SDSR to ensure we can properly equip the Army for the future.

'Changes to the structure and size of 16 Air Assault Brigade were announced in 2013 and implemented as part of wider changes that will ensure the Army is more flexible and better able to meet future threats.

'It will remain the Army’s premier high readiness formation and will be able to draw on support from other divisions and support units should this be required.

'This is at the heart of creating a more adaptable force and will have no impact on our operational effectiveness.'
