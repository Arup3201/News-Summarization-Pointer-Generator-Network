A veteran cop and married father of three shot himself on his way home from work yesterday, becoming the fourth NYPD police officer to take his own life in less than a month.

Highway-safety officer Matthew Schindler, 39, pulled onto the side of the Long Island Expressway near Exit 40 in Jericho at 4.30pm on his way back from a shift in Queens before shooting himself under the chin.

Minutes earlier the 14-year veteran, described by a friend as an 'an all-around great guy' had texted his sergeant to say he wouldn't be seeing him any more.

His fellow officers were ordered back to the 115th Precinct stationhouse, where flags were lowered to half mast, to be told the tragic news.

According to the New York Post, when told the distressing news Bill Genet, the head of volunteer group Poppa that helps troubled police officers, exclaimed: 'Oh, God, not another one.'

Schindler is the second NYPD officer to commit suicide in eight days and the fourth since the start of the year.

On February 5, 20-year veteran Brian Saar, a father of twin five-year-old daughters, shot himself at his home in Suffolk County after apparently arguing with his wife at a party.

On January 19, officer Terrence Dean, 28, shot himself with his service pistol while on duty at the scene of a Queens car burglary after getting a phone call from his fiancée Maria Stuart, urging him to get help for his severe depression.

According to Ms Stuart he replied: 'Fine, I'm going to kill myself,' before pointing his gun at his head and pulling the trigger.

Minutes earlier Ms Stuart had called the precinct to leave an anonymous tip warning that one of the their officers was suicidal.

She said that in the days leading up to the suicide, Dean had threatened to kill himself and those around him a number of times. The day before he died, Dean threatened to kill himself by putting his gun in his mouth while at home with Ms Stuart.

Ms Stuart said that part of the reason why he was depressed was because he felt that his family had pressured him into becoming a police officer instead of pursuing his dream of being a fire fighter.

On Jan. 15, rookie Patrick Werner, 23, killed himself at his parents’ home in Yorktown Heights after fleeing from a car accident.
