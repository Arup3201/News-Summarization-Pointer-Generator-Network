Fugitive software tycoon John McAfee claims he used a body double carrying a North Korean passport to escape from Belize where he fears being executed for the murder of an American businessman.

The eccentric millionaire, 67, is currently believed to be on the run in Guatemala with a 20-year-old female companion called Sam and two journalists from the arts and culture magazine Vice.

A post on his own blog, uploaded over the weekend, claimed he had been arrested attempting to cross into Mexico, although officials in Belize denied this was the case.

Latest twist: Fugitive software developer John McAfee, says
 he has escaped Belize after his body double, who was carrying a North Korean passport, was arrested on the Mexican border

Wish you were here? McAfee appeared to be hiding out at a home in Guatemala (pinpointed by the red dot) after a photo of him contained data of map coordinates

But in a later blog entry, McAfee appears to suggest this was all part of a cunning ruse involving the use of a body double.

The
 post reads: 'We are not in Belize, but not quite out of the woods yet. 
 I will do a more detailed posting later today if all goes well. 

'My "double", carrying on (sic) a North Korean passport under my name, was 
in fact detained in Mexico for pre-planned misbehavior, but due to 
indifference on the part of authorities was evicted from the jail and 
was unable to serve his intended purpose in our exit plan. 

'He is now safely out of Mexico.'

It is not known whether there is any truth in these claims or indeed if the posts were uploaded by McAfee himself.

Where in the world is he? A new photo published online today appears to show that John McAfee is in Guatemala

Is the game up? Several Twitter followers quickly noticed that the metadata in Vice's photo showed its location in Guatemala

McAfee did not describe the entire plan,
 nor did he say where exactly he was now. In a previous interview, 
McAfee had said he had no plans to leave Belize.

'I'm not going to leave this 
country,' he said. 'I love this country, this is my home. I intend to 
fight the injustice that's here from here, I can't do much from outside,
 can I?'

It is the latest bizarre twist in the increasingly peculiar story of 
the eccentric anti-virus company founder wanted for questioning in 
connection with the killing of neighbour Gregory Viant Faull.

Police in Belize have called him a 
'person of interest' in the killing of Faull and asked him to turn himself in for questioning.

Faull
 was shot to death in early November. McAfee acknowledges that the man had
 complained about his dogs, which were poisoned shortly before Faull's death but says he didn't kill him.

Online magazine Vice has claimed to 
be in the company of McAfee since he went on the run following the death
 of an American expat on November 10.

In an earlier incident,  Mr McAfee appeared to have inadvertently 
given up his whereabouts after a photo of him was posted online using 
an iPhone 4S which includes details of the location it was taken.

Pastime: Gregory Faull posted several pictures of himself on his boat in Belize. He titled this photo 'new friends'

On the run: John McAfee, seen here just days before the murder of his neighbor, claims he is being set up by the Belizean government

The photo of Vice editor Rocco 
Castoro alongside McAfee, included metadata pinpointing their exact 
location to a Guatemalan mansion surrounded by forest at the edge of the
 sea.

However the 
millionaire then quickly posted on his blog an 'apology' to Vice for 
manipulating their photo's location for his own safety.

In an email, McAfee confirmed a 
posting to his website in which he described, in what appeared to be 
joking tones, how he mounted the ruse.

In Monday's post, McAfee said he left
 Belize because he thought 'Sam', the young Belizean woman who has 
accompanied him since he went on the lam, was in danger.

He
 wrote: 'I left Belize because of a series of events which led both Sam 
and I to believe that she was in danger of capture. She has been my 
go-between and my eyes and ears in the outside world.

'I
 decided to make the move. I will be returning to Belize after I have 
place (sic) Sam in a safe position. My fight is in Belize, and I can do 
little in exile.'

Police sources in Belize said earlier today that they believed he was still in the country.

The sparsely populated border between Mexico and Belize is unguarded and unmarked in many places.

Rumors arose over the weekend that McAfee had been caught, but Belizean police quickly denied that. MacAfee has said he won't turn himself in because he fears he will be killed by Belizean police while in custody.

Belize's prime minister, Dean Barrow, has expressed doubts about McAfee's mental state: 'I don't want to be unkind to the gentleman, but I believe he is extremely paranoid, even bonkers.'

McAfee, who is extremely polite and coherent in telephone conversations, brushes off such accusations, telling the AP 'if people want to call that paranoia, they can do so if you wish, that will not concern me'.

Paradise lost: McAfee claims to have left Belize whereas police said he was still in the country

McAfee, the creator of the McAfee antivirus program, has led an eccentric life since he sold his stake in the anti-virus software company that is named after him in the early 1990s and moved to Belize about three years ago to lower his taxes.

December 1: Reports that McAfee has been captured on the border of Mexico and Belize prove false

December 3: McAfee posts bizarre blog post saying that he has escaped Belize with the help of a 'body double' ruse in Mexico. Later Vice magazine posts picture of him with map coordinates in Guatemala - which McAfee immediately says has been faked  'for his own safety'

He told The New York Times in 2009 that he had lost all but $4 million of his $100 million fortune in the U.S. financial crisis.

However, a story on the Gizmodo website quoted him as calling that claim 'not very accurate at all'.

He has dabbled in yoga, ultra-light aircraft and producing herbal medications.

McAfee has never said where he's hiding. But in his blog, he has claimed to have disguised himself as a grungy street peddler and a foul-mouthed German tourist.

McAfee's blog, whoismcafee.com, was updated on Monday shortly after noon with a message titled 'I am safe'.

McAfee has frequently used the rambling blog to keep the world updated on his bizarre attempts to evade capture in the Central American nation, which have included dressing in outlandish disguises and swapping cell phones over to avoid satellite detection.

McAfee has been the subject of police interest since his neighbor,Gregory Faull, a 
52-year-old contractor from Florida, was discovered with a bullet in his head on November 11.

In the brief talk with a CNN reporter
 last week, McAfee said: 'I will certainly not turn myself in, and I 
will certainly not quit fighting. I will not stop my blog.'

Claiming
 that he will either be arrested or get away, clarifying 'Get away 
doesn't mean leave the country.

'It means they will, No.1, find the 
murderer of Mr. Faull and, No.2, the people of this country - who are by
 and large terrified to speak out - start speaking out.'

McAfee and Faull repeatedly had 
run-ins with each other the dogs that the multi-millionaire owned and in
 one interview with Wired claimed that the killers of Mr Faull were 
looking for him in fact and not his unfortunate neighbou.

In
 fact, the last six months have proven to be one odd episode after 
another for McAfee, which began in May when his home was raided and 
police said they found multiple firearms and the 67-year-old living with
 a 17-year-old girl.

The CNN report also noted that police in Belize have said they don't consider 
McAfee a suspect in the killing; they say they only want him for questioning.
