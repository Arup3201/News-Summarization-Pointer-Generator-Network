Wayne Rooney may be used to a top-of-the-range Land Rover, but the Manchester United star looked at home in the drivers seat of a fire engine.

United stars paid a visit to Beverly Hills Fire Department as they got their pre-season tour of the USA underway.

The fully kitted-out players, including Rooney, Darren Fletcher, Shinji Kagawa and David de Gea, posed in front of the engine before signing balls for new sponsors Chevrolet.

But they had to go there, somehow, so what better way to give your mates a lift than to do it in your own open-top white Chevrolet?

With Fletcher driving, and Rooney claiming the front seat, they made their way to the fire department.
