Six-year-old Da Mao was filmed having a blast in the freshly fallen snow at the Toronto Zoo on Monday morning.

Surveillance footage shows him  doing some backward rolls in his outdoor enclosure with his legs comically flipping up in the air.

He later takes to a steep slope and bravely tumbles down on his back and bottom.

When he hits the base of the hill, he lumbers back up and goes for another run.

Keepers at the zoo said Da Mao appeared to be 'bear-bogganing.'

'Perhaps he's discovered a new winter sport?' they surmised.
