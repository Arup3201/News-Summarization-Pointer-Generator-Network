Accused murderer Daniel Jack Kelsall's confession that he was having intrusive thoughts about killing a 'random' was a chilling prophecy and key to the case against him, the crown says.

'The truth is simple. It is awful, but it is simple. This man killed Morgan Huxley for no reason,' Peter McGrath SC said.

Looking directly at the jury, the crown prosecutor on Tuesday detailed point by point the aspects of the case against the 22-year-old, that, he said, would leave them to infer only one thing. 

'This young man Daniel Jack Kelsall in the early hours of September 8, 2013, indecently assaulted Morgan Huxley and then stabbed him to death in his bedroom,' he said.

This comes as the jury retired on Tuesday afternoon to consider its verdict on Kelsall's trial.

'The truth is simple. It is awful, but it is simple. This man killed Morgan Huxley (pictured) for no reason,' Peter McGrath SC said in court on Tuesday

'This young man Daniel Jack Kelsall (pictured) in the early hours of September 8, 2013, indecently assaulted Morgan Huxley and then stabbed him to death in his bedroom,' the crown prosecutor said 

Kelsall, Mr McGrath told the jury, would have them believe that within minutes of striking up a conversation with Mr Huxley - a complete stranger - the 31-year-old had invited him into his Neutral Bay apartment on Sydney's North Shore.

'(Then) this man, a total stranger agreed to the accused's suggestion that he might like to engage in a sexual encounter with him to relieve his stresses.'

Finally, while engaging in this intimate act someone bursts into the bedroom and hits him over the head and assaults Mr Huxley.

Terrified, Kelsall runs away.

'Members of the jury, how plausible was that scenario so far?' Mr McGrath asked.

Urging the jury not to be distracted by 'red herrings', Mr McGrath said the crown case against the former junior chef was straight forward and added up.

It was not Kelsall, he said, that was in the wrong place at the wrong time but Mr Huxley.

'Chillingly he just happens to be someone who has expressed intrusive, recurring and persistent thoughts about killing someone with a knife on the way home from work. A total stranger. Some random.'

This was the 'key' that explained what happened to Mr Huxley that night, Mr McGrath said.

Earlier in the trial, Kelsall, who has pleaded not guilty to stabbing Morgan Huxley to death on September 8, 2013, told the NSW Supreme Court on Monday he was invited to his Neutral Bay apartment on Sydney's North Shore.

Kelsall said that he struck up a conversation with Mr Huxley while walking home in the early hours of the morning. 

He said Mr Huxley was smiling during the friendly chat but became more serious as he started talking about how he had had a 'stressful week'. 

'He said he had some problems with work,' Kelsall said. 'I said something like, 'Do you want to talk about it?'.

'He seemed a little hesitant about it and then he said, 'Yeah, I could do with someone to talk to'.' 

Mr Huxley then invited him to his apartment, Kelsall told the jury.

After talking for a while about Mr Huxley's work, which 'wasn't going so well', Kelsall said he asked the 31-year-old 'Do you want to do things with me?'

The pair then went upstairs to Mr Huxley's room.

'He (Mr Huxley) came in after me and turned off the lights and he immediately dropped his pants.'

With his shoes still on, Kelsall said Mr Huxley lay down on his bed. Kelsall told the court he sat between Mr Huxley's legs and began fondling his penis.

'Then something hit me in the side of the head. It really hurt,' Kelsall said.

Mark Kelsall gave evidence last week at the trial of his son Daniel who is accused of killing Morgan Huxley in 2013 in the victim's Sydney apartment

Paramedics Mark Lenehan and David Rigby, who were the first responders to the home of murder victim Morgan Huxley, were pictured arriving at the NSW Supreme Court last week

'I kind of looked up and there was another person in the room. I got up and ran.

'I knew there was at least one (person there). It could have been more.' 

He told the court he didn't tell police because he was afraid of having anything to do with the murder.

'I want to make amends and tell the truth for a terrible lie I have told and I want them (the jury) to understand my side of the story,' Kelsall said.

Jury deliberations will continue tomorrow.
