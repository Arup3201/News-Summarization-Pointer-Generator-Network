These are the sickening injuries a 91-year-old grandmother suffered after a mugger shoved her to the ground as he snatched her handbag to steal just £20.

Lynne Elmer-Laird smashed her head on a wall and a pavement after refusing to give her handbag to the mugger who attacked her last month.

The keen churchgoer underwent an emergency operation to remove a blood clot from her brain. She also suffered severe bruising and a broken right arm after the attack on August 14.

Horrific: Lynne Elmer-Laird, 91, was battered around the face for just £20 during the mugging last month

Savage: Lynne, who served in the Second World War (right) needed emergency surgery to remove a blood clot after the attack in Highgate, north London, on August 14

Shock: Frail Lynne was found by two friends lying in the street in North London after the attack in broad daylight

She has since been readmitted to hospital following concerns about the head injury.

Police say she had been out shopping in Archway Road the afternoon when she felt a man tugging at her bag in Church Road, Highgate.

Search: Haringey CID released this image of a man they want to speak to in connection with the attack on August 14

She saw a man’s hand inside her bag and tried to pull it away when she was shoved to the floor, hitting her head on the ground.

Her attacker ran off with her purse which contained her bank card, travel pass and just £20 cash.

She suffered severe bruising and swelling to her face, neck, shoulder, leg and a broken arm. She was discharged to hospital but has since been readmitted.

Last night Lynne, who survived the Second World War as an Army nurse in South Pacific, relived the horrific attack.

She told the Daily Mirror: 'He was a big guy, well over six-foot tall, and very strong.

'He shoved me hard and I smacked my head against the pavement. I was in such pain but he just ran off down the road and left me.

'I can't believe something like that could happen in broad daylight. It's awful. I don't know what the Government is doing getting rid of all those police.'

PC Paul Hallas, of Haringey CID said: 
'Whoever did this left an elderly woman on the ground in the street, 
without a care for her welfare.

'Words can’t express the level of depravity the perpetrator stooped to when he targeted this woman.'

Her family have released a statement asking for the public’s help in 
catching the thief, who left fled from the scene with
her purse which had just also contained a travelcard and a bank card.

CCTV pictures
of a man they wish to talk to in relation to the incident have been 
distributed in an attempt to encourage witnesses and anyone else with 
information to come forward.

The statement said: 'Since Lynne was 
mugged she has spent two periods in hospital totalling 10 days which 
included an emergency operation to remove a blood clot from her head.

'Lynne’s family appeal to 
anyone who has information as to the identity of her attacker to contact
police as soon as possible, this man must be caught, his next victim 
might not be so fortunate.'

Another image of a man police wish to speak to over the attack. Police described the attacker as mixed race, 6ft 2in, athletic with dark hair and dark clothes

Lynne remains in hospital in a stable condition following surgery.

The statement continued: 'Lynne has many friends in Highgate and is known and looked after by the local shopkeepers.

'She
was also able to go to Muswell Hill alone by bus and is a member of the
Highgate Literary and Scientific Institution where she attends talks 
and is a keen member of her local church.'
