England will have history behind them and the prospect of making their own when they face Australia on Saturday.

Steve McNamara's men know a victory over the Kangaroos would knock their oldest rivals out of the Four Nations, but if they do win they will be getting the better of Australia for the first time since 2006.

That in itself was a rare victory over the world champions and a repeat in Melbourne would put the current crop of players in esteemed company.

And, for added inspiration, the 17 players selected will wear a specially designed heritage shirt commemorating the jersey worn by the Northern Union side which beat Australia in the 'Rorke's Drift Test' of 1914.

'I think all the lads the are aware of the history rugby league has got. Every time we have the badge on our chest we are playing for a lot of people back at home and people before us,' full-back Sam Tomkins said. 'It's a great way to remember.'

A British side led by Harold Wagstaff won the 1914 clash 14-6, with the game being reduced to 11-a-side owing to a shocking list of injuries. The British players were hailed for their bravery and the game was subsequently named in honour of the British troops that had prevailed at Rorke's Drift in Natal.

But for all the looking back, Tomkins has his eyes fixed forward.

'Australia are a wounded animal (after losing to New Zealand while England beat Samoa) but they have a lot of fight,' the New Zealand Warriors man added.

'They are coming off the back of a loss that will inspire them even more to do their best to beat us. We'll be prepared and it is exciting - it is a chance for a lot of lads to beat Australia on their first tour.

'We want to knock them out - straight out (of the tournament). We're going to Melbourne to win - we're not going to compete for 60 minutes like we have done. We're going and taking the win.'

If they are to do that, then they need to iron out some of the inconsistencies from their 32-26 win over Samoa.

'I'd say we were good in patches, average in patches,' Tomkins said.

'At times we lacked focus in defence, which meant they scored 26 points. It's too many, but we have already reviewed it and we need to improve.

'We fully expected Samoa to come at us for 80 minutes and they did. It's a side littered with good, NRL players. We made it hard.'
