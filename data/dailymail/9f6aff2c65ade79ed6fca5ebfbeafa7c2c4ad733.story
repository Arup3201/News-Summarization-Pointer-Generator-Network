Misleading: Yonas Admasu Kebede, pictured, claimed he was 15 - meaning he would receive free care from the state - when he was actually 20

He claimed the taxpayer should fund his £10,000 flying lessons after his family abandoned him as a child.

Now it appears that Yonas Admasu Kebede may have lied about his age to milk the public purse for tens of thousands of pounds.

The failed asylum seeker pretended to be 15 years old so that he could be cared for as a destitute child – while in reality he was a grown man of almost 20.

He also claimed his mother was missing and his father either dead or in prison, but the Mail’s inquiries reveal that he is still in touch with his family.

They own a three-storey house in one of the wealthiest neighbourhoods of Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, where Mr Kebede grew up.

His lies mean he has wrongly received two years of accommodation, living expenses and schooling paid for by Newcastle City Council.

And because he was a so-called ‘looked-after child’, it has meant the authority has been forced to pay for his flying lessons, even though he turns 26 this month.

The disclosures sparked outrage among politicians, who said the British system was too easy to exploit. Labour MP John Woodcock said: ‘This new  evidence suggests Britain’s compassion has been badly abused.

‘Proving age can be hard and we must never shut the door on any child who genuinely needs help but it should not lead to well-meaning authorities being taken for a ride like this.’

Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, added: ‘This whole case appears to have been a calculated scam to rip off taxpayers. The council weren’t even responsible for this man’s care, so any suggestion that we should still pay for his flying lessons is ludicrous.

‘Given the pious tone taken by Yonas Kebede’s lawyers, and the costs of their legal action, there are serious questions about where the bill for this case should fall. It certainly shouldn’t land on taxpayers’ doorsteps.’

Newcastle City Council was forced to pay £10,000 for Mr Kebede to train as a pilot after it lost a case in the Court of Appeal earlier this year.

It will also pay for his living expenses, likely to total £10,000, while he lives in London for a year. His lawyers won the case by arguing that the council had a duty to pay for ‘education expenses’ after he left school because he had no parents.

In touch: Mr Kebede's parents, Admasu Bedane Kedede and Tayech Getachew, are listed as friends on his Facebook page, though he claims they abandoned him

Mr Kebede claimed in an interview this week that he believed his father, Admasu Kebede Bedane, was in prison or had been killed because he was involved in politics.

He insists that the £10,000 is a loan and he fully intends to pay the money back if and when he qualifies as a pilot.

He said his father had abandoned him and his younger brother Abiy, 20, after their asylum claim was rejected in 2004. He also said his older brother Benyam, now 28, looked after them for three years before leaving them stranded in 2007.

But on Monday, he had the pair listed as ‘friends’ on Facebook, with Benyam stating on his profile that he lives in London.

Mr Kebede’s father has worked as an air traffic controller for  Ethiopian Airlines and lives in a three-bedroom house worth £90,000 in a middle-class suburb of Addis Ababa.

The house, which he shares with his wife Tayech Getachew, was built by Mr Bedane after his application for asylum failed in the UK.

A neighbour said the couple had two vehicles – one an 11 seater  minibus – and they employ a maid.

The locals could not explain how Mr Bedane came into the money to build his home, which was much grander than his old one in a run-down part of town.

A neighbour said: ‘He built the house himself and it only took about eight months. Now it is worth treble the price.’

Instead of sending his three boys to the local government school where education is free, the Orthodox Christian paid about £500 a year to send them to a private school.

Registration documents completed when Yonas Kebede enrolled in nursery at Miskaye Hizunan Medhanealem church school confirm his date of birth as the seventh day of the third month of 1980, which is November 17, 1987 in the UK calendar. His baptism certificate confirmed the details.

His uncle, who lived just around the corner, was a pilot for Ethiopian airlines and three of Yonas’s classmates are also now pilots.

His fellow classmates were the sons and daughters of middle-class parents - the majority of them working as civil servants and others as doctors or engineers.

A school friend, Habte Hundesa, 25, said they had a happy childhood and were privileged to be enrolled in one of the best schools in the country.

When the boys and their father left in 2004 and claimed asylum in the UK, Yonas Kebebe claimed he was aged 13, but in reality he was 16 or 17.

Yonas and Abiy were granted discretionary leave to stay in the UK until November 2014, and there is no guarantee their permission will be extended. They were placed in council care and lived with a foster mother.

They applied for post-18 courses last autumn but found they were not eligible for student loans because of their immigration status.

They then instructed lawyers to make a claim for the money with Newcastle City Council, which paid out £30,000 in legal fees fighting the case.

The council lost, meaning it has to pay £10,000 to each brother in tuition fees and an estimated £10,000 in living expenses every year to fund their post-school education.

The money has been given to them as a loan, to be repaid once they start work.

Abiy Kebede is currently studying for a degree at Manchester Metropolitan University.

Paul Heron, of Public Interest Lawyers, said of Yonas: ‘Our client denies that he has lied about his age.

‘If you publish the allegation in the manner you propose you will be alleging that our client has committed fraud and contempt of court, allegations of the utmost severity that our client unequivocally denies.’

A spokesman for Newcastle City Council said it would look at any evidence produced by the Daily Mail in relation to the case.

That would make him ineligible for free training and living expenses

He also said he lost touch with his family - but has them as Facebook friends

Mr Kebede claimed his father was dead or in prison - in fact he owns a three-storey house in an affluent suburb of Addis Ababa
