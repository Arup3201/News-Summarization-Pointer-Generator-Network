Patricia Arquette has spoken out in support of Bruce Jenner following reports that he is transitioning from male to female.

The Oscar nominated actress, 46, appeared on The Meredith Vieira Show on Wednesday, where she stood up for the former Olympian, and spoke about her transgender sister Alexis.

'I feel like Alexis, my sister, has taught me so much about love and acceptance,' Patricia said. 'It’s a very difficult thing to be transgender, especially 20 years ago when Alexis started ... You have to be so brave to live this truth of who you are.

'If Ms. Jenner is transitioning, I give all my support to her and love and appreciate everything she has given to America and her bravery, because she is fighting a fight for a lot of kids that are being kicked out of their own homes—society turns their back on these kids. It’s really brutal.'

Patricia recalled the conversation she had with her sister Alexis - who is just 15 months younger than her - when she revealed she was transitioning.

'I didn't exactly understand it,' the Boyhood star admitted. 'But our father had died, our mother had died. I’d lost two people I loved.

Not ready to address the reports: Bruce, pictured in October, has not yet confirmed that he is transitioning from male to female

'And we all come into this life in a different package – a baby package. We get older, we become an old person package. If you’re male or female, at the end I didn't care. I had people I loved who died.

'I said, "I don’t care what package you’re comfortable in, I love and accept you. I am glad you are here on earth. I want to be with you, spend time with you." It doesn't matter.'

Patricia went on to slam publications giving Bruce negative press amid reports he has decided to live as a female.

'These newspapers, these magazines, that are being so disrespectful. They should be ashamed,' she said. 'Because they really are on the unforgivable side of history and what they are doing is pathetic and immature and repulsive.'

Patricia added: 'So many young people commit suicide, don’t have acceptance. They’re diminished in society. They’re not allowed to work counters at stores, people make fun of them, snicker at them, attack them.'

Bruce is yet to confirm that he is transitioning from male to female, although it is claimed he will do an exclusive interview with Diane Sawyer, and that he will document the process with a TV series. 

The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star, 65, was involved in a four-car pile-up on Saturday on Pacific Coast Highway, which left one woman dead.

Patricia and Alexis also count actors Rosanna, David and Richmond as their siblings. Alexis' transition was documented in the movie Alexis Arquette: She's My Brother, which premiered in 2007 at the Tribeca Film Festival.

Their father Lewis, who died in 2001, was also an actor, while their mother Mardi, who died in 1997, was an actress, poet, therapist and teacher.
