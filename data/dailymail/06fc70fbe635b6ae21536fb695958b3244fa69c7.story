A headmaster stole more than £53,000 from
his school to fund his gambling addiction.

Andrew Wilkie, principal at Southdown
Primary School in Buckley, north Wales, had already lost his life savings on online
poker sites and had remortgaged his family home.

So he started helping himself to school
funds to further fuel his addiction.

Wilkie, 41, of Buckley, admitted to the theft when the school was
threatened with an emergency audit after an anonymous tip-off, Wrexham Magistrates' Court heard yesterday.

The money was taken by credit transfer
between March 31 and October 19 last year.

Matthew Ellis, prosecuting, said
Flintshire Council had received two anonymous letters urging it to investigate
the misuse of funds at the school.

On October 18, Flintshire's education
department notified the school it was going to carry out an urgent audit of
school funds.

By the end of that day, Mr Ellis said
Wilkie was described as 'clearing his desk'.

He went home and told his wife: 'We're in
financial ruin, I've stolen £53,000 from the school.'

Wilkie then contacted the school governors and
said: 'Come round and see me now, it's urgent.'

Head: Andrew Wilkie was principal at Southdown Primary School in Buckley, north Wales

He told the chairman of governors: 'I've
done something very wrong and it's going to have big implications for the
school.'

Mr Ellis said Wilkie went on to explain he
had a gambling problem and had spent all his family savings on online poker
websites, had had to remortgage his home, and was now using the school's
money.

Wilkie, who was immediately suspended from
his post when the discovery was made, pleaded guilty to stealing a total of
£53,438 from Southdown Primary.

Wrexham Magistrates said their powers were
not sufficient to sentence Wilkie because of the large amount of money
involved.

The case was committed for sentencing to
Chester Crown Court on March 15 and Wilkie was granted unconditional bail.
