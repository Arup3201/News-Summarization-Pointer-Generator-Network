A British retailer believes it may have cracked the recipe to the croissant-doughnut hybrid delicacy that took New York by storm.

Greggs say its take on the cronut - dubbed the Greggsnut - is the most exciting launch at the store since the birth of the sausage roll.

The Greggsnut has been two months in development and goes on sale tomorrow at £1 for a limited time.

Greggs, more famous for its sausage rolls, pasties and iced buns, is certainly taking on the bakery big guns by throwing its hat in the hybrid ring.

Taste
 sensation? Greggs say the Greggsnut - their version of the cronut - is 
the most exciting innovation since the advent of the sausage roll

The bona fide cronut, conceived by and sold exclusively at Dominique Ansel bakery in New York, managed to do what no other baked good has done before. Not even the Krispy Kreme in its heyday could command the sort of hysteria and headlines that the cronut has garnered.

Customers slept outside the small bakery to be first in line outside the shop. Tussles broke out when customers who had been queuing since as early as 4am vyed to get their hands on the dwindling supplies.

Supermodel Heidi Klum gave a box its 
own seat on a private jet so that her family could try them.

The bakery was forced to limit purchases to one box per customer to meet demand, but scalpers 
capitalised by selling them on for $100 each cronut - or $3,000 for ten.

Perfect pastry? The $5 (£3.20) cronut was 
unveiled by New York's Dominique Ansel bakery on May 10 - and almost immediately gained almost mythical status as pastry-lovers fought to get their hands on one

The original cronut is said to be made lovingly using featherlight layers of pastry that are deep-fried, rolled in rose sugar and filled with Tahitian cream.

The Greggsnut, which comes in two flavours, berry or caramel-pecan, is made using a similar method - layers of pastry formed into a doughnut shape, fried, iced, and filled with either berry cream or caramel.

It took Greggs' bakers two months to 
perfect the recipe - which they say (of course they do) is a 'taste 
sensation'.

'We saw how successful the Cronut was in New York and 
challenged ourselves to make a British version,' a spokesman said.

'We believe the Greggsnut could be the most exciting product launch at Greggs since the birth of the sausage roll and are hoping the combination of a Greggs own layered pastry shaped into a doughnut captures the taste buds of London.'

'Hopefully Heidi Klum will order some to be flown over to her from one of our shops!'

THE CRONUT ACCORDING TO DOMINIQUE ANSEL

The cronut, which has already received 
interest from curious pastry chefs in Hong Kong, Melbourne, and Los 
Angeles, is made from thin layers of flaky croissant dough that are deep
 fried, rolled in rose sugar, and then filled with light Tahitian 
vanilla cream.

Rose-flavored glaze thinly coats the top layer, 
which peels apart like those in a mille crepe cake; finally, 
crystallized rose petals add a garnish flourish.

'A cronut is not
 as simple as frying up some croissant dough,' said the chef. 'We 
actually make a special laminated dough that is sheeted and folded 
different than a croissant'.

Ansel has expressed concern that scalpers are said that his cronuts

Man behind the invention: 'I'm a big fan of 
quality over quantity... It takes a lot to ensure all our other pastries
 are up to par with standards as well,' said Mr Ansel

AND ACCORDING TO GREGGS:

'It took master bakers at the UK’s leading bakery retailer two months to perfect the recipe which Paul Birchall, Head of Product Research and Development, says is a taste sensation.

The Greggsnut, which will be available for £1 in selected shops in London from tomorrow (6 September) until 1 October, is a combination of Greggs' own layered pastry formed into the shape of a doughnut and is available in two flavours, summer berry & crème and caramel and pecan.

'We saw how successful the Cronut was in New York and challenged ourselves to make a British version,' they said.
