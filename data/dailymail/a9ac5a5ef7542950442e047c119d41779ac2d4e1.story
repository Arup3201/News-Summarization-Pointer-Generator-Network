The family of a 
Hofstra University student shot dead by a police officer while she was 
being held hostage last year has filed a wrongful death suit.

Newsday reports the family of Hofstra junior Andrea Rebello contends the 
officer "recklessly and unnecessarily endangered" her life while she was
 being held by an armed man inside her off-campus house.

The
 newspaper reported Friday the Tarrytown family is seeing unspecified 
damages from Nassau County and the Nassau County Police Department.

Both
 declined comment.

The county prosecutor ruled
 last month that officer Nikolas Budimlic had no option but deadly 
force.

District Attorney Kathleen Rice concluded the 21-year-old 
Rebello's death was caused by a gunman breaking into her Hempstead 
residence with a gun, taking several residents hostage and refusing to 
surrender to police.

Officer Nikolas Budimlic ‘acted 
accordingly’ when he opened fire, killing not only the armed suspect but
 21-year-old Andrea Rebello in May 2013, at an off-campus New York 
house, the Nassau County District Attorney's Office announced on 
Wednesday following an 11-month investigation.

Budimlic ‘reasonably perceived threats of deadly force against himself and others and acted accordingly,’ the report states.

The suspect, Delton Smith, 30, who 
was a wanted felon after breaking parole for an armed robbery, was shot 
seven times by the responding officer.

‘Though
 the results were unquestionably tragic, criminal charges under these 
circumstances would be inappropriate and legally unsustainable,’ Nassau 
County District Attorney Kathleen Rice said at the conclusion of a 
28-page report into the May 2013 shooting.

Rice's report for the first time 
publicly identified the police officer involved in the shooting as 
Nikolas Budimlic, an eight-year veteran of the Nassau Police Department 
who had previously spent 12 years as a New York City police officer.

Budimlic was among the first officers to respond to a report of an early morning robbery at a house near the Hofstra campus.

After
 entering the house, the officer soon encountered Smith holding Rebello 
in a headlock.

Smith maneuvered down a flight of stairs and was 
attempting to leave with the young woman through a rear door, hollering 
expletives at police officers and threatening to shoot the student.

‘Smith
 ignored numerous commands to drop his weapon and repeated his threats 
to shoot both Andrea Rebello and Officer Budimlic,’ the report states.

The county prosecutor ruled last month that officer Nikolas Budimlic had no option but deadly force in response to the home invasion

‘Officer
 Budimlic clearly and reasonably believed that the use of deadly 
physical force was necessary to defend himself and Andrea Rebello and, 
on this basis, made the decision to discharge his weapon.’

Rice's report noted that Smith, 30, had been on parole for his involvement in an armed robbery.

An arrest warrant had been issued for him about three weeks before the fatal shooting occurred.

Smith also had prior convictions for attempted robbery and weapons possession.

It
 was not clear whether the weapon he was carrying the night of the 
Hofstra robbery was operable, the report found. Investigators suggested 
it may have been damaged after Smith was shot and fell on the weapon.

James
 Carver, president of the officer's police union, said he was not 
surprised by the prosecutor's conclusions.
