It's behind you

Hard to know if Sir Nick Faldo is more horrified by his tee shot on the fifth or the giant octopus behind him (below).

Shot of the day

Matteo Manassero was forced to splash out of a fairway bunker on the first hole but holed his third shot from 150 yards for a stunning birdie.

Finest performance

Tiger Woods's mesmeric return to major championship golf was all the more staggering for his previously unthinkable smiles at the crowd.

Best dressed

Any one of the many kids in the crowd copying Rickie Fowler's trademark bright orange cap and shirt â€“ golf has a bright future.

Boost: Tiger Woods made an impressive return to action with a three-under-par 69

Nicest Tweet

Ben Crane, who flew over from America yesterday hoping he would play as first alternate: 'I didn't get in but don't regret the trip. This is a special tournament.'

What a joke

Woods,
 when asked by an American journalist if it felt like the 'good old 
times' were back, replied: 'It wasn't that long ago. I did win five 
times last year'.

Picture of the day

Rickie Fowler was clearly bored with walking the course during his brilliant round of 68 so decidedto leap over parts of it (below).

Top strop 1

Henrik Stenson snapped a wedge over his knee after taking two shots to get out of the rough on the 17th. 'It will need a bit of love,' he joked.

Top strop 2

Bubba Watson dropped five shots around the turn and moaned: 'There are a thousand people in the fairway. I just want to play golf.'

Incredulous laugh

Jim Furyk couldn't help himself after watching 64-year-old Tom Watson, smoke a three wood down the fifth.
