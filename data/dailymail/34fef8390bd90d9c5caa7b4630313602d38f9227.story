The late Steve Jobs can't present at Apple events anymore for obvious reasons - but will attendees at this year's Macworld conference settle for Ashton Kutcher?

The actor, who plays the former Apple boss in the upcoming biopic jOBS, will open the annual San Francisco conference with a panel discussion on the film.

Joining Kutcher at the conference at the city's Moscone Center, will be actor Josh Gad, who also appears in 
the film as Apple co-founder Steve Wosniak.

The Steves: Kutcher and Gad will star as Steve Jobs and Steve Wosniak in the upcoming film, which is slated for an April release

Gad currently stars as the black sheep of the first family on the NBC sitcom 1600 Penn.

Gad told US Weekly last year that Kutcher's transformation into Jobs will 'blow a lot of people away.'

This year's Macworld/iWorld conference will be held from January 31 to February 2.

The conference will also include appearances by musician Will.I.Am, Saturday Night Live veteran Fred Armisen and Intel 'futurist' Brian David Johnson.

The film is due out in April.

In the past, Apple has used the Macworld conference as a vehicle to push its new products. The very first iPhone was presented there in 2007.

Copy and Paste: Ashton Kutcher's eerily accurate transformation into 
late Apple founder Steve Jobs is shown as the first official picture of 
biopic 'jOBS' is released

In character: An insight into the way Ashton would look in the role was given as he was spotted filming scenes earlier this year

But the tech giant has not participated in the event since 2009, when Jobs' health first began to decline.

For the last several months, Kutcher, 
34, has been seen posing with his dated hair style and beard during his 
transformation into Jobs.

Kutcher drew significant buzz late last 
year, when pictures of him in character emerged that showed a striking 
resemblance to Jobs, who died in October 2011.

In one, Kutcher seated on a desk and carrying his old-fashioned reading glasses.

An incredible attention to detail is evident in the items surrounding Kutcher, including dated computers sitting in the background.

jOBS tells the story of the Apple co-founder's pioneering life.

Uncanny: Kutcher threw himself into the role and even his co-stars were left astounded by the similarities

Last year, he was spotted filming the biopic at Loyola Marymount University in LA.

Kutcher looked a million miles away from his normal appearance as 
he recreated the movements and image of the late Steve Jobs.

Everything from the side parting hairstyle to the tight lipped mouth mirrored the way Jobs looked.

Kutcher
was seen on set clasping his hands together just like Jobs always did, 
and he appeared to have even copied the way he walked with his shoulders
slightly slouched.

The former model was dressed in Steve's trademark running trainers with jeans, a white shirt and a black sleeveless cardigan.

And
even his co-star Josh Gad, who plays Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak in 
the project, has been astounded by his transformation.

He told UsWeekly: 'Ashton is going to blow a lot of people away. His performance was absolutely transformational.

'If he looked any more like Steve Jobs, I think it would just confuse a lot of people... It's that uncanny.'
