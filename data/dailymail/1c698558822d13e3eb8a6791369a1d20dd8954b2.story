Washed up: A decomposed whale head was found at Perth's Sorrento Beach on Monday morning

Parks and Wildlife Senior Marine Ranger Vaughn Chapple said in a statement to the DPAW heavy machinery had been used to remove the head, which weighed around five tonnes and was in an area that was difficult to access.

'It was a complex and challenging operation due to the location as the whale head had to be moved by excavator up a 15m long 40 degree embankment,' he said.

'Overall since the removal operation began this morning, it has taken five hours to remove the whale head, which is generally a third of the size of the entire whale’s body.'

Senior marine operations officer John Edwards told DPAW on Monday 'when the whale carcass is removed, it will be disposed of at an approved refuse site.'

The remains were found about 800m north of the Marmion Angling and Aquatic Club, and forced authorities to close the area on Monday amid fears the carcass could attract sharks.
