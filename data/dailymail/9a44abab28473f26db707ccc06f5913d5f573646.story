A military fiancée who proudly boasts an 'I Love My Soldier' bumper sticker was shocked to find a spiteful letter slapped on her windshield that attacked her and threatened violence for supporting the army.

Savannah student, Ellen Wilson, 23, was in a Target parking lot earlier this month when she found the anonymous note that labeled her a 'b***h' and implied that her future husband, Chase Nye, was guilty of committing 'unnecessary murders'.

The venomous letter personally attacked Wilson's fiancee for not being the hero she believes him to be and then frightened her when it finished up by calling her lucky, because 'I didn't slash your damn tires!'.

Shocked: Ellen Wilson returned to her car to find a vindictive note attacking her fiancee's service in the US Military

Gross: This is the letter than Wilson discovered on the windshield of her car earlier this month that so disturbed her

Quickly driving away in case someone was watching her, Wilson returned home and posted the hate-filled letter to Facebook, drawing an instant and stunned response.

'I got in my car and noticed the paper on the windshield,' Wilson told WTVM-TV.

'I drove off in case someone was watching, and then I grabbed it and read it and saw this lovely letter from this person.'

The vitriolic letter must have been written and posted onto her car in the short time she was inside Target on an errand.

'So I noticed your ‘I love my soldier’ decal,' it reads.

'I’m sure he is your ‘hero’ too right? I feel bad for you and how blind your must be to what is really going on in this country. First off he is not a hero. Your ‘man’ is a pawn being used in the immoral game of wholesale murder.'

Happy couple: Chase Nye and his fiance, Ellen Wilson (together, right) are upset at the response to her proud bumper sticker

Frightened: As soon as the contents of the letter dawned on Wilson, she drove away quickly in case she was being watched

Controversial? This is the bumper sticker on the back of Ellen Wilson's car

The letter closed with this: 'There is nothing heroic about blindly following immoral orders for an undeserved paycheck, especially when such orders involve the unnecessary murder of others!!!

'It’s people like you and your ‘soldier’ who are destructing our country, shame on you b****! You’re lucky I didn’t slash your damn tires!!'

Wilson told WTVM that she was stunned someone would author such a letter.

'How could someone do this?” she said. “I’m not mad. It’s fine what you believe in and what I believe in, but I’m not going to hate you for it. But to attack somebody else, especially someone close to me, is a different story.

'This is real, and it happened, and I just don’t want it to affect another military spouse,' she added.

Indeed, Wilson's fiancée has now asked her to remove the I Love My Soldier bumper sticker because he doesn't want her to become the subject of anymore abuse.

The Savannah, Georgia, American Legion and Veteran's Council member, Marine Jimmy Ray said he was disturbed by the whole episode.

'If they are so concerned, why didn’t they sign it?'

'So I noticed your ‘I love my soldier’ decal. I’m sure he is your [sic] ‘hero’ too right? I feel really bad for you and how blind you must be to what is really going on in this country. First off he is NOT your hero. Your ‘man’ is a pawn being used in the immoral game of wholesale murder. If you’re aware of the real reasons America goes to war (corporate profits) and the role ‘soldiers’ play in making such immoral acts possible. The last thing you would label a soldier is a hero.

There is nothing heroic about blindly following immoral orders from a undeserved paycheck, especially when such orders involve the unnecessary murder of others!!! It’s people like you and your ‘soldier’ who are destructing our country, shame on you b****! You’re lucky I didn’t slash your damn tires!'
