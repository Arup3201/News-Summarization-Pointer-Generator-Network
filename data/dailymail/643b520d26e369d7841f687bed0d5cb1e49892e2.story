The first public housing property, with sweeping views of Sydney Harbour, was auctioned off for $1.9 million tonight - $600,000 more than the terrace was predicted to be sold for.

The heritage-listed home at 119 Kent Street is the first of 293 state-owned houses to go under the hammer in Millers Point and Dawes Point in Sydney's CBD.

The auction was held in a secret location on Thursday night with authorities imposing strict rules on who can attend to keep potential protestors at bay over the controversial sale.

More than 600 public housing tenants will be relocated as part of the selling - off process.

The last public housing tenant paid $77.20 per week at the Kent Street terrace.

It's the first public housing property with a multimillion dollar view of Sydney harbour to be auctioned off in a secret location on Thursday night

The rundown four bedroom property has been vacant since February 2011. More than 600 tenants have been relocated to sell off the Sydney terraces

McGrath Estate Agents said conditions of entry was a total ban of any video, photography or audio and any person who causes a disturbance will be removed. 

Only pre-registered buyers were allowed entry with only two people per group permitted.

The 1880s Victorian Italianate terrace is set over four levels and contains the original fireplaces and floorboards.

The last public housing tenant at the Kent Street property paid $77.20 per week, but it now has a price guide of more than $1.3 million

Only vetted buyers who are in a position to buy will be allowed entry into the secret auction to try and ward of protests over the controversial public housing sell-off

For every property sold off in Millers Point, the government expects to be able to build an additional three houses in other Sydney suburbs.

That's the basis of the government's justification for controversially evicting hundreds of public housing tenants.

To restore and maintain the properties would cost as much as $100 million and the average maintenance bill of each house averages about $14,500 a year. This is compared with $3,000 to $3,500 across the rest of NSW, according to the government.

The Kent Street property going to auction on Thursday night is one of six heritage-listed public housing properties with this multimillion dollar view to go under the hammer in Millers point and Dawes Point

Six million dollar properties have been listed for sale - they are priced at about $1.8 million each

11 Lower Street at Dawes Point is also set to go under the hammer as part of the controversial government sell off

Family and Community Services Minister Gabrielle Upton said it wasn’t fair to the 58,000 applicants on the public social housing waiting list for the government to spend hundreds of millions of dollars maintaining unsuitable properties for social housing.

‘While we are very conscious that this involves relocating tenants who live in these properties, a tough decision had to be taken that will benefit far more people in need of housing assistance,’ she said.

Finance and Services minister Dominic Perrottet, said the process of relocating tenants was being done with 'sensitivity and compassion' and a Tenant Relocation Team was 'going to great lengths to satisfy their specific requests'.
