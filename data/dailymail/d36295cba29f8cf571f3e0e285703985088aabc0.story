Alex Salmond today toasted a 'very encouraging' opinion poll which shows the gap between the Yes and No campaigns in the vote over Scottish independence has narrowed to just six points.

Support for the Yes vote has surged following the First Minister's triumph in last week’s TV debate against former Chancellor Alistair Darling, leader of the Better Together campaign.

The YouGov survey for The Times and The Sun showed 48 per cent plan to vote No, 42 per cent back the Yes campaign and 10 per cent remain undecided.

First Minister Alex Salmond, on a visit to the Eden Brewery in Guardbridge, near St Andrews in Fife, said the latest polls were 'very encouraging'

Mr Salmond has been boosted by his victory in last week's TV debate against Better Together leader Alistair Darling

Excluding 
Don’t Knows, No is on 53 percentage points compared to 47 percentage 
points for Yes. Three weeks ago, the split was 61 points for No and 39 
for Yes.

According to YouGov, undecided voters are twice as likely to vote for independence.

The
 surge will add to concerns that the momentum may be with the 
independence campaign as the referendum approaches on 18 September.

Speaking during a visit to Eden Brewery, just outside St Andrews, Fife, Mr Salmond said: 'I have always thought we would win. The polls are obviously very encouraging.

'But I am much more encouraged by the reaction on the streets. Dundee yesterday was extraordinary - it was a carnival atmosphere with certainly hundreds of people in the city centre.

The Proclaimers have given a £10,000 donation to the Yes campaign, it emerged today. 

Twins Craig and Charlie Reid (above), who are well-known for hits
such as Letter To America and I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles), gifted £10,000 to Yes
Scotland, new figures revealed.

They said that as 'lifelong supporters of Scottish
independence' the cash gift was a 'matter of principle' for
them.

They spoke after the Electoral Commission published its
latest figures on campaign donations ahead of the referendum on September 18.

Yes Scotland raised £168,000 in donations between July
25 and August 21 this year, with a further £10,000 being given to the
pro-independence Business for Scotland group.

Designer Vivienne Westwood (right) claimed that an independent Scotland could be 'a model to us all'.

The famed designer was inducted into the awards’ Hall Of Fame of the Scottish Fashion Awards for her contribution to the industry. Accepting the honour, Westwood, 73, said an independent Scotland could be 'a model to us all ... if it could become a people-friendly society'.

'People were queuing to register to vote. Yes, the polls are encouraging, but it is happening on the ground and in the streets and in communities.'

Mr Salmond said Labour voters were moving to Yes because they do not like seeing their leaders 'in bed with the Tories', due to the Yes campaign's argument that the NHS will be better protected with independence and because of the 'positivity of the Yes campaign'.

The Times reported that YouGov also found that some voters have changed sides.

The
 pro-independence vote among Labour supporters has risen from 18 
percentage points to 30 percentage points in a month. While the 
proportion of Liberal Democrat voters supporting independence has also 
increased – doubling to 24 points.

SNP
 ministers have been working hard to attract the centre-left vote – with
 promises of more public spending in an independent Scotland.

The proportion of women voting for independence has also increased, from 37 percentage points a month ago to 42 points.

The
 latest YouGov poll comes days after a Survation survey for the Daily 
Mail found exactly the same result.

It said the No campaign’s lead had 
shrunk to six points, with 53 percentage points among decided voters 
compared to 47 points for Yes.

Last night 
the president of YouGov, Peter Kellner, said: ‘Game on. YouGov’s latest 
poll puts Alex Salmond within touching distance of victory.

‘Until
 one month ago, the No campaign held a steady lead of at least 16 
points. When I first saw the results, I wanted to make sure this 
movement was real. It is.’

Last
 night Gordon Brown urged the Scots to reject independence if they want 
to avoid massive NHS cuts. The former Prime Minister unveiled figures 
which show that the Union lavishes far more on the healthcare of the 
Scottish than it does on the English.

He revealed that £176 a month was spent by the NHS per head of Scottish population – £17 more than the £159 per head in England.

This
 £1billion ‘NHS dividend’, Mr Brown said, would be under threat if the 
Scots voted for independence, because the rest of the UK would no longer
 be bearing the burden of the costs.

The latest YouGov poll shows a sharp narrowing in the lead for the No campaign ahead of the independence referendum on September 18

The Yes campaign is now just six points behind in the battle for independence, suggesting Alex Salmond has the momentum

Mr Brown 
also warned that a breakaway Scotland would be an ‘international 
outcast’ if Mr Salmond reneged on its share of the UK’s debt.

He
 unveiled his figures on healthcare spending in the first of a series of
 rallies designed to target half a million undecided voters. He said the
 Union delivered a million jobs, higher pensions, a lower cost of 
living, a stable currency – and an ‘NHS dividend’ worth £1billion a 
year.

He
 said: ‘With more elderly people, more people with disabilities and a 
wider geographical area to cover, Scottish needs are, rightly, greater 
and the share out of resources arises from a principle which is the 
fairest there could be: you pay in across the UK based on your ability 
to pay and you benefit based on your need.’

Better Together leader Alistair Darling yesterday launched a new ad van campaign with Leanne Williams and baby Charlotte near the Beacon Arts Centre in Greenock in Scotland

Gordon Brown said £176 a month was spent on healthcare per head of Scottish population – £17 more than the £159 people in England get

In his speech, Mr Brown highlighted academic research showing 962,000 Scottish jobs – more than 40 per cent – are linked directly or indirectly to the UK.

The Better Together campaign unveiled controversial billboards with slogans such as: ‘I love my family. I’m saying No Thanks.’ Mr Darling said: ‘This poll is not a test of our Scottishness – it is a test of common sense.’
