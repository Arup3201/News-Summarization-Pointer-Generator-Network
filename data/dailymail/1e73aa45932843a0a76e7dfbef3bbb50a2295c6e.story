A British charity worker rescued in a dramatic SAS raid in Afghanistan was hours from being executed.

David Cameron ordered crack soldiers to storm remote caves where Helen Johnston was being held after receiving intelligence the kidnappers planned to sell her to the Taliban.

All four captors guarding Miss Johnston, 28, were killed in seconds during the ‘surgical’ strike by 28 Special Forces troops.

Safe and sound: Rescued British hostage Helen Johnston arrives in Kabul following her kidnap ordeal

Military chiefs pinpointed the location – a place known as the  Valley of the Ants – after a US Predator drone ‘locked on’ to electronic signals from one of the hostages’ mobile phones.

The Prime Minister authorised the raid amid fears the gang were preparing to kill Miss Johnston and her three female colleagues or hand them over to hardline insurgents.

A defence source said: ‘She was in 
immediate danger. One option they were looking at was flogging the 
hostages on to the Taliban so we couldn’t wait a second longer.

‘If
she had been passed to a more ideologically-motivated group, her life 
would have been in even more serious danger. The prospect did not bear 
thinking about.

Brave: Helen Johnston was freed on Friday after being kidnapped on May 22 in Badakhshan province

‘Thankfully, everything fell into place for the operation – it was a textbook mission.’

Last night, Miss Johnston was safe and well in the Afghan capital Kabul. In a remarkable show of fortitude, the nutritionist – who has spoken to her family in Britain – is considering continuing her aid work in Afghanistan.

Mr Cameron called Miss Johnston, from Stoke Newington in East London, after she arrived at the British Embassy.

The Prime Minister hailed the  soldiers who took part in the ‘extraordinarily brave, breath-taking operation’. In a warning to terrorists, he added: ‘If they take British citizens as hostage, they can expect a swift and brutal end.’

Following the rescue in the early hours of Saturday, Miss Johnston’s family said in a statement: ‘We are delighted and hugely relieved by the wonderful news that Helen and all her colleagues have been freed.

‘We are deeply grateful to everyone involved in her rescue.’

The ordeal began on May 22 when Miss Johnston, Kenyan medic Moragwe Oirere, 26, and two Afghan women were snatched at gunpoint as they travelled on horseback in Badakhshan, a lawless province in north-east Afghanistan.

The women, employed by Swiss non-governmental organisation Medair, were visiting flood victims.

Rescue: The dramatic raid took place at 2am in Shahr-e-Bozorgd district, in a large forested area near the Tajikistan border called Koh-e-Laran

The bandits, a criminal gang in contact with Taliban fighters, demanded a £7million ransom and the release from jail of a colleague held for murder and drugs.

They threatened to kill the hostages, prompting the Government’s emergency committee Cobra, which met each day during the crisis, to draw up rescue plans.

But the breakthrough came when military chiefs got an ‘electronic lock’ on to signals from one of the hostages’ mobile phones before its battery lost power.

This meant they could pinpoint the exact location of the captives to a cave network inside the Koh-e-Laram forest,  close to the border with Tajikistan.

Special Forces ‘eyes on the ground’ were monitoring the gang’s movements, although it is not clear if the troops were British or American.

Relieved: David Cameron gave the go-ahead for this morning's rescue of Helen Johnson, who had been working for a Swiss-based aid organisation

Kidnappers' lair: Aid worker Helen Johnston was held in a cave-dwelling complex

Fears for the women’s safety heightened on Wednesday when a member of the Taliban was overheard in an intercepted mobile phone conversation urging the kidnappers to put on a ‘show of intent’.

This was interpreted by military chiefs that at least one hostage could be executed on video to increase pressure on negotiators.

The SAS mission was given the go-ahead by the Prime Minister at an emergency meeting in London at 3pm on Friday.

Heroic: The SAS were helicoptered to the cave where the hostages were being held and stormed it, killing the kidnappers and releasing all four captives alive

Wearing night-vision goggles, the troops watched the caves until two kidnappers emerged. They were shot dead with silenced weapons, and the soldiers entered the cave and shot the two remaining guards.

None of the soldiers was injured.

The hostages, all unharmed, were airlifted to safety in RAF helicopters. A simultaneous raid by US troops on a cave network nearby left another seven gang members dead.

A military source said: ‘This was a classic operation. All the bases were covered and it was executed brilliantly. The strike was made with surgical precision.’
