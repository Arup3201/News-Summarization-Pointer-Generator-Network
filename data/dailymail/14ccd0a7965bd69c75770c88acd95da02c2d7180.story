Crystal Palace midfielder Adlene Guedioura is joining Watford on loan until January. 

The 29-year-old has been on the periphery of Neil Warnock's squad this season and has enjoyed successful spells in the Championship previously with Nottingham Forest.

Guedioura's last match for the Eagles came against West Brom back in October.

He has since been overlooked as captain Mile Jedinak, Welsh international Joe Ledley and summer recruit James McArthur are all above the Algerian in Palace's midfield pecking order.

Meanwhile, Leeds United striker Nicky Ajose, 23, is joining Crewe on loan. 

The League One side are also taking 19-year-old Uche Ikpeazu on loan from Watford.
