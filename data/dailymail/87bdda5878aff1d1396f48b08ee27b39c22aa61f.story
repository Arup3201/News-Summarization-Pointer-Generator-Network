Roger Federer halted Novak Djokovic's 28-match unbeaten run in China as the Swiss defeated the world number one to book his place in the final of the Shanghai Masters.

Federer, who was seeded third in the tournament, defeated his Serbian rival 6-4, 6-4 in a match time of one hour and 35 minutes to line up a meeting with Gilles Simon in Sunday's final.

Federer is already in line to return to number two in the ATP rankings and if he beats Simon that feat will be made even sweeter, as a win would mark his first title in Shanghai.
