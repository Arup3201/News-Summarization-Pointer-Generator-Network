When a man tragically died shoveling snow from his roof, the first responders who arrived just too late to save his life decided to finish the job in his memory.

Miroslaw Dabrowski was removing the build up of snow above his New England home when the 57-year-old suffered a heart-attack, the New York Daily News reported.

A relative he invited over to assist him called 911 when he arrived, but the Manchester Fire Rescue EMS and the city's police department did not reach him fast enough.

Kindness: Miroslaw Dabrowski died shoveling snow from his roof so the emergency responders (picture) who arrived too late to save his life finished the job in his memory

Good deed: The first responders (pictured) finished the job for Mr Dabrowski - who had a heart attack on his roof - so the family would not be worried about their home's structural integrity

Fire Chief David Billings told Daily News: 'Quite often a situation like this leaves first responders frustrated and feeling somewhat helpless. They felt going back and finishing the job would at least have a positive outcome for the family.

'They just wanted to do something for the family so when they got home they wouldn't have to worry about the integrity of the house.'

The emergency services used a ladder to reach the collapsed man on the roof but failed to revive him, Billings added.

The father of three was brought back down and taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead.

A few hours after being contacted, a dozen members of the rescue service and police department returned to his home and finish Mr Dabrowski's shoveling duties in his memory.

And Dabrowski's wife Teresa told the Hartford Courant the family was touched by their efforts, saying: 'He would be very appreciative that someone was looking out for his family. We are all grateful to them.'

Even though it deviates from their usual job description, Billings said the responders like doing something to comfort a bereaved family during such terrible moments.

He said: 'I certainly support them doing that. I was proud of their actions.'
