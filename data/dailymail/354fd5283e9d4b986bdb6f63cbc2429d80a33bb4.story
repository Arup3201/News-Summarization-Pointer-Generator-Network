Winston Churchill hailed the D-Day landings as the ‘most complicated and difficult’ operation ever launched, even as troops were still battling up the Normandy beaches.

With the invasion still underway, the Prime Minister updated MPs on the ambitious battle plan ‘to furnish the enemy with a succession of surprises’.

MPs applauded after Mr Churchill revealed how military commanders had reported ‘that everything is proceeding according to plan…and what a plan!’

Exact details of the operation could not be made public, to prevent Nazi Germany from learning of the movement of the Allied Forces.

But Mr Churchill revealed how an ‘immense armada’ of more than 4,000 ships and several thousand smaller craft had launched the ‘liberating assault’ on the northern coast of France.

‘This vast operation is undoubtedly the most complicated and difficult that has ever occurred’, he said.

‘The battle that has now begun will grow constantly in scale and in intensity for many weeks to come and I shall not attempt to speculate upon its course.’

D-Day on June 6, 1944 was the 
beginning of an 80-day campaign to liberate the region which involved 
three million troops and cost the lives of 250,000.

Mr
 Churchill’s statement also included news of the liberation of Rome: ‘A 
memorable and glorious event, which rewards the intense fighting of the 
last five months in Italy.’

But
 the focus was on the events which were still unfolding in France, as 
thousands of troops made their way across the Channel by sea and by air.

‘It involves tides, wind, 
waves, visibility, both from the air and the sea standpoint, and the 
combined employment of land, air and sea forces in the highest degree of
 intimacy and in contact with conditions which could not and cannot be 
fully foreseen,’ Mr Churchill said.

‘There
 are already hopes that actual tactical surprise has been attained, and 
we hope to furnish the enemy with a succession of surprises during the 
course of the fighting.’

At 
the time the wartime coalition government reported that obstacles and 
mines in the sea had not proved as deadly as anticipated.

Churchill said an 'immense armada' of thousands of ships was supporting the Allied forces

The British, American, French and Canadian troops who parachuted into enemy lines had successfully ‘quelled’ enemy fire.

Mr Churchill said: ‘The Anglo-American Allies are sustained by about 11,000 first line aircraft, which can be drawn upon as may be needed for the purposes of the battle.’

To applause from MPs, he concluded: ‘Nothing that equipment,  science or forethought could do has been neglected, and the whole process of opening this great new front will be pursued with the utmost resolution both by the commanders and by the United States and British Governments whom they serve.’

In response Arthur Greenwood, the 
leader of the opposition during the Second World War, said the outbreak 
of applause was a sign of ‘gratitude to all those who have bled and 
fought in the battles in Italy’.

He
 added: ‘Now that our Armies there are on the march, it will not be long
 before the German invader is turned out of that peninsula. We are 
living through momentous hours.’

Mr
 Greenwood went on: ‘There is nothing much that we can do, except to 
pledge ourselves, and to pledge our physical and spiritual resources, to
 the unstinted aid of the men and women who are serving overseas; to let
 them know the pride that we shall feel in their victories and the 
sadness that we shall feel about their losses.’

Communist MP William Gallacher said: ‘This is one of the most solemn moments in the life of this Parliament, and it is certainly not a time for making, or trying to make, speeches, but I should like to express my own feeling.

‘And I am sure the feeling of every Member of the House, that our hearts and our thoughts are with these lads who have gone across to the Continent and with their mothers here at home.’

Labour MP Aneurin Bevan urged Mr 
Churchill to send a message ‘to the people of France at this moment… 
directly from the representatives of the British people to the people of
 France’.

Mr Churchill 
pledged to keep MPs updated on the progress of the landings, and 
returned to deliver a second statement that evening.

Having
 spent the day listening to the latest communications from the front, he
 revealed the operation was ‘proceeding in thoroughly satisfactory 
manner’.

He claimed that ‘many dangers and difficulties which at this time last night appeared extremely formidable are behind us’.

He suggested that the Channel 
crossing had been completed ‘with far less loss than we apprehended’ and
 the RAF had been successful in weakening the German batteries.

He
 went on: ‘The landings along the whole front have been effective, and 
our troops have penetrated, in some cases, several miles inland. 
Lodgments exist on a broad front.’

Opposition leader Arthur Greenwood said Britain was 'living through momentous hours' while Labour MP Aneurin Bevan urged Mr Churchill to send a message of solidarity to the people of France

The ‘outstanding feature’ had been the troops parachuted into German lines ‘on a scale far larger than anything that has been seen so far in the world’.

Despite fears about the weather, and concerns that visibility would be poor, ‘these landings took place with extremely little loss and with great accuracy’ he said.

As details emerged of progress being made along the beaches and into key towns, Mr Churchill said several bridges had been captured.

But he warned: ‘All this, although a very valuable first step - a vital and essential first step - gives no indication of what may be the course of the battle in the next days and weeks, because the enemy will now probably endeavour to concentrate on this area.

‘In that event heavy fighting will soon begin and will continue without end, as we can push troops in and he can bring other troops up. It is, therefore, a most serious time that we enter upon.

‘Thank God, we enter upon it with our great Allies all in good heart and all in good friendship.’

Dwight D. Eisenhower and Winston Churchill visiting troops in Normandy

I have to announce to the House that during the night and the early hours of this morning the first of the series of landings in force upon the European Continent has taken place. 

In this case the liberating assault fell upon the coast of France. An immense armada of upwards of 4,000 ships, together with several thousand smaller craft, crossed the Channel.

Massed airborne landings have been successfully effected behind the enemy lines and landings on the beaches are proceeding at various points at the present time.

The fire of the shore batteries has been largely quelled. The obstacles that were constructed in the sea have not proved so difficult as was apprehended.

The Anglo-American Allies are sustained by about 11,000 first line aircraft, which can be drawn upon as may be needed for the purposes of the battle.

I cannot, of course, commit myself to any particular details. Reports are coming in in rapid succession.

So far the Commanders who are engaged report that everything is proceeding according to plan. And what a plan!

This vast operation is undoubtedly the most complicated and difficult that has ever occurred.

It involves tides, wind, waves, visibility, both from the air and the sea standpoint, and the combined employment of land, air and sea forces in the highest degree of intimacy and in contact with conditions which could not and cannot be fully foreseen.

There are already hopes that actual tactical surprise has been attained, and we hope to furnish the enemy with a succession of surprises during the course of the fighting.

The battle that has now begun will grow constantly in scale and in intensity for many weeks to come and I shall not attempt to speculate upon its course.

This I may say, however. Complete unity prevails throughout the Allied Armies. There is a brotherhood in arms between us and our friends of the United States. 

There is complete confidence in the supreme commander, General Eisenhower, and his lieutenants, and also in the commander of the Expeditionary Force, General Montgomery.

The ardour and spirit of the troops, as I saw myself, embarking in these last few days was splendid to witness.

Nothing that equipment,  science or forethought could do has been neglected, and the whole process of opening this great new front will be pursued with the utmost resolution both by the commanders and by the United States and British Governments whom they serve.
