The grandfather of Ben Needham, who went missing 21 years ago on a Greek holiday island, joined a major search operation today.

Eddie Needham has arrived at Kos to meet Greek and British police officers to trawl through land close to the farmhouse on the Greek island where Ben went missing in 1991.

As he joined a 50-strong team of experts excavating a mound of earth he said he was overwhelmed by the support he had received.

Mr Needham (centre) said although he found it difficult to return to Kos, he was 'pleased' he had to help in the search

Ben, from Sheffield, vanished after he
travelled to the island with his mother and grandparents, Eddie and 
Christine, who were renovating the building in the village of Iraklise.

Local people have joined the operation, and Mr Needham said although he found it difficult to return to Kos, he was 'pleased' he had.

In a statement issued by South Yorkshire Police, he said: 'I would like to thank the Greek authorities for their investigation and South Yorkshire Police for their support.

'I also can't believe the support we're getting from the local community.

'Can I please thank the local teachers, council workers, factory workers and everyone who is giving up their own time to volunteer to help.

'I have in the past found it hard to return to the island but today, seeing the efforts being made by everyone, especially the search team, and seeing the support from all the media, I was so pleased.

'Many thanks.'

Despite a number of possible sightings
and a range of theories about what happened to him, no trace of the 
youngster has been found.

The new police operation is focusing on a mound of earth and rubble close to where Ben was last seen.

Mr Needham, told ITV Calendar News: 'It's a massive operation.

'The least I can do is what the police
ask me to do and come and show them where we did initially search the 
area and to point out where this mound was.'

Mr Needham said he has been back to the location over the years.

He said: 'It was a very traumatic experience but I'm sure this time it is for an absolute reason.'

A JCB driver said he was dumping earth in
an overgrown field next door to the farmhouse on the afternoon that  
21-month-old Ben went missing.

Yesterday, Kerry Needham, 41, told the Daily Mirror: 'If they find his bones my life is finished'.

The search of a mound in the field in the village of Iraklise is involving up to 22 British experts, scientists and officers, as well as the 
latest scanning technology – including instruments which detect bones.

Twenty five Greek rescuers will also be assisting with the 10-day dig on the plot of land which has now become a crime scene. 

The
dig follows an 18-month review of the case by South Yorkshire Police. 
It is the first time in 21 years that the land has been properly 
searched.

Authorities on Kos have granted a permit for the excavation based on ‘reasonable suspicions’ by British police.

The cost of the operation – certain 
to be a substantial five figure sum – will be paid by British taxpayers.

Ms Needham, who is on the 
island awaiting developments, said yesterday that she does not 
believe he was buried there. She dismisses claims he died by accident.

She is supporting the excavation as 
it will ‘eliminate speculation’ about an accidental death. She said she 
was pleased it would be going ahead ‘and it’s going to be a thorough and
proper investigation’.

She added: ‘Once they know that Ben 
is not in the area where he went missing from, then a full worldwide 
search is going to be done.

'When this search goes ahead it will prove that – and then everybody can concentrate on the real investigation.’

Police are confident the boy’s remains
will be found if he was buried there.

Their search involves 
expensive sonar ground-scanning equipment not available to the Greek 
authorities, two sniffer dogs trained to look for human remains, and a forensic 
archaeologist from a UK university.

Theories: Police believed that Ben may have wandered into tangled undergrowth and ended up under rubble the builders were dumping there

Ben’s DNA profile was obtained from a 
hospital blood test taken at birth and will be compared with any remains
that may be found.

Detective Superintendent Matt Fenwick, who is 
leading the inquiry, said: ‘We want to clear the ground from where Ben 
originally went missing to, if you like, finalise that as a line of 
inquiry.’

Ben vanished in July 1991 when Miss 
Needham, 19 at the time, left him with her parents Eddie and  Christine
while she worked at a local hotel.

The boy’s grandparents had emigrated 
to Kos and Mr Needham, a builder, was renovating the farmhouse next to 
the ‘mound’ which is about to be searched by police. Ben wandered off at
around 2.30pm.

Police were not contacted for at least
three hours because his grandparents thought he must have gone with 
Kerry’s brother Stephen, then 17, who left the farmhouse on his moped 
around the time Ben was last seen.

Police found no clues to explain what had happened. Over the years there have been hundreds of reported sightings of Ben.

Images showing what he would look like
as he grew up have been released. The latest was issued by the official
Ben Needham website and showed what he might have looked like in 2010 
aged 21.

Kerry Needham has dismissed previous claims that Ben was buried under rubble and insists he is still alive

Interest in the mound increased 
earlier this year when the JCB driver Konstantinos Barkas, 61, told how 
he had been excavating earth for a new property on the day Ben vanished.

He said: ‘Loads of earth were being taken to clear the ground. I think people were misled in thinking the child was abducted.

'Could there have been an accident? The little boy was two years old and the thorns in that field were as high as my waist.’

His account increased speculation Ben may have been buried by accident or murdered and then buried.
