A Nashville cafe owner who died after mistakenly locking himself inside a walk-in cooler at his restaurant suffocated to death within minutes, the medical examiner's office has found.

Jay Luther became trapped in the freezer at the Germantown Cafe East on Sunday night and was unable to get out as the mechanism to open the door had been left on a shelf outside, police said.

He was also unable to call for help as he had left his cellphone in his nearby condo, they added.

Authorities believe he died within two to five minutes. He suffocated from carbon dioxide vapours from dry ice that had been placed inside the cooler to preserve food after a power outage on Friday.

Tragic: Jay Luther, pictured last September, was suffocated by carbon dioxide fumes from dry ice after he became locked in a walk-in freezer. He had left his cell phone at home

'It's... an unfortunate coming together of circumstances for this poor gentleman that got trapped inside the freezer, at a time there was carbon dioxide there, and he was overwhelmed by the vapors,' Adele Lewis, deputy chief medical examiner, told The Tennessean after performing the autopsy.

The body of Mr Luther, 47, was found when an employee was unable to get in the building at around 9.15 a.m. and called the other co-owner, Chris Lowry. The two discovered the body and called 911.

Police are now investigating their own response to the scene, after it emerged officers responded to an alarm that had been set off inside the freezer on Sunday night, but did not check inside.

Mr Luther had gone to the restaurant on Sunday after the power returned and he went to check on the food in the freezer. At some point the door slammed shut behind him.

The button that opens the freezer from the inside was broken and had not been working for some time, The Tennessean reported.

Questions: Police, pictured at the scene after the body had been found, had gone to the restaurant after an alarm was set off in the freezer. They did not check inside as they thought it was a false alarm

There
is evidence that Luther fought to get out of the freezer by using 
cardboard to try and open the latch, Nashville police spokesman Don 
Aaron said.

'It turns out he plunger - the mechanism that would have opened the door from the inside - was actually on a shelf outside the cooler,' Aaron told NewsChannel5.com.

'As we know now, his cell phone was left in his condo nearby the restaurant. so he was in there without a phone and without the appropriate tool to open the cooler door.'

He added that officers responded to an alarm set off at the restaurant at 8.29 p.m. on Sunday and arrived outside the restaurant five minutes later.

'It was called into us as a hold up alarm from the cooler of the restaurant,' Aaron explained.

'When they got there they saw a sign on the door saying it was closed for the weekend due to a power outage. There was no indication whatsoever of any robbery taking place or that anyone was even inside the building.'

The police officers determined it was a false alarm caused by a power surge when the power returned to the building and left the scene.

It is uncertain whether Mr Luther would have still been alive when they arrived at the scene. The full autopsy report will be out in 10 to 14 weeks.

Luther's hair stylist, Adam Barnes, questioned whether the man’s death could have been prevented.

'It's
not the police’s job just to determine from the outside if there’s an 
emergency or not,' he told WKRN. 'They need to come in or at least 
call.'

Investigation: Police spokesman Don Aaron said a plunger for the inside of the door had been left outside and Luther had tried to use cardboard to try to open the latch

Colleagues and friends remembered the restaurant's co-owner as 'an awesome guy' and 'very well loved', WKRN reported.

Police are currently investigating the death, although no foul play is suspected.

Dry ice, the solid form of carbon dioxide, can cause asphyxiation in confined spaces because it displaces the oxygen in the air.
