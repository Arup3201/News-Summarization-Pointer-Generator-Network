Only one in 25 homes sold last month exceeded the asking price.

The figure, released yesterday by the National Association of Estate Agents, adds to evidence that the property market is finally cooling.

It found that just 4 per cent of buyers had to pay over the odds in July – compared with 20 per cent in both March and May. Two thirds of owners did not receive the advertised price.

Just 4 per cent of buyers paid more than the asking price for a house in July, while website Rightmove has revealed house prices had their biggest ever August fall, dropping 2.9 per cent

The website Rightmove has already said asking prices have had their biggest ever August fall – dropping 2.9 per cent on July.

More than 520 estate agents were interviewed by the NAEA, and nine out of ten said stamp duty was harming the market and needed reform.

A third agreed with the statement that the tax, which is paid on homes sold for more than £125,000, ‘frequently deters house buyers from moving to their ideal house’.

Until 1997, stamp duty was charged at just 1 per cent on all homes sold for £60,000 or more.

Today it is charged at that rate only on properties between £125,000 and £250,000. The rate is then 3 per cent up to £500,000, with rates continuing to rise to a maximum of 7 per cent on homes over £2million.

Mark Hayward, managing director of the NAEA, said there was growing evidence that house prices are ‘on the decline’.

He said: ‘A significant number of homes being sold are going for less than the asking price.

‘This not only signals an appetite for movement in the market, but is also positive news for current house buyers, especially when faced with the prospect of potentially having to pay higher rates of stamp duty for higher priced houses.’

Savills predicts house prices will continue to rise for the next five years across the UK, jumping by nearly 26 per cent by the end of 2018.

But it says the rate of annual growth will slow down significantly. Prices will supposedly rise by 9.5 per cent this year, but by only 4 per cent in 2015, slowing down to 3.5 per cent in both 2016 and 2017 and finally to 3 per cent in 2018.

Nine out of ten estate agents interviewed by the NAEA said stamp duty was hurting the property market and needed to be reformed

Lucian Cook, UK head of residential research at the estate agency, said: ‘These extraordinary rates of house price growth cannot continue in the current, more regulated mortgage environment, particularly in the face of likely interest rate rises.’

Around three million working parents in England are cutting back on buying food in order to be able to pay their rent or mortgage, according to the housing charity Shelter.

Its report, published today, warns that the budgets of many ordinary working families are ‘stretched to breaking point by high housing costs’.

They are at risk of losing their homes when the Bank of England raises the base rate from its historic low of 0.5 per cent.

Campbell Robb, chief executive of Shelter, said: ‘No parent should be forced to choose between putting food on the table and paying for the roof over their children’s heads.

‘These shocking figures show that millions of us are having to make these kind of agonising choices every day.'
