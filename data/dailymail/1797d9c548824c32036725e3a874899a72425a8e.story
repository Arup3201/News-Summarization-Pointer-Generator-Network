West Ham are braced for another blow, with Fulham set to make a £7.5million approach for Ravel Morrison and fellow midfielder Mohamed Diame.

West Ham manager Sam Allardyce is under huge pressure heading into Saturday's trip to Cardiff. He will be loath to lose Morrison but, as Sportsmail revealed on Friday, the former Manchester United youngster is unsettled at Upton Park and has told friends he is ready to quit the struggling club.

Fulham manager Rene Meulensteen, who worked with Morrison at United’s academy, is hoping to complete a double swoop before the end of the month.

The Dutchman refused to be drawn on a bid for Morrison but, when asked if the England Under 21 star was a player who needed special attention, he said: ‘Yes. It’s our responsibility as a coach to create the right environment. Ravel is a very talented player. He loves football and is a delight to coach.’

Morrison’s contract at West Ham expires at the end of next season and he is reluctant to sign a new one.

The Manchester-born midfielder announced his arrival on the Premier League stage with a stunning solo goal in West Ham’s win at Spurs in October.

And Meulensteen says he always expected as much from Morrison. ‘It’s not a surprise that he’s flourished and is doing well,’ he added. ‘There is so much more to come from him.

‘When you’re a young player and you’ve proved that you can play at this level then you want to get playing; you want to keep on going.’

Fulham, who entertain Sunderland this afternoon, will also look to include Diame in the deal. The Senegal midfielder is also out of contract next summer and Meulensteen said: ‘Any player that could be interesting for us and would really, really strengthen us, we will have a good look at.

‘It would be daft not to, that’s why the transfer windows are there. If things can be done and it’s possible then we’ll look at it like any other club.’

Fulham’s Costa Rica forward Bryan Ruiz will be allowed to leave — he is in talks with Real Betis over a loan move — but Meulensteen is keen to retain leading goalscorer Dimitar Berbatov.

The Bulgarian looks set to return to the starting line-up today, and his  manager said: ‘If he left, we would lose  quality, experience, that special aspect that makes him stand out from the  others. He can do things, turn things on, pull things out the hat. He is an exceptional player.’

Fulham have won two from three in the league to move two points clear of the drop zone and Meulensteen said: ‘The quality has been there and it is starting to pay off. Hopefully that will be the same against Sunderland, this is a huge game for us.’

Meanwhile, Sunderland’s Vito Mannone admits their form is even baffling the players.

The former Arsenal goalkeeper, who made several key saves in Tuesday’s 2-1 Capital One Cup semi-final victory over Manchester United, said: ‘It is a funny game. Somehow we produce great  performances against the big clubs. We all talk with each other and we can’t find the reason why we don’t beat the teams around us.

‘We were told to enjoy the semi-final because we had nothing to lose in a game against one of the best teams in the country. We have to approach every game in the same way. I am tired of  saying we have the team to compete, good ability and a good squad.

'You can tell when we play these games that we don’t beat these big clubs with luck. That’s four in a row.

‘We need to have the same attitude against the smaller teams. The smaller teams maybe put 10 bodies behind the ball, and it’s more open against the  better teams. We have to survive and give our all.

‘Fulham is definitely more important now. We have to compete and make sure we take three points.’
