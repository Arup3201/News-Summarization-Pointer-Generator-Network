As an international striker who starred for both Manchester teams, won the Treble with United ... and whose son, Devante, has been on City’s books since he was seven, Andy Cole is uniquely qualified to talk about the different philosophies at the two clubs.

Yet Cole feels strongly that it is ‘a nonsense’ to compare City’s policy of buying the best players aged between 16 and 18 from around the world to United’s long tradition of developing local youngsters, from the celebrated Class of 92 all the way through to today’s first-teamer Tyler Blackett.

But Cole is no City-basher. He scored 10 goals in 23 games for the club in 2005-06 having enjoyed spectacular success at United. He entrusted City with 19-year-old Devante’s footballing education because he felt ‘comfortable’ there.

But while Cole Snr learned about the United way from the likes of Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt, Wes Brown and the Neville brothers — all born and raised in Greater Manchester and brought through the ranks at Old Trafford — he cannot see how City’s £100million investment in the Etihad Academy can produce the same impact without enough young players from the local area who really know and care about the club.

Premier League rules state that a ‘homegrown’ player is someone who has spent three years at the club up to age 21. It means you can be signed by a club at 18 and still then be classified as ‘homegrown’.

Laughably, Wayne Rooney is categorised as a United homegrown player even though his formative years were spent at Everton and he was already an England player when Sir Alex Ferguson signed him for £27million in 2004.

City have stockpiled the best young talent from Austria, Spain, Portugal, France and Holland from their mid-teens.

Players like Marcos Lopes and Karim Rekik were signed at 17 and both are tipped for the top. They are currently on loan to top European clubs while Cole, who has been at the club for 12 years, is on loan at League One Barnsley having failed to make a first-team appearance for City.

Unsurprisingly, Cole Snr feels that despite the public emphasis from City on the importance of developing players, there is a marked difference between them and United.

‘Are you talking about real homegrown players, or players bought and called homegrown? It is a totally different entity,’ he says. ‘What I would call homegrown are kids who are born in Manchester or the UK, have gone to United or City as young kids and come through the system.

‘The rules say a homegrown player can be when you buy someone in and he’s there for three years. That means homegrown? It is a nonsense.’

Striker Cole enjoyed spectacular success during six seasons at Manchester United 

Cole scored 121 goals in six seasons at United from 1995 to 2001 during Ferguson’s heyday. He is now a club ambassador and puts a lot of what he has achieved down to being helped by the group who had come through the youth ranks.

‘Signing players from abroad at 16 or 17 is not the same as the Class of 92 that United had,’ he says fervently. ‘I played with those guys, they knew what it was to grow with United, they wanted to play for them and appreciated everything about the club. That’s homegrown — you don’t buy in homegrown talent.’

There have been fears United might reduce their priority on local players after a £158m spending spree on world stars like Angel Di Maria, which looked like an attempt to copy City rather than re-establish their own identity. Cole hopes that won’t be the case.

‘They should care about it (homegrown players) at United. If you look at the history, look at the number of local boys who have come through — that is the ethos of Manchester United,’ he argues.

‘If you look at the Treble winners or legends, look at the number of homegrown players they’ve had. Without people like Giggs, Butt, Scholes and Gary Neville, I wouldn’t be sitting here talking to you. It has to be possible to carry on.

‘Manchester is one of the biggest cities in England, if you can’t get talent from here, where can you get it from? Maybe I’m old-fashioned but that’s the way I look at it.’

Cole had no qualms, however, about letting Devante choose City.

‘He is a young boy who wants to make his way in football. He has been at City since he was a kid and if he makes it there, as a father I’m going to be happy,’ he says. ‘That is what he wants to do. He knows how tough it is to become a professional and if he makes a career at City, I’ll support him. But if he plays for Hotshot Hamish XI, I’m still going to support him, he’s my son. 

‘The most important thing for a father is that your son is comfortable. He has been at City since he was seven and it wasn’t for me to take him out of that system when he was comfortable.’

The bond that exists between a group of players that grow up together carries on long after retirement, according to Cole. It’s why he thinks Roy Keane’s recent barbs in his autobiography were aimed at Ferguson and his cronies, rather than his team-mates, who welcome Keane back to play in United old boys games.

‘I know Roy well, I have never had a problem with him and I could never see myself ever having a problem,’ said Cole. ‘We got on very well when we were playing and he took me to Sunderland when he was a manager. We all have opinions but I think if you look at what he said or the articles, I don’t think he mentioned any of the boys he actually played with.

‘When we catch up, we all have a laugh and a joke and that is the beauty of it, whatever someone has said.

‘We played one in Munich recently, that was a good one. I don’t think Roy has got an axe to grind.’

Andy Cole was speaking at the unveiling of the ‘Treble Collection’ and customised First Team squad watches by Bulova, Manchester United’s Official Timekeeping partner.
