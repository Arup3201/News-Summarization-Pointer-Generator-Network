A homeless man had spent three days trapped inside the wall of a Marshalls store in Colorado before firefighters were able to free him.

According to the Longmont Police Department, they received a call at around 9.30am Tuesday from store employees saying they could hear a man screaming for help.

The staffers were not sure where the pleas were coming from, but they believed the man was somewhere inside the department store.

Firefighters in Longmont, Colorado, had to cut into the wall of a Marshalls store with a circular saw to free 35-year-old Paul Felyk, who was sore and very cold

Rescue mission: Firefighters in Longmont, Colorado, came armed with a circular saw Tuesday morning to free a man who had been trapped inside the wall of a Marshalls store for three days 

Between a rock and a hard place: Paul Felyk, 35 is believed to be a vagrant who had snuck into the store through a vent in the roof and then fell 20 feet between the exterior and interior walls 

Mystery: Employees at the department store in Longmont had been hearing someone screaming since at least Monday but could not find the person anywhere 

Authorities said the man, later identified as 35-year-old Paul Felyk, from Westminster, was heard yelling the day before as well, but no one in the store was able to pinpoint his location, reported 9News.

When first responders arrived on the scene on Ken Pratt Boulevard, they quickly determined that Felyk somehow had become lodged between an exterior wall and interior wall.

Firefighters had to use a circular saw to slice into the facade of the store to free Felyk, who emerged into light just after 10am, according to Longmont Times-Call. 

According to police, Felyk, who is believed to be a vagrant, was able to move on his own but was very cold and sore from sitting in the cramped crawlspace for so long.

The 35-year-old was taken to Longmont United Hospital, where he was listed  in fair condition Tuesday.

Felyk, who is 6-foot-3 and weighing 195lbs, reportedly sneaked into the department store through a vent on the roof and then tumbled down 20 feet inside the wall.

First responders were called in and quickly determined that Felyk somehow had become lodged between an exterior wall and interior wall

Harrowing ordeal: Felyk was able to crawl out of the wall on his wall, but he was very cold and sore 

Not his first rodeo: Felyk has been charged with criminal trespass and theft in recent months 

Police are looking into possible charges of criminal trespass, but Felyk has not been arrested yet.

The 35-year-old man has had run-ins with the law under similar circumstances in recent months.

Law enforcement officials spent two months this summer tracking him down after he failed to appear in court in June on charges of criminal trespass of a dwelling and theft.

He was ultimately captured by the Westminster Police Department in August.
