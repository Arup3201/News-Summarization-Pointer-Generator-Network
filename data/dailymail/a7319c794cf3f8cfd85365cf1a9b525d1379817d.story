An elite private school in Indianapolis has apologized for serving fried chicken and collard greens to students as part of a ‘misguided’ attempt to celebrate Black History Month.

Several black students at Park Tudor School said they were hurt and disappointed when served the meal last Wednesday, supposedly in the name of raising cultural awareness.

‘We apologize for what was a clear error in judgment,’ said school officials. ‘We recognize the distress and hurt feelings this has caused within our entire community.’

Administrators said they realized the problem before lunch was served and removed references to Black History Month from the menu, reports the Indianapolis Star.

School officials blamed the menu mistake on Aladdin Food Management Services, which puts together meals without Park Tudor approval.

A school official said the menu was ‘unconsciously’ linked to Black History Month by the West Virginia-based food services provider, without realizing any racist connotation.

Fried chicken became ‘one of the most egregious stereotypes’ about blacks, along with watermelon, to emerge from minstrel shows, said Jakobi Williams, an Indiana University history professor.

According to recent data, there are only 67 black students out of a total of 950 at Park Tudor School where tuition is $15,000 to $19,000 a year

‘There are more important things you can do with Black History Month than a menu,’ Williams said. ‘I don’t think students are going to learn much from a menu.’

Critics said the problem is a symptom of a greater issue at the school.

'I’m not surprised,' said John Stanfield, of the Greater Indianapolis NAACP.

'Park Tudor is in serious need of getting very serious in developing effective inclusion and equality. Otherwise, their students are going to have a hard time transitioning in this world.'
