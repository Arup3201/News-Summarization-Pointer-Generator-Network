It's not always easy to stay grounded as a fourteen-year-old signed up to a top side's youth academy, but for Newcastle's new signing Remy Cabella there was a calming influence in the shape of a group of nuns.

Cabella, when he signed for Montpellier ten years ago, was sent to live in a convent while he began to develop as a footballer.

And it appears to have worked for the French midfielder, who was called into Laurent Blanc's World Cup squad this summer to replace Franck Ribery.

But the Corsican-born player says it was a difficult process, albeit one that has led to success in the long term.

'When you're 14 you don't say to yourself "I'm off to live with some sisters"', Remy told The Sun. 'Especially when you're a footballer.'

'Sister Philomene was the first to remark about the fact I wore earrings. She wanted to rip them out and I said "No sister, no! You shouldn't'

'I'd put some posters of Cristiano Ronaldo up next to my bed and she made me taken them down. But as soon as she was gone I'd put them straight back up.' 

Cabella eventually left the convent but stayed at Montpellier for a decade, scoring 28 times for the first team before earning his move to Newcastle. 

He is expected to make his debut in Sunday's game against Manchester City, with the home fans expecting him to bring some much needed creativity to their side.
