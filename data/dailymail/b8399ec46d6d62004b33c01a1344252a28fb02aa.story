Amanda Knox’s former boyfriend said today he will testify in the murder retrial if he is called and revealed his life has been put on hold because of the 'nightmare'.

Knox's retrial over the murder of Meredith Kercher opened in Florence today - but neither the American student nor her Italian ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito was there to see the start of proceedings.

Speaking from his home in Switzerland, Raffaele told the Today show he believes the authorities are going to destroy his life.

'It seems to be a never-ending saga of a nightmare,' he said. 'My life is still
on hold and I can't move on or make plans for my future.

Nightmare: Raffaele Sollecito told the Today show he doesn't see a future and he has had to put his life on hold because of the ongoing saga of the trial

Raffaele Sollecito told Savannah Guthrie: 'It is a big huge mistake against two human beings, we are innocent and we are fighting for our innocence'

Refusal: Speaking on the Today show last week, Amanda Knox
said it was 'common sense' that she will not return to Italy for the 
re-trial in the murder of her British roommate in 2007

'Actually I don't
see any real future for me...They 
destroyed my life once, they are still going to destroy my life in this 
period as well.'

Speaking about his former girlfriend - who he had only been seeing for one week when Meredtih Kercher was murdered - Raffaele said he understands why Knox did not return to Italy for the trial and said he has no regrets.

'It's her decision [to come back], she is an adult and can make whatever decision she wants,' he said.

'As I said before, I never regret it, it is not her fault what is happening. It is a big huge mistake against two human beings.

'We are innocent and we are fighting for our innocence. I do not regret meeting her because she has nothing to do with this tragedy.'

Sollecito had been dating Amanda Knox in Italy for just one week when the couple came under investigation for the murder of British university student Kercher back in 2007

Knox was spotted taking a walk in the rain in her hometown of Seattle yesterday seemingly without a care in the world.

She
said repeatedly in the run-up to the retrial that she will not return 
to Italy where she is accused of murdering her British roommate in 2007.

The 26-year-old and Raffaele served
four years in jail for the murder of Meredith Kercher, who was found 
semi-naked with her throat slit in the flat she shared with Knox in 
Perugia, Italy.

Both were freed on appeal in 2011 but in March this year Italy’s highest court sensationally ordered them to face retrial.

In
June, judges published the reasons for that decision, saying the ruling
by the appeal court that freed them was full of ‘deficiencies 
contradictions and illogical conclusions’.

Knox has said that her decision not to attend the re-trial was ‘common sense’.

‘I was imprisoned as an innocent person and I just can’t re-live that,’ said told the Today show last week.

In
a memoir released earlier this year, Knox sought to portray herself as a
naive young woman railroaded by a foreign justice system and not a 
callous sexual deviant as she was painted in many reports after her 
initial conviction.

Knox is not obliged to attend the retrial and can be represented by her lawyers.

If found guilty, she would be able to appeal again, but Italy could apply for her extradition if that failed.

On trial: Knox claims that Italian prosecutors made up the fact that she was a sexual deviant to bolster their case against her

Account: Knox has written about her experiences 
in her book, left, which was released on April 30. In it she says she 
details her friendship with Meredith Kercher, right, who was killed in 
their apartment in 2007

On November 1, 2007, the Kercher's
bloody body was found in the Perugia home she shared with Knox, 
sustaining 47 wounds including a fatal slash across her 
throat.

Knox's seemingly bizarre behavior - joking around and kissing her Italian boyfriend Raffaele 
Sollecito, who was also convicted of the murder before he was acquitted - made her prime suspect.

Knox says she was never at home when it happened but was at the apartment of her boyfriend of just one week, Sollecito.

Following Knox's and Sollecito's release from prison last year, 
Sollecito moved to Switzerland while she returned to Seattle to finish 
her creative writing degree at the University of Washington.

A
third suspect, Rudy Guede, whose DNA and bloody footprints were found 
all over the crime scene, is serving a 16-year prison sentence for Miss 
Kercher’s murder.

She faces a possible re-trial in the case.
