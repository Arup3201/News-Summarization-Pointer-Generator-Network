Marijuana use has been in fashion for years but now that it's becoming legal, the trend is being incorporated into clothing design-that can actually get you high.

Hoodie companies VapRwear and Hood Horkerz feature hoodies that have built in pot smoking devices for easy use.

Hood Horkerz feature a pipe sweater that has a glass bowl on one end of the drawstring and a mouthpiece on the other. The sweatshirt costs $124 each.

Smoking rivals: The owner of Hood Horkerz says he created the first pot smoking and vape smoking jacket before the VapRwear line ever even came out 

Rival company VapRwear features a hood lace with a vaporizer from which you can inhale e-juice, oil, dry herb, or wax. The hpodie usually costs $125 but is now on sale for $99.

'I invented the pipe hoodies back in 2011 in Vermont,' Hook Horkerz owner Sean Oliver told BuzzFeed.

'I was at my buddy’s snowboard shop and he didn’t have a pipe to smoke out of and I kinda pulled on my hoodie strings and was like, "Man! This would be the perfect place for a pipe!"'

Oliver made his way down to Home Depot, built a hoodie, and then brought it to a party.

'Everyone was like, "Aw man, where can I get one?" And I was like, "Nowhere… yet."'

'About two weeks after that I invented the vape one,' the Santa Cruz, California resident said.

'I just decided to go with the pipe one because it cost less money.'

VapRwear: Caribbean native Elvis 'Papi' Edwards says  the vape  on his hoodieis kept in a discrete pocket and comes with a USB charger

The hood lace is made out of silicone tubing and outside fire retardant shoe lace material.

The ends are made of hand-blown glass, says Oliver.

VapRwear owner Elvis 'Papi' Edwards who is from the Caribbean said he doesn't even smoke weed.

Edwards' father was 'in the weed business,' he says.

'Everybody thought I was gonna be the biggest drug dealer, but I never even smoked weed!' he said.

Edwards says he only smokes hemp oil out of his vapes.

'I didn’t want to get into the weed business because that’s still frowned on in my country,' he said.

New suits: Rappin 4 Tay wore a Hood Horkerz pipe suit to this year's Grammy's and may be the hottest new style in LA where marijuana is partially legalized  

New ideas: Sean Oliver of Hood Horlerz (pictured) says that Elvis 'Papi' Edwards stole his idea and that he paid for a patent 

'But last 4/20 in Denver, I saw this opportunity. I saw the future. Eight months later, VapRwear happened.'

Oliver claims he invented a vapor sweatshirt first but Edwards says he's the vaporizer pioneer.

Oliver claims he paid a lawyer to make sure no one else had thought of a similar idea, and then filed a patent for both the pipe hoodie and the vaporizer hoodie.

He says the vape hoodie has been pending since 2013 but that they will manufacture them this summer.

'If you are a designer and you don’t have a smokable line, you are out of business,' Papi told BuzzFeed News.

'I swear, next New York Fashion Week, you’ll see VapRwear on the runway.'

'Oh yeah, smokable clothing is it,' Oliver echoed. “'Everyone will be wearing it soon.'
