Unbelievable: Homeless teenager Samantha Garvey has won a semi-final place in a science competition which has a $100,000 top prize

Samantha Garvey's passion isn't one you might normally associate with a 17-year-old girl.

While most of her peers enjoy a good gossip and thumb through pages of the latest fashion magazines, she loves nothing more than developing her research into mussels and their environment.

Samantha's work has won her a semi-final place in a prestigious science competition with a potential $100,000 college scholarship for the winner - and all while being homeless.

'Itâ€™s unbelievable,' Samantha told 
ABC News. 'It might as well be the lottery. I want to do better for 
myself. I want a better life.'

The
teenager, who studies at Brentwood High School in New York, and her 
family have been living in shelters since she was very young.

Her parents and two younger siblings had moved into a house seven years ago, but were evicted in February 2010.

Despite not having a desk to carry out 
her studies or a stable home life, Samantha now hopes her work on ribbed
mussels and how they adjust their characteristics in response to their 
environment will help her change her own life.

'I get so excited to tell people about my mussels and crabs that I become a completely different person,' she told ABC News.

Samantha,
who also plays the violin and speaks Italian, has been named one of 300
semi-finalists in the Intel Science Talent Search thanks to her work on
a project called 'The Effects of Physical Environment and Predators on 
Phenotypic Plasticity in Geukensia demissa'.

All those selected as semi-finalists 
will get a $1,000 award, while the 40 finalists, to be announced on 
January 25, will go to Washington, D.C., where last year's finalists met
with President Barack Obama.

Determined: Samantha has a desk at school on which to study, but not at home, making her efforts even more remarkable

They will also earn scholarships ranging from $7,500 to the top $100,000, according to Intel.

Her father, Leo Garvey, told HLN: She is very special.

'She's a hard worker, very driven and dedicated to anything and everything that she does.'
