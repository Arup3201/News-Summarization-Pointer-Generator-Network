Diego Costa didn’t deserve to be dismissed on Saturday and Kevin Friend called both incidents involving the combative centre forward correctly.

In the first, Costa over-reacted to a strong challenge from John O’Shea, pushing his legs and boots out towards the Sunderland centre half. O’Shea ignored the act and merely jogged back into position rather than make a meal of the clash. This reaction must be applauded as, if Friend had considered disciplining Costa, O’Shea made it easy to ignore the misdemeanour.

In the second half the Chelsea forward was a little unlucky after his trailing arm caught Wes Brown in the face during an aerial challenge.

It was not a deliberate act – a player will clench his fist to give power through the elbow if he wants to hurt the opponent – but worthy of a yellow card as he should have been more aware of the consequences of his movement.

While Friend did well with these two incidents it was very disappointing to see him ignoring the open, and blatant, grappling by Sunderland’s defenders at Chelsea set pieces. They clearly saw Gary Cahill and John Terry as dangers and, in what looked like pre-planned tactics, held them at almost every set piece.

Elsewhere we saw an excellent performance from new referee Graham Scott making his Premier League debut at Turf Moor. 

His quick reactions to a poor and late Dean Marney sliding challenge on Ciaran Clark stopped the Aston Villa man from retaliating more than he did, which would have probably resulted in a red card.

Scott was then absolutely right to award the home side a penalty when Villa defender pulled down Burnley’s Lukas Jutkiewicz just inside the penalty area.

Two offside decisions caught the eye – one very good and one not so good.

First a superb one from World Cup final assistant Mike Mullarkey who was spot on in allowing Joe Cole’s goal for Aston Villa. 

The bad one came at the Hawthorns with the score at 0-0. Saido Berahino was flagged offside when clean through but replays showed he was just onside.

Finally, too often we blame referees for poor decisions but Newcastle’s Moussa Sissoko must take all the plaudits for his actions at West Ham. He left Mike Dean with no option but to caution him when he whacked the ball miles away after giving a clear free kick away. Then just under 50 seconds later he trod on an opponent to get his second yellow card.
