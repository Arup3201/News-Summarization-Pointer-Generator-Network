The woman at the center of the Vanderbilt University footballer rape scandal did not believe she had been assaulted at first because she was dating one of the four accused players, a new report has revealed.

The female victim, who has not been identified, initially told police that she was romantically involved with one of the students and believed he would not have allowed anything bad to happen to her.

She even admitted to having consensual sex with him in the days following the alleged sexual assault.

It was not until she heard about the pictures and video of the three other players 'attacking her' that she found out about the alleged assault.

Brandon Vandenburg is one of the four accused football players, and the young woman said that she met up with him at a local bar on the night of June 23.

'(The victim) advised she trusted Vandenburg and he would not let anything happen to her,' Nashville police Sgt. Mike Shreeve revealed new details in his investigative report, highlights of which were published by The Tennessean.

The alleged victim did not have any recollection of being raped, and only had her suspicion raised after hearing that there was a video and pictures of her being assaulted while unconscious.

'(The victim) advised she had been drinking heavily and has very little/no memory of events that took place,' the report stated.

'Advised she does not think she was sexually assaulted did not "feel" like she had sex.'

She told police that she spoke with Vandenburg with no contention after June 23 and had 'consensual sex with him within a few days following this incident'.

It was only after speaking with a victim's advocate at the police station that the young woman decided to submit herself for a rape kit.

One of the key pieces of evidence backing the police's charges is surveillance footage provided by the University.

The
 Tennessean reports that the footage shows three black men and one white
 man- whose identities were not explicitly stated by the school 
officials- are seen carrying a young woman wearing a short skirt.

The skirt did not cover her throughout the video meaning that her 'private area was sometimes exposed'.

That skirt and the other clothing she was wearing on the night of the attack are now being held by police and used as evidence.

BuzzFeed previously revealed information about the night of the sex assault, during which Vandenburg and three other players allegedly smashed through a security door before one of the suspects covered a surveillance camera in the hallway with a towel.

Several students later recalled hearing a loud bang that night, which turned out to be the sound of a door being knocked off the hinges in the second-floor hallway.

The force with which the door was broken would eventually lead authorities to suspect that football players may have been involved.

Investigators working on the case believe that Mr Vandenburg brought his passed-out date to his room and had sex with her without consent, with three of his teammates present at one point or another in the course of the night.

According to BuzzFeed sources, unnamed objects were also employed to sexually penetrate the unconscious student, and Vandenburg used his cell phone to allegedly take graphic photos and record video, which he later sent to four people.

Warning: Vandenburg's new attorney Fletcher Long argues that the evidence is being exaggerated and his client is 'absolutely innocent'

It remains unclear whether the alleged rape victim remained in Vandenburgâ€™s room until the next morning, or whether she was carried to another room in the dormitory.

Vanderburg spoke out for the first time on November 25, with his team of lawyers at his side.

'I'm innocent and I'm going to fight that to the very end,' the 20-year-old transfer student said to News Channel 5.

'It's been extremely difficult for me. I came to play football and a great education. That would be the reason to come to Vanderbilt and that's not what I got.'

He was most recently seen at a hearing on Tuesday before Thanksgiving where his new attorneys claimed he is 'absolutely innocent' as the evidence against him has been 'exaggerated and completely oversold'.

'I believe that when the truth comes out, people who rushed to judgment in this particular case are going to have regret,' defense attorney Fletcher Long said according to ABC 6 of Knoxville, Tennessee.

The other football players who face two counts of aggravated sexual battery are 19-year-olds Cory Batey, Brandon Banks and Jaborian 'Tip' McKenzie.
