This nearly half-century-old Amazon boomtown has gone bust with the government's recent crackdown on illegal gold mining.

Mayor Marco Ortega estimates more than 22,000 people have left Huepetuhe since the government halted gasoline shipments in April and sent troops to destroy heavy machinery used in mining that it deemed illegal.

He says only about 3,000 people remain.Â

'The 
economy has collapsed,' says Ortega. 'The gold buyers, the hardware 
stores, hostels and all kinds of businesses have shut down. We are 
nearly a town without people.'

The brothels that flank a broad mud flat of mining runoff are now all but idle, as are most gas stations.

The
 government official overseeing the crackdown has said authorities plan 
to provide work for miners rendered jobless, but Ortega says no 
assistance has arrived.

According
 to official figures, wildcat miners have extracted 159 million metric 
tons of gold worth $7 billion over the past decade from the Madre de 
Dios region that includes Huepetuhe.

The 
environmental cost has been high, with huge scars gouged out of the 
rainforest that are visible from outer space and tons of mercury, a 
toxin used to bind mined gold flecks, released into the environment and 
contaminating the food chain in a region of rich biodiversity where 
several indigenous tribes live in voluntary isolation.

The
 government gave informal miners until April 19 to formalize any claims 
they might have, but the vast majority didn't have any.

One 
lingering miner, 25-year-old Joel Maceda, had been earning $1,071 a 
month as a heavy machinery operator.

The father of two says he now 
struggles to earn a quarter of that, and his wife now pitches in.

'She works with me because we have nothing to eat,' says Maceda, his two-month-old on a blanket on the ground.

Rather
 than return to his native highlands city of Cuzco and start over, 
Maceda hopes the government will let some mining resume in Huepetuhe. 
Not all operations there were illegal.

'The government may be doing things right by ending illegal mining, but they should have thought of us, the lowliest workers.'
