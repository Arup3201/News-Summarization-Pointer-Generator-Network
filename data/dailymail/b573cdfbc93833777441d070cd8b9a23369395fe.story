The charity says children will be more motivated to work if they have an encouraging start

All children should start the school year with an A grade and should never be told they have failed, according to a controversial guide for teachers.

Pupils should be awarded the top grade automatically and told to work to maintain it, the influential Royal Society of Arts says.

The charity claims teachers should harness the motivating power of ‘loss aversion’.

All pupils should be given an A in a particular subject and must continuously improve to keep it.

‘Consider having each pupil start with an A or a number of gold stars, with points or stars docked when appropriate,’ the guide says.

The researchers said the approach would not necessarily mean that students ended up with As.

The guidance includes the alternative idea of giving children grade targets to achieve, but instead of telling those who are struggling that they have an F grade – a ‘fail’ – encourage them with ‘not yet’ grades that show they can still reach their goal.

The RSA, which was founded in 1754 and includes worldwide web inventor Tim Berners-Lee and former Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey as fellows, publishes an alternative curriculum that is followed by more than 200 schools, many of them  state academies.

But Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said: ‘It is far better to have an  honest starting point than to have  a fake or fraudulent starting point – it’s ludicrous.

‘Children need to start from the beginning and not from the end. They need to aspire to an A grade. They shouldn’t start at the finish line. It’s ridiculous.’

Mr McGovern, a former prep school headmaster, added: ‘Children learn from failure. We all learn from failure. Children have to be told they can fail and not be constantly praised.

Critics claim the move is deceptive and patronising to students who should be treated with honesty

‘Children want teachers to be honest and frank with them – it is only silly educationists who have these ideas about failure.’

Further ideas in the guide include giving pupils views of nature or potted plants to reduce aggression.

Teachers are also urged to ‘prime’ pupils by asking them to write an ‘A’ on exam papers before they start writing to boost their performance.

The RSA’s latest guide was produced by its Social Brain Centre. The charity is an influential forum for thinkers across a range of topics and has 27,000 members.

It calls itself an ‘enlightenment organisation’, dedicated to finding ‘innovative practical solutions to today’s social challenges’.
