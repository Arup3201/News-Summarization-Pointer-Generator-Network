The girl's distraught father Barry Sargent told Fox Carolina: 'It's a nightmare. I just want to know. If she would call and say ''I'm here. I'm safe. I'm not coming home until next week.'' I would be happy. 

'I don't care where she is as long as she lets somebody know she's safe.'

Laurens County Sheriff's Office confirmed to MailOnline on Tuesday that Miss Sargent is now safely back at home with her family.   

Enoree is located in Spartanburg County with a population of 665 people.
