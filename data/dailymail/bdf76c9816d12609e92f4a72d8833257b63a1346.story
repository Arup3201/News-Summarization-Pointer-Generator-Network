A row over money owed from full back Stephen Warnock’s move from Aston Villa to Leeds in January 2013 has led to Elland Road refusing to deal with football agents SEM in future.

Leeds consultant Graham Bean, effectively in day-to-day control for Italian owner Massimo Cellino, has cut any ties with SEM following incendiary texts sent to him by their managing director Craig Honeyman.

One text from Honeyman infuriated Bean, highly respected former FA compliance chief. It read: ‘Pathetic old policeman trying to throw his weight around. It doesn’t work without the uniform old man. I will meet you anywhere any time no problem. Don’t ever try to threaten or intimidate me. I’ve seen your waistline.’

Dispute: Leeds are now refusing to work with SEM after a dispute over money in Stephen Warnock's deal

Bean said: ‘Mr Honeyman needs to be a lot more professional in his dealings with clubs. Sending such immature messages is not acceptable in any form of business.’

Honeyman took over as CEO after Jerome Anderson resigned last September. He said: ‘Commission was due on a deal. Leeds didn’t want to pay. Our lawyers dealt with the matter. Payment was received and we all move on.’

Amir Khan has eloquent knowledge of boxing, both amateur and professional, which will ensure he is in high demand as a pundit when he hangs up his gloves. And his passion for the sport while working for BBC on Commonwealth Games boxing contrasts sharply with the tired track and field coverage.

The BBC’s biggest extravagance at the Games has to be the temporary studio they have built on the River Clyde just 300 yards from BBC Scotland’s headquarters with its huge broadcasting capacity.

The Beeb felt they needed a backdrop of the ‘Armidillo’ Clyde Auditorium and the Hydro concert hall, but wouldn’t reveal the hefty hire fee for this vanity project which includes nine days of construction and another week spent dismantling it from tomorrow night.

One of the Games winners has been sportswear brand Kukri, who have greatly raised their profile by supplying kit for Team England in a value in kind deal. Kukri pleased athletes by involving them in the design, leading to the third colour of maroon along with red and white on the clothing.

Hooper’s drug denial

New Zealander Mike Hooper, chief executive of the Commonwealth Games Federation, said yesterday he had run out of superlatives to describe his own event, including the drug-ridden weightlifting competition among the ‘great, brilliant, outstanding wonderful competitions.’

All this hyperbole before announcing Nigerian Chika Amalaha, 16, had failed a second drugs test. She was later stripped of her weightlifting gold medal.

How can Hooper — who is stepping down after Glasgow — praise any sport, let alone weightlifting with its serial drug offenders, whose coaches can corrupt a young athlete to such devastating effect?

England Rugby 2015 have had a team of observers in Glasgow examining what they can learn from the Games, including the transport arrangements.

These are sure to be a complex business at the Rugby World Cup as well. The railway station at Cardiff, which hosts eight games, is a concern judging by complaints about the crush and two-hour queues in the rain after the Heineken Cup final.

An ER 2015 spokeswoman said: ‘We are developing a detailed transport plan for each game at the Millennium Stadium.’

Mark Palios, former FA chief executive, is in detailed talks to take a controlling interest in struggling League Two Tranmere. Palios made 190 appearances for the club from 1973-80 while also developing his career as a chartered accountant and business turnaround specialist.

The deal, which is expected to go through, does depend on terms being agreed over the next week with millionaire owner Peter Johnson, founder of the Park Group, who has been looking for new investors for almost a decade and has written off £5m worth of debt owed to him.

Palios resigned from the FA in August 2004 after revelations about his relationship with Faria Alam, who also had an affair with Sven Goran Eriksson.
