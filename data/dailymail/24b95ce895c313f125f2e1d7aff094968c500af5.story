The zebra crossing is facing extinction just as it prepares to celebrate its 60th anniversary in Britain, experts have revealed.

The iconic crossing is being phased out and replaced with more sophisticated substitutes after a rise in deaths in the last four years.

Ironically, the crossings were first introduced in Britain to tackle mounting road deaths in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

Not so black and white: Many motorists do not heed the rules of the road when approaching the crossings, failing to give pedestrians right of way

But it seems the effectiveness of the crossing today could be in decline as it emerged many drivers fail to stop for pedestrians walking over the black and white painted pathway.

The first zebra crossing was 
officially opened in Slough, Berkshire, on October 31, 1951 and the 
crossings have been a prominent feature of the British landscape for six
 decades.

However, during the last five years more than
 1,000 zebra crossings have vanished and many others have been replaced 
by fewer more sophisticated alternatives with lights and flashing signs.

Low fines and the reluctance of motorists to stop have also seen deaths on zebra crossings double in the last four years.

Andrew Hammond, head of road safety at the AA, said: 'Zebra crossings are looked on as 
inferior to other pedestrian crossings as there is no red light telling 
cars to stop.

'In towns and villages there is a 
pressure from residents for councils to fit pelican crossings as they 
believe they are safer, so zebras are being phased out.

'I suspect zebra crossings will 
continue to have a role in some busy town centres where they can be 
effective at helping people cross without constantly stopping the 
traffic.

'But in villages and towns I think 
they will eventually become extinct.'

The Government decided to 
introduce zebra crossings in 1951 as road traffic fatalities were 
mounting.

Post-war Britain only had 10 per cent 
of its current traffic, but crossings were only marked with metal studs 
in the road, which were easy for pedestrians to see, but difficult for 
motorists.

The Ministry of Transport experimented
 with different pedestrian crossing markings to help improve visibility 
and considered both blue and yellow stripes and even red and white 
stripes.

'We need to put in the right type of crossing and make decisions
 based on evidence not nostalgia'

Black and white stripes were 
eventually found to have the best visual impact and after they were 
introduced pedestrian deaths dropped by 11 per cent in the first year.

MP Jim Callaghan is credited with first noting the crossing's resemblance to a zebra and the name stuck.

But despite their initial road safety 
success, by 1960 more than 500 people died on zebra crossings in the UK 
in just six months.

This led to the introduction of the panda crossing in 1962, a signal controlled pedestrian crossing with lights.

Government figures show five people 
were killed on zebra crossings last year and 144 people were seriously 
injured, compared to just three people who died in 2006.

One reason for this is the fines in 
Britain are considerably lower for a motorist prosecuted for not 
stopping at a crossing compared to many other countries.

In the UK a motorist face a £60 fine 
and three points on his or her driving licence.  But in Italy, for 
example, the fine is anywhere from £111 to £443, while in Belgium the 
maximum fine can reach more than £2,000.

A zebra crossing costs about £10,000, 
while pelican and puffin crossings - which are operated in part by the 
pedestrian - cost around £35,000.

Last year 24 people were killed at 
pelican crossings, even though pedestrians feel safer if they have the 
protection of a traffic light.

Mr Hammond said the solution is having
 more crossing points for pedestrians, even if they are not 
fully-fledged zebras or pelicans.

'Zebra-crossings could be down-graded 
so they indicate a good place for pedestrians to cross and motorists 
know to watch out for them, but are not legally obliged to stop,' he 
said.

Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said a lot had changed on the roads in the last 60 years.

He added: 'Zebra crossings are iconic parts of the road network. But over 60 years a lot has happened.

'The amount of traffic has increased 
nearly ten-fold and changing technology has meant new ways of helping us
 get over the road have been developed.

'The important thing is that we
 put in the right type of crossing at the right place and make decisions
 based on evidence not nostalgia.

'After that we need adequate 
enforcement of the law which says pedestrians have the right of way. It 
is not optional to stop at a crossing in use; it is compulsory.'

The 
Beatles brought international fame to the British zebra crossing in 1969
 with their album cover for Abbey Road.

Late last year, the iconic crossing was granted a Grade II listing in the capital to preserve the site.

Many
 a tourist has followed in the footsteps of Paul McCartney, John Lennon,
 George Harrison and Ringo Starr, by posing for pictures on the black 
and white painted pathway.
