A single mother has been told she cannot take her eight-year-old  to a father-daughter dance - because organizers want to keep the event 'authentic'.

Shawna Steeves was asked by daughter Meghan to be her date for the  event at Southwest Elementary School in Lawson, Missouri, as the youngster considers her to be both her mother and father.

The 30-year-old, who recently moved to the area to be closer to her family, said she would be honored to accompany Meghan, but checked with the school first to make sure she could attend.

The principle initially said yes, but the PTO overturned the decision because they wanted to make sure the dance maintained its integrity.

They told Miss Steeves that any other male figure - including uncles or grandparents - were more than welcome to attend.  But Meghan insists she wants her mother there. 

The mom was left devastated, having already bought her daughter a black and white dress with a purple sash - Meghan's favorite color.

She told FoxK4: 'If you’re going to have that and you’re going to tell someone to bring their father figure, why not me? I’m just as good.

'I would love to find a substitute so she could go. I have. She ultimately turns around and says, "you’re my mom and you’re my dad" and I would love to go with you 

Disappointment: The PTO said Miss Steeves could not accompany her daughter to the dance because it would damage the integrity of the event. They told her any other male figure would suffice 

Kacey Collier, the Southwest PTO president, issued a statement, saying: 'Our PTO works very hard at creating events that give ample opportunity for all families to participant in throughout the year. 

'Regarding the situation with this event there were several options given to this family and all families so that all Southwest elementary school aged girls are welcome to attend regardless of their family situation. Our goal is to keep this special event authentic. 

'We offer many other events that are family oriented. Examples would be muffins with mom and donuts with dad, the family 5 k walk/run, pancakes with Santa, Trunk or treat and our mother son challenge. We are very proud of our organization and what we do for the students and our community.'

When Miss Steeves broke the news to her daughter, the youngster said she would write a letter to the school in a bid to have the decision overturned. 

Response: Meghan has now insisted she will write a letter to the school in a bid to have the decision overturned
