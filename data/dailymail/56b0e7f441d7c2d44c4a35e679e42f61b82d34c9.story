His Manchester United debut lasted 69 minutes but in that time Angel di Maria gave Red Devils supporters more than a glimpse of what is to come from their new No 7 in the future.

Di Maria has only trained twice with his new team-mates, since his £60million move from Real Madrid on Tuesday, yet in spells on Saturday afternoon at Turf Moor it seemed he had been at  United longer as he linked up neatly with Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie.

Old Trafford boss Louis van Gaal deployed the 26-year-old in central midfield of his 3-5-2 formation and Di Maria showed his energetic qualities that helped Real win a Copa del Rey and Champions League double last term.

United's early season performances have been lethargic and the Argentina international added a much-needed injection of pace going forward.

In the opening stages at Burnley Di Maria's first involvement in the match saw a trademark dribble ended by an over-hit pass into the path of Rooney.

The skill involved, as he beat two men in the heart of Burnley's midfield, was warmly appreciated by the travelling United supporters who chanted 'Argentina! Argentina!' in honour of their new £60m acquisition.

Di Maria's influence into the match grew as United weathered the opening 10-minute storm from Sean Dyche's side who pressed and pressurised the visitor's shaky defence.

The midfielder's move to the Theatre of Dreams broke the British transfer record fee and United supporters got their first insight into why their club paid a premium price to acquire Di Maria's talents on 14 minutes.

Collecting the ball on the half-way line, Di Maria sprayed a beautiful 40-yard pass into the path of Van Persie who saw his shot saved by Tom Heaton.

At Real last season, the Argentine created the most assists in Europe's top five leagues with 17, and the vision he showed to pick out Van Persie was evident in what was the move of the match.

That pass was one of 33 he attempted on his debut at Turf Moor, and the midfielder soon once again neatly linked up with Van Persie to create another opening for Van Gaal's side.

Surging down the left flank, he performed a one-two with Van Persie, flicking the ball to the Dutchman, before crossing to Juan Mata who slipped just as he was about to shoot from 10 yards out.

Playing nominally in the heart of United's midfield there were times however when Di Maria struggled to cope with his defensive duties.

Primarily brought in as an attack-minded player the former Real galactico lost half of his personal duels when challenging for the ball.

Blank canvas: Di Maria failed to register any tackles, clearances or blocks during the match vs Burnley

He failed to register any tackles, clearances or blocks and was at fault for man-of-the-match David Jones' blistering volley that David de Gea did well to tip over for a corner in the first-half.

Van Gaal didn't buy Di Maria for his defensive abilities though and the Dutchman must find a way to utilise his new signing's main assets in a different way - be it with a change of formation perhaps as his winless start in the United hotseat continues.

For Real and Argentina - Di Maria shone in a 4-3-3 formation drifting out to the left-hand side during matches from his central role and his most destructive work for United came in the second-half doing just that but in Van Gaal's 3-5-2 formation.

On 52 minutes he gave the Burnley defence a warning of his speed, providing Rooney an overlap before seeing his drive blocked by Kieran Trippier.

Six minutes later the 26-year-old showed his blistering pace out-muscling and out-sprinting Trippier down the left flank before his ricocheted cross found Rooney.

The newly-appointed England captain's mishit effort fell back to Van Persie who saw his deflected left-footed volley cleared off the line by Dean Marney.

Expensive taste: Di Maria's £60m to United broke a British record transfer fee 

Shortly after that thrilling burst though, Di Maria's afternoon was ended when he was replaced by Anderson on 69 minutes.

Moments before that the Premier League's most expensive player went down with cramp much to the worry with everyone connected to the club.

Van Gaal later confirmed that his latest signing was taken off as a precaution after taking a kick to his calf.

Overall Di Maria's performance was the only real positive for United as they struggled to break down Premier League new boys Burnley.

His industrious display mixed with his unquestionable quality will be a welcome addition to United as they look to rebuild from last season's disastrous campaign.

It's clear that United have problems elsewhere though and Van Gaal has until the transfer window closes on September 1 to address these problems.

If not, then the qualities of Di Maria may not get to be displayed at the Theatre of Dreams as often as United supporters will wish for.

Encouraging start: United fans will be hoping Di Maria can kick on after making his debut for the club
