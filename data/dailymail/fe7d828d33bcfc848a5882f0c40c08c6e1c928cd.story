A 90-year-old grandfather survived for four days trapped in his car after breaking his arm and hip at a grocery store.

Justyn Ambrozia, known to friends as Jay, fell during a shopping trip last week but was helped to his feet by store workers and managed to drive himself home.

It was only when he pulled into his garage in Newport Richey, Florida that he realized he was unable to pull his body from the vehicle.Â
