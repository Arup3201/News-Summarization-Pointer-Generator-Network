They were once stalwarts of their community - he a high-rolling anesthesiologist, she a world expert on a species of giant waterlilies.

But on Monday, a bedraggled William Styler III, 65, and his wife Nancy, 62, were hauled from their Colorado motel room and arrested for allegedly killing an Aspen socialite and shoving her in closet.

Now friends, attorneys and former colleagues have revealed how illness, debt and lengthy court battles sent the once-successful couple down an apparently ruinous and desperate road.

They are the only suspects in the death of Nancy Pfister, who was found dead four days after she returned from an extended trip to Australia. Before her return, she had complained on Facebook that her tenants - the Stylers - had not paid for $4,000 rent or taken care of her home.

Old life: William Styler, a former physician, and his gardening expert wife Nancy look relaxed as they smile for a photo. The couple have now been accused of murdering a woman in Colorado

Sheriff Joe DiSalvo has not released a
 cause of death or revealed how long the body is believed to have been 
in the closet before it was discovered on February 26.

But
 residents - many of whom had partied with the Stylers at a party 
Pfister threw at her home in November before going away - and Denver 
friends said they were shocked by the arrests.

'They never demonstrated any kind of edge,' Dr. Joel Cooperman, a former neighbor, told the Denver Post. 'Neither of them displayed any kind of behavior that would indicate they would do anything like this.'

'I would laugh to think that that’s what they were involved in. They can't be,' Ned Ingham, a former neighbor, told CBS. 'I am totally floored. It would the last thing I’d ever think.'

Dr
 Styler, known as Trey, was an anesthesiologist and the chairman of St. 
Joseph Hospital's Department of Anesthesiology in the 1990s.

New life: The couple are accused of killing an Aspen socialite whose 
home they were renting. Records have shown the couple have had money 
struggles while William Styler has had health issues

Loss: Nancy Pfister, 57, was found dead last week - four days after she returned from a trip to Australia

The couple, who have a son, lived in 
the Greenwood Village area until about eight years ago, when Styler was 
hit by a chronic illness. He quit his medical practice and his license 
expired in 2005.

Afterwards, he turned his attentions to helping his wife in her full-time gardening career.

She

 founded the Victoria Conservancy and provided lilies to gardening 
entities around the world, becoming known as a leading expert on the 
variety of an 8-foot species called Victoria. They also welcomed school 
children into the garden to look at the flowers and their pond.

'They would have people from all over the world over there,' neighbor Ned Ingham said. 'They were known famously for their flowers.'

A
 photographer, Povy Kendal Atchison, spent time photographing the 
Stylers' gardens and the couple for business shots at the time 'things 
were going south for them'.

Arrest: Styler, a physician, was still in his bathrobe when he was arrested at a motel on Monday afternoon

Caught: The couple were arrested five days after their alleged victim's body was found

She
 told the Denver Post that they seemed like they were good people until 
their money started running out. Court documents reveal the extent of 
their troubles.

In
 2003, Styler had taken his previous company, Colorado Anesthesia 
Consultants, to court in a dispute over software Styler had co-created, 
but he lost the case.

He 
accused his lawyer John Powell, whom he had paid $600,000, for 
overcharging him for legal services - and in 2010, Styler sued Powell 
for the debt, the Aspen Times reported.

He
 won and Powell was put on probation and ordered to pay $800,000. But 
before the Stylers got the money, Powell filed for bankruptcy, 
protecting him from having to pay the 
debt.

The report in the 
Aspen Times says that the scandal led Styler to express suicidal 
thoughts, including telling an attorney that he wanted to commit 
'suicide by cop'.

In court: Nancy Styler is escorted by two deputies to Pitkin County Courthouse on Tuesday

Locked up: Styler, pictured heading to court on Tuesday, and his wife are being held without bond

'It was very devastating to him,' said Paul Gordon, a Denver attorney who represented Styler.

Last summer, Powell complained to the state's Attorney 
Regulation Counsel that Styler was observing his house - and Styler responded that he was trying to find out if Powell still lived there .

As 
recently as November last year, Styler had written to the 
court’s Attorney Regulation Counsel about his frustrations in collecting
 money - the same time he was renting the property from 
Pfister.

When she returned from Australia and 
evicted the couple nearly two weeks ago, they had been staying at the 
Aspenalt Lodge in Basalt, where rooms cost $119 per night.

On Monday, William Styler was taken 
from the motel still wearing his bathrobe, while his wife was seen with 
tears streaming down her face.

Missed: Pfister, pictured right with her daughter, wrote on Facebook that she was returning early from Australia as she was having trouble with tenants who were not paying the rent or bills

Heartbroken: Pfister's daughter Juliana said that had to be something more to her mother's death

They appeared in court on Tuesday - 
William Styler in a wheelchair - where they were ordered to be held 
without bond. They will next appear in court on March 17.

Well-connected: Nancy Pfister was once briefly engaged to actor Michael Douglas

Nancy Pfister's remains were cremated on Monday and relatives and residents are holding a memorial service for her on March 15.

Her murder - the first in Pitkin County, Colorado in more than a decade - has rocked the small ski resort town, where residents said Pfister had been a popular, well-connected resident.

'She'd been one of the golden girls of Aspen, seriously into the party scene [in her youth],' a source told Page Six. 'She hung out with the Kennedys, Jack Nicholson, Cher, Michael Douglas.'

The source added that Pfister was even once briefly engaged to Douglas.

Pfister's
 daughter has said she refuses to accept her mother could have been 
killed over a tenant dispute - and apparently further evidence that the 
couple had money troubles.

'How
 could someone just be so angry that they got kicked out of a house? 
There’s got to be something more. It's hard to understand that', her 
daughter Juliana asked, ABC News reported.

Her daughter Juliana added that her mother had been a beloved member of the community.

'I
 have no idea how someone could do something like that and especially to
 her and I think that, you know, my mom could never hurt anything or 
hurt anyone and that is one thing that everyone that knew her knew,' 
Pfister said. 'She cared about a lot of people and helped the wrong 
people this time.'

Scene: Pfister was found dead in her home, pictured, which she had rented to the Stylers while she traveled

The Aspen Times reported
 that Pfister was the daughter of Art and Betty Pfister, a prominent 
local couple who played a major role in the development of the ski 
resorts. Both preceded their daughter in death.

The
 Stylers, who are believed to have one adult son, were first questioned 
by investigators the day after Pfister's body was found and on Monday 
they were taken to the Pitkin County Jail.

Public
 records show that Mr Styler is a physician who graduated from the 
Oklahoma State University College Of Osteopathic Medicine in 1979, but 
his credentials expired in 2005.
