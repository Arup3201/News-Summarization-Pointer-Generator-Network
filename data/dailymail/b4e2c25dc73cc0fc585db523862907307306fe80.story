Another major championship, another frustrating disappointment for Tiger Woods, not to mention his worst 72-hole score since he turned professional in 1996.

With a round of 4-over-par 74, Woods came in with a 13-over 293 total, a shot higher than his previous worst week, a 12-over at the 2003 PGA Championship.

In other words, apart from the three times as a pro he missed a cut in a major championship, Woods never as bad as this.

Perhaps the comments made by his currently girlfriend Lindsay Vonn didn't help his concentration?

Tiger tamed? Tiger Woods, pictured on Sunday at the U.S. Open at Merion Golf Club in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, might be surprised to hear that girlfriend Lindsay Vonn compared herself to his wife

The apparent slip of the tongue might
surprise Woods, not to mention his recent ex-wife Elin Nordegren, as 
Vonn and Woods have been dating just three months.

The 28-year-old Olympic skier has 
become something of a fixture on the golfing circuit as she has been 
pictured keeping a close eye on Tiger at various courses.

During a quiet moment at Merion Golf 
Club in Ardmore, Pennsylvania on Friday, Ms Vonn said that she didn't 
give the champion golfer advice about his game but she told the New York Times: 'We talk golf after his golf rounds, but mostly I listen. We really are
normal in that way. Lots of people go home and talk to their wife or 
husband about their job. That’s what we do.'

There'll be lots to discuss when the two of them go home.

His tie for 32nd place was his worst finish as a pro at the U.S. Open.

Exasperated: Woods reacts after missing a putt during the second round of the 2013 U.S. Open

'There's always a lesson to be 
learned in every tournament whether you win or lose,' Woods said. 'I'll 
look back at the things I did right and the things I did wrong.'

The No. 1-ranked player in the world never broke par at the U.S. Open, with four rounds in the 70s.

Woods, who has not won a major since 
the 2008 Open in San Diego, had little doubt as to why he played so 
poorly this week on a course many thought was ideally suited for his 
game.

It was all about the putting, he grumbled afterwards.

'I struggled with the speed all week,' Woods said. 'These greens are grainy. I struggled with the speed right around the hole.'

Woods missed too many fairways and took too many putts, a simple yet realistic way to look at his week.

Just two days ago, Woods was four shots out of the lead.

Then, he went 76-74 for his worst weekend in a major championship.

Woods has now gone five years without
winning a major championship, his last coming at the 2008 U.S. Open, 
the 14th of his career.

He will now try to regroup for the British Open at Muirfield in a month.

Champion: Vonn was keen to point out at the golf tournament that she was successful in her own right with her career as an Olympic skier

Ms
Vonn was more of a casual presence on the sidelines than at previous 
competitions. The
Olympic skier has been dressed casually in a T-shirt, jeans, 
sunglasses and baseball cap from her sponsor Red Bull as she closely 
tracked Woods around the course.

She
tweeted on Thursday: 'Day one here we go!' before posting several 
pictures of golf fans' muddy feet at the rain-sodden course.

She also told the Times:
'Some people seem to forget that I’m not just Tiger’s girlfriend. I’m 
actually a successful athlete. I’m Lindsey. I have my own career and my 
own life.'

She added that 
she was 'very happy' and that despite the constant attention that has 
come with dating the world's most famous golfer, the relationship is 
'worth it'.

The 
four-time World Champion skier is currently in training for the 2014 
Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. She has been recovering from an injury
to her left knee which happened during a downhill event in Schlamding, 
Austria in February.

In terms of the rest of the tournament, Justin Rose ended a 43-year English drought by winning the U.S. Open and the sentimental and crowd favourite Phil Mickelson celebrated his birthday with a second-place finish.Five times a runner-up in this event but never a winner, fate seemed to be shining on Mickelson on his 43rd birthday. 'For me, it's very heartbreaking,' Mickelson said after shooting a skittish 4-over-par 74 in the final round, leaving him two shots behind the winner, England's Justin Rose. 'This week was my best opportunity, I felt, heading into the final round, the way I was playing and the position I was in.'  Nice guys don't always finish last. At the U.S. Open, they keep finishing second.
