Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal has reported that the club's injury nightmare may be over with news that Ashley Young is the only player currently sidelined.

Van Gaal's debut campaign has been one decimated by an alarming number of fitness problems to key players. As a result the 63-year-old has been forced to chop and change his formations.

Ahead of their Premier League clash with Southampton on Sunday, the Dutchman would not be drawn on whether United will sign any other players in January following the capture of Victor Valdes, but did reveal that Young is their only forced absentee.

Young's hamstring injury will keep him out for four weeks and Van Gaal said: 'We only have one injury. Can you believe it?'

Valdes took part in his first official training session as a Manchester United player on Friday, after signing an 18-month deal with the club.

Also in action was Daley Blind, who has been out since November with a knee injury, and Marcos Rojo, as Van Gaal oversaw his side's preparations ahead of the visit of Southampton to Old Trafford.

Valdes has been training at Carrington for a while as he recovered from a knee injury. And he told the club's official website of his delight at completing a move.

'It is a real honour to sign for Manchester United. I would like to thank Louis van Gaal and the club for allowing me to do my rehabilitation and to train with the team at the Aon Training Complex,' he said.

'From my short time here I can already see this is a very special club. I worked with Louis van Gaal during my time at Barcelona and to have the opportunity to work with him here at Manchester United is a dream come true.'

While Van Gaal believes competition between goalkeepers David de Gea and  Valdes will help to transform  United in to the best team in the world.

Speaking a day after United signed the former Barcelona stopper, Van Gaal challenged him to dislodge Old Trafford number one De Gea from the team.

The United manager said: 'Nobody is happy to be number two. He has to have the ambition to beat De Gea.

'That will be very hard for him but my ambition is to have the best players who can co-operate and make us the best team in the world.'

Despite now vying with De Gea, Valdes was full of praise for his international team-mate.

The 32-year-old, speaking to MUTV, said: 'I think now, at the moment, he [De Gea] is the best goalkeeper in the world.

'His performance every day and in every game shows everybody that his level is very high. He has had a great year and it is very nice. Now I think he is the best goalkeeper in the world.'

On the anticipated rivalry, Valdes added: 'I am here to help everybody. Always in my career, I have played to help my team-mates, to help my coach and to help everybody. I am a part of the team and I am not a problem, I am just a part of the team.'

Manchester United return to Premier League action after beating Yeovil in the FA Cup third round last Sunday.  

Van Gaal's side haven't lost in the league since a 5-3 defeat at Leicester in September, a run of 15 matches, but they have drawn three of their last four, away at Stoke, Tottenham and Aston Villa. 

And Sunday will see Van Gaal face former assistant Ronald Koeman, who worked under the former when he was in charge of Barcelona.

The two sides met last month at St Mary's, where Manchester United prevailed 2-1 thanks to a brace from Robin van Persie.
