Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City have made enquiries for St Etienne teenager Rayan Souici.

The France Under 17 international plays as a defensive midfielder and models himself on Paul Pogba.

And the three Premier League sides look determined to go head to head in a bid to snap up his signature in January.

The 16-year-old said: 'I have a model that I admire every day, it's Paul Pogba.

'Before my matches, I watch videos of him, he really is an exceptional player.' 

Souici reportedly received an offer from Monaco recently but turned them down in order to push through a move to the Premier League.
