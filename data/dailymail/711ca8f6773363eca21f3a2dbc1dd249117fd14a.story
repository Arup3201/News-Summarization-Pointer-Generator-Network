Sex symbol: Gina Lollobrigida has pledged says her former fiance should be jailed for the 'fake' marriage he is said to have orchestrated

Gina Lollobrigida yesterday pledged to have her former fiance jailed for the ‘fake’ marriage he is said to have orchestrated.

In an exclusive interview the legendary actress described Spaniard Javier Rigua as a ‘vulture’ out to get his hands on her £35million fortune.

Miss Lollobrigida, 85, made headlines this week after it emerged she had complained to Italian police that Mr Rigua, 51, had used fake documents to carry out a wedding ceremony ‘by proxy’.

He has insisted the marriage was completely bona fide.

Speaking to the Mail from her villa on the outskirts of Rome, the actress once dubbed ‘the most beautiful woman in the world’ claimed Mr Rigua was waiting for her ‘to die’.

She said: ‘He is not guilty of just one fraud but of many. He is not a nice person. He will pay for what he has done. 

‘I knew nothing about this until I did some research on the internet. He invented a false document to carry out this wedding and now he will pay. I will not rest until he has been brought to justice. He is nothing but a vulture, circling me, sniffing my blood. He married me and was waiting for me to die so he could inherit my possessions.’

Miss Lollobrigida – who starred with Humphrey Bogart, Burt Lancaster and Sean Connery in several films during the 1950s and 60s – revealed that she went to the police with her manager after inviting Mr Rigua to Rome to discuss the situation.

She said: ‘I didn’t go into the full details otherwise he would never have flown over from Spain. I refused to meet with him when he arrived and instead my manager went to a police station with him.

‘I made the complaint to them and the police questioned Javier for several hours before letting him go. The matter is now an international investigation and I want justice. I want him to pay for what he has done. I will see him in court for what he has done.’

In her statement to Italian police, Miss Lollobrigida said her former boyfriend had carried out the 2010 fake ceremony in a Barcelona register office with a woman named Teresa standing in for her.

She said he was able to carry out the wedding because he had obtained the legal right to act on her behalf. However, she claims she was tricked because all the documents were in Spanish.

Miss Lollobrigida said: ‘I found all this out completely by chance. 

‘To think when I first met him I thought he was polite and educated, I even defended him from gossips but now I see that all his good manners were simply superficial.

‘He would escort me to parties and we would be seen at all sorts of events together.

'At the time I was very depressed as I had been the victim of two other frauds so it wasn’t a very pleasant time for me. Javier helped cheer me up and I eventually decided to marry him.

'But then I travelled to New York to see some friends and after talking with them I changed my mind and told him I had decided that I didn’t want to get married anymore. But he obviously went ahead with it and I only discovered it by chance.

‘When this comes to court he and all his accomplices will go to jail. 

‘He has had the help of many others to carry out this fraud. He was just waiting for me to die so he could have everything I own.’

The couple had met at Monte Carlo in the 1980s and they were together for more than 20 years before splitting up. She said: ‘I couldn’t believe it when I read on the internet that I was supposed to have married him. 

‘There were even witnesses at the ceremony.’ The mystery deepened further last night after Mr Rigau’s lawyers disputed her claims and insisted everything was legal and above board.

Teresa Bueyes said it was ‘impossible’ the actress did not realise  she was married to the Spaniard and claimed Miss Lollobrigida had travelled to Barcelona in August 2010 to sign a legal document agreeing to marry Mr Rigau by proxy, adding that it was signed in front of a notary.

She said the marriage, celebrated without the actress present on November 29, 2010, was ‘completely legitimate’ and ‘took place with the full knowledge of both participants’.

She also insisted that Mr Rigau had signed a document rejecting any inheritance from her on her death.

Since retiring from the silver screen Miss Lollobrigida divides her time between Rome and Monte Carlo, making the odd appearance on Italian TV chat shows.
