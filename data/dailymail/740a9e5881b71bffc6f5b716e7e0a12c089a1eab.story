It was a great year for patriotism with both the Olympics and the Diamond Jubilee taking place.

And it would appear the spirit of national pride extended to British cinemas last year as new figures have revealed huge success at the box office for UK films.

Research by the BFI, the UK’s leading film body, released yesterday, showed that British films led the UK box office charts and took 32 per cent of the market.

The sky's the limit: British films like Skyfall and Warhorse topped the box office in 2012

Skyfall starring Daniel Craig was the top grossing film last year, taking £102 million in the box office

Cinema admissions increased by almost one million to 172.5million in the year - the second highest in 10 years.

As a result of this more than £1billion was brought in at box offices across the year.

The top grossing film at the box 
office in 2012, taking £102million, was the latest James Bond outing – 
Skyfall – which is classed as a joint British and American film.

In second place was another 
Anglo-American blockbuster, The Dark Knight Rises, the most recent 
Batman film, which grossed £56million.

Six of the top 20 films were classed 
as jointly British, with Ridley Scott’s Prometheus in ninth place and 
other UK films The Woman in Black, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and 
War Horse making the list. Daniel Radcliffe fronted The Woman in Black 
was the top earning UK independent film, making £21million at the box 
office.

War Horse, directed by Steven Spielberg, was one of the most popular British films of the last year

The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel starring Judi Dench and Bill Nighy was one of six British films to make the top 20

The BFI said British success had come 
through mainstream blockbusters like Skyfall and Prometheus but also 
through the independent sector.

Of the 32 per cent share of cinema 
going for ‘British’ films, the research showed that 22.9 per cent were 
backed by US studios and nine per cent were British independent films.

The report said even though there were
other huge distractions during the year including the Queen’s Diamond 
Jubilee celebrations and the Olympics in London, cinema-going still held
up relatively well.

The Woman in Black, starring Daniel Radcliffe, was the biggest earning UK independent film, bringing in £21million

The BFI, who released the figures, 
said although the early summer marked an ‘unsurprising downturn’ in 
cinema business that some of the weekend box office results during these
periods were among the highest of the year.

It pointed out that during the weekend
of ‘Super Saturday’ at the Olympics, where Britain won three track and 
field gold medals in one night, it was also the sixth highest weekend of
the year for cinema business with films such as Ted and The Dark Knight
Rises on release.

Britain is regarded as the ‘country of
origin’ on a film, or jointly so, if a significant enough part of the 
film, such as filmmakers, crew, studios or locations, are from here.
