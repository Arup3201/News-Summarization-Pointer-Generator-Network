Alistair Darling has effectively been dumped as head of the campaign to keep Scotland in the UK following crisis cross-party talks

Alistair Darling has effectively been dumped as head of the campaign to keep Scotland in the UK following crisis cross-party talks.

Labour’s shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander has been drafted in to reinvigorate the Better Together campaign run by the former Chancellor amid growing concerns about his ‘lacklustre’ performance.

Members of David Cameron’s inner circle are understood to have voiced concern about how Mr Darling is faring against the charismatic Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond.

One source claimed that following discussions over recent weeks between senior Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat figures, it was secretly agreed that while there would be no formal announcement of a change, Mr Alexander should take charge.

Former prime minister Gordon Brown, who fell out so badly with Mr Darling when he ran the Treasury that the two are not thought to be on speaking terms, is now expected to take a more prominent role in the run-up to the September 18 independence referendum.

One source said: ‘Darling has effectively been dumped – hence Gordon Brown re-emerges.’

A recent poll found the pro-independence ‘yes’ campaign, which once trailed by a huge margin, is now just three points behind.

Mr Darling was initially seen as a safe pair of hands who was well-placed to warn Scottish voters of the economic risks of independence, given his experience at the Treasury.

But one Tory source said he had the air of a ‘middlingly competent accountant’ and was not the ‘big figure’ needed to lead the Labour charge against the SNP.

Another source denied Mr Darling had been dumped but confirmed he was being ‘sidelined’.  

In an indication of his newly prominent role, Mr Alexander used a speech in Scotland to highlight his party’s commitment to a ‘new package of powers’ for Holyrood.

He said they would mean ‘more decisions taken here in Scotland, by the people of Scotland, backed up by the strength, stability and security of the United Kingdom’. 

He added: ‘It will give us, as Scots, the best of both worlds; not division and separation but community and collaboration.’ However, the newly prominent role of the shadow foreign secretary in the pro-Union campaign may itself alarm his critics, who point to a dubious campaigning track record.

He ran Mr Brown’s disastrous 2010 election campaign and David Miliband’s unsuccessful bid to replace him as Labour leader.

SNP Member of the Scottish Parliament Stuart McMillan said there was ‘growing support for “yes” and falling support for “no”’.

He added: ‘It’s time for David Cameron to finally show some leadership and agree to a head-to-head debate with the First Minister.’ 

A Better Together spokesman said the suggestion Mr Darling was being ‘dumped’ was ‘absolute tripe with no substance or truth whatsoever.’ 

Another source familiar with the latest discussions confirmed the campaign was being shaken up, but insisted: ‘Reinforcing Darling is not the same as sidelining.

'Alistair is doing an excellent job and Douglas is going to be helping with campaigning and strategy in the final months.’
