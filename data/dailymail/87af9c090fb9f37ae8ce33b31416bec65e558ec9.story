Leicester boss Nigel Pearson has no doubt Leonardo Ulloa can handle the pressure of expectation.

The Argentinian striker became the Foxes' record signing in July after scoring almost a goal every other game for Brighton last season.

Ulloa has no Premier League experience but marked his debut with a well-taken goal as Leicester began life back in the top flight by drawing 2-2 against Everton at the King Power Stadium.

Ulloa harried the Everton defence throughout, and Pearson said of the 28-year-old: 'I think he showed a lot of qualities.

'His strength and his work-rate will probably have surprised a few people. He's a real team player and I think our players have very quickly recognised his strengths.

Goal: Leonardo Ulloa scored on his Premier League debut against Everton

'When you become a club's record signing there is an added pressure that goes with that, but he handles that very well.

'The perception in terms of the value is probably measured differently externally to what I do. I'm very pleased for Leo because he is a focal point in terms of how we play, he's got a good goalscoring record and I'm pleased he's got off the mark.'

Ulloa's goal cancelled out Aiden McGeady's opener less than two minutes after Everton had taken the lead.

The Toffees went back ahead just before half-time through Steven Naismith but Leicester secured a point four minutes from time thanks to substitute Chris Wood.

Wood's goal was made by midfielder Riyad Mahrez, whose trickery caught the eye throughout the match.

Record: Leonardo Ulloa scored almost a goal every other game while at Brighton last season 

The 23-year-old joined Leicester from Le Havre in January and his performances over the second half of last season earned him a spot in Algeria's World Cup squad.

Pearson said: 'When you consider the progression he's had in the last 12 months, it would be very easy to ask too much of somebody like him.

'He's joined us as a relative unknown and been selected for Algeria in the World Cup and now finds himself playing in the Premier League.

'He's a talented boy, there's no doubt about that, but my job is to make sure I protect my players.

'I've got no doubt he can deliver in the Premier League but I also understand where he's at as a young man learning his trade. He's not going to be able to perform miracles week in, week out.'

One frustration for Pearson was a hamstring injury picked up by Danny Drinkwater in the first half.

Draw: Nigel Pearson's side earned a valuable draw with Roberto Martinez's Everton

The Leicester boss was already without new signings Marc Albrighton and Matthew Upson, striker Jamie Vardy and midfielder Matty James because of injury.

'It probably means we will try to add to the squad between now and the end of the window because the numbers game is important,' said Pearson, who is continuing to pursue former Argentina international Esteban Cambiasso.

A shadow was cast over the start of Everton's season by a knee injury to key midfielder Ross Barkley.

The club are still waiting to find out the extent of the damage but manager Roberto Martinez fears he could be missing for months.

Transfer: At £8.75m, the Argentinian striker is Leicester's most expensive transfer ever

The Spaniard was content with how his side responded, bar the lapse of concentration that allowed Wood to earn Leicester a point.

'That's football,' said Martinez of Barkley's absence.

'You're going to get injuries, you're going to get suspensions and what we need to do is make sure we react as a team, and I think we did that.

'I thought Romelu Lukaku to play 90 minutes was phenomenal, he didn't have the right to play 90 minutes and he showed he's going to get fit very quickly, which is something we didn't expect.

'I think everyone contributed. Leighton Baines and Steven Pienaar showed flashes of their very best understanding, the control from Gareth Barry and James McCarthy was back to the level of last season, and Aiden McGeady is a fresh player.

'The back four looked too comfortable, and that was the problem. If I would have been sitting here with a victory, it would have been a great start to the season.'
