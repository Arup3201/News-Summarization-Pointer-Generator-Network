It has been revealed that under existing restrictions on free speech satirical French magazine Charlie Hebdo could not be printed in Australia.

After the massacre at its offices in Paris where 12 people were killed, the publication's cartoons overnight became a symbol of Western liberties worldwide.

However, Human Rights Commissioner Tim Wilson told The Australian the restrictions contained in 18c of the Racial Discrimination Act would 'ensure it would be shut down' in Australia. 

Masses of demonstrators made their way on Sunday from 'Place de la Republique' to 'Place de la Nation' in the Unity Rally in Paris

Mr Wilson blasted those against proposed changes to the 18c Act, who are now suddenly embracing free speech, and warned that words needed to be backed up by definite action. 

If this did not happen it would clearly be hypocritical, he argued.

'The Charlie Hebdo attack is a wake-up call for a lot of people who rhetorically support free speech but when it comes to the nub would choose political advantage over sensible reform,' he said. 

'This is where they have the opportunity to rise to the challenge, like the leaders of Europe are now doing, rather than being held out as hypocrites.'

Over one million people converged in central Paris for the Unity March to show solidarity with the 17 victims of the terrorist attacks

Large pencils with 'JE SUIS CHARLIE' printed on them were carried during Sunday's march to commemorate the 12 people that were killed at the Charlie Hebdo offices  

Although many of the religious-themed cartoons used in the likes of Charlie Hebdo would not contravene the discrimination act, Mr Wilson said that racial stereotyping of Jews and other ethnic groups would create too many legal issues for such a publication to continue in an Australian context.

'18c only covers issues of race and ethnic origin, which would cover some of the material but not all of it,' he told The Australian.

'It would cover Jews and ethnic representations, but it wouldn't cover Muslims and other bits.

'In the end, the legal problems would essentially ensure it would be shut down.'

Mr Wilson believed that there were 'lots of different avenues for reform', but that there were more issues than 'just 18c to be considered'.   

On Sunday more than three million people have taken part in unity marches across France after 17 people died during three days of deadly attacks in Paris.

Up to 1.6m are estimated to have taken to the streets of the French capital. About 2,000 police officers and 1,350 soldiers - including elite marksmen on rooftops - were deployed in the capital to protect participants.

Marchers chanted 'liberte' ('freedom') and 'Charlie', in reference to the Charlie Hebdo magazine. Many thousands of others waved French flags, cheered, and sang the national anthem.
