At 16 years of age, Martin Odegaard is a Real Madrid player and earning a reported £80,000 per week. The boy done good, you might just about say.

What comes next? We hope his undeniable talent bears fruit at Real and he becomes a global great. Theoretically, though, Odegaard could put his feet up and still become a millionaire many, many times over.

Plenty of teen prodigies have come before and failed to live up to the hype. The spotlight proves too much or the ability turns out to have been exaggerated.

Considering Real’s outlay and the esteem Odegaard holds among the likes of Bayern Munich, Liverpool and Arsenal, the signals suggest he will continue his path to glory. As a cautionary tale, however, Sportsmail looks at some of those who fell short of expectations.

Freddy Adu

The ultimate story of unfulfilled promise perhaps. That is not to sound like schadenfreude, simply an assessment of how a dream lost lustre in reality. At 14, Adu was the youngest athlete to sign a professional contract in US sport when drafted by DC United.

He was twice named in the MLS All-Star team and expected to lead his nation at World Cups. Having had a trial with Manchester United, he eventually arrived in Europe at Benfica. That did not go well, nor spells at Monaco, Belenenses, Aris or Caykur Rizespor. His work-rate was questioned and his career bottomed out when struggling Blackpool failed to find cause to give him a deal a year ago.

Now 25, he is without a club having seen a six-month contract with Serbian outfit Jagodina end. He does have nearly 400,000 followers on Twitter, mind.

Cherno Samba

Most famous among computer gamers for being a cast-iron success on Championship Manager, Samba’s real-life exploits were as solid only as mercury. Born in Gambia, he came to England at an early age and performed with such style for Millwall that the club rejected a £2million offer from Liverpool under Gerard Houllier.

He played for every England youth level up to Under 20s, but his talent failed to keep pace with his ego and in 2004 he was released by Millwall, beginning a tour of football’s lesser lights. Time at Cadiz, Plymouth, Wrexham, Haka, Panetolikos and Tonsberg came and went. He did play for Gambia’s senior side, even scoring once, but now aged 29 is unattached.

Nii Lamptey

Probably football’s clearest fable, a byword for the pitfalls that can afflict young talent. Born in Ghana, Lamptey was voted player of the tournament in the 1991 World Youth Cup featuring Argentina's Juan Sebastian Verón and Italy's Alessandro del Piero. Pele hailed Lamptey his natural heir.

Anderlecht brought him to Europe and the Belgian FA changed rules so he could play in the club’s first team aged 16. He got a goal on his European debut and was top scorer in Holland when he moved to PSV Eindhoven.

Ron Atkinson signed him for Aston Villa and Coventry but Lamptey failed to shine as anticipated and his star drifted south. He tried seven different countries to resurrect his career but failed.

'When Pele said I could go on to become like him, it was a great honour for me,' Lamptey has said. ‘But it had its negative side - everywhere I went I was supposed to live up to very high standards. Once I couldn't meet people's expectations, I was considered a failure.'

Sonny Pike on the Fantasy Football League show

Sonny Pike

The nephew of former Tottenham striker Marc Falco hit the headlines aged seven when Ajax plucked him from Leyton Orient’s youth team in the early 90s. Dressed in the kit of the Dutch giants and with long, flowing hair, he took part in a curious segment with David Baddiel and Frank Skinner on their Fantasy Football League show to discuss his ambitions.

But the pressure of top-level football affected him mentally and he required therapy, before quitting the game for good in 2003. He went on to study psychology at Dundee University in pursuit of a ‘normal’ life.

Michael Johnson

More than words, the photograph that emerged in January 2013 of this once cult hero told Johnson’s story. The face podgy, the eyes sad, his picture captured on a night out led to the revelation his £25,000-per-week contract with Manchester City had been cancelled and his career effectively over at 25.

Sven Goran Eriksson said he would be an England star. Others called him the new Colin Bell. Severe injuries which led to a lax physical condition put paid to those hopes. A City academy graduate and local lad, he excited fans during the 2007-08 campaign with two goals in 25 lung-busting displays.

Abdominal and knee injuries curtailed his ‘big talent’ – the words of Roberto Mancini – and he made just four appearances for City in his final five seasons.

Federico Macheda

Introduced himself to the Premier League aged 17 with a stunning goal to win a dramatic game against Aston Villa in the final minute and get Manchester United’s 2008-09 title bid back on track. On the brink of losing a third consecutive match, Macheda sent a curling shot past Brad Friedel.

He scored the winner against Sunderland in his next league match too, setting up his promise – but subsequently failed to make a genuine impact.

Loan spells at Sampdoria, QPR, Stuttgart and Doncaster hardly inspired, before a slight bounce at Birmingham. Now aged 23, he is on Cardiff’s books and looking to build his career.

Savio Nsereko

The one all West Ham followers know well. Signed for £9m in 2009 as the club’s Icelandic owners rolled the dice, Savio arrived with pedigree as a Germany Under 21 international.

But he failed to score in a spell that was curtailed after six months with Fiorentina spending less than a third of the fee West Ham had paid. Karren Brady later investigated the transfer.

Savio never played for the Italians, and flopped at six clubs on loan, ending up at Atyrau in Kazakhstan. In late 2012, he was arrested in the Thai resort of Pattaya on a false kidnap claim, having reportedly attempted to extort money from his family as ransom. Previously, at Juve Stabia, Savio was reported missing after going AWOL from training. Interpol later joined the search.

Savio turned up, but the talent which had convinced West Ham to splash the cash was never found.

Kerlon

The Brazilian made a name for himself at Cruzeiro with his ‘seal dribble’ – nodding the ball with his head while running at opponents. Some found it disrespectful, Inter decided to bring him to Serie A. It did not go to plan. Injuries curtailed his opportunities and set off a nomadic journey, sparked by Jose Mourinho sending him to Ajax. Parana and Nacional followed.

He had a reasonably successful spell with Fujieda – a lowly Japanese team – before moving to Weymouth Wales in Barbados. Still aged just 26, it is not the outpost expected when starring for Brazil’s Under 17s.

Nicklas Bendtner

It may seem harsh to include the Dane on a list of failed prodigies, but given he laid claim to being one of the world’s best strikers from a young age the gauge is set to a higher configuration.

Having made his Asrenal debut aged 17 - a decade ago now – we are still left wondering where the confidence came from to make his bold statement. 

Bendtner joined Wolfsburg on a free after Arsene Wenger tried for numerous seasons to offload a player who was, somehow, on £50,000 per week. 

The numbers show he scored 45 goals in 171 games during his time at Arsenal, hardly elite standard, and then there was the hellraiser attitude – topped when he was arrested for smashing windows in a gym at his luxury apartment complex.

Nicklas Bendtner never lived up to his claim of being one of the world's leading strikers at Arsenal

Anderson

A man whose terrace chant far outweighs his on-field activities. Hailed by United fans as the ‘midfield magician who s**** on Fabregas’ following his early performances in a red shirt – notably at Anfield in December 2007 when Steven Gerrard got the runaround – he now cannot even find a club to sign him.

It looked so special when signed for £20m from Porto aged 19. He scored a penalty full of character in the 2008 Champions League final shootout against Chelsea.

But an alleged fondness for fast food has led to fitness problems and he will leave Old Trafford this summer, at the latest, having never redeemed the adulation.
