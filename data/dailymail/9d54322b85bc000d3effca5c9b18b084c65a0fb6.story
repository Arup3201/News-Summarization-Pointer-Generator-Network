Britons were today preparing for the return of dry weather over the coming week after flooding brought parts of the country to a halt over the weekend.

Warm
 sunny spells were seen today with temperatures reacing 27C 
(81F) on the south coast, but isolated thunderstorms will hit the South East later.

The hottest coastal locations in England this week are forecast to include Southampton, Portsmouth, Brighton and Newhaven - all on the south coast.

Also said to be among the best coastal spots over the next few days are Bridport in Dorset, and Burnham-on-Sea and Weston-super-Mare in Somerset.

Yesterday, homes in the South East were flooded after heavy rain, with people stranded in vehicles, roads blocked and properties damaged by lightning.

Essex firefighters said houses were 
affected in Canvey Island and resources were stretched as crews went to 
incidents in Southend, Harlow and Ongar.

Trains
 were cancelled after flooding near Billericay, while Southend 
Hospital’s accident and emergency department was temporarily shut due to
 flooding.

The Lambeth Country Show at Brockwell Park in Brixton, south London, was abandoned after torrential rain.

But weather experts say the weekend’s torrential rain has now largely passed, with hot, dry weather to come.

The
 Environment Agency has removed 30 flood alerts in the last 24 hours. 
Some 22 flood alerts still remain, the majority in the South East.

And
 there are two more serious flood warnings in East Anglia, as agency 
staff monitor river levels, though these are expected to fall.

'Tombstoning': Local residents in Bridlington estimate that the men are jumping from a height of 30ft into water that is only between 6ft and 10ft deep

Three-day forecast: Weather experts say the weekend's torrential rain has now largely passed, with hot, dry weather to come

Warnings: The Environment Agency has removed 30 flood alerts in the last 24 hours. Some 22 flood alerts still remain, the majority in the South East

The Met Office has also removed the 
severe weather warnings it had in place over the weekend, with dry 
weather expected in most parts today.

Temperatures are likely to soar again later in the week, with the mercury possibly topping 30C (86F).

But
 the heat is again likely to bring with it the risk of heavy showers and
 thunderstorms, especially in the South, on Wednesday and Thursday.

Laura Caldwell, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, said: ‘It is going to be warm, quite hot even, in places through the week.

‘Pretty much everywhere across the UK will see above average temperatures, with peaks of 30C (86F) on Thursday and Friday.

‘Hopefully for the first day or two of the week it shouldn’t be too unsettled, with dry and fine weather in most places.

Beautiful start: The dawn breaks at Carn Marth in Cornwall this morning as more fine weather is forecast for the week

The week begins: Another view of sunrise at Carn Marth, near Redruth, in Cornwall, with more warm weather forecast to be on the way

Fish: Paul Masters lost an estimated £40,000 of Koi Carp in Canvey Island, Essex, after sewage backed up and ran into his koi pond and swimming pool

Problems: Floodwater on the streets of Canvey Island, Essex. Water reportedly up to 10in deep poured into some properties at the peak but began to subside quickly

Flooding: Essex firefighters said houses were affected in Canvey Island and resources were stretched as crews went to incidents in Southend (pictured) and Harlow

‘But as we get to Wednesday and into Thursday there is a chance of some heavy and thundery showers breaking out in south and south-western parts.

‘On Thursday [there] could be widespread thunder storms, as we saw over the weekend, though it is hard to say whether they will be as intense.’

Last week the country was struck by more than 100,000 lightning bolts in only 72 hours - enough to provide power for Birmingham and Manchester.

After peaking at a sweltering 32.3C (90F), the mercury fell slightly last night as fresh winds blew the ‘Spanish plume’ of hot air out to the North Sea.

Anyone who has been suffering from sleepless nights in the past few days will be glad to hear that night-time temperatures will be coming down this week.

While the mercury went up to 21C (70F) overnight on Friday, tonight it is unlikely to rise higher than 11C (52F) anywhere in the country.

And temperatures are expected to hover around a pleasant 26C (79F) today, before slowly creeping up through the rest of the week.

Barn owls: The iconic bird has seen its population tumble in recent decades, with some estimates putting numbers at fewer than 4,000 in Britain

Barn owls have staged a strong comeback thanks to the glorious weather, after their numbers slumped alarmingly following last year’s poor summer.

This year, experts are celebrating record numbers of eggs and chicks in nests which are monitored through the breeding season.

The iconic bird has seen its population tumble in recent decades, with some estimates putting numbers at fewer than 4,000 in Britain.

But this summer’s excellent breeding rates are raising hopes that the barn owls have turned a corner and the population will climb.

John Dellow, of Berkshire monitoring group the Newbury Ornithological Society, said: ‘What a difference a year makes.

‘There was a good year in 2012 when surveys concluded that 72 barn owl chicks fledged from the boxes that were monitored by our group.

‘But this was followed by a disastrous year in 2013 when no breeding was found at all, even though the number of boxes was approximately unchanged at 120.’

He added: ‘Morale in the group was at an all-time low and there were mutterings that it would take a decade for the barn owl population to recover.

‘But the 2013-14 winter was exceptionally mild and this enabled short-tailed voles, one of their main prey, to start breeding exceptionally early.

‘At the time of writing, 118 chicks had been found, by far a record for the group... It is clear we are seeing a remarkable exhibition of the resilience of nature.’

Barn owls have also been breeding in record numbers in the Dedham Vale and Stour Valley in Suffolk following a disastrous year for them last year.

Today: Low cloud and mist in some eastern areas at first. Slowly brightening up, although staying locally dull and cool on some eastern coasts into the afternoon. Elsewhere, generally dry with sunny periods but isolated afternoon showers in the east. Warm.

Tonight: Any showers in the east dying away this evening, then generally dry with clear periods overnight. Low cloud again returning to some eastern areas and also affecting some western coasts.

Tuesday: Early cloud breaking up with most places having a dry day with sunny periods and occasional cloudier spells. A few rogue showers may develop in the north and west. Warm.

Wednesday to Friday: Plenty of dry and fine weather with sunny periods. Some showers in the south and west from Thursday these locally heavy and thundery. Very warm, locally hot in the south.

Friday to Sunday: There is likely to be plenty of fine and dry weather around, especially across the northern half of the UK. More showery conditions generally affecting southern parts, which potentially could be heavy and thundery at times. Temperatures remaining warm or very warm for many across the UK and perhaps locally hot in places. Sea breezes could keep some coastal parts a little fresher though.

Monday, July 28 to Sunday, August 3, 2014: Currently there are signs of Atlantic frontal systems moving in from the west, bringing spells of more persistent rain, mainly to northwestern parts, interspersed with brighter, but showery conditions. Whilst probably drier and warmer in the south. Temperatures also gradually returning to near or a little above normal.

Monday, August 4 to Monday, August 18, 2014: At the start of the period, the favoured scenario is for northern and western parts to be affected by spells of rain at times whilst southern, eastern and central regions have the best chance of more prolonged fine weather, though even here some rain or showers are possible. With time, it looks likely that all areas will turn generally more unsettled although there will still be some drier and brighter spells. Despite this, there is a signal for temperatures remaining warm, with some muggy nights to come. Towards the end of the period, the weather looks likely to become more settled again with some dry, fine and sunny conditions. It also looks likely to be warm, especially in the north and east.
