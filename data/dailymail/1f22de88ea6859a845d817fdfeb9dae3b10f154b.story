A former Chelsea academy footballer and lifelong supporter of the London club has died after being hit by taxi.

Joe Reay, who played in the same Chelsea youth side as sprinter Adam Gemili, was struck by the car on Saturday evening and pronounced dead at the scene.

After leaving his boyhood club, the 20-year-old moved to Conference Premier side Woking FC where his father is a director.

Upon hearing the news, the club released a statement, saying: 'It is with great sadness that Woking Football Club has today learned of the untimely passing of Joe Reay, son of Director Kelvin Reay.

'The club offers its deepest condolences to the Reay family at this difficult time. Joe was a respected member of Woking's Academy.'

Tributes have since poured in for Reay. 

Gemili tweeted: 'Gutted to hear about a former team mate who died yesterday. R.I.P. Joe Reay. My thoughts are with his family.' 

Chelsea also took to social media to say: 'All at Chelsea FC are saddened by the death of former Academy player Joe Reay last weekend. Our thoughts are with his family and friends.'
