A Tudor mansion which was painstaking dismantled brick by brick and moved more than seventy miles by an eccentric landowner before being rebuilt has been put on sale for £14 million.

Cedar Court - rumoured to be the one-time home of Henry VIII's sixth wife Catherine Parr - was built on the banks of the River Colne, near Chelmsford, in the 15th century where it was home to a wealthy salt merchant, before becoming a public house. 

But in 1910, wealthy antiquarian Walter Thornton-Smith was so taken with its by now dilapidated charms that he ordered for it to be uprooted and transported piece by piece to Kingston-on-Thames, Surrey, and put back together again to restore it to its former glory.

He spent £30,000 - about £1 million in today's money - moving the 12 bedroom, nine bathroom house originally built in 1483, to a piece of land he had purchased near Coombe Hill golf course.
