A Marine veteran jailed in a dangerous area of Mexico for carrying a gun across the border was expected to be released today, his lawyer said.

The Mexican attorney general's office told U.S. Senator Bill Nelson about the pending release after Nelson's office got word from the mother of Jon Hammar.

'No American should be in a Mexican jail for five months without being able to have his case in front of a judge,' Senator Nelson said. 'We're grateful, this is a good Christmas present.'

Hammar's attorney Eddie Varon Levy said he was flying on Friday from Mexico City to Matamoros to pick his client up.

After that, the attorney said they 
intended to fly to Brownsville, Texas, later in the day. 'I'm very 
happy. I feel that the Mexican legal system came out the way it should 
have,' he said.

A defense lawyer said it was 
determined there was no intent to commit a crime. A  U.S. Consulate 
official said they are standing by to escort the former Marine safely 
back to the United States as soon as they get official word of a 
release.

Nelson was among a handful of local 
elected officials who urged the State Department to help get Hammar out 
of Mexico. His family said he was being held in isolation after they 
received threats to his safety.

Civilian gun ownership is illegal 
under Mexican law unless the owner purchases the weapon from a special 
shop run by the country's Department of Defense.

'The Department of State warns all 
U.S. citizens against taking any type of firearm or ammunition into 
Mexico,' according to the website of the U.S. Embassy in Mexico.

'Entering Mexico with a firearm, 
certain types of knives, or even a single round of ammunition is 
illegal, even if the weapon or ammunition is taken into Mexico 
unintentionally.'

Mexican law also bans shotguns with barrels of less than 25 inches. The family said Hammar's shotgun has a barrel of 24 inches.

Tourists are allowed to bring guns 
for hunting on rare occasions, but Mexican officials said all visitors 
must receive a special permit before entering the country.

Mexican 
customs agents do not issue gun permits. As a result, anyone crossing 
the border with a firearm or ammunition without a previously issued 
government permit is in instant violation of Mexican law, which 
stipulates long jail terms for breaking weapons laws.

Hammar and his friend were on their 
way to Costa Rica in August and planned to drive across the Mexican 
border near Matamoros in a Winnebago filled with surfboards and camping 
gear. Hammar, 27, asked U.S. border agents what to do with the unloaded 
shotgun.

His family said agents told them to fill out a form for the gun, which belonged to Hammar's great-grandfather.

But when the pair crossed the border 
and handed the paperwork to Mexican officials, they impounded the RV and
 jailed the men, saying it was illegal to carry that type of gun. 
Hammar's friend was later released because the gun did not belong to 
him.

Varon Levy said he was not sure of Hammar's immediate plans once he returns to the U.S. 'Probably some down time,' he said.

Hero: Hammar was a combat veteran who had been treated for PTSD just before his arrest in Mexico

A photo of Marine Veteran Jon
 Hammar, held captive in one of Mexico’s most infamous prisons for four 
months, showed him in a solitary cell inside Matamoros state prison in Tamaulipas, shirtless, barefoot and chained by handcuffs around his right ankle.

He was photographed sitting on an thin mattress with a red blanket in a room with chipped walls and a squalid floor. He does not appear to have any visible injuries.

The email containing the photo was sent anonymously to Hammar's mother from a Yahoo.mx account.

Hammar served in Iraq and Afghanistan before being honorably discharged from the Marines in 2007.

His mother said surfing helped him cope after he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

Hammar developed PTSD following the death of a fellow Marine who was killed by a sniper's bullet 
when the two served together in Fallujah, Iraq.

He had just completed 
treatment at a center for veterans in California last year, 
before getting detained during his misadventure in Matamoros.
