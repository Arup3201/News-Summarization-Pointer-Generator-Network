Roy Keane's second autobiography was always going to be a read that opened up old wounds, unsettling former team-mates and managers alike. 

It didn't disappoint. The former Manchester United captain had Sir Alex Ferguson, the Class of '92 and Carlos Quieroz in his sights - among a raft of others - but also contextualised various moments of a controversial career.

Here, Sportsmail takes a look at the highlights of The Second Half - released this Thursday.

The Class of '92

All good players but their role at the club has been exaggerated.

The Class of ’92 seems to have grown its own legs. It has become a brand. It’s as if they were a team away from a team and they are not shy of plugging in to it.

Paul Scholes

Scholesy was a top top player but I still don’t fall for the boy next door image. Or that he’s dead humble. He has more of an edge to him. Everyone thinks he lives in a council flat.

Fighting Peter Schmeichel 

I had a bust-up with Peter when we were on a preseason tour of Asia, in 1998, just after I came back from my cruciate injury. I think we were in Hong Kong. There was drink involved. There'd been a little bit of tension between us over the years, for football reasons.

There was a lot of noise - Peter's a big lad. I woke up the next morning. I kind of vaguely remembered the fight. My hand was really sore and one of my fingers was bent backwards.

Peter had grabbed me, I'd headbutted him. We'd been fighting for ages.

Leaving Old Trafford

It was another little hand grenade they threw at me. Not an hour later, or two hours, or after the severance negotiations - it was already written. I said to Ferguson “Can I play for somebody else?” And he said, “Yeah you can, cos we’re tearing up your contract” 

So I thought, “All right - I’ll get fixed up”. I knew there’d be clubs in for me when the news got out. I said, “Yeah - I think we have come to the end”. I just thought, “F****** p****” and I stood up and went “Yeah. I’m off”. 

That MUTV interview

It was getting a bit silly so I got the players together in the dressing room and told them it was f*****g nonsense.

'They were all going: ‘Yeah, Yeah’. Not one of them had an issue. Not one.

Sir Alex Ferguson vs Brian Clough 

I put Brian Clough ahead of Alex Ferguson. I think with Sir Alex Ferguson it was pure business - everything is business. If he was being nice I would think: “This is business, this”. He was driven and ruthless. That lack of warmth was his strength.

Carlos Quieroz questioning his loyalty

Don’t you f****** talk to me about loyalty, Carlos. You left this club after 12 months a few years ago for the Real Madrid job.

Manchester United's downturn

I look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better. Not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best.

Looking at what happened to David Moyes, I can only conclude that he didn’t have a strong dressing room. He had a weak dressing room.

Feud with Ferguson

Keane reveals he said to Ferguson: ‘You as well gaffer. We need f****** more from you. We need a bit more, gaffer. We’re slipping behind other teams.'

Alf-Inge Haaland 

I did want to nail him and let him know what was happening. I wanted to hurt him and stand over him and go: 'Take that, you c--t.' I don't regret that. But I had no wish to injure him. 

Rio Ferdinand

He suffered for it and so did the team. If it had been me, and the doctor had said I had to do a drugs test, I'd have gone and done it. It wasn't something I'd have forgotten. 

Almost moving to Real Madrid

Michael [Kennedy - his agent] had given me a heads-up that Emilio Butragueno would be phoning, so I took my mobile phone everywhere with me. 

And - how's your luck - he rang me while I was sitting on the toilet.

He said: "Look Roy, we'll be glad to have you." The club's board just had to sanction the deal. 

In hindsight, I should have said to myself: 'Go, go to Spain, live there for a year and a half, learn the language, learn the culture
