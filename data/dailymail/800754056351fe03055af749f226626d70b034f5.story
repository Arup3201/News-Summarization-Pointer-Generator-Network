Everton boss Roberto Martinez has revealed midfielder Ross Barkley could be out of action for up to five months after he suffered a knee ligament injury in training.

The Toffees originally thought they would be without their star midfielder for six to eight weeks, however it now appears as if Barkley's injury is worse than first feared. 

Martinez, speaking after his side's 2-2 draw with Leicester, said on Barkley's injury: 'He had a scan but it was a bit difficult to determine the extent. With the swelling we don't really know how bad the injury is.

Blow: The England international was hurt during a session at the club's Finch Farm training ground on Friday

'We know it's a partial tear but that could be anything between seven weeks and I've seen injuries like that that take four or five months.

'Ross Barkley is a phenomenal footballer and we're going to miss him, there's no doubt about it. He was so sharp in pre-season, I thought he came back with a different approach.

'He was very unfortunate to (sustain the injury) through an innocuous challenge in training and now he's going to be out for a long, long time.

'The squad should be big enough to be able to cope with losing a player and be able to perform well, but it's a disappointing moment when Ross Barkley was going to have a really big start to the season.

'Now it's coping with the frustration and allowing him to come back when he's fully fit and ready for whatever's left in the season.'

Barkley was hurt during training at the club's Finch Farm headquarters on Friday and was seen leaving with his leg in a supportive brace. 

Martinez has revealed the England international is  extremely disappointed after yet another injury setback.
