A teenager nearly died after the car she was driving hit a pothole, catapulting her 20ft through a fence and into a ditch.

Christie Councer was driving to college when she lost control of her Ford Ka and ended up crashing into a tree before her car came to a stop in a hedge.

The 19-year-old hairdressing apprentice is calling on Gloucestershire County Counil to fill in the  holes to prevent future accidents.

Christie Councer, 19, was left with glass embedded in her face and head after her car hit a pothole, catapulting her 20ft into a ditch before she hit a tree and came to rest in a hedge

Miss Councer's Ford Ka was written off in the accident caused by a pothole

She was left with fragments of glass embedded in her head and face as well as concussion after the accident, which happened on January 27.

The teen, from Stroud in Gloucestershire, said her car hit two potholes, measuring around 40cm by 10cm, while driving along the A4173 in Gloucester.

The car was written off, leaving Miss Councer having to pay £500 for a new vehicle.

She said: 'I was on my way to college at about 10am.

'I hit a pothole when I was doing about 35 or 40mph - which is well under the recommended speed limit there.

'I lost control of the car. I didn't know what to do so I ended up on the other side of the road.

'Then I went through a fence and into a tree. I would have gone further but I went into a hedge which stopped me.

'At some point during all of this my air bags deployed, I'm not sure when though.

'I was really scared. I looked for my phone to call 999 but I couldn't find it and I started to panic.

'Then some men came running up to me and helped get me out my car and called 999.

'I was taken to hospital where they had to give me some really strong pain killers.

'They also had to give me some aesthetic so they could pull all the glass out my face.'

Miss Councer has now launched an appeal for all of the potholes in the area to be filled in to prevent the same thing happening to other drivers.

She said: 'The only thing that was there to warn about them was white paint around the outside, but the paint had been there so long it was starting to fade.

'There should have been something there to warn drivers.

Miss Councer, who has since recovered from her injuries, recalled the accident. She said: 'I was really scared. I looked for my phone to call 999 but I couldn't find it and I started to panic'

The teenager, who was forced to spend £500 on a new car, called for Gloucestershire County Council to repair the potholes. A spokesman for the council said the holes have been filled as part of routine inspections made across the county's road network

'When it's such a dangerous and busy road there needs to be some kind of warning.

'At night it's impossible to see them, there needs to be a sign or something.

'After my accident my sister saw another Ford Ka lose control after hitting a pothole on a different road.

'It's going to keep happening until the council do something.

'It shouldn't take people getting hurt before the council are prepared to do anything.'

The teenager braved the roads for the first time today, getting back behind the wheel of her car, adding the incident could have been a 'lot worse'.

A spokesman for Gloucestershire County Council said: 'Our sympathies are with the driver involved in this accident.

'We inspect our busiest roads every month as a matter of course, fixing the worst potholes immediately and repairing others within 28 days – in line with national guidelines.

'Potholes on this stretch of road have now been fixed as part of these routine repairs and we will continue to monitor the road closely.'

When Frank Cattrall damaged his car driving over a pothole, he decided that the council should foot the repair bill.

But rather than admit fault, officials said they knew nothing of the hole and said his poor driving must have been to blame.

They dismissed the 62-year-old grandfather’s claim that they should pay the £500 bill to fix the wrecked suspension on his Renault Espace.

But Mr Cattrall suspected he was being fobbed off and resolved to find out whether the council was telling him the truth.

Using
 a Freedom of Information request, he found out that a council worker 
had reported the 18in by 6in hole during an inspection three months 
earlier – but the council had ignored it.

The hole was even recorded as a priority case that should be repaired within 28 days, but it was never fixed.

He thought that this evidence should be enough to force the council to soften its stance.

But
 even after Mr Cattrall, a retired BT project manager, told Essex County
 Council of his findings, it still refused to pay up – and the 
disagreement went to the small claims court.

At
 a hearing at Colchester County Court, a judge ruled in favour of Mr 
Cattrall and ordered the council to refund him £500, plus costs of £115.

‘I
 think the council works on the basis that a lot of drivers will just 
throw their hands up in despair at all the obstacles which are put in 
their way and just forget about it as people just don’t want the 
hassle,’ he said.

‘I have 
had phone calls and texts saying “well done” since I won the court case 
and hopefully more people will now do the same.’
