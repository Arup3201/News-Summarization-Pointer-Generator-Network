It's all about a more delicate take on flower power this summer, if Dorothy Perkins' latest collection is anything to go by.

The high street store, which is part of Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group, has unveiled its latest floral-filled collection, All About Rose.

The fun and feminine new range draws is full of pretty dresses, on-trend pleated skirts, soft tailoring and cool separates.

Flower power: The floral trend shows no sign of abating this season. In fact, Dorothy Perkins has used the English rose to inspire its new collection, All About Rose (Pink rose button back shell top, £26, Rose print midi skirt, £30, Metallic strappy heel, £32)

The range aims to mix textures and prints and encapsulates the omnipresent floral trend with roses and flower detailing in jacquard, lace, appliqué and embroidery - so very Marchesa.

As the name suggests, the 16-piece collection is full of rose prints, which aims to add a feminine and romantic aesthetic that works for every summer occasion, from BBQs to weddings.

'Building 
on our British heritage as we fast approach our centenary, All About 
Rose by Dorothy Perkins is a collection that takes a romanticised stance
 on florals for summer and uses blush and candy colours mixed with 
cornflower blues to create a pastel hue,' said a spokesperson for the 
store.

Highlights
 include the pale pink boyfriend jacket, which will look great thrown 
over a summery white dress, Burberry-esque rose jacquard pencil skirt 
and matching structured top, as well as the pink appliqué floral cropped blouse and wide leg trousers.

There is also the All About Rose jewellery collection, which uses the romantic floral insignias in mixed metals.

Pretty pastels: Dorothy Perkins has incorporated the floral trend into the range using rose applique - very Marchesa and Burberry (Pink 3D rose top, £35, White crepe shorts, £20)

Something for everyone: The store say they've created an outfit for every occasion, from maxis ideal for weddings (left: Rose strappy maxi £45), to more casual looks, perfect for a summer BBQ (right: rose motif tee, £15,  Rose print palazzo, £35)

On-trend: The SS14 catwalks were awash with pretty pastels, especially that candyfloss pink hue, and it seems Dorothy Perkins took note (Rose jacquard sweat, £24, Pleat front wide leg trouser, £22)

Necklaces, rings and bracelets have all been worked using differing 
floral shapes in pretty pastels with added sparkle to add some glamour 
to any outfit.

Speaking about the range, Toni Jones, editor of 30ishstylist.com, said: 'Delicate but still grown-up, this collection is pretty without being overly girlie. This means it’s a nice way to wear the pastel or floral trend without looking like you have raided your daughter’s wardrobe.

'Lots of the separates are smart enough to wear to the office teamed with a sharp shirt or skirt so they are hard-working too.

'My picks are the pale pink shell top with three quarter length sleeves, which will look awesome with boyfriend jeans and heels on a night out, and the pleated skirt which will work with a denim or chambray shirt for a stylish weekend look.'

Pretty in pink: The store say the All About Rose is a collection that takes a romanticised stance on florals for summer and uses blush and candy colours mixed with cornflower blues to create a pastel hue (Rose jacquard pep hem dress, £25, Flower Bunch Ring, £5)

All white: The range is also full of clean lined white shorts and light jackets, perfect for hazy summer nights (left: Rose motif tee, £15, White crepe shorts, £20, and, right, Ivory crepe jacket, £45, 3D rose shrug, £45)
