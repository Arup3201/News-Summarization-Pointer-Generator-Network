An undercover investigation in China has revealed the disgusting conditions in which a wildly popular snack known as 'Spicy Sticks' are made.

The food - made from flour, spicy oil and food additives - is especially popular among young adults and children due to their cheap cost, but reports in the media of them causing extreme sickness have prompted concern.

The snacks are popular among Chinese people living abroad, with thousands of people ordering them via online marketplaces such as Amazon - and there was even an online campaign recently to promote the red sticks among Westerners.

Unhygienic: One worker had blistered fingers due to the chemicals, the undercover investigation found

Hands on: Very few workers wore protective gloves in making the Spicy Sticks

In China they sell for just 10p a pack and are a common sight in primary school tuck shops.

The most popular brands sell more than 400,000 packets a month, solely online.

But many consumers have reported suffering from severe sickness and diarrhoea after eating them, and one three-year-old girl was reportedly left with festering sores around her mouth after gorging on the snack.

People's Daily Online reported that, during secret, filming at one of the many firms which produce the snack, investigators found one worker handling food with a finger that had blistered through exposure to the chemicals used in the process - without wearing protective gloves.

At the factory in Tongxu County, Henan Province, an undercover reporter saw workers visit dirty lavatories and return to work without washing their hands - again without wearing gloves or face masks when handling food.

The finished product was also packed with bare hands, with workers' hands stained by the red oil that coats the food - leading at least one woman to suffer sores on her finger.

When challenged as to why they weren't wearing gloves, staff said they slowed down their work.

Boxes used to store the snacks were also seen covered in an oil-like substance, while a choking smell filled the entire site.

Close to the production line were various boilers, pipes and a large metal drum filled with a reddish liquid that emitted a strange smell as well as a small bucket that was full of black sludge.

The manufacturer, Kaifeng Jinsong Food Co, shared the premises with other businesses and there was evidence of paint particles spreading into the Spicy Stick workshop from a toymakers next door.

It comes after a toddler in the city of Jiujiang was hospitalised with severe sores and ulcers which were caused by eating too many of the sticks, reports People's Daily Online.

And one blogger claimed he suffered five hours of diarrhoea after eating 10 of the sticks in quick succession to test their effect.

Campiagn: Chinese fans of the snack have been encouraging Westerners to try it and posting their comments online

Many consumers who have bought the snack online have also left comments reporting similar symptoms. 

Chinese fans of the snack had recently started an online campaign to make it popular with Westerners.

A site showing pictures of Western workers in China eating the sticks - known in Mandarin as 'Latiao' - alongside their thoughts on them, gained a large following.

Among the comments on the site were 'latiao is taking over the world' and 'We've found the weapon that will defeat America'.

But the campaign that included plans to formally export the spicy snack abroad ended this week as quickly as it started, after the images of the manufacturing process emerged.

Chinese media have reported several scares in the past in which the snack had been accused of being unhealthy and even causing cancer.

The authorities claim they are working to crack down on breaches of hygiene and safety regulations among food producers.

According to the latest report by China Food and Drug Administration, there were 15 brands of Spicy Stick on the banned foods list because they exceeded acceptable levels of acid, bacteria or other chemicals.

In 2011, 53 manufacturers of the snack were ordered to shut down by the Beijing Food Safety Committee, but critics claim many firms continued to operate illegally under new aliases.

A manager claiming to be in charge at Kaifeng Jinsong Food Co told the undercover reporter: 'We are checked regularly by the authorities and there are areas that we fail on. If you are talking about washing hands, changing clothes before going to the toilet... then the workers will find this very constricting and it will be difficult to recruit for this work.'
