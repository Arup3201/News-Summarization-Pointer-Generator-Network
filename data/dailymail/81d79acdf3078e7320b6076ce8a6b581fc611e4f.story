A Brisbane mother has been charged with child cruelty after police allegedly found her two young sons covered in faeces in their squalid home after she had left them alone overnight.

The 20-year-old woman appeared in Brisbane Magistrates Court on Tuesday charged with child cruelty and leaving her boys, aged two and four, unattended without making provision for their care on May 3 and 4.

Police allegedly found faeces smeared on walls, a dead possum in the outdoor play area, rubbish and soiled nappies strewn across the floor and said the children's bedroom had an 'overpowering' bad smell when they searched the Keperra home in northwest Brisbane.

Police went to the home for a welfare check on May 3 after a neighbour reported seeing the mother come home in a taxi at 10am, dressed as if she had been out all night, The Courier-Mail reported.

Police say the four-year-old son answered the door and allege he smelt of urine. Officers asked for his mother and he went back inside the home.

When the 20-year-old woman came to the door she allegedly scolded the boy shouting: 'You do not open the door to anyone … you don't even open the door for police.'

The woman told police her children had been watched overnight by her mother and sister but police allege her claim was found to be untrue.

The next day police responded to another call from a neighbour who reported seeing the 2-year-old boy banging his head against a window.

Police say the four-year-old again answered the door wearing a nappy 'full of faeces'.

The woman was found asleep in her bedroom. She was arrested and charged and child protection detectives attended the home.

The mother received bail on Tuesday and will face court again next month.
