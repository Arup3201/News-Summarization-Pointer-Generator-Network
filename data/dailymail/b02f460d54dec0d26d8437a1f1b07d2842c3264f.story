New footage of the shameful scenes during the pitch invasion at Villa Park on Saturday appears to show two West Bromwich Albion involved in clashes with supporters entering the pitch.

Villa face a major FA inquiry, a substantial fine and the threat of a ground closure after  players looked to have been assaulted as the FA Cup quarter-final at Villa Park descended into chaos with an unrestrained pitch invasion joined by thousands of Villa fans.

Scorer Fabian Delph claimed he was bitten, while Boaz Myhill, Craig Dawson, James Morrison and Callum McManaman all appeared to be barged aggressively - and the new footage shows the latter two in altercations with the on-rushing fans.

Three men have been charged by police  with offences connected to the match after officers made a total of 17 arrests inside and outside Villa Park.

More footage discovered on Monday appeared to show West Brom fans setting off fire extinguishers and throwing bins in the away end at Villa Park.

The Black Country club are working with police to identify supporters seen in the video.
