A mother-of-two was left horrified after she found what she claims is a 'wriggling worm’ in a burger as she sat down for a family BBQ.

Anna Seth-Smith, 44, was preparing for dinner during a holiday in Helston, Cornwall, when she cut into the quarter pounder - and the suspected parasite fell out.

The primary school purchased the burger from a Sainsbury's near the Skyburriowe Farm campsite - but the supermarket giants insist the object is not a tapeworm and has sent the creature for tests.

Wriggling:
 The mother was handing the burger to her daughter at the Skyburriowe 
Farm campsite when she noticed the 'worm' - and immediately contacted 
Cornwall Council's Environmental Health Department

Disgusted: Anna Seth-Smith, 44, was enjoying a BBQ with her daughter Elena, seven (left), partner Jon Heath (right) and 15-month-old son Atticus (front) in Helston, Cornwall, when the suspected parasite fell out

Mrs Seth-Smith made the shocking discovery as she was handing the food to her seven-year-old daughter Elena.

Mrs Seth-Smith reported the case to the department of Environmental Health at Cornwall Council the following morning who collected the burger and have now taken it for analysis.

Sainsbury’s have apologised to the family but insist the 'object' was not a tapeworm.

Mrs Seth-Smith - who was with her partner Jon Heath, Elena and her son Atticus, 15 months, at the time - said: 'I had prepared a really lovely green salad and we were just getting ready to eat.

'We got one of the burgers off the BBQ and put one on a plate to check it was cooked and before we knew it something appeared out of the meat.

'We just starred at it in shock. It just wriggled and wriggled and then died. We are just horrified. I was going to give it to my daughter, imagine that. It makes me feel sick just thinking about it.'

Shocked: Mrs Seth-Smith, from London, quickly threw the other three burgers away in disgust

The shocked couple quickly threw the other three burgers away.

Anna added: 'I just feel appalled - what if the whole batch is contaminated and people have already bought them and haven’t eaten them and they are just sitting in their fridge?

'It definitely put us off our food and I have gone off burgers completely. I guess it is one of those urban legends. People talk about it happening, but as you don’t know of anyone who it is happened to you just assume it isn’t really a problem.

'I never would have imagined it would happen to us.'

Sainsbury’s said: ‘As the Environmental Health Officer has confirmed, this was not a worm of any kind but a small part of the meat used to make the burgers. Any suggestion that there was a worm in this product is false.

'We’d like to apologise to Mrs Seth-Smith for her experience.'

Anna said she will report the incident to supermarket once she has been given the results from Environmental Health.

Response: Sainbury's have apologised to the family, but insist the 'object' is not a tapeworm
