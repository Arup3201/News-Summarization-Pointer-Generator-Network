A woman suffering a fatal aneurysm at a Taco Bell drive thru was robbed of her belongings - including her wedding ring - by thieves as she lay dying, police have said.

Danielle Zimmerman, 43, went to the restaurant in Wichita, Kansas on Sunday night to collect dinner for her family when she suffered the brain aneurysm and smashed into the speaker box.

The thief, who has not been found, apparently had just moments to steal her purse, iPhone and ring from her finger as passersby and emergency crews arrived to help her.

'Instead of trying to help her, somebody robbed her,' her distraught husband of 21 years, Kris, told the Wichita Eagle.

'What really appalled me - the wedding ring. How could you take somebodyâ€™s wedding ring off their finger?'

After the crash, about nine people gathered around the car and found her unconscious. Her husband said that he had heard a hospital worker from nearby was trying to help her.

Her husband believes that one of the people there must have seen the theft and now he hopes someone will 'stand up
 and do the right thing'.

Wichita police said that they have no suspects in the theft and asked anyone with information about the stolen property call Crime Stoppers, at 316-267-2111.

Local pawn shops have also been advised of what the ring looks like in case it is brought to them. The family said it does not care about recovering her cash or phone - they just want the ring.

'We would like to get the ring back more than anything,' Mrs Zimmerman's cousin told KWCH.

'I would like to say some things to the people that did this... but more than anything, I want there to be some kind of closure for Kris and her boys.'

The purse, including photos of her two teenage sons, has been found by children sledding near to the Taco Bell. The thief took $150 and credit cards from inside.

Mr Zimmerman was watching football and waiting for his wife to return home with dinner, which they were to share with one of their sons, 13, and his friend.

After 30 minutes, he called her to no answer, and 15 minutes later, he decided to go and find her. But as he was leaving his driveway, police arrived and told him his wife was in the hospital.

There, a chaplain told him that she 
had suffered a serious aneurysm - although she had never had one before -
 and that she had blood on her brain.

It was also at the hospital that he learned all of his wife's belongings were missing.

On Monday, her family made the decision to switch off her life support. Her organs were prepared for donation.

Mr Zimmerman said he is still in shock that he lost his wife so young in what he called a 'fluke of nature'.

'She was easy-going, fun,' he said. 'We could finish each otherâ€™s thought. We were just the perfect match really. And she was a great mother and great wife.'

Mrs Zimmerman leaves behind two sons, Noah, 13, and Alex, 18.
