An elderly man decorating a relative's grave for Easter has been killed after the headstone fell on him.

Stephan Woytack, 74, from Scranton, Pennsylvania, was struck in the head by the memorial on Monday at Saint Joseph's Cemetery in nearby Throop on Monday.

He and his wife were attaching an ornament when it toppled, trapping him underneath.

Scene: Stephan Woytack, 74, from Scranton, Pennsylvania, was struck in the head Monday at Saint Joseph's Cemetery in nearby Throop on Monday while standing with his wife 

A cemetery caretaker told WNEP-TV the couple visits the grave several times a year and ties a cross to it.

Caretaker Ed Kubilus says the bases of headstones often sink when the ground thaws, making them susceptible to tipping over. 

He said: 'They tie a cross to it every year, the both of them. And after they’re done tying the cross to it, they stand there, say prayers, and then they leave.' 

Bishop Joseph C. Bambera from the Dioceses of Scranton told The Times Tribune: 'It is unimaginable to think that a visit of a faithful couple to the grave of loved ones in anticipation of the celebration of Easter could have ended in such a tragic manner.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with the deceased and his family.' 

Police and representatives from the coroner's office were on the scene for hours before moving the man's body.
