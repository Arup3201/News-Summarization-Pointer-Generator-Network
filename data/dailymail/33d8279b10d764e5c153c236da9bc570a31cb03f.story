It's not every woman approaching her century who can claim to have two big sisters to look up to.

Yet that is the proud boast of 97-year-old Mary Hunt.

She, Hilda Greening, 107, and Jean Underwood, 104, have an astonishing combined age of 308. Each has outlived her husband and between them they have 12 children, 17 grandchildren and 29 great grandchildren.

Hilda Greening was born in 1904 while Edward VII was on the throne.

Together with her sisters Jean Underwood, 104, and Mary Hunt, 97, she has witnessed a century of incredible social and technological change.

The siblings have lived through two world wars and the reigns of five monarchs, and seen off 19 prime ministers.

Universal suffrage was not granted until 1928, 51 years before Margaret Thatcher became Britain's first female PM.

They have experienced the spread of electric lights and gas cookers into the average home, and seen the arrival of television, home computers and the Internet.

Many of the extended family were on 
hand to help Mrs Greening celebrate her 107th birthday a fortnight ago 
at a nursing home in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire.

Her daughter Elizabeth Sallis, who is
74 and herself a great grandmother of eight, said: ‘We’re not exactly 
sure how they’ve lived so well for so long – it must be in the genes.

‘They worked as housemaids for years and have all had very interesting lives.

‘Mum is in remarkably good health for
107. She doesn’t take any medication apart from paracetamol for her 
arthritis. Auntie Mary comes every Monday to see mum and that keeps her 
ticking over.’

For her birthday, Mrs Greening 
received a new dress from Mrs Sallis, countless bunches of flowers and a
message from the Queen – her eighth.

‘She was chuffed with her card from the Queen this year as she is wearing a different dress in the picture,’ said Mrs Sallis.

The daughters of farm labourer Harry 
Wasley and his wife Julia, the sisters grew up in a one- bedroom cottage
in Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, and all left school in their early 
teens to go into service.

Hilda married her childhood sweetheart Cyril Greening in 1931 and they were together for 45 years up to his death aged 84.

Jean married Arthur Underwood in 
1940. The couple worked at stately homes, with Arthur as a groom and 
Jean as a cleaner, and had two daughters.

Jean is now in a residential home in 
Charmouth, Dorset, after suffering a stroke. Mary lives in Twyning, 
Gloucestershire, and had five children with husband William, a gardener.

The sisters’ mother and father lived to 85 and 89 respectively.

Mrs Sallis said that Hilda, Jean and Mary have always been close and have fond memories of working as housemaids.

‘Mum tells us lots of different 
stories about what it was like then. She worked really, really hard. She
went to work as a housemaid after leaving school at 13 and had 
chilblains from her fingers to her elbows.

‘There were three cottages in a row 
and they lived in the middle one. When Auntie Jean was a child she 
didn’t realise they were moving.

‘There were no removal vans and they 
just had to carry everything round, but it was fine because they had 
moved into one of the cottages next door.

‘They were absolutely thrilled because it was a two-bedroom house and they had been living in a one-bedroom before.’

Mrs Greening added: ‘We had about 30 
bob (£1.50) a week to live off and although that got better as time went
on there was never anything left over. But when times were hard we were
lucky to have family and friends around us.’

Mrs Greening was ten when the First 
World War broke out. She said: ‘I used to go to my grandmother’s, which 
was just around the corner.

‘I asked what the lights were that were shining up at the sky around us.

‘She never told me they were looking for German Zeppelins, because she knew it would scare me.’
