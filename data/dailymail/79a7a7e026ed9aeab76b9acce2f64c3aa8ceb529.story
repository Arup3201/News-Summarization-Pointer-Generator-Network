She has walked some of the biggest catwalks in the world, is rumoured to be the new face of Chanel and has a net worth of a cool £1.9million.

We're talking about Kendall Jenner, who, if the recent state of her career is anything to go by, looks set to usurp Cara Delevingne as the world's biggest supermodel in 2015.

Kendall's career has been going from strength to strength over the last twelve months.

Friends in competition: Cara and Kendall are close friends but in recent months it seems Kendall has been taking over Cara's career as top model 

Having initially found fame on the hit TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians, which follows the life of her glamorous family, she has been at great pains to move into the fashion world.  

And her hard work has been paying off. Not only did she recently land her first big beauty campaign for Estee Lauder, but it's also thought that  Karl Lagerfeld is eyeing her for his latest project.

The Chanel head honcho has reportedly asked the reality TV star to feature in the ad for his Spring/Summer 2015 collection alongside fellow models Sasha Luss, Ming Xi and Baptiste Giabiconi.

This is despite the fact that 22-year-old London born Cara has long been his muse.

The recent models.com list of the top 50 models in the world also seemed to confirm that Kendall is  overtaking in the high fashion stakes.

The list, which ranks models according to how many campaigns, front covers and followers they have, didn't even feature Ms Delevingne, but Kendall made the cut for the first time.

It probably doesn't hurt that the second youngest of the Kardashian clan has a cool 33 million Instagram followers - the equivalent of over half the population of the UK. 

Of course, Kendall's success comes at a time when Cara has very openly decided to let her modelling work take a back seat.

Over the last few months, she has started to carve a career as an actress and musician and previously described the idea of giving up modelling as, 'blissful.'

She starred in the recent Amanda Knox biopic, Face of An Angel, and is currently working on a film named Paper Towns. 

Kendall - who recently earned a 13 page spread in the December issue of Vogue - is very much enamoured with the fashion industry though, claiming that she has worked had to get where she is today. 

In a recent interview, she said: 'I’m not trying to use a family name or anything. In reality I worked pretty hard for this… It wasn’t like I just got it magically and it just happened.' 

Moving with the times: Estee Lauder have named Kendall as their new face and asked her to announce the news via her social media accounts

She continued: 'I would always be looking at these supermodels, they were just so amazing to me, they were like superheroes. 

'I want to be some little girl's superhero. I want to be the best role model I can be to a little girl or a little boy or to anybody.' 

Her popularity within the fashion industry is clear. Earlier this year she starred in Givenchy's A/W 2014 campaign, which was shot by renowned photographers Mert and Marcus.

And over the last two seasons she has been booked for show after show. 

When she walked the Marc Jacobs A/W 2014 runway, she made headlines all over the world in a daring nipple-baring top.

LOVE magazine editor Katie Grand - who has championed Kendall in her publication - said of the decision to cast the young star, 'When we are casting Marc Jacobs, I always try and throw in a couple of unexpected models. 

'When Kendall Jenner's agent, Christopher Michael, called me and asked me to meet Kendall, I was intrigued.'

It's a family affair: Kendall first found fame in Keeping Up With Kardashians, which follows the lives of her and her sisters. Here she is pictured with Khloe and Kylie at the American Music Awards last week

There are even many similarities between the two young women, just like Cara, Kendall runs with the in crowd. 

From hanging out with her uber famous sisters; Kim, Khloe, Kourtney and Kylie, to kicking back with some of the most famous stars on the planet.

Kendall is not only close friends with Justin Bieber, she's also been spotted hanging out with Selena Gomez and Jaden Smith.

And from December of 2013 to February 2014 she dated one of the world's most eligible bachelors, Harry Styles.

Being seen with the One Direction heartthrob provided an incredible boost to her fan base.

Although Kendall might not have been modelling for as long as Cara, she's already bringing in the big bucks. 

While Cara landed herself on the list of Forbes list of the highest earning models earlier this year for her £2.2million fortune, with a net worth of £1.9million Kendall isn't trailing far behind. 

Plus, a leaked email from one of the Kardashian clan's assistants recently suggesting that Kendall charges anywhere up to £630,000 per endorsement, so she's not even going to have to work that hard to catch up. 

However, if Kendall does manage to knock Cara off the top model spot, there won't be any bad blood between them.

The pair have been seen hanging out on more than one occasion, even dressing up together for Halloween this year.
