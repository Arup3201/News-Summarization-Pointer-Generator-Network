Charged: Detective Chief Inspector April Casburn, 53, is accused of misconduct in public office

One of Scotland Yard’s most senior counter-terrorism officers was last night charged with offering to leak information to the News of the World.

Detective Chief Inspector April Casburn, 53, is accused of misconduct in public office by contacting the defunct Sunday tabloid before the hacking scandal exploded.

She became the first person to be charged under Operation Elveden, the controversial inquiry into the bribing of public officials for information.

It is not known if any information was exchanged.

Casburn is the former head of the secretive National Terrorist Financial Investigation Unit which supports some of the most sensitive police inquiries.

She was arrested by colleagues from her own force last December during a dawn swoop at her home in Chelmsford, Essex.

Her desk on one of the top floors of the Metropolitan Police’s towering Empress State Building base in West London was also searched.

The decision to prosecute her is a landmark moment in the progress of the multi-million pound anti-corruption inquiry.

A total of 50 people, including journalists and public officials from police officers to prison guards, have been arrested and questioned.

Among them were senior staff from The Sun and the News of the World where a committee set up by parent company News Corp has handed millions of emails to police.

Alison Levitt QC, of the Crown Prosection Service, said there is ‘sufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of conviction’.

She said: ‘This charge relates to an allegation that DCI Casburn contacted the News of the World newspaper and offered to provide information.’

Casburn worked in the financial sector before embarking on a career with City of London Police and the Met, including several roles leading fraud squads.

She held senior posts in the boroughs of Hackney and Redbridge before moving to Scotland Yard’s elite specialist operations wing.

The branch includes counter terrorism operations, security at Parliament and airports as well as Royal, diplomatic and VIP protection units.

In her role she has mixed with top Government officials from the Office of Security and Counter Terrorism who work behind the scenes to disrupt terrorist financing.

Several years ago she attended a prestigious post-graduate course at Cambridge University for police officers from around the world.

She has also spoken about her work at the National Terrorist Financial Investigation Unit on the security and police conference circuit.

Operation Elveden is running alongside the huge phone-hacking inquiry, Operation Weeting, and a third probe into computer hacking.

Casburn will appear before magistrates on October 1.
