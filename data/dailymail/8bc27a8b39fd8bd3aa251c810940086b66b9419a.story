Jimmy Walker defended his Sony Open crown in style at the Waialae Country Club on Sunday as he finished with a massive nine-shot margin over the rest of the field.

The 36-year-old, who lost out in a playoff at the Hyundai Tournament of Champions in Maui last week, was in determined mood as he carded a seven-under 63 to claim his fourth PGA Tour title.

After a fine 62 on Saturday he had an overnight lead of two shots, but this increased to six as a hat-trick of birdies on the eighth, ninth and 10th holes took him to 19 under.

It would have been easy for Walker to relax a little at that point, safe in the knowledge no-one was going to catch him, but he racked up four more birdies, including a smooth 20-foot putt on the 12th hole.

Walker, who finished on 23 under, highlighted how last week's near miss was in his thinking as he refused to let up and recorded the biggest victory in Sony Open history.

'It's quite a bit different (to last week). I really wanted to try to finish out the day today like I kind of didn't do last week and it was really fun,' he told Sky Sports 4.

'The wind picked up this afternoon, it was tough, it played tough, and I just kept grinding, having good shots, putts and that's what I wanted to do today.'

The American, who picked up two and a half points in his Ryder Cup debut last year, explained that his recent improvements are down to his growing confidence.

'Just more confidence, more comfortable,' he added. 'I've got good people, I've got a great trainer and a good coach, a great wife and kids. Things are good.'

Scott Piercy notched a second 66 in two days to rise six places into a distant second, while Matt Kuchar's streak of 255 consecutive rounds with a birdie ended on Sunday.

Kuchar, who had shared the lead going into the third day, finished with a one-over 71 as he drifted out to T3 alongside Gary Woodland and Harris English.

Englishman Brian Davis joined a six-strong group a shot further back on 12 under as he hit four birdies and a bogey on his way to a fourth round 67.

Davis was in good company as Justin Thomas, who equalled the course record with a nine-under 61 on Friday, was also at T6.
