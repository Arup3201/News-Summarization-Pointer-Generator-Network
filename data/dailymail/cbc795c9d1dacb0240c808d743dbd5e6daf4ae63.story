Toulon's Delon Armitage has appealed against a 12-week ban for abusive language directed at Leicester Tigers supporters after a European Rugby Champions Cup match on December 7, European Professional Cup Rugby has announced.

An independent disciplinary committee found that Armitage had directed abusive language at Leicester supporters after the match at Welford Road, which Leicester won 25-21, and was therefore guilty of misconduct.

The appeal will be heard in London on January 8, 2015 by an independent appeal committee consisting of Lorne Crerar (Scotland), chairman, Rod McKenzie (Scotland) and Simon Thomas (Wales).

The disciplinary committee said Armitage's previous record was taken into account when they made their judgement on December 21.

The panel released their full judgment on December 21 and revealed that Armitage, who pleaded not guilty, admitted to twice telling Leicester supporters to ‘f*** off’ after the defeat in the East Midlands.

'We considered the player's previous record and concluded that he is an habitual offender against the laws of the game, and one for whom there needs to be a deterrent to combat a clear pattern of offending, both on and off the field,' read the judgement.

'The player is without doubt an exceptionally talented individual, but he has an appalling disciplinary record, both on and off the field.'
