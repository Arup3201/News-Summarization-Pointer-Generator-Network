A judge ruled yesterday that one of the Muslim fanatics who killed Fusilier Lee Rigby has no defence to the charge of murder.

Mr Justice Sweeney said nothing Michael Adebolajo, 29, had offered in evidence about killing the 25-year-old soldier ‘amounts in law to a defence’.

The judge told the jury to ignore Adebolajo’s claim that he is ‘a soldier of Allah’ who is ‘justified in doing what he did’.

Victim: The alleged murderers of Lee Rigby cut his throat because it was 'humane' and carried it out because they were 'at war', a court has heard

Adebolajo has repeatedly told the Old 
Bailey that the killing near Woolwich Barracks in South East London on 
May 22 was an act of war aimed at changing British foreign policy in 
Muslim countries.

Michael Adebowale, 22, his co-defendant, has refused to take the stand and no other evidence has been offered on his behalf.

The case continues to be heard because the onus is on the prosecution to prove the guilt of the defendants.

Jurors returned to court yesterday for the closing speeches in the case from prosecution and defence barristers.

Message to jury: Justice Sweeney (pictured) told the court: 'I have ruled that nothing he [Adebolajo] said in evidence, such as he was a soldier of Allah, amounts to a law to a defence to this count'

In
 his closing speech, Richard Whittam, QC, prosecuting, said the 
‘barbarous’ actions of the defendants were ‘indefensible in the law of 
this country’, but added: ‘Islam, one of the world’s great religions, is
 not on trial and nor can it be.’

Adebolajo’s
 barrister David Gottlieb suggested in his closing speech that his 
client was obeying a command from God and did not form the intention for
 murder.

Adebolajo has told the court he loved Al Qaeda and wanted to change British foreign policy by killing the 25 year-old Fusilier.

He added: 'I am a soldier. This is war.'

The judge also told the jury they did not have to reach a verdict on the second charge of conspiracy to murder as this was dealt with by the attempted murder charges.

He added: 'Neither side will suffer any disadvantage as a result of its removal so for good reason I am going to discharge you from any further consideration of count two and it will play no part in my directions of law to you in due course.'

Drummer Rigby's family were again there to hear the evidence.

Beginning his closing speech, prosecutor Richard Whittam QC said that after he was run over, according to Adebolajo: 'Lee Rigby was slain by a mujahideen who struck his neck with a sharp instrument and sawed until his head almost became detached.

Shocking: This is the Vauxhall Tigra that was used during the killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby which was shown in court during the trial of Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22

Evidence:
 This giant knife was found on the passenger seat of the vehicle that 
ploughed into Drummer Rigby at 40mph on May 22. It was not used in the 
killing 

'That is how he viewed the first part of his actions. It will be for you to decide the evidence in this case and to consider his acceptance that both he and his co-defendant are responsible for killing Lee Rigby.

Testimony: Michael Adebolajo said he loved Al Qaeda and said its members were his 'brothers'

'He denies murder and he does not accept the barbarous reality of what they did and the intimidation of the public and all those present.'

Mr Rigby, a father-of-one from Middleton, Rochdale, Lancashire, was a member of the Corps of Drums in the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Regiment.

He was knocked over by a Vauxhall Tigra driven by Adebolajo and Adebowale as he crossed the road near Woolwich Barracks in south London on 22 May this year.

Adebolajo then attempted to decapitate the soldier while Adebowale stabbed him in the torso before the pair dragged his mutilated body into the middle of the road.

Both men were shot by armed police at the scene.

Recounting the events of May 22 and the prosecution's case, Mr Whittam showed the jury once again images of bloodied knives, and also replayed the video clip in which Fusilier Rigby is seen being hit by a Vauxhall Tigra.

'What was the consequence of driving into Lee Rigby?' asked Mr Whittam. 'The consequence was it broke his back.'

Replaying a video clip showing Fusilier Rigby being dragged into the road, Mr Whittam said: 'Is this a humane killing?

Background: Adebolajo, 28, pictured in a police interview, was brought up as a Christian but became a Muslim when a student at Greenwich University

'Is this a killing with an attempt to decapitate and then deposit the body in the middle of the road causing traffic to stop and turn around?'

Mr Whittam recalled witness accounts previously read to the jury as well as extracts from a note handed to Amanda Donnelly-Martin at the scene.

'You will have to consider if that's a suicide note,' he said. 'Note that it contains the phrase "If I live beyond this day".

'What was the purpose of what they have done, killing Lee Rigby in the way the had done, in putting the body there and staying at the scene?

'To borrow a phrase from the first defendant - carnage.'

Mr Whittam turned to the charge of attempted murder of a police officer and described the defendants' actions when police arrived at the scene.

He told the jury not to be 'seduced by suggestions that the sole objective was to commit suicide'.

Describing Adebolajo's movement, the prosecutor said: 'He had a meat cleaver, a weapon that needed to have direct contact. He raised the weapon above his head and got very close to the vehicle.'

Describing Adebowale's movement, he said: 'Did he run straight at the vehicle to be caught? He ran along the wall. Why? To draw fire.'

Whittam said: 'What these two men did, crashing their car and breaking the back of Lee Rigby and then killing him is indefensible in the law of this country.'

He went on: 'Killing to make a political point, to frighten the public, to put pressure on the Government or as an expression of anger is murder and remains murder whether the government in question is a good one, a bad one, or a dreadful one.'

'Brutal': The two men accused of the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby, Michael Adebolajo (right) and Michael Adebowale (second right) hacked at Lee Rigby like 'he was a tree', witnesses said

David Gottlieb, for Adebolajo, quoted from a poem by First World War poet Edmund Blunden, called Report On Experience, and told the jury that religion had been a 'red herring' in the case.

He went on: 'All deaths outside of lawful deaths are cruel, needless and unnecessary.

'Do you think really that this is the cruellest, most sadistic, most callous, most cowardly killing that's ever occurred in our nation's history? It isn't.'

Mr Gottlieb suggested that rather than murder, the proper charge for Adebolajo would have been 'treason, terrorism, or maybe manslaughter' - but later corrected himself by telling the jury that this has no legal basis as a defence.

The defending barrister also suggested that Adebolajo was 'the most law-abiding terrorist in the history of this country' as his client paid for a parking ticket moments before the alleged murder took place.

Mr Gottlieb told the jury that they 'genuinely have a choice' to acquit his client, and that they will be under pressure 'from outside, from the mob, from the world, to convict'.

Turning to the attempted murder charge, he said it is 'possibly the most ridiculous charge ever put before a judge and jury in the history of this country'.

Mr Gottlieb told the jury that there were unarmed police near the scene, but Adebolajo chose to wait for armed teams, which would not fit with an intention to kill an officer.

He had also underlined passages about martyrdom in documents found by police.

The barrister went on to tell the panel of eight women and four men that the issue of what motivated Adebolajo 'raises awkward questions' for the UK's political leaders.

He said: 'A person, a human being, can do the most evil act in the world and not actually be evil themselves.'

The barrister went on: 'All I'm asking on behalf of my client is that you try this case according to the same standards that you would for anybody else.'

Adebowale, also known as Ismail Ibn Abdullah, of Greenwich, and Adebolajo, also known as Mujaahid Abu Hamza, of Lewisham, both deny murder and attempted murder of police officers.

The trial was adjourned to tomorrow.
