Sampdoria striker Samuel Eto'o has revealed he was the victim of racism during his time at Chelsea.

The Blues have been in the spotlight recently after five supporters were ordered to appear in court over an alleged racist incident on the Paris Metro.

A Paris Saint-Germain fan appeared to be prevented from boarding a train before his side took on Chelsea in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 clash.

Five men will appear at Waltham Forest Magistrates' Court on March 25 in connection with the incident in Paris. 

Eto'o spent last season at Stamford Bridge and scored nine goals in 21 Premier League appearances, but has revealed there was one unpleasant event during his time in west London.

'I went to go buy a watch at a jewellers, not too far from my house,' he told CNN. 'The watch I wanted to see was expensive. And I asked the saleswoman - who was also black - "Could you show me that watch please?"

'I saw her turn to her co-workers like, "Uh, what should I do?" Eventually, she let me see the watch. I looked at it and said, "OK, I’ll buy it." I took out my credit card and when she went to go run it through the machine, she came back and said that it was declined. I asked her, "Was it declined or did you not want it to be accepted?"

'My brother asked, "What’s going on?" and she said, "Nothing, nothing." but he said, "No, because when I came in, I saw how all of you were looking at us."

'My brother told them, "My brother can afford this and the way you’re treating him shows that you think just because he’s black, he can’t afford this watch."

'The woman then slipped up and said, "No, it’s just that we had some Nigerians in the store the other day who came in with fake credit cards."

'I don’t know if you can imagine the weight of what she said. If one of my own makes a mistake, they judge us all. I don’t think she’s a racist person, but she stereotyped all black people as 'those people.''
