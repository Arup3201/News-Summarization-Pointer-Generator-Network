Ashley Cole landed in Italy on Monday
 ahead of joining Serie A side Roma and has agreed to a huge pay-cut to 
join the Italian giants.

It
 is understood the left-back, who was released by Chelsea, has agreed a 
two-year deal worth a basic £1.8million per season (around £35,000 a week), though the contract 
is believed to be loaded with incentive-based wage increments. There is 
also an option for a third season.

It represents a huge decrease in his Chelsea wages — where he earned in the region of £200,000 a week — and even if he plays regularly for Roma this figure would only be £80,000.

Cole, who retired from international football earlier this year following his omission from England’s World Cup squad, had a medical ahead of signing the contract.

The former Arsenal defender was greeted by around 50 supporters as he arrived at Rome’s Fiumicino airport before heading to the club’s Trigoria training HQ.

Cole was dubbed 'Cashley' after he left the Gunners in 2006 over wage demands over a
 new contract, when he was offered £55,000 instead of his desired 
£60,000 per week. He then moved to Chelsea for more money in a part 
exchange deal for William Gallas plus £5m.

'When I heard my agent
 repeat the figure of £55,000 [per week], I nearly swerved off the 
road,' he famously recalled in his autobiography of the time he heard of
 Arsenal's new offer for him while he was driving his car.

Cole’s move to Italy ends his 17-year 
career in the Barclays Premier League, in which time he has won every 
major domestic and European club competition.

The 33-year-old lost his place to 
Cesar Azpilicueta, who is a right-back by trade, last season and was 
forced to spend the majority of the campaign sitting on the bench.

His
 lack of games ultimately cost him a place in Roy Hodgson’s plans for 
Brazil 2014 as left-backs Leighton Baines and Luke Shaw were preferred 
by the England manager.

Liverpool
 manager Brendan Rodgers had shown an interest in signing Cole, as did 
Real Madrid, who are managed by the defender’s former Chelsea manager 
Carlo Ancelotti.

Roma 
manager Rudi Garcia is also keen to sign former Chelsea striker Samuel 
Eto’o following his release from Stamford Bridge and talks with the 
Cameroon international are planned for later this week.
