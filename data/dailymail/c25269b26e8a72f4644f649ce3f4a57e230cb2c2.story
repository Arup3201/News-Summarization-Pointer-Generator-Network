Injuries: Jodie O'Donohoe, now aged 10, with permanent scars after face burns which her mother says were contributed to by head lice shampoo

The mother of a little girl who suffered appalling burns to her face believes a lice shampoo she was using contributed to the fire that caused the injuries.

Nichola O’Donohoe has set up a Facebook page called Justice For Jodie in tribute to her now 10-year-old daughter’s bravery.

And despite the fact that the accident occurred more than six years ago, Jodie is still receiving treatment for the burns.

Her mother, Nichola, 44, said she had used the lice shampoo Prioderm and believes this may have contributed to the fire.

Jodie’s father, Phil, 45, had put the treatment on both Jodie and her sister Jasmine, 12, after they caught head lice off their friends.

But the manufacturers of the shampoo, Reckitt Benckiser, claim that there are no safety issues with the product if the instructions are followed.

Mrs O’Donohoe said she had lit a candle with Jodie earlier on that day and said the flame was ‘nearly out’ and not powerful enough to cause damage.

She was out at the time of the accident, and said: ‘Phil wouldn’t tell me what happened but I could hear Jodie screaming – I never expected what I was about to walk into.

‘I rushed home and there was a horrible stench of smoke and Jodie’s hair was all over the floor and then I knew. It was horrific.

‘Her face was burnt all over – her eyebrows, eyelashes, nose, ears, lips and the top of her head. It was terrible. She was shivering and had gone into shock. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.’

The County Tipperary, Ireland, schoolgirl has suffered tremendously since the accident, according to her family.

Seriously injured: Jodie O'Donohoe was treated in hospital for six weeks following the incident which saw her suffer horrific burns

Her father, a carer for an Autism charity, tried to put the fire out but when he was unable to he put Jodie’s head under running water.

Mrs O’Donohoe said: ‘I was in hell, absolute hell. I felt like I had been picked up and thrown head first into a blender.

'Jodie was only seconds away from burning everything on her face. Any longer and she would have lost her eyes, her whole face would have been gone.’

Jodie was treated in hospital for six weeks and was heavily sedated while she received treatment.

The family say they were told by doctors the burns would not heal and skin grafts were the only option.

‘They took the skin from her head so they had to shave her hair off. It was horrible. This was my little baby girl.

'She was such a beautiful girl people would swoon over her. She was absolutely perfect.’

Treatment: Mother Nichola claims that Prioderm head lice shampoo may have contributed to the fire which injured her daughter

Mrs O’Donohoe, who says she has suffered with post-traumatic stress since the accident, added: ‘Originally her face looked like red candle wax. We couldn’t go into a shop without people staring, pointing and even shrieking.

'Every time we went out I felt like I was being stabbed in the heart.

‘Luckily her features have recovered, her eyebrows and eyelashes have grown back. The fact Jodie is alive is only by the grace of God.

Recovering: Jodie, pictured at the age of eight, three years after she suffered her horrific injuries

‘Only now has she been able to talk about what happened. She couldn’t look at any pictures of her face. It is so difficult for her to talk about it.’

It is still not known exactly what caused the fire to break out.

The manufacturers of Prioderm, Reckitt Benckiser, told the Irish Daily Mail yesterday: ‘At the time of the incident, which we understand was in 2007, Prioderm was part of the Seton/SSL portfolio which was later acquired by Reckitt Benckiser in November 2010.

'There are no safety issues with the product when used in accordance with the instructions.’
