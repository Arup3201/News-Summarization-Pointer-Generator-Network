Samantha Cameron has appealed for voters to re-elect her husband, putting to bed rumours that she was fed up with life at No 10.

The Prime Minister’s wife said her husband David would see out another five years at Downing Street if he is returned to power on May 7. 

Mrs Cameron told an interviewer: ‘I desperately want my husband to win the election. Obviously, it’s up to the British people. 

'If he wins we will be here for another five years.’

Speaking to the Sun ahead of tonight’s Comic Relief, Mrs Cameron, 43, described herself as a ‘hands off’ political wife and gave new insight into their home life.

She told the newspaper: ‘I don’t think he takes my advice about politics. I wouldn’t want him to. 

'It would be too much of a responsibility for me. We talk about stuff when he gets upstairs.’

But she also spoke of the difficulties and responsibilities of moving into Downing Street - saying she had done her best to keep the family’s personal lives unchanged.

Mrs Cameron, who was pictured alongside comic David Walliams in a publicity shot, said: ‘For the older children, when we came here it was very daunting. 

'You feel very protective of your marriage and your children but the children go to the same school, and I go to the same job. And school is very supportive.’

She also praised the work of Comic Relief, especially their efforts to get rid of the stigma around mental and physical disabilities.

The Camerons' eldest son, Ivan, died from complications of debilitating Ohtahara Syndrome in 2009 aged just six. 

Speaking about her home life with the Prime Minister, Mrs Cameron said they try to make as much family time as possible including having breakfast together each morning and taking the children to school

Speaking about her life in Downing Street, she added: ‘It does make a different living here, getting family-work balance. Dave is very busy but gets up at 5.30am to do his red box.

‘That means we can all have breakfast together on days he’s not travelling. It means he can pop up in the evening, say good night to the children. 

'There’s nothing we don’t do. We go to the cinema, take the kids to the school, I take the children three or four times a week. 

'We go to the school quiz night. Normally we do quite badly. I’m terrible at general knowledge. I get my husband to do history and politics.

‘We’re a bit further away from the children’s school friends. The children come back here for play dates and sleepovers but you are a bit further away from that network. 

'All the parents get used to popping in and out.

‘He’s a very good cook. He finds that very relaxing. Nancy’s learning to cook. I’m trying to train them to tidy up as they go along but it’s slightly futile. 

'I am quite tidy and he’s not very good at picking up his clothes. Newspapers lying everywhere. That’s the other one.’ 

Mrs Cameron made the comments during a fundraising event at the flat the family lives in above No 11 alongside comic David Walliams.

The choice of celebrity will no doubt prove a slightly sore spot for the PM, because when Mrs Cameron was asked to name her favourite David, she chose Walliams.

In a previous interview, Mr Cameron said: 'Samantha admitted to me the other day that her favourite David is David Walliams, which I thought was disappointing as she's married to me.

'She sat next to him at a charity function and said he was the funniest man she'd ever met so I'm going to have to learn to live with that.'

Mrs Cameron added that while David is a very good cook, he is also messy, constantly leaving clothes and newspapers strewn around the house (pictured, she supports her husband after a run in his constituency)

Mr Walliams has been a frequent visitor to Downing Street. In March 2012 the comic, writer and Britain's Got Talent judge posed on the steps of Number 10 with his supermodel wife Lara Stone.

And in 2013 he led a UNICEF campaign with 100 schoolchildren, when he could not resist the temptation to touch the Prime Minister's hair.

Mr Walliams said later: 'Because I'm taller than him, I offered to stand on a lower step so we wouldn't look odd together - he's a tall man but I'm ridiculously tall.

'He's the Prime Minister so he should be the one who is most powerful-looking. 

'He told me not to flick my hair like my character Sebastian in Little Britain, who flirted with the PM relentlessly. Of course, I immediately did it.

In previous interviews, Mr Cameron has revealed that he and his wife try to cook a meal or go out for a date together once a week 'when they have time'.

The Prime Minister added: 'Everyone has their own keys to a happy marriage, but for us that has really worked.'
