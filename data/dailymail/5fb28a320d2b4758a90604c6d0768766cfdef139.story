One of five boyhood friends severely injured while watching the Boston Marathon has spoken out about the crippling wounds he sustained in the April 15 bomb attack.

Jarrod Clowery is expected to recover from his wounds after doctors pulled 27 nails, BBs and other pieces of shrapnel out of his body. The bomb blast shredded his hands, badly injured his legs and burned much of his body.

After the blast, he said he looked down at his hands and quickly looked away. 'It was too much to look at,' he said today during a press conference at Boston's Brigham and Women's hospital.

He then looked down at his legs, and quickly turned his gaze away from them, too. 'I didn’t want to look at those anymore, either,' he said.

Recovering: Jarrod Clowery is recovering after doctors pulled 27 pieces of shrapnel, including nails and BBs from his body after the Boston Marathon bombings

Banding together: Mr Clowery vowed to leave the hospital before his three friends who lost legs and do everything he could to help them return to a normal life

As badly injured as Mr Clowery was, some of his friends came away far worse. Childhood buddies Paul and JP Norden - both brothers - and Marc Fucarile all lost legs when the second device exploded. His friend James 'Bim' Costello was also badly injured.

Three people were killed in the twin attacks near the finish line of the marathon and 264 others were badly injured. About ten victims lost limbs in the attack.

Mr Clowery, a 35-year-old carpenter from Stoneham, Massachusetts, still cannot walk and will likely have to go back into surgery for doctors to remove some of the remaining 20 pieces of shrapnel in his body. 

He says he has one goal now - to get home before his friends who lost their legs and do whatever he can to help them return to normal life.

'Three of my friends lost limbs, so getting back home, I’m gonna be back there before them, so the first thing I’m gonna do is figure out how to be there for them. As far as something normal, or a vacation, I’d like to talk with my friends about that.… My new job is to be with them, or to be there for them,' he said.

The five friends were caught in the second blast. When the first bomb went off near the Boston Marathon finish line, four of the friends huddled down for cover, not knowing the second bomb was right next to them.

Grateful: Jarrod Clowery said the doctors and nurses at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston worked together more efficiently than 'any play drive Tom Brady every put together' for the New England Patriots

Mr Clowery said 'it all went silent' after he was caught in the bomb blast

Mr Clowery was jumping over a race barricade and was shouting at his girlfriend to do the same when the second bomb went off.

'"Jackie, get your butt in the..." - boom,' Mr Clowery remembers shouting.

'And I just remember feeling engulfed.... Just like the movies, all the sound went away.'

The five friends have already made commitments to stick together as they recover from the horrific injuries.

Two weeks and numerous surgeries later, the friends' health is improving but the tight bond, cemented through years of fishing trips and poker games - and just hanging out like they were that Monday - is what is helping them pull through.

'What's up, kid?' Clowery, 35, asked Paul Norden, 31, on a recent afternoon. Norden is in Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center recovering from having his right left amputated.

Clowery is being treated for burns at Brigham and Women's Hospital, but another friend pushed him, still dressed in his hospital gown, the two blocks so he could visit his pal, The Boston Globe reported.

'Yeah, dude, I escaped,' he said. 'I had to see you. I had to come.'

Paul's older brother, J.P., 33, is just two doors down from Clowery at Brigham and Women's recovering from his own amputation while Fucarile is at Massachusetts General hospital.

Mike Jefferson, the school buddy they came to cheer on at the marathon, was the only one spared.

Feeling guilty he dragged his pals along that fateful day, he now keeps watch over them, sleeping outside Paul Norden's hospital room in case he needs anything.

'He blames himself,' Norden told the Boston Globe. 'But I told him: It's not your fault. That bridge has passed. We have to get to a new place.'

The men, who met at elementary school or youth clubs in the small Massachusetts town of Stoneham, grew up at each others' houses, though the Norden brothers' mom, Liz, who they all called 'Ma,' tended to play host.

They all found jobs in the construction industry, but the past winter had a been a brutal one with work slowing and paychecks stretching thin, according to the Globe.

Now they face months of rehabilitation and the Norden brothers and Fucarile must learn to walk again using prosthetic legs. And it's likely the laborers will need to find new careers.

Paul Norden is set to be transferred to a rehabilitation hospital this week but his main concern is that his brother, who is not yet ready to leave the Brigham, ends up at the same one.

'I have to go to rehab with my brother,' he told The Globe.

Emotional, Paul Norden recalled the first phone call the brothers, who still haven't seen each other, shared after the tragedy, when they each learned the other had lost a leg.

It ended: 'I love you. We'll get through this no matter what.'

The Stoneham community and others are fundraising to help the friends pay for their treatment.
