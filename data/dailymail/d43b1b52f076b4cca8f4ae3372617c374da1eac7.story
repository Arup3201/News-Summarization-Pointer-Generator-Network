Outspoken actress Miriam Margolyes has made a very short and sharp comment to express her dislike for Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott.

The English performer, who divides her time between the U.K. and Australia, did not hold back when asked what she thought of the man in the country's top job by an audience member on the ABC TV show Q&A.

Famous for her no-nonsense manner, the 73-year-old Harry Potter star bluntly replied with: 'I think he's a tit'.

Twitter lit up with nothing but praise for Margolyes' bold remark with one suggesting she become the next PM

The woman prefaced the question by pointing out that Margolyes had previously described former Labor Prime Minister Julia Gillard as fascinating - and that she even went as far to say that Bob Hawke, another former Labor Prime Minister, was 'just ravishing'.

The woman then asked if the actress had a similar opinion of the current leader which caused the studio to erupt into laughter.

Following Margolyes' comment, which is a word commonly used as an insult in Britain, she remained unusually quiet when fellow panel members had their say.

Editor-in-chief of Mamamia. Jamila Rizvi, was the first to chime in with 'I think you're supposed to say ten points to Hufflepuff' - making a reference to Harry Potter in which the actress stars in one of the movies as Professor Sprout.

The show's host, Tony Jones, then asked Assistant Treasurer Josh Frydenberg to describe his boss in just one word and then suggested that some of his colleagues describe him as 'doomed'.

Twitter followers are impressed with how Margolyes isn't afraid to say what she thinks

Mr Frydenberg was quick to respond that Mr Abbott was 'decent' and then felt the need to elaborate because he felt he was a minority with that particular view in the room.

'This is a guy who well before he ventured into politics was a hard-working member of his local community as an SES volunteer, as a surf lifesaver,' he said. 

'He doesn't go out and do that stuff with a camera in tow - he's a father of three beautiful girls, he's a happily married husband and he's and he's hard worker in this top job.'

Ms Rizvi then replied that the first word that came to her mind when she thought of Mr Abbott was: 'time-limited ....with a hyphen'.

While Trisha Jha, from the Centre for Independent Studies, chose to stay out of the slinging match.

'I only have one thing to say and that is the tit is a lovely bird,' she said.

Meanwhile, Twitter lit up with nothing but praise for Margolyes' bold remark.

#Miriam Margolyes is aaaaawwwssssoooommmmm #qanda Finally someone not fearful to sy real facts,' Abby Saleh posted.

'Great work #Miriam Margolyes say it how it is! Love ya work!' Lisa Turner said.

While another user was impressed that a Harry Potter reference got a mention on the show.

'Hufflepuff came up during serious political  discussions on #qanda #miriam @jkorwling.'
