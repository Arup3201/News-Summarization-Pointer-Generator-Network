Jonathan Evans, 50, has been put on the Sex Offender Register after he thrust his crotch in a woman's face, pictured at Manchester Crown Court

A married father-of-two has been put on the Sex Offender Register after he thrust his crotch in a woman's face and then forcefully groped her bottom at a crowded pub.

Former Royal Navy weapons expert Jonathan Evans, 50, asked a woman to bend down to pick up a train ticket, then grabbed her head and simulated oral sex in front of onlookers.

On the same evening, the Barnardo's volunteer groped the woman's bottom while she was at the bar of a Wetherspoons pub in Manchester and rammed his finger through her skirt.

He has been handed a three-year community order and must pay a £60 victim surcharge after being found guilty of two counts of sexual assault in an earlier trial at Manchester Crown Court.

The victim did not complain on the night of the assault but subsequently went to police and described feeling 'stupid, gullible and worthless.'

In an interview the woman said: 'He grabbed the back of my head by the hair and pushed my face in his private parts and started moving. I couldn't get up.

'I was probably only down there a couple of seconds but it felt a lot longer. I was angry and embarrassed and ashamed. He'd done it front of people, and just the fact he thought it was alright to do that. I remember being angry at myself for being upset.'

Prosecutor Gavin Howie told the court how the trouble started on a night out in July 2013 when Evans got drunk and picked on the woman at Wetherspoons Picadilly while waiting to get a train home.

He said: 'At some point the defendant appears to have indicated a ticket on the floor. He invited her to pick it up. She did bend to pick it up where Mr Evans took hold of the back of her head, thrust his groin in her face and simulated oral sex with her.

'She describes it as humiliating and degrading. There was another incident a short while he put his hand behind her. He accepts there was some boisterous horseplay and the first incident was a laddish prank.'

Describing the second attack the woman said: 'I remember he did it with a lot of force and that it was painful. It sounds really stupid, but he did it quite fast and in exactly the right place - I remember thinking, how did he know it was there?

'I was blaming myself for being stupid and decided to get really, really drunk, and it was more or less the day after I was just, really, really upset.'

Evans, who was sacked by Barnardos after being convicted, continues to protest his innocence, saying the first incident was 'horseplay', and claiming the second didn't happen.

The father from Ramsbottom, near Bury sobbed as a female judge told him he had escaped jail 'by a whisker'

Judge Lindsey Kushner QC told him: 'I have had so many references and letters of support and I don't think I have had a trial with so many.

'They say whatever you are accused of doesn't fit the man they know. All these people say what you were accused of is out of character. But as we do now know: there is another side to Jonathan Evans, which they have not born witness to.

'I can't emphasise enough that when people like you indulge in such conduct, even if you regard it as mild or funny, it is up to the recipient to decide whether that conduct is acceptable or not. The problem is that in this situation it is often the recipient that feels they are in the wrong if they are made to feel uncomfortable.

'They have to think, 'am I making a fuss about nothing?' they are made to feel it is their fault because they are lacking a sense of humour and failing to see the funny side.

'When I came to this courtroom I came ready and prepared to send you to prison. I can do so without losing one minute's sleep as a result.

'Although I think you probably deserve a prison sentence I'm going to err on the side of hopefully instilling some rehabilitation. I think this has really hit you hard, because you are egotistical. I think you need to show you are a worthy man and you are not. You have escaped prison by a whisker.'

Evans had called character witnesses including a BA pilot, research scientist and a teacher to testify he was a 'pillar of their community' and a 'really decent man'.

In court the father-of-two showed jurors the 'forward thrusting motion' he used to play his prank.

But he insisted: 'It was a stupid, laddish, impulsive thing - I went 'wahey' and I may well have put my hand on her head or her neck, I certainly didn't grab her hair. I lurched forward towards her face.

'It was not meant in any way as a sexual assault - I would never do that. It was meant as a stupid prank  with someone I thought would have just laughed it off. I bitterly regret what I did. I'm sorry for what I did and I'm sorry that I have caused my poor wife to suffer.'
