A fitness company and a director have been fined nearly £40,000 after a customer had his finger severed when putting together a faulty running machine.

James Max, 37, bought the £340 treadmill with his wife Natalie, 33, in a bid to lose weight and improve his fitness.

But as he putting the machine together a spring-loaded hydraulic arm flew open and sliced off the tip of his wedding ring finger.

He employed a company to examine the treadmill and they discovered the remains of his finger inside, but it was too late for it to be re-attached.

IRG Europe Ltd and director James Sharkey were fined a total of £39,600 this week after they admitted supplying the machine which was not safely packaged and with insufficient instructions.

Nottingham Crown Court heard Mr Max was constructing the machine on April 30 last year at his home in Aslockton, Nottinghamshire when the incident occurred.

He was rushed to the Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham but doctors could do nothing to reconstruct the top portion of his finger which had been torn off.

Speaking after the case, Mr Max said: 'This injury has changed my life, I work with computers and I am now having to learn to type again.

'I used to be fast and be able to touch-type but not anymore, I am starting from scratch.

Father-of-one Mr Max says the injury has made it his work with computers more difficult

'Little things such as shaking someone's hand, gardening or opening a bottle are hard for me and I have to think about those things more which I will learn to get used to.

'I do have mobility in my finger, although the nerve ending was cut which is why it makes things difficult for me to do things.

'I am glad it didn't happen to my daughter, who was in another room at the time, that would have been truly awful.

'Since the incident I have bought another treadmill and the warnings on the box and packaging were easy to see, so there were no more injuries.

Mr Max was attempting to put a IM Fitness Stamina XTI Treadmill together when the accident happened. IRG Europe Ltd admitted supplying the machine, which was not safely packaged and with insufficient instructions

'I haven't had an apology from IRG Europe Ltd or James Sharkey, I would like one, but I doubt it will be coming anytime soon, which is a shame.'

Councillor Glynn Gilfoyle, Chair of Nottinghamshire County Council's Community Safety Committee, said: 'This company has blatantly ignored current safety standards and have put their customers at risk of severe injury.

'Unfortunately, James Max has suffered greatly due their negligence which would have been avoided with proper warnings to prevent the treadmill from flipping up.

'All sellers have a responsibility to ensure that their products are safe and we will pursue those who flagrantly flout current safety standards.'
