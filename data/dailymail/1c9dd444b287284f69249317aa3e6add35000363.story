Rep. Kevin McCarthy was voted the next House Majority Leader on Thursday as fellow Republicans shuffled their leadership in the wake of Rep. Eric Cantor's primary defeat in Virginia.

McCarthy, 49, triumphed over Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho to continue his rapid rise through the leadership ranks. The totals of the secret ballot election were not immediately disclosed.

The California representative had been serving as his party's whip, or chief vote counter, since Republicans took control of Congress in 2011.

His ascension set up a three-way election to fill his current spot in the leadership, involving Reps. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Peter Roskam of Illinois and Marlin Stutzman of Indiana.

Scalise, 28, came out the victor for that position in a quick, single ballot vote, making him the House's third-highest ranking Republican.

Meet the new House Majority Leader, Kevin McCarthy: McCarthy defeated fellow Republican Rep. Raul Labrador for the position in today's leadership race

Rep. Steve Scalise, who leads a conservative of group of lawmakers in the Republican Study Committee, arrives with his GOP House allies to cast ballots for new party leaders this afternoon. Scalise was elected to fill the whip position being vacated by McCarthy

At a press conference after the vote, McCarthy said, 'I will work every single day to 
make sure this conference has the courage to lead with the wisdom to 
listen. And we'll turn this country around.'

Likewise, Scalise told reporters, 'We've got solid conservative solutions that are gonna solve the problems facing our country.'

The elections followed a brief campaign set in motion little more than a week ago, when Cantor, the current majority leader, lost his primary election to little-known, underfunded tea party-backed challenger David Brat.

The day after the primary, Cantor resigned from his position in Republican leadership, effective July 31, and endorsed his close friend McCarthy to lead in his stead.

McCarthy, moved quickly to line up the votes for majority leader in the wake of Cantor's defeat at the polls in Virginia, deploying an organization developed since he became whip more than three years ago when Republicans took control of the House.

One potential rival, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, decided against joining the race, while another, Rep. Jeb Hensarling of Texas, deferred to a second Texan, Rep. Pete Sessions.

Sessions quickly dropped out, though, saying it was obvious that a successful campaign would have created painful divisions within the party.

Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho jumped in, but by then, the California front-runner had amassed support from across the rank and file.

Labrador's inability to corral members of his state's Republican Party at a convention last weekend, of which he was the chair, also undercut his argument that he he could effectively lead House Republicans.

McCarthy was aided not only by personal ties, but by the fundraising prowess he has displayed since joining the leadership.

His Majority Committee PAC gave nearly $1.2 million to Republican House candidates and organizations during the two-year election cycle of 2011-2012, and an additional $480,000 to candidates so far in advance of this fall's balloting.

'Given the one week duration of this race, there’s really not a credible way of mounting a really serious challenger campaign because you have to engage the outside forces and do all the other nuts and bolts of politics which is really difficult to do in a week,' Republican Rep. Mark Sanford told Buzzfeed on Wednesday.

'I’d say if conservatives are frustrated in November, I would argue there’s a much greater shot of making a change at that point because you’d have time in which to do so.'

Conservatives at the non-profit political outfit FreedomWorks weren't deterred by their candidate's loss in today's election for that exact reason.

'Rep. Labrador’s impressive performance is indicative of a growing liberty caucus that is ready to make a policy agenda of individual liberty and fiscal responsibility a priority in the House,' FreedomWorks president Matt Kibbe said in a statement.

'We are looking forward to an even bigger group of liberty leadership candidates after the elections in November.”

Virginia Rep. Eric Cantor will stay Majority Leader until July 31

If
 McCarthy's ascension seemed a foregone conclusion, the battle to take 
his whip's spot was anything but — so much so that there was speculation
 that a second ballot might be required to settle the contest.

Congressional
 leadership races are traditionally contests that turn on personal 
relationships, geographical considerations, ideology and more. Inside 
the current GOP rank-and-file, moderates needed not apply. Instead, the 
various candidates stressed their conservative credentials.

In the end, Scalise, a Louisiana Congressman who won his seat in a special election in 2008, knocked out his opponents in one round.

Roskam,
 52, will stay in the position directly below Scalise as chief deputy whip.

The fourth-term congressman had sought to move 
up the leadership ladder among a group of politicians that often prefers
 breaking precedent rather than following it.

But Scalise's argument that the House needed a red-state, conservative Republican in the top -tier of leadership proved effective.

In setting quick elections, Speaker 
John Boehner and other leaders hoped to avoid a drawn-out, divisive 
struggle that might complicate the party's drive to retain its majority 
in midterm balloting on Nov. 4.

Boehner may have a whole other set of problems on his hands now, though, as Scalise, who heads the conservative Republican Study Committee, is slated to become his chief vote wrangler.

The RSC has sometimes served as a conservative thorn in the side of leadership in the past, straying from party-line votes when it felt leadership was compromising too much with the other side.

With Scalise helping to run the show, conservatives and Tea Partiers will be more empowered than they were before to stop legislation they disagree with from getting to the floor.

Scalise received a 100 percent rating from the American Conservative Union in 2013, meaning he voted along conservative lines on every single piece of legislation that was important to the right-wing of the party.

By comparison, the average House Republican ACU rating in 2013 was 76.48 percent.

Labrador also received a 100 percent rating in 2013, while Boehner scored an 86.99 rating and McCarthy a 90.42.

Despite Scalise's conservative credentials, right-leaning groups stayed out of today's whip race, with Freedomworks' Kibbe saying either 'Stutzman or Scalise would be an upgrade' from past leadership.
