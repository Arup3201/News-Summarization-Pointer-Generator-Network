Rolf Harris abused at least 19 women and children, including a celebrity, it can now be revealed.

Many were prepared to testify, but prosecutors decided to concentrate on the strongest cases.

Police mugshot: 84-year-old Rolf Harris is facing a lengthy jail term after he was found guilty of using his fame to abuse four victims, including two children, over 18 years

HIS DAUGHTER’S BEST FRIEND: She was just three years old when she first met Rolf Harris after becoming best friends with his daughter Bindi.

Within a decade he was molesting the ‘excruciatingly shy’ teenager, using her ‘like a toy’ in a sickening abuse of trust that continued for 16 years.

The victim said she ‘felt dead’ after being repeatedly assaulted by the entertainer, who used her for his sexual gratification as if she was a ‘blow-up doll’.

Her nightmare started when she was 13 after being invited on a five-week holiday in Hawaii with the Harris family.

Harris pounced on her in a hotel suite, touching the ‘shocked and panicked’ girl intimately as she came out of a shower wearing just a towel.

Days later, he molested her again – just yards from his sunbathing wife and daughter – after handing her a towel as she emerged from the sea.

The abuse continued after they returned from holiday, with the teen saying she ‘felt disgusted’ for letting him do it but was afraid to speak out.

On one occasion he even performed a sex act on her in Bindi’s bedroom while his daughter slept close by.

She said: ‘He didn’t feel inhibited. I think he got a thrill out of it. From the look on his face – he was looking over at Bindi and then just carried on.’

Harris regularly abused the youngster in her own bedroom on visits to her home, before returning downstairs to make jokes with her parents.

Unable to cope, she was binge-drinking by the age of 14.

The abuse continued into adulthood, by which time she had been ‘psychologically destroyed and trained to perform like a pet’, the court heard.

He touched her intimately in his dressing room at Wimbledon Theatre just before he was due to perform in Cinderella.

The woman finally confronted him when she was in her early 30s, prompting him to apologise and write a letter to her father pleading for forgiveness for his behaviour – but insisting it had been an affair which began after she was 18.

She finally resolved to report him to police after watching him perform his hit Two Little Boys at the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012.

She said: ‘The TV was on and Rolf Harris was on and I thought, “I just can’t get away from this bloody man”.

‘I just burst into tears... it was like he was invading my home. That’s when I decided that I wasn’t going to have any more of it.’

Asked why she had taken so long to go to the authorities, she replied: ‘I was just so scared of him. He was this big man on the telly and I thought no one would believe me.’

VERDICT: Guilty on all seven counts

Disgraced: After the verdicts were read Harris raised his eyebrows to his wife Alwen, who was sat watching in the public gallery with his daughter Bindi

THE YOUNG FAN: Harris’s youngest victim was just seven when he groped her at a community centre in Portsmouth after she asked for his autograph in 1969. When she got on stage, he plunged his ‘big hairy hands’ between her legs ‘aggressively’, fondling her twice.

VERDICT: Guilty on one count

THE WAITRESS: A 13-year-old girl was groped by Harris after watching him entertain a crowd of people in Cambridge by crouching on all fours like a dog.

The woman, who is now in her 50s, told how Harris slipped his arm around her, rubbing his hands down from her shoulders to her bottom as she froze in shock.

Harris claimed that she was lying and said he had never been to Cambridge until four years ago. But the jury later saw footage of him taking part in a TV show in the town in 1978.

VERDICT: Guilty on one count

AND OTHER VICTIMS  WHO CAME FORWARD

THE CELEBRITY: A familiar face on our screens for decades, the TV presenter was interviewing Harris live on air almost 20 years ago when she suddenly felt his hand ‘worming’ its way under her skirt, gripping her thigh and grasping at her knickers.

Recoiling in horror, she stopped the interview, calling out for a commercial break.

Lies: Harris had claimed that he was the victim of malicious lies, and was being punished for his infidelity, but the jury believed the women who said he abused them

Scrum: Harris scrambles into a waiting limousine and will return to court on Friday where he will be sentenced for his sex crimes

‘You can see the look of astonishment on her face when she feels his indecent assault,’ Sasha Wass, QC, prosecuting, told a pre-trial hearing.

The household name came forward at the start of the trial, but she was not allowed to testify after Harris’s lawyers said it would be impossible to investigate her claims before the close of the case.

THE MICHAEL PARKINSON PARTY: Harris grabbed a young waitress during a party for TV star Michael Parkinson at a Berkshire pub about ten years ago, kissing her neck in front of his wife Alwen.

THE HOLIDAYMAKER: A vulnerable 24-year-old woman was attacked after meeting Harris while on holiday with friends in 1999. He pounced on the victim – who suffered from psychiatric problems – in a garden before later climbing into bed with her and sexually assaulting her while she was sleeping.

THE AUTOGRAPH HUNTER: A teenage girl was attacked at a fete in Harris’s home town of Bray after approaching him for an autograph around 1996. Harris was posing for photographs when he told her he liked her jumper ‘and wanted to see what was underneath it’.

THE YOUNG ARTIST: Harris was posing for photographs at an art competition in London in 2001 when he pinched the bottom of a 20-year-old.

THE AUSTRALIAN BROADCASTERS: During the trial, two Australian broadcasters waived their right to anonymity to tell how he sexually assaulted them.

Perth radio show host Jane Marwick, 45, said he grabbed her breast while posing for a photograph with her in 2001.

Verity James, also from Perth, said after a pre-recorded interview Harris leant in for a hug and ‘felt her up’ in the late 1990s or early 2000s.
