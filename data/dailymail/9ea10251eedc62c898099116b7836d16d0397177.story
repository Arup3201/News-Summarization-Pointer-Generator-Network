A family has been forced out of their home for Christmas after their pet Beagle set fire to the kitchen by turning on the hob with her paw.

Ten-month-old Muffin was home alone when she accidentally ignited a flame as she jumped around the kitchen top.

As clothing near the electric oven caught fire, the ground floor went up in flames and Muffin was left barking for her life.

Jill Tonge, 33, from Bolton, left Muffin home alone for a morning and came back to a blackened kitchen

Shock: Ms Tonge said her children, Jayden, 11, and Lexi, 7, are devastated two days before Christmas

Hearing the alarms and cries, the next-door neighbour to the semi-detached home in Farnworth, Greater Manchester, called the emergency services, stopping the blaze from spreading further.

Firefighters forced their way into the property and rescued Muffin at 
around 10.30am on Saturday, arriving within a minute of the neighbour's call.

Despite tackling the flames immediately, 
the kitchen is wrecked, all the doors will need to be 
replaced and the walls are black with smoke.

Today homeowner Jill Tonge, 33, who was at work at the time, said she and her two children are devastated as they will not be home for Christmas.

She said: 'It has ruined Christmas a bit because I wanted to have it at home with 
my kids with all our own decorations up. But I’m just trying not to let 
it get to me for the kids’ sake.

Still learning: As she is just a puppy, the family hope Muffin will grow out of her hyperactiveness. But failing that, Ms Tonge admitted she may concede to buying some sort of cage

'When I told them Muffin had started
 the fire they were devastated because they love her to pieces. I just 
had to tell them that she didn’t mean to do it.'

Luckily the family’s presents were not damaged in the fire but any hopes of Christmas dinner at home have been dashed.

Ms Tonge and her children Jayden, 11, and Lexi, 7, will have to go to her parents, where Muffin is already causing havoc.

'They aren’t used to the dog. She’s a barker,' she said. 'But she has been very quiet since the fire - I thought maybe she was embarrassed. But then yesterday she woke my mum up at 6am so she’s back to her old ways.'

Muffin suffered smoke inhalation and was seen by a vet but is now back to full fitness.

Despite the damage, Ms Tonge says her feelings for Muffin are still the same, though she may consider new ways of controlling her behaviour.

The firefighters arrived at 10.30am on Saturday and managed to prevent the fire from spreading, and saved Muffin

She said: 'Muffin is a mischievous dog and she’s very feisty. She can be boisterous at times but she’s still young so she’s still learning.

'She’s
 our first dog and we’ve only had her since April. I’ll definitely think
 twice about leaving her in the house alone from now on. I might even 
have to get her a cage which I don’t want to do but I can’t risk 
anything like this happening again.

'When my neighbour rang me up and told me there was a fire at the house I just wanted to know if the dog was alright. I wasn’t angry with the dog, I was just so worried.

'Apparently she ran upstairs and hid in the bedroom. She must have been so scared. I’m obviously devastated about the damage but there’s nothing I can do now - you just have to get on with it.

'I still love the dog to pieces but I never thought she could do anything like that. It’s definitely made me more wary. I’m just pleased the kids were at my mum’s and my neighbour was in. Although we can’t live in the house at the moment because it’s still really smoky.'
