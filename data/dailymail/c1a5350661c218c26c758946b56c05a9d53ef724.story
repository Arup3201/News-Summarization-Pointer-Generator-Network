Archaeologists have uncovered a stone tool in Oregon that suggests humans occupied the western US earlier than thought.

The agate tool was uncovered under a thick layer of volcanic ash dating back to the eruption of Mount St Helens 15,800 years ago.

Scientists believe the primitive knife, discovered 12ft (3.6 metres) below ground, was used for cutting animal hides, butchering meat, and carving wood by pre-Clovis people. 

Archaeologists have uncovered a stone tool in Oregon that suggests humans occupied the western US earlier than thought. The agate tool was uncovered under a thick layer of volcanic ash dating back to the eruption of Mount St Helens 15,800 years ago 

The find, at Rimrock Draw Rockshelter, was announced today by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, which controls the land on which the site was found. 

Archaeologist Scott Thomas said that if the age of the area holds up to scrutiny, it would be the oldest pre-Clovis find west of the Rockies.

It would also be older than another predating the so-called Clovis culture, once generally believed to be the first people to migrate from Asia into North America. 

The earliest Clovis artifacts, known for distinctive and elegant stone points, are dated to about 13,000 years ago.

Professor Patrick O'Grady from Oregon University called the find 'tantalising.'

But he added that they want to continue digging this summer to see whether the volcanic ash covers the entire area.

Donald Grayson, professor of archaeology at the University of Washington, said the scientific community would be skeptical.

Two pre-Clovis sites are well documented and generally accepted by scientists.

One is Paisley Cave, located about 60 miles southwest of the Rimrock site. The other is Monte Verde in Chile. Both are dated about 1,000 years before the oldest Clovis sites.

If the date of Rimrock holds up, it would put people at the site about 1,500 years earlier, at the end of the Pleistocene era, when mastodons, mammoths, camels, horses and bison roamed the area.

Much of discoveries at these sites indicate the people were involved in hunting, gathering and fishing, for which they used bone tools. 

Some sites suggest that pre-Clovis people sometimes lived in hut clusters. Many were situated along the coastline, suggesting a marine lifestyle. 

Many archaeologists favour the theory that they came over the Bering Strait crossing from northeastern Asia.

'No one is going to believe this until it is shown there was no break in  that ash layer, that the artifact could not have worked its way down from higher up, and until it is published in a convincing way,' he said. 

'Until then, extreme skepticism is all they are going to get.'

The find has yet to be submitted to a scientific journal for publication, but it has been reported in newsletters and at conferences.

Thomas found the site several years ago, while taking a break from carrying supplies to a session of the University of Oregon Archaeological Field School nearby that O'Grady was overseeing.

He said he noticed an outcropping of an ancient lava flow, with some very tall sage brush growing in front of it, indicating very deep sediment deposits. 

Rimrock Draw Rockshelter is located near Riley Oregon in Harney County in southeast Oregon. If the date of Rimrock holds up, it would put people at the site about 1,500 years earlier, at the end of the Pleistocene era, when mastodons, mammoths, camels, horses and bison roamed the area

The soil was black in front of the rock, indicating someone regularly built cooking fires there for a long time. 

An ancient streambed ran by, which would have given people more reason to stay there. 

And on the surface, he found a stone point of the stemmed type, found at sites both older and younger than Clovis. Similar points have been found at Paisley Cave

Volunteers looking around the surface found some 30 stemmed points, and the field school started excavations in 2011, O'Grady said.

Uncovered above and below the volcanic ash layer were fragments of teeth believed to be from ancient camels.

Tests by Archaeological Investigations Northwest of Portland on blood residue on the agate scraper were consistent with the bovid family of animals, Thomas said. 

The most likely bovine animal living in Oregon at that time would have been an ancestor of the buffalo.
