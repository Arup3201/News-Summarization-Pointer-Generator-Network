Just months after he was rumored to be getting back together with ex-mistress V. Stiviano, 80-year-old Donald Sterling has been spotted out with a new young woman. 

The former Los Angeles Clippers owner, who was forced to sell his team this summer amid a racism scandal, was pictured shopping in Beverley Hills on Monday with a mystery brunette wearing sunglasses to conceal her identity.

Sterling made so much money selling his team to ex-Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer for a record $2billion that he chose to buy an iPhone in person at an AT&T store, on a day when all the holiday deals were online for Cyber Monday. 

The pictures taken Monday show Sterling walking discreetly behind the unidentified woman, with coordinated all-black outfits.

Moving on: The 80-year-old first made headlines last spring when audio recorded by his then-girlfriend V. Stiviano 'leaked' revealing his prejudices towards African-Americans

Shopping date: On Monday, Sterling and the young woman walked into an AT&T store and stood side by side at the counter speaking with a sales associate 

They even dress alike! Sterling and the woman appeared to be coordinating outfits, both wearing all black and sunglasses 

The two were captured walking into an AT&T store where they stood side by side at the counter, talking to a sales associate together.  

Sterling is seen meandering around the store, before sitting down with an employee and taking out his card to make a purchase. 

He is then pictured leaving the store solo, clutching a brand new iPhone. 

The idea that Sterling may have moved on to a new young mistress is surprising considering there were rumors he had reunited with ex V Stiviano in August.

Stiviano is the reason the real estate mogul got into hot water last spring, when an audio conversation she recorded was 'leaked' and revealed Sterling to have prejudices against African Americans. Stiviano herself is both Latina and black. 

The scandal got Sterling booted from the league and eventually he was forced to sell his team this summer, with former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer stepping up to buy the team for $2billion. 

Sterling and Stiviano were last reported together in August, when Sterling's wife Shelly called 911 from vacation in France to say her husband's former mistress has sneaked into their California home to 'torment' him.

When officers arrived on the scene, Sterling told them that Stiviano was his 'invited guest' and they left without making an arrest.

The pictures of Sterling on Monday were taken as a judge ruled to drop charges against a New York man who attacked Stiviano this past summer. 

Dominick Diorio was charged with misdemeanor assault for allegedly punching Stiviano in the face and calling her the n-word outside a Meatpacking District hotel on June 1. 

But a judge decided Monday that the charges against the 40-year-old will be dropped if he avoids rearrest for the next six months.  

Monday's decision was just the latest legal blow to Stiviano. Last month, a judge in California decided to throw out her defamation lawsuit against Shelly Sterling.

The lawsuit claimed that Sterling's wife falsely called her a thief and embezzler in hundreds, if not thousands, of media reports. 

The judge said Stiviano provided no evidence for her claim. 

That lawsuit was filed in the midst of another lawsuit from Shelly Sterling to reclaim $2.5million in gifts Stiviano had received from Donald Sterling during their relationship.

Shelly, who is still married to Sterling despite the two appearing to be estranged, says Stiviano's  gifts were taken from community property that her husband had no right to give away.

Those gifts include a $1.8million duplex, a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover. 

The trial over that lawsuit begins March 9.
