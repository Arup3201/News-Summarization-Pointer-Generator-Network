A woman who had £15,000 weight loss surgery on the NHS shed eight stone before piling the pounds back on.

Lana Harber is now obese again and is warning patients that the operation is not the quick fix many hope for. 

The 41-year-old lost an impressive 8st after she underwent a gastric bypass operation on the recommendation of doctors.

Before: Lana Harber was 19 stone before she had £15,000 weight loss surgery on the NHS

But after shrinking from 19st to 11st in the two years after her operation, she has piled on the pounds after falling back into bad eating habits. 

Miss Harber, from Chatham, Kent, also suffers from polycystic ovarian syndrome which hampers her ability to lose weight naturally. 

She said: ‘I blame no-one but myself, but my experiences have made me realise that gastric operations, which are often viewed as a quick fix, don’t make any difference if the root causes of obesity aren’t addressed.

‘I’ve had low self-esteem rooted in difficult experiences from my childhood that have caused me to comfort eat over the years.’

Success: Miss Harber lost an impressive 8 stone after the surgery to reduce the size of her stomach

Yo-yo: But she has now piled 3st back on again due to comfort eating - and is warning others that weight-loss surgery isn't a cure-all

Despite displaying the symptoms of 
polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) all her adult life, Miss Harber was not
 diagnosed with the condition until she was in her mid-30s and weighed 
17st.

She said: ‘I enjoyed the occasional 
chocolate bar but I didn’t habitually drink litres of fizzy drinks and I
 wasn’t always out eating enormous meals. I found it confusing that I 
managed to become quite so big.

‘I
 learned that PCOS creates problems with insulin production, which 
affects the way food is processed in the body, which is why people with 
the condition often struggle with weight gain.

‘It put my weight problems in context
 but was difficult to hear - I had suffered a miscarriage a year earlier
 and had experienced a rough few months. It was painful to get the 
diagnosis. 

‘I became more depressed which meant I became more sedentary and comfort ate. I kept gaining weight.’

BEFORE BYPASS SURGERY

Breakfast: Slice of toast or porridge

Lunch: Cheese sandwiches

Dinner: Curry with rice or pasta served with chicken or vegetables

Snacks: Half a packet of digestives and two chocolate bars, with odd helpings of chocolate cake, muffins or flapjacks. She said: 'Main meals weren't a problem - but snacking was. I couldn't help dipping into sweet foods throughout the day.' AFTER BYPASS SURGERY

First month: Flavoured milk three times a day

Second month: Pureed food or ready-brek twice a day.

Six months: Small amount of soft pasta or soft rice twice a day.

After a year she could manage half a sandwich for a main meal. 

But as the months passed, she began gorging on chocolate bars as a source of comfort food.

She said: 'It didn't matter to me what chocolate bar it
was, as long as it was chocolate. I fell back into the habit without really
thinking about it.'

HER DIET TODAY

Breakfast: Porridge with banana

Lunch: Cup-a-soup with a small roll

Dinner: Portion-controlled chilli con carne or pasta dish

Snacks: Yogurt or fruit.

An endocrinologist referred Miss 
Harber to a specialist team at St George’s Hospital in London and after a
 year she was told she had been recommended for a gastric bypass 
operation. 

The NHS-funded operation, which costs up to £15,000, took place in March 2009, when she weighed 19st.

Miss
 Harber said: ‘It was reasoned that it was better in the long-run to get
 my weight down quickly to prevent serious problems like diabetes and 
heart disease.

‘I’d never thought about surgery. It had never occurred to me that it would have been offered. But when it was suggested, I paid close attention to what the doctors said.

‘I was surprised at the offer, but I understood the logic. It would have cost the health service more to treat me if I was morbidly obese and diabetic.’

After discussing the matter with her parents, Miss Harber, who is a support worker for deaf people, decided the gastric bypass operation was the right option.

She said: ‘I signed a disclaimer which confirmed I understood that the operation could have complications and serious health consequences. For the two nights leading up to the operation I was very anxious.

‘I ate like a baby for the first few months, slowly introducing solid food back to my diet. It was a challenge, but a dream come true to see the weight drop off so quickly. 

‘Having had no confidence for years, to start thinking about what outfits I would wear to work and for when I was out socialising with friends was truly wonderful.’

But by the spring of 2011, Miss Harber realised that her gastric bypass had not been the fix-all option many hope it will be.

She said: ‘I have painful memories from my childhood and self-esteem issues which the gastric bypass was never going to address.

‘I found myself subconsciously dipping back into the comfort eating. The weight started to creep back up.’

Today, Miss Harber weighs 14st and has excess skin left from her weight loss. She is now having counselling and has started a healthy eating and exercise routine

Today, Miss Harber weighs 14st and has excess skin left from her weight loss.

She said: ‘I’m back at being obese again but I can see a solution. I have a good support network of friends and I’m sure I can get that 3st off again. 

‘I’m having counselling to address the self-esteem issues and has started a healthy eating and exercise routine.

‘My excess skin will never be removed unless I’m judged to be an exceptional case by the health services. I feel embarrassed talking to my doctor about it, because I feel I’ve already had so much help with my weight loss. 

‘There’s an awful feeling that I’m not doing my part to live up to the effort that other people went to for my operation. 

‘But I’ve come to realise that, sadly, if you don’t address the root problems, all the benefits of such operations can be undone.

‘Today whenever I hear anyone say they’re going for weight loss surgery, I always make sure I share my experiences. Patients need to be very mindful following their operations. 

‘If there are psychological or other issues at the root of the weight gain, those issues need to tackled first, or all the effort in the world can go to waste.’
