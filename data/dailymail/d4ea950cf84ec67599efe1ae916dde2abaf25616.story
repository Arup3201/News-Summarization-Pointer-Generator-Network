Stuart Pearce is under increasing pressure  after a Clayton Donaldson-inspired Birmingham City ensured Nottingham Forest’s winless run in the Championship extended to six matches.

David Cotterill’s free-kick gave the visitors the lead before Donaldson fired in a brace before half-time.

Forest could only muster a last-minute consolation through Britt Assombalonga, leaving Pearce at a loss to explain his side’s woeful recent form.

‘It was one of those games, if I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes I wouldn’t have believed it,’ said Pearce. ‘We started very well and had enough chances to win the game. We gave away three horrible goals. They’ve won it with a big charitable donation from Nottingham Forest.

‘I’ve told the players to roll up their sleeves and man up. The defeat today is more of our own doing than Birmingham’s, who did not deserve to win.’

In contrast, Birmingham boss Gary Rowett was overjoyed as his side bounced back from a Boxing Day thumping against Derby. The 4-0 reverse was the worst result of Rowett’s reign at St Andrew’s, but he stuck with the same 11 for this clash and was vindicated for his loyalty.

Rowett said: ‘It shows character because there’s one or two that might have fancied a breather today after that to get them out of the firing line. They’ve manned up and put in an absolutely fantastic performance once again.’

Tactically the match was also a triumph for Rowett as his side, which is set up to counter-attack, continually troubled Forest on the break. Cotterill found the target on 35 minutes after Henri Lansbury’s ugly challenge on Demarai Gray. The midfielder stepped up and hit the free-kick past everyone in the area to find the bottom corner.

The ex-Doncaster man thought he had a second but it was Donaldson who had supplied the final touch. Birmingham worked a quick corner routine to catch the home defence asleep and Cotterill found space on the edge of the box for a shot that the centre forward turned past Karl Darlow.

A third came before the break when Forest allowed Andrew Shinnie to twist and turn his way into the area and Darlow could only palm away his shot. The ball cannoned off the back of one of his own defenders and Donaldson guided the ball into an empty net.

Pearce had clearly laid into his players at half-time and they came flying out of the blocks for the second half. But they could not find a way past the packed Blues defence as Lansbury and Jamie Paterson were frustrated by the Birmingham bodies being thrown into the fray. At the other end City had their chances to make it four with Donaldson and David Davis testing Darlow.

Assombalonga headed in from Ben Osborn’s cross to get Forest on the board, but the damage was done.
