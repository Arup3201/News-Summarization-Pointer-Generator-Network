Leading Blairites called on Ed Miliband to recall Labour’s ‘grown-ups’ to frontline politics yesterday as he was accused of lacking a ‘coherent’ economic policy.

Former minister Chris Mullin said the Labour leader should recall big beasts such as former Cabinet ministers Alistair Darling and Alan Johnson to help rescue the party.

He said Mr Miliband needs ‘a strong, coherent case’ and ‘a credible message’.

Grownups: Many in the Labour party would like to see Alistair Darling (left) and Alan Johnson return to the frontbench

Describing them as ‘grown-ups’ he 
said on Radio 4 that Mr Darling was ‘a very good chancellor and still is
a very credible witness on the economy’ and Mr Johnson was ‘an 
immensely credible figure’.

Mr Mullin said Labour needed to 
counter the ‘vast lie’ that Britain’s economic problems were primarily 
caused by the previous government.

He said the ‘only thing’ the party had to apologise for was not ‘regulating the banks sufficiently’.

Former spin doctor Alastair Campbell also demanded that Mr Miliband get on the front foot over the economy.

In a blog on his website, Mr Campbell
wrote: ‘The very good record of the last Labour government has been 
blunted if not lost as a political weapon. Labour must be more robust in
defending the record, including the Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling 
handling of the global financial crisis.’

Former minister Tony McNulty also 
said: ‘If we have little confidence defending [our] record, why should 
anyone believe our forward offer?’

Mr Miliband has spent the last three weeks on holiday, sparking unease in Labour ranks about the deafening silence of his frontbench.

With signs the economy is recovering, a growing list of MPs and advisers have warned Labour needs to up its game.

Former Blair spin doctor Alastair Campbell warned Labour 'must be more robust in defending the record' of its time in government.

He claimed Labour have played into Tory hands on this, and there needs to be an admission of that, so that even at this late stage, a proper debate and a proper reckoning of the record can be had'.

Message: Former No.10 spin doctor Alistair Campbell said Labour had failed to challenge Tory claims it was to blame for the financial crash

Gordon Brown's former pollster Deborah
Mattinson warned that Labour was ‘slightly lurching from one announcement to the next, or complete silence’.

‘What
voters need to hear is some real clarity about what Labour stands for, 
what Labour believes, how Labour now would be different from how Labour 
has been before.

And that needs to be set out with absolute clarity in a
language that people understand.'

It comes after shadow health secretary Andy Burnham complained that Labour must 'shout louder and speak in a way that captures how people are feeling and thinking'.

Veteran backbenchers George Mudie and Graham Stringer have also warned Mr Miliband;s policies are 'confused'.

However Tom Harris, who stood down from the Labour frontbench this year, likened Mr Miliband to Margaret Thatcher and insisted he was a 'ruthless b******' with the grit to win.

'The kind of steel within Ed Miliband is what the Tories needed nearly 40 years ago and it's what our party needed in 2010. We still need it today. And by 2015 we’ll need it more than ever,' he wrote in an article for the Telegraph.

From April to June the economy grew by 0.6 per cent, double the 0.3 per cent seen in the first quarter of 2013.

New
Bank of England governor Mark Carney last week raised growth forecasts 
for this year from 1.2 per cent to 1.4 per cent and for next year from 
1.7 per cent to 2.5 per cent.

At the same time Mr Cameron and George Osborne have almost doubled their lead over Labour for stewardship of the economy.

Economic competence: The Tory lead over Labour for running the economy has soared from nine points in June to 16 points in August

PM David Cameron, left, and Chancellor George 
Osborne, right, have seen a sharp rise in their economic credibility, 
according to the survey

According to a survey, 40 per cent 
believe the Prime Minister and Chancellor are more capable of managing 
the economy than Ed Miliband and Ed Balls.

Just 24 per cent said the Labour leader and Shadow Chancellor have the right answers – giving the Tories a 16 per cent lead.

It is a dramatic increase from a lead 
of just nine points last month, and will send shockwaves through the 
Labour party as Mr Miliband prepares for another relaunch.

Senior Tories have been careful not to declare they can see ‘green shoots’ of recovery, with Mr Osborne insisting the economy has moved only from ‘repair to recovery’.

With growth up and unemployment down, Labour has been forced to re-rite its attacks on the government, having previously accused ministers of cutting ‘too far, too fast’.

Pressure: After three weeks of almost complete silence from the Labour leadership, the poll will be another blow for Ed Miliband and Ed Balls (right)

Mr Miliband's frontbench have instead claimed that the recovery is only being enjoyed by the wealthy.

But the new message has done nothing to stop voters swinging in behind the Tory leadership’s economic strategy.

According
to the latest ICM survey for the Guardian, the Conservative lead for 
‘competence’ on the economy is at its highest level since December 2012.

To make things worse for Labour, the same survey shows that while the party is ahead overall, it is only just.

On
voting intentions Mr Miliband’s party leads by just 3 per cent, with 35
per cent saying they will vote Labour compared with 32 per cent for the
Conservatives.

Factoring in the margin of error – of plus or minus 3 per cent – shows that the lead may in fact be non-existent.

The Tories have fallen four points over the last month and Labour has gone down 1 per cent.

The
poll is the latest blow for Mr Miliband, who is expected to return to 
the political fray this week with an attack on the government for 
falling wages in real terms.

He has faced criticism for three weeks of all but total silence from his frontbench, leaving the coalition to set the political agenda.

A much-hyped speech on immigration by frontbencher Chris Bryant turned into a fiasco when large sections attacking Tesco and Next had to be rewritten after the retail giants hit back at errors in pre-briefed extracts.

The ICM poll shows UKIP has seen its rating rise from 7 to 10 per cent.

The poll also shows 17 per cent of people think their personal financial circumstances have improved in the last year, compared to 43 per cent who say it has become worse.

A quarter believed their situation would improve in the next year.
