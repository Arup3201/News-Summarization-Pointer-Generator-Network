Police in France and Spain have arrested 75 people who are accused of smuggling Chinese citizens into Europe and the U.S - with some being forced to work as prostitutes.

Spain's Interior Ministry said today that 51 people were arrested in Spain and 24 in France as part of a two-year investigation.

The gang is accused of offering false passports for Â£40,000 to Chinese nationals who were then transported to the U.S., Britain, Spain, France, Greece, Italy and Turkey.

Investigation: A gang which allegedly smuggled Chinese citizens into the U.S and Europe - sometimes forcing them to work as prostitutes - has been raided by police, who made 75 arrests

Some of the people trafficked ended up in the sex trade.The trafficking ring was based in China and the gang's main European hub was 
Barcelona airport.

It allegedly used the northeastern city as a 
stopping-off point for Chinese citizens while false documents were prepared.

According to CNN, the arrests were made last June and the case, which is
being heard at Spain's National Court, has been secret until now.

The suspects are Chinese, or from elsewhere in Asia and among those arrested include the two Barcelona-based suspected heads of the organisation in Europe.

Held: A police officer shows passports, stamps, identification cards, printers and mobile phones found after members of the gang were arrested

Police seized a total of 81 forged passports which were all made in China.

The passports were for Japan, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan.

Detectives also found three laptops, printers and 22 rubber stamps, which police say were used to forge documents at homes.

Arrests: Police also found large amounts of cash as well as a gun. A total of 81 forged passports were also seized

The trafficking ring was highly organised to avoid detection with the smugglers keeping travelers under tight control.

Police said they would often try to pass them off unnoticed among groups of legitimate Chinese tourists.

The suspects have had
initial court appearances with some being held in custody while others have been released by a judge with conditions.
