It's the love that no one could ever have imagined - former Prime Ministers and political opponents Tony Blair and Baroness Thatcher enjoying a post-coital clinch.

And the incredible vision of the pair sharing pillow talk and a sneaky cigarette as Labour gets into bed with the Tories will be broadcast on Channel 4 tomorrow night.

The unimaginable coupling is the brainchild of The Comic Strip Presents writer and director Peter Richardson for his latest outing with the long-running comedy group.

Controversial: The Comic Strip Presents... Stephen Mangan, centre, as a Thatcher-loving Tony Blair in The Hunt For Tony Blair. The show also stars from left, Nigel Planer, Harry Enfield, Jennifer Saunders, Robbie Coltrane, James Buckley and Rik Mayall

It has been dubbed The Hunt For Tony Blair as the plot revolves around the ex-Labour MP for Sedgefield going on the run.

And as the controversial storyline unfolds we see the two former world leaders engaging in a fictional fling.

The show stars Comic Strip stalwart 
Jennifer Saunders as former Tory PM Margaret Thatcher and Strip newcomer Stephen Mangan as Tony Blair.

Saunders, who will return to TV screens in Absolutely Fabulous at Christmas, plays Thatcher as a glamorous 1950s' noir-style vamp for her latest outing.

It's not the first time she has played the Iron Lady - she was Thatcher for a previous Comic Strip outing in Red Nose of Courage in 1992.

Mangan, star of hospital comedy show Green Wing, appears in the show covered in lipstick marks after an encounter with new love Mrs Thatcher.

Saunders said of her preparations for the role that Peter Richardson wanted her to delve into vintage Hollywood to perfect the part.

She said: 'Peter has given me a bit of a difficult remit here - it's Bette Davis but watch Sunset Boulevard but also be Margaret Thatcher.'

'I've been watching YouTube videos of her but I find it very difficult to do real dialogue as her voice as it's such a particular sort of voice, it's very strange because it's very soft, then very strident so it's difficult.'

She spoke warmly of being reunited with her former Comic Strip colleagues, with whom she has worked for three decades.

And added: 'It feels really lovely, like it used to.'

She praised the new additions to the team - Mangan, The Inbetweeners star James Buckley and Harry Enfield.

The AbFab creator said: 'Stephen Mangan is brilliant and totally perfect for it. I think it's great that it moves on and we get new talent in mainly because we are all getting on now so that does limit you.'

The Comic Strip Presents is on Channel 4 tomorrow night at 9pm.

Comic Strip founder Peter Richardson prompted members to sign a 
contract to signify their attachment to the group.Â 

The first line-up consisted of three 
double-acts: Ade Edmondson and Rik Mayall, Nigel Planer and Peter 
Richardson, and Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders.

Other regulars Arnold Brown, Alexei Sayle and Robbie Coltrane also appeared in the show.

As
the group gained more exposure, actors such as Jack Nicholson and Robin 
Williams turned out to watch them before they made it on to TV.

The Comic Strip Presents... debuted the 
opening night of Channel 4, November 2, 1982.

Each episode was prefixed by an animated 
lead-in consisting of the words 'The Comic Strip Presents' accompanied 
by a soundtrack consisting of a drum machine and a Farfisa organ, 
together with a bomb labelled 'Have a nice day', falling towards a map.

Almost straight away the BBC signed Edmondson, Mayall, Planer and Sayle to star in The Young Ones.
