The 16-year-old boy who died after suffering a medical emergency on a Delta flight on Saturday has been identified as Zachary Bisiar.

The teenager, who suffered from cerebral palsy, went into cardiac arrest after a medical emergency 30 minutes after take-off from Seattle on a flight bound for Atlanta.

The boy was flying with his mother, grandmother and younger brother to visit his father, who is stationed at McChord Air Force Base, for Christmas.

The medical examiner's office in Washington's Spokane County said on Monday that the autopsy results for Zachary were still pending further tests.

Forensic pathologist Sally S. Aiken, with Spokane's Medical Examiner office, noted that the cause of the boy's death is currently 'pending' further microscopic and other studies.

In a statement, Dr. Aiken said that it was 'thought to be a rare complication of a rare disease process. The manner of death is natural.'

The plane was diverted to an airport in Spokane, Washington, after the boy suffered a medical emergency and died on board.

'It was a complete surprise - they were completely devastated,' said Spokane Fire Department spokesperson Brian Schaeffer.

Zachary's uncle Steven Leahy has launched a fundraising page to help his sister and her husband cover the expenses involved in funeral which is scheduled for December 22. He hopes to raise $15,000.

‘Please help my sister and her husband who lost their son, Zachary Bisiar, on flight 128 from Seattle to Atlanta,’ he writes on the GoFundMe.com page he has launched.

‘All proceeds will go towards laying him to rest and aiding the family with the difficult time they are having now with the loss of their child.’

The incident happened aboard Delta Flight 128, which departed Seattle around 9 a.m. local time on Saturday.

Washington State patient-confidentiality rules prohibit local officials from divulging such information outside of a coroner’s report, but Schaeffer did say there was nothing in his medical history to suggest such an incident was to be expected.

The boy and his family were sitting at the back of the plane when they began calling for help, passenger Joe Ryan, of Atlanta, told MailOnline.

The flight crew immediately sprung into action. Despite the dire circumstances, everyone – including passengers – remained calm and collected throughout.

‘It was calm and the male flight attendants rushed to his aid at the back of the plane,’ said Ryan.

‘They started performing CPR on him… the pilot got on the air and said we are going to have an emergency landing.’

‘We were on the ground in five minutes... I think that they did everything they could to save that boy’s life,' Ryan added.

A registered nurse aboard a flight, Dan Goslin, told WSBTV that he and two other passengers, a doctor and a midwife, did everything they could to revive the boy.

'He was having trouble breathing. We tried oxygen. That didn't work. We tried to move him out of the chair and get him to another position. That didn't work and everything we tried just really didn't work,' Goslin said.

Emergency personnel were already on their way when the plane touched down.

‘We met them on the ground with our fire fighter paramedics and attempted resuscitate him for well over 30 minutes,’ Schaeffer said.

‘Paramedics rushed on to the plane, you could tell there was a lot of urgency… then everything calmed down and you could put two and two together,’ Ryan lamented.

The boy was pronounced dead on the plane.
