A rocket carrying an Earth observation satellite has blasted off from the California coast today on a mission to keep a continuous eye on the planet's resources.

The Atlas V rocket launched at 1.02pm EST (6.02pm GMT) from the Vandenberg Air Force Base along California's central coast.

NASA said the protective nose cone around the Landsat satellite had separated and fallen away from the rocket as planned.

The Landsat satellite is the eighth of its kind to be launched since 1972 to track glaciers, forest fires, crop production and coastlines.

Waiting: The countdown for the Atlas V launch began this morning from the Vandenberg Air Force Base along California's central coast

Data: LDCM will join the aging Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 satellites in orbit and continue to produce stunning pictures of Earth's surface along with a wealth of scientific data

Unlike its predecessors, the latest carries more powerful sensors and can return more images.

A NASA spokesman said: 'The Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) is the future of Landsat satellites. It will continue to obtain valuable data and imagery to be used in agriculture, education, business, science, and government.'

Preparations: A rocket carrying an Earth observation satellite is scheduled to blast off from the California coast today on a mission to keep a continuous eye on the planet's resources

Vital: A NASA spokesman said: 'The Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) is the future of Landsat satellites. It will continue to obtain valuable data and imagery'

Preparations: A truck moves the first stage booster of a United Launch Alliance Atlas V to Space Launch Complex-3E at Vandenberg Air Force Base in October

LDCM will measure Earth’s surfaces in
the visible, near-infrared, short wave infrared and thermal infrared, 
with a moderate-resolution of 15 to 100 meters, depending on spectral 
frequency.

For four 
decades, Nasa's Landsat satellites have looked down on Earth - 
monitoring natural disasters, watching cities such as Beijing expand and
watching resources such as water.

The
satellites images have provided critical data on human population 
growth and changes in the planet, including the first 'full' images of 
Antarctica.

Record: NASA¿s Earth-observing Landsat fleet has the longest unbroken data stream of Earth¿s surface as seen from space

The camera takes pictures in 
visible light and infrared, and 'cuts out' clouds to provide a complete 
library of pictures of Earth.

Last
year Nasa said, 'This continues the Landsat program’s critical role in 
monitoring, understanding and managing the resources needed for human 
sustainment such as food, water and forests.

'As
our population surpasses seven billion people, the impact of human 
society on the planet will increase, and Landsat monitors those impacts 
as well as environmental changes.'

With
the longest unbroken data stream of Earth’s surface as seen from space,
NASA’s Earth-observing Landsat fleet has provided the world with 
unprecedented information on land cover changes and their residual 
effects since 1972.

The $855 million mission is managed by NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey.
