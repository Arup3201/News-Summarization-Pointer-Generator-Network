Victim: Clifford Collinge died after suffering 46 separate injuries in the attack

A cheating wife had her wealthy husband killed by three men before stepping over his dying body to collect her drugs, a court heard.

Charlotte Collinge, 44, is accused of recruiting the men to kill her husband Clifford, 61, with a 4ft-long iron clamp.

The court heard she recruited Stephen Shreeves, 40, Robert Proud, 36, and Kevin Dale, 27, to attack her former newsagent husband on October 8 last year.

After the brutal beating, which left Clifford with 46 separate injuries including a fractured skull, Collinge allegedly then calmly stepped over his bleeding body to pick up her stash of cannabis.

Peter Joyce QC, prosecuting, said: 'In order to get the cannabis she had to go over or past her husband’s body.'

The court heard that Mr Collinge’s death was caused by a head injury, fractured ribs a collapsed lung and a cardiac air embolism. He had 46 separate, individual or groups of injuries.

Injuries to the back of his head were consistent with the use of a weapon such as a clamp recovered from the couple’s home.

Nottingham Crown Court heard Collinge - described as a sexual exhibitionist - plotted to kill her husband so she would be entitled to their £500,000 home in the village of Market Warsop, Nottinghamshire.

Charlotte Collinge, 44, and the three men she is accused of hiring to kill her husband are all on trial at Nottingham Crown Court

Earlier the court had been told how Shreeves, Dale and Collinge met at a pub in Warsop before buying lager and wine at a shop.

All three, who were later joined by Proud, then went to the couple’s home where Mr Collinge was enjoying an evening with pal Stephen ‘Stan’ Boardman.

Mr Boardman claimed the men were shouting at Clifford Collinge and calling him an offensive name before the alleged attack.

He claims he was then struck on the back of the head before being kicked unconscious by the men.

Mr Joyce added: 'Mr Boardman spoke of being hit on the back of the head, slashed on the wrist and being kicked and stamped on.

'He heard his friend, the deceased, moaning and being dragged into the kitchen area before he lost consciousness.'

Collinge and Shreeves, of Church Warsop, and Dale and Proud, of Warsop, all deny murder. The three men also deny assaulting Mr Boardman.

The trial continues on Monday.
