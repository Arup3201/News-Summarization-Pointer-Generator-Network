Ke$ha's phallic earrings and pendants 
may have sold out already, but the pop star, it appears, is still hoping
for similar success with the rest of her line.

The singer, 26, appears in a new ad campaign for Kesha Rose by Charles Albert collection, images for which were released today.

Showing
a softer, prettier image than her stage persona, Ke$ha is seen posing 
in a cream lace tunic, leaning against a dusty blue vintage car.

Her peroxide blonde hair is worn loose and wavy, and her lipstick is bright red, lending a retro Fifties feel.

In each picture, of course, one can see items from the collection, all made from a fake gold called Alchemia.

But the phallic
'Grow a Pear' pieces - an instant sellout after the August 1st launch -
are curiously absent from the shoot, indicating that even she couldn't 
get her hands on any of it.

Those pendants, earrings and rings are priced between $12 and $20 - but other items hold steeper price tags.

Risque: Phallic jewelry designs, from Ke$ha's Grow a Pear collection, have proved an unlikely sellout. The line includes earrings, $15 (left) a pendant necklace, $24 (center) and a ring, $12 (right)

For the slightly less provocative: rose rings ($60), a teeth charm bracelet ($135) and a spike cuff ($195)

The most expensive piece on offer is a skull necklace at $600.

The
line includes two other collections: Warrior, which features arrowhead 
and shark teeth designs and Cannibal, which is modeled from human teeth -
real human teeth, sent in by fans.

Ke$ha is of course best known for her 'garbage-chic' style.

She told Complex Magazine last year: 'I don't take myself that seriously.'

Indeed: she famously wore a garbage bag to the 2010 MTV Movie Awards.

Those who want to be as much like 
Ke$ha as possible will likely make Cannibal a success too, because she 
herself has worn teeth in the past.

In 2011, she asked her fans via Twitter to send her their teeth.

'I got, like, over 1,000 human teeth,' she told the Huffington Post last year. 'I made it into a bra top, and a headdress, and earrings, and necklaces. I've worn it out!'

Now fans can do the same.
