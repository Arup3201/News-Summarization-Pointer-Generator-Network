Jose Mourinho has been charged with misconduct by the Football Association for his public comments after Chelsea's draw with Southampton in December. 

The charge comes after the Chelsea boss received a formal warning over his pre-match comments ahead of the Stoke game when he spoke of the need for a 'strong referee'.

Mourinho was furious after Cesc Fabregas was booked for diving by referee Anthony Taylor during the 1-1 draw at St Mary's on December 28 when replays showed he had been tripped by Matt Targett.

The Chelsea boss claimed: 'It is a scandal because it is not a small penalty, it is a penalty like Big Ben. It was a big mistake with a big influence on the result.

'I will go to the referee and wish him a good year and tell him he will be ashamed. It is clearly the result of something that looks like a campaign.'

The FA's disciplinary department have taken their time but charged him on Thursday.

An FA statement said: 'Jose Mourinho has been charged by The FA for misconduct in relation to media comments he made following Chelsea's game against Southampton on 28 December 2014.

'It is alleged his remarks constitute improper conduct in that they allege and/or imply bias on the part of a referee or referees and/or bring the game into disrepute.

'He has until 6pm on 13 January 2015 to respond to the charge. Mourinho was scheduled to appear at Chelsea's Friday press conference, but the club have confirmed that assistant coach Steve Holland will now front the media briefing.

'The FA has also reviewed pre-match comments made by Mr Mourinho on December 19 2014 prior to Chelsea's game against Stoke City and, having sought his observations on this matter, decided not to bring a disciplinary charge and instead issued him with a formal warning.

'The FA prohibit participants from making any pre-match media comments including comments of a positive nature concerning the appointed match officials for a particular fixture. Whether the official is identifiable by name or by implication, these are deemed to amount to improper conduct in breach of FA Rule E3.'

Mourinho was in trouble with the FA twice last season. Once for entering the field at Aston Villa and also for a sarcastic post-match rant about referees’ boss Mike Riley after a home defeat against Sunderland, which earned the Chelsea boss a £10,000 fine.

His comments about a campaign related to a previous game against Hull, when Oscar and Diego Costa were booked for diving, although Gary Cahill escaped a caution for a blatant dive as he tried to win a penalty.
