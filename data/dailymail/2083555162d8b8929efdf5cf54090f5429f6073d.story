Craig Carth, 27, was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm after he punched a four-year-old girl in her stomach

A man who punched a four-year-old girl so hard he ripped holes in her intestine and left her fighting for her life in intensive care has been jailed for 13 years.

Craig Carth, 27, from south-west London, was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm after an investigation established the girl's injury was the result of a blow to her stomach.

The four-year-old was rushed to St George's Hospital in Tooting after her mother called 999 in March 2013 to say she had been vomiting, Kingston Crown Court heard.

During surgery she was found to have two holes in the front wall of the intestine.

The attack was believed to have taken place at some point in the 48 hours before she was taken to hospital.

She remained in intensive care for several days but has since made a full recovery.

Carth was arrested, along with another man and two women, but he was not charged until February this year.

The three other defendants were found not guilty of causing or allowing the serious harm of a young child. 

Detective Sergeant Tariq Farooqi, of Wandsworth Child Abuse Investigation Team, said: 'This is a substantial sentence and I am pleased that Carth will now be in prison for a significant amount of time. I'm glad that the weight of evidence helped the jury come to a unanimous finding of guilt against Carth.

'Had it not been for the excellence of the consultant paediatric surgeon and staff at St George's Hospital, this young girl may well have died. Thankfully she has made a full recovery.

'Officers from the Child Abuse Investigation Team conducted a thorough investigation, dealing with a very young, vulnerable child. 

'We will continue to investigate every allegation of child abuse professionally in order to bring this type of dangerous offender to justice.'
