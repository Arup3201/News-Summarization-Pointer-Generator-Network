A doctor who has been treating victims of Ebola in Africa says the sheer number of those affected and the fear it instilled in people was shocking and 'quite alarming'.

Dr Jenny Stedmon returned to her Brisbane home last week after spending a harrowing month as a specialist volunteer with the Red Cross in a tent-based facility in Kanama, Sierra Leone.

The 55-year-old anaesthetist, who is now in quarantine for 21 days, helped set up a new Ebola isolation facility to help ease pressure on the hugely overcrowded hospitals.

Dr Jenny Stedmon returned to her Brisbane home last week after spending a harrowing month as a specialist volunteer with the Red Cross in Kanama, Sierra Leone

Dr Stedmon, pictured left organising clothes for patients, watched 70 per cent of her patients die due in part to a lack of intensive care facilities and even basic sanitation

'I'm an anaesthetist used to working with very high tech equipment. In Africa I was giving very basic care and that's all you're able to do,' Dr Stedmon told Daily Mail Australia.

'You're not able to give intensive care treatment, the most you can do is give them fluids. You can't put people on life support. 

'The situation was overwhelming from the local health point of view and it was quite alarming.

About 70 percent of the patients she attended to died from the disease. 

'I see a lot of sick people but there's just something about Ebola... You can tell who has it, they just get this distinctive look that's almost indescribable,' she said. 

'It's something about the way they move. In the latest stage of the disease it starts to effect their state of mind and you could just see they were struggling mentally.'

She said the 'space suits' shown in the media that were worn by health care workers was a reality but it made working conditions incredibly difficult.

'We were wearing the protective equipment dealing with the patients but it was very hot, the temperatures were very, very high.

'It was definitely exhausting.'

Judging by her first-hand experience, Dr Stedmon said controlling the disease wouldn't happen any time soon unless more resources were injected into Africa.

'It's expensive and resource consuming to monitor people 24 hours a day. If they could get the resources and health care workers we could stop it spreading there,' she said.

Judging by her first-hand experience, Dr Stedmon said controlling the disease wouldn't happen any time soon unless more resources were injected into Africa

'I fear that people are just going to try and protect their own country but it's not going to spread in a first world country. Everyone on an international scale needs to concentrate on Africa. 

'It's such an easy virus to kill - any soap and water, alcohol wipes and chlorine will kill it. But Africa just don't have the capacity to get on top of it. It spreads easily because they don't have sanitation.'

The doctor said even though the thought of contracting the deadly disease had entered her mind, she said her month-long stint was rewarding because of the survivors. 

Dr Stedmon, who has worked with the Red Cross in war zones across the world, said the working conditions on Africa were quite hard 

As an anaesthetist in Brisbane, Dr Stedmon said she was used to working with very high tech equipment. But in Africa she was only able to administer very basic care because of the conditions and equipment

'One of the first patients into the new centre we set up was an 11-year-old girl who came in on her own... you could imagine how scary that would have been for her,' Dr Stedmon said.

'She was quite unwell, but over a week she got better and better every day. I don't know if she's out yet, but I'm pretty sure she was going to survive. We don't know if any of her family survived. 

'A lot of people's families have been destroyed. It's not clear what they'll be sent back to if they survive. There's a lot of resistance for people in remote villages to accept people back who have had Ebola.'

She said the 'space suits' shown in the media that were worn by health care workers was a reality but it made working conditions incredibly difficult

Dr Stedmon will now be quarantined for 21 days and is banned from touching people in case the protective suit wasn't enough. 

'Health care workers were getting infected while I was there, it's not like I wasn't unaware if was happening.

'But in saying that there were measures the Red Cross instilled in us to ensure we looked out for each other.'

Africa does not have the capacity to control the disease without much more help from overseas, she said
