Missing: Teenager Shelley Pratt, 14, disappeared three weeks ago

The parents of a missing schoolgirl have made a desperate plea for help to find their daughter who disappeared three weeks ago.

Shelley Pratt, 14, was last seen getting off a bus outside the Harris Academy in South Norwood, south London, on November 8.

She hasn't contact any family members or friends since that date and fears are growing for the teenager's safety.

Her parents Lisa and Tony Pratt today made a direct appeal to their daughter to come home, saying: 'Shellz, you’re not in trouble. We love you and we miss you. Your 
brothers and sisters are missing you like mad.'

Her parents told how Shelley - one of six children - went missing for three days last year but was 
found at a 19-year-old man’s home.

Police believe she is currently with somebody in a building, house or flat.

Mrs
Pratt, who fears her daughter is being held captive against her will, said: 'I just want to know if she is safe. Is she sleeping, eating, got a spare change of clothes?

'My
instinct tells me someone has got her and is not letting her go. My gut
feeling is saying she has got herself into a situation which she can’t 
get out of it.'

Mr Pratt added that their daughter is a vulnerable teenager who is susceptible to anyone who pays her attention.

Last sighting: Shelley was last seen on November 8 outside the Harris Academy in South Norwood, London

He said: 'Whenever anyone showed her any attention, she loved them. She's very vulnerable but she's strong-minded and she's strong as an ox.

'I've been out every night on my bike looking for her, whether it’s snowing or raining I’m there.

Appeal: Police are asking anyone with any information about Shelley's whereabouts to come forward

'She loves Christmas, she’d never miss it. We just want her home.'

She was last seen wearing her school uniform 
trousers and a distinctive dark purple hooded jumper with the slogan ‘I 
love (heart symbol) London’.

Police added that Shelley's Oyster Card was used a few hours after she was last 
seen, on November 8, but it was unclear if it was her using it or 
someone else.

Detective Chief Inspector Mark Dunne said: 'It has now been three weeks since Shelley went missing and concerns for her safety are understandably increasing by the day.

'It is possible that Shelley may be with someone, perhaps in a house or a flat. I am encouraging people, particularly Croydon residents, to be "nosey neighbours" and be extra vigilant as to the movements of any young people who are new to the area.'

A photo of Shelley will be displayed on 
the big screen at Crystal Palace’s home game against Brighton to try and
encourage people to come forward with information.

Police officers will also hand out appeal leaflets to shoppers in the vicinity of Croydon town centre over the weekend.
