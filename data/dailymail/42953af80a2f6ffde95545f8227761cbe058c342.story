These shocking pictures show the inside of a squalid drug den littered with needles and packs of methadone in the Cornish town where Poldark is set.

The disgusting images of a flat in Bodmin were taken after a woman and her boyfriend were evicted, leaving behind drug paraphernalia, condoms and piles of rubbish.

The state of the property paints a darker picture of a town better known for being where the 18th century historical romance was set.

Crisp packets, empty fizzy drinks cans and plastic bags litter the floors of the squalid flat in the Cornish town

Bodmin, also known for its legendary beast, was where Poldark was set during its 1970s television adaptation

The grim photographs show debris piled up against the walls, with the floors of the heroin and crack cocaine den covered in needles, mouldy food and cigarette butts.

The popular 1970s adaptations of the Poldark novels were set in the town, and a new BBC series based on the romantic novels was also filmed on Bodmin Moor.

The first seven novels, set in the 18th centuries, tell the story of a Ross Poldark, a British Army officer who returns from the American Revolutionary War to find his fiancee, presuming he was dead, about to marry his cousin.

The next five books focus on the children of the main characters and is largely set in the 19th century.

Widely considered to be the one of the most successful television adaptations, Poldark is set to return to the BBC on Sunday with a new series.

Many will be hoping the series encourages more tourists to the town, but the photographs from inside the drug den show it is not idyllic as the television programme makes it appear.

The landlord of the two-bedroom flat evicted the tenants after discovering the state of the propert

Despite obvious drug use in the house, police did not arrest the tenants after they were kicked out

The new series, which starts on Sunday and features Aiden Turner and Eleanor Tomlinson, was also filmed on Bodmin Moor

The two-bedroom flat's landlord Charlie Besenyi, 77, called the police after evicting the pair but was told that officers would not be able to help any further. 

He said: 'It was disgusting. I had never seen anything like it in my life. I was a good Samaritan and tried to help this woman who was living on the streets and she gave me a £125 a week through housing benefit.

'She stayed for five months with her boyfriend and the flat turned into a drug supermarket. There were always coming and goings and I knew something dodgy was going on.

'I have lived in Bodmin for 40 years and Cornwall is a beautiful place and I love it here. But it does have a darker side and a big problem with drugs that people on the outside probably don't realise.

'Show like Poldark show off Cornwall in a fantastic light which is good for the area. But what has happened here proves that the reality is somewhat different.

'I think this would shock a lot of people, which think of Cornwall as what they see on the television. Bodmin is full of druggies.' 

Kitchen surfaces were found smeared with grease inside the flat in Bodmin, which is tackling a drug problem

The landlord said Bodmin has a recognised drug problem and that dealers regularly target the town

Dirty clothes were piled up against the walls alongside rubbish, overflowing bins and unwashed pans

Shocking: One of the windows of the flat was smashed when the landlord evicted his tenants

'After I evicted this woman and her boyfriend I opened the door and I was shocked. They ripped up everything and there was stuff everywhere. It has been disastrous.'

There were more than 60 crimes involving drugs in Bodmin in the last year, as well as more than 700 anti-social behaviour offences and nearly 200 reports of criminal damage.

A spokesman for tourist board Visit Cornwall said: 'Everywhere has its issues and there are always two sides to every story but Cornwall is incredibly beautiful with a stunning natural landscape and this is showcased wonderfully in the Poldark adaptation.

'The series is expected to offer Cornwall a real boost in terms of tourism which will provide a positive impact on the local economy.'
