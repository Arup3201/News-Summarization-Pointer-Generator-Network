It looked like spring had come early for British tennis in mid-February, the spirits buoyed above all by an away Davis Cup victory over the USA which put GB in the World Group quarter final for the first time in 28 years.

Andy Murray looking on the mend following back surgery, Heather Watson returning, Dan Evans seemingly poised for the top 100, a new man at the helm of the Lawn Tennis Association – revival was in the air.

Yet this US Open has been a reminder that tennis in Wimbledon’s host nation rarely takes two steps forward without taking at least one and a half back. Murray has reached the last 16, but there were no qualifiers, the country’s two female entrants failed to win a set while Laura Robson – unbeknown in February - is likely to miss the rest of the season as she works her way back from wrist surgery.

Disappointment: Heather Watson was knocked out in the first round of the US Open at Flushing Meadows

The men’s doubles players, a source of low-key success for the past few years, failed to win a match between them. With poignant timing it emerged that Oliver Golding, junior winner at Flushing Meadows just three years ago, is considering his future in the game.

Now there are big changes afoot at the LTA, going well beyond the recently-announced shift of emphasis to the National Tennis Centre at Roehampton, which will become more a junior training base and less of a centre for elite training squads.

According to one insider at the governing body, ‘everything is up in the air’, with coaches being warned that they need to have a ‘Plan B’ in case they are released. Some staff are being told to reapply for their jobs while others are being made redundant.

Employees in the regions are fearful too, as the axe is set to be wielded on many of the 19 ‘High Performance Centres’ which for so long have failed to live up to their titles. Morale is said to have reached a new low.

Canadian Michael Downey is now, in earnest, starting the changes he promised since taking over from Roger Draper, who grew the organisation to more than 300 employees but with little to show for it in terms of participation or elite performance.

Draper got many things wrong, although it has been incorrectly reported that he is to blame for the £40 million blown on building Roehampton, which he had the foresight to oppose.

He also spotted the potential in Leon Smith as Davis Cup Captain, but Downey is now trying to reverse many of his more damaging strategies, aided by veteran Australian coaching guru Bob Brett, who has been brought in as Player Development Director.

Downey and Brett worked together when the former ran Tennis Canada and are both proper grown-ups at 57 and 61. Although they have affable exteriors they have already shown a ruthlessness that, while inevitably painful for some, is probably necessary to try and turn around a sport that has been underachieving for decades, despite the odd spell of optimism such as last February.

Brett, with a huge list of individual coaching credits to his name such as Boris Becker, is a formidable taskmaster and will demand the highest standards.

It will be fascinating to see how he views players like Evans, who has genuine talent but struggles to come to terms with the demands of the modern game.

Evans, who will be back down below 250 after losing in qualifying here, has gone in and out of the LTA giant tent over the years and is a reluctant traveller. There has been a desperation to provide assistance to help keep players like him going, because the alternatives are so sparse and, in his case, he has also put in some fine performances for the Davis Cup team.

The fact is that come a week on Monday the only British male within a country mile of Murray will be James Ward, who has had a good season to get within sight of the top 100, and more definitive decisions may be taken on whether to maintain support for other players.

On a similar theme Brett also has to weigh up the policy on wildcards at British tournaments, which for so many years have been distributed with little coherent strategy. The effect has sometimes been to temporarily inflate home players’ rankings, but some international research suggests they are counterproductive in the long run.

Arguably more worrying is the lack of obvious male prospects in the GB junior ranks, which is highlighted again in this week’s event for under-18s at the US Open. Talent identification systems are another area rightly under examination.

The in-trays of Downey and Brett overflow, with some of their remedies for the long-term malaise expected to be more solidly outlined in the next two months. Another development to look out for is the possible switch to British nationality of Aljaz Bedene, the longtime Hertfordshire-based Slovenian ranked 133.

But it is only more success with the home-grown players that can prevent another US Open like this one.
