Low-cost airline easyJet begins airing its first television advertisements aimed at business travellers tomorrow. 

The adverts are part of the carrier's £8.5 million 'Business Sense' campaign, which celebrates their on-time performance, and will premiere in the UK, said a statement.

Set in a busy airport, the advert features a familiar white rabbit with a pocket watch, who proceeds calmly to an on-time flight amid other, more frantic-looking travelers.

In a chaotic scene, business men and women rush to catch their flights to the soundtrack of 'I'm Late' -the famous Alice in Wonderland song, sung by the white rabbit at the beginning of the Disney film version of Lewis Carroll book.

Soon, the audience are introduced to an individual reading a business newspaper. Suddenly, two  white ears pop up from behind the paper and the very same white rabbit appears.

The rabbit flips open his pocket watch, looks around at the chaos and calmly makes his way to a punctual flight.

Passengers travelling for business now account for more than a fifth of easyJet's passengers with more than 12m choosing the airline every year.

The ads will also be rolled out in print, outdoor and digital in France, Germany and Portugal as well as the UK.

EasyJet is competing with its arch rival Ryanair for lucrative business travel.

The airline has introduced flexible tickets, allocated seats, fast-track boarding and higher frequencies to boost its business-friendly credentials, prompting Ryanair to examine similar benefits.

'This is the first time we have chosen to advertise to business travelers on TV and it is indicative of the importance we place on this key and growing market for us,' EasyJet Commercial Director Peter Duffy said in the statement.

In June, the airline said it plans to spend 20 per cent of its marketing budget on campaigns aimed at business-travel market.
