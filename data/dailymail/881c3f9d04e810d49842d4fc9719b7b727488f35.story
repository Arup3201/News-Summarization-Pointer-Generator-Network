Oxford Street murder victim Seydou Diarrassouba was due to stand trial accused of robbing a 16-year-old boy of his BlackBerry mobile phone, it emerged today.

The 18-year-old appeared at Inner London Crown Court just a week before he was stabbed to death during the Boxing Day sales.

It was alleged he robbed and assaulted Nile Downes in Clapham, South London, and assaulted Nile's brother Yafeu on September 29, the CPS has confirmed.

He was released on bail and was due to stand trial in the New Year. If convicted, he faced a tougher sentence because of Nile's age.

Seydou was knifed in the heart after a fight broke out between rival gangs in a trainer store.

He was a member of the notorious London street gang ABM, which stands for ‘All ’Bout Money’, and the killer was believed to have been involved with the rival 031 Bloods.

Territorial clashes between the two South London gangs have claimed several lives since 2007.

On YouTube, the victim appears in a 
homemade rap video in which he talks about guns and killing.

Sealed off: Crowds who swarmed the crime scene yesterday were today kept at a distance by police as investigations continued

Patrols: A red police car passes by the branch of Foot Locker where the attack took place as police continued to comb the scene for clues

On Boxing Day he is believed to have 
left his home on a council estate in Mitcham, South London, with other 
members of ABM but the gang ran into their rivals 
and violence that is usually restricted to deprived areas of London 
boiled over in front of crowds of shoppers, tourists and families.

Sportswear store Foot Locker became the battleground when the college 
student was knifed through the heart before staggering outside and 
collapsing in a pool of blood.

Paramedics battled to save him  as 
crowds of spectators filming the incident on mobile phones pushed 
against police, trying to get a better view of  the dying boy.

He died at the scene at around 1.45pm, the latest victim of London’s senseless gang violence. 
Just hours later, a second man aged 21 was stabbed in the leg on the 
same street in what is believed to be a separate and unrelated attack.

Last night detectives were examining 
hours of CCTV footage from around the West End to establish whether 
there may have been a confrontation earlier in the day between the two 
gangs.

Officers were also looking at video 
from a number of stores in Oxford Street to work out the victim’s 
movements in the hours before the stabbing, as well as examining reports
of thefts in the area.

Police said the trigger for the fight
remained unclear, although there were reports that a row broke out over
which trainers to steal from the shop.

Last night details emerged about how Diarrassouba was sucked into the violent world of gang warfare.

Born in Merton, south London, in 1993
to Muslim parents who came to Britain from the Ivory Coast in West 
Africa, he was the youngest of three.

Friends said Diarrassouba was one of 
the ‘bright kids’ at Rutlish High School in Merton, before attending 
South Thames College. His family, who live in a rundown tower-block on 
the outskirts of Mitcham, south London, were last night too devastated 
to speak.

But a series of disturbing images and
videos seen by  the Daily Mail reveal the  teenager glorifying violence
and smoking what appears to be a ‘blunt’ – slang for a rolled up 
cigarette containing cannabis.

Known by the nicknames ‘Nutz’ and ‘TunaRaw’, he was an active gang member for at least two years.

Many teenagers who lived near him would avoid him, aware he was part of the ABM gang and could be armed.

Earlier this month, one  teenager said he had witnessed Diarrassouba and
a fellow  gang member attack another group of boys at a house party in
Croydon, simply because they were from an opposing faction.

The three victims of the assault were left with bloodied lips and bruised faces.

One associate said: ‘He may well pretend to be an angel at home, but 
he’s hardly going to go home and threaten his mother. Seydou was a 
completely different person when he was with his friends, but that’s 
gang life.

‘Around other members  he was a bubbly character,  but not when he came across his enemies. That was a  different story.

‘You certainly couldn’t trust him. He had a cold and ruthless side to 
him, and could turn on you in an instant if you were not one of his 
own.’

Eleven people - including a boy of 16 - have been arrested in connection
with the murder, but police are still trying to trace a number of those
involved in the attack.

All 11 have been released on bail and will return to London police stations in mid-January.

Investigation: Part of the road was cordoned off on one of the busiest shopping days of the year after the stabbing

Shock: Police stand guard over a blood-soaked item of clothing and belongings of a second person stabbed on Oxford Street yesterday

Probe: A forensics officers moves the victims belongings, including trainers, clothing and an Oyster card, into a bag for examination following the stabbing
