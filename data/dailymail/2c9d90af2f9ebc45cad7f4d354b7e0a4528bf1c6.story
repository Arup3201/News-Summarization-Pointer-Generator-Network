In his new movie Fury, Brad Pitt plays the commander of a DD Sherman tank in the Second World War and for advice while filming in Hertfordshire last year, he turned to Peter Comfort, 91, the last Second World War survivor of the 13/18th Royal Hussars who was assigned to the Sherman tanks at just 21-years-old.

To repay Mr Comfort for his expertise, Pitt accompanied the war hero to the London Film Festival gala screening of the film on Sunday night, where they walked the red carpet together.

Pitt laughed and joked with Mr Comfort as they posed for pictures at the Battersea Evolution, alongside his co-stars including Shia LaBeouf.

Pitt had invited Mr Comfort to the set of the new blockbuster in Hertfordshire to hear a first-hand account of life inside an amphibious Sherman tank.

Mr Comfort went to meet him and left the film crew laughing when he admitted he had to check out who Pitt was on the internet first.

He said: ‘Mr Pitt was very friendly and charming actually but I didn't know who he was.

Close pals: While the duo chatted up a storm on the red carpet, Mr Comfort previously revealed he had to google the actor to find out who he was

‘I said to him "Until last night I didn't have a clue who you were and then I googled you and you've been in quite a lot of films'.

‘They all rolled about laughing when I said that.

‘I don't do modern films. I am a fan of actors like Alec Guinness, but of course he is dead now.’

Mr Comfort, one of the last Second World War survivors of the 13/18th Royal Hussars, was assigned to the Sherman tanks at just 21-years-old.

He landed at Sword beach on D-Day, June 6, 1944 with the tanks going into the water 500 yards from the shore, something the Germans had not seen before.

By the end of that day 140 of his colleagues were killed and 350 more were wounded.

In the new wartime thriller, Pitt plays the commander of a DD Sherman tank.

Mr Comfort, from Ripple, near Dover, Kent, said: ‘My regiment, the Light Dragoons, got in contact with me about three weeks ago.

'They'd been approached by an ex-officer who worked for a film company and asked if there were any old boys left.

Date night: Guy Ritchie and wife Jackie Ainsley showed up to support Pitt 

‘Then Brad Pitt phoned me and said he wanted to speak about Sherman tanks for a film.

‘He talked me into going and, I have to say, I was extremely well treated.

‘They wanted a lot of information to make it accurate and fired a lot of questions at me.

‘Luckily there weren't any questions I didn't know the answer to. 

‘The film crew got me up on the tank for a few pictures and wanted to know everything about it.

Father/daughter outing: Terry Gilliam and his daughter Amy Gilliam also attended the party

‘They wanted to know where we slept, where we spent a penny, the living conditions and what it was like in action, so I told them.

‘I don't like to talk about it because I saw too many people killed but Mr Pitt was very nice and I will be interested to see the film.’ 

Recalling his experiences in Normandy, Mr Comfort said: ‘I don’t like to talk about it because I saw too many people killed. But Mr Pitt was very nice and I will be interested to see the film.’

Doing his thing: The actor took to the stage inside the venue with the rest of his co-stars 

Speaking out: Brad took to the microphone as he addressed his delighted fans who had come to see the movie 

Hey there! Brad cut a smart figure as he left the venue later that evening

The M4 Sherman was the primary battle tank used by the US in the Second World War. Thousands were used by Britain, replacing its own unreliable and obsolete designs.

The Duplex Drive variant – nicknamed ‘Donald Duck tanks’ – could enter the water 500 yards from the shore.

LaBeouf said Brad Pitt was known as 'Top Dog' on set and everyone was 'vying for his attention'
