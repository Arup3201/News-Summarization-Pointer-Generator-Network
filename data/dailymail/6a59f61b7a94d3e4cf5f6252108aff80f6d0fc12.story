Humans might admire the peacock’s tall tail feathers displaying colourful iridescent eyespots but amorous peahens aren't so impressed and lower their gaze when sizing up a male.

The females are naturally drawn to the males' legs as researchers think a peacock’s dancing skills could mark him out as an ideal partner.

U.S. scientists used eye-tracking technology and small cameras mounted on a customised peahen hat to work out how the female birds pick their perfect partner.

U.S. scientists used eye-tracking technology and little cameras mounted on a customised peahen hat to work out how the female birds pick their perfect partner - and this visual shows that they look at peacocks' legs and not their display of feathers

Jessica Yorzinski, a postdoctoral fellow at Purdue University’s Department of Biological Sciences, said: ‘Surprisingly, the peahens are looking at the lowest edge of tail feathers and aren't paying much attention to the rest of the five-foot tall displays.’

‘According to our study, the females' gaze rarely fell at or above the peacocks' heads.

‘Of the small portion of time spent looking at the males, females looked longest at the legs and lower portion of the train,’ she said.

The peacocks have a hard time trying to keep a peahen’s attention as she is constantly on the lookout for food and predators, so males have to rely on some fancy footwork.

‘What garnered the most attention from the peahens was when the peacocks would turn around and shake their wings and rattle their tails during the courtship dance, Dr Yorzinski said.

‘It seems that mastering certain dance moves is important for peacocks,’ she added.

Her study of 12 peahens, which was published in the Journal of Experimental Biology, followed their gaze in the presence of multiple males vying for attention during the mating season, but did not evaluate which males won a mate.

Dr Yorzinski is now looking at the results of another experiment that tracked what peacocks watch when looking for a mate.

She believes that understanding the birds’ perception could lead to improvements in the protection of endangered species.

Dr Yorzinski began the experiments at Duke University and is now continuing her research at Purdue.
