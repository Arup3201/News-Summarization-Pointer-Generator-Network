A website designed for guests to buy gifts stated that their ceremony took place on May 31.  

The school district said in a statement: 'The Tuscaloosa City School System learned of these allegations Tuesday, January 6, at which time an investigation was immediately conducted by both the Tuscaloosa Police Department and Tuscaloosa City School officials.

'The following day, January 7, the Board of Education accepted the resignation of the teacher involved. ' 

Acker was taken to the Tuscaloosa County Jail, where her bond was set at $5,000.
