Could this be China’s answer to the iPhone?

Chinese smartphone manufacturer, Xiaomi, has launched two new smartphones – the Xiaomi Mi-S2 and the Xiaomi Mi-2A.

The company, which is rapidly gaining a reputation for being the Apple of the East, is hoping that the new phones will cause frenzy amongst technology enthusiasts.

Xiaomi's CEO Lei Jun launched the Mi-2A and Mi-2S yesterday

The Xiaomi Mi-2S has a quad-core 1.7GHz Snapdragon 600 processor and a 4.3ins screen with 1280 x 720 pixel resolution.

It also has a 13 megapixel rear-facing camera and a 200mAh battery.

Finally, it features 2GB of RAM and 16 or 32GB of on board storage.

The Mi-2A also boasts Near Frequency Communication technology which means it can be used to exchange contact details or even to pay for small items.

It can also support 5G WiFi and has a dual-core 1.7GHz Snapdragon S4 PRO processor as well as a rear-facing eight megapixel camera and a two megapixel front-facing camera.

As with its sister phone, the Mi-2A has a 4.3ins screen but this one only has 1GB of RAM along with 16GB of storage.

For
 the new phones, Xiaomi has updated its interface and it has created a 
function whereby the camera will take a picture when the owner says 
‘cheese’.

The company hopes that their new phones will help them break into the western market
