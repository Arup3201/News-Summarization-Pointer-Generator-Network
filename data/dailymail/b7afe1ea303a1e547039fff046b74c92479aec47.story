France's former first lady reportedly came to blows with another woman she saw chatting to Francois Hollande's friends in a Paris bar.

Guests at the private party looked on in shock as Valerie Trierweiler 'scratched and pulled the hair' of her 'treacherous' former friend, Valerie de Senneville.

The pair were attending the wedding anniversary party of their mutual friend, politician Jean-Luc Romero, when the scuffle erupted in the Banana Cafe on September 28.

Miss Trierweiler – nicknamed 'the rottweiler' – had spotted Miss de Senneville talking to friends of President Hollande, who she felt had abandoned her after she was dumped for actress Julie Gayet last year.

The former first lady challenged Miss de Senneville and the two attacked each other in front of dozens of people, the magazine France-Dimanche reported.

It said Miss Trierweiler 'scratched her with one hand and pulled her hair with the other', before fellow guests managed to break up the fight.

Miss de Senneville was later persuaded not to bring legal action for assault against the president's former girlfriend, the magazine said.

The two women became friends more than 20 years ago, as they both launched careers as political journalists in Paris.

Both then went on to be linked to high-flying socialist politicians, with Miss Trierweiler becoming close friends with Mr Hollande ten years ago, and Miss de Senneville meeting party activist Michel Sapin in 2010.

When Miss de Senneville married Mr Sapin in 2011, Mr Hollande was best man at their wedding. After becoming president a year later, he appointed Mr Sapin as his finance minister.

When Mr Hollande's affair was revealed, Miss de Senneville consoled the former first lady during a holiday in Mauritius.

Miss Trierweiler, 49, has angered the French Socialist party in recent weeks after publishing a tell-all memoir, in which she claims the president 'does not like poor people' and refers to them as 'the toothless'. It also tells how she tried to overdose on sleeping pills when she learned of his trysts with film star Miss Gayet, 42.

Embittered Miss Trierweiler wrote about her boyfriend of nine years: 'He portrays himself as a man who doesn't like the rich. But in reality, the president does not like poor people. He, a man of the Left, says in private 'les sans-dents' [the toothless] and he is very proud of his humour.'

She reportedly received an advance of more than £70,000 for the memoir, which is entitled Thank You For This Moment.

French newspaper Le Parisien said Mr Hollande had not been aware of Miss Trierweiler's book and he was 'dismayed' to hear it had been published.

Miss Trierweiler learned of the president's affair with Miss Gayet after he was pictured being dropped off at her home on a motorbike. It was claimed she flew into such a rage that she smashed up his office – causing £2.5million worth of damage.
