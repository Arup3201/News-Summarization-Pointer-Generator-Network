Christmas dinner can be a stressful affair, as thousands of amateur cooks across the country attempt to perfect the festive roast.

So why not simplify things by popping one of these Christmas dinner pies in the oven on the big day?

Inspired by a traditional pork pie, this mammoth creation contains everything you need for the perfect roast, including potatoes, Brussels sprouts, chipolatas, turkey and even a miniature Christmas pudding in the centre.

Sarah Pettegree, who founded Bray's Pork Pies in Norfolk, has created the Christmas dinner pie

From bottom to top it contains: Cranberry sauce, chipolatas, Brussels sprouts, turkey, carrots, potatoes, parsnips and roasted onions with a Christmas pudding centre

The only thing that needs to be added is gravy as the porky pastry also contains cranberry sauce.

Veteran pie maker Sarah Pettegree came up with the idea after she spent a day filming with famously experimental chef Heston Blumenthal.

She said: 'When I was given a commission to make a one-off pork pie with a full Christmas lunch I was undaunted, and decided to think like Heston.

Brays is famous for its variety of weird creations such as onion marmalade, chilli, chorizo and fig and orange

Sarah says she was inspired to make the pie by famously inventive chef Heston Blumenthal

'This was definitely a one-off for this year, but if there's enough demand we might think about supplying people's full Christmas lunch in a pastry case for next year.

'It would certainly cut down the washing-up time on Christmas day.'

Ms Pettegree is the founder of Bray's Cottage Pork Pies based on the North Norfolk coast and an expert in experimental pork pie creations.

The outside of the pie is made from a traditional hot water crust pastry while the pudding is covered with suet

For those looking for a hassle-free Christmas morning, or to cut down on washing up, this pie is ideal

The company are famous for their unusual approach to pork pies and sell their varieties including onion marmalade, chilli, chorizo and fig and orange, in delis and pubs across the UK.

In the past Sarah has made one-off pork pies with fabulously luxurious black truffles, is regularly found making wedding pork pies and has even made a big UK shaped pork pie.
