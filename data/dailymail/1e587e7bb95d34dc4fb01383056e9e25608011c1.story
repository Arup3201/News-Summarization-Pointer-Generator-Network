The flamboyant Essex boy, 24, broke down in tears after beating Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt, aka Speidi, on the reality show on Friday night.

Although he's been the bookies' favourite for weeks, Rylan was stunned to win and broke down in tears after learning he had beaten his arch-rivals.

Speaking to host Brian Dowling, he said:
 'Honestly, through the past year, people have been picking up the phone
 for me and I really appreciate it.

'They (the public) hated me three months ago. I've been the biggest fan of Big Brother.'

Speaking about his nemesis Speidi, he said: 'I don't have any ties to Heidi and Spencer, but they're a genuine couple. I wish them the best of luck in life. They are absolutely made for each other.

Oh my God! Drop me out! Rylan is stunned as he exits the Big Brother house

'The reason I came on this show is to show people who got me wrong. You can call me whatever you want, but don't ever call me fake.

'One thing they (Speidi) gave me in the house was a headache.

'I'm glad for my mother's sake because when I was on X Factor, she went through hell.'

Second place: Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt, known as Speidi, counted as one housemate

Did Rylan deserve to win Celebrity Big Brother?

Rylan was brought to tears again when he received a phonecall from his mother Linda, who told her son how 'proud' the family were of him.

Earlier during the live show following his eviction, former The Hills reality star Spencer admitted he and his wife didn't appear on the show to win any friends.

Heidi maintained all the contestants 
were on the series to win: 'It's just a game. I didn't think people took
 it seriously. You're supposed to be trying to win.'

Earlier in the show, Australian actor
 Ryan Moloney ended up in third place, Claire Richards in fourth place 
and Neil 'Razor' Ruddock in fifth.

The Aussie star said: 'I thought I would be the first out. I didn't think I was as interesting as everyone else.'

He mocked Heidi and Spencer, saying: 
'According to Speidi, they had it the most difficult. They had each 
other. I had nobody. I think they're a pack of whingers actually.

'If they're here to be baddies, they're doing a good job.'

Meanwhile, former Steps singer Claire, 35, said she was 'overwhelmed' by the crowd response to her exit.

She admitted she was amazed to be in the final: 'I thought I would have quit by now or would have been evicted.

Third place: Neighbours actor Ryan Moloney was the third to be evicted from the Celebrity Big Brother final

She conceded: 'I think I found out I'm a lot tougher than I think I was.'

Reflecting
 on Speidi's delight in not letting her read her letter from home, she said: 'When
 Heidi clapped, I could have gone like that (punched her). That's 
heartless and spiteful.'

During Razor's interview, the 44-year-old insisted he didn't mind not winning: 'My agent told me not to get kicked out - which I nearly did and don't go first, so I'm alright.

Fourth place: Claire Richards was the second person to be voted off during the Celebrity Big Brother final

Curvy: Claire showed off her figure in a tight red dress

'It's like rehab with beer. A lot of boredom. I missed my missus and kids.'

Razor
 admitted women's underwear were more comfortable than boxers when he 
spoke about embracing his 'feminine side' in the house.

Asked about his foul-mouthed argument with Speidi, which resulted in him getting a formal warning from Big Brother.

Reflecting on the clash, he conceded:
 'They're a bunch of f**king idiots. I'm a team player. It got too much.
 When someone bullies someone else, I stepped in and flipped out.'

He
 admitted he couldn't stand Rylan when he was a contestant on X Factor, but now 
describes him as a 'special boy' and urged viewers to vote for the Essex
 boy to win.

Friday's final came after the contestants spent 23 days in Big Brother House - the 11th series of the reality TV show.

Earlier in the episode, the contestants were seen stating their cases for winning the show.

Rylan ended up getting emotional after Ryan suggested the X Factor contestant should win instead of him.

The former Neighbours star said: 'I've had an absolute ball. But there's someone here I would really like everyone to vote for because because it would mean the most too. Please vote for Rylan.'

In recent days, former X Factor star Rylan has been the bookies' favourites, followed by Speidi.

Other contestants to have exited the show over the past two weeks include Paula Hamilton, Frankie Dettori, Gillian Taylforth, Lacey Banghard, Sam Robertson and Tricia Penrose, who all returned for the grand final.

And his win has already been met with excitement from his celebrity fans.

X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos wrote on Twitter: 'YEEEEEESSSSS!!!!!!!!!! @RylanClark!!!!! Woooiiiiii #CelebrityBigBrother.'

And his reality TV star following included Frankie Essex, who wrote: 'Yaayyyyy #Rylan xxxxxx.'
