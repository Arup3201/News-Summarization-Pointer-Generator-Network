Ginia Rinehart, the daughter of Australian mining magnate, Gina, discovered her close friend and minder Jerry Rouwhorst, 35, unconscious and naked on the floor of his suite at the five star Dorchester hotel on March 16

The Australian bodyguard for mining magnate Gina Rinehart's daughter hanged himself in a suite at an exclusive London  hotel after fearing he had 'let her down' by getting drunk in front of her friends, a London coroner's court has been told.

Ginia Rinehart, the daughter of Australia's richest woman, discovered her close friend and minder Jeremiah 'Jerry' Rouwhorst, 35, unconscious and naked on the floor of his suite at the five star Dorchester hotel on March 16.

Hours earlier the 'ashamed' ex-special forces soldier had sent the 27-year-old a text message saying he was going to resign because he felt he had 'disgraced' her in front of her friends by getting drunk the night before.

The pair had spent three months at the Dorchester and Mr Rouwhorst had organised a farewell party for Ms Rinehart before she returned to Australia.

But the normally 'professional' Mr Rouwhorst had consumed an 'uncharacteristic' amount of alcohol, Westminster Coroner's Court heard on Thursday.Â 

'At 10.27 he sent her a text message saying they he felt he had disgraced her, let her down, embarrassed her in front of her friends and he was tendering his resignation,' Assistant Coroner Shirley Radcliffe said.

'It is possible he sent the text message as a possible cry for help and was hoping to be found. I cannot be sure he wanted to kill himself.

'One thinks that this may have been an impulsive gesture whilst under the influence of alcohol. He was devastated at having lost an element of his professionalism the night before.'

The court heard that after the party that had been organised by Mr Rouwhorst, Ms Rinehart went on to spend the rest of the night with friends in Chelsea before calling her bodyguard at 8am on March 16 to pick her up.

She went straight to bed and did not read the text until around midday when she rushed to see him in the adjoining room.

Police officers and paramedics were called to the hotel in London's Park Lane - a favourite with celebrities and where rooms can cost up to $7,000 a night.

Hotel security arrived at the room to find Ms Rinehart 'hysterical' and pointing to where her confidante lay, the court heard.

Constable Aaron King, who attended the scene and spoke to the 27-year-old, said she was very upset.

'She was very distressed and crying on the phone to her mother,' he said.

'She said that because he didn't usually drink that much he was ashamed of how much he had had to drink the night before and he thought that he must have brought shame on her and her friends.'

Mr King explained that he also spoke to Ms Rineharts's mother, Gina, on the phone.

'The mother explained that he is a very professional man and would never drink that much - it was out of character,' he said.

Dr Radcliffe asked if the heiress had given any possible reason why Mr Rouwhorst drank so much.

The officer replied that he didn't really have an opportunity to speak to her in detail, adding: 'She was obviously very distressed and at one point she even collapsed in the hotel corridor.'

Paramedics at the scene were able to revive Mr Rouwhorst and he was taken to St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, west London, but died three days later.

Blood tests at the hospital revealed that he was more than one and half times over the legal drink driving limit.

'This may have been suicide, I cannot be sure. It may have been an accident, I cannot be sure,' Dr Radcliffe said, recording an open verdict.

She recorded the cause of death as ligature compression and noted that he died on March 19, 2014, having been admitted to hospital on March 16.

Just two days before hanging himself Mr Rouwhorst had received a commendation for bravery, having been honoured for saving a man's life during a riot in East Timor in 2007.

After leaving the Australian Special Air Services in 2005, he went on to work as a private security guard for the Australian ambassador in Afghanistan and Iraq, before providing personal security to the Rinehart family, and in particular, Ginia Rinehart.
