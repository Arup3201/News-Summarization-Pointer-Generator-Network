American aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig, whose name was Peter before converting to Islam, was captured by ISIS militants October 1, 2013 while doing humanitarian work in eastern Syria

The parents of American ISIS hostage Abdul-Rahman Kassig have appealed directly to the terror group leader on Twitter, begging him to spare their only son's life.

Ed and Paula Kassig, of Indianapolis, Indiana, reached out to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi over social media this week.

Abdul-Rahman Kassig, 26, whose name was Peter before converting to Islam, was captured by ISIS militants on October 1, 2013 while doing humanitarian work in eastern Syria, CNN reported.

Following the beheading of British hostage Alan Henning in a video released last Friday, Mr Kassig was named by ISIS as their next beheading victim. 

Just one day after the threat to kill the American aid worker was released, the Kassigs posted a video on YouTube reaching out to the terrorists.

They had learned about his abduction and interest in Islam last October from his former colleagues but maintained a one-year silence while they waited for news. 

On Wednesday, the hostage's family posted a message to Twitter pleading to the ISIS leader directly.

The letter read: 'I am trying to get in touch with the Islamic State about my son's fate. I am an old woman, and Abdul-Rahman is my only child.

'My husband and I are on our own, with no help from the government. We would like to talk to you. How can we reach you?'

In a video published to YouTube on October 4, the Kassigs sat on a couch and spoke about the 26-year-old's humanitarian work during a desperate plea for his life.

'We are so very proud of you and the work you have done to bring humanitarian aid to the Syrian people,' Mrs Kassig said in the video as she clutched a photo of her son to her chest. 'Please know that we are all praying for you and your safe return.'

Ed and Paula Kassig posted a desperate message on YouTube pleading for mercy to the Islamic extremists

 On Wednesday, the hostage's mother, Paula Kassig, posted a message to Twitter pleading directly to the ISIS leader for her son's life 

 

She continued: 'Most of all, know that we love you and our hearts ache for you to be granted your freedom so we can hug you again and then set you free to continue the life you have chosen, a life of service to those in greatest need.

'We implore those who are holding you to show mercy and use their power to let you go.'  

Abdul-Rahman Kassig wrote in a letter to his parents, which they received on June 2, that he was 'scared to die' and saddened by the pain the ordeal has caused his family, BBC News reported.

Spring 2011-2012: Majored in political science at Butler University, Indiana. Graduated as a certified emergency medical technician

2012: Founded humanitarian aid group SERA (Special Emergency Response and Assistance) based in Gaziantep, Turkey

January 8, 2013: Moved to Beirut, Lebanon, working for SERA

July-August 2013: Observed Ramadan fast with Muslim colleagues

October 1, 2013: Kidnapped in Deir Ezzour, eastern Syria

Between October and December 2013: Converted in Islam while sharing a cell with a devout Muslim. His parents say his journey toward Islam started before captivity; insist he was not forced into conversion

June 2, 2013: Abdul-Rahman Kassig wrote to his parents. He explained his situation was 'dogmatically complicated', which they believe referred to his conversion. He said he prays five times a day 

The hostage wrote: 'I am obviously pretty scared to die but the hardest part is not knowing, wondering, hoping, and wondering if I should even hope at all.' 

He continued: 'If I do die, I figure that at least you and I can seek refuge and comfort in knowing that I went out as a result of trying to alleviate suffering and helping those in need.'

The hostage told his parents that he prayed every day and was not angry about his situation 'in terms of my faith'. 

The letter ended with the words: 'I love you.' 

The 26-year-old started his 'journey toward Islam' in 2013 while living and working with Syrian Muslims for his own humanitarian aid company in Beirut, they said.

According to a statement tweeted by Ed and Paula Kassig on Sunday, their son observed a month-long Ramadan fast between July and August 2013, which had a 'great impact on him'.

But it was not until after he was captured by ISIS in eastern Syria on October 1, 2013 that he made his conversion to the faith while sharing a cell with a devout Muslim.

Now going by the name Abdul-Rahman - which means 'slave of the merciful' in Arabic - the former U.S. Army private prays five times a day. 

Nearly 300 people gathered at Butler University in Indianapolis to celebrate Kassig's humanitarian work and pray for his release. Mr Kassig was a student at the university from 2011 to 2012.

Todd Hill, one of Mr Kassig's former classmates, praised the 26-year-old for his strength of character.

'He fully understood that this was a possibility and he accepted that, and I think that says a tremendous amount about the sort of person he is and to the kind of legacy he wants to create,' Mr Hill said.

Mr Kassig first went to the Middle East as a U.S. soldier in April 2007 when he was deployed to Iraq with the 75th Ranger Regiment.

He returned to Indianapolis in June 2007, and was honorably discharged as a first class private in September of that year due to an unspecified medical condition.

In the next two years, he reportedly got married and then divorced before enrolling as a political science major at Butler University, Indiana, in 2011.

In a video released last Friday, Islamic State militants threatened to kill American aid worker Abdul-Rahman Kassig

The Kassigs created a Twitter profile and tweeted a photo of a letter to the jihadist leader numerous times on Wednesday pleading for the life of their only son

He graduated in 2012 after taking a spring break holiday in Beirut. His trip inspired him to return later that year and set up his own humanitarian aid company, SERA (Special Emergency Response and Assistance).

The medically-oriented emergency relief group served refugee populations and internally displaced persons from Gaziantep, Turkey.

As of January 2013, he was based in Beirut, Lebanon, and traveled often to Gaziantep and parts of Syria.

Between July and August 2013, he observed Ramadan.

It was while working on a project for SERA almost exactly a year ago, on October 1, 2013, when he was captured by members of ISIS as he headed to Deir Ezzour in eastern Syria.

In 2013, Peter began his journey of conversion to Islam, where he changed his name to Abdul-Rahman -- which means 'slave of the merciful'
