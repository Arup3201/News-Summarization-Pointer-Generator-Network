Ashley Young has revealed that his Manchester United team-mates have played pranks on him about the bizarre incident that saw bird excrement flying into the winger's mouth during the 2-1 defeat by Swansea.

Young was berating his team's defenders when the waste appeared to fly into his open mouth.  

Oddly, the England forward has no real recollection of the incident, and when asked what happened  by Sky Sports, he said: 'I couldn't tell you.

As Young ranted at the shaky Manchester United defence, the bird excrement  flew towards his open mouth

Young continued to shout as the 'delivery' landed perfectly on his tongue in the match against Swansea

'I need to put it out there, I don't actually know. I don't know what happened.

'You would have seen a reaction from me. I've seen the video about 100 times.

'I don't know what it was. I need to get to the bottom of it.

'After it actually happened - I don't know who it was and I need to get to the bottom of this as well - above my locker there was a pigeon put up.

'I walked in and thought "Oh no". And that was it, everyone started taking pictures of it. Everyone thinks it actually happened. I don't know, I couldn't tell you.'
