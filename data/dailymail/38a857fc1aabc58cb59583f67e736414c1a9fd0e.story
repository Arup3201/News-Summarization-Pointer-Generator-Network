Ring leader: Admitted Russian mobster and former South Beach club owner Alec Simchuk, 46, has opened up to authorities after his arrest on fraud and bribery charges

The admitted Russian mobster behind a
swindling ring of Eastern European 'bar girls' is speaking out about his illegal operation that bamboozled eager-eyed male tourists out of tens of thousands of 
dollars.

Speaking to authorities from a Miami prison cell 
Alec Simchuk, 46, disclosed his operation of flying
women from Russia and the Baltic States into the U.S. to manipulate men at
his South Beach clubs.

Sent to seduce men from their 
expensive hotels to one of his private locations, he said the women lured 
their victims into extravagant bar tabs earning $400,000 
to $1 million in profits.

At least 88 men were duped, he said, 
with the most famous victim having been a Philadelphia weatherman who 
took his crisis public after spending more than $43,000 over two nights.

Charged for overpriced bottles of Dom
Perignon, Beluga caviar and in the weather man, John Bolaris' case, a 
$2,480 modern art painting, Simchuk 
said it was a gradual plot to get the men drunk and not realize what 
they were signing.

Appearing in a federal court last month were several of the so-called 'B girls' from Estonia and Latvia.

One testifying was 24-year-old Marina Turcina of Latvia, as the Miami Herald reports.

Baited: Simchuk has admitted to flying women from Russia and the Baltic States into the U.S. to manipulate men at his private South Beach clubs, including pictured Anna Kilimatova, 25, of Latvia

Speaking out: Testifying against Simchuk and his illegal operations has been 24-year-old 'B-girl' Marina Turcina of Latvia, pictured, who previously pleaded guilty to her involvement

He was just signing them without 
looking at them,' Turcina told the court of Mr Bolaris' signature to 
anything she and the other women handed him.

'They come over and they said, "Do 
you want to do a shot?"' Mr 
Bolaris, who is expected to testify, previously recounted of his 
experience to ABC's 20/20.

'And I go, "No I don't want to do a shot." Then 
one comes behind me, rubs my shoulders, pulls back my head and says, 
"Come on, do a shot". And I said, "All right, I'll do a shot."'

After
having a few drinks with the women they took him in a taxi to their 
friend's art shop. He said after that the details are very sketchy.

'I remember standing up ... signing something, vaguely. Next thing I know, I'm in a cab with a big painting [of a woman's head].

'Then I woke up, I had red wine on my shirt, fully clothed and I'm thinking - something happened, but what?'

Big spenders: Valeria Matsova, 22, pictured of 
Estonia, is also one of the named 'B-girls' who helped lure 
at least 88 men in all to the private clubs and purposely racking up 
thousands of dollars worth of bar tabs

Prize: The women, two pictured from left Kristina Takhalov, 29, of Miami Beach and Agnese Rudaka, 22, of Latvia, were promised a 20 per cent commission off of the men's bar tabs

Duped: Banding together, the women would lure the men from expensive hotels in Miami to the private clubs, 22-year-old Julija Vinogradova of Latvia pictured

Making matters worse for Mr Bolaris 
was his mistake of spending a second night with the women after they 
called him up to get together saying they found his sunglasses.

As part of Simchuk's deal each woman would receive a 20 per cent commission from the men's perceived lucky night on the town.

Starting out at fancy hotels like the
Delano, the women targeted wealthy looking tourists, 
according to court documents, who were judged by their expensive watches, 
clothes and shoes.

Those who were cheap and found lacking otherwise were called 'condoms' by the women, the Miami Herald reports.

If successful in capturing a victim, a text would get sent out to one of the club's bartenders telling them to get the place ready.

Once there, the women would press the
men into ordering more and more rounds of drinks while they carefully 
poured theirs into flower vases, watching their victim down theirs.

Having developed a similar method 
while operating a club in Latvia, Simchuk told authorities that he 
purposely used small font on bar menus and that he would have his bar 
tenders pour vodka in his customers’ beer.

As their victim became more and more 
intoxicated it became easier to encourage them to order another round, 
the women said, often of the most expensive drink available – with 
inflated prices.

In total Simchuk admitted to scamming between $400,000 and $1 million from the men.

With the men one-by-one later waking 
up to outstanding charges on their credit cards in the yearlong 
operation, authorities stepped in, responding to the growing number of 
bizarrely similar complaints.

Bamboozled: The most famous victim was Philadelphia weatherman John Bolaris, a notorious ladies' man pictured here with his former Playboy Playmate girlfriend Erica Smitheman

Conned: In all Mr Bolaris, pictured out with friends, said he spent more than $43,000 over two days in bar tabs with the women

Staging an undercover investigation 
at one of the clubs for the B-girls and their managers, the women were 
caught on tape plying the men and ultimately allowing a warrant for 
Simchuk's arrest.

Eleven defendants, who were mostly women, pleaded guilty to the sham and served short prison sentences.

Simchuk fled to Latvia and then Russia before saying he found that a life on the run wasn’t for him.

Preparing to come clean this spring, 
it was a group of strangers on the street of St Petersburg that 
he said threateningly encouraged him to choose otherwise.

One guy pulled gun on my head and 
said, "Good people from Miami don't want you to testify. You have 
beautiful wife. Stay at home,"' he told authorities according to the Herald.

'Another guy just broke my leg. Just squeeze it in one shot,' he said.

Turcin in court alluded to Simchuk being no better, having forced the women he hired in his overseas clubs to sleep with him, in a similar fashion to his operations in Miami.

'They were scared to lose the job, so they were sleeping with him,' she testified.

Simchuk admitted to having a never satisfied desire for sex but against the girls said they knew what they were doing when working for him, and with their roles against the tourists in Miami, he said they knew what to say and do all on their own.

'They are professional liars,' he said.

In July Simchuk returned to Miami to face his charges and was greeted by federal officers who placed him under arrest.

Simchuck has since pleaded guilty to wire fraud conspiracy and visa violations.

He's now aiding prosecutors by 
testifying against the five defendants now on trial of Stanislav 
Pavlenko, 41, Albert Takhalov, 31, his wife, Kristina Takhalov, 31, 
Siavash Zargari, 48, and Isaac Feldman, 51, who ran in a 2010 city 
commission election.

The Herald reports Feldman invested $25,000 in one of the clubs run by Simchuk and Takhalov.

All five are accused as organizers and investors in the operation.

If convicted they face a maximum 
penalty of 20 years in prison for each wire fraud related count, 10 
years for each count in connection with immigration documents, five 
years in prison for conspiracy to defraud the U.S. in connection with 
immigration documents and 15 years in prison for the bribery count.
