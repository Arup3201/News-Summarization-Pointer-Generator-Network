One is a figure of fun who convinces himself he is still loved by the nation by hosting eccentric phone-ins on local radio. The other is Alan Partridge.

Nick Clegg today showed how his conversion into the comedy character has stepped up a gear with the unveiling of a bright yellow mobile radio studio almost identical to one used in the hit film Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa.

The Lib Dem leader is to tour the country in an election battlebus fitted out with a radio studio to allow him to continue his regular broadcasts designed to drum up support before May 7.

He will hope to avoid the fate of Partridge in the 2013 movie, which saw the DJ accidentally shoot himself in the leg on Cromer pier.

Mr Clegg is pinning his hopes of survival on wooing women in key parts of the country.

The Lib Dems claim that a drop in undecided voters in selected marginal seats has coincided with a rise in support for their party.

Today he appeared with his battlebus in Abingdon, part of a key marginal seat the Lib Dems are hoping to win back from the Conservatives.

Party officials said that Mr Clegg's battlebus has been fitted with a satellite radio transmitter so that he can do interviews and radio phone-ins while he is on the road.

Since January 2013, the Deputy PM has hosted Call Clegg on LBC, answering questions from listeners ranging from the political to the personal.

Conversations about where he buys his underpants, wearing a onesie and  the price of diesel could have been lifted straight from a Partridge script.

In the film Alpha Papa, Steve Coogan's character is taken hostage by sacked fellow DJ Pat Farrell and they continue their broadcast on the road using the bright yellow roadshow truck.

The Lib Dem vehicle is decorated with abstract images by two graphic design students and the slogans 'stronger economy, fairer society' and 'opportunity for everyone', in contrast with 2010's campaign bus which featured prominent photographs of Mr Clegg and Vince Cable.

Addressing activists today Mr Clegg took aim at both the Tories and the Labour party, ahead of the election on May 7.

He warned that leaving the European Union would be an act of economic 'self harm' and said it was 'stating the flaming obvious' that the UK needed to be at the heart of Europe.

He said he was 'dismayed' by Ed Miliband's failure to spell out details of when he would balance the nation's books.

Mr Clegg said: 'Of course we have different views to the Conservatives. I'm the leader of the Liberal Democrats, David Cameron is the leader of the Conservatives.

'They have a completely different attitude towards Europe. They have this hokey cokey where one day they want to leave, the next day they don't want to leave.

'We are unambiguous as a party that says 'yes, Europe needs to be reformed, yes there needs to be a referendum when a decision needs to be made about the transfer of powers to the European Union, we guaranteed that in law'.

'We are not like the Conservative Party, half of whom are straining at the leash to leave. We think that would be a terrible thing for the British economy.

'But in the same way I strongly disagree with Ed Miliband and Ed Balls's failure to spell out when they would actually balance the books. I am dismayed the Labour Party want to borrow GBP70 billion more than we think is needed.'

He added: 'Of course it would be an economic act of self harm to leave the European Union.

'Large parts of the Conservative Party and Ukip appear to want Britain to cut itself off from what is the world's largest marketplace with hundreds of millions of customers for British goods and services.

'For me it's stating the flaming obvious that we need to secure Britain's presence at the heart of the European Union in the same way it's flaming obvious that we should secure the British economic recovery by finishing the job of balancing the books but doing it in a fair and sensible way - not taking an ideological approach to cuts, which is the Conservative approach, nor taking such an irresponsible approach to borrowing, which is Labour's approach.'

Lib Dem strategists believe that winning over the female vote will be crucial to their chances of success across a range of key battleground constituencies.

The Tories have often been accused of having a 'woman', with support much higher among male voters.

The latest YouGov poll for the Sunday Times shows 33 per cent of men plan to back the Conservatives, compared to 31 per cent of women. For Labour it shows 35 per cent men, 36 per cent women.

But for Lib Dems, just 6 per cent of men plan to vote for Mr Clegg's party, rising to 9 per cent among women.

The Lib Dems point to internal polling which suggests women voters coming over to them in a series of must-win seats

They point to internal polling which suggests women voters coming over to them in a series of must-win seats.

Their analysis of 18 marginals shows that the number of women who say they are undecided as to which way they will vote on May 7 has fallen from 30.6 per cent in 2014 to 22.6 per cent - a drop of 8 per cent.

Over the same period they say that support for the Lib Dems in those seats has risen from 15.2% to 24.9 per cent - an increase of 9.7 per cent.

They say younger women particularly are attracted by their policy on shared parental leave, while headline plans to prioritise mental health, raise tax thresholds and cut the deficit are popular among women generally.
