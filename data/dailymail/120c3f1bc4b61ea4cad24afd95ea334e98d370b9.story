A Newcastle photographer has created the world's first printer which produces self-destructing documents, just like those seen in Mission: Impossible.

Similar in size to a regular printer but much more complex, the device coats paper in particular substances that begin to ignite when combined.

This gives the reader just 60 seconds to read the paper document before it bursts into flames.

A printer that creates self-destructing paper (shown) has been unveiled. The device was created by Newcastle photographer Diego Pisanty. It is part of a project called 'This Tape Will Self Destruct'. Its name is in homage to the 1966 spy series Mission Impossible, which also spawned several movies

Diego Pisanty, 27, spent a year building the printer.

The complex machine coats one part of the paper with a light dusting of potassium salts while layering another section with glycerol gel.

Once the print is finished, a mechanism in the printer presses the two sections together, sparking a chemical reaction which destroys the document in a Mission: Impossible-style blaze after a delay of around a minute.

Mr Pisanty titled his quirky homebrew project This Tape Will Self Destruct in homage to the 1966 spy series.

Earlier this month Tokyo-based electronics company Epson  unveiled two new printers that have refillable tanks rather than ink cartridges.

In place of costly cartridges they both have an ink reservoir.

This can print 4,000 pages in black or 6,500 in colour on one fill.

When depleted it costs £8 to refill the printers with Epson's own ink.

Two printers are on sale now, the L355 at £249.99 ($400) and the L555 at £329.99 ($530).

Both come with wireless connectivity so users can print from their smartphones.

Mr Pisanty said: 'It's a pretty slow reaction so it gives you about a minute to read the document. It will then start to smoke and eventually go up in flames.'

The printer cost more than £4,000 ($6,440) to build. Mr Pisanty used a laser cutter to fashion many of the machine's individual components.

Mr Pisanty said: 'It took a very long time to build. I had no social life for the best part of a year.'

Despite the machine's potential for making sure sensitive documents do not fall into the wrong hands, Mr Pisanty is pessimistic about its chances of adoption among the security services.

He said: 'I don't think the security agencies will be using this technology any time soon.

'They're more interested in encryption for digital files. 

'There isn't much need for the destruction of hard-copy documents any more.'

 

The £4,000 printer coats paper in potassium salts and glycerol gel. When combined they start to ignite in 60 seconds. This gives the reader just a minute before the paper catches fire. Mr Pisanty got the idea from the NSA and Wikileaks scandals. But he says it might not have much use in the digital age

'What was happening in the news really reminded me of 1960s spy novels,' said Mr Pisanty. 'It was this blurring of fiction and reality that made me want to take something from a spy thriller and make a real, functioning object.'

Mr Pisanty became fascinated with replicating the iconic TV gadget after reading several articles on the NSA and Wikileaks scandals.

Mr Pisanty said: 'I had read an article on how the Russians had gone back to using typewriters to avoid the leaking of digital files.

'What was happening in the news really reminded me of 1960s spy novels.

'It was this blurring of fiction and reality that made me want to take something from a spy thriller and make a real, functioning object.'

In September 2014 Mr Pisanty, who was born in Mexico, debuted the machine in Mexico's San Pedro Museum in Puebla.

While on display guests could print out combustible documents that were stored on an internal, encrypted, SD card within the printer.

Video footage and burnt images from This Tape Will Self Destruct will stay on display at the San Pedro Museum until February 2015.

The machine itself was put into storage having been deemed a major fire hazard if operated without supervision.
