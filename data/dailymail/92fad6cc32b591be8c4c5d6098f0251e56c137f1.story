Roy Keane has revealed he didn't sign Robbie Savage when he was Sunderland manager because the midfielder's voicemail message was 'Hi, it's Robbie - whazzup!'.

Savage at the time was struggling for playing time at Blackburn and Keane wanted to bring him to the Stadium of Light in a bid to boost his side's performance.

But Savage didn't answer Keane's call and the Irishman changed his mind when he heard the player's voicemail, based on the catchphrase from the Budweiser advert in the early 2000s.

The Welshman was struggling for game time at Blackburn when Roy Keane enquired about signing him

Since his retirement from football the joker has appeared on shows like BBC's 'Strictly Come Dancing'

In his new autobiography The Second Half, Keane explains: 'I rang Mark Hughes. Robbie [Savage] wasn’t in the Blackburn team and I asked Mark if we could try to arrange a deal.

'Sparky said, "Yeah, yeah he's lost his way here but he could still do a job for you."

'Robbie's legs were going a bit but I thought he might come up to us [at Sunderland] with his long hair, and give us a lift – the way Yorkie [Dwight Yorke] had, a big personality in the dressing room.

'Sparky gave me permission to give him a call. So I got Robbie's mobile number and rang him.

'It went to his voicemail, "Hi it’s Robbie – whazzup!" like the Budweiser ad.

The midfielder had successful spells at Birmingham City and Derby County, where he ended his career

'I never called him back. I thought: "I can’t be f***ing signing that.”’

Keane's objection was possibly not only to the puerile message but also the fact that, by the time he heard the message, it was years out of date. 

Responding on Twitter, Savage said: 'Oh come on Roy whattttsuppppppppp !!!! Hahahaha. 

'Whether or not Roy did try and sign me I chose derby over Sunderland as they offered me more and I didn't want to move house !!

'But it's great to know Roy keane obviously liked me as a player as he was one of best midfielders ever !! #whatssuppppppp.' 

Savage then took to the social media site to offer his fans a prize-winning opportunity: 'Whats the funniest thing you've heard on answer phone messege [sic] best one I'll give a signed golf shoe by me.scholesy,vaughny Hargreaves'.
