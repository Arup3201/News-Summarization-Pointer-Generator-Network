Dutch club FC Utrecht  have followed through on their threat to report Swansea City to FIFA over money they say is owed to them from the sale of Michel Vorm to Tottenham.

The Eredivisie side dispute Swansea’s claim that Vorm was signed by Spurs on a free transfer and insist they are owed 30 per cent of whatever the Welsh club received, in line with a sell-on clause inserted in the deal when the goalkeeper arrived at the Liberty Stadium from Utrecht in 2011.

Swansea are adamant no fee was involved and therefore owe Utrecht nothing, but a spokesman for the Dutch club claimed to Sportsmail on Monday that they have now formally called on FIFA to investigate. The world governing body also confirmed the developments.

In a separate statement, Wilco van Schaik, Utrecht’s general manager, said: ‘Swansea reported earlier on its own website that they sold Vorm for an undisclosed amount.

‘I spoke with chairman Huw Jenkins who had a different story. He told me that they let him go for free. That’s unbelievable and unacceptable. He is 30 years old, in the prime of his life. He still had a two-year contract and has a good reputation. Besides that he’s a solid member of the Dutch squad.

‘Everyone knows that Michel wasn’t sold for zero pounds. That money went somewhere. We want to know where.

‘We have brought this transfer to the FIFA.’

Swansea insisted last week that they will make no further comment on the subject after denying they had a case to answer. They said the deal was ‘conducted and concluded correctly’ and ‘approved by the Premier League and also FIFA via their TMS system’.

Vorm joined Swansea for £1.5m in 2011, but was allowed to leave after the summer signing of Lukasz Fabianski from Arsenal.
