The Icelandic sagas of the Norse people are 1,000-year-old chronicles of brave deeds and timeless romances, but how true to Viking life were they?

To find out, physicists Professor Ralph Kenna and student Pádraig Mac Carron created a statistical network of associations between characters in ancient texts including The Tain, Beowulf as well as Homer's Iliad.

These were then compared to the characters mentioned in five of the Icelandic sagas, believed to be loosely based on fact.

This network combines the character associations between the five major Icelandic sagas, including overlapping characters in Egil (blue), Vatnsdaela (yellow), Laxdæla Saga (green), Gisla (turquoise) and Njáls Saga (red). White nodes represent characters who appear in more than one of these sagas

The Táin is a legendary tale from early Irish literature.

It details a war against Ulster by the Connacht queen Medb and her husband Ailill, set in the 1st century AD.

Beowulf is an Old English epic poem set in Scandinavia.

In the poem, Beowulf, a hero of the Geatish poeple in Scandinavia, helps Hroðgar, the king of the Danes, when he comes under attack by the monster Grendel.

Beowulf later becomes King of the Geats in Sweden.

He dies after a battle with a dragon fifty years on. 

The Iliad is an ancient Greek poem set during the Trojan War.

It details the the ten-year siege of the city of Troy, as well as the battles between King Agamemnon and the warrior Achilles.

These tales aren't Icelandic, but were studied because the Icelandic sagas are said to have 
borrowed from these, and similar, stories.

By exploring the number of interactions 
between protagonists, the researchers built a network of recurring 
characters, which in turn helped to reveal if the stories were pure fiction or if they are based on a historically accurate society.

In 2010, Professor Mac Carron and Kenna studied the historical tales in the Táin, Beowulf, and The Iliad.

These tales aren't Icelandic - the Tain is Irish, Beowulf is Scandinavian, and The Illiad is an ancient Greek poem - but they were studied because the Icelandic sagas are said to have borrowed from these, and similar, stories.

The researchers made a note each time a character appeared, and each time he or she interacted with someone.

They then compared these to data from 18 narratives, five of which contain over 100 characters each. 

These included the Njáls saga, Laxdæla saga, Vatnsdæla saga, Egils saga Skallagrímssonar and Gísla saga Súrssonar.

These five tales were examined individually in order to compare different sagas to each other.

They also studied the sagas collectively, and from a network of 1549 individual characters, were able to gain insight into the structure of the overall saga society.

The network described in The Iliad, for example, was relatively similar to what is known about the ancient Greek society that historically existed.

Beowulf also had references to factual networks. Whereas, The Táin's network appeared more artificial.

The researchers concluded that while that doesn’t mean the events were based entirely on fact, or were entirely fictional, they resemble how modern-day social networks function and appear as statistical networks.

For social networks, nodes represent people or characters in a text and the links denote interactions. Network theory attempts to show how these relationships are distributed. In this simplified version, examples of friendly relations are shown in green, and red connections are hostile

Physicists Ralph Kenna and Pádraig Mac Carron created a statistical network of associations by studying characters mentioned in the Tain, The Illiad (pictured) and Beowulf manuscripts. These were compared to data from 18 narratives, five of which are Icelandic sagas and contain over 100 characters each

They also discovered that many of the secondary characters were better connected than protagonists, suggesting these people were more influential to plots, or in real life, than first thought.

‘We can conclude that whether the sagas are historically accurate or not, the properties of the social worlds they record are similar to those of real social networks,’ said Kenna.

‘Although one cannot conclusively determine whether the saga societies are real, on the basis of network theory we can conclude that they are remarkably realistic.’

In the Njáls saga, warrior Gunnar Hámundarson is exiled from Iceland but refuses to leave and is killed. His friend Njáll Þorgeirsson is later burned alive as part of a vengeance campaign.

The saga dates to the late 13th century, but is set between 960 and 1020. 

Laxdæla saga was also written in the 13th century and is set in Breiðafjörður, Iceland from the late 9th century to the early 11th century.

The saga focuses on a love triangle between Guðrún Ósvífrsdóttir, Kjartan Ólafsson and Bolli Þorleiksson, which leads to a feud, and ultimately the death of Ólafsson and Þorleiksson.

In Njáls saga, Gunnar Hámundarson is exiled from Iceland but stays, and is killed. His friend Njáll Þorgeirsson is later burned alive as part of a vengeance campaign. The saga (illustration pictured left) is set between 960 and 1020. Egil's Saga tells the story of Icelandic viking Egil Skallagrimsson (illustration pictured right)

In Vatnsdœla saga, written in the 13th century, was set in a valley south of Hunafloi in the north of Iceland in the late 10th century.

It follows the story of Ingimundur and his family. Ingimundur was the grandson of chieftain Ketill Raum and fought for King Harald Fairhair of Norway at the battle of Hafrsfjord.

Egil's Saga was written in 1240 AD, but the story begins in Norway in 850. It tells the tale of Icelandic farmer and viking Egil Skallagrimsson.

Gísla saga Súrssonar tells the story of Gisli between 940 and 984. Gisli is told he must kill one of his brothers-in-law to avenge another.

He is outlawed and forced to stay on the run for thirteen years before he is finally hunted down and killed.

It was made into a film called Útlaginn, or The Outlaw, in 1981.

Other findings, which suggest the stories may have biographical elements include the number of recurring characters.

For example, the pair found a large overlap between the Njal's Saga, and the Laxdæla Saga which hasn’t been spotted before.

The Laxdæla Saga also featured more interactions with women than had previously been discussed.

This means previously unknown patterns had been revealed, and because the sagas are thought to have been written using genealogical reports, they may have been based on factual connections.
