A nanny accused of killing two children in their Manhattan home before attempting to take her own life appeared in court on Wednesday.

Yoselyn Ortega, 52, covered the self-inflicted, knife wound scars on her neck with a white turtleneck and a fleece top, bowing her head as she sat alongside her defense attorney at Manhattan's Criminal Court. The hearing was adjourned until March 20. 

Ortega  is accused of stabbing to death six-year-old Lucia Krim, and her little brother Leo, aged two, at the family's Upper West Side apartment in October 2012.

Victims: Six-year-old Lucia Krim, left, and her little brother, two-year-old Leo, were found dead in their Upper West Side apartment in 2012. Their nanny is accused of first-degree murder 

The children's mother, Marina Krim was picking up her third child, Nessie, from a swimming lesson when she returned to find her children dead in the bathtub.

Ortega, 52, was lying beside the children, having cut her throat in a suicide attempt.

According to court documents in November, Ortega told authorities that she hurt the children because she was having money problems and was angry at the parents. 

She said her schedule constantly shifted, she had to act as a cleaning lady though she didn't want to and she missed an appointment with 'the psych,' according to the papers.

'I had to do everything and take care of the kids,' she said. 'God forgive me, so many things they made me do. Pray for me.' 

Ortega's attorney, Valerie Van Leer-Greenberg had also claimed in November that her client had no memory of the horrifying attacks.

The lawyer claimed that after showing the accused killer images of the gruesome scene, 'she turns to me and says, "Oh, my God, who did that to them?" She has no mind, no memory of the incident'.

Ortega, a  Dominican immigrant, has been charged with murder but maintains she is innocent. A judge has declared her mentally fit to stand trial.

Following the tragedy, the Krims have begun to rebuild their lives. Mrs Krim and her TV executive husband Kevin had another son, Felix, who is now around a year old.

NYPD officers stood guard beside Ortega as she sat before the judge on Wednesday. The 52-year-old former nanny is accused of stabbing to death two children in her care

Ortega maintains her innocence over the brutal murders and had claimed to her lawyer in November that she had no idea what she had done 

According to earlier court documents, Ortega (pictured on Wednesday in cuffs) told authorities that she hurt the children because she was having money problems and was angry at the parents
