Too tight! The school deemed Lauren's close-fitting trousers unacceptable

It is usually the norm that a schoolgirl would be reprimanded for her skirt being too short.

But in this case, one pupil was sent home because her trousers were not flared enough and deemed far too tight.

Teachers also made Lauren Entwistle learn in isolation at Swavesey Village College in Cambridgeshire, because the offending black school trousers did not have the correct 'flarage'.

Her mother Mandy Entwistle, 37, today said she was furious her daughter missed a day-and-a-half of GCSE lessons just because her trousers were the wrong style.

She said the school had banned various styles of trousers because they were deemed fashionable, but she had decided the bootcut version that they ask pupils to wear looks untidy and can get caught in bikes.

Bizarrely, the school has now ordered Lauren new trousers, which they deem suitable, from the same website as the original ones.

Mother-of-four Ms Entwistle said: 'I just do not understand how sending a child home from school because her trousers are too tight around the ankles is beneficial for anybody.

'Are we supposed to get a tape measure out and measure the flarage?

'I could understand if they were too tight in case they are distracting for the boys, but that is not the issue.

'I bought them from a school uniform website. I would not send her to school in leggings. I always make sure she looks smart.

'When I was at school bootcut trousers were banned because they were in fashion and not straight trousers are banned because they are in fashion.

'I think the flared trousers do not look very smart as they often get caught in their bikes or shoes.

'The school say they want the pupils to behave like young adults and then they treat Lauren like a child over some trousers.

'She wears the trousers to work at her hair salon and they are considered smart enough - so if they are appropriate for the world of work they should be good enough for school.'

The seething mother, who runs her own cleaning business, added: 'Lauren is a well-behaved pupil and despite her interest in beauty she respects the rules and does not have her nails done or wear make up to school.

'I refuse to let them put Lauren in the isolation room is like a prison cell - it is like something out of a torture camp.

'They will make them wear orange jumpsuits next.'

Lauren, who lives with her mother and stay-at-home father Allen, 40, in Swavesey, Cambridgeshire, was sent home at about 10am on Monday and missed the rest of her lessons that day.

Mandy sent her back to school on Tuesday, but Lauren had to work in the teachers’ office missing her favourite lesson, health and beauty.

Furious mother Mandy said: 'I just do not understand how sending a child home from school because her trousers are too tight around the ankles is beneficial for anybody.'

Her outraged mother cannot believe the GCSE student has missed a day and a half of lessons just because of the style of her trousers

She was allowed to take part in lessons on Wednesday after the school ordered Lauren some new trousers - which Mandy says came from the same uniform website she originally used.

Swavesey Village College today confirmed it has clamped down on their uniform policy, which they say helps them deliver 'very high standards.'

The school’s uniform policy states that girls must wear bootcut trousers to ensure everyone is dressed the same and to prevent girls wearing leggings.

A source at the school confirmed there is an isolation room, but said pupils are given work to do and supervised by staff.

Andrew Daly, acting headteacher at Swavesey Village College, today said the school is rated 'outstanding' and expects 'very high standards.'

He said: 'Part of these expectations is a very clear uniform policy, that in consultation with parents and students we apply fairly and consistently.

'We explained before the summer our expectations about uniform and girls’ trousers in particular to ensure they are appropriate.

'All parents were given the summer to arrange for the correct uniform to be purchased.

'Students are offered opportunities to rectify issues with uniform before going to lessons, either by being lent uniform we keep in stock or having uniform brought in from home.

'If they refuse to respond to either of these options then we do have a clear sanctions policy in place.'

A school has been accused of acting like 'lunatics' after it sent home 70 pupils for flouting a tough new uniform code - even though suppliers ahd run out of the regulation uniforms.

Hardline City of London Academy Islington (COLA-I) in north London, which has about 800 students aged from 11-18, dismissed the pupils last Wednesday morning, on the first day of the new term.

The youngsters were ordered to go home with letters detailing how they had breached the strict new guidelines.

A number of students were dismissed for not having the required rucksacks emblazoned with the COLA-I emblem.

But the academy later relaxed the criteria after finding out the uniform stockists had sold out of the bags.

Mr Coogan, of Finsbury, said his 13-year-old daughter Georgina had been sent home.

He said: 'They acted like lunatics, sending children onto the streets.'

Mr Coogan said Georgina had remained off school as her skirt had still not arrived at the uniform stockists.

COLA-I's executive principal Mark Emmerson said the uniform change was the subject of a letter posted to all homes in July as well as a text message to parents on Tuesday last week , the day before term began.

'The vast majority of the children were stopped at the gate, sent home and were back within half an hour.

'I was prepared to sacrifice the first day of teaching as this is part of our strategy to increase and improve standards.'
