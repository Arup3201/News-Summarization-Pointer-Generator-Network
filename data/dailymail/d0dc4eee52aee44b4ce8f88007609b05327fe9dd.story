Philip Pickett has been jailed after luring pupils into sound-proof music rooms at Guildhall School of Music and Drama to sexually assault them

An eminent classical musician who taught at the Guildhall School of Music has been jailed for 11 years for sexually abusing pupils in soundproofed music rooms.

Philip Pickett, one of Britain’s best recorder players and an internationally renowned expert on early music, used his fame to prey on two teenage schoolgirls and a 21-year-old woman whom he locked in practice rooms where no one could hear their screams.

Police believe the 64-year-old may have attacked scores of women around the world as he toured with orchestras during a glittering career spanning four decades.

It can be revealed that complaints were made about him to police in Milan in 1988, where he was accused of indecently assaulting a 26-year-old woman he performed with at a concert.

Detectives believe there are other victims in other countries, who may have not have reported the assaults because of his influence at the world-leading conservatoire.

The three-times married teacher was first reported to the principal of the school, where he taught music between 1972 and 1997, more than three decades ago.

The mother of a 17-year-old wrote to the then head, John Hosier, in the 1980s saying her daughter had been molested in a locked windowless music room. But instead of Pickett being reported to police, the girl was told to find another school.

Mr Hosier informed the mother that he had received no other complaints and took no further action, despite Pickett refusing to see his boss to discuss the allegations.

The next year Guildhall awarded Pickett a fellowship, one of its highest honours, in recognition of his musical achievements. Pickett, described as a ‘social animal’, left the Guildhall in 1997 and went on to be artistic director of the Southbank Centre and director of early music at Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre.

The conductor was not reported to police until 2013, in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. He continued to deny the offences and demanded that his Old Bailey trial be delayed so he could continue to perform with folk musician Carlos Nunez and the New London Consort group which he founded.

Martin Heslop, QC, defending, even tried to persuade the judge that his sentence should be delayed so he could attend music festivals in Bologna, Vienna and Manchester. But Judge Charles Wide refused and jailed him for 11 years after he was convicted of two rapes and two indecent assaults by a jury earlier this month.

The case can now be reported after the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to proceed with another trial relating to a girl who was allegedly sexually assaulted between the ages of 13 and 15 in the 1970s. The CPS also decided not to go ahead with an allegation of assault occasioning actual bodily harm on an ex-partner. All these remaining charges were left on file.

Pickett was cleared of six other charges against four young women. 

The court heard how Pickett, 64, tried to delay sentencing after being convicted of sexual offences. The professional record player taught at Guildhall School of Music and Drama for 25 years

The teacher, who lives in a £500,000 cottage in Lyneham, near Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire, with his wife, a singer and harpsichord player, showed no remorse.

At least one of his victims was so traumatised that she abandoned her dreams of a career in music.

Sentencing him for the ‘terrible crimes’, Judge Wide said: ‘You were their teacher. To a degree, they were in awe of you, especially the schoolgirls. There is the location of the offences – in the practice rooms at the Guildhall School of Music. Soundproofed and dark – even if they had shouted they could not have been heard.’

One 16-year-old recorder player was assaulted on her first lesson after she won a place in the school’s sixth-form in 1978. Pickett told her she needed to work on her breathing and asked her to take her top off. He then told her to lie on the floor, turned out the lights and forced her to commit a sex act.

During the second lesson Pickett raped her. She refused to go to any more lessons but did not tell her mother until ten years later.

The court heard how Pickett would take vulnerable pupils into sound-proof rooms at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama (above) to assault them 

A 17-year-old recorder player was attacked during a lesson in the 1980s after Pickett told her he would show her how to breathe and turned off the lights. She told her mother, whose letter of complaint was rejected by the head.

The third victim was a 21-year-old student. When she went to the Guildhall for private tuition he locked the door and raped her on the floor of a practice room.

A police spokesman said: ‘Potentially there are significant amounts of victims out there.

‘I would urge these people to contact the City of London Police.’
