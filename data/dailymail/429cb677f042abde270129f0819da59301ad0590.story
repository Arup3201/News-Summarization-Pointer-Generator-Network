From presenting MTV to walking the catwalks of high end designers, such as Vivienne Westwood and Chanel, it's fair to say that Lilah Parsons is a bit of a chameleon when it comes to her career.

In her latest modelling venture, the 25-year-old has ditched the designers and taken to the high street as she models the latest festival collection for online fashion retailer, Very.

Following in the footsteps of Fearne Cotton and Holly Willoughby the TV presenter shows off her boho style in Very's latest festival collection featuring summer staples such as playsuits, denim & lace shorts, printed parkas, denim
 jackets and maxi dresses to name a few.

In a wash of sepia tones, the photo shoot captures the festival vibe perfectly with Lilah's heavy 1960s fringe adding to the 'summer of love' feel.

Since being named as one of British Vogue's 'Model Faces to Watch in 2010' Lilah's career has gone from strength to strength from featuring as the face of Swatch watches across bilboards in Times Square New York to modelling for a plethora of different brands including Vivienne Westwood, Chanel, Pam Hogg and Diesel.

However, Lilah's modelling career hasn't remained exclusively in the designer department as she has previously dabbled in high street modelling having appeared in campaigns for Claire's Accessories and TK Maxx.

At the Claire's Paris Fashion Week party the model said she loved the brand and the fact that it was cheaper meant that she could constantly update her look.

'I love their stuff. It's fun and fashionable and it means that I can change my look every five minutes.'

It appears that her shoot with Very may have had an influence on Lilah's summer style as she said that she would be channeling the sixties vibe this summer.

'This summer I'm going to be wearing lots of the round Sixties shades and piles of rings.'

Very’s festival collection is available online now at Very.co.uk and includes pieces from their Love label and Definitions collections.
