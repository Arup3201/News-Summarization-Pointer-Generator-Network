Archaeologists in South America have discovered the first undisturbed tomb of the ancient and mysterious Wari civilisation, unearthing the mummified bodies of three Queens alongside golden treasures and macabre human sacrifices.

The 1,200-year-old 'temple of the dead' was found at the El Castillo de Huarmey site, a four-hour drive north of the Pruvian capital Lima.

It provides a wealth of information about the enigmatic Wari empire that ruled the Andes long before their better-known Incan successors.

'For the first time in the history of archeology in Peru we have found an imperial tomb that belongs to the Wari empire and culture,' lead archeologist Milosz Giersz, of the joint Polish-Peruvian team, said.

Researchers said the discovery will help them piece together life in the Andes centuries before the rise of the Incan empire, which was written about in detail by the conquering Spaniards.

The mausoleum, unearthed a few months ago at a coastal pyramid site contained gold pieces, ceramics and 63 skeletons about 1,300 years old.

Researchers said most of the bodies 
found in the burial chamber were mummified women sitting upright - 
indicating royalty and suggesting Wari women held more power than 
previously thought.The Wari, who came from Peruâ€™s southern highlands and ruled a vast area of the country from 500 to 1000 AD, conducted multiple burials and sent their loved ones into the afterlife with provisions and the tools of their trade.

'The 
women were buried with finely engraved ear pieces made of precious 
metals that once were believed to be used only by men,' archaeologist 
Patrycja Przadk said.

Among 
the other artfacts discopvered alongside the mummfied queens were 
weaving tools made of gold, ritual kinives and axes, drinking cups, coca
 leaf containers and an array of beautifully decorated ceramics.

Macabre: Skeletons, believed to be human sacrifices thrown into the tomb moments before it was sealed, were found alongside the mummified remains

Historians believe the Wari, who ruled between 600 and 1100 A.D., were the first people to unite diverse tribes into a sophisticated network across most of today's Peruvian Andes.

Bioarchaeologist Wieslaw Wieckowski said six skeletons were not wrapped in textiles and appear to have been human sacrifices for the mummified elite.

'They were people thrown into the grave before the grave was sealed,' he said. 'They were lying on their bellies, in an extended position and their limbs went in different directions.'

Archaeologists told National Geographic that they kept their work quiet for fear grave robbers would pick the site clean.
