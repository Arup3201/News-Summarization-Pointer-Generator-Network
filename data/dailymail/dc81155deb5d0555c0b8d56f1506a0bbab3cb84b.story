NHS staff are being told not to say sorry when asking grieving relatives if they will donate loved ones’ organs.

Guidelines instruct them not  to use ‘negative or apologetic language’ but instead stress the benefits the organs could bring to critically ill patients.

They have been issued by the NHS in the hope of boosting the number of donors, saving hundreds of lives.

Guidance: The advice instructs staff not to be 'negative or apologetic' when asking about organ donation

There are 10,000 patients who need new 
organs – most commonly livers, kidneys and hearts – and three die every 
day while on waiting lists.

But although more people are signing up to be donors, most die at an age when their organs are no longer fit to be given to someone else.

There are concerns that relatives occasionally override a dead patient’s wishes by refusing to allow organ donation.

The NHS’s Blood and Transplant Authority is hoping to change attitudes to the issue.

Paul Murphy, the organisation’s national clinical lead, said the highly sensitive discussions would not take place until families had come to terms with the death.

He said: ‘Their death is sudden, it  is unexpected, it is untimely, it is occasionally violent – a road traffic accident, an assault.

‘This is someone you have kissed goodbye on the way to work this morning and now you have been told they are dead. 

‘Decision-making for families in these circumstances is desperately difficult and desperately unstable.

‘This is not (about obtaining) a “yes” at any cost. It is about getting the right person there to give the family the best possible support, even if they say no.’

The guidelines, published this year, tell staff to avoid phrases such as ‘I am asking you because it is policy’ or ‘I am sorry to have to ask you’.

Support: Staff are being encouraged to tell grieving families that, by becoming a donor their relative has a chance to save lives (picture posed by model)

They should use positive language, such as ‘by becoming a donor your relative has a chance to save and transform the lives of many others’.

The guidance adds that relatives are less likely to refuse if the topic is breeched sensitively.

‘The consistent message from the available evidence is that approaching families in certain ways arbitrarily prompts a premature refusal, and that avoiding such pitfalls can result – quite legitimately – in improved rates of family consent,’ it adds.

It tells staff to question relatives if they do initially refuse.

They are encouraged to ask them: ‘How do you think your husband would feel about organ donation?’ 

The NHS Blood and Transplant Authority says relatives normally only override patients’ wishes when they had no idea that they were on the donor register.

This summer the organisation announced that it was considering giving registered donors priority on waiting lists for transplants.

But critics warn this could unfairly discriminate against those who don’t want to sign up because of strong religious or ethical views.

In July, the Welsh Government passed a law meaning that from 2015 everyone will be on the organ donor register unless they opt-out.
