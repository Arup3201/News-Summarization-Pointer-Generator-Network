Former CIA director David Petraeus was recently harassed by an angry mob of students as he walked to his first day of teaching at City University of New York's honors college. 

Students surrounded the four-star general on a sidewalk and yelled 'War criminal!' and 'You have blood all over you!' according to a video of the confrontation that was posted on YouTube. 

Some of the students could be seen throwing their fists in the air and getting in his face, but Petreaus maintains a straight face and continues walking without responding to their taunts.

'Petraeus out of CUNY!' they chant in the video, which was first reported by Business Insider. 'Every class, David. Every class!'

At one point, Petraeus walks into oncoming traffic in an apparent attempt to lose the group.

Petraeus is teaching a class at CUNY called, 'Are We on the Threshold of the North American Decade?'

He took the teaching job after resigning from his position at the helm of the CIA last year following revelations that he had an extramarital affair with his biographer, Paula Broadwell. 

Broadwell, meanwhile, received a warm welcome from her local community in Charlotte, North Carolina on Tuesday after giving a speech to the Charlotte Rotary Club. It was her first address since her affair became public. 

Broadwell spoke about her commitment to helping veterans acclimate to civilian life - especially those who have been wounded in combat.

notoriety from her affair with David Petraeus to draw attention to the 
work that needs to be done to help veterans as they return home from war

Latest endeavor: Broadwell is trying to involve 
local businesses and groups in creating a better environment for 
returning soldiers to find medical treatment and job opportunities

'Our soldiers have given so much,' Broadwell said, according to the Charlotte Observer. 'Now we need to give back to them.'

Speaking to reporters after the address, Broadwell said she is also interested in galvanizing a 'fitness movement' in Charlotte.

She did not specifically address her affair with Petraeus, though she referenced a recent 'personal crisis.'

'In my experience as well, you can't survive a personal crisis without a little help from your friends and a community which can help you rebuild personally and professionally,' she said, according to WBTV.
