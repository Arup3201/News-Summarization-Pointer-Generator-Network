The U.S. government spied on major human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, the whistleblower Edward Snowden has claimed.

He told Europe's largest human rights watchdog that the National Security Agency had 'specifically targeted either leaders or staff members' in a large number of groups.

Mr Snowden's evidence - via video link from Moscow, where he has been in hiding since last year - came as he mocked claims he had taken 1.7million documents as a 'scare number' with no meaning.

Allegations: Edward Snowden appeared before the Council of Europe via video link from Moscow

Mr Snowden said 'trillions' of private communications were monitored, including those of human rights groups

The NSA whistleblower spoke for more than an hour to the Council of Europe, a human rights group with 47 member states.

He defended his decision to leak thousands of documents, saying: 'My motivation is to improve government, not to bring it down.'

Despite the changes which had been made because of his revelations, he said: 'I remain in a position of significant legal jeaopardy'.

He was then asked if the U.S. had tracked 'highly sensitive and confidential communications' of groups including - but not limited to - Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.

He told council members: 'Without question - yes, absolutely they do.

'The NSA has in fact specifically targeted the communications of either leaders or staff members in a number of purely civil or human rights organisations of the kind described in the question, including domestically within the borders of the United States.'

In an interview before the hearing, the whistleblower - whose first claims emerged in June last year - said U.S. officials were exaggerating when they said he stole 1.7million documents.

He told Vanity Fair magazine it was 'simply a scare number based on an intentionally crude metric - everything that I ever digitally interacted with in my career.'

He added: 'Every single one of those officials knows I don’t have 1.7million files, but what are they going to say?

'What senior official is going to go in front of Congress and say, "We have no idea what he has, because the N.S.A.’s auditing of systems holding hundreds of millions of Americans’ data is so negligent that any high-school dropout can walk out the door with it?"'

Mr Snowden, 30, left his job as an NSA
 contractor and fled to Hong Kong before his revelations on mass 
surveillance were first published last summer.

When charges were filed against him he left Hong Kong for Moscow, where he was trapped in the Russian capital's airport for more than a month before being granted temporary asylum.

Yesterday's hearing in Strasbourg saw several council members criticise U.S. tactics and call for an end to indiscriminate data collection.

It came on the day the European Court 
of Justice struck down EU data protection rules, saying they caused 
'particularly serious interference' with the right to a personal life 
and personal data.

In his evidence Mr Snowden also criticised the British spy agency GCHQ, and reminded members the NSA collected countless explicit images - including from webcams.

He said 'trillions' of communications were intercepted, adding: 'The vast majority had no intelligence value at all and roughly 10 per cent of images were intensely private, depicting nudity or other intimacy.'

Anger: Several members of the council used the platform to condemn mass surveillance by the U.S.

Authoritarian: Mr Snowden warned regimes could compile, for example, a list of 'all the Christians in Egypt'

People's sexual orientation was already being collected without their knowledge, with horrific potential consequences if an authoritarian regime obtained the same technology.

He gave the example of making a list of 'all the Christians in Egypt'.

The court in the U.S. which approved data access was held in secret and was unaccountable to the public, he added.

'Human rights can only be protected if we ensure that our laws have a clear meaning and the meaning of the words within those laws can not be secretly interpreted by any legal body or intelligence agency without the public's consent,' he said.

Dutch centre-right MP Pieter Omtzigt told Euronews: 'The United States is always saying they want to protect human rights defenders. But if they have a special program to eavesdrop on Amnesty International or the United Nations Children's Fund, there might be a potential problem.'

The council invited the White House to give evidence, but it declined.

A senior judge has launched an investigation into how Britain's police and spy agencies access citizens' private information.

Interception of communications 
commissioner Anthony May launched the investigation after finding British authorities were given permission to access phone records and e-mails more than half a million times last year.

He said he had also studied Mr Snowden's claims, but found no evidence of 'indiscriminate mass intrusion'.

However, he added: 'It seems to me to be a very large number. It has the feel of being too many.

'My office is in the process of undertaking an inquiry into whether there might be an institutional overuse of authorisations to acquire communications data.'

A Home Office spokesman said the review was welcome but stressed: 'Communications data has played a significant role in every major security service counter-terrorist operation over the last decade, and is used in 95 percent of all serious and organised crime investigations.'
