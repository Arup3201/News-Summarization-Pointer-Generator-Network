Unsuccessful: Charles Edwards tried to fight against the state's decision over his sexual encounter with an 18-year-old student but the court rejected his appeal

A former teacher who appealed his conviction for having consensual sex with an 18-year-old student has lost.

The Kansas Court of Appeals upheld a state law designed to prevent sexual relations between teachers and students.

Charles Edwards, who had been the choir teacher at Wichita Northwest High School, argued he should be held to the same standards as professors at university campuses who are allowed to have sex with their students.

The court disagreed, stating in its 
report: 'While it is true that both situations involve learning 
environments, the circumstances are hardly comparable.'

It continued: 'High school attendance
is mandatory... while attendance at college is voluntary. Most of the 
children attending K-12 schools are minors.'

Edwards said the law infringed on his right to have consensual sex with a consenting adult in his home.

He was charged with having sex with the student in March 2010 and then placed on probation after being found guilty.

State law says having sexual contact with a student at your school is a low-level felony for a teacher or person in position of authority.

The ruling acknowledged Edwards' defence but disagreed with it.

'Teachers are in a unique position to groom or coerce students into exploitative or abusive conduct,' it read.

'The state must provide a safe school environment for students, which includes preventing the sexual exploitation of students.

'A sexually charged learning environment would confuse, disturb, and distract students, thus undermining the quality of education in Kansas.'

The ruling continued: 'Students very well may not have the necessary level of maturity to remove themselves from a sexually charged situation.'
