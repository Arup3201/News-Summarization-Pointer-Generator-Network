Outspoken: Miriam O'Reilly has attacked the BBC over its attitude to older women

Former Countryfile presenter Miriam O'Reilly has launched a scathing attack on the BBC - claiming she was greeted with a 'hostile attitude' upon returning to the organisation after winning an employment tribunal against them.

Ms O'Reilly won her case for age discrimination against the BBC after she was dropped from the popular TV series three years ago.

But she claims she continued to be treated unfairly when she returned to the organisation to present Crimewatch Roadshow and was forced to leave just nine-months into a three year contract.

This latest accusation comes shortly after the new director general of the BBC, George Entwistle, vowed to put more older women on shows. In a 1,800-word letter to the BBC's head of complaints, Ms O'Reilly argued that all apologies and offers of work from Mr Entwistle and his predecessor Mark Thompson were just 'a PR damage-limitation exercise'.

According to the Guardian, she wrote that it was 'clear that I was not going to receive fair treatment' and alleged that a member of the production team 'appeared to be on a mission to humiliate and undermine my confidence'.

She continued: 'On one occasion he was cueing me as 'Hayley' during a live broadcast and laughing.

'When we came off air and I asked him why, he said it was because I reminded him of Hayley Cropper, a transsexual character in Coronation Street. I objected but the following day a picture of Hayley Cropper had been stuck to my sound pack for all to see.'

Mr Entwistle said not enough had been done to promote female experts or ensure that they took part in news programmes.

He said: ‘We have made real progress in actively looking for, and finding, great female experts to front our big factual shows, but it’s not enough, and the world will always be profoundly demanding of the BBC on this question, and it should be.

‘The Today programme struggles because we are dealing with party politics as it is, dealing with the world as it is, and that’s a very male place. What the BBC often reflects is the way the world is.’

In an interview with the Radio Times, he claimed progress had been made with female presenters such as Mary Beard of Meet the Romans and Lucy Worsley of Antiques Uncovered.

And the director-general said he would love to see the return of Miriam O’Reilly, the presenter who won an age discrimination case against the broadcaster after she was dropped from Countryfile.

So her latest remarks will comes as a bit of a blow.

Ms O'Reilly also complained that she not been invited to take part in discussions on ageism on BBC shows following her employment tribunal win.

She wrote: 'This cumulative action is not what one would expect of a fair and balanced BBC, but it clearly shows the level of animosity which exists and which has denied me my career.

'I won my case unanimously, but the attitude of some executives following my return to work shows a contempt for the law. The way I've been treated isn't worthy of the BBC, or what the BBC stands for.'

A BBC spokesman said: 'The BBC has apologised both privately and publicly to Miriam for what happened to her and, as an organisation, we have made sure we learned lessons from it. As recently as this week George Entwistle said he would welcome Miriam back to the BBC if she had a great idea for a programme – the same challenge he has laid down to programme-makers nationwide.

'It would not be right however for Miriam to appear on every single debate about ageism across the BBC as it would risk limiting the range of voices and opinions that audiences could hear.'
