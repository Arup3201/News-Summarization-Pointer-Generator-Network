The living descendants of King Richard III have joined the campaign to demand that his remains are reburied in York.

The monarch’s 500-year-old skeleton was identified this month after it was found by an archaeological dig at a council car park in Leicester last year.

Richard III grew up in the Yorkshire Dales and visited York several times in his 26-month reign. A petition calling for him to be re-interred there has more than 23,000 signatures.

A facial reconstruction was done of Richard III after his body was found at a Leicester car park. Now the descendants of the last Plantagenet King, pictured right, want his remains to be reburied in York

Despite this, his remains are due to be re-interred at  Leicester Cathedral next year.

In a statement, nine of his descendants – including his 17th-generation great-nephews and nieces and 16th great-nieces and nephews – said: ‘Richard III was the last King of the House of York.

'We do hereby most respectfully demand that the remains of King Richard III, our mutual ancestor, be returned to the city of York for formal, ceremonial reburial.

‘We believe that such an interment was [his] desire in life and we have written this statement so that his wishes may be fully recognised and upheld.

'King Richard III was the last King of
the House of York and the last of the Plantagenet dynasty which had 
ruled England since the succession of King Henry II in 1154.'

They
continued: 'We, the under-named blood descendants, unreservedly believe
that King Richard is deserving of great recognition and respect and 
hereby agree to dutifully uphold his memory.

The body, complete with hump, was discovered in a car park by Leicester University archeologists

The body will be buried at Leicester Cathedral. More than 23,000 have signed a petition opposing the move

'With due humility and affection, we are and will remain his Majesty’s representatives and voice.'

Earlier this month, city leaders in 
York said they were to write to the Queen and the Ministry of Justice  
in a bid to get Richard III’s remains returned to his 'spiritual home'.

King Richard grew up at Middleham Castle in the Yorkshire Dales and visited York several times during his 26-month reign.

Known as Richard of York before his coronation, he also funded part of the city’s medieval gated walls.

The
monarch’s links with the area are celebrated to this day, with a 
Richard III Hotel in Middleham, a Yorkshire-made Richard III Wensleydale
cheese and a Richard III Museum in York.

The Ministry of Justice has said the site was the University of Leicester’s decision because it had been granted permission to exhume the body.
