'Andre Claus' is back.

Houston Texans' receiver Andre Johnson took 11 children from the Harris County Department of Family and Protective Services to Toys 'R' Us on Tuesday and gave them 80 seconds to pick out whatever they wanted.

The speedy shopping spree, which racked up a staggering bill of $16,266.66, marked the eighth consecutive year that the NFL star has treated local underprivileged children to holiday gifts.

'Me and my uncle were sitting in the house one day and I was like, "I want to do something for Christmas",' he explained to the Houston Chronicle.

'And he was just like, "Have you ever thought about having kids go through Toys 'R' Us and get what they want?" And I was just like, "Naw, I never really thought about that".

'He was like, "Give 'em 80 seconds to run through the store and let 'em just get what they want." And I was like, "That's not enough time." And he was like, "They can grab a lot".'

And this year, they proved it more than ever - as the children, who are aged between eight and 16, picked out goodies including WWE action figures, Barbies and soft toys from the movie Frozen.

The presents were in addition to a bike, a gaming system each and two games.

Johnson, 33, explained that they collected these separately because the items are locked up so the kids can't get their hands on them during their sprees.

'As a kid, to get to run through the store - get whatever you want - I'm pretty sure it's kind of breathtaking for them,' Johnson said. 

The bewildered children were also joined by Texans dancers, who helped them pick out their gifts and load up their carts.

Johnson was also helped by his uncle, who kept an eye on the stopwatch and kept the kids updated with how much time they had left.

He also needed to nip out to the car when Johnson realized he'd forgotten his wallet.

The items were scanned at four different registers and then handed back to the grinning kids. Johnson spent so much that he earned gift cards.

When CBS asked Andre Claus what he wanted for Christmas, he didn't hesitate.

'My Christmas gift would be getting into the playoffs and see what happens after that,' he said.

While off the field, the NFL star, who has 65 catches for 720 yards and two touchdowns so far this season, focuses his attention on charitable causes.

In 2003, he founded the Andre Johnson Foundation to raise funds and give support to children and teens growing up in single-parent homes.

The football player, who is worth an estimated $20 million, has a four-year-old daughter with a former girlfriend.
