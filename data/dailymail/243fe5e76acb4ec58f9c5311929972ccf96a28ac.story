Mystery has deepened around the eight-tonne Earth-observing Envisat satellite after the satellite fell silent - and has failed to enter the 'safe mode' expected of ailing space vehicles.

In 'safe mode', it would use its power to angle its solar panels towards the sun. Without it, it could fail permanently.

Scientists and engineers are scrambling to pinpoint the problems afflicting the satellite - radar images from Earth appear to show that it's intact.

If no other solution is found, a high-resolution imaging satellite, Pleiades, will scan the craft on Sunday.

'After 10 years of service, Envisat has stopped sending data to Earth. ESA's mission control is working to re-establish contact with the satellite,' says the European Space Agency

'We continue to try to re-establish 
contact with the satellite, and to collect more information on the 
satellite's status by ground radar images, from optical images, from 
telescopes, but also from other spacecraft,' said Professor Volker 
Liebig of ESA.

The satellite failed to radio to its 
controllers on April 8 - and a team of engineers, scientists and mission
 operators are now attempting to restore contact with the satellite.

"On Sunday, will try to program the satellite Pleiades to see if they 
can image Envisat, to give us more detailed knowledge on whether there 
is damage on the outside,' he said.

'After 10 years of service, Envisat has stopped sending data to Earth. ESA's mission control is working to re-establish contact with the satellite,' says the European Space Agency.

'The first sign that there was a problem came on 08 April when contact with the satellite was unexpectedly lost, preventing the reception of any data as it passed over the Kiruna ground station in Sweden.'

The
 eight-tonne Envisat had a planned lifetime of five years, but has 
doubled that - and the European Space Agency has celebrated the 
anniversary with a gallery of the unforgettable imagery captured by 
Envisat's eight sensors.

More than 2,000 scientific publications have been based on Envisat data.

Envisat's data has been used in 4,000 science projects in 70 countries, including landmark research into climate change.Its study of ocean currents was used last year to simulate dispersal of nuclear pollution from the Fukushima accident, and it gained real-time images of the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.

With ten sophisticated 
optical and radar sensors, the satellite continuously observes and 
monitors  Earth’s land, atmosphere, oceans and ice caps.

In 2010, the satellite’s orbit was changed to allow Envisat to continue operating for at least another three years - so its sudden silence is a worry for its ground team.

Its replacement -– the Sentinels – will become fully operational in
 2013.

Envisat’s
 largest instrument is the Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar, which can 
be used day or night because it sees through clouds and darkness.

This is particularly useful over polar regions, which are prone to long periods of bad weather and extended darkness.   Other
 instruments include the Radar Altimeter, which measures surface 
topography to an accuracy of a few centimetres, revealing the changes in
 sea-surface height over time.
