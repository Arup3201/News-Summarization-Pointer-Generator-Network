The U.S. military's latest drone will be able to roam and kill from a distance of 1,800 miles.

In development since 2009, the General Atomics Avenger is expected to have a top speed of more than 500mph, a 50,000ft operational ceiling and will be able to operate for up to 18 hours at a time.

The news comes after Chuck Hagel, the defense secretary, announced plans to reduce the nation's army to its smallest size since before World War Two.

This is the U.S. military's latest drone, the General Atomics Avenger, which will be able to kill from 1,800 miles

News of the drone's ability comes after U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel announced plans to reduce the nation's army to its smallest size since before World War Two

Under Mr Hagel's plan, which could be rejected by Congress, the active-duty army would shrink from 522,000 soldiers to between 440,000 and 450,000. This would be its smallest size since 1940.

The proposal comes after President Obama's pledge to end two long-term military campaigns, including in Afghanistan.

The U.S. could be forced to remove all troops from Afghanistan by president Hamid Karzai by the end of this year.

According to Gizmodo, because of the forced pull-out, Afghanistan's remote regions are now out of range to conventional unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), making interdiction against the military in this area almost impossible.

And without the use of Afghan airbases, which require protection from the military, conventional UAVs will not be able to continue surveillance and strike operations in north-west Pakistan. The Taliban has grown in this area since the U.S. announced it was pulling out of Afghanistan.

The Avenger will be used to help the U.S. military gain access to areas that would otherwise be unreachable using conventional models.

According to the Los Angeles Times, President Obama is also making contingency plans to use air bases in Central Asia where drone missile attacks on north-west Pakistan can be conducted.

The new Avenger is a third-generation prototype of the Predator drone system. It uses a turbofan engine rather than a conventional turboprop, unlike its predecessors.

The Avenger will match or better the capabilities of the Reaper, according to Gizmodo, with a top speed of at least 500mph, a 50,000ft operational ceiling and an operating time of 18 hours.

It will also be the same length as the Reaper – with a 65ft wingspan – and will carry the same weapon load-out.
