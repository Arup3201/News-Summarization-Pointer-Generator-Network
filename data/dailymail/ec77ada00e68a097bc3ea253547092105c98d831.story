A high school senior in Oregon was killed at the weekend after being knocked from a train bridge and falling into a river while walking home from a party celebrating the last day of school.

Taishawn Nathaniel Millage, 18, was set to graduate on Wednesday and had attended a party for Roosevelt High seniors when the incident happened around 11:15 pm Friday.

The student was walking along St. Johns Bridge in Portland when he was knocked by a train into the Willamette River below.

A medical examiner ruled on Monday that the cause of death was drowning.

Millage had been at a bonfire along the river with his peers when he wandered off alone, according to people at the gathering

'At the end of the day, it doesn't make sense,'Â  neighbor Herman Greene told Oregon Live.

'This wasn't a teenager who was rebellious,' he said.

'This was an 18-year-old who was just coming into who he was.

'He was doing what he needed to do in the classroom.

'He was starting to make the stuff click.

'He loved people, and people loved being around him.'

Taishawn spoke of starting a music career and studying graphic design
