A 'giant rat' measuring 4ft from nose to tail has been caught and killed by a pensioner with a lump of wood on his farm.

Brian Watson, 67, from Waskerley, Consett in County Durham, was made aware of the monster's presence after his granddaughter's boyfriend cried out while mowing the grass.

Mr Watson said: 'I heard him shouting there was a large rat. I came running round the corner. I managed to grab some wood on the way.'

Death threats: Brian Watson, 67, from Waskerley in County Durham has been targeted by animal rights activists after this picture of him holding a 'giant rat' he had killed emerged last month

The creature was so heavy that Mr Watson broke a paddle when trying to scoop it up

'It wasn't very fast. I managed to kill it there and then. I've never seen a rat as big in my life before.'

One reason it was quite slow is that it might have been pregnant.

'I think it was due to drop young 'uns,' Mr Watson added.

Some observers believe the creature was a coypu - a large South American rodent, also known as a river rat or swamp beaver, which is bred for its fur.

Some believe the animal was in fact a coypu, a South American rodent bred for its fur

After killing it, the grandfather tried to scoop it up with a paddle - but it was so heavy that the paddle broke.

The
 incident first came to light when Mr Watson's friend, Bri Mitchell, 
posted a picture of the rodent after it had been caught, on Twitter.

Mr Watson said: 'We left it for a few days, but word got round so we decided to destroy it and we chucked it on the fire and got rid of it that way.'

The RSPCA is seeking further information on the incident from members of the public.

A spokesman for the charity said: 'We would urge anyone with more information about this incident to contact our cruelty line and we will look into it further.'

Durham Police said today that they are not currently investigating the killing of the animal.
