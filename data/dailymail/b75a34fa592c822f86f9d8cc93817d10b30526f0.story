Cash-strapped Air India is putting fewer passengers on its long-haul flights from Mumbai to America – and losing more money – because the type of aircraft used on that route is at risk of hitting the city’s mega-sized billboards.

The gigantic signs are blocking the flight path at Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, creating a significant hazard for Boeing 777-300ER aircraft that are too heavy to clear them while carrying full loads of passengers and fuel.

In order to lighten the load, Air India is leaving 51 seats empty on its 16-hour, non-stop flights from Mumbai to Newark, New Jersey, Bloomberg reported.

The twin-engine 777-300ER can carry a total of 365 passengers but it is flying at 15 per cent below capacity on Air India’s Mumbai-Newark route.

That means the airline is losing nearly £1million per month, according to G.M. Siddeshwara, India’s junior aviation minister.

The situation is adding to the woes of debt-laden Air India, which hasn’t turned a profit since 2006 and required a £2billion government bailout in 2012.

Towering billboards appear in clusters throughout Mumbai, selling everything from the latest Bollywood films and fashion to mobile phone deals and upcoming events.

Air India complained about 15 signs near the airport but two are still standing in the way thanks to litigation, Bloomberg reported. 

Thirteen have been removed. 

The billboards are not an obstruction for United Airlines, which flies the same route using the smaller Boeing 777-200.
