A California police dog critically injured by an armed murder suspect on Sunday night has been reunited with his handler and is expected to make a full recovery.

K-9 Reiko was rushed to the TLC Pet Medical Center in South Pasadena after being shot in the neck at around 11.30pm as open fire erupted in nearby West Covina.

Thankfully vets were able to remove a bullet lodged dangerously close to Reiko's spine and no lasting damage was done.

The two-year-old German Shepherd was greeted by his owner, officer Bryan Rodriguez, yesterday.

Vets said as soon as Reiko saw his 'best buddy', his 'eyes lit up.'

'What a great team', they added.

Reiko will now rest up at home with officer Rodriguez until he is given the all clear. He is expected to return to duty in a few weeks.

The area around his spine remains sore and he must wear a large collar around his head to prevent him from scratching stitches.

West Covina Police corporal, Rudy Lopez, thanked the team at TLC Pet Medical Center for their speedy action.

'Their top-tier skill level absolutely saved Reiko's life,' he said in a statement.

Police say the drama unfolded after a shooting victim was found dead on the lawn outside a church near Sunset Avenue and Badillo Street in West Covina.

A witness described the gunman and a thorough search of the area was conducted, with a helicopter leading the effort.

The suspect was spotted on the roof of a home and started shooting in the direction of officers but hit Reiko instead.

Kitted out: The police department now wants to acquire protective body armor for the entire K-9 dog unit, to minimize the number of injuries

Police fired back, killing the gunman. Police on Tuesday identified the suspect as 27-year-old Juan Jose Enriquez of Azusa and the man he allegedly killed as Erick Arcadio Moreno, 24, of Pomona.

The incident is currently under investigation and it remains unclear what triggered the chain of events.

No West Covina police officers were injured in either shooting. Reiko has been with the force since 2013.

The police department received community donations and contributions to purchase and train the canine.

It now wants to acquire protective body armor for the entire K-9 dog unit, to minimize the number of injuries.
