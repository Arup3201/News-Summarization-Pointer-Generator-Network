Fifty homes were evacuated yesterday by police who believed they had discovered terrorist explosives – but they turned out to be homemade fireworks.

Bomb disposal experts rushed to the scene in Mexborough, near Doncaster, and a 55-year-old man was arrested. But South Yorkshire Police said later they did not now believe there was a terror link. 

A spokesman  said: ‘We think it’s a 
case of someone making fireworks but until we assess exactly what the 
materials are we’re not clear on his exact intent.’

South Yorkshire Police said the evacuation was taking place in Mexborough, near Doncaster

The man was arrested on suspicion of possessing explosives
 following concerns that prompted the evacuation of around 50 homes.

Officers were acting on information that a local man had been buying items which could be explosive if put together.

A spokeswoman said yesterday: 'Residents are 
currently being evacuated from Chestnut Grove in Mexborough, and the 
surrounding area, following the discovery of potentially hazardous 
material at a property.

'A cordon has been put in place while the material is assessed, to ensure the safety of the public.

'Officers from South Yorkshire Police and partner agencies, including South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service, are currently at the scene.

'South Yorkshire Police would like to thank members of the public for their patience and co-operation while inquiries continue.'

Kathryn Pearson, who lives in the affected area, told the BBC: 'At 10 this morning the policeman putting the tape up told me I had to evacuate my house for up to 24 hours - and that was that'

Doncaster Council set up a rest centre at Mexborough Day Centre for residents until they were able to return to their homes.

 Pearson, who lives in the affected area, told the BBC: 'At 10 this 
morning the policeman putting the tape up told me I had to evacuate my 
house for up to 24 hours - and that was that.

'It must be something serious but obviously it's frustrating for me.'

Speaking at the scene, Superintendent Liz Watson said officers had acted on information that a local man had been buying items which could be explosive if put together.

She said: ‘The police had received some information regarding a gentleman that lives in the local area that's been purchasing hazardous material.

‘That gentleman has been arrested and this morning police forensic officers have come to do a specialist search of his home address.

‘On entering there they've found a number of hazardous materials that potentially could be explosive.

‘Because of that we've had to seal off that address and evacuate a number of residents until we can be sure that there's nothing that's likely to explode or cause any harm to occupants or neighbours in that vicinity.’

A large area around the street has been cordoned off and a number of police vehicles and ambulances were parked at the nearby Highwoods pub.

Ms Watson said: ‘At the address at the moment we've got the Army bomb disposal unit along with fire and rescue specialists and forensic specialists just looking at what material there is there and recover those items.

‘We're hoping the search will finish later on this evening so we can then get residents back home.’

The officer said some families had gone to stay with relatives but others were being looked after at a family centre in Mexborough.

She said Doncaster Council helped in the operation, which was made more difficult as a number of those evacuated were vulnerable OAPs.

‘Obviously there's quite a bit of concern that this is happening within their local area and one of their neighbours is potentially making what we believe are explosives,’ Ms Watson said.

‘Being turfed out of their homes on a Saturday morning - in particular some vulnerable elderly people - it obviously caused some upset in the community.

‘I think they realise the seriousness of it and the fact that we're having to do this to protect them and make sure no-one comes to harm.’
