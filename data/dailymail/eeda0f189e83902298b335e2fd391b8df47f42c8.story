David Cameron said a commitment to strengthening the single market was 'written like a stick of rock through all of the conclusions that we now sign up to'

David Cameron today insisted Britain had nothing to fear from a two-speed EU, as countries using the single currency moved ever closer.

The Prime Minister hopes to use greater integration among eurozone countries to secure a 'better deal' for Britain, bringing some powers back from Brussels.

A new banking watchdog will oversee the 17 countries using the euro, but those outside will not be affected, under a deal agreed in Brussels today.

The agreement will prevent eurozone 
countries from ganging up on those that have not adopted the single 
currency – and protect the City of London from financial regulations 
drawn up by the debt-stricken bloc.

After
14 hours of talks, eurozone countries agreed that the European Central 
Bank should directly supervise 200 banks – none of which are British – 
in the most far-reaching step towards a single-currency superstate since
the euro crisis began.

Speaking in Brussels today, Mr Cameron said: 'What you’ll see is a growth of this 
multi-faceted Europe and I don’t think it’s something we should be 
frightened of at all, I think we should be very confident.'

He also backed talks on strengthening the single
market, which he said was now 'written like a stick of rock through all
of the conclusions that we now sign up to'.

In future, eurozone banking regulations will have to be approved by a majority of the bloc’s members, as well as a majority of those EU members outside it.

This voting system means that a two-tier Europe – long talked of by diplomats – is now the reality.

Mr Cameron hailed the agreement as proof that Britain can safeguard its national interests while letting other European countries pursue an economic and monetary union.

He said Britain now has ‘opportunities’ to fight for ‘a better deal’, with the summit marking the ‘start of some important conversations where Britain can do better’.

The Prime Minister is due to make a speech in the new year spelling out the kind of relationship he wants with the EU, as well as promising a referendum on any new deal.

Last night he was locked in talks with fellow EU leaders as they discussed a blueprint for further integration, which is expected to lead to some countries pooling their debts and agreeing their budgets centrally after 2014.

European Commission president Jose Manuel Barroso suggested that the banking union, agreed in the early hours yesterday, was the start of a United States of Eurozone.

‘We are going to have powers at central level in Europe, through the ECB, very comparable to the United States,’ he said.

Chancellor George Osborne described the agreement as ‘a good deal for Britain and a good deal for Europe’.

‘I think it’s a bit of a model of the way Britain’s relationship with Europe is going to work in the future,’ he added. ‘The eurozone is going to do more integration but Britain is going to protect its interests, and it is not going to give any more rights and powers to Brussels.’

However, Lord Harrison, of the Lords EU Sub-Committee on Economic and Financial Affairs, said he would summon ministers to ensure the deal is watertight.

‘The Government appear satisfied with the safeguards they have won in ensuring that the interests of the single market are defended – but the devil is in the detail,’ he insisted.

‘The implications of these important first steps towards a banking union could be momentous for the UK, even though we will not be participating.

‘We will be inviting the minister to meet with us early in the new year to explore the ramifications of last night’s deal.’
