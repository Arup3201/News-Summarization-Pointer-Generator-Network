Gordon Strachan last night tipped the Tartan Army to transform Celtic Park into a Scotland cauldron.

A happy hunting ground for Irish trio Martin O’Neill, Roy Keane and Aiden McGeady in the past, former Scotland skipper David Weir claimed the SFA should have plumped for Ibrox to host the crucial Euro 2016 qualifier, instead.

A key figure in persuading the governing body to go for the biggest possible capacity, however, Strachan claims Celtic’s home will be transformed into ‘Scotland’ Park for the night.

‘Tomorrow, that’s Scottish territory and you’ll know it’s Scottish territory,’ said the national manager.

‘There will be 55,000 Scots fans in there. You’ll be in no doubt where you are tomorrow. You’re in Scotland and Scotland are playing … against Ireland.’

Denying there is any kind of advantage for key Ireland figures in playing the match at a venue where some have experienced Champions League nights first hand, former Celtic boss Strachan expects a very different experience this evening.

Steven Naismith has been in good form for Everton and will lead Scotland's attack against the Irish 

‘It’s different people,’ he insisted. ‘I believe the atmosphere will be terrific but in a different way.

‘There are a lot of things that will be different. Tomorrow is Scotland.

‘I think the big nights, I know what is coming, it will inspire all the players. It will manage to get another few per cent out of them.

‘They can drink all the water they want, eat all the carbohydrates they want but the extra bit tomorrow will come from our fans.’

Former Rangers and Scotland skipper Weir disagreed, saying: ‘If I’m being honest, this game should have been at Ibrox. That would have been more of an advantage for Scotland.

‘The game is where it is, so we can use that as an excuse or we can use it as a motivation to help us win. The stadium doesn’t win the game, the players win the game and the performance wins the game, but I think the game should have been at Ibrox to give us a little bit of help.’

The Scots defeated Georgia 1-0 in a home qualifier at Ibrox last month. Revealing he had a big say in opting for the bigger venue for the Irish game, however, Strachan added: ‘I was part of the decision and now, we’re actually getting more fans in here.

‘I enjoyed the Ibrox experience, I thought it was terrific and I’m going to enjoy this tomorrow. These two games, I think we’ve done the right thing, no matter what the result will be that’s for sure.

‘We’re going to get 55,000 Scotsmen in there tomorrow, we couldn’t have done that anywhere else. That will help us.’

A near 60,000 sell-out, the Ireland game will draw the biggest home crowd for a Scotland international in 25 years.

‘It’s a pat on the back for the players that they’ve generated this interest,’ said Strachan. ‘Because, when the game was announced against England six months ago, that was the big game but it’s been put on the backburner now.’
