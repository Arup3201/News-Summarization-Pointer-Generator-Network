Fun loving: Rosie Kremer pictured at her graduation from university of Cumbria in Health and Education in 2007, she was working as a nursery nurse when she died

A young mother died of an undiagnosed brain tumour six hours after her baby was born by emergency caesarean.

Doctors had insisted throughout months of illness that Rosie Kremer, 24, had labyrinthitis – an inner ear infection.

She lost two stone during pregnancy, was violently sick, slurred her speech and started to lose co-ordination in her limbs.

Yet, according to Miss Kremer’s mother Lesley, at no point during the last two months of her life did any of the 23 doctors who looked at her case indicate that she was gravely ill.

Mrs Kremer, 57, said she later learned that even an hour before her death her daughter could have made a full recovery if her condition had been correctly diagnosed and fluid had been drained from her brain.

She is now suing North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust, which manages Cumberland Hospital in Carlisle.

Mrs Kremer, of Penrith, Cumbria, a part-time teacher, has spoken of her daughter’s plight to promote organ donation. She helped save eight lives after her death.

Miss Kremer, a nursery nurse who graduated from the University of Cumbria in health and education in 2007, began experiencing a loss of appetite, headaches, dizziness and sickness, early on in her pregnancy.

She was declared brain dead at 10.30am on 29 May, 2012 at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Newcastle. She had been transferred there for the delivery after falling into a coma.

Less than six hours earlier, at 4.30am, doctors had delivered her baby boy by emergency caesarean section, Bobby Peter, at 29 weeks. He weighed 2lb14oz. He was finally allowed home last August.

Yesterday Mrs Kremer said  her daughter had been suffering from a haemoblastoma on the brain stem. This is not fatal and, had it been removed, she would have survived.

The tumour could have been there for years, but it is believed the pregnancy accelerated its symptoms.

She spent five weeks in her bedroom unable to move and her mother had to inject her with anti-coagulants.

She was seen in person by 17 doctors, although the total, including phone consultations, was 23.

Moving on: Lesley Kremer has stepped in to raise her grandson Bobby, 15 month, after her daughter Rosie died from an undiagnosed brain tumour just six hours after giving birth to him

The family said there appeared to be no communication between any of the medics and no one to oversee treatment.

Mrs
Kremer said: ‘Rosie went from a beautiful, bright, vivacious girl into 
someone who couldn’t move and just lay there like a vegetable.

‘Before
she died Bobby was brought to her bed and placed on her chest, so there
would at least be some contact with his mother. We took a photograph, 
which is terribly harrowing but when he is older we will show it to him 
to prove that he at least met his mother before she died.’

She added that the family were suing the trust because they want justice for Rosie’s son.

Tragedy: The loss of Rosie's father to cancer 11 years ago made his family aware of the importance of organ donation, Rosie, pictured far left, saved the lives of eight people after her death, with her mum, Lesley, Ruth, dad Peter, and sister Jo

She
said: ‘You put your faith in people but you feel betrayed. The care 
Rosie received was appalling. There was no joined-up care. There was a 
note somewhere about cranial pressure, but despite all her symptoms 
nobody ever diagnosed a tumour. Towards the end she was crying in pain 
and begging to die.

‘Even then nobody was prepared to believe it was anything other than labyrinthitis.

Mrs Kremer is bringing up Bobby as his legal guardian. His father sees him once a week.

'Appalling': Lesley Kremer says she was disgusted by the treatment her daughter received at the hands of the 23 doctors who failed to spot that she had a huge brain tumour

Tragic loss: Rosie's mum Lesley claims she might have made a full recovery if she had been diagnosed even up until the last hour of her life but doctors missed vital signs

Mrs Kremer said that her daughter had given her organs to eight patients.

She is to attend a ceremony at St James’s Palace to collect The Order of St John United Kingdom Award for Organ Donation.

The North Cumbria University Hospitals NHS Trust said it could not comment.
