A 'heartbroken' family have just 24 hours to to flee their home over fears it is about to disappear into a 30ft crater.

Mother of three Leah Coldham faces losing her home to a massive 30ft deep dene hole that has appeared in the front garden of their home in Grays, Essex.

The crater, which is the remains of a cave dug out by Britons hiding from invading Danes in the 1st Century, first appeared as a small hole on Tuesday.

The dene hole in Leah Coldham's garden first appeared on Tuesday morning

However it has since grown 35ft wide and 30ft deep, disrupting the Coldhams' gas and electricity.

A spring has also appeared in the hole, with the water it is leaking causing the crater to widen even faster.

Despite
round the clock efforts by the council and engineers to help the family
they have said that nothing can be done until it stops widening.

Mrs Coldham, 44, has lived in the house with her husband and three children since buying it nine years ago.

The family had a full survey done when they bought the house, but it failed to reveal any potential problems.

And now they have been forced to take
down their Christmas decorations just days after putting them up and 
have been given 24 hours to move their valuables from the stricken house.

It has since swollen to a massive 30ft deep crater and forced the Coldhams to move home 

Dene holes are underground structures formed of a number of small chalk caves accessed by a vertical shaft.

hey date back to the 1st Century and are largely found in chalky ground in Kent and Essex along the lower banks of the River Thames.The holes are believed to have been dug by English fearful of an impending Danish invasion, hence their name.Historians say the chambers, which can be up to 60ft (20m) deep were also used to store grain and extract chalk.

Describing the appearance of the 
crater, Mrs Coldham said: 'It was first thing in the morning I noticed a
little hole, but over the day it got bigger and bigger.

'At the minute its about 30ft wide and 35ft deep. Because of this we have also had a spring appear so we have fresh water coming in and making the hole worse.

'It's probably about 7ft away from my house now and it will be closer in the morning - it just drops and drops.

She added: 'We've been told we have 24 hours to pack up our belongings and get out of the house.

'I've never, ever heard of a dene hole before otherwise I wouldn't have moved into this area.

'I feel absolutely heart-broken. I 
love my home and it's Christmas time as well. I have just put the 
Christmas decorations up and now I have had to take them down.

'We are staying in a hotel tonight 
and trying to look for some accommodation at the minute but it's hard to
find somewhere to move straight away. '

Mrs Coldham had a full survey done when she bought the house - but it failed to uncover the danger

The collapse at the Coldham family home comes after a front garden disappeared in nearby Marlborough Close in October. 

Emergency engineers were called to the Thames-side crater, with the National Grid confirming that there had been at least one gas leak.

Thurrock Council said they were taking 'all necessary precautionary measures' regarding the dene hole, which has been fenced off.

Another dene hole appeared in nearby Marlborough Avenue, Grays in October

Ancient maps show the affected housing estate was built on more than 60 deep holes, most of which are 30ft below ground. 

But there is no information on why the council allowed homes to be built on such a vulnerable location in the first place. 

And infrastructure experts warned there was little that could be done to prevent future collapses. 

National Grid spokesman Raymond Miller said: 'We take problems like this incredibly seriously.'

'It’s not just us who will be affected by this.

'Electrics will be affected. Water will be affected.

'It would be very difficult to put anything preventative in place if the holes have been around for hundreds of years.'

Alistair Baker, from Essex and Suffolk Water, echoed his views, saying: 'There’s very little we can do because you don’t know when or where it’s going to happen.'

Despite the best efforts of engineers nothing can be done until the holes stop widening

Leading geologist Peter Allen, 72, from Cheshunt, Waltham Abbey, is a former president of the Essex Field Club, based in the en Centre, in Wat Tyler Park, Basildon.

He claims Thurrock’s deneholes have been mapped out by the club, which has researched and recorded the county’s biology and geology since 1860.

Mr Allen said: 'Teams of geologists have mapped out deneholes in that area, especially Grays, but a few may have slipped under the radar when studies were undertaken 50 years ago.

'One or two may have escaped our attention and we would love to found out more.

'I find it peculiar that the latest holes have been in people’s front gardens because they can be found anywhere, even under someone’s home.

'Those reporting a denehole should contact their local authority. They would be interested for both historical and safety reasons.'

The dene holes can disrupt gas, electricity and water, and force families out of their homes

Dr Matt Pope, researcher of at Institute of Archaeology, called for improved mapping of deneholes as a ‘high priority’.

He said: 'Deneholes are artificial caves and can be dangerous if they collapse and need to be made safe.

'They are poorly understood and there are many good reasons to investigate them but we need more archaeologists to be interested in them or engineers to carry out surveys if they are building homes and roads.

'Mapping them is important for an engineering and safety point of view and should be a high priority.

'Engineers should be working with local authorities to develop a better understand of the distribution of deneholes and to access the risk to infrastructure and housing.'

Thurrock Council said it was taking 'all necessary precautionary measures.'
