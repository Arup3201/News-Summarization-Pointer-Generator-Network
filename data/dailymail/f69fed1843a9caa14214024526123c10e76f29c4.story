A woman who has battled three types of cancer since the age of 11 has shared a topless picture of herself on Facebook, bravely revealing the tattoo she had inked on her chest following a double mastectomy.

After having her breasts removed to treat her cancer, Kelly Davidson, 34, decided reconstructive surgery was not for her, opting instead to get a fairy tale-inspired tattoo on her chest.

'It's my badge of honor and strength,' the Ontario, Canada resident explained to the Toronto Star. 'It reminds me every day of the battles that I've overcome. I've won this war and hopefully I've beat it completely.'

Inspirational snap: The photo she posted on Why We Ink's Facebook page (pictured) has already received over 700,000 'likes' and has been shared more than 95,000 times

Now Ms Davidson's photo - which was 
posted on Why We Ink's Facebook page on April 4 - has received over 700,000 'likes', and her story has
become an inspiration to other cancer sufferers and survivors.

Ms Davidson was forced to undergo a double mastectomy when she was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 28.

She defeated the disease, but the surgical removal of her breasts was nonetheless traumatic.

'Obviously it's devastating for anyone to lose their breasts, because it defines us as feminine and female,' she told the Ottowa Sun as she posed for a photo shoot for the website. 'But for me, I embraced it.'

Rather than undergoing reconstructive surgery, she decided to accept her new body and proudly commemorate her battle by getting a tattoo where 
her breasts used to be.

'The tattoo represents a metamorphosis, kind of like my new body'

'It represents how I kicked cancer's ass, and how breasts don't define who I am as a person or a woman,' she wrote below her picture. .

The tattoo depicts a fairy in front of a flowing waterfall, with butterflies fluttering in the background.

Ms Davidson explained the symbolism it holds for her: 'The fairy to some degree depicts me,
and the butterflies that are flying away are representing the cancer 
that has left my body,' she said.

'It's a metamorphosis, like a 
transformation, kind of like my new body,' she added.

Fearless: By posing topless, Ms Davidson sent a message of confidence to other women who have had mastectomies. 'I'm still me, I'm still beautiful,' she told the Ottowa Sun. 'I don't need breasts to feel that way'

But breast cancer isn't the only obstacle Ms Davidson has had to overcome in her life.

At the age of 11, she was diagnosed with Hodgkins lymphoma, which she subsequently conquered. And in 2011, she had her thyroid removed after discovering she had papillary thyroid cancer.

'I'm still me, I'm still beautiful. I don't need breasts to feel that way or to portray that to other people'

Despite all her suffering, the optimistic survivor refuses to let it get her down.

'I'm still me, I'm still beautiful,' she said. 'I don't need breasts to feel that way or to portray that to other people.'

To help others in her same situation, Ms Davidson worked at a mastectomy boutique for years, where she offered advice to other women, helping them them adjust to their new bodies and fitting them with prosthetic breasts.

Optimistic: Despite her suffering, she tries to remain positive. 'I'm living and loving life,' she told the Toronto Star. 'I'm not going to let cancer get me down'

She and her fiance Doug Strudwick are 
now looking forward to their wedding this summer, and even in hard times
they try to concentrate on the positive.

'I'm living and loving life. I'm not going to let cancer get me down'

'I'm living and loving life. Iâ€™m not going to let cancer get me down,' she told the Toronto Star, adding: 'If it does come back, I'm just going to keep beating it like I have before.'

Why We Ink, which has garnered over 9,000 'likes', was created for those with memorial or survivor tattoos for cancer to share their body art with others.

Kelly Davidson is just one of the thousands who have turned to social media as an outlet for dealing with the illness. 'It's like a family,' she said of the cancer community. 'It's a club just for us.'
