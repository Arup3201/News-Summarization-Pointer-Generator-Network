Team news 

Liverpool 

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has some big decisions to make for the Champions League clash with Real Madrid as he looks to keep his players fresh for two big games in a week.

Unbeaten Premier League leaders Chelsea are the visitors on Saturday and with domestic form more of an issue at present Rodgers could look to surprisingly rest key players.

Captain Steven Gerrard, at the age of 34, and defender Dejan Lovren have played every minute of all 10 league and three Champions League matches.

Provisional squad: Mignolet, Manquillo, Lovren, Skrtel, Moreno, Gerrard, Allen, Henderson, Sterling, Coutinho, Balotelli, Jones, Johnson, Toure, Enrique, Can, Lucas, Markovic, Lallana, Borini, Lambert.

Brenand Rodgers has some tough selection calls and may not start £20million centre back Dejan Lovren

Karim Benzema has scored in three successive CL appearances (four goals) – he hasn’t scored in four successive CL apps since March 2011.

Liverpool have failed to score in their last two Champions League games, despite attempting 27 shots (inc. blocked). The Reds have not failed to score in three successive CL games since September 2006 (five games).
