Parents were outraged after signs advertising Britain’s first tattoo parlour for children appeared in an empty shop window.

The huge banner appeared at a small Whitstable art gallery advertising a business called ‘My First Tattoo’.

It read: 'Coming soon: My First Tattoo. Britain’s first tattoo parlour for kids! 20% off your child’s first tattoo use code: ART'

Parents were in uproar after signs advertising Britain's first tattoo parlour for children appeared in an empty shop window

Pictures in the shop window in Whitstable, Kent, show 14 different examples of cartoon tattoos, featuring Hello Kitty, Snoopy and the Powerpuff Girls.

Featuring statements such as 'A gift for life, at pocket money prices', the poster understandably provoked shock and outrage in the seaside town.

However, the sign was soon revealed as the work of local artist Sadie Hennessy, who wanted to provoke a debate about children growing up too quickly.

Sadie says the purpose of her stunt was to provoke debate about children growing up too fast

She said: 'I’m not doing it to make a fool out of people I’m just trying to get people thinking about these issues about our children growing up too quickly.

'I was worried by children wearing t-shirts saying Future Porn Star and thongs for young girls and the shifting morality about what is acceptable for our kids.

'Children should be children for as long as they can be.'

Sadie booked the shop window for two weeks and sparked concern among local parents.

Resident Deborah Roberts tweeted: 'Surely this can’t be happening in Whitstable. It’s a joke, right?'

While many residents have failed to see the funny side, Sadie reckons her social experiment is working, as she has already had some enquiries.

She added: 'I’d say the response has been about 50/50 with people getting quite upset about the idea and lots of people have been asking if they can get their children tattooed.

'One man asked if it would hurt for his six-year-old daughter to get a tattoo.

'I knew it would be contentious but you can’t set out to provoke people without people getting provoked.'
