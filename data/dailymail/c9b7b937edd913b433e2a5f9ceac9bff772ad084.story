British couples have more sex in August than any other month, according to a new survey.

Scientists believe this is because sunlight raises levels of the feel-good hormones serotonin and dopamine, and of sex-boosting testosterone.

Previous research has shown that men have up to 33 per cent more testosterone flowing through their bodies in June than in January, and it is known that men with more testosterone have more orgasms.

Britons have more sex in August than any other month. This could be because sunlight raises levels of feel-good hormones, and of testosterone

This is supported by a recent study from the Medical University of Gras in Austria, which revealed that men with more Vitamin D in their blood also have more testosterone in their blood.

As Vitamin D levels can be boosted by sunlight, the researchers concluded that men are more likely to have high testosterone levels in the summer.

The poll, carried out by sex toy company Lovehoney, revealed that August is not the only summer month that inspires love-making â€“ July was found to be the second sexiest month, and June the third.

The researchers believe that other reasons for the increased passion displayed during the summer months could be that people are wearing fewer clothes, and that the sun makes people feel happy and sexy.

They also added that people are given more opportunities to have sex when they are on holiday.

In contrast, the survey found that the winter months are the most sexually desolate, with people having the least sex in the traditionally romantic month of February.

Researchers concluded that this could be because people have more of the hormone melatonin in their bodies in the winter and that this results in lower sex drive, depression and lethargy.

The poll also revealed that 75 per cent of people are happy with their sex life.

Psychologist Professor Cary Cooper, of Lancaster University, said hot weather inspires a feel good factor which makes sex more likely, particularly for women.

Mr Cooper said: 'The effect is partly the opposite of SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder).

'Summer probably has a great effect on women because they can wear such a variety of clothes.

'They can use this to make them feel sexier and better about themselves.

Women are better at interacting with others than men and they feel better when they do.'

A study by scientists at the University of South Brittany in France found that we are also more likely to flirt when the sun is out.

The research showed that girls were more likely to give their phone number out when approached by an attractive male when the weather was good rather than overcast.
