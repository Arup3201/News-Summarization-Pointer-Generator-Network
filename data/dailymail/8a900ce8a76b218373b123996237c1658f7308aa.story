Bison hunting could return to Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon, it has been claimed.

The Nez Perce tribe once hunted bison in what is now Yellowstone National Park, and some tribal leaders want to revive the practice, which ended with Western settlement and the near total extermination of the once-vast U.S. bison herds.

Herds of bison roaming the northern reaches of the Grand Canyon are also causing headaches for park staff as the animals graze in pristine meadows, trample vegetation, damage cliff dwellings and pollute water sources.

The Nez Perce tribe once hunted bison in what is now Yellowstone National Park, and some tribal leaders want to revive the practice.

Yellowstone, a huge park that covers parts of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho and in which hunting is illegal, once made up a key segment of the Idaho tribe's traditional hunting grounds, and some Nez Perce leaders say they should again be able to hunt buffalo inside the park.

'Before there was a park, there was a tribe,' Nez Perce Chairman Silas Whitman said.

'Some of our members already feel we have the right to hunt in the park, but it hasn't been exercised because we feel it would be remiss in going forward that way.'

After asserting hunting rights tied to historic treaties in recent years, the Nez Perce and three other tribes already hunt those bison that follow ancient migration routes outside the park and into Montana in search of winter range.

The Nez Perce have not yet formally requested hunting rights inside the park.

Such a request would require extensive federal review, major changes to Yellowstone policies, and congressional action to modify a founding law that banned hunting or killing of buffalo and other wildlife there.

Killing of animals that wander into Montana in winter in search of food aims to keep in check a herd population whose size is determined by social tolerance rather than the ecosystem's carrying capacity, Yellowstone officials said.

The prospect of hunting any of the 4,000 buffalo within Yellowstone boundaries is strongly opposed by animal advocates, who decry an existing culling program that allows hundreds of bison to be hunted and shipped to slaughter annually.

'Yellowstone is against any proposal to hunt in the park,' said David Hallac, chief of the Yellowstone Center for Resources, the park's science and research branch.

Whitman said the tribe would not force the issue by violating any of the park's regulations but may seek to broach the topic with the U.S. Interior Department, which oversees the national park system, or perhaps lobby Congress 'to request those changes be made'.

The herds of bison roaming the northern reaches of the Grand Canyon are causing headaches for park staff as the animals graze in pristine meadows, trample vegetation, damage cliff dwellings and pollute water sources.

The bison were introduced to northern Arizona in 1906 as part of a ranching operation to crossbreed them with cattle, creating hybrids known as beefalo or cattalo.

The state of Arizona owns and maintains the bison outside the national park, but the animals now are making their home almost exclusively within the boundaries of Grand Canyon National Park.

Federal and state officials are looking at methods to manage the roughly 300 bison in a way that rids them from the park and allows for a free-ranging population that can be hunted on nearby forest land.

On Wednesday, they announced a trio of public meetings to be held in southern Utah and Arizona and a scoping period.

'It's the first step in a long process today,' Grand Canyon Superintendent Dave Uberuaga said.

The massive animals have reduced vegetation in meadows to nubs, traveled into Mexican spotted owl habitat, knocked over walls at American Indian cliff dwellings below the North Rim, defecated in lakes and left ruts in wetlands at the Grand Canyon

'We're just trying to get it out there and get it on everybody's radar screens.'

The bison no longer look like cattle but still have about 10 percent cattle in their genes.

The massive animals have reduced vegetation in meadows to nubs, traveled into Mexican spotted owl habitat, knocked over walls at American Indian cliff dwellings below the North Rim, defecated in lakes and left ruts in wetlands, Uberuaga said.

The iconic symbols of the West can weigh more than 2,000 pounds and run three times faster than humans, the agency has said.

Management methods likely to be brought up during the public scoping period that ends June 6 include baiting, hazing, fencing, relocating the bison and shooting them. Uberuaga said birth control hasn't proven an effective method for controlling the population.

Public meetings are scheduled for April 28 in Kanab, Utah; April 29 in Flagstaff; and April 30 in Phoenix.

Arizona became the owner of the hybrid bison in the northern part of the state after a rancher's experiment to produce a robust type of livestock by breeding cattle with bison largely failed.

The offspring of the animals purchased by the state in 1925 began walking up the Kaibab Plateau in the late 1990s into the national park, seeking better forage.

A bison management plan is expected be issued in the fall of 2016.

Management of Yellowstone bison has stirred controversy for decades.

Killing of animals that wander into Montana in winter in search of food aims to keep in check a herd population whose size is determined by social tolerance rather than the ecosystem's carrying capacity, Yellowstone officials said.

The culling is also designed to ease the worries of Montana ranchers who fear bison will transmit the cattle disease brucellosis, which can cause animals to miscarry, to cows that graze near the park.

That could put into jeopardy Montana's brucellosis-free status, which allows ranchers to ship livestock across state lines without testing.

Marty Zaluski, Montana state veterinarian and member of a state, federal and tribal team that manages bison in and around Yellowstone, is a proponent of hunting in the park and told Reuters in February it needed to be 'looked at more seriously as a possible solution'.

He said it would bring the herd closer to a population target of 3,000 to 3,500 and lessen the public outcry tied to slaughter of wayward buffalo.

But Yellowstone's Hallac contends that hunting in the park, which draws 3 million visitors a year because of tourist attractions such as the Old Faithful geyser and the bison, would further complicate matters.

'Even a proposal to hunt in the park causes more problems than the dilemma it intends to solve,' he said.

'These are America's wildlife and a crucial part of our national heritage.

'To propose to hunt in a place established specifically to prevent animals from being hunted is bizarre.'
