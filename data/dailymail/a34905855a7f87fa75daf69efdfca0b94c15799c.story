Crystal Palace want to hijack Hull's move for Tottenham midfielder Jake Livermore.

Livermore spent last season on loan at the KC Stadium, and manager Steve Bruce wants the midfielder on a permanent deal.

However, Hull are having difficulty in agreeing terms with Tottenham, and Palace are hopeful of swooping in with a move of their own.

Wanted man: Midfielder Jake Livermore is being chased by Hull City and Crystal Palace

Eagles boss Tony Pulis, who is also keen on Spurs defender Michael Dawson, is a fan of Livermore's midfield qualities and has identified as potential summer signing.

Livermore played a key role for Hull last season and is open to the idea of extending his stay with the Tigers.

Despite the arrival of Mauricio Pochettino as new manager at White Hart Lane it is looking increasingly likely the 24-year-old will be allowed to leave Spurs this summer.
