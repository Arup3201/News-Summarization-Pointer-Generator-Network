A 14-year-old schoolgirl has hanged herself after enduring two years of relentless bullying by her female classmates.

Eden Wormer, an eighth grade student at Cascade Middle School in Vancouver, Washington, committed suicide on Wednesday after her efforts at trying to fit in failed.

Her older sister Audri said Eden changed her appearance several times, dying her hair, tanning and getting contact lenses, to get the girls to stop harassing her.

Tormented: Eden Wormer, whose Facebook cover image included the haunting works, 'Right Now The Only Love Of My Life Is Me Myself And I,' took her own life after enduring two years of bullying

But the teen begged her sister not to tell anybody about what she was suffering at the hands of the group of eighth grade girls because she was afraid it would get worse.

The bullying allegedly began when Eden was in the sixth grade, becoming more intense last year, and eventually tipping her over the edge.

‘Halfway through the seventh grade was when it started to get really bad,’ Audri told KATU News.

‘The bullying just kept getting 
worse, and I kept telling her I’m going to do something, I’m going to do
something, and I should have done something.

'I should have just not 
listened to her. I should have done something, because maybe she would have been here. I just want her back.’

Audri recalled Eden's final words: 'She said, "I love you daddy, goodnight," and gave him a kiss and hug, 
and then the next morning he found her dead.'

The grieving sister told why her sister chose to take her own life: 'My sister killed herself because of 
evil, evil people in this world, people that feel like they have to make
fun of other people to make themselves feel better.

'Really, she didn't kill herself, the people that picked on her and treated her like crap and wouldn't accept her, they killed her. They killed her, they broke her down so badly, so emotionally, that she felt like she was nothing, that she had to end her life because she was nothing.'

Eden's older brother, Erin, added: 'Because people don't know what a limit is, I lost part of my family.'

Suicide: Her family and friends say Eden took her own life because her classmates bullied her

Eden often took to her Facebook page to voice her insecurities, writing: 'im super funny and out going i love all my friends n family n that includes all my haterz.! :) n im funn to hang around too. :)'

On February 12,
she wrote: "omg im such a loner i dont have a valentines n the only 
thing im celebrating valentines day with is my bummble bee pillow pet.'

Eden's Facebook page has since been 
flooded with message about bullying. One person posted: 'It’s sad to 
think it took someone to kill themselves for everyone to realize what 
bullying can truly do.'

Another
friend, Samantha Lynn, said: 'I wish it didn't take people this long to
relize [sic] how beautiful you are and how unique you are. You are the 
sweetest girl in the world. I wish you knew you didn't have to fit in. 
It's good to stand out.'

There
was a candlelight vigil in honour of the teen at her school last night.
More than 100 people turned up to pay tribute to the girl they 
described as 'bright' and 'talented', and spoke about their own 
experiences of bullying.

Vancouver police say they have not found any evidence to indicate the bullying rose to the level of a crime.

The
Evergreen School District said it would 
be interviewing students and searching through files to see if Eden ever
reported any physical or emotional abuse.
