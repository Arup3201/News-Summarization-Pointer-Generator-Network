Is Yaya right to be angry over birthday snub?

Yaya Toure has backed his agent Dimitri Seluk's bizarre attack on Manchester City for forgetting the midfielder's birthday and says he will clarify his future after the World Cup.

Seluk cast doubt on the Ivorian staying at the Etihad by saying the influential star was unhappy with the club.

And Toure tweeted: 'My agent was trying to make a point here on my behalf, joke aside.It seems important for me to make a statement.. I am going to do so.

'Everything dimitry said is true. He speaks for me. I will give an interview after world cup to explain.'

Comments: Toure's agent Dimitri Seluk has been in the public eye over the last week

Seluk earlier revealed Brazil legend Roberto Carlos was given a super car by Russian club Anzhi Makhachkala to mark his birthday.

The agent appeared on Sky Sports News on Tuesday afternoon, saying: 'This happened on May 13. Today is May 20.

'Until now nobody from staff called Yaya and said sorry. It was really was not right. It is not a little bit correct.

'If they don't want Yaya, no problem. We can leave any moment, without any problem.'

Toure had attempted to diffuse the row as he tweeted: 'Thanks for all the birthday messages today. Card from City just arrived... Must have got lost in the post. Haha.

'Jokes aside. Please do not take words that do not come out of MY mouth seriously. Judge my commitment to @MCFC by my performances.'

But his later support of Seluk will have City fans concerned about their star man's future. 

Despite a video emerging showing the City players on a plane presenting a cake to Toure - whom the club regard as 'unsellable' - and singing 'Happy Birthday', Seluk told the BBC: 'None of them shook his hand on his birthday. It's really sick, you know.

'He got a cake but when it was Roberto Carlos's birthday, the president of Anzhi gave him a Bugatti.

'I
 don't expect City to present Yaya with a Bugatti, we only asked that 
they shook his hand and said, "We congratulate you". It is the minimum 
they must do when it is his birthday and the squad is all together.

'It
 is an important human relationship to shake hands and say, "Happy Birthday" but nobody did it to Yaya. It shows they don't care about him.

'I
 hear one newspaper has written that City congratulated him from Twitter
 but this is a joke. It is better they don't put anything on Twitter if 
they are not saying anything to him.

'The
 club's owners ate a 100kg cake after winning the Premier League this 
season but when they and the players were all together, none of them 
shook his hand on his birthday.

'If they don't respect him, then easy - Yaya will leave. No problem.'

Upset: Yaya Toure says that no one wished him happy returns at a title celebration party

Speaking in The Sun, Seluk said: 'There is a big possibility Yaya will leave this summer. He is very upset. What happened at his birthday means the club don't care about him. It was proof.

'They can say whatever they want, "Oh we like him but we forgot". Forgot? About Yaya? The player who helped you to be two-time Premier League champions? The guy who helped you win the FA Cup and League Cup?

'In a normal team, his team-mates and club would at least give him good wishes. But when you win the title and two days later you have a big party to celebrate the title and nobody comes to Yaya to say happy birthday, what more do you want?

'If a player like Yaya went to Liverpool and they won the league for the first time in 24 years, Yaya would be a god in Liverpool.

'But at City, Yaya is no hero. He's nobody. That's how the club make him feel. He's very upset and he started thinking about leaving the club. And he will leave if things carry on like this.

'We're not doing this for more money. We probably can go for less money to another club. If they think they can buy everything, they are wrong. I think these people don't care. Only stupid people would want Yaya to leave.'
