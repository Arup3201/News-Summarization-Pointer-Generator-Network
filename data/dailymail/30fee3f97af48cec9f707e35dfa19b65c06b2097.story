While their male counterparts can often be found getting themselves into scrapes and scuffles outside, little girls are apparently at risk of becoming ill later in life – because they are treated ‘like princesses’ at home.

Helen Fraser, chief executive of the Girls’ Day School Trust, has warned that girls are less active than boys by the age of eight, and only 12 per cent of 14-year-old girls are as physically active as they should be.

‘It may be cultural’, she said, adding: ‘Boys are encouraged into rough and tumble play whereas girls are often expected to be quiet and well-behaved like little princesses.

‘Actually we need to encourage them to get up and run around. It’s really important that girls take vigorous activity.’

Mrs Fraser, who oversees the education of 20,000 girls in England and Wales, went on to say that girls could be storing up future health problems such as type two diabetes and osteoporosis because they are failing to get into the habit of being regularly active as children.

In a speech this week, she will point out that many influential women in politics and business enjoyed sporting success in their youth, such as the US politician Condoleezza Rice, who was a tennis player and figure skater.

But Mrs Fraser, whose trust runs 24 independent schools and two state academies, will also insist that girls should not only be offered traditional competitive sports such as hockey and netball.

Activities such as Zumba, trampolining and tai chi can encourage a lifelong enjoyment of physical exercise among reluctant schoolgirls, she will say.

Speaking to the Mail ahead of the trust’s annual conference in London on Wednesday, which will discuss the role of sport in education, Mrs Fraser cited findings from the Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation that girls are starting to be less active than boys by the age of eight or nine.

Exercise can help protect against osteoporosis - by building bone strength - as well conditions such as type two diabetes and mental health problems such as anxiety and depression, she said.

Physical activity can also speed up blood flow to the brain, boosting brainpower.

‘Adolescence is quite a challenging period for boys and girls at every kind of school,’ she said.

‘We believe that sport really helps children get through that in great shape.’  She added: ‘Our approach is very much about there being a sport for everyone.’

Schools in the group offered a wide range of sports from traditional team games to Zumba and tai chi and mini-gyms for sixth-formers.

‘One of the things we want to do is ensure there’s a “sport for all” approach,’ she said.

‘Trampolining is fantastically popular. It’s really hard to be bad at trampolining.’

She said only around 20 per cent of girls would be good enough to compete seriously for their school, for example at county or national level.

‘We want to ensure the other 80 per cent have maximum opportunities to do different sports,’ she said.

‘There’s a sport for every girl – it may be netball, it may be Zumba.  If you build those habits of physical activity in childhood and adolescence, you are so much more likely to carry it on.

‘Men are much more likely than women to play sport at the age of 30 and that’s such a pity. We are hoping to build a lifelong habit of exercise and keeping fit.’

In her speech to the conference, Mrs Fraser will also highlight the role of sport in developing leadership skills.

She will cite a US survey of female business executives which found that 80 per cent played organised sport when they were growing up and credited it with giving them a competitive edge in the workplace.

Many successful women have a strong sporting track record, she will say, including the president of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, who played volleyball and Christine Lagarde, the first female head of the International Monetary Fund, who was a member of the French national synchronised swimming team.

Meanwhile Sports Minister Helen Grant represented her county at hockey, tennis, athletics and cross country.

‘There is quite a lot of evidence that sport builds leadership qualities,’ she said.

‘We are extremely keen on building confidence and girls’ ability to lead and sport has a huge amount to do with that.’

The GDST conference was also be addressed by Jennie Price, chief executive of Sport England.
