Latin lover: Miriam Clegg said she knew the deputy PM had fallen for her when he tried to dance

With her raven hair and big brown eyes, it’s easy to see how Miriam Gonzalez dazzled the young Nick Clegg.

But the Deputy Prime Minister had to put in plenty of fancy footwork to win her heart… quite literally.

Spanish-born Mrs Clegg has revealed how she fell in love with her future husband when he turned out to one of her Flamenco-style dancing classes while they were studying in Bruges more than 20 years ago.

Their romance was confirmed when Mr Clegg sat down with Miriam to watch Spanish films that helped ease her homesickness.

The pair married in Miriam’s home town
of Olmedo in September 2000 and have three children.

In a revealing 
interview with the Spanish magazine Telva, the 44-year-old international
lawyer confessed of the time they started dating: ‘When we Spanish used
to go abroad back then, the other students would always ask us to make 
Spanish omelette or teach Sevillana dancing.

‘That’s what I did, even though I’m 
from Valladolid and Nick signed up to my classes. When I saw him there, 
trying his hand, I took it as a declaration of love.

Romance: The Cleggs, pictured at the Diamond Jubilee, were married in 2000 and have three children

‘To put the icing on the cake, the 
first films that Nick saw in Brussels in Spanish was Wait for Me in 
Heaven and Welcome Mr Marshall.’

Politician’s daughter Mrs Clegg opened 
up on her marriage in an eight-page spread, which referred to her as 
‘Britain’s Third Lady’ after the Queen and Samantha Cameron.

She was also described as Miriam 
Gonzalez de Clegg, suggesting she is still caught between using her 
maiden name and the family name she agreed to use if her three sons were
given Spanish names.

She likened her romance with the Liberal Democrat leader to ‘taking a train that passes beside you in life’.

She also revealed the role models in 
their family home were Barcelona FC star Lionel Messi and outgoing 
manager Pep Guardiola and claimed: ‘We play football a lot. I know the 
full line-up of Arsenal and Barcelona.’

Asked about her favourite places
in London, she named bookstore Foyles, Richmond Park, the National 
Portrait Gallery and an award-winning restaurant specialising in Moorish
cuisine called Moro.

Mr Clegg, 45, has been undone himself 
by talking publicly about his private life. He once told GQ magazine he 
had ‘slept with no more than 30’ women, earning himself the nickname 
‘Cleggover’.

Wait For Me in Heaven is a 1987 
Spanish comedy about a shopkeeper kidnapped by secret police and groomed
to be late dictator General Franco’s stand-in. Welcome Mr Marshall is a
1953 comedy considered to be one of the masterpieces of Spanish cinema.
