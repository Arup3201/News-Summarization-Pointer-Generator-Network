Distressing allegations by Radio 1 DJ Liz Kershaw that her breasts were regularly groped live on air by a colleague were today dismissed by a fellow broadcaster as a 'practical joke', 'mucking around' and schoolboy 'joshing'.

Breakfast presenter in the 1980s, Mike Smith, has accused Ms Kershaw of smearing 'an awful lot of innocent, hard-working people' at the BBC, which he called a 'heinous crime'.

It came as more than 100 people are now believed to have been sexually assaulted by former Radio 1 and Top of the Pops presenter Jimmy Savile, and yesterday the corporation's Director General George Entwistle apologised to victims and promised a full inquiry into the scandal.

'I don't know which of the schoolboys
stuck his hands where they shouldn't be. And, frankly, I don't know why
Liz can't name him. But if this "trick" happened, it was a specific 
case,' he wrote on his website.

Later on 5Live he said: 'I think she’s guilty of generalising from the particular, which is a heinous crime.

Mr Smith said that Savile was a 'strange guy' but added the atmosphere at Radio 1 - where many attacks are alleged to have taken place - was 'more camp than predatory'.

Today it was also claimed that Savile molested five girls in the days before he died - while he waited to do a voiceover at a Leeds radio station.

One woman in her 20s told the Daily Star: 'Here was someone I looked up to. He was a national treasure and he had just grabbed my breasts.'

Discussion: Liz Kershaw will meet the Director General tomorrow to recount her experiences of being regularly groped by a fellow presenter - but Mike Smith says she is smearing innocent staff

Abuse: Rumours about Jimmy Savile's inappropriate behaviour were an 'open secret', according to Liz Kershaw

'There’s a danger here that an awful lot of innocent, good people are going to be smeared by the comments of Liz Kershaw.

'This witch hunt has got to stop.

'I’ve opened myself up now to the feminists attacking me – is it a crime?

'If Liz was genuinely threatened by this and couldn’t deal with it, yes that was a crime and that should be dealt with.'

When asked why it wouldn't be a crime he said: 'When you’ve got consenting people mucking about, you know, that’s when it’s not a crime.

'If that happened it’s absolutely appalling and I’m not supporting it in any way. Those sorts of practical joke.

Stars: Mr Smith, with his wife Sarah Greene, said the atmosphere at Radio 1 was 'more camp than predatory'

'I’m not saying this is a good thing, what I’m saying is that there was a lot of joshing around that went on and quite often you would have male DJs trying to put off other male DJs.'

Mr Smith, who joined Radio 1 in 1982 married fellow star Sarah Greene in 1989, said anyone who was attacked at the BBC must 'name names', adding that Savile was seen as an 'untouchable' 'god'

'The problem is you haven't got enough pages to debate this; it has been blown out of all proportion,' he went on.

David Cameron raised the prospect today of Sir Jimmy Savile being posthumously stripped of his knighthood in the wake of allegations of sexual abuse against young girls.

The Prime Minister stopped short of revealing whether he felt the former DJ should lose the honour, but suggested that the case should be considered by a Whitehall committee which has the power to recommend forfeiture.

His comments came after the chairman of the BBC Trust gave his backing to inquiries by police and the corporation.

Lord Patten said the allegations against Savile could not be excused as behaviour from a time when 'attitudes were different'.

The radio and TV presenter and charity fundraiser, who died in 2011, has been accused by a growing number of women in the last few weeks of sexual abuse over a number of years.

Mr Cameron told ITV1’s Daybreak programme today: 'These stories are deeply, deeply troubling and I hope that every organisation that has responsibilities will have a proper investigation into what happened, and if these things did happen, and how they were allowed to happen, and then of course everyone has to take their responsibilities.'

Asked if Savile should lose his knighthood, Mr Cameron said: 'We have something called a Forfeiture Committee. It is not chaired or sat on by me but it is responsible for looking at honours and the removal of honours, and obviously they have to do their job too.'

'And of course we're missing, as ever, the real nub of this story, and that is tracking down the poor people affected by Jimmy Savile.

'It has been blown into something else by other people. It's going to get confused and lost in the mists of time if we don't watch it.'

Liz Kershaw said this week she was looking forward to telling BBC boss George Entwistle ‘everything that I know’ after revealing how the male colleague had repeatedly ‘fondled her breasts’ on air in the late 1980s.

She declined to identify the groper, described as a former household name, but said she would also name other male contemporaries who had sex with Radio 1 and Top of the Pops fans.

Miss Kershaw, 54, who now presents a  programme on BBC Six Music, said she was ‘intimidated’ by the atmosphere at Radio 1 when she joined 25 years ago.

She said: ‘I would be sitting in the studio with my headphones on, my back to the studio door, live on air. I couldn’t hear a thing except what was playing in my headphones. Then I’d find these wandering hands up my jumper, fondling my breasts.

‘And I couldn’t say anything. I couldn’t even exclaim because I was broadcasting to the nation. And when I complained to somebody, they were incredulous, and said “What? Don’t you like it? Are you a lesbian?”

‘The culture at Radio 1 then was something I had never encountered before. I’ve always said it was like walking into a rugby club locker room.’

She said rumours about Jimmy Savile’s behaviour were an ‘open secret’ when she joined Radio 1, mainly about his adventures on the Radio 1 roadshow.

She said: ‘It was massive then. It was rather like the X Factor going around the country. Can you imagine the X Factor judges rounding up the contestants and asking for sexual favours after the show? I don’t think so.’ Miss Kershaw joined Radio 1 shortly after Savile’s departure, but said colleagues constantly joked about his behaviour.

She said: ‘With all the piety about him when he died last year I was rather sickened, and I thought “why don’t people say what he was really like?”

DJ Dave Lee Travis, nicknamed The Hairy Monster, is another star from the 1980s facing accusations.

In an article written after interviewing Travis in June, Sunday Times reporter Camilla Long, described how ‘over 90 minutes I don’t think there was a part of my body he did not grope’.
