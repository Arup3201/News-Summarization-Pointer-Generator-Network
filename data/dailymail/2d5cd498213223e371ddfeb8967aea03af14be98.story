The age-old assumption: 'It's the thought that counts' isn't strictly true this Christmas.

According to a new survey women want their lover to spend half a week’s salary on their Christmas present.

In fact, women love to be spoilt and have a figure in their mind which they expect their partner to spend.

Spoilt rotten: Women have an idea in their mind of how much they want their partner to spend, and it is very steep

Men also have a  figure – but it is far lower than a woman’s at a third of a week’s wages.

The average salary for men in Britain is £30,852 a year – which means women whose partners earn that sum expect a present of the value of £296.50.

The average salary for women is more than £6,000 less than men at £24,228.

Men with partners earning that average figure would expect a present valued at £155.

Obviously as income increases, so does the expectation on spending – so a woman whose partner earned around £100,000 would expect a present costing around £1,000.

Dexter Koh, 30, said he would spent around £2,000 on his girlfriend's Christmas present.

Koh, a London-based entrepreneur, said: 'That phrase, "It's the thought that counts" is such nonsense.

Great expectations: Women want men to spend half of their weekly salary on their Christmas gift this year

'It's the noughts that count - how much have you spend on the present.

'A nice pair Christian Louboutins will
get you a lot more Brownie points that a few pictures you have stuck 
together in an album.'

Koh, who is dating a 21-year-old 
Oxford University student he met on sugar daddy sating site Seekingarrangement.com, plans to whisk his new 
lover away on a Christmas break.

He smiled: 'I can't say where we are going because it is a surprise but no expense will be spared.'

Traditionally men are expected to spend two month’s money on an engagement ring.

The figure for a Christmas present was
always expected to be lower – but what was surprising was how important
expenditure was to women.

SeekingArrangement founder Brandon Wade said: 'What this shows is that girls love to be treated like princess and spoilt.

'It might be a cliché but the sexiest thing about a man to many women is his wallet.

'Women want to be pampered and they expect men to spend far more on them than they do on their men.'

The average salary of a male 
SeekingArrangement member is £170,000 – which means his girlfriend would
expect a present costing around £2,000.

And it'd North East shoppers who are set to spend 
the most, with a very un-Scrooge like average of £485 compared to the 
more festively frugal East Anglia shopper average of £310.

The
study of UK shopping habits, commissioned by Golden Square Shopping 
Centre, in Warrington, shows that one in four men leave the present 
buying to just one day, 20 per cent spend over £100 than expected and during 
their shopping splurges a staggering 1.3 million men are set to blow 
their budget due to self-gifting.
