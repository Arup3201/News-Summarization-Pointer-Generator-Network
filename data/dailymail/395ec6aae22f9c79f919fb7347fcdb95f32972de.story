A teenager is behind bars after being charged with murdering his brother.

Charged: keandre Washington (above) allegedly beat his brother to death with a hammer

Keandre Washington of Northwoods, Missouri, allegedly beat his brother Bobby to death with a hammer early Tuesday morning.

This all happened as their mother ran from the house in search of help.

According to KSDK, officers responded to a call of a domestic disturbance and found Bobby, 25, dead on the floor of the home, having suffered numerous blows to the head from a hammer.

The boys' mother said she had been 'scared' of what was happening when she left the house.

Both boys, and their mother, lived at the home together. 

Now Keandre, 17, has been charged with second-degree murder and armed criminal action, and is being held on $200,000 bail.

Authorities are still not certain what the boys were fighting about, and an investigation is ongoing. 

As of Tuesday there have now been 148 murders in the St. Louis area this year, a staggering number.

St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay is now considering a special gun court in hopes that the city can get that number lower moving forward.

'We should have no tolerance for violence in the city, we have way too many guns,' Slay said. 

As for hammers, this is the second recent death in the city as the result of the hardware tool. 

A group of teens has been charged with beating a man to death with hammers just last week.

Some report that the teens had targeted the man, Zemir Begic, because he was a Bosnian immigrant.
