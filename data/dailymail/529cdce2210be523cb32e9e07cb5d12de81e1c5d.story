Walking miracle Darek Fidyka was paralysed from the waist down in a frenzied knife attack by a love rival, he revealed yesterday.

The fireman was set upon in the street by his then girlfriend’s jealous ex-husband after trying to stop him vandalising his car.

Mr Fidyka, 40, was paralysed in the attack, but is now able to walk again thanks to a pioneering British treatment. Yesterday, he told the Mail: ‘He stabbed me 18 times. It was a planned, surprise attack with a knife.’

But Mr Fidyka has been able to walk again after receiving pioneering treatment which has repaired his severed spine. He is believed to be the first person in the world to recover from such chronic injuries

The 40-year-old fireman was left with no movement or feeling from the waist down

Asked whether his attacker served a jail term, divorced father-of-one Mr Fidyka claimed: ‘No, he didn’t. He thought I’d kill him because of what he did to me. So that night he killed himself.’

The terrifying incident in July 2010 left Mr Fidyka with no movement or feeling from the waist down, and facing the rest of his life in a wheelchair after one of the wounds severed his spinal cord.

But he made world headlines this week when it was announced that he has learned to walk again two years after undergoing revolutionary treatment in a British-led breakthrough.

His amazing recovery has allowed him to revive his hobby of hunting and also to drive an adapted car. ‘Physically, I feel great,’ he said. ‘I’m able to walk again — and that was a very nice surprise.’

Before the attack, Bulgarian-born Mr Fidyka was a painter and decorator in Poland as well as a volunteer fireman. He described the recovery as ‘being reborn’.

‘When it starts coming back you feel as if you have started your life all over again,’ he said in an interview for the Panorama special To Walk Again, shown on BBC1 last night.

In the breakthrough procedure, cells from his nose were transplanted into the damaged part of his spine to repair his spinal cord. After months of physiotherapy, he sensed feeling in his legs.

The treatment, funded by the Nicholls Spinal Injury Foundation and UK Stem Cell Foundation, brings hope for millions of paralysed people. It was carried out by neurosurgeons in Wroclaw, Poland. Yesterday, Professor Geoffrey Raisman, whose team at University College London discovered the technique, said Mr Fidyka’s wound presented the ‘ideal situation’ to test it on a human.

Dr Dusko Ilic, senior lecturer in stem cell science at King’s College London, counselled caution: ‘It is known from animal studies that some transplantations of olfactory ensheathing glial (OEG) cells led to marked improvements; in other cases not. We need to enrol more people in the study to get a better idea of how reliable this approach is.’ 

The Brits behind the triumph: Maverick surgeon 'experts' sneered at

It’s too soon to say what the history books will make of Geoffrey Raisman. If he really has discovered a cure for spinal injuries, the professor may one day rank among the greats of medical science alongside the heart transplant pioneer Christiaan Barnard or IVF researcher Sir Robert Edwards.

For now, following his pioneering surgery on the paralysed Bulgarian fireman Darek Fidyka, he is a beacon of hope for hundreds of thousands of people around the world unable to walk because of spinal cord injury.

Professor Geoffrey Raisman, from the University College London, discovered the pioneering surgery Mr Fidyka received

Like many of the great medical pioneers, Raisman is a maverick. A fiercely anti-establishment figure — he once named Tony Benn as his favourite politician — he came from a poor, working-class background and worked his way to the very top of his profession.

Colleagues describe him as an obsessive, meticulous researcher who has devoted his life to one cause — exploring how neurons, the cells in our brains and central nervous system, can regenerate.

Born in 1939, Raisman was the only son of a Leeds tailor. Raisman’s father encouraged his son’s interest in science and later persuaded him to study medicine. Raisman excelled at grammar school and aged 17 he won a scholarship to Oxford University — his father made his interview suit.

His rebellious, stubborn streak was apparent even then. At a time when Oxford expected students to be single, Raisman risked his college place by marrying his sweetheart Vivien aged 18. She gave up her place at Edinburgh University and lived with him in one room in Oxford. Raisman lost his scholarship but clung on to his place at the college. He qualified as a doctor and stayed on at Oxford as a research neuroscientist.

Then in his 20s he made an extraordinary discovery. Using an electron microscope that magnified cells up to one million times, he found that the brain and central nervous system have an amazing ability to rewire themselves after injury. If the brain is damaged, new connections spring up around the damaged area. The process — which Raisman named plasticity — was scientific heresy. At the time, the established thinking was that once a brain was injured, or a spinal cord severed, the damage was irreparable.

He turned out to be right. Today, it appears in every textbook about the brain.

In the Seventies, when Raisman suggested that brain damage could be reversed, he was accused of pushing ‘dangerous’ ideas that would create false hopes. But he was determined to show the world that brain and spinal cord damage could be repaired.

In the Eighties, he had a second breakthrough when he discovered that the neurons involved in taste and smell have the unique ability to regenerate after they have been badly damaged. In the Nineties, he transplanted these cells into the severed spinal cords of laboratory animals. They did their job and repaired the damage.

He repeated the experiment dozens of times before moving on to people. His pioneering work culminated with the extraordinary success this week.

Other neuroscientists yesterday tried to play down the ‘breakthrough’. But as we have seen, scientists underestimate Prof Raisman at their peril.

The father who never gave up hope 

When Daniel Nicholls plunged into the ocean off Sydney’s Bondi Beach, life could hardly have been better. The 18-year-old — celebrating the end of his A-Levels in 2003 with a holiday to Australia — had his whole life ahead of him.

But, as he dived into a wave, his head hit a hidden sandbank, severing his spinal cord and breaking his neck. He was left unable to walk, with no feeling in his legs, and little movement in his arms.

Sixty per cent of spinal injuries are ‘incomplete’ — meaning that the spinal cord isn’t completely severed and that there’s a remnant of feeling or movement in the limbs, which can be built on.

But Daniel’s accident was among the other 40 per cent of spinal injuries, when the spinal cord is completely severed — these are injuries that you supposedly have no chance of recovering from.

Yet, out of this terrible tragedy, an extraordinary silver lining has emerged. Thanks to the exceptional dedication of Daniel’s father, a historic breakthrough has been made in the field of spinal surgery.

David Nicholls, a British former chef and hotelier, was told by doctors that Daniel had no chance of any recovery. But he refused to take no for an answer. He assured his son that he would find a cure.

Through a decade-long whirl of fund-raising — helped by celebrity friends in the culinary world — Mr Nicholls raised £1 million to provide basic medical research into a cure for spinal injuries such as his son’s.

Now, using those funds, surgeons in Wroclaw, Poland, have treated Mr Fidyka, left paralysed from the waist down after being stabbed four years ago.

Like Daniel Nicholls, he’d had his spinal nerves completely severed, and, despite six months of physiotherapy, there had been no improvement. His revolutionary treatment — performed for the first time — saw cells from his nasal cavity transplanted to the affected part of his spine.

Today, two years after his operation, not only can he walk with a frame, he can also drive, and even go hunting with his old friends.

Mr Nicholls, still determined to make good on his promise, now hopes that his ‘son will be near the front of the queue’ for the treatment.

‘It was the most devastating thing in my life, seeing a fit, healthy, lean, good-looking 18-year-old boy in bed unable to move,’ he said. Galvanised by the tragedy, he set up the Nicholls Spinal Injury Foundation to raise funds for medical research.

After the latest triumph, and with more money needed to continue the medical trials, Mr Nicholls has vowed to keep fund-raising at a furious pace. He has a promise to keep.
