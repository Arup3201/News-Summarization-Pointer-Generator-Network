Sex crazed: Dr. Arthur Zilberstein's 'preoccupation with sexual matters' caused him to lose his license

A doctor has had his license suspended after bizarre, sexually-fueled behavior at work, says the state Department of Heath.

Dr. Arthur Zilberstein's 'preoccupation with sexual matters' including using medical images for sexual gratification and having sexual encounters at his workplace led to his license being suspended by the Medical Commission on June 5, 2014.

Seattle Pi reports that a subsequent hearing reviewing the charges led to the indefinite suspension.

Zilberstein must undergo a mental and behavioral evaluation and pay a $5,000 fine.

He will be able to peitition for the reinstatement of his medical license only after he completes the mandated evaluation and recommendations.

The anesthesiologist, from Seattle, Washington, also allegedly sent explicit texts while performing C-sections and naked selfies to a patient at Swedish Medical Center where he worked.

The charges said some of the pictures were 'depicting himself in hospital scrubs, wearing his hospital badge and exposing his genitals'.

Washington state health authorities said 47-year-old Zilberstein repeatedly compromised patient safety between at least April 2013 and August 2013.

Authorities accused Zilberstein, who has been in practice since 1995, of issuing at least 29 unauthorized prescriptions for controlled substances and other drugs.

The charges, filed with the state Medical Quality Assurance Commission, also allege that Zilberstein prescribed unauthorized narcotics to a female patient he had sex with, NBC News reported.

On one day alone, June 17, 2013, he is accused of sending 64 texts, many just minutes apart, during seven surgeries, many of which had sexual innuendos.

One read: 'I'm hella busy with C sections.'

Another read: 'Oh. And my partner walked in as I was pulling up my scrubs. I'm pretty sure he caught me.'

The charges state: 'Respondent's lack of focus on patient care while providing anesthesia services for hospital-based surgical procedures routinely fell below the standard of care and put patients at unreasonable risk of harm.'

Zilberstein also demonstrated 'moral turpitude' that reflected badly on the medical profession. 

He was contracted through Physicians Anesthesia Services with Swedish Medical Center to provide care , NBC News reported.

Hospital spokesman Clay Holtzman said: 'The safety of our patients is our number one priority. Once we learned that the state had suspended this physician's medical license, the physician's medical staff membership and privileges were immediately suspended.

'We just recently learned of these allegations and are conducting our own internal review of the physician, who is not directly employed by Swedish.'
