He may be one of America’s political elite, but US Ambassador Matthew Barzun has shown an astute grip of how best to connect with ordinary folk – by taking the London Underground.

While former ambassadors travelled by chauffeured limousine with darkened windows, Mr Barzun opted to travel by Tube to the O2 Arena last Friday night to watch veteran rock group The Eagles.

It is a fitting mode of transport for the new  ‘dress-down’ ambassador. Mr Barzun, 43, is the youngest-ever American envoy to the UK and has a ‘down with the kids’ attitude.

Take it easy: Heading out on the Underground, dressed in his most casual smart clothes. . .

Since he arrived with his wife Brooke and three young children to take up the post in August last year, he has beguiled visitors by dressing in denim and hosting parties at his official ten-bedroom residence, Grade II listed Winfield House, in the capital with a beer can in his hand rather than a champagne flute.

He even dishes out Ferrero Rocher chocolates.

It’s not the first time he has travelled by Tube: days earlier he tweeted a picture he took inside a carriage when travelling to meet US Secretary of State John  Kerry and British Foreign Secretary William Hague.
