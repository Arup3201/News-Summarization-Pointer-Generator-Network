Gina DeJesus, one of the three women who was snatched from the streets and held captive in a Cleveland house for a decade, has made her first public appearance since her dramatic escape.

The 23-year-old looked relaxed as she waved a flag and threw treats to the crowd during the annual Puerto Rican Parade and Latino Fest on Sunday.

Although Gina thanked her supporters in a video released by the three survivors a month ago, it is the first time she has been seen in public since just her escape from the house on May 6.

Her smiling, relaxed appearance came in stark contrast with the gaunt, shaky figure that appeared in police interview footage shortly after her escape three months ago.

Free: Gina DeJesus laughed and waved as she took part in a parade on Sunday - in her first public appearance since she escaped the house of horrors where she was held captive for a decade

Support: Gina, right, took part in the Puerto Rican Parade and Latino Fest for a city council candidate

The other survivors, Amanda Berry and Michelle Knight, have also stepped out in public in remarkable shows of courage.

Berry, 27, was pictured dancing at a Nelly concert last
month, while 32-year-old Knight faced her captor, Ariel 
Castro, at his sentencing in court last week before returning to the 
home on Seymour Avenue on Friday to thank neighbors for their support.

Members of the community who attended the parade on Sunday said they became emotional when they saw DeJesus, whose family is Puerto Rican. She was riding with relatives as part of the Janet Garcia for City Council group.

'It was very beautiful. I got chills when I saw her on top of the car,' Vivian Prez, who watched the parade, told Fox8.

Happy to be there: Gina seemed at ease as she rode atop the car and waved to the crowds

Joy: DeJesus gave a 'thumbs-up' - an echo of the sign she gave as she arrived home after her escape

Parade: She took part in the annual parade where local groups raised awareness of missing people

Aida Cruz added: 'I got emotional when
I saw her. I got a granddaughter back there, looked like she was about 
to cry. It was just very emotional.'

The
theme of the parade was 'a celebration of renewed hope and community 
healing', and many taking part in the festival held posters bearing the 
faces of people missing from the area.

DeJesus' father Felix also spoke at the Latino Fest with his wife by his side as he pleaded with the crowd to keep their ears and eyes open to help find other missing children in the state.

'I want to tell you Gina, Amanda and Michelle are doing beautiful,' he said. 'I got to tell you something. Our work is not done. We have more beautiful children out there that need our help.'

Community activist Angel Arroyo added:
'On Friday, there were still 95 people in this city missing. Fifty 
people from the list are children, 45 people are adults and so we still 
have a lot right here.'

The three survivors released a video last month thanking people for their support and donations.

After
their escape from Ariel Castro's house, The Cleveland Courage Fund was 
set up to help them rebuild their lives and has so far raised more than 
$1.2 million.

'I would like to say thank you for the
support,' DeJesus said in the video, while the other two women spoke 
out at greater length.

The
three women and a six-year-old girl fathered by Castro were saved from 
the house in Cleveland in May after Amanda Berry managed to escape, 
alert neighbors and call 911.

Appearance: Michelle Knight, pictured right, stepped out in public on Friday to thank neighbors near the home she had been held captive for a decade with the other girls

They had been kidnapped between 2002 and 2004 and held captive at the home for more than a decade, where they were subjected to sexual, physical and emotional violence.

Castro pleaded guilty to more than 900 counts and last week and he was sentenced to life in prison plus 1,000 years for the sick crimes.

He has started his prison term in isolation due to the high profile of the case.

Graphic and disturbing evidence was heard during the four-and-a-half-hour hearing on Thursday, with Castro himself giving a deluded version of events in which he denied raping his victims.

Standing in an orange jumpsuit, Castro
shocked the packed courtroom by stating there was 'a lot of harmony' in
the house where he trapped and abused the three women.

The detective in charge of the case described how Castro abducted the three women, took them to his home and immediately tied them in chains in the basement and raped them.

He put a motorbike helmet on each girl and left them in the dark basement overnight, Detective Harasimchuk said.

'Each woman told me they were repeatedly sexually, physically and emotionally abused by Ariel Castro during the entire time they were in captivity,' he said.

The women disappeared separately between 2002 and 2004, when they were 14, 16 and 20 years.

But at the hearing on Thursday, 
Michelle Knight bravely faced him and said: 'You took 11 years of my 
life away, but now I have it back. I spent 11 years in hell. Now your 
hell is just beginning.'
