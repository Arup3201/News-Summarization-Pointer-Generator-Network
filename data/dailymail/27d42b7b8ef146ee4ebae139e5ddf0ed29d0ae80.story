Chimpanzees have special 'words' that they use for different types of food and can even learn the calls used by strangers from foreign groups.

Primatologists have found that a group of adult chimpanzees from a safari park in Holland adapted the grunts they produced for foods like apples to match those of other chimps they lived with in Edinburgh.

Their findings are the first evidence that chimpanzees can learn calls referring to specific foods or objects.

Previously scientists had believed such calls in response to food and alarm calls were an expression of their excitement and cannot be controlled.

Chimpanzees bash out distinctive drum solos on the roots of trees as a form of 'signature' and to tell others in their group where they are.

Biologists studying the primates have found over the years that male chimps grip the buttresses of tree roots with their hands and beat them with their feet.

The noises produced - which is normally accompanied with loud hooting -  are known as pant calls, and can be heard more than half a mile (1km) away, even in the dense jungle.

But now one group of scientists studying the animal in the Sonso Community in the Budongo Forest in Uganda, have found that this drumming contains distinctive rhythmic patterns that can be used to identify a specific individual.

Each male used a different number of beats and used a style of doublets and pauses that was distinct to them.

The researchers also discovered that the chimps tended to use drumming far more often when their group was travelling. They believe this may help keeps tabs on an individual's whereabouts. 

Many scientists have assumed that one of the defining features of human language is that objects and events can be named with different words or symbols depending on the culture.

Now research by scientists at the University of York and the University of Zurich is challenging this assumption.

Dr Katie Slocombe, a psychologist at the University of York who led the study, said it could have new implications for the evolution of language in humans.

She said: 'An extraordinary feature of human language is our ability to reference external objects and events with socially learned symbols, or words.

'This represents the first evidence of non-human animals actively modifying and socially learning the structure of a meaningful referential vocalisation.

'The socially learnt nature of referential words in humans is likely to have ancient evolutionary origins.'

The researchers, whose findings are published in the journal of Current Biology, watched a group of adult chimpanzees from Beekse Bergen Safari Park in the Netherlands were moved to join a group of chimpanzees in Edinburgh Zoo.

By analysing the acoustic structures of the calls they produced for apples, they found that the two groups of animals had different calls for the fruit before they were put together in 2010.

While the Dutch chimps used high pitched grunts the Edinburgh chimps used far lower and softer sounds. 

After a year of integration, the grunt calls for apple were still different, but after three years the calls produced by the Dutch chimpanzees had changed to match those produced by those from Edinburgh.

The researchers found that by this time the chimpanzees had formed strong friendships and the groups had joined together into one.

Dr Simon Townsend, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Zurich who also took part in the study, said: 'Three years after the integration, the grunt calls of the new chimpanzees very much resembled the grunt calls produced by the Edinburgh chimpanzees.

'The preferences for apple in these chimpanzees stayed the same during this period, but the grunt calls changed.'

He added: 'The fact that both humans and now chimpanzees possess this basic ability suggests that our shared common ancestor living over 6 million years ago may also have been socially learning referential vocalisations.'

The findings are the first evidence that chimps like the one above can learn new calls for foods and objects

Scientists studying the Sonso chimpanzee community living in Uganda's Budongo Forest have been able to witness how the animals teach each other to use tools.

The analysis began when one chimp called Nick, the 29-year-old alpha male chimpanzee, made a moss sponge while being watched by Nambi, a dominant adult female.

Over the next six days a further seven individuals made and used moss sponges.

Six of these had observed the behaviour before adopting it and the seventh was seen to re-use a discarded moss sponge so may have learned about the novel behaviour in this way.

The scientists also recorded a 12-year-old sub-adult male retrieve and use a discarded leaf sponge.

A further eight individuals adopted the re-use technique, but only four of them observed another individual re-using a sponge first.

By using a technique called network-based diffusion analysis the researchers estimated that each time a 'naïve' chimpanzee observed moss-sponging, this individual was 15 times more likely to develop the behaviour.

This striking effect contrasted with the re-use behaviour in which social learning played much less of a role.

Such behaviour was thought to be a defining feature of human language

It suggests this feature of langauge evolved far longer ago than believed
