A couple has been stoned to death for adultery in a remote southwest region of Pakistan on the orders of an Islamic cleric.

Daraz Khan, 25, and Hayat Bibi, 27, were killed by a mob led by Mrs Bibi’s husband in the Loralai district in Balochistan.

Ms Bibi went into hiding a week ago when the alleged affair was discovered, but then came forward when she heard that the mob had captured Mr Khan, locals reported.

A couple was stoned to death in Pakistan after they allegedly had an affair. Stoning is legal in the country with permission of the courts, though in this instance the stoning occurred illegally

She was forced to watch the mob stone Mr Khan to death before they turned on her.

The mob, led by her husband and brothers, then threw rocks and bricks at her until she died.

Ms Bibi’s husband had approached a local cleric demanding the couple should be stoned to death in compliance with Shariah law, reported The Times.

Stoning is legal in Pakistan, but only if the sentence is passed by a federal or provincial court, which did not happen in this case where the death was sanctioned only by tribal elders.

No one has ever legally been stoned to death in Pakistan.

Ms Bibi’s husband, the cleric, and four others have been arrested and the bodies of the couple are being exhumed today to prove they were stoned to death.

‘It is a shameful act and the people involved in stoning the man and the woman will be brought to justice,’ said Sarfaraz Bugti, the home minister for Baluchistan.

In Pakistan, a conviction for murder can carry the death sentence, but despite Mr Bugti’s outrage, it is widely expected that no action will be taken against the six men

Police rarely intervene in cases such as this one and the federal courts have little authority in remote regions of the country, including Balochistan, meaning that it is often left to local tribal and religious leaders to mete out punishments, which are usually harsher than the law allows.

Even if cases of so-called ‘honour killings’ are brought to court, they often take years to be heard. The national conviction rate is between 5 and 10 percent.

If someone is convicted, the victim's family can forgive the killers, which is a major loophole considering the killers are often members of the victim’s family.

Two other couples accused of adultery have been killed in Loralai district in the last two months. ‘Honour killings’ for adultery are not uncommon in Pakistan, but stonings are rare.

Last year a young mother of two, Afridi Bibi, no relation to Hayat Bibi, was stoned to death by a mob led by her uncle for carrying a mobile phone in Punjab province of Pakistan.

The death sparked fears that stoning might be on the rise in certain countries, including Pakistan and Afghanistan.

The practice of stoning is legal in 15 Muslim countries and is set out as a specific punishment for adultery under several interpretations of Sharia law.

Its supporters say stoning is legitimised by the Hadith – the deeds and saying of the Prophet Muhammad – though there is no mention of the practice in the Koran.
