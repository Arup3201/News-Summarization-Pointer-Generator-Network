Families should fix their mortgages to protect themselves against ‘a real risk of exposure to rising interest rates’, a senior member of the Bank of England said yesterday.

Mortgages have never been cheaper since the Bank cut the base rate to 0.5 per cent nearly five years ago, the lowest level in its 320-year history.

But the comments, from  Richard Sharp, will fuel families’ fears that rates are set to rise sooner rather than later.

They came ahead of a survey from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors saying house prices are rising at an ‘unsustainable’ rate and are a nightmare for people trying to get on to the property ladder or to climb up it.

It says the problem is fuelled by the toxic combination of rising numbers of people wanting to buy but a chronic lack of homes for sale.

While many parts of the country are not affected, the problem exists in London, many parts of the South East as well as various ‘micro markets’ – particular  villages or neighbourhoods – around the country.

Grilled by the Treasury select committee yesterday, Mr Sharp, who sits on the Bank’s financial policy committee, was asked about fixed-rate mortgages.

He said that, for ‘practical 
purposes’, interest rates in Britain are ‘close to zero’. Mr Sharp 
added: ‘So you have also got to make a judgment about the future. 
Certainly my judgment would be this would be a good time [to fix your 
mortgage].’

Mr Sharp, who worked at Goldman Sachs for 23 years, does not sit on the Bank’s interest rate setting committee.

His advice comes as the Council of 
Mortgage Lenders said yesterday nearly nine in ten families who are 
taking out a mortgage are choosing a fixed-rate loan, the highest number
 since records began.

Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has urged mortgage lenders and borrowers to accept that interest rates could be much higher than the current level in years to come

One
 expert said yesterday homeowners must accept that the Bank’s base rate 
is ‘only going to go up.’

At present, the financial markets expect the 
Bank of England’s base rate will be 3 per cent in five years’ time.

In November, 88 per cent of  people 
who took out a new mortgage or remortgaged their  existing deal opted 
for a fixed-rate loan, according to the CML.

A fixed-rate loan means they pay a fixed interest rate for a set period of time, such as a five-year deal charging a rate of 3 per cent.

The CML said fixed rate mortgages have a ‘strong attraction’, particularly as they are so much cheaper than other types of deals at the moment.

At the same  committee hearing, Mark Carney, the Bank’s governor, also urged mortgage lenders and borrowers to accept that interest rates could be much higher than the current level in years to come.

He said: ‘We need to ensure that lenders and households consider their ability to service their mortgages and retain their homes in more adverse, higher interest rate, scenarios.’

Mr Carney also said house prices are likely to continue rising robustly until the middle of next year as the recovery picks up pace.

He told MPs: ‘Our general expectation
 has been for a continuation of current momentum – house price momentum,
 mortgage activity, credit growth momentum – into 2014, before 
decelerating around the middle of 2015 towards 2016.’

Across the board: House prices are rising in all regions but there is a big gap in the pace of increase

Outpaced: House prices paid by first-time buyers are rising faster than the wider market and those paid by home movers, the ONS data shows.

But RICS warned of ‘a growing risk of another house price boom’ and said urgent action is needed by the Bank of England.

The latest official figures, from the Office for National Statistics, show house prices in London are rising at 11.6 per cent a year and 4.5 per cent in the South East.

The RICS report, published today, said demand is being fuelled by the cheapest mortgages in history, the Government’s Help to Buy scheme as well as the increased availability of loans for people with deposits of less than ten per cent.

Official figures reveal house prices are nearly 80 per cent higher in London than they are in the rest of the country.
