Derby manager Steve McClaren is still getting it right in the League Cup – 10 years after making his managerial name by winning the competition with Middlesbrough.

Every big decision McClaren made on Tuesday paid dividends as Derby cruised into the last 16 with second-half goals by Johnny Russell and a late Alex Pearce own goal.

The former England manager gave 22-year Dutchman Kelle Roos his debut in goal and the 'keeper made key saves from Jamie Mackie and Ryan Edwards when the game was goalless.

Then, he threw on last season's top scorer Chris Martin for the final quarter and the striker played an important part in both goals.

On top of that, Liverpool winger Jordan Ibe was in thrilling form as he continued his successful loan spell at the iPRO stadium.

'We made six changes but out football continued. It was a very good performance,' said McClaren.

'It was important to give Kelle a chance and see if he could handle it. And he did his job to keep us in the game.

'Jordan is a throwback to the days of jinky wingers. When he picks the ball up, fans get on the edge of their seat. I know I do.'

Derby dominated first-half possession and their best chance fell to Leon Best who forced a smart save from Mikkel Andersen.

But, with the interval approaching, Derby defender Cyrus Christie hit a dreadful backpass straight to Mackie and was relieved Kroos spread his 6ft 5in frame to keep the game goalless.

'It was a good opportunity and the first goal was always going to be important,' rued Reading boss Nigel Adkins.

Derby didn't let Reading off the hook. Ibe rattled the Reading crossbar via Andersen's fingertips and just after the hour McClaren sent on last season's top scorer Martin for teenager Will Hughes, who impressed on his 100th appearance for the club.

Within three minutes, Derby were ahead, with Martin inevitably involved in the move that allowed Russell to run through from midfield and fire low past Andersen. 'A terrific finish,' purred McClaren.

Derby tied up the win after 82 minutes when Martin's cross struck Pearce, who was facing his own goal and watched in horror as the ball crossed the line.
