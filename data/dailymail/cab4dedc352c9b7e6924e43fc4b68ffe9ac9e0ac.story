Up to 3,000 Britons have poured up to £250 million of their savings into a controversial Caribbean property scheme which is facing the threat of legal action.

Several investors say they fear financial calamity after being persuaded by pension advisers to put large sums into projects run by Essex-based  Harlequin Property. It has promised to build 6,000 luxury villas in St Lucia, St Vincent, Barbados and the Dominican Republic. So far only 300 have been constructed.

The Financial Services Authority (FSA) has issued an ‘alert’ about the company and the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has been asked to investigate.

The Mail on Sunday has discovered that:

Harlequin, however, points to its successful developments elsewhere and says its record-keeping is being improved.

What they bought: An artists impression of the luxury Merricks Resort in Barbados

What they've got: How the site of the planned Barbados holiday village which drew in millions of pounds in deposits looked last week

David Ames, 61, who runs the company 
with wife Carol, also 61, and son Daniel, 35, from a business park in 
Basildon, strongly denies misleading investors.

He says he has been 
duped by contractors which are now the subject of legal action and that 
all the projects will eventually be completed.

But
Gareth Fatchett, of Regulatory Legal Solicitors, which represents a 
group of Harlequin clients, said: ‘We have a serious concerns that the 
advice to invest for most investors is seriously flawed.

Many people 
have invested all their pensions in Harlequin products. We have sent our
lawyers to Barbados and St Vincent to check out the land, accounting 
and building progress. On all fronts we have concerns.’

Denial: David Ames who runs Harlequin Property denies misleading investors and says he was duped by contractors

In
October 2011, David Ames announced that work had begun on a ‘show 
village’ for a new development, the Merricks Beach Resort, in Barbados.

But a Mail on Sunday reporter who visited the site last week found a 
plywood sign for a ‘luxury  five-star resort’ mounted in a 
rubbish-strewn field.

A potholed farm track petered out at a partially 
finished guardhouse.

‘I don’t believe this resort will be finished in my lifetime,’ said Clyde Mason, who lives nearby.

Businessman
Paul Walton, who released £112,000 from his pension scheme for deposits
on two properties, said: ‘I just can’t see these properties being 
built. I feel badly let down by Harlequin because no one is prepared to 
give a straight answer.’

The FSA said: ‘We have seen an increasing
number of self-invested personal pension schemes whose underlying 
investment is in an overseas property purchased through Harlequin 
Property, a UK-based . . . sales agent that is not regulated by the FSA.

'The FSA expects advisers to have undertaken thorough due diligence on 
the various developments being sold through Harlequin.’

Arnhim Eustace, a former prime minister of St Vincent, told the Mail on Sunday he had seen a 40-page complaint to the SFO.

‘I have been sent a copy of the submission which I understand was sent to the SFO,’ he said.

‘It is a 40-page document filed on behalf of people who want to get back their money.’

He added that the project also has been plagued by claims that Harlequin built part of the resort on land that it did not own and by complaints that contractors and suppliers have not been fully paid.

‘Two building companies and seven individuals have contacted me to say they were owed money,’ he said.

‘I appealed to Harlequin to pay them but with no result. These are people like a pineapple farmer, owed as little as 1500 (St Vincent ) dollars) for pineapples. He says he was paid only 300.’

A spokesman for Cash said: ‘Harlequin is licensed for a period of time to use the name of the Pat Cash Tennis Academy.’

Liverpool FC did not respond to requests to comment, and a spokesman for Townsend was unavailable.
