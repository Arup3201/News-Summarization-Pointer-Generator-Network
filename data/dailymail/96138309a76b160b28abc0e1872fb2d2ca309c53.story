Former Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Frimpong has been released by Barnsley after less than four months at the Championship club.

The 22-year-old played nine games for the Tykes, who were recently relegated to League One after losing six of their last seven games.

Frimpong, who is among 14 released players, was sent off thirty minutes into his Barnsley debut and was booked four times in his following eight games.

Brazil bound? Frimpong has reportedly been included in Ghana's provisional World Cup squad

The injury-prone Ghanaian previously enjoyed loan spells at Wolves, Charlton and Fulham, but never progressed under Arsene Wenger.

He impressed in Arsenal's youth set up, alongside Jack Wilshere, but lacked the required quality to progress in the first team.

Despite his lack of playing time at Barnsley, Frimpong has been included in Ghana's provisional World Cup squad according to the Ghana News Agency.
