The world-famous Clifton Suspension Bridge should be a World Heritage site, it was claimed today.

George Ferguson, the newly-elected Mayor of Bristol, has set up a steering group to investigate applying for designation from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.

He believes Isambard Kingdom Brunel's Grade I-listed structure in Clifton, Bristol, should be given protected status along with the city’s Avon Gorge, SS Great Britain and historic harbour.

At night: The Clifton Suspension Bridge was originally meant for light horse drawn traffic but now withstands the demands of modern commuters - with up to 12,000 vehicles crossing it every day

Construction: Work began on the bridge in 1836 under the supervision of Isambard Kingdom Brunel but stopped due to lack of funds. Work resumed in the 1860s and the bridge was finished in 1864

Mr Ferguson claims the status would help preserve the 149-year-old bridge and bring in tourists.

He said: ‘I know from having lectured 
in many world heritage sites about world heritage that we have one of 
the great European world heritage sites - and that is the Clifton 
Suspension Bridge.’

The Clifton Suspension Bridge was 
designed by Brunel and completed in his memory in 1864, five years after
his death. It was originally meant for light horse drawn traffic.

But it now withstands the demands of 
modern commuters - with up to 12,000 vehicles crossing daily.

Proposals to double the bridge toll from 50p to £1 are to be the subject of a public inquiry after a backlash from locals.

Bridgemaster David Anderson said the structure, which attracts around 500,000 visitors each year, is worthy of protected status.

He added: 'Those of us who live in Bristol and are concerned with Bristol think the bridge is extremely important.

'It has to be preserved for the future. Whether it meets Unesco requirements it is a little bit too early to say but I think the bridge is very worthy of protection.

'There are around 500,000 visitors to 
the bridge each year and if we were to get World Heritage status that 
would only increase.'

There are currently 962 World Heritage sites across the world, with 745 cultural, 188 natural and 29 mixed.

The sites, which are nominated by the countries where they are situated, are protected by UN law under the Geneva Convention.

This makes it illegal to damage a site, use it in support of military effort or make it the object of a reprisal.
