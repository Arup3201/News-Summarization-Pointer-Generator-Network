Nearly two-thirds of people who have retired in Britain expect to leave an inheritance when they die of around £180,000, a report revealed yesterday.

The research shows British people are far more generous - or simply far richer - than people in many other countries, with their children typically being the lucky beneficiaries.

Of 15 countries which were investigated in the research, the UK came out third in the league table of inheritance windfalls around the world.

It was beaten by Australia and Singapore where retired people expect to leave an average of £322,000 and £238,000 respectively.

By comparison, the average amount that retired people expect to leave as an inheritance windfall is £95,000. All the figures are based on the inheritance after taxes have been paid and include the value of any property.

Overall, it found 64 per cent of people who have retired in Britain expect to leave an average inheritance of £182,144, which is nearly twice the international average.

But many plan to be even more generous.

One in five expect they will leave ‘over £250,000’ to their children or other beneficiaries, such as a charity, the local church, a more distant family member or a friend.

The report, from the banking giant HSBC, also reveals how the future of retirement will dramatically change for today’s workers.

On average, people of working age think they ‘will be able to afford to retire on average at 65.’ But this is four years’ later than their own parents’ retirement date, it says.

While workers expect to retire at 65, 
which is the current State pension age for men, their parent who was the
family’s main breadwinner retired at the age of 61.

One
in five people told researchers that they ‘expect that they will never 
to be able to afford to retire from all paid employment.’ Christine 
Foyster, head of wealth development at HSBC UK, said: ‘It is good to see
that, even in these tough times, parents plan to leave an inheritance 
to their children.

'However, it is vital that people do not rely on these potential windfalls to fund their retirement.

‘Whatever
their good intentions, parents may face their own unexpected hurdles 
and require the money to fund other things such as their own medical and
nursing care in later life.’

Nearly
one in three people of working age have already received ‘a significant
financial gift or loan from their family’. The typical amount was 
£8,190.

The poll was based on the views of more than 16,000 people in 15 countries. None of them were HSBC clients.
