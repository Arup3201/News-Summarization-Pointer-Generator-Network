Footballer Nile Ranger, who is accused of raping a woman, deleted a 'trophy photo' from his phone before handing it to police because 'he knew it would give the game away', a court has heard.

The 22-year-old took the picture of some bedding, a room key and a notepad in the £30-a-night Carlton Hotel in Jesmond, Newcastle after allegedly raping a woman he had been out drinking with.

But after being arrested on suspicion of rape, the former Newcastle United striker removed the image from his phone just minutes before handing over his belongings at the police station.

Asking Ranger about why he had taken the 
picture, Christine Egerton, prosecuting, said: 'It's not that you wanted a
 trophy is it?' and went on to accuse him of removing it because it was 
incriminating.

'You deleted that image from the phone that you had secreted on you minutes before,' she said.

'You
 had been deleting an incriminating image because you knew you had to 
hand your property over. You knew that it would give the game away, you 
knew you had done something wrong.'

Now with Swindon Town, and 
nursing a hamstring injury which meant he sat down to give evidence at 
Newcastle Crown Court, Ranger denies raping the woman and insists they 
had consensual sex.

He said he did not view the picture to be a 
trophy because it was not very pleasant and told the jury he could not 
remember why he had taken it.

Yesterday, he said he had never 
engaged in sexual activity with a woman against her wishes and that the 
pair had engaged in sex in different positions.

The alleged victim 
says she was raped in the Carlton Hotel, Jesmond, after agreeing to meet
 the footballer in a city centre bar.

She said she could not remember anything until she woke up naked in the hotel room the next morning.

Ranger told her she should take the morning after pill and she left, she said, and they continued to swap messages that day.

She then visited her GP, was checked at hospital and made a rape allegation to police.

The case was adjourned until Monday.
