They might have blown the Premier League title but Liverpool held out for top spot in the official fair play league.

Brendan Rodgers' men edged last season's winners Arsenal into second place, while Everton and Manchester City were also left trailing in third and fourth place.

Luis Suarez's improved performance played a factor in Liverpool's rise from third to first, the Uruguay international striker received just six yellow cards and no red cards in comparison to 10 the season before.

Liverpool emerged as surprise challengers for the Premier League title after embarking on a 16-game unbeaten run at from the beginning of 2014 which lasted until a 2-0 defeat against Chelsea on April 27.

That loss, combined with a 3-3 draw against Crystal Palace, after the Reds had led 3-0, meant that they finished second and two points behind eventual champions Man City.

In a bid to promote positive behaviour from Premier League teams and their players the fair play competition was established and assessed across five categories including red and yellow cards, positive play (e.g. showing attacking intent, speeding up the game, no time-wasting), respect towards opponents, respect towards the referee and behaviour of the team officials.

As a result of their achievement Liverpool will be awarded Â£30,000 by the Premier League which they can put toward community or youth projects.

Rodgers paid credit to his playing squad and staff for their exemplary behaviour: 'We are delighted to top the Fair Play League at the end of one of our most successful seasons in recent history,' he said.

'Our fans, players and staff make up what we like to call the world's greatest football family and as part of that we look to uphold the club's values which include unity, dignity and commitment, which have been shown throughout the season.'
