France has banned children’s beauty contests in an attempt to prevent the ‘hyper-sexualisation’ of youngsters.

A new law enacted on Tuesday night prevents anyone under the age of 16 from being judged on their physical appearance.

It follows concerns expressed all over the world, including Britain where pageants are still legal, about girls being forced to grow up too fast.

Now anyone caught organising a beauty competition for children in France faces up to two years in prison and fines equivalent of around 25,000 pounds.

The new law is part of an equality bill introduced by  women’s minister, Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, and now passed by the Paris Senate.

French senator Chantal Jouanno, author of a report called ‘Against Hyper-Sexualisation: A New Fight For Equality’ proposed an amendment to Vallaud-Belkacem’s bill, calling for the end of children’s contests.

It was passed by 196 votes to 146 against.  ‘Let’s not let our daughters think from such a young age that they will be judged according to their appearance,’ said Ms Jouanno. ‘Let’s not let commercial interest impact on social interest.’

There is a long tradition of young girls in France taking part in beauty pageants, which are usually called ‘Mini Miss’ competitions, with children and young teenagers  sometimes wearing make-up and high heels.

Many believe they are harmless fun, however, and there was fierce opposition to Ms Jouanno’s amendment.

She also wanted to bring in tough new regulations concerning child models, but these were rejected by the Senate.

Ms Jouanno was particularly concerned about a Vogue magazine shoot in 2010 featuring provocative photographs of a 10-year-old French girl.

The child, Thylane Loubry Blondeau, and two others wore make-up, tight dresses, high heels and designer jewellery.

Vogue defended the images, saying they merely portrayed the desire of young girls  to dress like their mothers.

While pageants have traditionally been a purely American phenomenon, with competitions across the States regularly filmed for downmarket reality shows such as Toddlers And Tiaras, they are becoming increasingly common in Britain.

The trend has attracted criticism from parenting groups and children's charities about the sexualisation of children.

The director of children's charity Kidscape, Claude Knights, warned recently: 'These children are so young, it's impossible for them to be giving their consent to wearing swimwear and pseudo-evening dresses, as well as fake eyelashes and spray tans.'
