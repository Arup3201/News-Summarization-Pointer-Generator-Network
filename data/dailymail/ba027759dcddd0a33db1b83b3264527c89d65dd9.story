Choice words: Yesterday David Cameron warned that Syrian president Bashar Assad was 'bent' on plunging his country into a full scale civil war

Yesterday David Cameron warned that Syrian president Bashar Assad was ‘bent’ on plunging his country into a full scale civil war.

A deadline to withdraw troops from populated areas has been widely flouted amid fresh reports of violence.

Speaking at a press conference in 
Jakarta, Indonsesia, Mr Cameron said 1,000 people have died this week, 
with 300 killed over the Easter weekend alone.

Former United Nations secretary 
general Kofi Annan has been pushing Damascus to withdraw its troops from
cities and halt violence.

But Mr Cameron said the bloodshed was
continuing, adding: ‘Far from fulfilling their commitments, the regime 
is cynically exploiting the window of diplomatic negotiations to crack 
down even harder on its own people.

‘With increasing refugee flows across
international borders, Assad’s actions are now threatening regional 
peace and security. We want to achieve a negotiated end to the Syrian 
crisis and avoid full-scale civil war. But Assad seems bent on doing 
precisely the opposite.’

Mr Cameron urged the UN Security 
Council – and particularly Russia – to bear down on Syria. He warned: 
‘It is clear that the world needs to redouble its efforts to stop the 
killing and intensify our support to those who oppose Assad’s savagery.

Cramped: Thousands of refugees have fled their homes to escape the fighting in this makeshift camp in in Kilis, just across the Syrian border in Turkey

‘This is a decisive moment. The UN 
Security Council now has a clear responsibility to throw its full weight
behind Kofi Annan’s plan and to insist that it is implemented in full.’

Tony Blair joined in the criticism saying Assad and other undemocratic regimes in the Middle East had a ‘very clear choice’ between accepting evolutionary change, or facing revolution.

He told Radio 4’s World at One programme: ‘They are given chance upon chance to come to a realistic way forward, which is a transition to a democratic form of government, which is what their people want. On each occasion they are given that chance they make promises and then they break those promises.

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said she would renew efforts to persuade Russia to apply pressure on Assad to stop the violence.

The Prime Minister will today urge Muslims around the world to inflict the ‘greatest defeat’ on ‘dead-end’ Islamic extremists by embracing democracy.

Mr Cameron will point to nations such as Indonesia as proof that Islam and democracy can ‘flourish’ against ‘dangerous foes’.

In a speech to students at a university in Jakarta, he will say that extremists feed ‘prejudice, persecution, terror and violence’.

‘These extremists try to turn Islam into a closed and warped ideology that is opposed to democracy,’ he will say.

‘What Indonesia shows is that in the world’s largest Muslim-majority country, it is possible to reject this extremist threat and prove that democracy and Islam can flourish alongside each other.’

Following the Bali terrorist bombings in 2002, Mr Cameron will say: ‘Some around the world even questioned whether Indonesia might face a bleak dead-end choice between extremism on the one hand and a return to dictatorship on the other.

‘Indonesia is showing us that it is possible to develop a democracy and a modern economy that neither compromises people’s security nor their ability to practise their religion.

Meanwhile damning photos have emerged
showing the makeshift cities that reveal the true scale of the 
humanitarian crisis sweeping across conflict-ravaged Syria.

Refugees have flocked in their thousands to camps like this in Kilis, just across the Syrian border in Turkey.

Gunfire can be clearly heard as pitch battles continue between government troops and rebel fighters.

And
their new homes, cramped and made from carbon fibre crating, provide 
little protection from stray bullets that may fall at any time.

On Tuesday UN Middle East envoy visited another camp in nearby in Hatay before flying to Iran to beg for in solving the deepening crisis as bombs continued to fall across the war-torn nation.

In
a desperate friend-finding mission to Tehran, special envoy Kofi Annan 
said Iran could play a vital role in halting Syria from slipping into 
all-out civil war.

His plea came as activists reported fresh violence a day before an international cease-fire is supposed to take effect.

Iran is one of Syria's strongest 
allies, and former U.N. chief Annan went there to bolster support for 
his faltering plan to stop the country's slide toward civil war

'Iran,
given its special relations with Syria, can be part of the solution,' 
Annan said during a news conference with Iran's Foreign Minister Ali 
Akbar Salehi. 'The geopolitical location of Syria is such that any 
miscalculation and error can have unimaginable consequences.'

Patience: Refugees hold signs and fly the Syrian flag as they wait to go back to their homes

Supplies: A truck delivers beds for the refugee camp as more pour in

However, Iran
has always opposed any foreign intervention in the crisis and Salehi insisted 
that 'change in Syria' should come under the leadership of Assad.

'Any change in Syria should be made by the Syrian 
government under the leadership of President Bashar al-Assad who 
promised to achieve these changes to meet the aspirations of the Syrian 
people,' Salehi added.

Annan visited Iran a day after US Senator John McCain said ground troops are now the only way of ousting defiant Syrian president Bashar al Assad and ending the violence.

During a visit to Yayladagi refugee camp in Hatay,on the 
Turkish-Syrian border with fellow senator Joe Lieberman yesterday, he said: 'I think it was a failure from the start. Most of us knew because there 
was no pressure for Bashar Assad to actually stop the killing. We think 
it's going to require military action on the ground to get him to 
leave.'

The conflict in Syria is among the most 
explosive of the Arab Spring, in part because of the country's 
allegiances to powerful forces including Lebanon's Hezbollah and Shiite 
powerhouse Iran.

Hundreds of refugees have fled the country, filling camps in neighbouring Turkey.

The uprising that began more than a year ago seeks the ouster of authoritarian President Bashar Assad.

Syria's
regime defied the Tuesday deadline to pull out troops from cities and 
towns that was set in the deal brokered by Annan and launched fresh 
attacks on rebellious areas.

But Annan insists there is still time to salvage the truce by 6 a.m. Thursday, the deadline for government and rebel fighters to cease all hostilities.

There was more violence on Wednesday, 
putting the chances of a truce even deeper in doubt as Syrian troops took 
control of large parts of villages and towns near the border with 
Turkey.

The Local Coordination Committees, an 
activist network, reported shelling of several rebel-held neighborhoods 
in the central city of Homs.

Meanwhile U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Russia's refusal to support constructive action by the U.N. Security Council on the crisis in Syria is keeping its President Bashar al-Assad in power.

Clinton said when foreign ministers of the G-8 meet in Washington on Wednesday, the U.S. would again try to persuade Russia, a key Syrian ally, to support action that would at least allow humanitarian access.

Clinton warned Tuesday night that the danger was rising of regional conflict and civil war flaring from the violence in Syria.

She said Russia's 'refusal to join us in some kind of constructive action is keeping Assad in power, well-armed, able to ignore the demands of his own people, the region and the world.'

China also weighed into the crisis today,  reiterating calls for all sides in Syria to respect a ceasefire as government forces pressed home a sustained assault on opponents of President Bashar al-Assad, ignoring an international peace plan.               

'A political solution to the Syrian issue has reached a critical stage, but violence within Syria continues and civilian casualties are rising. China expresses its deep worries,' Chinese Foreign

Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin told reporters at a daily press briefing.       

Peace envoy Kofi Annan appealed to the U.N. Security Council to use its leverage to prevent the collapse of his efforts to halt 13 months of conflict and said Assad must make a 'fundamental change of course' and adhere to a ceasefire due to begin on Thursday.            

Yesterday, Hezbollah demanded punishment for the killers of Al-Jadeed TV 
cameraman Ali Shaaban slain by Syrian gunfire near the border with Syria.

Shaaban, 30, was killed on Monday when Syrian troops opened fire on the car he was traveling in with two Al-Jadeed colleagues, reporter Hussein Khreiss and cameraman 
Abed al-Azim Khayya in the 
northern area of Wadi Khaled, near the border with Syria.
