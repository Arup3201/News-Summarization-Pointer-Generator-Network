The Euro dropped below 75p this morning as markets reacted to the election victory of an anti-austerity party in Greece.

George Osborne warned Britain's economic stability depends on a strong eurozone as the future of the single currency was plunged into crisis.

The Chancellor urged Greece's new leaders to act 'responsibly' after Syriza triumphed, warning that the institutions of the eurozone are 'not working well enough', which has an impact on the UK.

The result puts Greece on a collision course with finance ministers across the EU, after Syriza vowed to reopen Greece's vast bailout deal.

At 5pm, one euro was worth 74.82p, after falling to an 14-year low against the dollar overnight.

The euro has been falling in value against the pound and the dollar for more than a year, and there are fears about the impact of Syriza's election victory in Greece on the stability of the eurozone

The euro, already hammered by the stimulus package, sunk to a 14-year low against the US dollar overnight before pulling back some of the losses.

The pound rose to a new near-seven-year high of 1.35 against the single currency though, again, this was pared back later.

But British and European stock markets appeared to shrug off the result, which many analysts had predicted. 

The FTSE 100 finished in positive territory - ending up 19.57 points. French and German markets also posted gains, suggesting the markets had already 'priced in' a Syriza victory.

Alexis Tsipras's Syriza won the poll, but fell just short of an overall majority. 

He has pledged to renegotiate Greece's 240 billion euro (£179 billion) international bailout deal, and reverse many of the reforms that creditors demanded in exchange for keeping Greece financially afloat since 2010.

The result threatens the continued membership of Greece in the 19-bloc currency. The FTSE 100 Index opened down by just under 0.5 per cent lower. 

Mr Osborne, who is on a visit to Cornwall, said relying on spending more money to get out of difficulties was a 'panacea, false hope'.

'Ultimately, if you take at face value all the things that the new Greek government has promised, including new big increases in public expenditure, I think that is going to be very difficult to deliver and incompatible with what the eurozone currently demands of its members,' he said.

'But I hope that both sides now act responsibly.

'Everyone has in the past looked over the precipice of Greek exit from the euro and pulled back. It is certainly in the UK's interest that we have stability, that we have proper dialogue here between members of the euro.

'But ultimately what the UK needs is a strong partner, and the institutions of the eurozone are not working well enough for the people of Europe, and that has an impact on us.'

British Chancellor George Osborne, pictured today on a visit to Taunton in Somersert, urged all sides in Greece to 'now act responsibly' to prevent a new financial crisis

In a message on Twitter last night, David Cameron also cautioned over the effects of the crisis.

'The Greek election will increase economic uncertainty across Europe. That's why the UK must stick to our plan, delivering security at home,' he wrote.

Yanis Varoufakis, a Syriza MP tipped to become Greece's next finance minister, told BBC Radio  that the country's austerity programme had been like 'waterboarding'.

But he insisted that a Greek exit from the euro was not 'on the cards' and the party would not take a 'confrontational' approach.

'There has been a bit of posturing on our side. What really matters now is that we sit down and discuss a way that the haircut to our debt - the debt writedown - is minimised,' he said.

'Grexit is not on the cards, we are not going to Brussels or Frankfurt and Berlin in a confrontational style...

'To have this debt schedule, debt repayment schedule as we do at the moment, which is completely unrealistic and utterly disconnected from Greek growth, that is not good for them, it is not good for us. What we want to do is bind our repayments to our growth.'

A triumphant Alexis Tsipras told Greeks that his radical left party's win meant an end to 'austerity and destruction'

Supporters crowded the streets of Athens to hear Mr Tsipras speak outside the city's University Headquarters

The Green party has backed Syriza's anti-austerity victory and pinned its hopes on a left-wing uprising in the UK.

Green MP Caroline Lucas said she had been 'inspired' by the 'huge vote' for Syriza.

'Now EU must listen to people & economists & respond with debt forgivenesss & support,' she wrote on Twitter. 

Green MEPs Scott Cato and Keith Taylor also called for an anti-austerity revolution in Britain.

'Greens share the view of the new government that austerity is a failed model which has piled misery on the poorest while making the wealthiest even richer,' they said in a statement.

They added: 'This result shows that challenging business as usual politics can win the support of the people. 

'In the UK we are witnessing a Green Surge, in no small part due to our anti-austerity agenda, and we hope the Greek election result marks the beginnings of ordinary people standing up to a discredited economic model and failing Governments across Europe.'

CMC Markets chief analyst Michael Hewson said: 'It's events in Europe that are at the epicentre of the markets focus once again, and the victory of the anti-austerity party Syriza in the latest Greek elections, and the ramifications of which could well ripple out across Europe through the rest of this year, as elections loom in Portugal, Spain as well as Italy.'

The election result comes after the European Central Bank last week set out a 1.1 trillion euro (£820 million) asset purchase programme, an event which has already weakened the euro.

Last month, inflation in the eurozone turned negative for the first time since 2009, partly due to the recent sharp fall in oil prices.

IG chief market strategist Chris Weston added: 'If the trend through Europe is to reject austerity, reduce the shackles of debt and look for more pro-growth measures, then Greece has set a strong precedent and parties like the newly-formed Podemos in Spain will be keen to see if this trend can spill over as they approach national elections later in the year.'

A triumphant Mr Tsipras told Greeks that his radical left party's win meant an end to 'austerity and destruction'.

'The Greek people have made history. Hope has made history,' Mr Tsipras said in his victory speech at a conference hall in central Athens.

Mr Tsipras said his party's victory had made the 'troika a thing of the past', referring to the three international institutions - the European Union, International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank - that have carried out inspections to monitor Greece's progress before approving each instalment of bailout funds.

'The verdict of the Greek people ends, beyond any doubt, the vicious circle of austerity in our country,' Mr Tsipras said.

'The verdict of the Greek people, your verdict, annuls today in an indisputable fashion the bailout agreements of austerity and disaster.

'The verdict of the Greek people renders the troika a thing of the past for our common European framework.'

The result in Greece is being watched closely by financial markets around the world, including Tokyo (pictured)

It is expected Mr Tsipras will meet the leader of the small Independent Greeks party later today 'to confirm the support and possible participation of the Independent Greeks in the new government,' according to a Syriza official.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: 'This is a desperate cry for help from the Greek people, millions of whom have been impoverished by the euro experiment.

'An extraordinary game of poker will now begin with Chancellor Merkel, with the European Central Bank powerless to do much than be an observer.'

Labour's former Europe minister Peter Hain compared the measures imposed on the Greeks to the restrictions placed upon Germany after the First World War.

On Twitter he said: 'Fantastic Syriza win: austerity does not work for Greece, for Tory/Lib Dem UK, nor for EU; we all need investment in growth not savage cuts.'
