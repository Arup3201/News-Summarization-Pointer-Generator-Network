British Airways has apologised to a Shropshire family who spent 25 hours at a New York airport before their journey back to the UK.

The Smiths said they slept on the floor and used their coats as bedding at John F Kennedy International Airport, where thousands of travellers were stranded over the weekend by a winter storm.

Their return flight, which was cancelled, was a codeshare operated by American Airlines, although the family’s package holiday was booked through BA.

Andrew Smith, 38, said the transatlantic trip was the first time they had flown with BA – and possibly the last as they weren't happy with the partner airlines.

Andrew, from Bishop’s Castle, claims there was a lack of information from staff inside the terminal, and BA and American Airlines could have done more to help passengers book new flights.

He claims American Airlines staff 'disappeared' after the flight was cancelled and they told passengers to collect their luggage and rebook their flights.

He told MailOnline Travel: ‘I understand all the delays for the weather, that’s not the issue. They just shrugged their shoulders and said we can’t do anything about it.’

Andrew Smith sent a series of tweets to British Airways to complain about his family's experience

Andrew said he called BA and rebooked their flights, and then went to a BA desk inside the airport.

He said: 'A manager basically laughed at us and said, "It’s not our problem, it’s American Airlines’ problem".

'I’d like an apology from American Airlines and BA for the way the staff treated me and everyone else at that airport. It's totally unacceptable.'

The family complained to BA and received an apology, a £250 voucher for a future trip and reimbursement for their costs at the airport.

Still, Andrew said he isn't satisfied with the apology.

He said: ‘It’s not an apology for the way the staff treated us. They’ve apologised for the inconvenience and it’s a gesture of good will.’

A BA spokesman said the airline's customer relations team offered an apology that covered 'the whole experience', and will contact the family again to repeat it.

Andrew said a BA employee who he spoke to on the phone offered a free hotel stay, but he declined the offer because they had to wait until about 8am to collect their luggage and they 'would only be [in the room] for a couple of hours' before they had to return for their rescheduled flight.

He said: 'The offer was there in theory but on the practical side of that it was no good.'

Andrew travelled to the Big Apple with his wife, Tracy, and their children – Chelsea, 17, Robbie, 12, and eight-year-old Hudson – to celebrate Tracy’s 37th birthday.

They had a fantastic time taking in the sights, sounds and culinary delights in America’s most populous city, but claim the trip went awry after they boarded their flight to London Heathrow Airport.

They were scheduled to depart on Saturday night and land in London on Sunday morning, but a winter storm caused delays for thousands of other travellers.

The plane carrying the Smiths sat on the runway for four hours and had to return to the gate because of bad weather.

The family holiday to New York was intended as a way to celebrate Tracy Smith's 37th birthday 

British Airways responded to Andrew Smith after he complained that he had been 'let down'

The airline informed the Smiths that flights across the US East Coast were affected by a winter storm

The delay was made worse for passengers when the captain announced that the flight was cancelled because its crew was nearing its maximum allowable hours and required rest.

Passengers had to wait another six hours to retrieve their luggage, said Andrew.

He said his family slept on their suitcases in the departure lounge – catching very little shut-eye – and spent several more hours inside the terminal before their flight departed Sunday night.

‘Two of my children had to miss a day of school due to the delays and there is a possibility that we will be fined for doing so.’

The Smiths were supposed to return to the UK on Sunday morning, but didn't arrive until Monday afternoon

Icy weather closed John F Kennedy International Airport last weekend, leaving thousands stranded

Andrew Smith complained to British Airways and American Airlines, which operated the codeshare flight

A British Airways spokeswoman told MailOnline Travel: ‘We are sorry that the family were delayed on their journey back to the UK.

‘During the delay, we did offer them hotel accommodation for the night, and we will be reimbursing the costs they incurred at the airport.' 

While the family was stranded at the airport, Andrew sent a series of tweets to BA, including a photo purportedly showing his wife and children sleeping on the floor.

A BA employee responded with two tweets, writing: ‘I understand you're frustrated, it's never acceptable for our passengers to be in this position. Regrettably, all transportation across the East Coast has been affected by a severe winter storm.’

Andrew said he checked the weather reports and was surprised flights were being cancelled. 

But the weather was so poor that JFK Airport closed two runways on Sunday morning as its crews cleared snow and ice.

Passengers aboard an Air France flight from New York to Paris also experienced lengthy delays as a result of the weather and staffing.

Their flight departed New York six hours behind schedule early Sunday morning and was forced to divert to Manchester Airport because its flight crew was approaching its limit for flight time as a result of the initial delay.

The Airbus A380 was forced to remain at Manchester Airport because of a cabin pressure problem.

As a result, Air France sent three additional Airbus aircraft – two A320s and an A318 – to pick up the passengers and fly them to Paris.

Some passengers were nearly 20 hours behind schedule when they arrived at Paris’ Charles de Gaulle Airport.
