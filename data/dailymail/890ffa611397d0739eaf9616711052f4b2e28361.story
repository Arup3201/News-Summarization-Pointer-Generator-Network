Two-time world champion Scott Harrison will make his ring return after an 18-month absence on October 31.

The 37-year-old has not fought since losing by unanimous decision to Norfolk's Liam Walsh at the Wembley Arena in April last year.

But the former WBO world featherweight champion has now signed on with newly-formed Phoenix Promotions and has already pencilled in a date for his return after his boxing licence was reinstated by the British Boxing Board of Control last month following a year-long suspension.

Ban: Scott Harrison served a one-year suspension  and has also served prison sentences in  the UK

The fight will take place in Glasgow but firm details for the venue and opponent have yet to be released.

Harrison, who has served lengthy prison sentences in both Britain and Spain in the past six years, was suspended by the BBBoC last year when he failed to provide proof that he was no longer being sought by the Spanish authorities.

He said: 'I am looking forward to starting a new chapter in my career, working with Jay Anderson at Phoenix Promotions, a boxing promotional company that I believe will shake up Scottish boxing.'

Anderson added: 'I am delighted to have Scott on board, who in my opinion is one of the best fighters Scotland has ever produced.

'We are looking forward to the journey ahead with ambitious plans and exciting times in Scottish boxing.'
