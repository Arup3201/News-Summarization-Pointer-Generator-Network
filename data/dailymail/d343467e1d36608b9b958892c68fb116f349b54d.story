A former Soprano's star who has recently been released from prison hopes to return to acting following his incarceration.

In fact, Lillo Brancato, 37, already has his first on-camera role lined up.

Brancato was sentenced to 10 years for his role in a botched robbery that led to the shooting death of an off-duty NYPD police officer.

He must stay with his family in New York's Yonkers for at least six months under the conditions of his parole.

Brancato told the New York Post that his friend nightclub owner and sometime producer Noel Ashman is producing a
 short fim in which he will star that begins shooting later this month.

'I
 really do love acting, and for any opportunity, for anyone to take a 
chance on me so quickly, it’s humbling and I’m just so grateful,' Brancato said.

After that, he said, he'd like to move to the West Coast and try and resurrect his once-promising acting career.

Brancato rose to fame in the 1993 
movie A Bronx Tale, playing a young kid from the neighborhood who is 
torn between two worlds and two men: a local mobster played by Chazz 
Palmintieri and his straight-and-narrow bus-driver father, played by 
Robert DeNiro.

Other 
roles followed, most notably a stint on the second season of The 
Sopranos. His character carried out a series of low-level crimes for the
 New Jersey mob before being gunned down by Tony Soprano and his 
sidekick as he tearfully begged for his life.

Brancato told the New York Daily News that he hopes to get back in touch with DeNiro and Pamintieri.

'These are the guys who gave me my first shot,' he said. 'I’d muse they’re definitely disappointed in what happened, and I just want to let them know I’m sorry for that.

'I want to show them I’m no longer that person, and I used my time in prison wisely.'

Release: Lillo Brancato will be freed from prison tomorrow after serving four years of a ten-year sentence for a burglary which resulted in the death of a NYPD officer

that they were outraged by this decision and reiterated their belief 
that Brancato was respons

Yolanda Rosa, the sister of Enchautegui, said that she was notified only on Tuesday that Brancato would be released on Wednesday after being granted parole earlier in the month.

'I’m still upset that he was not convicted of the murder, and that he did not serve enough time,' Yolanda Rosa said to the New York Post.

'I don’t know how I will feel tomorrow when he is free, walking on the streets, while my brother will not.'

Authorities told Rosa that Brancato had been a model prisoner behind bars, a suggestion she scoffed at.

'Well, he wasn't a model citizen before - we’ll see if he’s a model citizen after he gets out,' she added.

Speaking to the New York Daily News, Rosa expressed her disbelief that the once-promising young actor would be released so soon.

'He didn’t serve enough time. He was equally as responsible as the other guy,' Rosa said.

'Not a day goes by that I don’t think about my brother.'

Announcement: Lillo Brancato took to Twitter from prison to announce that he was being released from jail on December 31

Grief: Police Officer Daniel Enchautegui's father Pedro Enchautegui (3rd L) is consoled by a police officer as others prepare to carry his casket out of St. John's Chrysostom Church after his funeral mass in New York December 14, 2005

Prosecutors said that in December 2005, Brancato and Steven Armento broke into the Bronx house of a friend looking to steal prescription drugs after a night of drinking at a strip club.

Officer Enchautegui heard the commotion next door from his homeand went to investigate.

Armento shot the 28-year-old officer with the .357 Magnum he was carrying in the heart and the dying officer fired back shooting both men.

As a result of the death of an officer, Brancato was charged with second-degree murder - but was only convicted of burglary in 2008 and was sentenced to serve 10 years and five-years probation in 2009.

Armento was sentenced to life in prison without parole after being found guilty of first-degree murder.

In a statement Monday, PBA President Patrick J. Lynch said he believed Brancato was guilty in the officer’s death.

'It is our firm belief that Lillo Brancato is guilty of the murder of police officer Daniel Enchautequi even though he was only convicted of attempted burglary.

'Even while incarcerated, this lowlife thug showed his true colors when he beat up a fellow inmate who wouldn’t get off a pay phone quickly enough,' Lynch said in the statement.

Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association trustee Joe Anthony said he was outraged by the decision by the parole board.

'I sat in the courtroom everyday with the family while that smug punk smiled and laughed at them,' he said.

'I hope someone taught him respect in prison.'

Brancato, who was allowed to maintain a Twitter account while serving his sentence, posted a message of thanks online to all his supporters.

'With that being said, this will be my last tweet from prison. Thank you for your love and support. I love you all!' he tweeted to his 3,364 followers.

HBO hit : Lillo Brancato appears in the seminal mob drama The Sopranos in the early years of the 2000s

Brancato, now 36, and Armento, 51 , were drinking together at a strip club in December 2005 before deciding to break into the basement apartment in a hunt for Valium, prosecutors said during the 2008 trial.

Brancato testified during the trial there was a never a break-in.

He claimed that he had known the owner, a Vietnam veteran, for several years. He also said he had permission to go inside and take painkillers and other pills whenever he felt like it, and didn't know the man had died earlier that year.

The pills were part of a drug problem that he said began when he was 'introduced to marijuana' on the set of A Bronx Tale. He later became hooked on crack and heroin, he said.

He told the jury that while suffering from judgment-impairing heroin withdrawals on the night of the shooting, he accidentally broke the kitchen window of the apartment in a desperate attempt to wake up his old pill-supplier.

'I was becoming dope sick,' Brancato testified. 'Mentally, I was a mess.'

Brancato tried to deflect suggestions by the prosecution that his testimony - at times punctuated by vignettes about his drug-crazed downfall - was another acting job.

Warm welcome: Not everyone is as pleased as Lillo Brancato's family that he has been released from prison early, including Rosa Enchautegui, sister of the officer shot dead during the 2005 robbery

Media attention: Brancato says he is a reformed drug addict and alcoholic, and has been attending AA meetings in his hometown of Yonkers, New York

Brancato says his drug problem was so severe his own family nearly disowned him, and that he was still using at Rikers.

‘I had all these people supporting me, and they finally had had it,' he told the New York Post. 'They told me if I kept going like I was going, they wouldn’t be there.''It really woke me up.'

He says he has been clean since November 18, 2006.

While behind bars, he got a degree in business management and administration.

Ashman says he believes Brancato is sincere.

‘Lillo has a good heart,' Ashman told the Post. 'He got sidetracked [by drugs] and it changed him. It was hard, at times, not to give up on him. He hurt a lot of people. He has a lot to prove to earn  back their respect. But I hope people are willing to give him another chance.'

Brancato has been busy catching up with his family, many of the youngest members of which he is meeting for the first time.

'I am going to do whatever it takes to show that I am sincere, that I am sober, that I am grateful and that I can be trusted - however long it takes,' he told the Post.
