A railway passenger was left stunned after she needed a staggering 14 tickets just for a simple return train trip.

Project manager Rachel Woodward, 28, booked the easy journey from Leeds to Leicester online, only to be bamboozled by a huge pile of paperwork.

When she arrived at the station she was shocked and confused when the machine spewed out 14 separate tickets for the £16.50 trip - plus a receipt.

Confused: Rachel Woodward and her bike needed more than a dozen separate tickets just to travel 200 miles by train

Barmy: Rachel holds the wad of 14 tickets  - which cost her £16.50 - and a receipt that flowed endlessly out of the machine

The pile included two tickets for herself, four seat reservations, four tickets for her bike as well as four further bike reservations.

This stack of tickets was needed to cover Rachel changing trains at Sheffield and for her return journey home.

Ms Woodward has said the amount of tickets was 'confusing' as she did not know which one to show at the barrier or show the guard on board the train.

And now the Association of Train Companies say they are looking at reducing the amount of tickets passengers need as a result.

The 28-year-old, from Leeds, West Yorkshire, said: 'When I was at the machine the tickets would just not stop coming out.

'At first I thought there was something wrong because there were 15 bits of card.

'There were ticket reservations for me, ticket reservations for my bike, and because we changed trains and it was a return trip there more and more tickets.'

2x passenger tickets

4x seat reservations

4x cycle tickets

4x cycle reservations

TOTAL = 14 tickets

She added: 'It’s confusing because with 14 tickets I wasn’t sure which one I needed for the automatic barrier.

'When the guard came on board to check my ticket he had to go through them all and help me give him the correct one.

'I think it’s also really wasteful, especially at a time when people are becoming more conscious of the environment.

'I don’t see why we can’t have an Oyster card like in London or a bit of paper with a barcode on it.'

Fourteen-ticket journey: Return trip  from Leeds to Leicester and back was 200 miles

A spokesperson for the Association of Train Operating Companies said: 'Train companies have been involved for some time now in a series of projects to improve the information they provide to passengers including a redesign of tickets to make them easier to understand.

'A lot has been done to make things as straightforward as possible for passengers and we are committed to doing better.'

Too much: The machine continued to spew tickets and now train operators are looking to reduce the number needed to travel

The 28-year-old's experience prompted a review by rail bosses who admitted the paperwork was 'excessive'
