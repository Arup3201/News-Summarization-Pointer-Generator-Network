With tips such as using an airtight tin to stop cakes going stale, her first foray into publishing was much derided for stating the obvious.

But apparently that hasn’t deterred Pippa Middleton from putting pen to paper – or from giving advice. 

The Duchess of Cambridge’s sister has been appointed a ‘contributing editor’ for Vanity Fair, signing a lucrative deal to supply the respected US magazine with her thoughts on ‘classic British pastimes’.

Family ties: Pippa Middleton joins the Duchess of Cambridge in the royal box on Centre Court during the men's final last year

And to start, she’s serving up a personal guide to the Wimbledon Championships, which begins on June 24.

Among her snippets of Wimbledon wisdom are such pearls as leave enough time to get to the tennis, avoid walking long distances in stilettos and don’t plan to go for dinner with friends afterwards in case the matches run over.

‘There’s nothing worse than having to leave Rafael Nadal’s athleticism for a routine pizza with friends,’ she advises.

There are also positive observations on the Wimbledon pigeons and suggestions for what to eat after the match – as well as recollections of trips to the tournament with her sister, whom she joined in the royal box for the men’s final last year. 

Pippa describes how the pair queued from 5am on ‘People’s Sunday’ to secure £35 tickets for Centre Court in 2004, during the early years of Kate’s courtship with Prince William.

The six-page feature also includes a glossy photoshoot showing Pippa, 29, in form-fitting tennis whites as she leaps athletically in the air – with make-up and hair still immaculate, of course. 

Pippa, who was working for an events company and helping at family firm Party Pieces when her sister married Prince William two years ago, became known around the world following the wedding. 

She soon secured a book deal worth a reported £400,000 for a tome on entertaining.

Unfortunately, Celebrate was universally lambasted when it was published last year.

The criticism did not prevent her from being signed up as a cookery columnist for Waitrose’s monthly in-store magazine. But this did not go down well either, with readers complaining about her choice of expensive ingredients and her lack of kitchen experience. 

However Vanity Fair, which has a circulation of more than 1.2million in the US, was keen to publicise its new signing last night. Editor Graydon Carter said: ‘We are delighted to have Pippa as a contributor.

‘She’s a keen observer of classic British pastimes. She is also an avid sportswoman, and we look forward to her take on traditional English pursuits.’
