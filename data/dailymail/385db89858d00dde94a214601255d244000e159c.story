Myleene Klass won a whole new legion of fans after she took on Ed Miliband over his 'mansion tax in November last year.

The former singer tore into the Labour leader's plans to tax properties worth more than £2million, calming it would hit 'little grannies' and not the super-wealthy.

However, it has emerged that the 36-year-old TV presenter's crusade may not have been so selfless, as she recently bought a £3million house in North London.

Taxing issues: Myleene Klass has just purchased a £3million home in London, which would come under Labour's proposed mansion tax  

Miss Klass tackled  Ed Miliband on live TV over Labour's proposed mansion tax, claiming the tax would his 'grannies' and Londoners living in garage-sized homes

Ms Klass and Mr Miliband went head to head on ITV's The Agenda in November, where she accused the Labour leader of not understanding what you would get for £2million in London. 

'For me, what is so disturbing is the name in its own right: "mansion",' Ms Klass fumed. 

'Immediately you conjure up in your head these Barbie-esque houses but in London, which is where 80 per cent of the people who are going to be paying this tax actually live, have you seen what that amount of money can get you? Often it's like a garage.

''The people who are the super-super rich buying their houses for £140 million, this is not necessarily going to affect them because they've got their tax rebates and their amazing accountants. It's going to be the little grannies who have lived in those houses for years and years.'

Ms Klass is thought to have purchased the multi-million pound home in an affluent area of the capital last summer, but it is not yet known if she and her two daughters have moved in.

Ms Klass recently lived in a rented house nearby, and her move was revealed when she filed the paperwork for the business with Companies House last month.

The house sold for £3,075,000 last summer and has eight bedrooms, four bathrooms and three reception rooms.

A demographic area profile describes Ms Klass's new neighbourhood as 'home to an older and often retired population some with school age children.' 

Ms Klass's new homestead is not far from fellow TV-profile Jonathan Ross, but the area is otherwise not considered a celebrity hub.

This week, the former former Pop Idol star returned from her New Year's holiday on a mystery island location with some of her loved ones, including daughters Ava, seven, and Hero, three. 

The mother-of-two ensured she mixed business and pleasure, and has been posting images of herself in swimwear, from her own Littlewoods collection. 

Myleene split from the girls' father and her partner of 10 years, Graham Quinn, back in April 2012 when he walked out of the marital home on her 34th birthday. 

But the star has since found love once again with a mystery man, whose identity she has managed to keep under wraps.

Speaking about her new boyfriend, Myleene recently told Women's Health magazine: 'I’ve learnt how to laugh and be fun and to not feel like just "Mum" again

'He doesn’t work in the business,’ she added. 'A girl’s got to keep something to herself and ultimately you just want a nice guy.’
