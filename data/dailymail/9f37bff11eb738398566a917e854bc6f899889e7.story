A Russian gymnast who can lift a 14kg kettleball with her private parts officially has the world's strongest vagina.

Tatyana Kozhevnikova, who is set to show off her skills on E4's The Body Shocking Show, can use just the muscles in her vagina to lift incredibly hefty weights.

The programme will showcase Kozhevnikova in all her glory utilising her record-breaking nether regions to lift 6kg dumbbells.

In a sneak preview of the show, which will air on E4 later this month, she can be seen lifting the dumbbells, which are equivalent to the weight of two melons, using just her vagina.

Kozhevnikova has already made her mark in the Guinness Book of World Records which recorded her lifting a 14kg glass ball with her genitals.

Speaking to The Morning Star in 2009, she said: 'After I had a child, my intimate muscles got unbelievably weak.

'I read books on Dao and learned that ancient women used to deal with this problem using wooden balls. 'I looked around, saw a Murano glass ball and inserted it into my vagina. It took me ages to get it out!'

Kozhevnikova uses custom-made vaginal balls and a variation of weights to strengthen her core muscles.

According to her website, she even offers special pelvic training programmes for men, which promises 'ideal buttocks in five days'.The Body Shocking Show is on E4 at 10pm on 14th March.
