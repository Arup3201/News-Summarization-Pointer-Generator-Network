Ben and Will are bright, sporty boys. Seven-year-old Will is a fan of martial arts while his elder brother Ben, 12, would love to be a rugby player when he grows up.

But, like many children, one of their favourite pastimes is playing computer games, and they spend hours every week playing on the family's iPad. Like most modern parents, Nicky Hayes, 39, and her husband Simon, 45, admit there's a convenience factor in allowing their sons to play these games.

But the couple, from Ashtead, Surrey, are now fastidious about the security settings on their iPad, having learnt their lesson the hard - and expensive - way.

Concern: Kathryn Bennett and her grandson Alfie, who unwittingly spent
£3,500 playing games on her iPad

'We've changed our password and disabled a setting which allowed the boys to purchase games or credits for a game without us knowing,' says Nicky. 'We've added every parental control you can think of.'

The couple are ever-vigilant because, two years ago, Will racked up a debt of £1,200 on his mother's debit card by playing a supposedly ‘free’ game on the iPad.

Only five at the time, the youngster had no idea that the game, which encouraged him to purchase 'virtual zombie brains', would result in his parents paying real money.

While they were stunned that their young son could run up such a debt, Nicky, a business consultant, and Simon, a property developer, were lucky to be able to take the financial hit.

But not every parent is as fortunate - and the consequences can be tragic.

Last month, an inquest heard how 13-year-old Lancashire schoolboy Henry Tattersall hanged himself after spending £422 online on Xbox games. While the coroner ruled that Henry had intended to be found, the tragic incident happened after his mother confronted him over the bill.

children with so-called "free" games then enable them to buy "add-ons" 
for extortionate sums of money

Numerous other children have unwittingly spent fortunes on their parents' credit or debit cards. Last summer, eight-year-old Lilly Neale, from Somerset, ran up almost £4,000, while Theo Rowland-Fry, eight, from Bristol, spent £1,000. Danny Kitchen, also from Bristol, was five when he racked up a £1,700 bill on a zombie game.

The first time Nicky Hayes realised something was wrong was when she went to the cash machine and discovered her balance was £1,000 short.

Her bank told her the purchases had been made on iTunes, Apple's media player which lets you download music, games and videos.

'I knew it wasn't me - I hadn't bought anything from iTunes recently,' she says. 'Then I went into my account online and saw dozens of purchases. Over a two to three-day period, one of my sons had spent £1,200 on a game where they had to pay to acquire virtual zombie brains.

'It was part of a free game we'd downloaded. I wasn't aware you could spend money on it. I rang Apple, who were remarkably unhelpful. They said that as the purchases had been made legitimately, they couldn't refund the money.

'I told them it had been spent without my authorisation, but they just weren't interested.

'We'd always been careful to protect our iPad with a password and not to tell the boys what it was but, like every customer, we'd had to input our card details to sign up to iTunes, and these details were stored.

'It turned out Will had watched me inputting the password and memorised it. The game kept asking him if he wanted to buy more for £50 and he kept pressing the "yes" button. He didn't think he'd spent "real money".'

Dr Kevin Curran, a lecturer in computer science at the University of Ulster, says incidents such incidents are common - and a major problem.

'Of course, a password is required, but even if a parent never lets their child know it, there are loopholes which allow a child to purchase without a parent's knowledge,' he says.

Louise Worth, 50, found this out when she let her ten-year-old son, Alex, play a free game called Six-Guns last year.

When I got the bill, I was furious, but Alex genuinely didn't realise he'd been spending money

The housewife from Barnet, north London, realised he'd spent £250 only when she checked her email and found 28 iTunes invoices.

'Alex doesn’t know my password, but one evening he'd been playing a game with my permission and it kept asking if he wanted to go up a level, so he kept pressing "yes".

'When I got the bill, I was furious, but Alex genuinely didn't realise he'd been spending money. He thought the game was offering him "prizes". I rang Apple who said their terms and conditions meant they didn't have to give the money back. I was furious.

'That's when Apple checked my account and found a 15-minute time-limit setting on it, which allowed for purchases without a password as long as they were all made within 15 minutes of the first password being entered.

'They said that Alex must have made all 28 purchases within that 15-minute time-frame, but I thought that was impossible.

'For two weeks I fought the decision, and three times Apple came back and said they would not refund the money. Eventually, they backed down and paid it.

'But they made it clear this was a once-only offer. They were very arrogant about it. It makes me so cross that Apple target children with so-called "free" games then enable them to buy "add-ons" for extortionate sums of money.'

Lesson learnt: The Bennetts eventually got their money back

Around 90 per cent of apps are now "freemium" - which means that the app is free to download but payments are required to unlock features or purchase extra items. Many of these items are attractive to children, such as virtual jewels, sweets or zombie brains.

A study last year revealed that parents had lost £30 million thanks to children's unauthorised purchases. It's a problem that extends far beyond the UK. Recently in the U.S., Apple agreed to refund at least £66 million to parents whose children had racked up in-app bills.

Now, the UK's Office of Fair Trading has announced the introduction of new in-app purchases standards, so that from April 1, all apps should clearly disclose information about the costs associated with a game before it’s downloaded.

This all comes too late for Roger Bennett, 66, whose grandson Alfie, eight, spent £3,500 on his iPad last year while playing games such as Clash of the Clans, Beat the Boss and Temple Run.

Roger, a retired fire officer from Worcester, says it was his wife Kathryn, 63, a retired teacher, who noticed that something was awry.

'Our Apple iTunes account is connected to a bank account that we don't use very often, and when Kathryn realised we were £1,300 overdrawn on it, we knew something was wrong,' he says.

The couple asked their grandchildren whether they had been buying anything online.

'Alfie looked a bit sheepish. He has ADHD and can be manic at times, but when he's playing on the iPad, he's calm. So we downloaded some free games, not realising there is a 15-minute slot when you can buy extras without having to put the card details back in.

'When I found out what he'd done, I was furious, but we couldn't shout at him because he hadn't realised what was happening.'

When Roger contacted Apple, they offered to refund just £500 because of Alfie's special needs. It was only when a journalist friend became involved that they agreed to pay back the full amount.

'It's a lot of money, so we were very grateful,' says Roger.

'It's a lesson for all of us. I've heard of many others who have been in a similar situation. One friend's son spent nearly £8,000 on his dad's credit card.

'I blame Apple, not the children. They've made a lot of money out of it.'

The Mail contacted Apple, but the company declined to comment.
