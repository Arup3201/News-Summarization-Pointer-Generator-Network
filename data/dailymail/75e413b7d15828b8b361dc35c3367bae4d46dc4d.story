A patent application filed by Apple has revealed that its long-mooted iWatch could use the same technology as a child's slap wrap to mount a flexible touchscreen on a user's wrist.

The innovative design, published for the first time today, reveals the technologies that could one day be seen in an Apple wearable computer.

It comes after tidal waves of rumours and speculation on exactly what an iWatch might be like, including a range of designers revealing their take on the 'smart watch' - but none managed to predict what has emerged.

A Japanese patent in February detailing Apple's plans for an iWatch followed an earlier application to the U.S Patent Office in 2011. This image, taken from the American Patent Application describes a 'wearable accessory device' which mounts a touchscreen on the user's wrist using the same technology as a slap wrap

U.S. patent application no. 20130044215, filed by Apple in August 2011, specifies the technology for a 'wearable accessory device' with a 'flexible display'.

It describes: 'A wearable video device ... comprising: a flexible substrate having a flat state and a curled state [and] a flexible display disposed upon a first surface of the flexible substrate.'

The wrist band type device described in the patent application would attach to users' wrists using the same kind of mechanism as a slap wrap toy.

Apple's latest patent application suggests the company is pushing forward with its plans to launch what's been dubbed the iWatch. A patent image, pictured, shows what the strap could look like

Popular among youngsters in the late Eighties and early-Nineties, slap wraps are bracelets consisting of layered, flexible stainless steel bi-stable spring bands sealed within a fabric or plastic cover.

The bracelet can be straightened out, causing tension within the springy metal bands, then slapped against a wearer's forearm, causing the bands to spring back into a curve that wraps around the wrist.

As expected by many Apple observers, the iWatch-like device described in the '44215 patent app would be 'configured to display information wirelessly transmitted from a portable electronic device', most likely an iPhone.

As well as the touch-sensitive display, the application says it would include 'a communication link, allowing two-way communication between the slap bracelet and the portable electronic device.'

'Information generated on either device can be displayed on either the host device display or the flexible display,' the application says.

Some of the most interesting innovations described by the application involve the manner in which the device could be powered.

'The battery can take many forms,' it suggests. 'For example, the battery can be distributed in nature by which it is meant that portions of the battery can be placed in disparate locations in the accessory.'

It also describes methods in which the battery life could be extended, including a 'solar panel array spread across a surface of the accessory device', or 'a kinetic power source similar to those found on some wristwatches.'

'An accessory device designed to be worn on a leg or arm could greatly benefit from this sort of power generation, and could lengthen the amount of time between charging,' the application says.

Accessory: The device would sync wirelessly with Apple's iPhone to provide a second screen for users to read messages from and input data to their mobiles

The patent application has emerged after a tidal wave of speculation suggesting how the iWatch could look.

Apple has not made a single comment about the rumoured new product, but designers have nevertheless rushed revealed their take the 'smart watch' with professional looking mockups of the device, ranging from a glass cuff to a 'claw' design.

The rumours started when Chinese websites reported in December that the computer giant is working with chip-maker Intel on a wrist-worn gadget.

It is was claimed it would have a 1.5in screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, which could include an iPhone.

Yrving Torrealba's translucent concept of how the iWatch might look has proved to be misguided, if Apple does indeed base their gadget on the technology in their latest patent application

The emergence of the '44215 patent app today appeared to back up some of those claims.

'Active communication between an accessory and a portable electronic device can be accomplished wirelessly,' it says. 'A wireless data connection such as the 5 GHz 802.11n protocol can provide sufficient data transmission bandwidth to transmit a high quality video stream.'

Alternatively, 'the accessory device could also connect to the portable electronic device via Bluetooth.

'While it might not carry the same amount of data it may be preferable for situations in which only small amounts of data are being sent back and forth.'

Apple has a team of about 100 product designers working on the wristwatch-type device, a report in Bloomberg claimed.
