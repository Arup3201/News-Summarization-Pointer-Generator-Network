A couple who were told four years ago there was no way they could have a child naturally have celebrated the birth of their 'miracle baby boy.'

ME sufferer Helen Laurence was told that she and husband Andi would not be able to conceive because they were both beset with a range of fertility problems.

But after years of trying, one round of unsuccessful IVF, and what they thought would be endless heartache, the couple from York, have welcomed 6lbs 15oz baby Murphy into their world after a surprise pregnancy.

ME sufferer Helen Laurence was told that she and husband Andi would not be able to conceive because they both had fertility problems, But now they have welcomed little baby Murphy

After seven years of trying, one round of unsuccessful IVF, and years of heartbreak, the couple are delighted to have conceived naturally

About a year after they started trying for a child, Mrs Laurence, 32, developed pains in her stomach and a doctor diagnosed her with endometriosis.

Endometriosis means that cells which normally line the womb are found elsewhere in the body, such as the outside of the fallopian tubes, the ovaries and the bladder, and it can cause infertility.

She also suffers with ME, or chronic fatigue syndrome, leaving her too tired to complete even simple tasks.

After
this news, the couple were sent for fertility checks and devastatingly 
found out that as well as Helen’s conditions of endometriosis and ME, Andi also had low sperm count with a low motility, or quality.

Mrs Laurence, 32, said doctors had broken the devastating news to her and her husband 37,  that they were infertile on Valentine’s Day 2008.

She said: 'It was an ironic day to find that out,' admitted Helen, 'and it felt like the worst day in the world.'

After one unsuccessful cycle of IVF, paid for by the NHS in 2011, the couple said they finally accepted defeat, after being left with only the costly option of private treatment, which at around £4,500 they simply could not afford.

Mrs Laurence said:  'Andi decided to concentrate on work so we could try and save for IVF and I bought a car I had always wanted - a Ford Puma.

'But
then I started getting symptoms. We’d had a lot of false alarms taking 
pregnancy tests so when we’d been out to buy the pregnancy test I think 
Andi was bracing himself for more disappointment.

'When I took the test, I just couldn’t believe it.'

With Helen's conditions of endometriosis and ME, or chronic fatigue syndrome, and Andi's low sperm count the couple were told their only option was IVF

The couple had given up hope of having a child after seven years of trying, when Mrs Laurence discovered she was pregnant with Murphy, now just three weeks old

Mr Laurence added: 'I was downstairs, ready with a box of tissues for tears. When 
she told me the result was positive, I have never run up the stairs so 
fast.'

The proud parents have now welcomed 6lbs 15oz baby Murphy into their world

Mum Helen described how she realised how her dreams had come true when she arrived home with the new baby after a difficult 36 hour labour.

She said: 'It hit me after we got home and he was asleep.

'I sat down on the edge of the bed and started crying, and said: ‘You’re so cute!’

'I was crying but it was happy tears. I couldn’t believe that my body, which wouldn’t work for me, had created something so perfect.'

Andi described how he too had had tears streaming down his face. 'I was chuffed to bits. We are still on cloud nine.'

Helen, who was diagnosed with ME in 2007 but had suffered with the symptoms since she was a child, explained that her condition leaves her very tired and run down - which made it harder for her to conceive.

'I get very tired and ill often, so the symptoms put strain on your body so it won’t conceive.'

In a strange turn of events, Helen added that when the doctor arrived to assist in the final stages of the delivery at York Hospital, she was staggered to recognise him from her time undergoing IVF treatment at Seacroft Hospital, Leeds, West Yorkshire.

She revealed he was the medic who had been involved in harvesting her eggs, who it turned out had subsequently moved to York Hospital.

'He was quite taken aback,' she said. 'He had been there at the start of it all and he was there at the end.'
