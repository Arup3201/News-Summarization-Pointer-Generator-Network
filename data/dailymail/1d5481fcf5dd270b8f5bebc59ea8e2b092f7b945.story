'Death wish': Paul Gascoigne, pictured during an event in Northampton on January 31, was rushed to intensive care when he arrived in America for rehabilitation

Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne has been rushed to intensive care, just before he was due to start treatment for alcohol addiction.

The 45-year-old was too unwell to receive medical care at the American rehab centre he was booked into, raising fears for his life.

Gascoigne was seriously ill last night, but was said to be out of immediate danger - and a former team-mate said he was 'recovering'.

Gary Lineker had said that his friend is 'struggling'. The Match of the Day presenter wrote on Twitter last night: 'Gazza is struggling, Let's hope he can hang on in there.'

Another former team-mate, one-time Tottenham captain Gary Mabbutt told Sky Sports News today: 'Unfortunately over the last few weeks Paul has had a relapse, which culminated finally, last Monday, in Paul asking for help.

'By Monday afternoon he was on a plane out to Arizona to a clinic specialising in dealing with Paul's specific problems.

'The first thing he underwent was a detox, unfortunately Paul had a very bad reaction to the detox and the clinic decided that as a precaution it was best to transfer him to hospital.

'He was transferred to hospital in intensive care where they could monitor him 24-7. But I spoke to Paul's medical team in the UK this morning, they had spoken to Paul and he's recovering and hopefully soon he will be back into the clinic to continue his rehab.

'Over the years he has had a lot of support from the football family, but of course it could be a long road to recovery. Now Paul's asked for the help we can focus on getting through this.'

Unwell: Gascoigne in Bournemouth shortly before a group of friends paid for him to receive treatment for his alcoholism at a clinic in Tucson, Arizona

The star flew to the U.S. 
last week where he was due to be treated at a rehabilitation clinic in 
Tucson, Arizona. Instead, he was taken to a nearby hospital where he has
spent the past four days.

According
to sources, his condition has stabilised, although it is not clear when
he will be well enough to attend his rehab course.

A
group of celebrity friends – including Chris Evans, Gary Lineker and 
Piers Morgan – had paid for Gascoigne to attend the clinic, which costs 
about £30,000 for an eight-week stay.

Since
then a number of England players, among them Wayne Rooney, have stepped
forward with offers of funds. Comedian James Corden has also donated 
money.

Gascoigne 
‘willingly’ flew to the States for help days after a video emerged of 
him sobbing on stage in front of a room full of fans.

Concern: Gary Lineker, who has helped fund Gascoigne's treatment in the US, last said that his former teammate was 'struggling'

But when he landed in Arizona he was pictured drinking a pint  at the airport bar, before a friend took it off him.

The Cottonwood Clinic, which boasts a team of ‘highly trained clinicians’, has ‘been effective for him previously’, his management company said.

Gascoigne has previously received help at
The Providence Projects rehabilitation centre in Dorset, whose 
treatment director Paul Spanjar was instrumental  in sending him to the 
US.

Mr Spanjar called at the former footballer’s home last week after the video became public – and found him ‘in terrible shape’ at 9.30am.

He said: ‘He was certainly under the influence. Physically he had really deteriorated.’

He added that Gascoigne had fallen off the wagon over the past six weeks, saying: ‘At times myself or a colleague would go round to check that he was still alive.

It seemed as though he had a death wish.’

Gascoigne made 57 appearances for  his country.

England manager Roy Hodgson said his captain, Steven Gerrard, has gone to the FA and ‘told them the players would like to contribute’.

He added: ‘Many of them looked up to him as the star player of the day, and I can only back that up.’

In his Mail on Sunday Live magazine column today, Chris Evans writes: ‘When I saw the pictures of my old pal last week at a so-called personal appearance, even I was shocked.

‘I say even I, because I’ve seen him bad before; much worse than you might imagine.

'Paul has been on the edge for well over a decade now, although admittedly never closer than of late.’
