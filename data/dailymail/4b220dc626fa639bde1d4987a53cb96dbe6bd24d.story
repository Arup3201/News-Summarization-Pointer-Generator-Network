A British snowboarder and Olympic coach who 'desperately wanted a girlfriend' was found hanged at his  family's country mansion.

Nelson Pratt, known by friends as Nelly, was discovered by his father Nigel in a garage on the £1.5million farm in Hampshire. An inquest into his death began yesterday.

The talented 33-year-old, who came second in this year's British championships, was described by his peers as a 'legendary' sportsman and one of the 'most talented' snowboarders in the UK.

Mr Pratt, pictured snowboarding in Andorra, was 33. The circumstances surrounding his death are unknown

The inquest was told Mr Pratt - known 
as 'Nelly' among friends - was found by his father. The hearing was 
adjourned to a date to be fixed.

Mr Pratt's distraught mother Edith said: 'I just cannot talk about it at the moment.'

The circumstances surrounding Mr Pratt's death are not yet known.

The
world of snowboarding was in shock as news of the star's death spread. 
Friends paid tribute to an 'incredibly popular' snowboarder.

Friend
Stu Bass - who organised the British Snowboard Championships this year 
and has known Nelson for nearly 20 years - said: 'Everybody is gutted at
this death. He was incredibly popular. Everybody is shocked.

'He was a true gentleman. He was amazingly talented. He came second this year in the British Championship.

'He was a coach to the Great Britain team and the army snowboard team.'

Mr Pratt was one of the most accomplished snowboarders in the country, who had appeared in a large number of magazines and videos.

The high-adrenaline stunts saw him fly up to 50ft of enormous snow ramps.

But friends stunned by the tragic news that Mr Pratt appeared to have taken his own life.

Mr
Pratt's best friend Marcus Chapman said: 'He was universally loved and 
will be sorely missed by anyone that knew him. Nelson was a hero to many
and an inspiration to us all.'

Friend Jamie Nicholls wrote on

have ever got. A man who was loved by everyone, was the nicest person 
you would ever meet. I have so many good memories and I'll never forget 
them on and off the hill!

'A
great coach and was looking forward to spending all this season with 
him. Gutted! He was a true gent! Love you and RIP Nelson! Xxxxxxx'

Aimee
Fuller added: 'Words can't express my thoughts right now to this tragic
news... A man I looked up to, aspired to be like, gentle, kind, and 
handsome.

'He taught me so much on and off the mountain and I am honoured
to have been a friend, a team mate and then coached by you Nelson.

'The
legacy of all things "executive" will live on... we will all miss you 
so much and will strive to make you proud. RIP Nelson Pratt xxx'

Fellow 
snowboarded Richard Bennett said: 'Devastatingly tragic news. He will be
missed enormously by us all. Always charming and keen to please, and so
modest given his legendary talent. He was one of life's true stars. 
Nelly we salute you.'

While
James Thorne wrote: 'Never once had a negative thing to say, the nicest
person I've had the privilege to call my friend. A man of the earth. A 
life we would all be proud to have followed.'

The
snowboarder coached the Team GB snowboarded team and the army snowboard
squad. He won silver this year at the slope-style championships, in 
addiction to a string of tough competitions in the past.

Mr Pratt was a regular feature in snowboarding magazines, famed for his extreme stunts across mountains.

A
famous family business called Pratts, run by Nelson's relative Chris, 
that sells special rapeseed oil is based at the sprawling home.

Tony
Seddon, chairman of Grateley Parish council, said: 'It's very sad news 
indeed for all concerned. I am shocked to hear the news. It is very sad 
and traumatic for the family.'

Hampshire Police said today: 'There are no suspicious circumstances.'
