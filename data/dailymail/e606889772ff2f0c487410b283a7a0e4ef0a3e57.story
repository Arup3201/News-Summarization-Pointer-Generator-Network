A California designer has filed a copyright infringement suit claiming he's been cheated out of credit and payment for posters he designed for the Spike Lee film 'Oldboy.'

This Tuesday, Juan Luis Garcia filed suit in California federal court court claiming he offered Lee and his Forty Acres and a Mule Filmworks production company 'accesss to the the posters, and offered 
Defendants the opportunity to use them to market their film, with the 
condition precedent that they pay Plaintiff for such use. Defendants 
never paid Plaintiff.'

Released in
 November, the remake of the South Korean cult classic was a box office 
bomb and grossed less than $5 million worldwide.

Juan Luis Garcia filed suit claiming he offered Spike Lee and his work for Oldboy movie posters but that he wasn't compensated

Oldboy was one of the worst performing film's of Spike Lee's career, bringing in less than $5 million worldwide

Garcia claims to have designed posters for films including 'The Great Gatsby,' '12 Years a Slave,' 'Lincoln,' '42,' and 'Jobs.'

His lawsuit notes that the posters were released with tags ';© 2013 Spike Lee,'; and ';© 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks.'

'This copyright attribution is false, as Plaintiff owns these 
posters, not anyone else, and the images were not owned or under license
 to Defendants,' the complaint reads. 'Moreover, Defendants knew this was false at the time these posters 
were created, but continued to reproduce and distribute this false 
information.'

Beyond copyright infringement, Garcia claims a violation under 17 U.S.C. 1202, which is regarding alleged alteration of copyright management information.

Lee claims he never heard of Garcia or agreed to any deal for his work

He wrote an open letter to Lee at the time of the film's release saying he had worked exclusively on the posters for two months only to be offered an extremely low fee from the ad agency, which he then declined.

Lee responded to the letter on Twitter: 'I Never Heard Of This Guy Juan Luis Garcia,If He Has A Beef It's Not 
With Me.I Did Not Hire Him,Do Not Know Him.Cheap Trick Writing To 
Me.YO.'

The Hollywood Reporter noted that a man on Instagram questioned Lee saying, 'Dude pay the 
graphic artist.'

Lee responded: 'Why Should I Pay Someone Who I 
Never Met Nor Had Any Contact With Ever? He Never Made Any Deal With 
Me.Why Don't You Pay Me For Your Stupid Text On Thanksgiving Day?'

Lee has yet to respond to requests for comment.
