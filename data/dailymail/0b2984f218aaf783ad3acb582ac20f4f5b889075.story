The female half of a duo accused of being the 'new Bonnie and Clyde' after a bloody 330-mile crime spree claims she was the victim of a meth-addled 'evil person' who was planning to kill her.

Far from being his willing accomplice, Angela Hill says she was kidnapped - 'in a way' - by Logan McFarland and dragged on a trip that ended after a high-speed chase on the interstate.

Authorities aren't buying the sob story and have charged Hill, 25 - also known as Angela Attwood - with attempted murder.

They allege she shot Rattana Keomanivong in the back of the head during a botched carjacking in West Wendover, Nevada.

In a jailhouse interview with the Salt
Lake Tribune, Hill sobbed as she said she didn't belong behind bars.

However, she would not explain exactly how she was innocent of the 
crimes when Ms Keomanjvong reported her as the one who tried to rob her 
at gunpoint.

'This is not Bonnie and Clyde,' Hill said.

'People are making me out to be an animal, and I’m not.'

Instead,
Hill blamed the deadly cross-country rampage on McFarland, a high 
school friend, who she says beat her and threatened to kill her.

She says he took methamphetamine as the two drove across three towns and evaded police for five days.

Hill showed the Salt Lake Tribune reporter broken teeth she says are the result of being punched in the mouth by McFarland. 

'He’s evil. He’s an evil person,' she said.

She says she went to visit McFarland on December 31 with a friend, even though she hadn't seen the man in years.

One day earlier, police say McFarland broke into the home of Leroy and Dorotha Ann Fullwood, ages 70 and 69, in Mount Pleasant, Utah, and shot them both in the head during a robbery.

He has been charged with the elderly couple's murder.

According to her story, Hill was not with McFarland during the bloody shootings.

After she met McFarland, the pair drove to West Wendover, Nevada, and ambushed Ms Keomanivong in the parking lot of a casino. Both of them were armed, Ms Keomanivong told the High Desert Advocate.

The victim told police Hill forced her into her own car and told her to drive. McFarland followed in a car he had allegedly stolen on December 29.

Ms Keomanivong eventually fought back, biting Hill in the ear and the neck and forcing her out of the car.

The gym owner, who was named West Wendover's strongest woman last year, was shot in the back of the head while fleeing.

Police say Hill fired the shot, but she told the Tribune: 'I was not the shooter.'

The pair were arrested January 4 on a ranch after being spotted by a plane circling overhead.

'I was the one who waved to the plane,' she said.

'I was so glad when the police came, because I probably would have been dead too.'
