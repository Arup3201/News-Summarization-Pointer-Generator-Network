'To be able to make a little gesture like that tonight, knowing that they were keen Fremantle fans and members… it's the littlest thing we could do, to run out and (pay) tribute to them in that way.'

Pavlich had told Game Day he was struggling to comprehend the disaster.

'It really just ... puts perspective on life, on footy and how quickly it can be taken away,' he said. 'It’s really emotional, given they were young Fremantle supporters as well.'

On Sunday, Scotch College, where Mo was a year seven student, will hold a service of celebration and thanksgiving for family and friends of the Maslins and the Norrises.

Mo's Scarborough Junior Football Club teammates held a minute's silence to remember their friend following the disaster on Sunday, July 20.
