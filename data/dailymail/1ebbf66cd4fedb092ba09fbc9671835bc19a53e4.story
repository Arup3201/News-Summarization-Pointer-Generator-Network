A poignant image has emerged from protests over a deadly police shooting in Phoenix, as police Tuesday released the name of the officer who shot and killed an unarmed drug suspect.

The 9-year-old daughter of Rumain Brisbon, Aiyana Rains, was among those attending a demonstration Monday in downtown Phoenix as protesters pushed for greater transparency in the investigation.

The Arizona Republic reports a police officer in riot gear shook the girl's hand and said 'I'm sorry.' The newspaper also captured an image of the encounter.

Encounter: A police officer in riot gear was snapped meeting Aiyana Rains, daughter of Rumain Brisbon, and reportedly told her 'I'm sorry' at the Monday protest 

Shooting: Police have said  Rumain Brisbon was unarmed when he was shot by a white officer investigating a tip that Brisbon was doing a drug deal inside an SUV in the parking lot of his apartment complex

When asked about the gesture, the attorney for Brisbon's family, Marci Kratter, said it was 'nice, but it does not bring back her father.' She says, 'It doesn't change things.'

Police were investigating complaints of drug dealing in a Phoenix neighborhood when officer Mark Rine shot Brisbon.

The officer mistook a pill bottle in the suspect's pocket for a gun as the two scuffled.

The move to name Rine came Tuesday just hours before activists and Brisbon's family members planned a protest.

Rine, a seven-year veteran of the department, has been reassigned to nonenforcement duty pending the outcome of an internal investigation, police said.

'It has been seven days since the incident and we didn't want to hold off on releasing the name any longer,' Phoenix Police Department spokesman Sgt. Trent Crump told Reuters on Tuesday. 'He's now had time to mitigate any threats he might receive.' 

Prosecutors will determine whether the 30-year-old officer will face criminal charges in the December 2 shooting.

Incident: Brisbon failed to obey the officer's commands and ran to an apartment where a struggle turned deadly, police said, noting that the officer mistook a pill bottle that Brisbon had been clutching in his pocket for the butt of a gun

Police Chief Daniel Garcia told AZCentral.com 'The conclusion I came to is, it's time now. It's time to release the name. One of the things that I've tried to do from the onset of this incident was to be transparent. We're not Ferguson.'

'We're a city who has many communication avenues available to our community,' he also told the news outlet. 'We take pride in the fact that we have a relationship with all segments to our community, and I thought it was important for us to be as transparent as possible from the very onset.'

Police have said 34-year-old Brisbon, who was black, was unarmed when he was shot by a white officer investigating a tip that Brisbon was doing a drug deal inside an SUV in the parking lot of his apartment complex.

Brisbon failed to obey the officer's commands and ran to an apartment where a struggle turned deadly, police said, noting that the officer mistook a pill bottle that Brisbon had been clutching in his pocket for the butt of a gun.

'Unfortunately because this individual is a police officer and is engaged in the line of work that he is, he and his family are now going to be put under undue stress and concern for their safety,' Phoenix Law Enforcement Association President Joe Clure told ABC15. 

An autopsy has determined that Brisbon died from gunshot wounds to his torso.

The Rev. Jarrett Maupin, a civil rights advocate, said he and friends and family members of Brisbon were planning to rally and march in downtown Phoenix unless police released the name of the officer involved.

A call to Maupin on Tuesday from The Associated Press wasn't immediately returned. 

Daughter: Aiyana Rains is seen crying Monday night during the protest 

Demonstration: Protesters are seen in Phoenix on Monday night in the wake of the shooting 

Authorities: Police were in riot gear Monday night during as the demonstrators walked through Phoenix
