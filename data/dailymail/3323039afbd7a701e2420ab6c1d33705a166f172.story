Guilty: Karl Karlsen is shown pleaded guilty to second-degree murder for crushing his son under a truck in 2008 in a life insurance scheme that netted him $700,000

A man has admitted killing his son in an insurance scam that gained him $700,000.

Authorities say Karl Karlsen, from upstate New York, confessed to the crime.

Seneca County District Attorney Barry Porsch said 53-year-old Karlsen's guilty plea to second-degree murder came as a surprise a day before his trial was set to open.

Karlsen was charged with murder and insurance fraud after the death of his son Levi.

Prosecutors say Karlsen killed the 23-year-old on November 20, 2008 by toppling a truck on him as he worked underneath at his father's home in Yale Farm Road.

His death was initially ruled an 
accident, but Karlsen collected a $700,000 life insurance payout after 
the incident, raising suspicions.

A family member tipped off the police about the large insurance policy and opened an investigation into his death last year

Karlsen was sole beneficiary of Levi's insurance policy. 

Investigators have also been reviewing the 1991 death of Karlsen's former wife, Christina Karlsen. She died in a Calaveras County, California, fire that also resulted in an insurance payout. Karlsen has denied causing her death.

Karlsen has not been charged in relation to anything related to his wife's death.

His daughter, Erin Deroche, spoke to ABC News last month saying she has no doubts that her father is guilty of killing her brother and their mother as well.

It
wasn't until Deroche and her brother Levi were 11 or 12 when she said 
they secretly discussed the possibility that their father wasn't being 
truthful regarding their mother's death.

Tragic loss: After ten hours interrogation by police, he finally admitted he had been there when the truck fell on his son Levi and had accidentally caused it to happen, before leaving him to die

‘Between
the two of us...we knew, because he didn't try,’ Deroche said. ‘He 
didn't make an effort to save her. He just stood there,’ she told ABC 
News.

However, when she 
and Levi confronted their father, Deroche said, ‘his biggest concern was
that he wondered what the community would think of his own children 
accusing him of murdering their mother.’

The Democrat and Chronicle says in media interviews Karlsen said his ex-wife's death, his son's death and a 2002 fire at his Seneca County farm that killed his Belgian draft horses, for which he collected $80,000 in insurance money, were all just coincidences.

Karl Karlsen is due to be sentenced by Judge Dennis Bender on December 16.

The sentence he is likely to face hasn't been released.
