Friends have detailed the distressing events that lead to the suspected overdose of a 19-year-old woman at a dance music festival at the weekend.

Georgina Bartter, 19, was at Harbourlife festival at Mrs Macquarie's Chair near the Sydney Botanical Gardens on Saturday when she collapsed on the dancefloor.

A close friend of Ms Bartter, who spent most of the day before and during the festival with her told Daily Mail Australia they first noticed something was wrong when she started shivering uncontrollably at around 4pm.

Georgina Bartter, 19, died of a suspected drug overdose at Harbourlife festival in Sydney on Saturday

'She seemed fine for a while and then she started shivering as if she was getting cold', the friend revealed.

'She started going downhill from there.'

Despite friends giving her water and trying to warm her up, Ms Bartter continued to deteriorate.

'I was with her for a while, just me and her, and I was there trying to give her a hug and keep her warm', the friend said.

As she got worse another friend and his girlfriend were caring for the teenager from Longueville in Sydney's lower north shore before she started convulsing around 4.40pm.

The same pair then travelled in an ambulance to hospital with Ms Bartter, where she died later that night. 

'It's been pretty tough for all of us,' the friend said, describing Ms Bartter as a 'bubbly' and 'friendly' girl.

The family of the teenager - whose friends said she only took 'one and a half' pills - released a statement on Sunday remembering her as a 'beautiful young woman'.

Friends said the teenager had taken one and a half pills before she collapsed

The head of St Vincent's Hospital's Emergency department, Dr Gordion Fulde told Triple M that everything was done to save the economics student, who was in a critical condition when she arrived at the hospital.

'It was quickly evident the only chance of survival was to put her on a heart lung machine. This equipment mechanically gives her blood flow and oxygen,' said Dr Fulde.

'The cardiothoracic surgeon and operation theatre staff and the hi-tech machine were brought.'

'Despite care only available in a few hospitals worldwide a lovely girl died.'

Dr Fulde says the team at St Vincent's Hospital remain devastated after witnessing the family's intense grief.

'The grief and devastation of the family, of the mother was indescribable.'

The statement also remembered her as 'vibrant' and said the teenager's behaviour was out of character, Nine News reported.

'She was a beautiful and vibrant young woman, who was much loved and will be sadly missed, the statement read.

'She had allergies, and it was extremely out of character.' 

The family reportedly said, 'Georgina was allergic to drugs and never would have knowingly taken them', according to Channel Seven. 

An autopsy will be carried out to determine what was in the pill that contributed to her death.

Officers were alerted to the unconscious 19-year-old woman as they carried out a drug operation at the event.

The teen from Longueville on Sydney's north shore was taken to St Vincent's Hospital, suffered multiple organ failure and died. 

Witnesses recall seeing Ms Bartter 'collapse' in the middle of the dance floor and begin frothing at the mouth.

'She was dancing next to us when she collapsed on the dance floor. I thought she was pretty hammered but then she just dropped to the floor,' one witness told Daily Mail Australia.

'It was shocking, you just don’t know what to do. We were all waving our arms around for a paramedic.'

The three witnesses were distressed to learn that the young woman had died, but say that night they knew something was drastically wrong. 

'Medics were trying to resuscitate her and she was frothing at the mouth,' the witnesses, who wished not to be named, explained.

'When she got carried out she wasn't well. Her eyes were in the back of her head and her friends were freaking out.'

Two of the witnesses explain that it was 'wild' and claim they saw four people taken to hospital due to what they assume were drug-related incidents. 

'She was the worst but we saw three other people taken out by ambulances.'

'I actually wondered this morning if anyone had died cos I saw that many people overdose and in a bit of a state. It was that wild.' 

NSW Ambulance service confirm that four people were treated from Mrs Macquarie's Chair.

Two people were taken to hospital by ambulance, including Ms Bartter. The second case was an alleged assault.

Two suspected drug-related cases were treated at the scene.

Another witness recalls seeing the girl become ‘drowsy’ and ‘shaking’ before she collapsed.

‘Not long after she collapsed the medics were with her. She was shaking non-stop for a bit while on the ground. Very sad sight. Condolences to her family.’ 

Officers, meanwhile, arrested 78 people at the event for drug offences.

Inspector Stewart Leggat of City Central Local Area Command asked for anyone with knowledge about synthetic substance sellers to come forward.

'The information you provide could save someone's life.'

Insp Leggat warned about the dangers of taking illegal drugs, emphasising there was no quality control in their production.

'Quite simply, you don't know what you are getting - seeking a synthetic high, could result in a serious injury or death,' he said.

'If you know of a business or person who may be involved in the sale of illegal synthetic substances, please contact Crime Stoppers immediately. We don't need to know who you are, all we need is the information you have. 

Witnesses said they saw at least four people taken to hospital one the same day, from suspected drug-related incidents

'The information you provide could save someone's life.'

The organisers of Harbourlife, Fuzzy Events, have extended their sincere condolences to the young woman's loved ones and assure the public patron safety is a priority.

'Right now our thoughts are with her family – we can hardly imagine the pain and heartbreak they must be feeling, and they have our deepest sympathy,' the statement read.

'Harbourlife has been held annually since 2003. It has a fully equipped first aid tent with an emergency doctor, 2 paramedics, 3 first responder medics, 2 supervisors and a communications officer.' 

The 19-year-old was treated by paramedics at the scene and transported to St Vincents hospital, Darlinghurst where she died
