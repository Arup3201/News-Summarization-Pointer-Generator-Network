Liverpool midfielder Lucas Leiva admits it would be a 'dream' to return to Wembley this season, though he has had thoughts about leaving the club.

The Brazilian midfielder was a target of Inter Milan this January, although no official bid materialised.

Brendan Rodgers, having restored Lucas to the team after a spell on the sidelines, maintained he did not want to lose a player who, in his youth, won the Bola de Ouro, Brazil’s Player of the Year award.

That did not stop Lucas thinking of a move elsewhere, though.

‘I just have to focus on what I can control and see what happens,’ he said. ‘I would be lying if I said I never thought about something new but I can’t tell you what is going to happen. I just focus on the day and leave the future to take care of itself.’

Standing in Lucas' and Liverpool's way on Tuesday night are Chelsea, who are the favourites to progress to the Capital One Cup final after the 1-1 draw in the first leg at Anfield.

He added: ‘Of course Chelsea will always be in the way of what we want to achieve because they are a big club.

‘They are the same as Manchester United, Arsenal and Manchester City. When you get towards finals, you have to play them. Hopefully this time it will go our way.’

The focus on Tuesday is helping Liverpool reach their 12th League Cup final. Although injured, he was in the party that travelled for the 11th, which ended with a penalty shootout victory over Cardiff City in February 2012, but felt on the periphery of the celebrations. This time he wants to experience it for real. 

‘It was hard for me,’ said Lucas. ‘When we were on our way to the stadium of course I was a bit down because I wanted to be part of it on the pitch and I remember Stevie Gerrard sending me a text which said, “Don’t worry, we will get here again”. 

'It is something I always remember and hopefully we will make that come true. That would be special.’
