A 12-foot python was found just feet
away from a busy Burger King drive-thru restaurant on Route 20 in Paterson, New
Jersey on Tuesday.

The slippery customer was spotted by a
construction crew fixing a sewer line in grass near the Passaic River at around
10:30 a.m. The workers called Paterson Animal Control who managed to captured the
python with special tongs.

Paterson Animal Control officer Angel Rivera says the snake was probably a
pet that had been dumped there a couple of days before by an owner didn't want to take care of it anymore.

Animal control turned the snake over to retired biology teacher Gerald
Zelenka, who operates ‘In Touch with Nature,’ a local company that offers live
animal shows to schools, nursing homes, and charity groups.

‘It has the potential of giving a
good bite. Imagine if there was a youngster,’
Zelenka told ABC7. He was bitten by the snake as he moved it to the ‘In Touch with Nature’
facility.

He agrees with Paterson animal control officers, saying the snake is in good
health and was probably dumped here by someone who didn't want to take care of
the creature anymore.

‘That's the problem, people have a pet and they don't want it and they don't
realize that's the end of the snake,’ he said.

In another month, the cold weather would have killed the creature. If caught, the snakes' owner face a $1,000 fine and up to six months in jail for animal cruelty.
