Furious visitors to the new  £27million Stonehenge visitor centre have criticised English Heritage for ‘chaotic scenes’ as the site struggles to cope with the crowds.

Tourists have slammed the centre – which opened three weeks ago – on travel website TripAdvisor, with positive reviews plummeting by almost half. Most of the criticism centred on the transportation from the centre to the stones.

Visitors have moaned about queuing for more than an hour to board a ‘land train’ – three carriages pulled by a Land Rover – which carries 45 people and takes ten minutes to travel to the stones.

Complaints: Ratings on TripAdvisor have plummeted in the three weeks since the visitor centre opened

With just two land trains operating, 
English Heritage has been forced to put on extra regular coaches, hired 
from local bus companies, to deal with numbers.

Visitors say the system is a ‘farce’ and have asked how the centre will cope when thousands a day visit during the summer.

One
 reviewer, Paco G, from Spain, said: ‘There are two Land Rovers towing 
some wagons and some mini-buses that mysteriously are stopped half of 
the time.

‘People were getting angry after one and a half hours of queuing.’

Others
 told English Heritage to ‘learn from Disney’ on how to manage crowds, 
while more slated the price rise for adult tickets from £8 to £14.95.

One
 volunteer, who declined to be named, added: ‘When it’s windy or 
raining, those in the ticket office can’t open the windows to serve 
people because the rain blows in – it’s been built facing the wrong 
direction.’

English Heritage asked tourists to be patient while it solved the problems.

Previously, Stonehenge enjoyed four- or five-star reviews from 75 per cent of visitors on ratings website TripAdvisor, despite politicians branding the 1960s visitors centre 'a national
 disgrace'.

But in just 21 days, positive reviews have plummeted to 46 per cent.

Negative reviews, giving the site a one-star rating, have jumped from eight per cent to a third.

Delays: Visitors waited for an hour-and-a-half for a shuttle bus to take 45 people at a time to the stones

Even those giving Stonehenge a good overall score complaining of the chaos surrounding accessing the stones.

A section of the A344 road, which runs past Stonehenge, was permanently closed in June during the construction of the visitor building.

The centre, designed by architects Denton Corker Marshall, lies a mile-and-a-half to the west of the stones.

English Heritage has admitted there have been 'some issues' and asked tourists to be patient while they solve the problems.

One reviewer, ‘Paco G’, from Spain, said: 'There are two Land Rovers towing some wagons and some mini-buses that mysteriously are stopped half of the time.

'People were getting angry after one and a half hours of queuing.'

Others told English Heritage to ‘learn from Disney’ on how to manage crowds, while more slated the price rise for tickets from around £8 to £14.95 for an adult.

Conflict: The centre had already come under fire from New Age Tribes for exhibiting the skeleton of a Neolithic man rather than burying him

Staff and volunteers have also spoken of their frustrations at the new system. One volunteer, who declined to be named, said it was immediately obvious the centre would not be able to cope with the numbers of people visiting.

He said: 'The problem is the transport, getting people to and from the stones.

'They have abandoned the idea of only using the Land Trains, we’ve got coaches now, which kind of defeats the object.

'Also, when it’s windy or raining, those in the ticket office can’t open the windows to serve people because the rain blows in, it’s been built facing the wrong direction.'

Kate Davies, Stonehenge’s general manager, yesterday played down the fiercely negative reviews of the new centre, and asked people to be patient.

She said: 'There has been huge interest in Stonehenge since the new visitor centre opened towards the end of December.

'On one day alone we welcomed 5,000 visitors which is along the same levels as during our peak summer season.

'This is a brand new operation, on a completely different scale to the old visitor centre, and naturally during these early days, there have been some issues.

'But we are solving them, we have increased our shuttle service taking people to the stones and from 1 February, our timed ticketing system will swing into place.

'The majority of feedback has been overwhelmingly positive; visitors have been fascinated by our new exhibition and love the sense that the stones are now reconnected with the wider landscape.

'We appreciate all the feedback we’ve received and we would ask people to be patient while we iron out the few remaining issues.'
