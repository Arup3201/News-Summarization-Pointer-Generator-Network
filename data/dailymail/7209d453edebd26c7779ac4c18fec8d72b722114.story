A self-confessed ‘psycho,’ who attacked his ex-partner with a meat cleaver and a boat flare before drugging his baby daughter with heroin, has been jailed for 18 years.

Gillian Blackmore, 28, had to run for her life, naked and soaked in blood, as her ex-partner Roger Weir unleashed his attack.

The 45-year-old beat his former fiancee repeatedly with a metal baton, shooting her with a boat flare and slashing her neck with a meat cleaver at her flat in Eastleigh, Southampton.

Weir turned violent when he found out that Miss Blackmore had found a new man after they split up and he did not want her new partner raising his 20-month-old child.

After telling Miss Blackmore ‘I want you dead’ and firing at her with an adapted flare gun, he threatened to kill their daughter by feeding her heroin.

Sentencing an emotionless Weir today at Winchester Crown Court, Judge Keith Cutler said the attack had a severe psychological impact on Miss Blackmore, who had thought she and her baby were going to die.

Describing himself as ‘a psycho that tried to kill his ex-wife’, Weir said he had ‘snapped’ and blamed voices in his head for his actions, the court heard.

Weir, frustrated by family court proceedings between the pair, had arrived at the flat with the baton and flare as ‘props’.

In his rage, he picked up the cleaver and struck Miss Blackmore with it at least twice.

Judge Cutler said: ‘When you fired the flare she thought “This is it” and felt she was going to die at your hands.

After split: Weir attacked Gillian Blackmore, 28, with a flare gun and slashed her neck with this meat cleaver. Judge Keith Cutler said: 'If the weapons had landed on her head instead, she would be dead'

‘Afterwards, with some courage, she tried to escape you and stop any further attack on her.

‘Not
only did Gillian feel she was going to be killed by you, but for quite 
some time she also feared for the life and the health of her child.’

Graphic photos showed three inch wounds Weir inflicted on Miss Blackmore’s neck, Judge Cutler said.

He said: ‘If the weapons had landed on her head instead, she would be dead.’

Weir had gone round to make his former partner ‘sit and listen to him’, but the situation escalated, the court heard.

Miss Blackmore, surrounded by family and friends in the packed public gallery, wept as the traumatic events were recounted.

Judge Cutler handed Weir 16 years for attempted murder and two years for administering a noxious substance to his child, to run consecutively.

Weir, who previously served in the Territorial Army, had pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing.

Nigel Pascoe QC, mitigating, said Weir had been suicidal in the wake of the relationship break up.

The dramatic events came to a head in a standoff with armed police, alerted by the young mother’s 999 call from outside her flat, to rescue the toddler from Weir’s clutches.

Weir, from Poole, Dorset, had locked himself and his daughter in her bedroom, the court heard.

Officers found the hallway full of smoke because Weir had let off the flare gun, which set the carpet alight.

He could be heard shouting: ‘Don’t come in here or I’ll shoot the baby.’

Eventually officers persuaded Weir to allow them to retrieve the baby, before armed police rushed in and found him on a sofa. He was holding a large kitchen knife to his neck and had already slashed his wrist.

As he was searched, he said: ‘I have given the baby heroin, I wanted her to die with me... I wanted her and me dead.’

Weir later told police he had squirted heroin into his daughter’s mouth with a syringe ‘to get at her mother’ but regretted it and stopped, the court heard.

Toxicology reports revealed there were only traces of the drug in her system.

The horrific ordeal began when Weir returned their daughter to her mother in the early hours as she wouldn’t settle at his home then refused to leave.

He showed Miss Blackmore a bullet and pulled a mini flare gun from his pocket, telling her that if he removed part of it, he could fire the bullet.

He added that he had come equipped with 7ounces of heroin and intended to kill their daughter as well.

Scared, she managed to ring 999 but discarded her phone when the attack intensified.

As he approached her with the gun and fired it, she thought she was going to be shot dead.

She described hearing a ‘pop’ and feeling something in her side.

Weir then used the baton, hitting her about four times on the back of her legs before ripping her dressing gown from her.

He struck her twice with the meat cleaver on the back of her neck before she managed to flee into the street.

Outside, Miss Blackmore’s new partner Barry Towler, an off-duty police community support officer, saw Miss Blackmore running towards him.

She was screaming and covered in blood, saying that Weir was going to kill her little girl.

Mr Towler tried to get into the flat but was stopped by police, who were already inside trying to rescue the child, the court was told.

Weir told the court today: ‘I wish to apologise unreservedly for my conduct to Gillian and our wonderful little daughter.

‘While there may be mitigation and explanation, I do not feel and would not argue that there was any justification for it, in part or in whole.’

Mr Pascoe said Weir was grateful to the surgeons who fought to save his right hand, after he severely damaged his tendons.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
