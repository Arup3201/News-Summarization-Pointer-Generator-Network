She's been branded the new darling of Russia, the Olga Korbut of Sochi 2014. And it hasn't gone unnoticed by her country's president Vladimir Putin.

Julia Lipnitskaia is just 15, but she has already taken her mother country by storm with her spellbinding performance yesterday in the Winter Olympics.

Just like the gymnast Korbut who won three golds for the USSR at Munich in 1972, Russia's new ice princess left the crowd gasping with a routine that secured Russia's first gold of the games as part of the team ice dance 
competition.

Wearing a red coat and skating to music from the movie Schindler's List, just like the girl in the red coat in the predominantly black-and-white film, she put on an incredible show at the Iceberg 
Skating Palace.

Julia's unparalleled artistry, flexibility and blurring spins mesmerised a partisan crowd that included Mr Putin.

When the music stopped, and she had landed the last of her 10 jumps, they were on their feet applauding, whistling, and chanting her name.

At six days younger than Tara Lipinski, the American who won at 15 in Nagano in 1998, Julia became the youngest athlete ever to win a gold medal at the Winter Olympics.

Next up, the teen, who hails from the Ural Mountains, will compete in the women's singles event, for which she is now the hot favourite but which no Russian has ever won.

Her country is holding its breath.

Speaking after the event, Julia said: 'I don't know how to explain the feeling I
 had out there. I'm very happy to have helped win the first
 gold medal for Russia.

'I got nervous in the middle of the program, I'm 
not sure why, it's completely unlike me, so the jumps weren't great in 
the second half, I didn't feel totally comfortable.

'The jumps didn't 
feel like mine at that point. I wouldn't say I got tired, but some 
errors still crept in. But even with some flaws it was OK.'

Yulia Lipnitskaya is set to have the biggest impact on an Olympics for Russia since the 'Little Sparrow,' 17 year-old Olga Korbut at the Munich Olympics in 1972

U.S. 
skater Ashley Wagner said: 'She was incredibly composed. You felt the audience when she stepped out on the
 ice, so for her to go out and put out such a solid performance at 15 is
 impressive.

'Granted, we've been backstage with her and she doesn't seem
 15 to us at all. She's like a wise 40-year-old woman trapped within a 
15-year-old's body.

'Honestly, it is very inspiring to see someone so 
young so composed.'

Canada won the team silver on Sunday, and the United States took bronze.

U.S. skater Gracie Gold, part of team that finished third, said: 'She's only 15. She's completely unfazed. She's got no spine, but she's got iron in her bones.'
