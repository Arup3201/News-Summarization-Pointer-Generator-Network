More than half of teenagers and people in their early 20s say they have been victims of some form of online bullying, taunts or harassment.

An MTV poll has discovered that 56 per cent have been targeted through various methods including a third who have fallen foul of 'sexting' - the sharing of risqué personal videos or images.

As many as 40 per cent have even faced some form of abuse from their partners on computers or with mobile phones.

Harassment: As young people spend more time on the internet, the number that report being bullied continues to rise

With more time being spent on the internet, there has been a significant increase in online bullying of 14 to 24-year-olds - a rise of 10 per cent in just two years.

In some of the most tragic cases, vicious taunts have led to suicides.

Yesterday New York Senator Jeffrey Klein introduced a new 'cyber-bullying' bill saying outdated pre-digital harassment laws fail to punish bullies who use the internet and mobile phones to torment others.

Tragic: Jamey Rodemeyer, 14, killed himself after falling victim to online bullies. A poll found 56 per cent of American youth had been taunted online

He argued that current state law had failed to keep up with modern technology and people spending more time online.

'If people know there is a tough law on the books and they're going to be punished, they are going to act accordingly,' he said.

At least 30 states have laws dealing with online harassment and five specifically for cyber-bullying.

Mr Klein's bill would mean that stalking laws would be updated to include harassing a child using electronic communication.

Although it is already a crime to 
'intentionally cause or aid' another person's suicide, the bill would 
update the state's second-degree manslaughter statute to explicitly 
include cyber-bullying as a possible cause of such a suicide.

At the weekend, Lady Gaga sang a tribute to 14-year-old Jamey Rodemeyer who apparently killed himself after sending her a thank-you message on Twitter.

He had suffered from homophobic online bullying for more than a year and wrote a blog about trouble he got at school.

Among the anonymous posting was one that said 'JAMIE IS STUPID, GAY FAT ANND UGLY. HE MUST DIE!'

Proportion of people who say they have been bullied online: 56%

Rise since 2009: 10%

Number who say the internet is a shield for bullies: 75%

Those aged 14-17 who have 'sexted': 8%

Those aged 18-24 who have sexted: 14%

Proportion who have been abused online by partner: 14%AP-MTV poll of 1,355 people aged 14-24

Police have launched an investigation to decide whether to bring charges and believe that three fellow students may have been involved.

While many forms of online bullying decline as teens go through school, homophobic abuse remains the same throughout.

Catherine Devine, 22, said that she 
became a victim of internet harassment when she was 12 and in 7th grade before she had even ventured onto the internet.

Somebody
 opened a screen name with the name 'devinegirl' and started sending 
rumours and lies about her to classmates. When she was 15 one 
'friend' sent her diary to other people.

When she was 18 she sent a revealing 
picture of herself to her boyfriend after he put pressure on her. However, 
when they broke up he threatened to use it to embarrass her.

'I
 didn't realise the power he could have over me from that,' she said. 'I
 thought he'd just see it once and then delete it, like I had deleted 
it.'

Three-quarters of 
young people believe that bullies use the internet because they 
are too cowardly to confront their victim face to face.

False
 rumours and sharing other people's private messages are among the more 
common forms of bullying while logging onto someone else's account and 
spying on them are also popular.

Nearly
 a fifth of young people said that someone else had posted embarrassing 
pictures or video of them online without their permission.

Risque: The number of incidents of 'sexting' - sending lewd images - has not increased thanks to high profile cases like that of former congressman, Anthony Weiner

Researchers have found that many of those who bully on the internet do the same in real life.

Sameer
 Hinduja, from Florida Atlantic University, said: 'We are seeing 
offenders who are just jerks to people online and offline.

'When
 I was bullied in middle school I could go home and slam my door and 
forget about it for a while. These kids can be accessed around the clock
 through technology. There's really no escape.'

Despite
 the significant rises in other forms of bullying, sexting has shown 
little increase. It is believed that this is because people are thinking
 twice about sending photographs of themselves.

A major deterrent has been high-profile cases including that of former Senator Anthony Wiener who stood down from Congress after posting a risqué picture of himself on Twitter.

Eight
 per cent of those aged 14 to 17 said they had shared a naked picture of 
themselves; among 18 to 24 years old, it was 14 per cent.

But almost a quarter of the younger group said they'd been exposed to sexting in 
some way, including seeing images someone else was showing around. And 
37 per cent of the young adults had some experience with 'sexting' 
images.

Many young people don't take sexting seriously, despite the potential consequences.

Alec Wilhelmi, 20, says girlfriends and girls who like him have sent sexual messages or pictures - usually photos of bare body parts that avoid showing faces.

Once a friend made a sexual video with his girlfriend, and showed Mr Wilhelmi on his mobile.

'I thought that was funny, because I don't know what kind of girl would allow that,' said Mr Wilhelmi, a freshman at Iowa State University.

Technology can facilitate dating abuse. Nearly three in 10 young people say their partner has checked up on them electronically multiple times a day or read their text messages without permission.

Fourteen per cent say they've experienced more abusive behaviour from their partners, such as name-calling and mean messages, via Internet or cellphone.

The poll is part of an MTV campaign, 'A Thin Line,' aiming to stop the spread of digital abuse.
