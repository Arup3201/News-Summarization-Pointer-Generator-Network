NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's tense press conference this afternoon was interrupted by a prankster who was dragged kicking and screaming from the room.

Benjy Bronk, a writer on The Howard Stern Show, was forcibly removed when he began screaming: 'What are you doing?' Don't take me to an elevator!'

Bronk, who has pulled pranks before, was referring to the video of NFL player Ray Rice attacking his then-fiancee in an Atlantic City elevator.

The identity of the heckler has not been revealed.  He was forcibly removed from the room by security

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell's tense press conference this afternoon was interrupted by a heckler who was dragged kicking and screaming from the room

Bronk entered through the same door Goodell came through and casually strolled up to the podium where the commissioner was speaking about half-an- hour into the event. 

Wearing a cap and holding another cap in his hand, Bronk was immediately grabbed by a group of around eight security guards and league executives.

As he was led away, he started to scream: 'What are you doing, what are you doing?'

The comedian then added: 'Don't take me to the elevator', referring to video footage of the Baltimore Ravens running back punching his former fiance.  

During the struggle, Bronk tugged at the curtain next to the podium in a bid to stop the guards in his tracks and almost tore it down. 

After he was ejected from the press conference, he then tried to interrupt a CBS broadcast on the floor below. 

Bronk has also interrupted other major media events. In 2011, when then-Congressman Anthony Weiner announced his resignation amid a sex scandal, he jumped forward and started asking the mayoral candidate lewd questions.

The NFL has been rocked by domestic violence issues since a videotape surfaced that showed former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice knocking out his then-fiancee Janay (both pictured at a May 23 press conference) in an Atlantic City, New Jersey, elevator

Hundreds of Baltimore fans have formed a queue stretching back half-a-mile to swap their Ray Rice jerseys for other stars' in reaction to footage that showed the NFL star punching his then-fiancée unconscious
