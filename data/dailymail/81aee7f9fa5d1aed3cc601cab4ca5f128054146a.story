A police employee who killed himself was a suspect in the 1984 murder of a 14-year-old girl, it emerged - and he had been interviewed by officers over the crime.

Kevin Charles Brown, 62, was a criminalist with the San Diego police department during the time that Claire Hough was found dead on a Californian beach in August, 30 years ago.

Investigators at the time could find no leads, but thanks to new DNA techniques, Brown was linked to the girl's brutal death. But as police were preparing to arrest Brown, he was found dead.

Brown had been interviewed in connection with the crime before his apparent suicide, UT San Diego reported.

Claire was found strangled in late August 1984, and was found dead under a bridge at Torrey Pines State Beach which crossed the sands.

Her left breast had been cut away and her body was covered in marks from fingernails.

Reports from the time suggest that Claire had slipped out of her grandparents' house nearby so she could smoke and listen to music cassettes.

Her body was discovered by a walker at 5am. Claire's grandparents raised the alarm when she had not returned by morning, and the body was identified as hers. 

San Diego police, which employed Brown between 1982 and 2002, has said he never had anything to do with investigating Claire's case.

Other suspect: Ronald Tatro was also linked to the murder. He died in 2011

A second suspect who was identified is also dead, leaving the case with no leads. Ronald Tatro died in Tennesse in a boating accident three years ago. 

However, Brown's widow denied that he was anything to do with the murder, and suggested that his DNA could have become mixed with the evidence sampled because he worked in the same lab.

He had been questioned several times over the death, Channel 10 News reported, and preparations were being made to arrest him. 

Rebecca Brown said: 'The police have hounded my husband all year, and he ended up having a nervous breakdown and killed himself.

'They kept hounding him on something he didn’t do. He’s a good, kind, sweet, gentle man.'

The police department has dismissed the notion that accidental contamination could be the reason for Brown's DNA being present.
