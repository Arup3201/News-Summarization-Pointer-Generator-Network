A great-grandmother claimed today that she has been plunged into permanent darkness after new homes were built all around her house.

Margaret Thomas, 62, opens the blinds in her three-bedroom house in Old Yardley, Birmingham, each morning only to be confronted by the brick walls of two new three-storey detached homes.

Following the construction of the properties - on the market for up to £350,000 as part of a new development called Spire View - healthcare assistant Mrs Thomas has to leave on her lights all day.

Blackout: Mrs Thomas claims the six affected properties did not receive letters when the planning application was made in summer 2012, but Birmingham City Council insists it sent them out

She said: ‘I feel completely hemmed in by this. I have been here 25 years and brought my family up here. But now I can’t bear to stay - it is making me ill. I used to love my garden but can’t enjoy it now. Surely I have a right to light.’

Mrs Thomas claims the six affected properties did not receive letters when the planning application was made in summer 2012, but Birmingham City Council insists it sent them out.

She added that her subsequent complaints to builder Kendrick Homes and the council, which gave planning permission in October 2012, have allegedly fallen on deaf ears.

Mrs Thomas and her next-door neighbour Michael Croake have been told their only options are to re-mortgage their homes to fund costly legal action, with no guarantee of success.

The bill includes a ‘right to light’ survey costing up to £4,000. In addition, an estate agent has told Mrs Thomas and Mr Croake that their houses have fallen in value as result of the new development.

The neighbours believe the new homes should have been two storeys and set further back. The large house to the east is just 33ft from Ms Thomas’s back door.

Council planning policy states the distance should be 51ft, but a planning officer allegedly reported at the time that the guidelines were scrubbed in this case to meet demands for new family housing.

Asked why the planning department had ignored the guidance, a council spokesman said: ‘This application was approved after being considered in relation to national and local planning policy.

‘Clearly we have to balance planning guidance against the housing need in the city, and every application is considered on its merits.

‘As a complaint is being considered by the Local Government Ombudsman, we are unable to comment further.’

A spokesman for Kendrick Homes said: ‘We have gone through the statutory planning process and the development was approved by Birmingham City Council.’

Mrs Thomas - who has four children, nine grandchildren and one great-grandchild - has complained to the Ombudsman and is awaiting the outcome. The average house value on her road is £119,000.
