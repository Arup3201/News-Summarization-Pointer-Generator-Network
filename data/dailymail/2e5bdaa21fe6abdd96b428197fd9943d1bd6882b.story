Perched out of a helicopter with his camera in hand, New York-based photographer Jeffrey Milstein has captured spectacular views of giant cruise ships from above. 

Milstein's Cruise Ships series gives a bird's-eye view of the huge floating holiday vessels. The New York-based photographer uses high-resolution camera equipment to capture views from a helicopter with an open door.

They include the Disney Dream, which features a nine-hole mini-golf course, 11 nightclubs and lounges and the first 'water roller coaster': a 765-foot long winding waterslide called the AquaDuck that goes through the ship's funnel.

And this is how the majestic cruise ships look from the side as they force their way through the sea, the Majesty of the Seas on the left, and the Freedom of the Seas on the right

Milstein also shot the fourth largest cruise ship in the world in the form of the Royal Caribbean Freedom of the Seas. The $800 million vessel can accommodate 3,634 passengers and 1,300 crew on 15 passenger decks.

Mr Milstein said: 'Giant cruise ships, over three football fields long, have become unique floating cities. Photographed symmetrically from directly above in very high resolution, the large gallery prints, up to 74 inches, show the viewer a detailed view not commonly seen. 

'The ships can be seen with their passengers lounging on deck chairs, playing on water park slides, putting greens, running tracks, and basketball courts. 

They have a curious beauty and tell us something about how we as a culture form instant communities for shared recreation and relaxation. 

The Disney Dream cruise ship is radiant in the sea with a nice clash of lighting, while right, The Carnival Victory can cater for 2,754 people and is an awesome sight at night

Disney Dream looks somewhat different when viewed from land, showing its height and the navy and red livery, and right, The Carnival Victory is an imposing sight

The Caribbean Princess has a giant poolside movie theatre that will impress, while right, The Carnival Victory has fine dining throughout

The modern Caribbean Princess ship offers all the comforts of home and more, with space for 3,082 guests and all of the signature features

'The ships which continue to be built larger and larger are fascinating to ponder as engineering marvels. Seen as a typology, they share a common symmetry derived from function, yet juxtapose design elements both decorative and functional that set them apart.

'This ongoing series which began in 2013, is related to the Aircraft series which I have been shooting for over 15 years. I take most of these photos using an 80 mpxl digital medium format camera with a gyro stabilizer, shooting from a helicopter with the door off.'

The large highly detailed gallery prints will be on exhibit at Benrubi Gallery in Manhattan, from July 9 until August 22.

The Carnival Sensation has three waterslides, and makes two trips a day to the Bahamas from the US; pictured right is the Norwegian Sky Cruise Ship has 13 dining rooms and 12 bars

Carnival Sensation is immediately recognisable thanks to its forked funnel, a feature on every Carnival vessel, while pictured right is the Norwegian Sky Cruise Ship, with a very different look
