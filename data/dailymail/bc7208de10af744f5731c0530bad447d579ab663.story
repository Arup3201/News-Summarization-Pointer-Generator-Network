The chairman of Laxey Partners has urged the wider Rangers support to take on Mike Ashley – after his firm sold its 16 per cent stake in the club to three wealthy businessman.

The Isle of Man investment firm’s chief Colin Kingsnorth confirmed he had completed a deal with Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor in order to halt Ashley’s Ibrox takeover.

He also accused chairman David Somers of being a ‘wet fish’ and admitted his disillusionment with the ruling Ibrox regime after Norman Crighton, Laxey’s man on the board, decided to quit earlier this month. 

Mike Ashley's plans to take further control at Rangers have been stymied by SFA rules on dual interest

The decision to sell 13.3million shares to the men dubbed the Three Bears is widely seen as an attack on the Ashley’s iron grip of Rangers. Kingsnorth believes the billionaire Sports Direct tycoon can only be stopped from inside the Ibrox boardroom.

‘I sold because a fans-based group were hopefully going to be the best placed to take on Ashley’s power,’ Kingsnorth stated.

‘After Ashley removed Norman Crighton, Ashley’s most vocal critic, it was obvious David Somers was just a wet fish agreeing anything Ashley wanted.

‘I am sure the Three Bears are an upgrade on us for fans and hopefully this is the start of the ownership being in the right hands.’

Sportsmail understands that club legends Walter Smith and Ally McCoist – who hold a combined stake of around two per cent - and a myriad of fans with 10 per cent are firmly behind the Three Bears’ move.

A day of high drama in the Ibrox power game took a dramatic twist shortly after trading began on Wednesday morning when the three wealthy supporters snapped up 16 per cent of the club.

The £2.6m deal sees Park, Letham and Taylor become the biggest single shareholders in the club with close to 20 per cent of the equity. A stock market announcement has yet to confirm the precise identity of the buyers and sellers with official notification unlikely before Friday.

But sources claim bus tycoon Park, Letham and Taylor are the purchasers after they announced plans for a £6.5m investment last week.

Last week the three offered to buy up all the new stock issued in a pending fresh share issue. Existing shareholders will be given first refusal – and by purchasing Laxey’s stake the three will now be guaranteed a chance to up their stake when new shares are sold.

The development has all the hallmarks of a game-changer in the battle for control of the Ibrox boardroom.

Although Wednesday's purchase does not automatically mean boardroom representation for the three, significantly they are now in a position to call an EGM.

If enough support can be gathered from other factions, potentially they could now seek the removal and appointment of directors. The development will be seen a threat to the grip Ashley and the Easdale brothers presently have on the club.

Although Sandy Easdale stated on Tuesday that he would be open for talks with the Three Bears, the chairman of the football board was believed to be referring to an investment as opposed to the kind of power grab witnessed on Wednesday.

City sources have pointed out that that the proceeds of Wednesday's share sales will go to Laxey rather than the football club.

Newcastle owner Ashley’s plans to up his stake in the club to 29.9 per cent have been stymied by SFA rules on dual interest. Last week the SFA Board, having met with Rangers chief executive Derek Llambias, flatly refused to accede to a request to allow Ashley to further increase his stake from nine per cent. 

Rangers fans have protested outside Ibrox on numerous occasions at the running of their football club

Ashley and Rangers have already been charged by the governing body due to perceived breaches of an agreement on boardroom control, and although the Londoner would be entitled to ensure his existing stake isn’t diluted in the new rights issue, exceeding that percentage would guarantee another clash with officialdom.

That situation has opened the door for Park, Letham and Taylor who could now buy circa 20 per cent of the new issue – as well as any unsold shares – to strengthen their position in the coming weeks.

A spokesman for the consortium said they had no comment to make on Wednesday night.

But their move saw fans ownership group Rangers First witness a surge in membership after news of a shift to the Ibrox powerbase emerged.

Over 200 fans moved on Wednesday morning to pledge financial support for the group’ s aims of giving supporters a say in the club’s running via the purchase of shares.

Hearts and Hibernian have already moved towards a supporter led model. Encouraged by the emergence of the wealthy Rangers supporters, Rangers First now hope to hold discussions with the group.

Ronnie Johnston of Rangers First told Sportsmail: ‘We have had an unprecedented surge in membership this morning.

‘We have gone from 1900 members on Monday to 2100 in one day. The surge created by a little bit of positive news tells me that a lot of people thought fan ownership was something that could only be triggered by crisis. 

Ibrox has not seen Premiership football for a number of years as Rangers attempt to climb the leagues

‘That may have been what happened at Hearts and Hibs. But it looks like a bit of good news can bring the fans to the table as well.

‘Our strategy is now to wait and see what happens. To see who is the big shareholder and then use our members’ permission to engage with that group.

‘It will be good to see who has bought these shares and have a conversation.

‘Tom Farmer would appear to have cut a deal with Hibs supporters and whoever this is it could be that there is an opportunity now for Rangers supporters to do something similar.

‘There has been division amongst the Rangers support up until now. But I think the division has been created by the unknown and by fear.

‘For Rangers fans this could be the moment when they say that if Letham, Taylor and Park have broken the back of the problem then they will put their shoulder to the wheel too. I hope that is the case.

‘It’s an important day for Rangers on the 44th anniversary of the Ibrox disaster now.

‘I hope the fans come out now and demonstrate their passion and care for the club by sending out a powerful message.’

The news of the Three Bears’ investment was welcomed by the club’s football board chairman Sandy Easdale and his brother, PLC director James.

Their spokesman Jack Irvine said: ‘If the reports are accurate, Sandy and James are delighted that Mr Park and his friends have bought the Laxey shares and they hope they will further invest in the club.

‘As we said yesterday the Easdales and Messrs Park, Taylor and Letham have a common goal - the re-emergence of Rangers as a footballing power.’
