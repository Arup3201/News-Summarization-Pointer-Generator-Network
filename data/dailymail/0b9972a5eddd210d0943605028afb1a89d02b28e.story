The host of a Facebook party which ended in violent street chaos after it was shut down by police has vowed not to stop organising events.

Officers were attacked with beer bottles and saw their vehicles smashed after being called to the party in Holland 
Park on Brisbane's southside on Friday night.

More than 500 people attended the gathering which was organised through Facebook.

Packed party: The host of a Facebook party which ended in violent street chaos after it was shut down by police has vowed not to stop organising parties

'I've learnt a lesson, but I'm not going to stop holding parties,' said one of the hosts, who gave his name as Ayad Fadil, 17, to the Courier Mail.

'But not at the house. I just want to say sorry again.'

He told ABC News that he had hired 16 security guards for the event and attendees were charged 45-$10 entry. 

In the days before the party, a note was dropped into houses in Beddoes Street reading:

'Dear neighbour, This is to inform you I will be hosting my sister's 16th birthday party.

Warning: Before the party, a note was dropped into neigbours's homes in Beddoes St

'There will be moderate music playing from 7pm to roughly 11pm. I hope this does not cause too much inconvenience to your night.'

A number was also attached informing neighbours: 'If you have any concerns, please contact me,' and a number was written down. 

The host admitted that he had invited 200 people because his mother was at work, but the party invites had spread.

Neighbours called police at 7pm, but according to authorities a large number of the people became unruly and started damaging vehicles and smashing bottles

It took police an hour to clear revellers from the party and two of their vehicles had to be towed from the scene.

A neighbour told the Australian it was 'disgusting to watch' as the party-goers turned against police.

'What a huge drain on police resources when they could be doing something more meaningful,' she said.

'It's just obscene and so surprising for our area.

Another neighbour Rashad Ali said there was also a party the previous week at the same house with more than 100 guests.

He told ABC News the police presence seemed to agitate the crowd.

'Before the cops came the party was going good - [nobody] got injured, no bottles were thrown - but as soon as they came it was a whole different story,' he said.

On Saturday morning council workers cleaned streets covered in broken glass.

Metro South acting Detective Superintendent Geoff Sheldon told Courier Mail police 
were investigating the party.

This isn't a war zone, this is suburban Brisbane,' he said.

'We're so glad none of our officers were hurt.'

Police arrested and charged a 17-year-old Wakerley man and a 19-year-old Wynnum West man with public nuisance.

They also arrested a 16-year-old boy for being in possession of a dangerous drug.

The two men will appear in Holland Park Magistrates Court on October 22.

The 16-year-old will be dealt with under the provisions of the Youth Justices Act.
