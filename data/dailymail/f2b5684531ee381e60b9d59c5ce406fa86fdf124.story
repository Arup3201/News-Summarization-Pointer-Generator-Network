The nation’s diet has taken a turn for the healthier according to a new survey which found that we are eating out less, consuming fewer total calories and eating better at home.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture study, released on Thursday, found that working-age adults consumed an average of 78 fewer calories a day in 2010 compared with 2005.

They also reported eating more home-cooked meals with their families and reading nutritional labels on food at grocery stores more often.

The study found that there was a 12.9 percent decline in spending on food away from home during the recession.

But the decline in cash-strapped Americans eating out accounted for just 20 percent of the improvements in diet quality, according to the report.

The rest was more influenced by ‘an increase in consumer focus on nutrition in selecting foods, changes in the quality of foods available and greater nutritional information available to consumers,’ said Jessica Todd, a USDA economist who wrote the report.

Overall, the study suggests that working-age Americans are more aware now of what they eat and are making an effort to adopt some healthier diets.

Respondents reported eating meals with less saturated fat and more fiber in 2010 compared with four years earlier.

USDA economists collected data from a total of 9,839 people, using three cycles of surveys from 2005 through 2010.

The study offers new evidence that the U.S. obesity problem, while serious, may have stopped getting worse.

More than one-third of adult Americans are obese, according to the CDC, up from an estimated 15 percent in 1980.

More adults were reading nutritional labels at grocery stores, rising to 42 percent in 2009-10 from 34 percent in 2007-2008, according to the study.

Researchers also found that Americans with at least some college education were slightly more likely to eat healthier diets and had a greater decline in calorie consumption than other adults.
