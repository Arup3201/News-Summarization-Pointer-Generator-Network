A cheeky cabbie took a family's Christmas tree as a ransom when a partygoer failed to pay her fare home.

Jodie Slater, 19, booked a £15 ride back with a friend after a night out but when she arrived at her home in Aberporth, Wales, at 1.30am she realised she didn't have enough money.

She went inside to get the rest from her mother Angie but when they both came out the driver had gone.

The next morning Angie, 54, was stunned to discover the new 6ft tree they had left out to dry on their porch had disappeared.

She called the taxi firm who admitted the driver had taken the £35 tree in his seven-seat car - and said they would only get it back when the fare was paid.

Jodie, a waitress, said: 'It's funny now but in the morning when we discovered what had happened we were a bit put out.

'I'd been on a night out as my friends had just got back from uni and we got a lift back.

'We thought we had enough to pay for it but we didn't so I went inside and tried to find some.

'I was probably looking for around ten minutes and then I had to wake mum up to see if she had some.'

She added: 'She got up and went to pay him but when we both went outside he'd gone.

'The next morning mum called me while I was at work and told me the Christmas tree had gone from in the porch.

'The taxi company said they had it. They took it as a ransom.

'It's not little - it's about six foot. We've got a people carrier but dad had to put it on the roof.

'The driver must have gone to a lot of trouble to take it, he'd have had to fold the seats down.

'I've never known anything like it - it's a good job we've got a sense of humour.'

Jodie and her friend Elisha Jenkins, 22, were coming back from Cardigan, seven miles away, when the incident happened.

The family went to collect the tree from Robin's Taxis the following day and got it back after paying the fare

The family went to collect the tree from Robin's Taxis the following day and got it back after paying the fare.

It has now been decorated and has pride of place in the family's living room.

The boss at the taxi firm who took Jodie Slater's tree said staff always intended to give it back once she had paid her £15 fare the next day.

Owner Robin Davies said the firm usually take mobile phones from customers until they cough up, but when Jodie was reluctant to hand hers over, the driver took her tree instead.

He said: 'She was in Cardigan Saturday night, Sunday morning.

'She flagged the taxi down and when the driver took her home the driver asked her for her mobile phone.

'That's what we normally do - we take the mobile phone and when they come down [to the office] on Sunday or Monday morning, they pay the fare and get their mobile phone back.

'But when the driver took her home, she wouldn't give her mobile phone, but there was a Christmas tree outside the house, the fare was £15, and he put the tree in the car.

'It was a bit funny really.'
