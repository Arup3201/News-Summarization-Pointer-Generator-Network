She was a working mother at a time when it was a less common phenomenon. For Mary Berry, however, trying to juggle her career and family life is something she now says she regrets.

The star of The Great British Bake Off was a magazine cookery editor, first at Housewife and then Ideal Home, and in 1966 published her first book.

But her decision to be a working mother in the late Sixties and into the Seventies is one that still fills her with guilt.

It's a family time of the year, but Christmas for Mary Berry is all about hard work

Mrs Berry, now 77, said: 'I really 
didn't think I was the most brilliant mother.

'I was very keen on 
giving the children the right food, but I didn't play as long as I could
have.

'My husband 
always did the reading every night with the children because I was 
always trying to do two things at once. I didn't do enough homework with
them.'

Mrs Berry, who
has 70 cookbooks to her name, also revealed that she allowed herself 
only five weeks of maternity leave after each child was born – because 
she was too afraid to ask for more time off.

In
an interview with Hello! magazine  she said: 'I would have liked to 
have stayed with the children, but I didn't have enough confidence to 
say, "Okay, I'll take two  years off" as at that time someone else would
have taken over.' 

Mrs
Berry, who lives with her husband Paul, 80, in Buckinghamshire, has two
grown-up children, Tom, 45, and Annabel, 41, who will join them on 
Christmas Day with their five children.

'She
will also be remembering her son William, who was killed in a car 
crash aged 19 in 1989. Mrs Berry added that she prefers her Christmases
to be traditional.

'I am never going to have a silver Christmas tree,' she said.

'It does 
get a bit crazy at times so we'll sit and play Scrabble or go for a 
walk. I also always get a jigsaw puzzle out, so if it all gets too much 
for anyone they can sit and do that quietly for a while.'

And
although Mrs Berry admits to planning the day with military precision, 
she enjoys the atmosphere of fun created by the grandchildren.

She said: 'I love the chaos of it all, but it's got to be planned.'
