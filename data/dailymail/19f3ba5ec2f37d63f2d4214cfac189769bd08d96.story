It’s yet another example of how our British reserve and prudishness about sex leads to unnecessary misery in the bedroom.

A recent survey found although one in five women suffer from vaginal dryness - a common condition that makes sex uncomfortable, painful and sometimes impossible - 90 per cent of women suffer in silence.

Even more ludicrous: a trip to the pharmacy for some simple gels and lubricants could solve the problem in an instant.

Vaginal dryness can make sex painful or even impossible, and 18% say they have stopped having sex

Why don’t the majority of women get help or know this?

Because, despite being a society saturated in sexual images, important, helpful sex information about conditions like vaginal dryness simply aren’t talked about.

So please women of all ages, stick with me and let’s do it here and now!

You don’t have to be ‘old’ to suffer from a dry vagina. Too much alcohol, not enough water, where you are in the menstrual cycle, stress, not feeling aroused enough, menopause - all can stop our vagina’s lubricating properly.

Without lubrication, his penis isn’t able to penetrate easily and sex feels uncomfortable, painful and - if severe - becomes impossible.

Not being ‘wet enough’ is the female equivalent of him not getting an erection: women feel embarrassed because they think he’ll think they’re not ‘turned on’ enough.

If you’re single, you avoid starting relationships, thinking the guy will think you don’t fancy them. Married women avoid sex not just because it hurts but for fear their partner will feel rejected.

The survey of 2000 adults, found one-fifth of women were depressed because of vaginal dryness, a quarter said they felt ‘less feminine’, nearly half felt ‘old’ because of it and one in 10 men said it had impacted on their sex life.

A trip to the pharmacy for some simple gels and lubricants could solve the problem in an instant

Thirty-four percent of sufferers said it had driven a wedge between them and their partner - nearly a fifth don’t have sex at all because of it!

Forty-two percent experience pain during intercourse because of it, one third have incessant itching and a further 31 per cent feel sore after sex.

But in true British style, instead of talking with our partners and doctors about it - and discovering instant, inexpensive, no-hassle solutions - most women say nothing.

We’d prefer to watch our sex lives disappear and threaten our marriages than speak up out of embarrassment.

Ninety percent of the women surveyed wouldn’t even talk to their female friends about it.

This is utter madness! Madness because all you need to solve it are two simple products.

First, a moisturizing cream that replenishes the dehydrated vaginal skin which stops sex feeling painful and you feeling irritated and itchy.

This survey was commissioned by Vagisan, who manufacture a moisturizing cream designed to solve the problem. Replens, Sylk, and various other brands also make one. The average cost is £11 and you can buy them at any pharmacy.

The second product to buy is a good quality personal lubricant, also available from any pharmacy and online (my own supersex lovelube brand is perfect for this) for under a tenner.

Use both and the problem will usually disappear within two weeks.

It’s that easy - and most sex problems are that easy to sort as well. All it usually requires is a bit of honest communication, a visit to the doctor or a quick search on the internet for solutions and the problem is fixed.

If only we could move past that British I-can’t-possibly-because-I’m-too-embarrassed attitude, we’d all be so much happier and healthier.
