A baby girl suffered serious head injuries after a horrific fall from a first-floor bedroom window.

One-year-old Lilly Taylor was taken to Birmingham Children's Hospital with life-threatening injuries after the accident at her home in Tipton, West Midlands last Thursday.

Lilly was seen by a passing neighbour who called an ambulance after she tumbled out of a rear bedroom window and hit her head on concrete and bricks in the garden, fracturing her skull - requiring urgent brain surgery.

But last night, her father Craig, 26, said the little girl has woken up after surgery and is eating well.

He told the Birmingham Mail her condition had improved dramatically over the weekend and she should be allowed home this week. 

'She is doing a lot better,' he said. 'The doctors are just amazed at how well she has been doing. She is up and about now, walking around a bit, and eating well.'

'It's a big relief - it has been a really hard time.

'She should be able to be back at home by Wednesday at the latest.' 

The father of two also explained that Lilly was due to have a brain scan shortly to try and establish whether any long-term damage had been caused by the fall.

Paramedics, including an air ambulance, arrived at the scene in Tipton on Thursday morning after Lilly fell from the rear bedroom window.

Craig, who had been out at a shop buying wallpaper paste at the time of the accident, arrived home shortly afterwards and put Lilly in the recovery position.

They waited for medics after a neighbour had called for an ambulance.  

He said: 'They are scanning her to make sure everything is OK.

'We are all keeping our fingers crossed that there has been no long-term damage.

'It's been a lot for her, as she is too young to understand.

'I spoke to her on FaceTime and she got upset at seeing herself on the phone as she has lost all her hair.

'We'll be taking her back to her Grandma's when we leave, until we are confident that the house is totally safe.'
