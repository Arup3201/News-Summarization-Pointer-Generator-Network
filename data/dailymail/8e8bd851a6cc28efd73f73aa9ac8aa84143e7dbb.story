Torment: A bandaged Jan Middleton

He is the eminent surgeon on the TV show Botched Up Bodies, happy to condemn and correct the blunders of other doctors who have devastated the lives of their victims.

But The Mail on Sunday can reveal that one of the NHS patients of craniofacial surgeon Niall Kirkpatrick was left horribly disfigured.

Mr Kirkpatrick is lead clinician  at the Craniofacial Unit of London’s Chelsea & Westminster Hospital and specialises in reconstructive facial surgery for the NHS.

He lives in a £2.2 million home with his family in West London and is believed to earn more than £350,000 from his NHS job, private consultancy and TV work.

But in February this year, Imperial College Healthcare Trust was forced to make a six-figure payment and issue a grovelling letter of apology to former City solicitor Jan Middleton, 55, after it accepted that repeated errors following surgery in 2009 had left her severely damaged.

Miss Middleton’s surgeon and consultant was Niall Kirkpatrick.

Mr Kirkpatrick denies that he was responsible for Miss Middleton’s condition, but the Trust admitted guilt. It accepted she had not been adequately advised about the risks of the surgery, and that those treating her failed to provide adequate antibiotics to prevent infection.

When infection arose, it conceded, they failed to act quickly enough to prevent it spreading.

For Miss Middleton, of West London, the apology is too little, too late. In 2012, while struggling with the recurring infection that has spread since her first surgery, she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and has been given less than a year to live.

She is speaking out now after seeing Mr Kirkpatrick criticising the work of other surgeons on the Channel 5 programme. ‘I’d be interested to see his face if he was presented with me and my face, and told this had been done by another surgeon,’ she said.

‘He no doubt has skills  as a surgeon but I think it is wrong of TV producers to continue to make shows featuring him after what happened to me.’ Miss Middleton was referred to Mr Kirkpatrick in 2008 after a scan revealed a non-cancerous brain tumour.

Mr Kirkpatrick and David Peterson, a consultant neurosurgeon at the Chelsea & Westminster, advised Miss Middleton that she should have an operation to remove the tumour.

The six-hour procedure, which involved a bone graft and the installation of a titanium plate, was carried out at Charing Cross Hospital on January 8, 2009.

Miss Middleton was advised she would need three months off work. She has not been able to return.

In the wake of the surgery, infection set in. It spread and ate steadily into her face, bone and brain. Discharge also seeped forcefully from a wound.

‘My hair fell out in clumps,’ she said. ‘I couldn’t see properly out of my left eye. I had blackouts and  terrible headaches.’ In March 2009, she had the first of several operations to reduce the build-up of fluid behind the wound. Mr Kirkpatrick sent specimens of the discharge for testing.

The Trust later accepted that Miss Middleton was not prescribed appropriate antibiotics after her first operation in January 2009 – and guidelines recommending the appropriate length of time they should be taken for were not followed.

When the infection was discovered, there was again an unacceptable delay before antibiotics were prescribed.

On September 9, 2009, Miss Middleton underwent a further operation to remove the plates, screws and dead bone that survived from the first procedure. The left side of her face was then reconstructed.

During that surgery, a swab of her forehead revealed that she had developed two serious and drug-resistant infections.

Yet incredibly, she says, she was never told of the risks of the original operation, or, as problems persisted, that her face would never look the same after the reconstruction.

'So happy': Miss Middleton before her surgery ordeal

‘It wasn’t until one of Mr Kirkpatrick’s medical team cruelly said to me, “Oh well, you’ll just have to see it as an opportunity to develop other aspects of your personality,” that it struck home. My face had been ruined for ever.’

Eventually, Miss Middleton abandoned trust in her surgeon and turned to other specialists.‘I was told the radical surgery I had had could have been avoided in the first place,’ she said. ‘I learned that inappropriate antibiotics were used and they were not prescribed for long enough.’

By 2011, Miss Middleton was so distraught that she approached Dignitas, the Swiss euthanasia clinic, while considering ending her life. She said: ‘My life had been blown apart. Everything I had worked for – my career, my ability to travel .  .  .  it was all gone. But despite the fact  I will never have the life I once had, the instinct to survive took over.’

However, in 2012, she learned that she had pancreatic cancer and underwent surgery and chemotherapy.

Mr Kirkpatrick strenuously denies that her treatment was inadequate. He told The Mail on Sunday: ‘She has been impossible to treat.  She refused to have much of the treatment we recommended. The Trust did not consult with me before admitting liability.’

Miss Middleton, however, insists she never refused treatment before the September 2009 surgery.

She added she had contacted broadcasting watchdog Ofcom with details of her case, referring to  Mr Kirkpatrick’s appearance on Botched Up Bodies. However, she claims Ofcom was not interested in investigating because she had not featured on the show.

In the meantime, Miss Middleton is trying to come to terms with her fate. She said: ‘The other day I found a picture of me in a garden looking happy. It’s like you have one kind of life one moment, then someone pulls the rug and it is gone.’

Imperial College Trust said: ‘An out-of-court settlement has been agreed in this case. The Trust has admitted there were some shortcomings in the care provided to this patient in 2009 and we have apologised to the patient for this.

‘All staff involved in this patient’s care were given robust extra training where the investigation showed it was required.’

lJan Middleton has donated  part of the fee for this interview  to The Face Trust, which supports research that will lead to the first full face transplant in the UK.
