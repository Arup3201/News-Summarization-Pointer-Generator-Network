She's the other gorgeous daughter of My Kitchen Rules' Texan cowboy Robert Murphy and 21-year-old Mareesha is studying to follow in her Dad's footsteps as a visual artist.

She is just two years younger than sister Lynzey, who triumphed in the kitchen with their Dad on the Wednesday night cook-off at the Murphy family's Blue mountains home at Hazelbrook, west of Sydney.

But Mareesha Murphy has the same glossy long brown locks and stunning looks as her sister, as well as the drive and determination to succeed in her chosen field.

The other daughter: Mareesha Murphy, 21 (pictured) is the other gorgeous daughter of My Kitchen Rules' Texas cowboy Robert Murphy. Two years younger than sister Lynzey, who with dad Robert scored a '10' for their Texan inspired entree on MKR, Mareesha is studying art

Blessed: MKR Chef and former Texan horse wrangler Robert Murphy (pictured, centre) says he he's 'blessed' by a wife, Desley and by his 'great kids', from left, fellow MKR chef  Lynzey, 23, Louis, 19, Matt, 23, and Mareesha, 21

Determined: Mareesha Murphy (pictured) is also a pretty good cook, but while her dad and sister Lynzey compete on My Kitchen Rules, she is working as a tourist guide and studying to became a visual arts teacher

She is studying visual arts, just like father Robert, who behind the laconic cowboy image portrayed on MKR is actually the holder of four university degrees. 

Both Murphy girls, who have two brothers, Lynzey's twin, schoolteacher Mathew and 19-year-old aspiring police officer Louis, have inherited their looks from their mother Desley.

Robert Murphy met his wife, a brunette beauty in her early 50s who hails from Toongabbie in western Sydney, while she was backpacking in Canada almost 30 years ago. She has so far requested to stay out of the media hype for MKR.

Artistic: Mareesha Murphy is studying visual arts and may become a teacher just like Robert, who taught for more than two decades at the Bethel Christian School in Mount Druitt in Sydney's western suburbs

Show time: Robert Murphy, 61, and his daughter Lynzey, 23,  in their home kitchen during the filming of the MKR episode. The pair cooked a winning Texan-themed meal of quail, peppered beef, corn on the cob and bourbon-flavoured bread pudding

Cooking for friends: At home Robert Murphy (pictured in his Blue Mountains kitchen) likes to slow cook meals such as rib eye steaks, which he says is impossible to do under the time pressure of  My Kitchen Rules

Iconic spot: Mareesha Murphy works at the scenic railway in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney, where tourists flock to take the steepest rail rise in the world or travel in the cable car (pictured) across the famous bushland

Lone Star welcome: Robert Murphy outside the front door of his Blue Mountains home, west of Sydney, where he and wife, both school teachers, raised four children including Robert's MKR team chef, daughter Lynzey

Desley Murphy is a primary school teacher who teaches at a school not far from Hazelbrook.

The couple were married in 1990 and Desley gave birth to twins Lynzey and Mathew in Texas. The family returned home to Australia, where Mareesha and Louis were born, although all four children have dual US and Australian citizenship.

Robert is an accomplished artist and his paintings adorn the walls of the Hazelbrook house, among the more obvious items which relate to his career as a cowboy and outdoorsman working with his late father, Glyn Ed Murphy, a well known Texan horseman and former US Army Air Corps officer in WWII.

Like father: Robert Murphy (pictured with his father, Glyn Ed Murphy) grew up in Breckenridge, Texas where father and son worked as cowboys, hunting guides and horse trainers. Murphy Snr, a former US Army Air Corps officer, was known in Texas as a man who could train any horse for any thing 

Cracking the whip: He no longer rides the Texan ranges roping cattle for a living, but Robert Murphy still practises at his family home (pictured) west of Sydney

The fitness and athleticism that went with Robert's jobs as a hunting and fishing guide and rounding up and training horses has been passed down to his children, and in particular his daughters.

MKR contestant Lynzey, 23, is a personal trainer and fitness addict when she is not creating dishes in the kitchen. She is formerly a state championship netball player and all round good athlete.

Younger sister Mareesha is no slouch, her father revealed, having also played on the school netball team and competed in the high jump as a teenager.

Now Mareesha, who has worked in a western Sydney cafe to fund her studies and now works as a guide at the Blue mountains Scenic Railway, is studying to become a visual arts teacher.

She lives at the family home in a tranquil street in the Blue Mountains, surrounded by bushland.

But like her father, she also has skills in the kitchen. 'Lynzey loves cooking, but Mareesah is really good. Louis is pretty good and Matt, well he can make a steak and he can probably cook an egg.'

Robert, a regular at his nearby Baptist church, says God has blessed him with 'great kids, a great wife, great family and a great country (Australia)'.
