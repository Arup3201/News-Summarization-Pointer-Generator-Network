 

The Burning Man festival came to its traditional spectacular conclusion on Saturday night, when the huge wooden effigy that gives the event its name was set alight. 

To the sounds of Johnny Cash, Black Sabbath and Joy Division, the Man was set on fire by festival officials in gothic-style robes.

More than 70,000 revelers have spent the last week camped out in the Nevada desert, with many of the wealthier ones constructing elaborate luxury encampments with chefs and air conditioning.

Money is banned at the event and all attendees must bring everything they will need for the week. 

But now it is time for them to return to the real world. 

And as the festival grows increasingly popular with young wealthy tech entrepreneurs from San Francisco, reports suggest the city's upmarket Mission district has been virtually deserted for the past week.   

On Friday a project almost 12 months in the making called Embrace - a 72-foot wooden sculpture of two people lovingly looking into each other, built across studios in Vancouver and Portland - was reduced to nothing but dust and ash.

The remote week-long rave in the Nevada desert - often described as 'where Mad Max meets Woodstock' - culminates each year with many of the statement artworks going up in flames, in a symbol of catharsis, reflection and new beginnings.

'In short, Embrace is about asking people to consider why death is so challenging and why it’s also so beautiful,' lead artist Matt Schultz said on a website for the sculpture.

Later in the day, thousands of the almost 70,000-strong crowd gathered at Embrace to watch as the first of this year's sculptures was burned, taking a moment to remember Cipicchio.  

This year's festival has already been dogged by moments of controversy.

Black Rock Desert was doused in rain in the lead up to the gate's opening on August 25, forcing organizers to turn people away until the grounds had dried and the proper festival infrastructure could be put back together.

Next, hardcore 'Burners' complained the essence of what the festival represented - a society without currency built on sharing and freedom - had been ruined by an influx of tech billionaires that brought with them a five star experience, complete with luxury RV's, top shelf liquor and even bodyguards.
