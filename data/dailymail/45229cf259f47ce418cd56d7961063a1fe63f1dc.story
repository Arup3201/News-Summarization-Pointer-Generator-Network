Cristiano Ronaldo has had quite a career. From Sporting Lisbon, to Manchester United, to the very top at Real Madrid.

To celebrate his third Ballon d'Or title, and second in a row, one Ronaldo fan has created a flipbook animation of his most memorable moments, shown while walking through the streets of Manchester to Madrid.

Beginning outside Old Trafford, Ronaldo's home between 2003 and 2009, the creator heads south to London, all the while replaying highlights of his best moments in Manchester red.

Walking through the capital, Ronaldo's famous free-kick against Portsmouth in January 2008 flips by.

On to a plane, the next chapter of Ronaldo's career is seen. An £80 million move to Los Blancos.

The video shows all of Ronaldo's best and most important goals, detailing why he has been crowned the world player of the year for two seasons running.

And at 29, he is in his prime, with 35 goals in 30 matches in all competitions this season.

As the flipbook arrives at the Bernabeu, it appears there is plenty still to come from the man staking a claim as the best to have ever played the game.
