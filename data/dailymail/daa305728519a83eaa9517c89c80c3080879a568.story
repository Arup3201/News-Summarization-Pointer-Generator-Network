Footballer Nile Ranger has been cleared of raping a woman in a hotel.

The former Newcastle United striker banged on the sides of the dock and said 'Thank God for that' after the foreman delivered the not guilty verdict.

As he walked out he thanked the jury and pulling off his tie said: 'What a joke.'

Relief: Footballer Nile Ranger leaves court with friends this afternoon having been found not guilty of raping a woman in a hotel room

Nile Ranger leaves court after a jury found him not guilty of raping a woman. After the foreman delivered the not guilty verdict Ranger banged on the sides of the dock and said 'Thank God for that'

The 22-year-old denied the accusation and said they had consensual sex after going out drinking together.

He
 told Newcastle Crown Court he had never engaged in sexual activity with
 a woman against her will and the jury returned the not guilty verdict 
after the week-long trial.

Ranger and the woman had met in a city centre bar and gone on to different clubs before eventually booking into the Carlton Hotel, in Jesmond, Newcastle.

Giving evidence, the woman said that she had no memory of the night after the first bar they were in until she woke up naked next to Ranger in bed.

Ranger told her she should take the morning after pill. She left and they continued to swap messages that day, the court heard.

She then visited her GP, was checked at hospital and made a rape allegation to police.

But after being arrested Ranger, now 
playing for Swindon Town, told the police they had had sex more than 
once and that she had engaged 'whole heartedly' and 'enthusiastically'.

The court heard that the pair had been messaging for a year before the incident, with Ranger often trying to meet up with her.

This had led the student to refer to him as a 'predator' and 'Nile Ripper' in some texts they exchanged.

Dismissing the jury, Judge Evans thanked them for their consideration.

A formidable talent on the pitch has given Nile Ranger opportunities most youngsters can only dream of.

But the striker, who represented his country at the Under-19 level, has had his promising future hampered by a string of brushes with the law.

Ranger previously has spoken of how he got embroiled in gang culture while growing up in London.

He served an 11-week sentence in a young offenders institution when he was 15 after he took part in an armed street robbery.

But despite saying 'I never want to go back', the striker found himself again facing charges in 2011, after a 33-year-old man was found outside a Newcastle pub with a broken jaw.

In October 2012 he was finally cleared of two counts of actual bodily harm relating to the incident, after a court heard his actions were in self defence and he had been the victim of racist taunts.

But he was also handed a 12-month conditional discharge after admitting assaulting two police officers who were trying to arrest him in connection with the fight.

But before that case was even resolved, Ranger was given a six-month conditional discharge after admitting a charge of being drunk and disorderly, and sentenced to 120 hours community service after admitting pulling his then-girlfriend's hair during a row.

In the meantime, he was also rapped by the FA and his then club, Newcastle United, for posing with a replica gun in a photograph that was subsequently published in The Sun and making homophobic remarks on Twitter.

He also drew ire from some Newcastle fans after posting a picture on Instagram, spelling out his name in £20 notes.

Ranger made no comment leaving the court but his solicitor, Geoffrey Forrester, said he was delighted with the result.

'It took the jury approximately one hour, after hearing evidence extending over seven days, to find him not guilty,' he said.

'He's obviously delighted with the result and wants to get back to doing what he does, playing football, and he just wants to get on with his life.'

During the trial the jury heard about trouble that Ranger had been in previously.

This included serving an 11-week sentence in a young offenders' institution when he was just 15 after he took part in a street robbery. Growing up in North London, he mixed with an older gang, and also had convictions for burglary and handling stolen goods back in 2007.
