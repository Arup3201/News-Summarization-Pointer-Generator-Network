'It will move eastwards over the next few days and there will be dry north westerly winds affecting much of southern parts of Queensland and northern parts of NSW.

'We will see a bit of a change on Sunday with cooler temperatures setting in across NSW and Queensland. 

'Heat wave conditions will persist into early next week in southern inland parts of Queensland. 

'There are severe to extreme fire dangers affecting NSW and elevated fire dangers in Queensland for today and Saturday. We may also see severe winds in Queensland. 

'There are high fire warnings for places like Charleville in southern Queensland. 

'As the trough moves across the country the concentration of the highest fire dangers will be in south east Queensland and northern NSW. 

 'There are elevated fire dangers in northern parts of South Australia and the north west of Western Australia. 

Richard Wardle, the Bureau's Queensland Weather Services Manager, added: ' Temperatures are forecast to peak in the mid-40s in some inland regions, with the potential for record maximum November temperatures to be recorded in the south-east over the weekend.' 

The Bureau has recommenced its Pilot Heatwave Service which provides a measure of the intensity of a heatwave and complements the Bureau's official temperature forecast.

The service uses a heatwave intensity index that assesses the build-up for heat over a period of time, taking into account the long-term climate of a location and the recent variability in minimum and maximum temperatures leading up to the heatwave event.

Visit The Bureau of Meteorology for further information on current heatwave conditions across the country.
