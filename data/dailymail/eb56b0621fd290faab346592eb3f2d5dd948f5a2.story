Cruise lines have changed their itineraries and flights into New York and New Jersey have faced significant delays as Hurricane Arthur gathers strength.

America's East Coast saw the mass cancellation of July 4 celebrations and changes in holiday plans as Arthur strengthened to a Category 2 hurricane before making landfall in North Carolina.

Cruise ship Norwegian Gem cancelled a scheduled port of call at Great Stirrup Cay in the Bahamas due to the incoming storm and instead left the capital Nassau early in a bid to stay ahead of the bad weather.

Three
 ships operated by Royal Caribbean also cancelled scheduled stops at 
CocoCay in the Bahamas in a bid to move on and stay ahead of Hurricane 
Arthur and its surrounding high winds and rain.

Majesty of the Seas, Enchantment of the Seas and Grandeur of the Seas will instead spend extra time at sea.

The
 cancellations came as heavy rain, hail and lightning caused delays for 
flights coming in to the three airports serving New York. Newark Liberty
 International Airport, Kennedy International and La Guardia airports 
saw incoming flights landing late, with departures from Newark also 
delayed by nearly three hours.

Arthur made landfall on the southern end of North Carolina's popular holiday islands the Outer Banks on Thursday night with winds gusting up to 101mph. 

Little
 change was expected in the storm's strength overnight and Friday, and 
Arthur was expected to weaken as it travels northward and slings rain 
along the East Coast.

The
 hurricane reached land at 11.15pm between Cape Lookout and Beaufort, 
North Carolina, near the southern end of the Outer Banks, a 200-mile 
string of narrow barrier islands with about 57,000 permanent residents.

The
 islands are susceptible to high winds, rough seas and road-clogging 
sands, prompting an exodus that began on Wednesday night.

Landfall: Hurricane Arthur hit North Carolina on Thursday night

Among
 the tourists leaving Hatteras Island were 27-year-old Nichole Specht 
and 28-year-old Ryan Witman of Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The couple 
started driving at 3.30am Thursday on North Carolina Highway 12, the 
only road on and off Hatteras.

‘We
 were just saying we were really, really lucky this year that the 
weather was so great, and then this,’ Specht said as she ended a 
two-week vacation.

Before
 the storm hit, tourism officials had expected 250,000 people to travel 
to the Outer Banks for the holiday weekend. Gov. Pat McCrory sought to 
strike a balance between a stern warning to vacationers and optimism 
that part of the busy weekend could be salvaged.

‘Of
 course, this holiday weekend, the July 4th weekend, is one of the 
biggest weekends for coastal tourism in the state, and we anticipate a 
beautiful weekend after the Tropical Storm Arthur or the Hurricane 
Arthur is out of North Carolina,’ he said.

Tropical
 storm warnings were also in effect for coastal areas in South Carolina 
and Virginia and as far north as Cape Cod, Massachusetts.

Torrential rain and high winds from South Carolina to Boston threatened to hamper July 4 Independence Day celebrations for millions of Americans. Nearly 500 flights have been delayed and 300 cancelled Thursday.
