Police say they are looking for a group of 'cowards' who beat a homeless man to death as he slept in an alley in downtown San Francisco.

Police spokesman Albie Esparza said Wednesday that Tai Lam's body was found inside a sleeping bag.

Esparza tells KGO-TV  that the 67-year-old man was 'savagely' beaten by three suspects early Monday. Investigators are reviewing surveillance footage in an effort to locate them.

The location: The suspects are believed to have found Esparaza sleeping in an alley behind buildings near the corner of Montgomery and Sutter streets

Esparza says Tai was not robbed, and there was no clear motive in the attack. He says it was 'a vicious, unprovoked attack by these coward suspects.'

The suspects are believed to have found Esparaza sleeping in an alley behind buildings near the corner of Montgomery and Sutter streets, a police spokesman said.

They then allegedly proceeded to beat him to death.

Esparza says investigators hope to release a description of the suspects soon.

'It's a vicious crime and people should be outraged that this homeless person was attacked unprovoked and essentially beaten to death,' Esparza said on Wednesday.

Police are asking anyone with video surveillance of the area or anyone who may have additional information about the three suspects to contact San Francisco police investigators.

Unforgiveable: 'It's a vicious crime and people should be outraged that this homeless person was attacked unprovoked and essentially beaten to death,' said Police spokesman Albie Esparza
