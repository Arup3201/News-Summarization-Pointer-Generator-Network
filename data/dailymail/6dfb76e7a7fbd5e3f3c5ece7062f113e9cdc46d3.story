On the face of it, Chairman Mao, Napoleon and the Green Cross Code might seem like they have nothing in common.

But despite that they have all used propaganda to bury themselves in people's minds.

Whether used as a force for good or bad, propaganda is everywhere and a striking exhibition seeks to highlight just how prevalent it can be.

The cult of personality: Chairman Mao and Napoleon used striking portraits of themselves to impress the idea upon a nation that they were the undisputed leaders

Icons: This painting on the left presented Stalin, who was himself from Georgia, exactly as he wanted to be seen: as a cultured, learned scholar. The fictional character Uncle Sam (right) who was used to encourage enlistment in World War I and II, is now a cultural icon, instantaneously recognisable

This collection of posters, scarfs, playing cards and even fans curated by the British Library highlight just how insidious, creative and humorous campaigns can be when trying to impress an idea on to its audience.

The library's exhibition Propaganda: Power and Persuasion, in London, explores how cultures across the world slipped their message into people's minds - whether it be sneakily subtle or unapologetically obvious.

It is the first exhibit to bring Chinese
dictator Mao's little red book and the terrifying drink-driving adverts
together in one exhibition, which will prompt the audience to question 
just how much they are influenced by propaganda.

Curators have explored the myriad ways 
different states have used propaganda to influence the thoughts and 
feelings of a nation, whether the message it carries creates an enemy, 
generates feelings of national pride or promotes a healthy lifestyle.

This slogan on the left has been used in Britain since World War II. The NHS had a mission to improve health through the prevention of disease and campaigns focused on personal responsibility. Those who failed to heed good advice were characterised as a public menace. The Medical Officer journal used striking images (right) to promote better public health. Flies were held responsible for contaminating food and spreading diseases and anti-fly campaigns were held across Britain and the United States

How to win the war: War bond stamps could be mass produced and circulated widely. Liberty provided a symbol that would be understood anywhere in the United States (left). The theme of 'freedom imperilled' deflected from discussion of the rationale for joining the war. In World War I, the Parliamentary War Savings Committee set about using raising funds from the British public. This poster encourages donations by using a simple design to show a direct link between savings and military success (right)

One of the exhibits shows a scarf 
handed out by the British government during World War II to boost weary 
citizens' morale after the country was heavily bombarded by aerial 
attacks.

The scarf, made in 1942, showed a map demonstrating London’s endurance in the face of German bombing.

Winston Churchill's rousing 'We Shall Fight Them on the Beaches' quote and American broadcaster, Ed Murrow’s, famous exultation 'London can take it!', run alongside a map of bomb sites.

Messages that stressed the resilience of Britain and of British character were used to rally and sustain support for the devastating war.

An unusual method of propaganda was used by King George III in the 18th century.

After another bout of sickness, King George III sought to re-establish his authority with a commemorative fan in 1789.

Changing people's minds: The 'violated' Belgians often featured in British wartime propaganda with great emphasis placed on the plight of women, children and the elderly.  This helped sustain British moral condemnation of Germany throughout the War, and was used to imply that a similar threat could face British families. In the Soviet poster (right), New York's Statue of Liberty is parodied as a look-out tower for U.S police to observe its people, mocking the idea that it is a symbol of freedom

One way of getting your message across: This unusual commemorative fan (left) links the well-being of the nation with the health of the King using the phrase 'Health is restored to ONE and happiness to millions'. The cards handed out to U.S troops in the Iraqi war (right) served a practical purpose - soldiers could identify Iraqi leaders - but also sent a message about the extent and quality of the Coalition’s intelligence, and its willingness to seek out the enemy

It linked the well-being of the 
nation with the health of the King by declaring the phrase 'Health is 
restored to ONE and happiness to millions.'

While
the power of persuasion can generate the idea of a common enemy for a 
nation, it can also be used to impress upon citizens the idea of an 
all-powerful leader.

Propaganda
has been used by leaders across the nations to stamp their authority - 
convincing even the most cynical of their power and plans.

Chairman
Mao's image was used in a variety of ways - from badges, to books, to 
posters - so that every citizen in the huge sub-continent country would 
be in no doubt that he was their unchallenged leader.

It can be argued that without this wealth of ways that was used to spread the message of his personality, it would have been very difficult to bring the population under his control.

More than two billion Mao badges, were produced during the Cultural Revolution, ensuring that Mao was seen as the undisputed ruler across China.

The badges became essential for demonstrating revolutionary zeal, allowing wearers to both avoid denunciation and elevate themselves above their peers.

The badges even became an alternative currency used to barter for goods and services. 

Napoleon also used propaganda to announce his rule - portraits were painted to inspire loyalty and intimidate critics at a time when the Emperor's power was declining and France was besieged on all sides.

While many would argue propaganda plays an important part in winning wars - from boosting morale to encouraging soldiers to enlist - it was used in a completely different way int the 2003 Iraq war.

Coalition commanders circulated packs of playing cards to the US-led forces invading Iraq in 2003 to enable troops to identify and capture prominent members of Saddam Hussein's regime.

The cards served a practical purpose but also sent a message about the extent and quality of the Coalition’s intelligence, and its willingness to seek out Iraqi leaders.

The tactic was first used during the American Civil War (1861–65).

Propaganda could also be used to dismiss ideals embedded in other cultures - imperative if a nation wanted to indoctrinate its citizens into conforming to the government's plans.

In a Soviet poster, New York’s famous 
Statue of Liberty is parodied as a look-out tower for the American 
police to observe its people, mocking the idea that it is a symbol of 
freedom.

The Tufty Club was set up in 1961 by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents to encourage better road safety amongst children. Cards and other material helped spread the message as Tufty and his friends learned from Mrs Owl how to cross the road safely

The 'Careless Talk' campaign aimed to discourage people from idly discussing war work and accidentally passing on secrets to enemy agents. More personal and mobile than a poster, the handkerchief and the humorous cartoons on it would have been a talking point in homes and workplaces. The government feared that continued aerial bombardment could lead to a collapse in the morale of British citizens. Messages that stressed the resilience of Britain were used to sustain support for the war

Chairman Mao badges became a symbol used to support the cult of Mao's personality

The poster attacks and subverts American propaganda that promoted the idea of the democratic freedom of the West.

But the art of persuasion isn't just used to convince people of government ideals, or the importance of war - it has been used for far less dramatic purposes.

The Green Cross Code updated previous crossing drills as traffic became heavier and road layouts more complex - but it was with the help of a hero clad in green that the importance of road safety was impressed on people's minds. 

The Green Cross Code Man featured in comics, television advertising and public information films as part of a co-ordinated road safety campaign.

The 1976 media plan shows how various audiences were targeted by different media in order to maximise impact.

Following the 1967 Welsh Language Act, national campaigns increasingly appeared in Welsh as well as English.

Curated by Jude England and Ian Cooke, curators of Social Science at the British Library, the exhibition explores the different ways in which the state has used propaganda to influence the thoughts and feelings of a nation.

Jude England, Head of Social Sciences at the British Library, says: 'We want visitors to consider the role of propaganda in their own lives today, as well as look at the state’s use of propaganda throughout history.

'That’s why, as well as displaying iconic pieces of propaganda from the Library’s collections, such as posters from both World Wars, the Cold War and Vietnam, we’ll also be focusing on more surprising examples, such as the 2012 Olympics and even Twitter – things you wouldn’t necessarily associate with a word like "propaganda"'.

The exhibition runs until September 17 at the British Library, London.
