Parliament is so dilapidated that it would be condemned and demolished were it not one of the most famous buildings in the world

Parliament is so dilapidated that it would be condemned and demolished were it not one of the most famous buildings in the world, experts said yesterday.

The Victorian structure is so stuffed with asbestos and leaky roofs that it will require billions of pounds of renovation just to keep it standing.

In a report commissioned by Parliament, it is warned that MPs and Lords will have to move out of the building within the next decade to enable a massive programme of works to electrics, heating, ventilation systems, drainage and stone work.

They concluded that the World 
Heritage Site - which contains the Commons and Lords chambers as well as
suites of committee rooms, offices and dining rooms - was so 
poorly-maintained that it is ‘remarkable that it continues to function’.

And
they warned that if nothing is done to make it safe, the Palace of 
Westminster could fall victim to a catastrophic fire the like of which 
famously destroyed its predecessor in 1834.

The
report into the ‘looming crisis’ put forward four options for dealing 
with the mess - although MPs have already rejected the nuclear option of
moving out of the Palace altogether, turning it into a museum and 
building an entirely new parliament building somewhere else in London.

Other ideas include continuing with piecemeal repairs costing £26million a year, and spending 10 years on a boosted programme of repairs during weekends and recesses.

The most likely option is to move MPs and peers out of the neo-Gothic edifice altogether, housing them in new temporary buildings on the Parliamentary estate or in facilities such as the nearby Queen Elizabeth Conference Centre or Church House.

Although they do not put a final cost on the work, they say it will be at least £1.6billion.

The damning report on the state of the home of British democracy was ordered by the House of Commons Commission.

It warns: ‘While the precise cost of rectifying these deficiencies is still unknown, investigations conducted in recent years indicate that it is already in excess of 40 per cent of the insurance reinstatement value of the Palace.

Here is just some of the work that needs to be done to the Houses of Parliament to prevent a ‘looming crisis’:

ASBESTOSThe walls and floors are infested with the dangerous substance - putting all occupants of the Palace at risk.

ELECTRICSMuch of the building needs re-wiring, and generators do not produce enough power

VENTILLATIONMany original shafts are filled with wires, and a major failure of the ventilation system is judged to be inevitable.

HEATINGMany boilers date from the 1930s, pipes are clogged with limescale and are in danger of fracturing – causing dangerous steam leaks which could close the Commons chamber for months

FLOODINGFfaulty guttering and broken pipes cause regular flooding, and the Big Ben belfry is particularly badly affected by water penetration. Walls are damp and stained.

LEAKY ROOFSA problem throughout the Palace, particularly as cast-iron roofs are coming to the end of their life.

DANGEROUS CEILINGSSeveral pieces of wood fall from the fourteenth-century roof of Westminster Hall every year, while in 1980 a heavy boss fell from the roof of the House of Lords chamber

DRAINAGE Pipes and culverts seriously overloaded because they are now expected to deal with more waste than expected.

FIRE SAFETYOut of date alarms and automatic detection systems; little ‘compartmentation’ meaning fire can spread easily.

LIFTSOldest lift dates from 1893, several contain obsolete components. Only nine compliant with building regulations.

SUBSIDENCEAlthough the report did not consider this, another problem is that the Palace is sinking into the Thames, with Big Ben already leaning 18 inches.

‘If the Palace were not a listed building of the highest heritage value, its owners would probably be advised to demolish and rebuild.’

There has been no renovation to the 
spectacular building, rebuilt along designs by Charles Barry in the 
1850s, since the late 1940s, following the destruction of the Commons 
chamber by Nazi bombs.

The 
report goes on: ‘Considering the age of the Palace of Westminster, the 
60-plus years that have passed since the partial post-war refurbishment,
the long-term under-investment in the fabric and the intensive use to 
which the Palace is put, it is remarkable that it continues to function.

‘The
signs of wear and tear, the number and frequency of relatively minor 
floods and mechanical breakdowns, the high cost of maintaining 
obsolescent equipment and the large sums that are now having to be spent
on aggressive maintenance and risk reduction all provide tangible 
evidence of the looming crisis.

‘A
growing body of surveys, consultancy reports and risk registers point 
to the further deterioration that will occur and the severe hazards that
could occur if fundamental renovation is delayed indefinitely.

‘It is hard to imagine how the Palace will survive for future generations to use and admire without a major mid-life overhaul.’

Among the many problems facing the building are antiquated electrics, clapped-out boilers and leaking roofs.

Asbestos, which is ‘present throughout the building’, is identified as a ‘risk to all persons within the Palace of Westminster’.

Water
penetration is a particular problem in the belfry of the Big Ben tower.
They warn that if a heating pipe were to snap near the Commons chamber,
the escape of steam would distribute asbestos, putting the chamber out 
of commission ‘for months’.

Many parts of the Palace are in a 
‘shabby condition’. Several pieces of timber fall from the 
fourteenth-century roof of Westminster Hall every year, endangering 
tourists; and a boss once fell from the roof of the Lords chamber.

Fire
safety is another concern. Fire alarms are old, the coverage of 
automatic fire detection systems are incomplete, and there is little 
‘compartmentation’, meaning fire can quickly spread round the building.

The
report warns: ‘Fortunately there have been no major outbreaks of fire 
in the Palace in recent years. Forty minor fires have been recorded, 
however, since 2008. All have been quickly dealt with.

‘Although
these have been minor incidents, there has been some evidence of smoke 
travelling through architectural voids, confirming that current 
compartmentation is unreliable.’

The damning report on the state of the home of British democracy, pictured, was ordered by the House of Commons Commission

It currently costs £26million a year merely doing patch-up jobs in Parliament. The report estimates that at least £1.5billion would be needed for work on the Palace, plus £100million for temporary accommodation required in the meantime.

An option of modernising the building in halves - with the Commons moving into the Lords while work was going on there, vice versa - is frowned upon because ‘the security challenge would be almost insurmountable’.

It concluded: ‘These factors strengthen the case for a complete emptying of the building once alternative accommodation is ready to be brought into use.’

The House of Commons Commission will decide which option to go for over the next year or so after receiving full costings of the work. No renovation will start until after the next election in 2015.
