Letters penned by notorious serial killer Mary Ann Cotton (pictured) have been bought by a private collector for £4,000

Eight personal letters written by a notorious Victorian serial killer have been bought by a private collector despite an appeal to have them preserved for the nation.

Mary Ann Cotton - dubbed the Black Widow - was hanged in Durham Prison in 1873 after being found guilty of poisoning her stepson with arsenic.

Cotton, from West Auckland, County Durham, is also widely 
believed to be responsible for the deaths of up to 20, including her 
husbands and children.

Her letters, written from prison and addressed to a man who had lodged at Cotton's home, make reference to solicitors and financial problems and were put up for sale on eBay.

An online campaign was launched to raise the £4,000 sought for them.

But the money was not raised in time and the letters were bought by a private collector, who wishes to remain anonymous.

However, copies of the letters have since been donated to the Durham Records Office and Beamish Museum in Stanley, County Durham.

The buyer said: 'Unfortunately the campaign's fundraising was very slow, and the seller was keen to sell them sooner rather than later.

'I am a private collector of Victorian crime memoribilia and purchased the letters.

'I have since made high resolution copies which have been sent to Durham Records Office and Beamish Museum, and have also posted scans on the campaign Facebook page.'

Ms Cotton wrote the letters to her lodger, William Lowery, weeks before she was executed.

Heather Holdgate, who was part of the online campaign to buy the letters, said: 'I think the sale of the letters to the collector has turned out well, even though it wasn't the campaign group who were able to secure them.

'He appears to empathise with the desires of the team and has kindly offered to provide good copies of the letters for this group.

'It's not the resolution everyone wanted, but it is the next best thing.'

Cotton was suspected of poisoning 21 people in total, including her own children, husband, lovers and mother

Mary Ann Cotton, who always professed her innocence, is believed to have killed three husbands, a lover, a friend, her mother and 12 children, using arsenic.

They all died suffering from stomach complaints and she was found guilty of murder in March 1873.

She was hanged at County Durham Gaol on March 24 that year.

While Mary Ann Cotton's letters that have sold on eBay might give an insight into the mind of a killer, some now believe that she might not have been guilty in the first place.

She was convicted of only one murder, that of her stepson, after suspicions were aroused when he died shortly after she failed to get him admitted to a workhouse.

He suffered gastro intestinal problems, as had many other people the dressmaker and nurse had dealings with over a 20 year period, including three of her husbands and a number of her children and stepchildren.

Even though in all cases she claimed an insurance pay out, none of these deaths were deemed suspicious, until her stepson died.

An inquest revealed the presence of arsenic, and subsequent exhumations also found the same poison in some of the bodies.

Despite protesting her innocence, she was hanged in March 1873, the execution being delayed until after the birth of her 11th child.

However, some believe the deaths could equally have been due to poverty and poor medical facilities, and she was merely a victim of the times.

Local author, Ian Smyth Herdman, studied the court transcripts, information from the National Archives and newspapers and found a list of errors in evidence and legal process at her trial.

'The available evidence was lacking to say the least,' he said.

'She had no forensic expert to rebuke the prosecutions comments, witness statements in her defence were lodged, but were not acceptable.

'In the accordance with law it would in my opinion be questionable as to her guilty verdict.'
