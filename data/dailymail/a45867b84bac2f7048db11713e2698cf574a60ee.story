Commons Speaker John Bercow has defended plans to charge visitors to the Palace of Westminster to see Big Ben.

From July, visitors will have to pay £15 to climb the 334 steps of the clock tower to see the famous bell - an experience which is currently free.

Mr Bercow said the introduction of charges was to cover costs and would not be used to generate a profit.

Time running out: Visitors will have to pay £15 to go up Big Ben from July in a cost-saving move by the House of Commons Commission

Striking a chord: Tours, which include the 334-step climb to see the famous bell, are currently free

The issue was raised in the Commons by Tory Robert Halfon who urged Mr Bercow to 'look again at the decision' taken by the House of Commons Commission.

The charges would cost a family of four up to £60, he said and asked: 'Are there not other ways of saving money?'

Mr Halfon suggested that copies of Hansard, the official record of parliamentary proceedings, could be published online rather than printed every day as one measure to cut costs.

The Harlow MP called on Mr Bercow to review the charge 'to ensure that we are a parliament for the many, not for the few'.

Mr Bercow said: 'It would be unthinkable to charge members of the public for access to the proceedings of the House or its committees, or indeed to meet their Members of Parliament.'

But, he continued: 'The Clock Tower tours are special tours, allowing access to an area of the Palace which realistically cannot be open to all.

'The charges agreed by the House of Commons Commission are set at a level which will cover the costs - I emphasise, which will cover the costs - of providing these tours. No profit will be made.'

Mr Bercow said it was open to Mr Halfon to take up the matter with the Finance and Services Committee.

Mr Halfon said the proposed changes were a 'disgraceful action' by the Commons Commission.

'The UK taxpayer is already paying for the House of Commons and for Big Ben,' he said.
