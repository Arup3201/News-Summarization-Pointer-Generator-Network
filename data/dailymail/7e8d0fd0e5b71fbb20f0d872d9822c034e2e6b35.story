A teenager and self-described white supremacist made journal entries about a plot to bomb classmates three days after the Sandy Hook school massacre and began building homemade explosives, a sheriff said.

Derek Shrout, 17, is 
charged with attempted assault after authorities say he planned to bomb fellow students at Russell County High 
School in Alabama.

Russell County Sheriff Heath Taylor said on Monday that he believed the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary was a factor because the first date in the boy's journal describing the plan was December 17 - three days after the Connecticut killings.

Chained: Derek Shrout appears at a court hearing to face charges for allegedly planning to use homemade explosives in a terrorist attack on fellow students at his school

Sheriff Taylor said the boy told investigators that he is a white supremacist and five of the six students he named in his journal are black. The journal was found by a teacher, who turned it over to authorities.

A search of Shrout's home found several small tobacco cans and two large cans, all with holes drilled in them and containing pellets, according to authorities.

Taylor said all they needed were black powder and fuses to become explosives. The journal also allegedly mentioned using firearms. The sheriff said Shrout's father owned a few household weapons, such as a hunting rifle, a shotgun and a handgun.

The sheriff said: 'He just talks about some students, he specifically named six students and one faculty member and he talked about weapons and the amounts of ammunition for each weapon that he would use if he attacked the school.'

The sheriff said he didn't believe the teen's initial claim that the journal was a work of fiction.

'When you go to his house and you start 
finding the actual devices that he talked about being made, no, it's not
fiction anymore,' Taylor said.

'Those devices were - all they needed 
was the black powder and the fuse - he had put a lot of time and thought
into that.'

The teen, who is thin and wears glasses, said little during an initial court appearance on Monday. District Judge David Johnson set bond at $75,000 before the teen's family posted bond on Monday night and he was released.

The judge ordered Shrout not to contact anyone at his school, students or teachers, and not to use the Internet without parental supervision. He also must wear an ankle monitoring device.

His attorney, Jeremy Armstrong, declined to discuss specifics of the case, but he did say that the talk of the case he has heard so far was 'blown a little out of proportion'.

'Our position is that our client had no intention to harm anybody,' he said.

Some of Shrout's classmates confirmed his interest in white supremacy. David Kelly, the senior class president, told WTVM-TV that he was Shrout's battalion commander in JROTC.

'At first through JROTC, he was confident, well-rounded, but as time went by, he was doing the whole white power thing,' Kelly told the station.

Another classmate, David White, said Shrout's involvement grew deeper in his short time at the school.

'I
saw that he was taking it more serious than anything, he started 
getting real deep into it, and he had a little group of people doing it 
with him.

'So, I thought it was getting to where I shouldn't be around 
it, so I started not even hanging out with him for a long time,' White 
said.

Shrout detailed his terror plan in a journal 
that was written just three days after the shooting massacre in Newtown,
Connecticut where gunman Adam Lanza killed 20 children and six teachers.

The journal was spotted by a teacher at Russell County High School in Seale, Alabama, and he alerted police.

Police found almost a dozen empty tobacco tins filled with shrapnel inside his bedroom

Small holes had been carefully drilled in the top for a fuse to be inserted

Inside Shrout's bedroom, police found almost a dozen empty tobacco tins filled with shrapnel. Small holes had been carefully drilled in the top for a fuse to be inserted.

Police believe he was becoming involved with an organized neo-Nazi group and learned how to make explosives on the internet.

'The journal contained several plans that looked like potential terrorist attacks, and attacks of violence and danger on the school.

'And in particular, there were six students specifically named, and one teacher,' said Sheriff Taylor.

Police say the devices were just 'a step or two away from being ready to explode. It would have been serious," a spokesman said
