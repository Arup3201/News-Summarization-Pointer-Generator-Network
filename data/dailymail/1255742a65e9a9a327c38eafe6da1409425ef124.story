It's the Spain squad no one watching the Premier League back in January would have thought  possible. Coach Vicente del Bosque named his 23 for Brazil yesterday and Juan Mata and Fernando Torres made the plane at the expense of Alvaro Negredo and Jesus Navas.

‘It breaks my heart to leave Navas behind,’ said Del Bosque. ‘But he has not been right for the past two months and I prefer to take someone who is 100 per cent.’

That criteria was not applied to Diego Costa. Spain’s Brazilian-born striker is struggling with the hamstring problem that reduced his participation in the Champions League final to just eight minutes.

Off the boil: 'The Beast' impressed in the first half of the season before struggling for form and fitness

But the top scoring ‘Spaniard’ in La Liga
 last season is given extra time to get back to full fitness and his 
place in the 23 was only ever going to leave two other striker berths. 
Del Bosque has opted for experience with David Villa and Torres in ahead
 of Negredo.

To overlook ‘The Beast’ Negredo would have been unthinkable at the turn of the year and reflects a  disastrous second half of the season for the Manchester City striker. He did not seem to be too upset by what was ultimately a widely  predicted omission, tweeting that he was off on holiday with model girlfriend Clara Garcia Tapia.

Torres’s inclusion might baffle everyone outside of Spain but he is seen as a big occasion player, an excellent squad member and a favourite of Del Bosque, who has never been convinced by Negredo who he barely used at Euro 2012.

For Navas it represents a major disappointment after being an important squad player four years ago when Spain won the World Cup in South Africa. He came on against Holland in the final and it was his mazy run out of defence that led to Andres Iniesta’s extra-time  winning goal.

He had tweeted just before the squad was announced: ‘Back fully fit and raring to go, ready to have a good World Cup.’

His absence means that both  Arsenal’s Santi Cazorla and Manchester United’s Mata made the cut.

Mata tweeted: ‘Couldn’t be happier, very proud to make the squad, let’s make history again.’

His season was the opposite of Negredo’s with an awful first half out in the cold under Jose Mourinho seeing him leave Stamford Bridge for Old Trafford. Del Bosque’s concerns never centred on Mata’s ability but on his amount of first-team action and the transfer yielded the playing time needed to join Cazorla in the squad.

Despite the absence of the City pair there are 10 players in Del Bosque’s squad who perform, or have played, in the Premier League.

Six of those should feature in Spain’s
 opening fixture against Holland, with the holders likely to name Cesar 
Azpilicueta at right-back in a defence that will include Gerard Pique, 
Sergio Ramos and Jordi Alba; Koke, Xabi Alonso and Sergi Busquets in 
midfield with Iniesta, David Silva and Cesc Fabregas in attack, the 
former Arsenal captain operating as a false nine as he did in the last 
European Championship. 

Spain
 play a friendly against El Salvador on Saturday in Washington. Crocked 
Costa could be given a run-out in that final warm-up with Del Bosque not
 ruling out using Fifa’s Article 29, which allows him to make a final 
squad change 24 hours before their opening game against the Dutch.

If
 Costa is ruled out, Juventus forward Fernando Llorente will take his 
place alongside Fabregas, Torres and Villa as Spain defend their crown.

Goalkeepers: Iker Casillas (Real Madrid), Pepe Reina (Napoli), David De Gea (Manchester United)

Defenders: Sergio Ramos (Real Madrid), Gerard Pique (Barcelona), Raul Albiol (Napoli), Cesar Azpilicueta (Chelsea), Juanfran (Atletico Madrid), Jordi Alba (Barcelona)

Midfielders: Xavi (Barcelona), Xabi Alonso (Real Madrid), Sergio Busquets (Barcelona), Andres Iniesta (Barcelona), Cesc Fabregas (Barcelona), Santi Cazorla (Arsenal), Koke (Atletico Madrid), Javi Martinez (Bayern Munich)

Forwards: David Silva (Manchester City), Diego Costa (Atletico Madrid), Fernando Torres (Chelsea), Pedro (Barcelona), Juan Mata (Manchester United), David Villa (Atletico Madrid)
