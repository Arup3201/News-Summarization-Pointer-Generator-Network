If mankind does ever become embroiled in a Terminator-style 'war against the machines', we're really going to have to start doing a few more press-ups.

Researchers have developed a robotic muscle, an incredible thousand times more powerful than that of a human and capable of hurling an object 50 times heavier than itself.

The breakthrough relies on a material called vanadium dioxide which has a unique ability to change its size, shape and structure when heated.

Robo muscle: The 'micro-bimorph dual coil' developed by U.S. scientists that can hurl an object 50 times heavier than itself

A team at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in U.S. have used vanadium to build a torsional motor which works just like a human muscle, except it is far faster and more powerful. 

The vanadium muscle is capable of catapulting extremely heavy objects over five times its own length in just 60 milliseconds.

But there's no need to worry about hoards of Herculean robots rising up and taking over the world just yet, the proto-type robo muscle is only micro-sized.

Study leader, Junqiao Wu told nanowerk.com 'We've created a micro-bimorph dual coil that functions as a powerful torsional muscle, driven thermally or electro-thermally by the phase transition of vanadium dioxide.

Outclassed: Even the likes of Olympic Gold medalist Jessica Ennis can't compete with the awesome power of the robotic muscle

'Using a simple design and inorganic materials, we achieve superior performance in power density and speed over the motors and actuators now used in integrated micro-systems.'

What makes Vanadium dioxide so unique is that it is an insulator at low temperatures but becomes a conductor when it hits 67C, a bit like plastic transforming into metal.

The scientists hope that this remarkable ability can be harnessed to create far more energy efficient electronic and optical devices.

When heated, vanadium dioxide crystals change their structural form rapidly, both contracting and expanding at the same time. It is this particular trait that the researchers have harnessed to create the robo-muscle.

Dr Wu explains: 'Multiple micro-muscles can be assembled into a micro-robotic system that simulates an active neuromuscular system.

'The naturally combined functions of proximity sensing and torsional motion allow the device to remotely detect a target and respond by reconfiguring itself to a different shape.

'This simulates living bodies where neurons sense and deliver stimuli to the muscles and the muscles provide motion.

'With its combination of power and multi-functionality, our micro-muscle shows great potential for applications that require a high level of functionality integration in a small space.'
