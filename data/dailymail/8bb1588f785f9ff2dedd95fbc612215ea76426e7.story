The top sexual fantasies of women have been revealed in a new book by a prominent female sex writer that aims to revamp Nancy Friday's seminal 1973 bedroom rulebook, My Secret Garden.

Garden Of Desires: The Evolution Of Women's Sexual Fantasies by Emily Dubberley delves into the female sexual zeitgeist and explores what's changed (and why) when it comes to women and sex over the past 40 years: specifically, what turns us on these days.

In her book Dubberley zones in on five key female sexual desires. And they are? Well.

The sexual fantasies of modern women have been revealed in a new book by sex writer Emily Dubberley... and there are five main groups

The post-50 Shades Of Grey, post-Sex And The City era book is a compendium of private stories and innermost thoughts from hundreds of women. As publishers Black Lace comment: 'Female sexual fantasy began in 1973 with Nancy Friday's 
multi-million-selling collection of real women's fantasies, My Secret 
Garden.

'Until that book was published, female sexual fantasy did not 
exist; not even within the pages of Cosmopolitan, their opinion at the 
time being: "Women do not have sexual fantasies, period. Men do."

'Friday's book changed all that. Now, exactly forty years on from 
Friday's masterpiece, leading sex writer Emily Dubberley is curating a 
brand new female fantasy classic for the modern era.

Dubberley, who who edits online erotica site Cliterati, told Belle De Jour writer Dr Brooke Magnanti of the Telegraph: 'I wanted to bring attention to female fantasy and remind women that the idea that women have a private sexuality is a recent sexual freedom - and not something to be taken for granted or brushed under the carpet.'

Her interviews in the book - released by Black Lace publishers on 12 September for Â£10.99 - are with modern women, and exposed five main areas of female sexual fantasy: submissive fantasies, dominant fantasies, exhibitionism and voyeurism, group sex, and partner fantasies.

Dr Magnanti explains the groups here.

Exhibitionism and voyeurism both appear on the list of women's five main sexual fantasies

SUBMISSIVE FANTASIES

Fantasies of this nature vary from simply being tied-up to the bed all the way through to having a formalised sex contract complete with rules about which way you look, in the vein of Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele in 50 Shades Of Grey.

Props such as whips, handcuffs, gags and blindfolds are common in this type of fantasy.

Submissions could be emotional or physical and may involve role-play - in some cases even going as far as pretending to be a rape victim or a sex slave.

EL James' erotic trilogy Fifty Shades Of Grey has been credited with more women enjoying the idea of a sexual experience that involved them being submissive towards a man

DOMINANT FANTASIES

When the roles are reversed and the man becomes the submissive to the female dominatrix. Role-play includes cheating on a partner and being in control of a sex slave.

With research suggesting it's very popular, and almost a third of people report having these fantasies at some point, the (sometimes literal ball-buster is a very popular role indeed.

The fantasy is about the woman being in control of what happens in bed and inflicting both pleasure and pain as she sees fit.

More and more women are relishing the idea of playing a dominatrix ordering around a submissive man in bed

EXHIBITIONISM AND VOYEURISM

Whether you're doing it in the garden, the park, on an aeroplane, in the stationery cupboard at work or simply beside an open window in your own home, the idea of being somewhere where you could get caught or even be watched is a big turn-on for women.

Indeed, women in the book talk about the secondary eroticism of watching others having sex, and the excitement of being intimate when you know for certain you are being watched.

The idea of watching people having sex or being watched yourself is one of the top turn-ons for women

With so much going on when you have sex as part of a group, many women relish the idea of being very, er, well-looked.

There is also an element of anonymity in some cases, or, if you are part of a couple, bringing something new, different and exciting into the bedroom.

For others the idea of experimenting with your sexuality by engaging intimately with a member of the same sex is where the fantasy lies.

Many women are aroused by the idea of having sex as part of a group, whether because they are keen to experiment with their sexuality or because they want to add another person's sexual nuances to the mix

Quite simply, the idea of having sex with a loving, exclusive partner really gets women hot under the collar.

Similarly, the idea of regular sex with a specific partner who is not your own is also a fantasy, for example a celebrity, a friend, or a work colleague crush.

Many women fantasise simply about regular sex with a partner - whether that partner is their own or one they like to dream about being intimate with
