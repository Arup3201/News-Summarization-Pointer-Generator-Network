UEFA President Michel Platini has expressed his fears that drones carrying bombs could could cause a disaster at football matches in the future.

The Frenchman was appalled after players, fans and officials became involved in a mass brawl when a drone stoked political tensions between Serbia and Albania by flying a pro-Albanian flag on to the pitch during their Euro 2016 qualifier on Tuesday.

English referee Martin Atkinson was eventually forced to abandon the game after Albania players feared for their safety as they were pelted by missiles as they fled from the fighting on the pitch.

Platini had already branded the incident 'inexcusable' but has added that future matches involving teams that share political tensions could present a serious problem to safety.  

'We opened an investigation. We will wait for the reports from Belgrade, but just imagine that the drone had carried a bomb instead of a flag,' Platini told TF1 .

'What would we do then?

'We must be careful, as everything is becoming dangerous, especially in the regions where there are a lot of political tensions, such as this one.'

After the game, Chelsea and Serbia defender Branislav Ivanovic admitted he could not understand how the incident became so out of hand, while Albania captain Lorik Cana blamed home supporters for the game being abandoned.
