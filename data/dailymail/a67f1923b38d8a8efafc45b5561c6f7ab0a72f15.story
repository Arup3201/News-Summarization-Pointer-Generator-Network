For the first time in a century, it seems people in the U.S. are leaving the suburbs for cities.

Since the invention of the automobile in 1888, the rate of suburban 
population growth has consistently outpaced that of urban centers. But in 2011 - for the first time in a hundred years - the trend reversed.

Demographics, environmental concerns and rising energy costs all play roles, according to The End of the Suburbs: Where the American Dream is Moving, a new book that charts the rise and fall of American suburbia.

End of the white picket fence? Since the invention of the automobile, the rate of suburban population growth has outpaced that of urban centers. But in 2011 - for the first time in a hundred years - the trend reversed

'Powerful 
social trends are shrinking and transforming the American nuclear 
family, long the dominant driver of suburbia,' wrote the author, Leigh Gallagher.

'Simply speaking, more 
and more Americans don’t want to live there anymore.'

Originally,  suburbs were quaint, tree-lined villages. But the post-World War II housing shortage, and low-interest loans for the middle class led to the suburban house becoming as much a part of the American Dream as two kids and a dog.

Moving

 out: Some experts say that the era of cookie-cutter suburban homes that have been iconic of the
 American dream since the 1950s may be 
over forever 

As suburbs grew, so to did 'a lack of cultural amenities', explains Ms Gallagher, who is also the Assistant Managing Editor of Fortune magazine. Suburbs, she says, lead to 'miles and miles of Ruby 
Tuesdays', and longer and longer commutes.

According to the U.S. 
Census Bureau, the average American takes 25.4minutes to get to work 
every day - and 10.8million face trips of more than an hour. 

But rising energy costs mean that for many people, these trips are becoming less economical. 

Battered by the job market, some young people - nicknamed 'Generation Rent' because they are, increasingly, delaying home ownership - are also choosing to settle in diverse urban areas.

Changing
 demographics: Since the 1950s the suburb system has depended on cars 
and highways, but now high energy costs are making long commutes 
unaffordable for many people

'Construction permit data shows 
that in several cities, building activity that was once concentrated in 
the suburban fringe has now shifted primarily to cities, or what 
planners call the "urban core"', Ms Gallagher writes.

House builders claim that McMansions are out, while condominiums, 
townhouses, and multi-family housing units that 
emphasize efficient use of space are the future. 

End of the Suburbs

'Gone are the master bathrooms you 
can land planes in,' said Boyce Thompson, the editorial director of the 
Builder group of magazines at the housing research and publishing firm 
Hanley Wood, said recently.

In 2012, the Builder magazine 'concept
 home' was a series of three homes, each sized to house a different 
generation. Gallagher writes that some suburbs will survive: Ironically,
 in many communities there is a movement for New Urbanism that creates 
more pedestrian-friendly areas.

But Robert Shiller, a 
Yale University economist and founder of the Case-Shiller Home Price 
Indices, says that the constant expansion of the past few decades could be over forever.

'Suburban prices may not recover in our
 lifetime,' he adds.

Whatever
 happens, Ms Gallagher believes that we will have more options. 'There 
is no single American Dream anymore,' she writes.

'There are multiple American Dreams, and multiple American Dreamers.'
