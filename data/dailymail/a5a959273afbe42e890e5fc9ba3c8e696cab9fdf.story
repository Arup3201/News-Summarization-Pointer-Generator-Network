The lead investigator in the case of missing William Tyrell says there are still 10 officers working full-time to find the three-year-old, four months after he first disappeared.

Superintendent Paul Fehon, from Port Macquarie LAC, said investigators were still committed to finding out what happened to William despite not finding any clues since he went missing on September 12 last year.

This comes as it was revealed William’s sister often asks 'Has anyone seen my little brother?'

It has been four months of agony for the three-year-old's family ever since he disappeared without a trace from his grandmother's backyard  in Kendall on the New South Wales mid north coast, while dressed in a Spider-Man costume.

Supt Fehon said investigators had recanvassed the area near where William was last seen in the past weeks, including searching a 1.5km radius with specialist cadaver dogs.

‘There is no indication of where he may be,’ Supt Fehon told Daily Mail Australia.

‘We’ve still got a dedicated team in excess of 10 analysts and investigators working full-time and they’re going to explore every possible avenue.

‘The main thing is going through the many hundreds of Crime Stoppers reports which have been received from the public and evaluating them, prioritising them and then being able to determine the value of the information.’

He said William's parents were being kept up to date with the investigation through what has been an ‘extremely difficult period’.

‘They’ve had to endure a Christmas without young William,’ he said.

‘They’ve indicated to me that words cannot describe their pai.

When William Tyrell's sister walks into a room, she often asks 'Has anyone seen my little brother?'

It has been four months of agony for the three-year-old's family ever since he disappeared without a trace from his grandmother's backyard in Kendall on the New South Wales mid north coast.

Police still have no leads as to his whereabouts, with extensive searches of the bushland around the property failing to uncover any clues. 

Kendall local Kay Dollery says William's four-year-old sister, who lives with their parents on Sydney's north shore, often asks after her brother.

Ms Dollery had William's Sydney neighbours stay with her when they travelled to Kendall to help during the initial week-long search in September.

'I've been to Sydney and had dinner with one of them and they said the sister keeps coming in and saying "Has anyone seen my little brother?"' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'It just brings you to tears.

Ms Dollery said the people of Kendall remained hopeful William would be found, but were devastated to have no clues four months to the day of his disappearance.

'Going through Christmas was pretty sad - the services club had William's Christmas tree which was beautiful - but I think [the mood] is just sombre as we know there is no change which is disheartening,' she said. 

'I think it comes down to the question of there's just been no sign of him and that's the baffling part of it, that there's no indication of where he is, there's no indication that he was taken he's just vanished.

'I think in real terms most people would have the opinion that someone's got him and then they just live in hope that whoever's got him is looking after him and hasn't done anything awful.'

This comes after it was revealed that homicide detectives are now leading the investigation into his disappearance, The Sunday Telegraph reported.

Superintendent Paul Fehon, from Port Macquarie Local Area Command, said Christmas was a difficult time for the family.

'They indicated to me that Christmas was just a quiet silent time at home, the emptiness of having a void in their house,' Supt Fehon told The Sunday Telegraph.

'That's been unopened presents, not able to share the festivities, to see a smile on young William's face to receive gifts or presents like any other normal child.'  

Supt Fehon said a lack of evidence to support the potential scenarios has left investigators baffled. 

For the first time he has also outlined a detailed account of the sequence of events before William's disappearance. 

His grandmother, mother and four-year-old sister were enjoying a relaxing morning on the driveway of his grandmother's property.  

Dressed in his favourite superhero costume, William was playing a game of hide-and-seek with his sister.

He was dashing around the side of the house before reappearing with a smile and returning to his his family.  

When he ran around out of view at about 10.25am on September 12, his mother did not check on him until 10.30am, when she went around the corner looking for him and he was nowhere to be seen.

Neighbours watched the family frantically scouring the area and calling out his name, before they contacted police shortly afterwards.  

One neighbour saw William’s distraught mother pacing the quite street after William went missing.

Afterwards, his father, who had been at the shops, returned and instantly joined into the search.

The family had visited Kendall before, with locals recalling seeing them the previous December.

Another neighbour said the community has been rocked by William’s disappearance, with children no longer allowed to ride their bikes or visit the local store without supervision.

In a major turn for the investigation, murder squad officers are now leading inquiries - meaning the case is no longer a missing persons investigation. 

Homicide Squad boss Detective Superintendent Michael Willing told the Sunday Telegraph that the investigation had taken a new direction.  

'We want to do a thorough investigation to determine what's happened to William and obviously we need to consider the worst case scenario,' Supt Willing said. 

A NSW police spokeswoman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that homicide detectives are now leading the investigation.  

'The homicide squad are involved to ensure thorough investigation but we have no evidence to suggest any particular scenario at this stage,' a police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia.

Detectives have spoken to every person they could locate who was in Kendall that day when the little boy disappeared at Benaroon Drive about 10.30am, five minutes after he was last seen by his grandmother and mother. He had been playing with his four-year-old sister.   

Detectives, who found no trace of William during an intense nine-day search and were concentrating their investigation on the theory that William was abducted, have previously described the case as 'astonishing'.

A huge search of surrounding properties and bushland failed to find a trace of the boy. 

One lead police have investigated is a report of a 'well-dressed, well-spoken' man who reportedly asked a local shopkeeper for directions to Batar Creek Road, which leads to Benaroon Drive, on the morning William disappeared. 

William's family thanked searchers for their hard work. 'Thank you does not seem like the right sort of word to express our gratitude and heartfelt warmth we feel towards each and every one of you,' a statement from the family said.

'We have been completely overwhelmed with the way the public, SES, Surf Life Saving, RFS and the Police have rallied together to find our little Spiderman William.'
