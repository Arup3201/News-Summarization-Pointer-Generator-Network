Germany is offering generous packages to entice young Britons to serve apprenticeships there.

In a twist on the 1980s TV comedy-drama Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, Angela Merkel’s administration wants to poach the cream of the UK’s young workers into the service of her country’s formidable industrial machine.

Berlin is launching a £120million drive to lure hundreds of Britons aged 18-35 on to all-expenses-paid, three-year apprenticeships with German firms to plug the skills gap in the EU’s most prosperous economy.

The hope is that many recruits will stay permanently in the country, which is worried about a looming lack of well-qualified workers because of its ageing population.

At 7.5 per cent, Germany’s youth unemployment rate is a fraction of that in the UK, where the proportion of jobless under-25s is just over 20 per cent, leaving almost a million youngsters looking for work.

The Germans see the recruitment drive as an altruistic offer of work to youngsters who are starved of opportunities at home. But it has inevitably led to fears they will cherry pick some the most gifted young Britons.

Candidates, who must be educated to A-level standard, are being offered a work-and-study package including wages of nearly £700 a month after tax plus 170 hours of free language lessons.

They will also receive relocation costs, two expenses-paid visits a year home, plus training at one of Germany’s highly-regarded vocational schools.

The German economic miracle – which for years attracted  building workers from Britain, including the hapless Geordies at the centre of Auf Wiedersehen, Pet – has so far survived the eurozone crisis but the country has 33,000 unfilled apprenticeships.

'British employers will have to try harder to get the best young apprentices as it is more competition'

Bob Bischof, of the German-British Chamber of Industry and Commerce, said: ‘This is a great offer for young Britons to get top-flight training in Germany.

'We hope many of those who come over will like the life, maybe meet a German partner, and stay for good. It means British employers will have to try harder to get the best young apprentices as it is more competition.’

Apprentices in Britain are paid a minimum of around £345 a month if under 19, though some employers pay more. This goes up to a minimum of £785 a month for those over 21.

Wulf Schroeter, of the International Business Academy, which is running the scheme in the UK, said: ‘Generally, the brightest youngsters don’t like to be unemployed. Therefore they wouldn’t leave their country if there are enough alternatives.

‘It’s the job of the governments everywhere to establish conditions for the economy to invest their money and create jobs.’
