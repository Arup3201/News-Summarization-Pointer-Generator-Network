Retailers are reporting a 45 per cent increase in sales of Prosecco compared to sales figures last year

Once reserved for special celebrations it seems we no longer require an occasion to pop open the bubbles.

Retailers are reporting a 45 per cent increase in sales of Prosecco compared to sales figures last year.

Marks & Spencer confirmed yesterday that they had sold 1.6million bottles of the sparkling wine compared to 1.1million over the same period last year.

More than that the store’s most popular brand of Prosecco – Conte Priuli priced £12 a bottle – has seen a sales increase of 268 per cent.

Another more affordable brand, the Prosecco Masottina which sells for £10 a bottle has seen an equally impressive sales jump of 55 per cent on last year.

As a result the supermarket has rushed to launch its first ever Prosecco Magnum in time for the holiday season, priced £20 a bottle.

Some wine experts believe the bubble boom has happened as shoppers increasingly look for something more special when purchasing a bottle of wine.

But M&S winemaker Jeneve Williams, said she believed the real reason behind the change is the great improvement in good quality affordable sparkling wines.

She said: ‘As our customers enjoy Prosecco more often and become increasingly knowledgeable they are seeking out better quality versions, which we believe is behind the great success of the Conte Priuli Prosecco this year.

‘This wine offers customers the opportunity to taste a great quality, delicious Prosecco, with elegant peach and honeysuckle aromas.’

But it’s not just M&S that have seen sales soar.

Research from drinks industry experts published earlier this year found that the UK sparkling wine industry as a whole saw sales shoot up by £70million last year making it by far the fastest growing sector in the drinks market.

Trade magazine The Drinks Business also reported that Prosecco had seen a 74.6% surge in UK sales over the past year alone.

The figure means that globally sales are now overtaking Champagne for the first time last year

Dror Nativ, M&S Wine Buyer, said: ‘The ongoing Prosecco boom has of course been fuelled by the affordability and approachability of this wine, but what is most interesting is the new trend for enjoying Prosecco as an everyday drink rather than solely on celebratory occasions.

‘Our customers are enjoying Prosecco midweek, at dinner parties with friends, or simply as a treat, and sales show no sign of slowing down.’
