Chelsea shouldn’t be keeping pace in this title race. With three forwards who have managed just eight league goals between them, they should be watching Manchester City disappear into the distance.

But Chelsea — the team I tipped for the title at the start of the season — are right in the thick of it because they have the ultimate big-game manager.

Do not underestimate how influential Jose Mourinho will be as the season reaches its climax.

Title favourites: Many are expecting Man City to run away with the league in the second half of the season

Showdowns like Sunday’s with Manchester United make Mourinho tick. He comes alive in the build-up and has a way of dominating the agenda. As an opposition player, it complicates things as you find yourself thinking about him as much as the players you have to stop in the game. 

I said on this page earlier in the season how I felt Mourinho was ‘The Different One’ but time has proved he is, in many respects, the same as when he first arrived here nine years ago.

Take what happened with Samuel Eto’o against Liverpool last month. Eto’o should have been sent off and should also have given a penalty away yet Mourinho managed to flip the post-match narrative to attack Luis Suarez’s diving and the number of former Liverpool players working in the media!

Mind games: Mourinho deflected attention away from Samuel Eto's apparent trip on Luis Suarez last month

The main similarity between the Mourinho of then and now comes from his ability to deliver in the season-shaping contests. When Chelsea won back-to-back titles during his first reign, his record against Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool was almost exemplary.

He knows what it takes to find a result when it matters and, over those first two campaigns, Chelsea took 29 points off their main rivals, winning nine and drawing two of the 12 games. You can see why he has won nine of the 12 major cup finals he has contested during his managerial career.

Mourinho is repeating the trick. Each time Chelsea have faced a defining match in the Premier League this year, Mourinho has come up with the right solution. Some will argue his teams are not always the most attractive but they are absolutely effective.

It started in his second match when he set up a team with no strikers to get a point at Old Trafford. A month later at White Hart Lane, the introduction of Juan Mata at half-time was the catalyst to turn a one-goal deficit into a 1-1 draw, even though Chelsea finished with 10 men.

He then coaxed a last-gasp 2-1 home win against Manchester City in October, flooded the midfield at Arsenal to get a 0-0 draw before Christmas then played to the gallery in the 2-1 win over Liverpool, whipping up the fans and inspiring his players.

That was always the thing about tackling Chelsea. You never felt like you were just facing 11 men — you felt you had to play him, too. Sir Alex Ferguson had a habit of appearing on the touchline at key moments and Mourinho is a master of that, too.

He also knows how to play mind games, which is why I smiled when I read his comments about how he had ‘heard’ things were ‘not happy’ at Old Trafford. There was also a casual remark that United are ‘out of the title race’.

Mourinho used to say things like that all the time about Liverpool. I remember him complaining about Chelsea not getting a penalty in the first leg of the Champions League semi-final in 2007 when Alvaro Arbeloa accidentally handled outside the area. Jose kept saying how he hoped Chelsea ‘wouldn’t be crying about another big  decision’ in the return.

He was relentless, so the only way to take him on was with humour. Before the second leg, I said he was the funniest thing to come out of London since Del Boy and Rodney.

Gearing up: Mourinho puts his players through their paces at Chelsea's Cobham training ground on Friday

We had Chelsea’s number then — we beat them in three semi-finals in three years — and the wins were extra special as he would have tried everything to grind you down. When he left in 2007, we felt even more confident about beating them, even though they were  essentially still his team.

Maybe Mourinho had a point to prove when he came back this  summer after the two Manchester clubs looked elsewhere for new  managers. But he is working like a man on a mission and whatever he is doing, it is working.

He has hardly made any changes to a squad that in the past two seasons finished 25 points then 14 points off the title winners, yet here they are bang in contention, just two points off the lead and  getting stronger.

Of course, they have some top performers. Joe Cole told me 18 months ago that Eden Hazard would blossom into a star and he has taken his game up a level after a slow start to the season.

Star in the making: Eden Hazard's game has come on since Mourinho took over at Stamford Bridge

If he maintains this vein of form, he could challenge Suarez when the individual honours are handed out later on.

Aside from inspiring Hazard, his handling of Mata — not selecting a crowd favourite — has been proved correct by results and the impact of Oscar and Willian. The biggest impact of all, however, has come from Mourinho.

Should Chelsea win tomorrow, Mourinho will have his 100th  Premier League victory. It would be symbolic, as his first came against United in 2004. It would be a record, too, as it would only have taken 141 matches to get there. For context, Ferguson needed 162; Arsene Wenger took 179 matches.

But, above all, it would also be ominous for Chelsea’s rivals. City might be exciting with all their goals but they can’t, for one moment, be considered title certainties.

Not when Mourinho’s influence remains stronger than ever.

Kick politics out of football

So, Cristiano Ronaldo won the Ballon d’Or but what we really saw at the glittering award ceremony in Zurich was the politics of the voting system laid bare.

Don’t think what happened is something new. In fact, I’d go as far as to say it happens at every club in the country when the PFA forms are handed out.

Put it this way: if Liverpool had someone
 in the running for the Player of the Year award, or the Young Player of
 the Year award, the ‘rule’ in the dressing room would be: Do not vote 
for any of their rivals.

Here is an example: Luis Suarez has an outstanding chance of winning the PFA award this season. Seeing as you can’t pick anyone from your own club, I wouldn’t expect any Liverpool player to choose Sergio Aguero, Eden Hazard or Aaron Ramsey as their selection.

I’m not saying Ronaldo didn’t deserve to win the Ballon d’Or for the second time, as he had an astonishing year and his consistency and endurance have been remarkable, but there should be a way of making the award even more significant.

Votes for the Ballon d’Or should be taken away from national coaches and captains and it should be left exclusively to journalists, as it used to be.

Liverpool’s game with Aston Villa this evening carries particular significance for me, as it is 17 years to the day since I marked my first start in a Red shirt with a goal in front of The Kop. It was a day I will never forget — we won 3-0 — and I’m sure the players I’ve picked out here would say the same.

1 Alan Shearer: One of the great strikers of the modern era served notice of what was to come when, on his full debut in April 1988 (below), he scored three for Southampton against Arsenal in a 4-2 win. Aged 17, he became the youngest player, at that time, to score a hat-trick in the top flight.

2 Wayne Rooney: We all knew Wayne would be a success when he went to Manchester United but nobody expected the startling impact he made in his first game in September 2004. He scored a hat-trick at Old Trafford in the 6-2 Champions League victory against Fenerbahce (below). 

3 Fabrizio Ravanelli: I remember the day Ravanelli introduced himself to English football in August 1996. I made the bench for the first time at the Riverside, it was a glorious day and a superb 3-3 draw. I’ll never forget the celebration — pulling his shirt over his head — after each of his three Middlesbrough goals.

4 Jurgen Klinsmann: There was a big buzz around the opening day in August 1994 and much of it was because Klinsmann had joined Tottenham. He didn’t disappoint at Sheffield Wednesday, scoring a header, celebrating with a dive (below) to mock his critics and inspiring a 4-3 win at Hillsborough.

5 Tony Cottee: Evertonians couldn’t wait to get a glimpse of Cottee after he arrived at Goodison Park for a British record £2.2million from West Ham in August 1988. That month he made a brilliant first impression, scoring three goals in a 4-0 win over Newcastle (below).

He dominates the build-up and gets in the heads of the opposition

City are by no means a title certainty as long as Mourinho is around
