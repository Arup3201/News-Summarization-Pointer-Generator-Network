Luke 'Sasha' Fleischman, the 'agender' teenager who was set on fire in an alleged hate crime on an LA bus

A 16-year-old Northern California boy is being charged as an adult with hate crimes after authorities say he set on fire another teenager wearing a skirt aboard a bus because of homophobia.

Alameda County prosecutors charged Richard Thomas, of Oakland, with felony assault and aggravated mayhem with hate crime enhancements in Monday's attack on Luke ‘Sasha’ Fleischman, who is hospitalized with second- and third-degree burns.

‘Richard Thomas' violent and senseless criminal conduct resulted in severe and traumatic injuries to a young and entirely innocent victim,’ District Attorney Nancy O'Malley said after charges were filed. ‘The intentional and callous nature of the crime is shocking and will not be tolerated in our community.’

Thomas didn't enter a plea during his arraignment Thursday. He was being held without bail and is due back in court November 12.

Thomas' mother, who identified herself only as Ms. Jackson, spoke to KGO-TV outside the courtroom.

‘I am very sorry for my son's actions. I did not raise him that way,’ she said, adding: ‘My son is not a hateful person. He's a kid, kids joke around.’

Thomas' mother added that her son regretted his actions and will write the victim a letter of apology.

The junior at Oakland High School was arrested at school Tuesday afternoon after surveillance video from a public bus helped police identify him as the suspected attacker.

Reckoning: Richard Thomas, 16, has been arrested and charged as adult with assault and aggravated mayhem with hate crime enhancements in attack on Fleischman

Motive: Thomas, seen here handcuffed during his arrest, allegedly told investigators that he set the agender teen alight because he was homophobic

Kids being kids: Thomas' relatives, pictured 
here in the courtroom, said that Richard is not a hateful person, that 
the incident was a 'joke,' and that he is sorry for his actions

Authorities say Thomas used a lighter 
to set Fleischman's kilt-like skirt on fire while Fleischman was asleep 
on an AC Transit bus in Oakland at around 5pm, authorities said.

Other passengers came to the 18-year-old's aid after he tried to put out the flames himself.

Once
the bus driver realized what happened, he stopped the bus and called 
for assistance but the suspect fled the scene before police arrived.

During
an interview with police, Thomas said ‘he did it because he was 
homophobic,’ Oakland police Officer Anwawn Jones wrote in a court 
affidavit.

Fleischman's 
mother and friends have said he identifies as ‘nonbinary,’ a designation
sometimes adopted by those who see themselves as gender-neutral.

Tiffany
Woods, a liaison between the transgender community and Oakland police, 
said Fleischman identified as gender neutral or ‘agender" and was a 
‘well-liked kid.’

Standout: Fleischman is a senior at the Maybeck High School in Berkeley, where the principal described the 18-year-old as a 'wonderful, exceptional student'

Gender-neutral: Friends refer to 'Sasha', pictured with his parents, as 'they,' them' and 'it'

Trevor 
Cralle, director of the Maybeck High School in Berkeley, where 
Fleischman is a senior, described the 18-year-old as a ‘wonderful, 
exceptional student.’

Sasha’s friend Eve Irwin told the Oakland Tribune that those who know the teen use the pronouns ‘they,’ ‘them’ or sometimes ‘it’ when referring to Fleischman.

Fleischman's parents said the 18-year-old is a straight-A student who is interested in public transportation and has his sights set on the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Fleischman, of Oakland, is a senior at a private high school in Berkeley. He remained in stable condition at a hospital in San Francisco, and his mother said he will require massive skin grafting.

Fleischman's relatives set up a fundraising page for him Tuesday on Fundly.com, with the hope of raising $20,000 in 10 days to go toward his medical bills. The site said Luke Fleischman requires ‘several surgeries.’

The goal was surpassed 24 hour later as more than 400 supporters donated more than $21,000.
