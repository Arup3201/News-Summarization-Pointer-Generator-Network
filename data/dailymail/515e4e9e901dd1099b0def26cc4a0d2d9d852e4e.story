Delays were continuing on the M25 this morning more than 30 hours after a fatal crash which has seen two men placed under arrest in hospital.

Yesterday, thousands of drivers were trapped in eight miles of tailbacks after a man died in the 'catastrophic' four-lorry pile-up on one of the busiest stretches of the motorway.

The victim, believed to have been a 39-year-old from Leicester, was found dead at the scene and three more were injured when a lorry ploughed through the central reservation in Essex.

Drivers were stuck in eight miles of tailbacks, pictured yesterday, after a fatal crash on the M25 near to Waltham Abbey, on one of the busiest stretches of motorway 

Today, one lane still remained closed in each direction between junctions 26 and 27 at Waltham Abbey causing delays again this morning for drivers.

The Highways Agency confirmed today that both lanes were closed while emergency repair work was carried out to the central reservation, which was damaged in yesterday's smash.

It has been reported that at least 40 metres of the barrier will need to be rebuilt following the crash and lane four of the carriageway in both directions may need to be closed for several days.

They also added that drivers travelling in both directions could expect delays of around 10 minutes, with the slow moving traffic stretching for up to two miles. 

Meanwhile, Essex Police said they were still waiting to question two men who were arrested but were still being treated in hospital following the crash.

The men, aged 33 and 25, have been arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving.

Crash: Police said the motorway, pictured early yesterday morning was a 'catastrophic scene of carnage' and the road was closed for 13 hours

The central reservation was damaged yesterday after the crash and emergency works were taking place today to repair it 

Motorists were left trapped and some vehicles ended up on the wrong side of the carriageway after the crash yesterday at 1.50am near to Waltham Abbey.

The aftermath then forced the M25 to be closed between junctions 25 and 27 for more than 13 hours causing traffic chaos.

Drivers stuck in the traffic said the queues were so bad a journey usually lasting around 20 minutes took up to four hours.

The road could only partially open at 3pm after Chief Inspector Jonathan Baldwin, of Essex Police, said the road was a 'catastrophic scene of carnage'.
