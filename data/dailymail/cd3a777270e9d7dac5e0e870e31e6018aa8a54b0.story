Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, hinted the Government may channel money saved from departmental budgets into infrastructure projects

Ministers are to pump billions of pounds into big infrastructure projects after being urged to boost growth by the International Monetary Fund.

In a speech last night, Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, indicated that Chancellor George Osborne will funnel cash from day-to-day departmental budgets into major building projects.

In a speech to the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, Mr Alexander vowed to ‘stick to the path we are on’ economically and rejected Labour’s calls for more borrowing to fund investment.

But he said: ‘We will continue to show flexibility wherever it is needed, and to shift resources wherever we can to support economic growth.’

He added: 'For key areas of capital 
expenditure - like infrastructure - we intend to make commitments right 
through to the end of the decade.'

Mr Alexander stressed that the Treasury was taking a ‘zero-based approach’ to capital projects in the spending review, requiring departments to show that every scheme they propose will generate economic benefits.

He said: ‘When we took such an approach in 2010, it resulted in the most economically important areas being prioritised.

'So investment in transport, for example, was not just protected from cuts, its budget was actually increased in every year, which has enabled us to commit to crucial projects like High Speed 2.’

Danny Alexander said the Coalition has shown its willingness to invest in infrastructure projects by committing to HS2 railway

His comments suggest the government is listening to the IMF, which last week called for ministers to shift current spending into infrastructure projects to boost growth in the economy.

But Labour Treasury spokesman Chris Leslie accused the government of dragging its feet.

He said: ‘George Osborne has invested billions less in infrastructure than the plans he inherited, meaning housebuilding is at record lows and the construction sector is shrinking.

‘Ministers should listen to the IMF, which said that infrastructure investment must be brought forward right now. Decisive action this year would not only create jobs and growth now but strengthen our economy for the long-term. Major infrastructure projects have also been beset by dithering and delay.’
