An interpreter was not sent to translate for a murder suspect - because the company said it was 'not worthwhile as they will not make enough money'.

Judge Julian Flaux blasted the decision not to send a mandarin translator for Anxiang Du, 53, which forced him to adjourn the case for two months.

Du had been due to answer four charges of murder at Nottingham Crown Court today.

Judge Julian Flaux (left) slammed the unnamed company for not sending a translator to the court for Du's (right) hearing

He is accused of killing university 
lecturer Jifeng 'Jeff' Ding, his wife Ge 'Helen' Chui and their two 
daughters Alice, 12, and Xing, 18, on April 29 2011.

An international search was mounted for Du after the family were found stabbed to death at their home in the quiet suburb of Wootton, Northampton.

He was eventually arrested in Tangier in July last year after a 15-month manhunt which saw police travel to China in pursuit of the fugitive.

But the case had to be adjourned and a trial date which was originally scheduled for August had to be put back until November after the interpreter failed to turn up.

Because of the company, the judge had to delay the hearing at Nottingham Crown Court by two months

Mr Justice Flaux told the court he didn't know which company was involved, but that they had chosen not to send an interpreter despite repeat requests to do so.

He fumed: 'The company, I don't know which one, said it was not worthwhile sending and interpreter as they will not make enough money.

'They were asked to provide mandarin interpreter at two, they said it wouldn't be worthwhile, they were asked again and said one would be here at 2.30, they were told to be here for two and they haven't turned up.

'It would be completely unfair on Mr Du to go ahead without an interpreter.

'I will be asking for a written explanation to explain what has happened, then consider costs.

'It is a complete disgrace, some people suggest things have got better, that depends what the starting point is.'

Du, who is in custody, will now appear at Northampton Crown Court on July 19 for a plea and case management hearing.
