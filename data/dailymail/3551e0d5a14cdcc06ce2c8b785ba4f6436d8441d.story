The funeral of Newcastle United fan Liam Sweeney, the first British victim to be identified from the wreckage of Flight MH17, is taking place this morning.

Family and friends arrived under gloomy skies to commemorate the life of the 28-year-old, who had been travelling to New Zealand to watch his team play. 

They were joined at St Mary's Cathedral, Newcastle, by manager Alan Pardew, club captain Fabricio Coloccini, managing director Lee Charnley and assistant manager John Carver.

Afterwards they were seen greeting and hugging the family, including Mr Sweeney's father Barry, and passing on their condolences.

He is the first British victim to be laid to rest.

Pictures inside the order of service show Mr Sweeney when he was a boy and in his Newcastle kit. 

The  ceremony opened with the hymn Jerusalem and the service was held by Father Dermott Donnelly - the brother of TV presenter Declan Donnelly.

The priest welcomed Liam's family and friends as well as the representatives of Newcastle United and Sunderland football clubs.

He also welcomed the family of John Alder, whose body has not been found yet.

He told the hundreds of mourners how Liam was a 'gentle young boy who became a giant gentle man.'

He also told how Liam had a love of music, especially rock music, reading and the Simpsons and also told them how his hero was late Newcastle United footballer Gary Speed.

'Liam deserves his place in Geordie mythology. It is fitting Liam's body was brought into the cathedral to local hero.'

Prayers were also said for the family of Mr Alder, asking that his family would have peace at this time.  

A tearful rendition of a poem was read out in the cathedral, which included the words: 'If the Toon were playing you were there, win or lose through bad and good, Newcastle United were in your blood.'

The cortege stopped in the shadow of St James Park before making its way to Newcastle Crematorium following the church service. 

Flight MH17 was shot down on July 17 over eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 aboard. 10 of the victims were from the UK.

After the crash hundreds of tributes and flowers were left outside St James' Park for Mr Sweeney and John Alder, a fellow supporter who had been travelling on the doomed flight with him.

Before today's funeral, Liam Sweeney's family received a personal letter from Prince Charles.

The letter, addressed to Liam's father Barry Sweeney, 52, reads: 'Although I'm afraid this is rather belated, my wife and I just wanted you to know how very much our hearts go out to you following the truly unimaginable tragedy of the loss of your son, Liam, on board flight MH17.

'You can have no idea how deeply we feel for you and your family over the unbearable anguish you are having to endure.

'I fear that under such appalling and shocking circumstances mere words are hopelessly and utterly inadequate.

'So although we realise only too well that it will be of no comfort whatsoever, all we can do is to hold you in our most special thoughts and prayers at such an agonising time.'

Mr Sweeney, who is a full-time carer to wife Lesley, 53, said: 'It's such a nice touch. I can't believe this has gone right to the top.

'We are making a memory box for Liam and the letter will be put in there.'
