Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has told David Cameron he is not going anywhere in a wider than expected Government reshuffle due next week.

A string of big names in the Cabinet are expected to be axed or moved in the last shake-up by the Prime Minister before next year’s general election.

Some of the older men in the Cabinet dubbed ‘the old lags’ will be sacked or will announce their retirements after long stints in Cabinet.

Overhaul: Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has told David Cameron he is not going anywhere during next week's reshuffle. Work and Pensions minister Esther McVey has been tipped for a position 

Veteran minister Kenneth Clarke is expected to go, as is Chief Whip Sir George Young and leader of the Commons Andrew Lansley.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles is also said to be vulnerable, along with Environment Secretary Owen Paterson and Welsh Secretary David Jones.

The Prime Minister wants to make way for fresh faces, most of them women.

Schools minister Elizabeth Truss and Work and Pensions minister Esther McVey are hotly tipped to enter the Cabinet.

Mr Duncan Smith has been at the centre 
of repeated speculation that he is being lined up for a ‘job swap’ with 
Defence Secretary Philip Hammond.

Allies of Mr Duncan Smith – who is overseeing the most fundamental reform of the welfare state for half a century – said he had no intention of leaving his post.

‘He and Cameron have agreed – he’s not going anywhere,’ said a source.

Other rising stars, including backbencher Priti Patel and whip Amber Rudd, are in line for more junior ministerial posts. Nicky Morgan and Penny Mordaunt are also being touted for promotion.

David Cameron is expected to put the finishing touches to his cabinet reshuffle this weekend - and it is expected to be more extensive than first though.

Here are some of the key figures expected to either make way for fresh faces, move to different departments or climb the ministerial ladder in the shake-up, which will be announced on Monday or Tuesday.

Iain Duncan Smith has told allies he has no intention of leaving his post

Iain Duncan Smith

Current position: Pensions Secretary.

There have been rumours that he could face the sack following a series of disputes with Chancellor George Osborne. Mr Duncan Smith has told allies he has no intention of leaving the post.

Kenneth Clarke

Current position: Minister without Portfolio.

The veteran MP is said to be one of a number of high-profile ministers expected to be vulnerable in the shake-up.

Eric Pickles

Current position: Communities Secretary

Another said to be vulnerable in the reshuffle, although one MP has predicted that he could become chief whip.

Sir George Young

Current position: Chief Whip

There has been speculation that he could be moved on and replaced by Eric Pickles, the Communities Secretary.

Andrew Lansley

Current position: Leader of the Commons

Could be another to make way for new faces in David Cameron's new Cabinet.

Philip Hammond

Current position: Defence Secretary

He has been at the centre of speculation linking him to a possible job swap with Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith.

Tipped for promotion: Esther McVey could be handed a spot in the cabinet after impressing with assured television appearances

Owen Paterson

Current position: Environment Secretary

Rumoured to be vulnerable in the shake-up.

David Jones

Current position: Welsh Secretary

The MP for Clwyd West is also said to be vulnerable in David Cameron's reshuffle.

Esther McVey

Current position: Pensions minister

Wirral West MP is hotly tipped for a place in David Cameron's new Cabinet after impressing with assured television appearances recently.

Elizabeth Truss

Current position: Schools minister

The MP for South West Norfolk is widely expected to join Esther McVey in being handed a Cabinet post.

Liam Fox

Current position: MP for North Somerset

The former Defence Secretary is being considered for a return to Government, according to some sources.

Mark Harper

Current position: MP for Forest of Dean

The former Minister of State for Immigration is another thought to be in line for a return to the Cabinet from the back benches

Former Cabinet minister Liam Fox and 
former immigration minister Mark Harper are being considered for a 
return to Government, sources say. Their names are also in the frame for
 a new chief whip.

One MP said he expected Mr Pickles to 
become chief whip, Culture Secretary Sajid Javid to move to Communities 
and Local Government, and Miss McVey to enter the Cabinet at culture.

Mr Cameron has been stung by claims that he has a ‘women problem’.

The
 desire to promote more women is designed to counter this impression and
 meet a pledge that a third of government members should be female.

One minister said the reshuffle was being drawn up by the all-powerful Chancellor. ‘This is George Osborne’s reshuffle, as always.

'That creates its own dynamics and its own problems.

'If you are looking at weak links, Lansley is possibly the weakest of all.

‘There are problems with trying to elevate all these women for PR reasons,’ the minister added.

‘Promoting people who have been in Parliament for five minutes into the Cabinet will backfire.’

Of
 the prospect of Mr Duncan Smith being shifted, the minister said it 
would be ‘hard to turn down defence – a dream job for most’.

Mr Duncan Smith has clashed in the past with the Chancellor, who wants to cut billions more from the welfare budget in the next Parliament.

Mr Osborne was said to have been behind the botched attempt to move the Work and Pensions Secretary to justice in 2012.

Mr Duncan Smith has been under pressure in recent months over delays to his flagship welfare reform, which will combine separate benefits into one ‘Universal Credit’.

The reshuffle is expected to take place next Monday or Tuesday, before the Commons summer recess.

Possible candidate: Theresa Villiers, Northern Ireland Secretary has been suggested for the role

David Cameron is considering putting forward a woman to take one of Europe’s top jobs.

He was said to be looking for a suitable female candidate to be Britain’s next EU Commissioner amid hints from Jean-Claude Juncker, the newly-elected President of the European Commission, that women will get the best jobs.

Among possible candidates for the role are Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers and former Sunday Telegraph editor Patience Wheatcroft.

There have even been calls for Home Secretary Theresa May to be offered the Brussels role.

Miss Villiers was a member of the European Parliament between 1999 and 2005, during which time she served as deputy leader of the Conservative group. If she is given the job she would have to resign as an MP, sparking a by-election in her marginal North London seat.

Baroness Wheatcroft, a former financial journalist who was appointed a Tory peer in 2010, may therefore be a safer bet because she would not force a by-election.

There have also been rumours that the British Commissioner job could go to Michael Howard, the former Tory leader and Home Secretary while others have suggested Michael Fallon, a minister in the business and energy departments.

Others in the frame include Defence Secretary Philip Hammond and Environment Secretary Owen Paterson.

The current British representative in Europe is Labour peer Baroness Cathy Ashton, whose job is EU foreign policy chief.

Negotiations on which post the UK will be assigned will begin in Brussels on Wednesday, just days after Mr Cameron’s Cabinet reshuffle.
