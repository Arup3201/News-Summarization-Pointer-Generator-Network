Fit-again Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge is confident he can forge a successful partnership with Mario Balotelli as the club look to secure Champions League football next season.

Sturridge made his first Premier League start since August in Liverpool's 3-2 win against top-four rivals Tottenham on Tuesday night, but it was former Manchester City striker Balotelli that stole the headlines.

The 24-year-old Italy striker came off the bench, replacing Sturridge, and scored the winner for Brendan Rodgers' side - his first Premier League strike since joining the Anfield club last summer from AC Milan.

Balotelli's best game for Liverpool came alongside Sturridge at White Hart Lane on his debut last August and the 25-year-old believes they can combine as a pair going forward.

Sturridge said: 'He's been waiting for a while to break his duck and been working very hard in training, and now he has scored one in the league I am sure things will start to go his way now.

'For me it's always about trying to help players who are here, not just Mario, but all the boys who are at the club. It's not easy to settle into a new team, a new area, a new lifestyle, with different people around you and so on and so forth. 

'People don't ever take that into account. I just try to do my bit, although I'm not taking any credit for him scoring – I'm just happy he did.'

Sturridge added: 'Whatever team the manager chooses to put out I will do my best whoever I have a partnership with. I try to adapt to whoever I am playing with and bring out the best in each other, and we (me and Mario) click when we are playing together.'

'But it is not just about me trying to do what I do - in the Tottenham game (in August) I played a little bit differently to how I did on Tuesday.

'I know Philippe Coutinho likes to thread balls through so I had to play on the shoulder a bit more.

'With Mario I can move around and go into wide areas because I know he will occupy the centre-halves.

'You play differently with different players and I am sure we will strike up a partnership in the future, I have no doubts about that.
