Film star Al Pacino was last night honoured by Barack Obama for his 'signature intensity as an actor'.

The 71-year-old star of The Godfather and Scarface was among 17 poets, historians, groups and others honoured at a glittering White House ceremony for contributions to the arts or humanities.

Former poet laureate Rita Dove, country music star Mel Tillis and classical pianist André Watts were also given the 2011 National Medal of Arts, while others received the National Humanities Medal.

‘Mr Pacino is an enduring and iconic figure, who came of age in one of the most exciting decades of American cinema, the 1970s,’ the award citation read at the East Room ceremony on Monday said.

‘His signature intensity as an actor was originally honed for the stage, under the tutelage of Lee Strasberg, and he has become one of the most outstanding and accomplished American artists.’

President Obama said: ‘We are told we are divided as a people, then suddenly the arts have the power to bring us together’. He thanked the recipients for ‘bringing new possibilities to all of us’.

The Commander-in-Chief drew applause when he said that the arts and humanities would remain a priority while he was President. He was joined at the ceremony by First Lady Michelle Obama.

‘The arts and humanities do not just reflect America - they shape America,’ President Obama said. ‘As long as I'm president, I look forward to making sure they are a priority for this country.’

Mr Tillis, 79, whose hits include ‘Coca-Cola Cowboy’ and ‘Good Woman Blues,’ won the arts award for his music contributions. The singer overcame a stutter to record more than 60 albums and has written more than 1,000 songs.

The other arts honourees were painter and printmaker Will Barnet, art curator and philanthropist Emily Rauh Pulitzer, sculptor Martin Puryear and military morale non-profit group United Service Organizations.

The winners of the National Humanities Medal included Princeton University philosophy professor Kwame Anthony Appiah, Pulitzer Prize poet John Ashbery and pianist and author Charles Rosen.
