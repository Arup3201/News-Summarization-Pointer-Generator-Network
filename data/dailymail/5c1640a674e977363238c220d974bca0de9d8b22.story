A street cleaning firm believes it could find £1million of precious metals among rubbish from Britain's streets.

Veolia Environmental Services is to sift through its street sweepings in search of fragments of gold and silver, which can rub off jewellery, shoes and clothing.

The company will also look for traces of palladium, platinum and rhodium, which are used in a car's catalytic converter and can fall out of exhaust pipes.

Veolia is to sift through Britain's rubbish in search of precious metals

Veolia, which sweeps up 165,000 tons of rubbish from the street every year, has now set up Britain's first plant to mine for metal, reports the Sunday Telegraph.

Richard Kirkman, the firm's technical director, told the newspaper: 'In the past we have always sent our street sweeping to landfill or compost sites.

'We
wanted to find something to do with this material, so we are separating
everything out with flotation tanks and mechanical sorting machines.

'We
are left with this fine black dust and we have found palladium, rhodium
and platinum at levels they are found in the ore when it is mined from 
the ground.'

Up to 1.5 tons of platinum, 1.3 tons of palladium and 0.8 tons of rhodium could be found every year in the 40 towns and cities where Veolia holds cleaning contracts, it is believed.

Platinum and palladium are prized for jewellery, with platinum also being used in electronic equipment and palladium in fuel cells.

The practice of panning for gold began in Mumbai in India in sewage pipes outside goldsmith's houses.

In 2011, Raffi Stepanian claimed he can make $800 (£530) a week from precious metals found on the streets in New York's diamond district.

Many of the fragments are carried out into the street by gold and gem merchants, who accidentally pick it up on their clothes.

Mr Stepanian also finds tiny chips of platinum, gold earring backs and loops from broken necklaces, watches and chains, all of which have been dropped by mistake.

His daily treasure hunt started several years ago, when he was working as a stone setter and found gold scraps on the floor of a diamond exchange.

He realised if he could find gold inside, it must be outside too - so he started scouring the sidewalks.

Mr Stepanian told the New York Post: 'The stones are already cut and manufactured - it's a step above a mine. I'm finding them already cut and polished.'
