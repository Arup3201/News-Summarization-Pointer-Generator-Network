England’s tour Sri Lanka has barely begun, yet Alastair Cook and coach Peter Moores have already found themselves on the defensive after the controversial decision to leave Alex Hales out of the opening warm-up game in Colombo.

With Hales, ranked third in the ICC’s Twenty20 batting table, left out of the top three in favour of Cook, Moeen Ali and Ian Bell for Friday’s 50-over match against Sri Lanka A, England once more stood accused of the kind of conservative thinking that many fear could condemn them to another World Cup flop in Australia and New Zealand next year.

And while Cook insisted England were ‘nowhere near’ identifying his opening partner, there is a concern among the coaching staff that Hales was exposed by India’s bowlers during his four one-day internationals at the end of the summer.

Those games brought him only 92 runs and a modest strike-rate of 68, and Moores explained: ‘India started to bring the ball back into Alex and bowl spin at him, so he has to decide what else he is going to come back at them with.’

Cook, meanwhile, did his best to leave the door open. ‘It was incredibly hard to pick a side even for this warm-up game,’ he said. ‘We just wanted another bowler in top six, and Moeen gives us that option. But we’re nowhere near making our final decision.’

Even so, England’s refusal to hit the home bowlers with their heaviest artillery at the earliest possible opportunity will do little to dissuade critics that their one-day game has fallen badly behind the rest of the world.

No innings by an England batsman this year was more breathtaking than Hales’s 64-ball 116 not out against the Sri Lankans during the World Twenty20 in Bangladesh, and there are worries that a top three of Cook, Ali and Bell will stagnate too easily.

Not for the first time, Moores was left to defend his captain’s role as opener, which has not produced a score above 80 in his last 39 innings.

‘We know he’s a steely character and a very good player,’ said the England coach. ‘If you take his record from the last World Cup, he’s still in the top 10 batters in the world over that period of time, in terms of runs scored.’

Cook is, in fact, 12th in that table. Of the 11 above him, only two – the Pakistan duo of Mohammad Hafeez and Misbah-ul-Haq – have a lower strike-rate than his 80. And none have hit fewer than his eight sixes.

In Alastair Cook's last 39 one-day innings as an opener, the England captain has not scored above 80. 

But England are refusing to be influenced by the global trend for higher one-day totals, stunningly exemplified last week when India’s Rohit Sharma made a world-record 264 against Sri Lanka in Kolkata.

‘Scores in India are always higher and you’ve got to accept that,’ said Moores. ‘We’re going to play a tournament in Australia and if you ask the stats man what a good score is, some places it would be 300 and at others it wouldn't be.

‘We’re playing matches in New Zealand, where 300 isn’t a normal score. We’re trying to get a batting unit that scores above par on a given surface. To do that, it is not as simple as saying to guys, “Go out there and whack it”.’

The Sri Lankans, who are hoping to build on their Test and one-day wins in England in May and June, may not be able to believe their luck.
