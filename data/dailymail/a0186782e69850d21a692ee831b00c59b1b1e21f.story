Britain's canal network is at risk of being ravaged by the Government’s controversial High Speed 2 rail line, campaigners warned yesterday.

The Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) says the tranquillity of some of Britain’s most idyllic waterways – and canal boat holidays enjoyed by thousands of people each year – will be destroyed by train noise and ugly concrete viaducts built as part of the project. 

The group has identified more than a dozen historic canals threatened by the building of the HS2 rail line from London to Birmingham and the proposed extension to Leeds and Manchester.

Ugly and noisy: What HS2 might look like crossing a peaceful canal in the British countryside, speeding past and creating a cacophony in the once peaceful canal network

These include picturesque Fradley Junction, where the Coventry and Trent and Mersey Canals meet, and neglected waterways such as the Sheffield and Tinsley Canal, which features in the film The Full Monty.

The CPRE has called on the Government to move the line away from the canals in its response to the consultation on the proposed Birmingham to Leeds section, which closed on Friday.

A spokesman said: ‘Nowhere in the consultation material have they considered the combined impact of all of HS2’s route on the canal network. The CPRE is calling for the route to be changed so it does not get in the way of canals and, where it crosses them, for viaducts to be designed so they fit in with the local scenery.’

Gren Messham, campaigns manager at the Inland Waterways Association, said: ‘These trains are very noisy – between 90 and 100 decibels. Where the rail lines have to cross a canal, HS2 Ltd needs to get better at reducing the noise.’

There are major concerns about the waterways at Fradley Junction, Staffordshire, a conservation area and tourist hotspot.

The owner of the local Swan pub, Richard O’Kane, 51, said: ‘HS2 will be cutting across the canal and taking this beautiful and highly photographed landmark away from us. I see HS2 as a big threat.’

But in Sheffield, where the local canal has been derelict for years, Gordon Lambert, managing director of narrowboat company Calder Valley Marine, said: ‘The new rail link can only have a good effect. It will bring much-needed prosperity.’

Ben Ruse, spokesman for HS2 Ltd, said: ‘Building a railway that will create thousands of jobs and free up capacity on the country’s rail network is a challenging business, so it is vital we maintain meaningful dialogue with all parties around HS2. It is inevitable that HS2 will cross over a number of waterways along the line of the route. 

‘The plans set out in the Environmental Statement accommodate extensive environmental mitigation and are the results of the largest public consultation and engagement scheme ever undertaken in the UK. People have until 27 February to submit their views on the environmental statement.’

The intricate system of canals in Britain would be crisscrossed by the HS2 network, which people are arguing would be a terrific eyesore to the countryside
