It may be an unsightly 1960s concrete building derided by critics as 'monstrous' and 'inhuman'.

But this Brutalist home in central London has gone on the market for a staggering £8.5million. 

The three-bedroom property in Hornton Street, Kensington, is commanding such a whopping fee as it includes two parking spaces, as well as a swimming pool and sauna.

This 1960s concrete house in Kensington has gone on the market for the staggering sum of £8million - the average UK salary is £26,500

Brutalist buildings have been described as 'inhuman' and 'hideous' and do not age gracefully, but this house is in a prime location

A lift services each floor of the three-bedroom house in Hornton Street, Kensington, there is a swimming pool and spa on the ground floor

Built in 1969 by the practice of Gollins Melvin Ward, for one of the partners, the house was given an interior make-over by architects Sauerbruch Hutton when acquired for the current owners. 

There is a swimming pool and spa on the ground floor, with windows folding away to connect the pool to the terrace and garden. 

A lift services each floor and the master bedroom suite occupies the majority of the second floor.

But the real draw is the two parking spaces, a rare perk in the affluent borough of Kensington and Chelsea.

Alan Russell, of estate agents Russell Simpson, said: 'Residents' parking permits are like gold dust in Kensington and Chelsea.

'They play an enormous part in the decision-making process of the majority of buyers, so to have two parking spaces Kensington and Chelsea is unusual and can make the house even more desirable.

'Located in ultra-prime Kensington, between two parks and with elevated, leafy views, this sunny, elegant, detached house is both practical and sensual, a real masterpiece of 20th century design.'

But the 1960s designs have attracted vocal critics, including Prince Charles who likened them to 'piles of concrete'. 

Author Theodore Dalrymple has also described them as 'cold-hearted', 'inhuman', 'hideous', and 'monstrous'.

Across London as a whole, the average home is now worth more than half a million pounds, according to the latest Land Registry figures.

The average price in Greater London is currently £523,953. This is compared to the average house price in of £177,766 in the rest of the country. 

The most expensive road in the capital, Kensington Palace Gardens, has an average house price of £42.7million. 

London has more homes over the £1million mark than the rest of the UK combined. In Kensington and Chelsea, the typical property price tag is currently £1.28million. 

It is not only flats that are up for grabs. In July last year, a row of three 1950s garages near Wandsworth Common sold for £500,000 - four times the guide price - after an auction bidding frenzy. 

In May, six garages in affluent Parsons Green sold for £700,000.

And in April, a run-down garage next to south London industrial estate, Vanguard Court, off Peckham Road, went for £550,000 after a bidding war.

The brick-built former coach house was used for years to park the Mayor of Southwark's car.

Parking spaces have also boomed in price, with a single space offered in a car park under the Royal Albert Hall in Kensington, west London, for £400,000.
