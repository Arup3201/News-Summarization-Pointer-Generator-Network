Disturbing similarities are being drawn between Breaking Bad and one of Australia's states as Victoria battles an ice epidemic.

Victorian parliamentary drug committee member David Southwick says the show could become a reality, reported the ABC.

This comes after recent studies show deaths from methamphetamines have more than doubled within five years as Victorian drug users increasingly turn to ice.

Mr Southwick says Breaking Bad, which featured science teacher Walter White who produces and sells methamphetamine to fund his cancer treatment, is 'coming to life'.

'Breaking Bad, that is being held up as sensationalised is effectively playing out on our streets,' he said.

Victoria recorded 166 deaths where methamphetamines were a factor last year, up from 66 in 2009.

A report from A Current Affair on Wednesday showed how a young mum who had just been tested positive to methamphetamine.

She stood with her child at her hip after being caught driving a car under the influence whilst on a busy Victorian road.

But police say the 32-year-old's case isn't one that's isolated as she is among many ice-using drivers being busted every day in Victoria.

A parliamentary inquiry also found related ambulance call-outs, and emergency department presentations, surged alongside the rising popularity of ice.

'The purity of crystal methamphetamine has also increased over the past two years, which exaggerates the drug's harmful effect,' Simon Ramsay, chair of the Law Reform, Drugs and Crime Prevention Committee, said on Wednesday.

'It's a drug that takes no prisoners in terms of its addictiveness.'

The committee's report says just two per cent of the Victorians use methamphetamines and, among this group, men aged 20 to 29 were most likely to be using ice.

Overdose, suicide and fatal road crashes were the most common causes of death for ice users.

The ice problem was not confined to metropolitan areas, with rural towns also showing big increases in related harms.

Glamorisation in the media was also a factor, Mr Southwick said, pointing to ice's role in Breaking Bad.

'It has been built up by television shows like Breaking Bad, and there is almost a hero-type mentality around it,' Mr Southwick said.

'We need to send a very clear message out to the community that this drug is a dirty drug, and it is being marketed quite the opposite even by its name.'

The Victorian government is considering the report's 54 recommendations, which include mirroring a successful New Zealand initiative to set up a premier-led ministerial council on ice.

Premier Denis Napthine announced $4.5 million funding to roll out roadside drug testing capability to all highway patrol cars in Victoria, and $1.6 million to train up 11 additional drug sniffer dogs.

The inquiry described the synthetic substances the most potent of the amphetamine class of drugs which consequently has a stronger effect on the central nervous system.

'It is generally stronger, more addictive and has more harmful side effects than the powder form of the drug known as 'speed',' the report said.
