Bill O'Reilly has remained a controversial voice in the aftermath of a grand jury deciding not to indict Darren Wilson in the shooting death of Michael Brown, but on Monday the anchor went so far he even manged to alienate a fellow Fox News contributor. 

Remarking on a group of St. Louis Rams players who adopted a 'hands up, don’t shoot' stance in a show of solidarity for Ferguson protesters prior to Sunday's game, O'Reilly said on The O'Reilly Factor; 'Quite frankly, I don’t think they’re smart enough to know what they’re doing.'

He then added again, 'I absolutely don’t think they’re smart enough to know what they’re doing.'

Protest: Five members of the St. Louis Rams adopted a 'hands up, don't shoot' stance before taking the field on Sunday in a show of support for the protesters in Ferguson

Speaking out: Bill O'Reilly said on his show Monday that the players weren't 'smart enough to know what they were doing' and that they were propagating a lie 

He went on to say the men were propagating the lie that Brown's hands were raised at the time he was shot. 

Not agreeing at all with this statement however was Mary Katharine Ham, a regular Fox News contributor, who seemed disgusted with what O'Reilly had to say.

Ham said she thought that the players 'non-violent' protest was fine, and then later defended her comments on Twitter, saying, 'Thing is I DON’T CARE if NFL players make displays w/ which I disagree. Not being as upset as you doesn’t mean I betrayed America.'

Fox News analyst Juan Williams, also a guest on Monday, disagreed with O'Reilly as well, and his take away that the football players were somehow coming out against all police.

'Look, you’ve got crazy people on all sides, Bill,' said Williams.

'But if you think that those football players identify and say, "Oh, all cops are bad"? That is not true.'

On Sunday, St. Louis Rams players Stedman Bailey, Jared Cook, Chris Givens, Tavon Austin and Kenny Britt took to the field making the same gesture many protesters have been making across the country these past two weeks.

This as crowds gathered outside the stadium during the game chanting 'Hands up, don't shoot!'

It seems that even Fox News may have had a problem with O'Reilly's statement, as they took down the clip after posting it earlier in the day on Tuesday.

O'Reilly has been very vocal about his disdain for Ferguson protesters, saying that even those who did not loot or set buildings on fire should still be considered criminals for continuing to protest as these events happened. 

Meanwhile, the St. Louis Police Officers Association has called on both the NFL and the Rams to discipline the five players.

They called the moved 'tasteless, offensive and inflammatory.'

The NFL and the Rams said Monday that the players would not be punished.

Cook spoke about the gesture following the game, saying; 'There has to be a change that starts with the people that are most influential around the world.'

He then added, 'No matter what happened on that day, no matter how the whole situation went down, there has to be a change.' 

St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar has claimed that Rams' chief operating officer called him to apologize about the incident, something he vehemently denies.

'We did not apologize,' Rams spokesman Artis Twyman told CNN. 

The Officers Association then responded to that claim by posting on their Facebook page; 'Even though Mr. Demoff stated he never apologized, the Chief believed it to be an apology and the Chief sent the email to police staff to let them know about the call, after he told Mr. Demoff he would share his sentiments with his staff.'
