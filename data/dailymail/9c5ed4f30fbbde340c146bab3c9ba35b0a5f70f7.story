A make-up artist has defied traditional beauty conventions by trading in his usual array of cosmetics in favor of a variety of everyday objects which he has used to transform the faces of his models.

Dior ambassador Andrew Gallimore, who has previously worked with the likes of Lady Gaga and Cara Delevingne, teamed up with British fashion photographer Rankin in order to showcase the unique beauty looks, which make use of everything from string and paint to acrylic and even UV light.

'I'm always interested to see what you can decorate a face with, rather than just lipstick, powder, and pencils,' Gallimore told Refinery29.

Strung together: Make-up artist Andrew Gallimore uses a variety of every day objects in order to create his weird and wonderful beauty looks

To the point: The Dior ambassador has worked with renowned British fashion photographer Rankin on dozens of shoots over the past few years

The renowned make-up artist has worked on a variety of shoots for Rankin's popular fashion magazine Hunger during the past few years, many of which have provided him with the perfect opportunity to experiment with his daring make-up alternatives. 

'I really wanted to do a makeup shoot on boys that wasn’t drag, but it also wasn’t just messy,' he said of one shoot. 'We did one quite early on for Hunger, and I wanted it to be about light and how light reacts to things. 

'I wanted him to look kind of like Predator. 

'So, I airbrushed the majority of the face in UV paint, but we shot it with a UV light so it has this extra dimension of crazy.'

Finding inspiration: Gallimore's work is influenced by all manner of things, from art exhibitions to the environment

Trip the light fantastic: The images also incorporate movement in order to offer added impact

When it comes to finding new and innovative beauty looks, Gallimore isn't short of ideas - and admits he has found inspiration in all manner of locations. 

'[I went] to an exhibition at the Tate in London, and I’d seen a sculpture with all these stringed pieces,' he says about one particular shoot. 

'I loved the shadow they cast... I [wanted to] do that on a face and in color. So, we pulled some references on how a stained-glass window casts a colorful shadow. 

'I thought about using photography gels for a similar effect, and we did a few different versions of that.

Clowning around: The photographs were taken over a number of years and have been brought together for the first time in Rankin's new book entitled Andrew Gallimore

Another perspective: Gallimore enjoys 'decorating' faces, rather than just making them up with traditional beauty products

[The model was] painted white to get rid of the features, and then the gels were stuck on in a way that you get the proper effect.'

After years of collaborating together, Rankin and Gallimore have now released a book which showcases the very best of their joint projects. 

Entitled Andrew Gallimore by Rankin, the artistic tome includes dozens of images of the make-up artist's most out-there beauty looks which Rankin sums up in one succinct sentence: 'You name it, we stuck it on them.
