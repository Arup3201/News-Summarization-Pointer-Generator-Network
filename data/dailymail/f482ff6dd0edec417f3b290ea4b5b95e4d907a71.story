Campaigners have hit out at Facebook for removing images of women who have undergone mastectomies because they are classified as 'pornography'.

Photographs posted online by The SCAR Project, which aims to raise awareness of breast cancer, show women proudly displaying the scars from having invasive surgery on their breasts.

But a number of them were removed by the social media giant, which has a policy banning sexually explicit images on the site.

The project's founder, photographer 
David Jay, was kicked off Facebook for a month over the images, and 
called for the site to educate its staff properly to avoid a repeat of 
the incident.

Controversial: Some of these images were banned from Facebook for their allegedly explicit content

Moving: The images by David Jay feature breast cancer survivors displaying their mastectomy scars

Inspiring: The photographs are intended to remove the stigma currently surrounding breast cancer

For several years, The SCAR Project has been encouraging women to share picture of their mastectomy scars in an attempt to remove the stigma surrounding breast cancer.

The striking images show women who have had their breasts removed, leaving them with highly visible surgery scars.

Last month, Mr Jay added a new set of photographs to the project's Facebook page in the wake of Angelina Jolie's revelation that she had undergone a double mastectomy in an attempt to avoid contracting cancer.

However, the social network soon removed many of the images and handed the photographer a 30-day ban for allegedly violating its terms of service.

He told NBC News: 'I can't imagine anyone finding anything pornographic or sexualised or even offensive in any way.'

Outrage: Campaigners have started a petition urging Facebook to change its policies on pictures like these

Apology: Facebook has now reinstated the images and vowed to clarify its photography policies

Defiant: Many breast cancer sufferers derive strength from the bravery of those featured in the images

In response, one breast cancer patient started a petition on Change.org in an attempt to persuade Facebook to clarify its policy on photographs of mastectomies.

She wrote: 'They document the physical and emotional toll of women and men who have undergone mastectomies.

'They raise awareness of the disease and reinforce the need for early intervention and research toward a cure.'

A Facebook spokesman has apologised for censoring the image, saying that the site has 'long allowed mastectomy photos to be shared on Facebook, as well as educational and scientific photos of the human body and photos of women breastfeeding'.

Project: David Jay began the series years ago but was recently inspired by Angelina Jolie's courage

Policy: Facebook insists it is a supporter of the campaign and will work with photographers in the future

Mr Jay spoke to representatives of the company yesterday in an attempt to prevent a repeat of the incident.

'They've had a policy in place allowing mastectomy photos, and they made it clear during our conference call that obviously mistakes had been made,' he told NBC.

'I think it's not lost on Facebook how important this issue is to so many people, and perhaps they'll spend some time internally educating their staff about the types of images The SCAR Project has.'

Facebook's official policy on pictures of nudity currently reads: 'Facebook has a strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved. We also impose limitations on the display of nudity.

'We aspire to respect people's right to share content of personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.'
