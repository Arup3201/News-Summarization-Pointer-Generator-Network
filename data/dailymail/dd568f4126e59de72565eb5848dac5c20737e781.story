A drunk mother left her two young children alone in an unlocked car while she went to ogle female strippers.

Brandi Jo Roman, 28, abandoned the three-year-old girl and crying five-year-old boy while she headed into a club in Tampa, Florida.

Officers  from the Tampa Police Department found her inebriated and sitting beside the stage of the Mons Venus strip club with cash in her hand.

Neglect: Brandi Jo Roman abandoned her children in a car that stank of alcohol while she went into a strip club

The children were sat in the Ford F-150 pick-up truck, which reeked of alcohol, with a can of a malt liquor called Four Loko in easy reach, according theÂ New York Daily News.

Roman, whose speech was slurred, now faces two charges of child neglect and her offspring have been taken into care by the Florida Department of Children and Families.

'When the officers asked her to stand up she was unstable,' said police spokesperson Janelle McGregor. 'They could smell the alcohol emitting from her mouth.'

When questioned, she told officers she had left her children in the car so they could watch a film. Both children had scratches, according to the Tampa Bay Times.

Club owner Joe Redner said Roman had asked the cover charge and then returned to her vehicle to collect more money to pay the $20.

'She paid some of it in quarters,' he said. 'My manager saw how inebriated she was and we didn't want her to go back to the car and drive away with those kids in that state.'

They allowed her in just long enough to order a drink while they waited for the police to arrive.

Roman was arrested and taken to Hillsborough County Jail in lieu of $4,000 bail.
