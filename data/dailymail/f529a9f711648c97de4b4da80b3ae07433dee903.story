An angry businessman has threatened to raise a weather balloon above his land every day to stop a ‘gang of Hooray Henrys’ from Prince William’s RAF base thundering overhead in their planes.

John Arthur Jones, 62, said the aircraft roar over his estate up to 75 times a day, as low as 200ft and at speeds of around 400mph, instead of flying over empty fields.

He was so annoyed by the Hawk jets that he threatened to raise a balloon into their flight path every day from his property in Anglesey, North Wales, to deter the pilots.

Frustration: John Arthur Jones has planes from RAF Valley in Anglesey regularly flying over his property

Runway: Aircraft at RAF valley, which fly excessively over Boddfordd according to Mr Jones

The chartered surveyor said the planes
 from nearby RAF Valley, where the Duke of Cambridge works as a rescue 
pilot, were scaring children attending a nursery on his land at Parc 
Cefni, where he rents out property to businesses.

Long running dispute: Mr Jones says he has corresponded with successive station commanders requesting they adjust their course

He repeatedly wrote to the base, 
asking in one letter:  ‘Are our  children being subjected, as some say 
in the village, to punishment by a gang of Hooray Henrys for daring to 
ask if they will fly  over open fields instead of a children’s nursery?’

In another letter, he warned: ‘Since 
you have refused to send independent observers to Parc Cefni I will be 
arranging for  a weather balloon to be raised daily at the corner of our
 property. It will be taken down each evening at midnight.’  

Within 48 hours of the base receiving 
the balloon threat, police were dispatched to talk to him and said the 
RAF had become concerned for their safety and that of the public.

Mr Jones said he felt the response was ‘ridiculous’.

‘I told the policeman I was proposing to put one up because the planes were scaring the children,’ he said.

‘The safety aspect of this was my main concern and I was worried.

‘These planes are coming in at a speed
 of around 400mph and as they get to the edge of the property they open 
the throttle and give it a hell of a blast.

‘I had noticed that the jets were starting to fly much lower and far more regularly.

‘They were flying straight over us 
despite having the rest of the fields surrounding us, which are either 
empty or have cattle in.’

The problems are being caused by fighter-jet pilots from Prince William's airbase

A spokesman for RAF Valley said: ‘We 
take our broader community responsibilities very seriously and we always
 strive to be a good neighbour, so we regret that Mr Jones has had cause
 to complain.

'[Pilots] are instructed to try to avoid direct over-flight of the Parc Cefni children’s nursery whenever possible.’

Speaking of the response to the 
balloon threat, a police spokesman said: ‘North Wales Police classified 
the event as “precautionary” and deployed an officer to speak with the 
resident and clarify his intentions and advise of the possible dangers 
to air traffic and the local community.

‘An amicable conversation ensued during which time our concerns for safety to local residents and air traffic were expressed.’
