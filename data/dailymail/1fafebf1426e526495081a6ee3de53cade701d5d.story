A man has been arrested for his wife's murder nearly four decades after she was last seen.

Marvin Gail Owens, now 62, is accused of killing his wife, 23-year-old Deborah Diane Owens, in Oroville, California in 1978 and then disposing of her body. Her remains have never been found.

Police say Owens had long been suspected in the disappearance but authorities only recently managed to gather enough evidence to secure an arrest warrant.

He was arrested in Nebraska on Wednesday and is awaiting extradition back to Butte County.

Investigators are also looking at whether Owens was involved in the disappearance of another woman just nine months before his wife vanished.

Arrested: Marvin Gail Owens, pictured left in his mugshot, is accused of killing his wife, 23-year-old Deborah Diane Owens, pictured right, in 1978 and then disposing of her body. He was arrested on Wednesday

His wife Deborah, a working mother-of-two, was last seen on November 19, 1978, at the family's home in Oroville and her husband reported her missing two days later.

At the time, family members and friends dismissed suggestions she would get up and leave her children, while others said there had been problems in the marriage, the Chico Enterprise-Record reported.

There were reportedly signs that a crime had taken place in the home but police were unable to gather enough evidence to charge anyone.

Still, investigators pushed on. Butte County Sheriff Perry Reniff, who joined the case a year after the disappearance, continued working on it even after he retired and continues to lead the investigation.

Last seen: Deborah was last seen at this home in Oroville, California where she lived with her husband and their two young daughters. Friends and family said she would never have left her children

Butte County sheriff's Sergeant Jason Hail told the Enterprise-Record that investigators had long suspected Owens was responsible for his wife's disappearance.

'Early on, [he] became the primary guy,' Hail said. 'Nothing else over the years has come up that would suggest anyone else was involved.'

Connected? Essie Margarette Hiett vanished the same year and had mutual friends with the Owens

He would not specify exactly what led to the arrest this week, but said detectives discovered important evidence from the house, and had gathered new witness statements, including from the couple's now-adult daughters. 

'This case has been building,' Hail said. 'Finally, there's enough evidence for the district attorney to feel comfortable filing the arrest warrant, though we haven't found her remains.'

Police also told Action News Now that statements by Owens himself had also contributed to his arrest, but no further details were given.  

After her disappearance, Owens moved out of the county and eventually the state, and has been living in Ogallala, Nebraska.

On Wednesday afternoon, Owens was arrested by Keith County sheriff's deputies in Ogallala, and he is now awaiting extradition back to Butte County. 

Investigators are also looking into any links with the February 1978 disappearance of Essie Margarette Hiett. 

Police would not say why they believe the cases could be connected but told Action News Now that the Owens and Hiett knew some of the same people. 

Hiett, then 48, left her job at a bar in the early hours of February 13, 1978, and headed home in her car, but the vehicle was found wrecked in a ditch with no one inside.

She was not heard from again and her body has never been found.
