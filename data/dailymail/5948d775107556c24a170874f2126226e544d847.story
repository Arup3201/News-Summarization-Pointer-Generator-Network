Now, the beauty giant's Creative Design Director McGrath has used her knowledge of seasonal trends as well as the brand's heritage as the inspiration behind this anniversary look.

Slimming secrets: Candice recently revealed the secrets behind her toned physique - she enjoys yoga and boxing, but when it comes to training, her 'butt workouts' are the most important in her regime

'This is a very bold, brave, decadent and hedonistic look,' said McGrath, who has worked backstage at Victoria Beckham's show and was recently awarded an MBE for her services to the fashion and beauty industry.

'There's bold shimmers, lots of colour, full blush, glossy lips. This is a really strong couture look that women can take inspiration from. 

'You can take the blush, a bold lip, even use the eyeshadow and just work it as an eyeliner - you can literally break it apart to make the perfect party look for you and if you’re brave, do the whole thing.'

The South African model recently opened up about how she achieves and maintains her incredible figure, admitting she’s been blessed with a fast metabolism but still strives to eat well and works out.

‘Food-wise, I'm very, very lucky that I can eat whatever I want. For me, I've always had a healthy lifestyle. If I eat something that’s not fresh, I feel it immediately, so I crave good food,’ she told OK! Magazine. 

‘I crave meat. I grew up on a dairy and beef farm, so I crave that. I don’t cut anything out, and I just work out more,’ she explained.

Candice enjoys yoga and boxing, but when it comes to training she told FitSugar.com that her 'butt workouts' are the most important in her regime.

'Butt for me is really important so [my trainer and I] always end with butt lifts on all fours,' she said.

'If I haven't seen him in a while the whole session is butt!'
