Andy Murray has been confirmed as the No 8 seed for the US Open, which begins on August 25.

Murray was set to be seeded No 9 until the withdrawal of defending champion Rafael Nadal through injury on Monday moved the Brit up one place.

However, it is still Murray's lowest Grand Slam seeding since he was No 12 at Wimbledon 2008.

Murray's promotion means he faces an easier draw in the last 16 against an opponent seeded between nine and 12.

Potential last-16 opponents include Latvian Ernests Gulbis or Frenchman Richard Gasquet, rather than big-serving Canadian Milos Raonic or his Wimbledon conqueror Grigor Dimitrov. 

Top seed Novak Djokovic is projected to meet Roger Federer in the final, the Swiss also benefiting from Nadal's withdrawal as he replaced the Spaniard as the No 2 seed.
