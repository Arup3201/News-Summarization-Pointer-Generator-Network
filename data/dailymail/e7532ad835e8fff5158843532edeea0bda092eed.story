Off limits: The teacher gave the student O'Doul's - unaware that it actually has alcohol in it

A Michigan teacher has given non-alcoholic beer to a classroom of fifth-grade students to teach them about beverages in Colonial times, it has emerged.

The teacher, who has not been identified, allowed students at Hyatt Elementary School in Linden to sip the O'Doul's that a student had brought to school to represent ale common in the 1700s.

The teacher was unaware that O'Doul's actually does contain 0.5 per cent alcohol, even though its label describes it as a non-alcoholic beverage.

Liquor
 Control Commission spokeswoman Andrea Miller says giving O'Doul's or 
similar drinks to minors can be prosecuted as a misdemeanor in Michigan - but no one has been charged.

Superintendent Ed Koledo told the Flint Journal that the teacher was 'a very responsible person' who did not intend to expose the children to harm.

He
 added that the O'Doul's was shown to the children as an example of a 
drink common in the 1700s, when water was sometimes dirty or unhealthy.

'We
 talked to the teacher and said this was an inappropriate choice,' 
Koledo said. 'There were a lot better choices to represent a 
colonial-era drink than what was chosen here.'

The students were allowed a small 
taste but none were forced to try the non-alcoholic beer, school 
officials said. School officials have not said how many students sampled the drink.

Three students in the 
class also took a bottle home.

Hyatt 
Principal Vicki Malkaravage sent a letter to parents on Friday informing
 them of what happened, The Flint Journal reported. It said that the teacher thought O'Doul's would be fine to share with the class because the label said it was a 
non-alcoholic malt beverage.

The student who brought the beer won't be 
disciplined and Koledo would not say whether the teacher will be disciplined.

'Nobody 
complained to the teacher, principal or me,' Koledo said. 'We monitored 
the situation the next day. It was a dead topic so we just left it at 
that.'
