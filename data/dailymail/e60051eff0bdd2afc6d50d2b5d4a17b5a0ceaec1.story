These are the painful ice burns suffered by the British schoolboy who miraculously survived a 2,500ft fall in the Alps despite bouncing off rocks and ice as he tumbled down the mountain.

Jack Fox, 14, stopped to take a photo on a rocky ledge during a school ski trip to Flattach near Salzburg, Austria last week.

But despite falling the equivalent of two and a half Eiffel Towers, the Year 10 student survived with just ice burns to his arms.

Lucky escape: Jack Fox, 14, suffered just this ice burn despite bouncing off rocks and ice as he tumbled 2,500ft down the mountain

Jack, an accomplished skier from Southport, Merseyside, fell on the very last run of his school's six-day, £850-per-head break.

A group of eight children were with an Austrian ski instructor when they took their skis off so they could take pictures of the scenery.

But as he lined up his photo, Jack slid over the edge and  plunged down the mountain-side.

He said: 'I thought that was it – that I'd be killed. I remembered it was a complete sheer drop to the mountain floor. I said to myself: 'Jack, it's only you that could do this.'

'But as I came down the mountain I kept trying to dig my feet in and pull up with my arms.

'I was crashing through ice and bouncing off rocks. It was terrifying. It felt like I was falling forever. I kept thinking 'How much more of this can I take?'

'Eventually I came to a halt. I checked everywhere to make sure I hadn't broken anything and it all seemed fine.

'When I looked back up the mountain I thought: 'I've just fallen from there'. It was only then that I noticed the pain in my arms'.

His cries for help were heard by an extreme skier and rescuers soon arrived and airlifted him off the mountain.

He was later handed the smashed ski helmet that saved his life, which had virtually disintegrated during the fall.

He said: 'It was a sunny day and other people had taken their helmets off to take pictures. I kept mine on – and I'm so glad I did. Without it I wouldn't have survived.'

Doctors found he had severe ice burns on his left arm and only slightly less serious ones on his right. He was kept in overnight because of the concussion he had suffered.

After being flown back to Britain he went into surgery at Alder Hey Children's Hospital, Liverpool, for a deep skin scrub under anaesthetic.

'That was worse than the fall itself,' said Jack, a pupil at Tarleton Academy.

Describing the fall, he added: 'One moment it was fine, the next my boots were slipping and I was gone.

'I heard later the rest of the party were crying and praying for me. They thought I was a gonner, and the instructor was pretty upset.

'I know I'm really lucky. My teachers said I should go out and by a lottery ticket – I was bound to win'.

Jack's father Stewart Fox, 48, found out about the accident when he received a call from his son's teacher.

He said: 'I got the call from this distressed teacher and because of the tone of his voice, the first thing I asked was 'Is he alive?'

'When you pack your lad away to Austria on a skiing trip and get a teacher in distress, you think the worst.

'He was with the advanced party and went to the top of the mountain and to a well known beauty spot up on a ledge.'

Mr Fox added: 'Apparently all these people were taking photos at this area. He was facing forward and taking photos of the view.

'He just lost his footing. He's very keen to stress he was not taking a selfie because it makes him sound stupid. It could have so easily been the dreaded call.'

'His friends were all praying and in tears at the top. They couldn't go and look because they would follow him and they would be like lemmings. They all thought he was dead.

'When the teacher told me he was alive, my thoughts went from sheer dread to relief. He could very very easily have died.

'They told him in the helicopter it was 2,500ft he fell. He tells me he used his boots to try and dig in and slow himself down and then as soon as he did they gripped and they flipped over. I don't think he realised how fast he was going.'

His mother Amanda, 41, had nothing but praise for Jack's teacher, Jack Snowden and the rest of the teachers. 'We've absolutely no complaints. They were brilliant'.

Jack is expected to return to school on Monday, after recovering from a 'skin scrub' on his wounds at Alder Hey Children's Hospital. 

It is unclear whether his scars will be permanent. But none of the drama has put Jack, who has been skiing for two years, off the sport. 

He said: 'I haven't been put off at all, I'm definitely going to be carrying on.' 

His father added: 'It wasn't the skiing that caused this, it was the photography! I don't have any worries about him going back out on the slopes.'
