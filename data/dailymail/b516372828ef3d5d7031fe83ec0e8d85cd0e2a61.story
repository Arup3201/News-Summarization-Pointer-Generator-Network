The Connecticut State Police investigation into Adam Lanza's killing spree at Sandy Hook Elementary School has revealed that he studied other mass killings from around the world intently

Adam Lanza planned his Sandy Hook massacre in meticulous detail on a chilling 7ft long spreadsheet that police believe was used to keep score of killings, it was revealed today.

Connecticut State Police found the 4ft wide document in Lanza's harddrive that was so big it required a special printer after the December 14 attack that left 26 people dead.

It contained Lanza’s obsessive research - in nine-point font - about mass murders of the past, and even attempted murders.

Among the tragedies Lanza studied were the 2006 mass shooting 
carried out by Charles Carl Robert IV in which he killed five 
Amish school girls as well as the 2011 massacre of 77 people in Norway 
by Anders Behring Breivik.

Investigators revealed they have found 
reams of articles about multiple shootings, leading them to speculate he
intended to outdo them all.

Police have also discovered evidence that 
Lanza became extremely efficient in his mastery of his AR-15 Bushmaster 
assault rifle - leading them believe he had been planning his assault for a 
long time.

Officers outlined the findings at the International Association of Police Chiefs and Colonels mid-year meeting in New Orleans last week, a law enforcement veteran told the New York Daily News.

According to the officer: 'We were told (Lanza) had around 500 
people on this sheet. Names and the number of people killed and the weapons that were used, 
even the precise make and model of the weapons.

'It had to have taken 
years. It sounded like a doctoral thesis, that was the quality of the 
research.

'They don't believe this was just a spreadsheet. They believe it was a score sheet,' he continued. 'This was the work of a video gamer, and that it was his intent to put his own name at the very top of that list.

'They believe that he picked an elementary school because he felt it was a point of least resistance, where he could rack up the greatest number of kills. That's what (the Connecticut police) believe.

'They believe that (Lanza) believed that it was the way to pick up the easiest points. It's why he didn't want to be killed by law enforcement.

'In the code of a gamer, even a deranged gamer like this little bastard, if somebody else kills you, they get your points. They believe that's why he killed himself.'

Lanza's killing 
spree lasted less than five minutes and during that time he fired 152 
bullets into two classrooms in the Connecticut elementary school.

Lanza also had hundreds more rounds of ammunition on him and in the car that he drove to the school in.

Arriving at Sandy Hook Elementary 
School at 9.35 a.m., Lanza, 20, shot through the glass windows at the 
school entrance and immediately encountered Principal Dawn Hochsprung 
and school psychologist Mary Scherlach, who had been alerted by the 
gunfire.

He shot them both to death on sight. Two teachers were also injured by ricocheting bullets from that initial burst of gunfire.

One had been in the school's meeting room with Hochsprung and Scherlach and was wounded in the leg.

The other was further down the hallway outside her classroom after rushing out on hearing the shots and was hit in the foot.

Police investigating the home of Adam Lanza in Sandy Hook Connecticut have uncovered a dossier regarding every mass murder inside and outside of the United States that he had compiled

The
member of staff who had been shot in the leg managed to crawl and call 
the police, which explains the rapid response time of law enforcement to
the school.

Continuing
down the corridor it was then that Lanza apparently walked by the 
classroom of Kaitlin Roig, who had closed her classroom door on hearing 
the gunfire.

The school had recently performed a 
practice lockdown drill and the black construction paper that had been 
put up on the door had been left there - leading Lanza to think the 
classroom was empty.

Roig and her class, sat in petrified silence while they heard Lanza continue past their door.

Lanza
then walked into the classroom of substitute teacher Lauren Rousseau to
find her and the terrified children huddled together at the back of the
room trying to hide in a bathroom.

The deranged shooter killed Rousseau and all but one of her class.

The
little girl escaped by playing dead and emerged from the school with 
her clothes covered in blood saying, 'Mommy, I'm okay, but all my 
friends are dead.'

Before he set off on his killing spree - Adam Lanza shot his mother Nancy in the face while she slept and then took the assault rifles she kept in a vault in their home

She was the only survivor from a class of 16.

When asked by her parents what she saw, the unnamed girl said she saw someone who was 'angry' and 'very mad.'

According
to the unnamed source familiar with the report, Lanza then walked back 
towards teacher Victoria Soto's class and upon entering encountered 
children cowering under their desks.

He
fatally shot these students along with Soto and then dramatically his 
assault rifle jammed - allowing six children from the class to escape 
out of the classroom while he reloaded.

Unknown to Lanza, Soto had placed 
five children in a closet before he entered and opened fire and they 
were found unharmed after authorities arrived.

Authorities have also dispelled the theory that Lanza was shooting at police as they arrived.

Despite
bullets being fired out of the school as police rushed up the drive to 
the school, investigators now believe that Lanza was firing at a teacher
who was standing by a window.

Realizing
that police were closing in, Lanza then turned one of the two pistols 
he was carrying on himself less than five minutes after he began his 
killing spree and just as police were entering the building.

State
police have periodically updated the victims' families as the 
investigation has unfolded. Danbury State's Attorney Stephen Sedensky 
has said he hopes that the final report on the massacre will be 
published  by the end of June.
