A bride will have her doll called Bert, which she treats like her real-life son, play the special role of pageboy at her wedding.

Louise Keel, 46, from Caerphilly, South Wales, was heartbroken after finding out she couldn't have children of her own, so spent more than £1,000 on the lifelike curly-haired toddler.

Now Bert will be dressed up in a pageboy outfit for her big day in spring 2014 when Louise, who is registered blind and uses a wheelchair, weds fiance Brian.

Louise Keel of Caerphilly couldn't have children of her own so she bought 'reborn' dolls from the internet

She said: 'Finding out I couldn't have my own family left a gaping hole in my life but now I am settled and happy with my partner Brian.

'When we marry next year Bert will be my pageboy - it will mean a lot to me.'

Bert is made out of a special silicon material and has lifelike skin, hair and eyes.

Louise bought him after doctors told her she would never be able to have a child of her own.

When her partner Brian, 48, proposed Louise started planning her wedding with Bert as the guest of honour.

Louise bought Bert through after discovering a company offering 'reborn dolls' on the internet.

He is 2ft 6in tall and has curly blonde hair and cute button nose.

Louise often wraps him up warm and takes him out in a buggy to feed the ducks and visit local attractions.

Her fiance Brian said: 'Louise and I work well as a team. We met online and built a loving relationship.

'She already had her dolls when I met her so I'm used to them being around.

'Bert has his own characteristics, he's so cheeky. He even has his own Twitter account with over 80 followers.

'Louise and Bert have such a strong bond. They sing duets and daydream together.

'When I told Bert that Louise and I were together he wasn't happy at all - he can be quite jealous but we are a family.

'The end result is that Louise is completely thrilled with Bert which makes it very worthwhile.

'I am delighted she has him. It's so special for her to be able to hold a character she herself has created.'

Louise has two other lifelike dolls Leah-Rose and Cassidy-Anne, which are both babies.

Every morning she wakes up early to warm bottles of formula and feed her family. Her home is filled with all the equipment new mums need, including baby bouncers, bottles and comforter blankets.

She buys her plastic children Christmas presents and sings them lullabies at night.

But her children don't cry or make a mess.

The silicone dummies are hand-picked for their realistic weight and soft feel but they lack the sounds - and smells - of a real baby.

Louise, of Caerphilly, South Wales, said: 'My children give me that same rush of love a new mum gets when she holds her baby for the first time.

'Just holding one of the dolls takes the edge off my pain. I love stroking their hair and feeling their chubby cheeks.

'When I get married next year I'll make sure Bert looks a picture in a full made-to-measure pageboy outfit.

'My other reborn babies, Leah-Rose and Cassidy-Anne, will stay at home - they're too small.

'But there's no way I'm getting married without my little boy.'
