Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are set to clash in England and Carlos Tevez is in line for a return to Upton Park after Argentina released their squad for friendlies next month.

Nine Premier League players have been included in the 24-man squad, along with a host of stars from Europe’s top leagues. 

Gerardo Martino’s side take on Croatia at Upton Park on November 12 and then Portugal at Old Trafford five days later.

Portugal are yet to announce their squad but Cristiano Ronaldo is expected to be included, setting up a mouth-watering clash with Messi - who will be looking to avenge Barcelona's 3-1 loss to Real Madrid on Saturday. 

As well as the return of Ronaldo to Old Trafford, Manchester United duo Angel di Maria and Marcos Rojo will also play for Argentina at their club ground.

Meanwhile Tevez, who last played for his country at the 2011 Copa America on home soil, is a surprise inclusion having missed this year's World Cup in Brazil.
