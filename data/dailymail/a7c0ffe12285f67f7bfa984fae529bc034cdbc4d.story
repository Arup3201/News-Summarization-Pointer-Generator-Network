A Missouri grandmother is celebrating the arrival of her newest grandchild, after she acted as a surrogate for her son and daughter-in-law.

Sandy Lawrence gave birth to Jarrett Jacob on Wednesday. It was the second time the 50-year-old has acted as a surrogate for the family, after carrying their first child in 2012.

Her daughter-in-law, Mindy, was unable to carry her own children after having a hysterectomy when she was a teenager.

The 25-year-old, and her husband, Jake, had considered adopting when they first married but then his mother offered to carry the baby for them.

'What mother would not do this for their child,' Mrs Lawrence said, adding she agreed to do it 'so they can have a child of their own'.

Mindy had been plagued with health problems from the age of 10, which resulted in her having a hysterectomy to end the pain she had been in.

'I knew when we got married that I could not have kids,' Mindy Lawrence told WMC-TV. The couple didn't have the $30,000 needed to use a surrogate, but had started to discuss adopting when Mrs Lawrence offered to help.Â 

The first time she acted as the surrogate, Mrs Lawrence was 48, and the family were concerned her age would cause health problems.

'We asked the doctor all these questions and he was just like it was no big deal. Technology is so amazing.' Mindy said.

Mrs Lawrence's husband, Jeff, said he had been concerned about how the pregnancy would affect his wife the first time around.

'My main concern was her health. She's the love of my life and I don't want anything to happen to her,' he told WMC-TV.

Fortunately, both pregnancies went well, with the couple's first child, Mya, being born in 2012 and Jarrett being born this week.

'[Sandy] has made it all possible, beside God giving her the love and the care to do this for us, it would never have happened,' Mindy Lawrence said.
