Laura Dowling, who had overseen flower decorations at the White House for six years, ended her employment with no notice according to sources with 'close ties to current residence staffers'

Despite leaving the White House more than a month ago, official confirmation of the chief floral designer's unexpected departure has only just emerged.

Laura Dowling, who had overseen flower decorations for events such as official state dinners for six years, ended her employment with no notice according to sources with 'close ties to current residence staffers'.

Dowling 'was escorted from the building' on February 13, reports The Washington Post.

In the wake of the Post's revelation and coming almost six weeks after Dowling's departure, the White House released a statement on Tuesday in which it praised her 'lively and colorful' creations, which reflected the 'historic rooms which they graced.'

'As chief florist, Laura Dowling and her team treated guests of the White House to their beautiful floral arrangements,' read a statement issued by Michelle Obama's office on Tuesday.

'Ms Dowling's creations were always lively and colorful, reflecting not only the season but the unique and historic rooms which they graced. 

'No two arrangements were ever the same and each one left guests with a lasting impression of the elegance and history of the People's House. We are grateful for her contribution over the years and wish her well.'

Within an hour of the first lady's official confirmation, Dowling also felt compelled to release a statement about her sudden departure weeks before.  

'After almost six years as Chief Floral Designer at the White House, I have resigned in order to pursue exciting new opportunities and explore my passion for floral artistry and design,' said Dowling in a statement issued by heavyweight law firm Sidley Austin.

The first lady's office released a statement on Tuesday which praised the work of florist Laura Dowling who had unexpectedly departed her post more than a month before

'Over the next few weeks and months, I'll be launching a new platform for my work as an author, speaker, instructor and design consultant that builds on the creative ideas and partnerships I've formed during my tenure there. 

'It's been such an honor to work at the White House and I will always be grateful for this incredible opportunity.'

But Dowling's unexpected departure and the sudden release of two statements more than a month later has prompted speculation that all was not well between Dowling and the first lady.

Several unnamed floral designers who continue to provide bouquets to the White House told the Post that Dowling left because her 'fussy style' wasn't in keeping with the first lady's desire for a modern and clean aesthetic.

When Dowling was first appointed she was highly regarded for her organic and less formal 'French look,' but now that seems to have fallen out of favor at the White House. 

Just days before the florist's departure, the Old Family Dining Room had been re-opened after being refurbished by the First Lady to showcase modern art and design, according to the White House website. 

Dowling's predecessor, Nancy Clarke, had lasted through six presidential administrations.

During her tenure as First Lady, Mrs Obama has taken a greater interest in gardening than most of her predecessors - but the focus has been herbs and vegetables rather than floral.

Mrs Obama is a huge advocate for gardening - but her focus is on fresh vegetables and herbs as tied to better eating. She famously cultivates and promotes the White House Kitchen Garden - and tends to it here with elementary school students back in 2009
