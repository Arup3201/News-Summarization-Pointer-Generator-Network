Targeted: Big Brother winner Kate Lawler was subjected to a six-year stalking campaign by Mark Taylor

A stalker who bombarded Big Brother winner Kate Lawler with love letters, explicit pictures and even pairs of knickers was today has been jailed for eight months.

Obsessed Mark Taylor also sent dozens of newspaper cuttings and crude pictures to the former reality TV star's workplace.

In much of the correspondence, he declared his love for the 31-year-old Kerrang DJ, sending her topless tabloid snaps of herself, a dictionary and, bizarrely, a dinner plate.

He even sent a magazine picture of two pairs of feet at the bottom of a bed with the male pair marked with his name and the female marked with 'Kate.'

The 49-year-old set about his campaign of mailing in 2005, but after breaking three separate restraining orders, Judge Anthony King sent him to prison.

Balding, jobless Taylor first broke his restraining order in January 2006 and was handed a community order instead.

He continued sending letters to Ms Lawlor and was sent for a brief stint in jail.

However, his stalking continued on his release and in November 2009 he was once again before the courts for sending items to Ms Lawler and also to Meg Ryan and Anne Robinson.

He was given a strict restraining order banning him from sending any form of message to anybody in the public eye.

However, in March this year, Taylor, of Salter Close, Oxford, peppered Ms Lawler with dozens of pairs of knickers, newspaper cuttings and other items to the Kerrang Radio offices.

In the public eye: Ms Lawler pictured leaving the Big Brother house with presenter Davina McCall after winning the third series of the reality show in 2002.

Prosecutor Cathy Olliver produced a 
box full of thongs and an evidence bag stuffed with letters at the 
hearing at Oxford Crown Court.

Ms Olliver said: 'Ms Lawler was distressed and frightened by it. She doesn't know what his intentions are.'

Clare Evans, mitigating, said: 'There's very little for me to say. Mr Taylor has repeatedly breached the restraining order.

'Mr Taylor thinks that he is being humorous. He thinks the communications are funny.

'His first psychologist said he was 'erotomania delusional' but that was dismissed by a second doctor who said he had Asperger syndrome.

'But a third doctor dismissed both of these and said he was a man with a bit of an odd personality.

'It is a menace, annoying and persistent but it has never got any worse.'

Taylor, who admitted breaching the restraining order, was jailed for eight months.

Judge King said: 'I don't pretend to know the answer to why you keep on doing this but I certainly know what you are doing is wholly unwelcome and contrary to the restraining order.

'It is making life for the person concerned a misery.

'It was not one breach, but numerous. You have bombarded her with different communications all of which are upsetting and unwelcome.

'I have no other option but to jail you to keep you away from her for a very long time.'
