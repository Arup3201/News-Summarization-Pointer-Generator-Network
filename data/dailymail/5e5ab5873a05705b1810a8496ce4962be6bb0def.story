A tenant turned his home into a sophisticated cannabis factory worth almost £70,000.

The man, who vanished when the drugs were found, filled two bedrooms in his terraced home with at least 40 potted plants covered in tents.

And the landlord only discovered the stash when he dropped by the property unannounced after deciding to put it on the market.

Police are now hunting the tenant, who fled the home in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, on Sunday night.

Property manager Samuel Gluck said: 'I was very surprised. He was a very good tenant.'

There were around 40 mature plants growing in neat pots housed in little tents, police revealed.

Mr Gluck, of Northgate Lettings, who was managing the property for a landlord, said he never suspected the quiet tenant.

'He was a very amiable guy and always paid his rent on time,' he added.

'When the landlord told me he had found a drugs factory I thought he must just mean there were two or three plants on a window sill. But there were two bedrooms full, all in full bloom ready to be harvested.'

And Mr Gluck, who has had problems with drugs farmers attempting to rent his properties in the past, is now warning other landlords to beware.

Sophisticated: The farm was covered in sophisticated tents, which have now been seized by the police

'Cannabis farms these days are very difficult to detect,' he said.

'In the past they used to bypass the electricity and cover the windows, but this one was very low energy. It’s happening more and more and I think it’s a lot more sophisticated now.'

Police have since seized the plants and equipment after being notified by the landlord.

A Northumbria Police spokesman said: 'At 8.25pm last night we got a report that a cannabis farm had been found inside an address on Whitehall Road in Gateshead.

'Officers attended and recovered 40 cannabis plants and seized equipment. Inquiries are ongoing.'

Anyone with any information should call Northumbria Police on 101.
