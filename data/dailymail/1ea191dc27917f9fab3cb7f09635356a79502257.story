Liz Hodgkinson is now reliant on alcohol and feels as though she needs an evening tipple

On Sunday, I arrived home at around 5pm to be confronted with my worst nightmare: there was no wine in the house. Not a single bottle, anywhere. And I know, because I searched high and low to find one. How on earth would I manage without my evening tipple?

I didn't. Even though I'd already had a drink at lunchtime, and even though I'd just driven 50 miles in pouring rain to get home, I got back in the car and drove to the nearest supermarket. There, I picked up a couple of bottles of ready-chilled white wine — and despair and misery instantly turned to happiness.

Over the years, as I have hit 50, 60 and now 70, my dependence on alcohol has been steadily growing. At one time I could take it or leave it; but no more.

The quantity I consume has also increased. I would once take a bottle of wine to a friend's dinner party, now I always take two. And there doesn't seem as much wine in a bottle as there used to be.

When eating out with a friend, we always order a bottle, saying we can take home what we don't finish. But never once has that bottle accompanied us out of the restaurant.

A few years ago, I was horrified when, at a dinner party, my sixty-something host and hostess had a bottle of wine each by their plates. But now I do the same. When my friend who drinks only red comes round (I drink only white), we both have a bottle by our plates.

The truth is that I, along with most of my sixty-plus women friends, never let a day go by without at least half a bottle of wine to improve it. These days, we are not so much ladies who lunch, as ladies who lurch.

So I am not surprised by figures released yesterday revealing a fast-growing number of over-60s seeking help for alcoholism. Research from Public Health England says that 2,276 women over 60 sought professional help for problem drinking in 2013-14, compared with 1,436 five years ago.

Serious drinking was once only for men — but somewhere along the line women caught up. Then overtook them. Along with our new, independent, social, self-sufficient lifestyles came the liberating fact that we could drink just like men do.

Today, we drink more than our mothers and grandmothers, and in a different way, too. Alcohol is our modern feminist equivalent of a nice cup of cocoa in the evenings, or a Horlicks before bed.

And we certainly don't limit ourselves to a dainty sip of wine. Nowadays, we drink as much as we want, whenever we want — and whatever the consequences.

The demon drink has certainly got me into some scrapes. Not long ago, friends had to help me into a taxi when they realised I was too drunk to drive home. The next day, I had to catch a train and another taxi to their house, 30 miles away, to retrieve my car.

God, the shame of turning up contrite and sober — and with no recollection of the evening before.

Then there was the time I fell down unconscious in the street after a party where I just drank and drank, losing all restraint. I was taken to A&E in an ambulance, having hit my head, and kept in hospital until 4pm the next day.

To this day, I have no idea who called the ambulance.

Once I was so drunk I left my handbag on a bus. Thankfully, the bus stopped just up the road and a woman got out, waving my handbag.

The quantity she consumes has also increased and she would now take two bottles of wine to a dinner party 

It is also true, sadly, that after a few drinks I have been attracted to men I would not give the time of day to when sober.

It's not only teenagers who end up in bed with unsuitable men because they are wildly drunk. I have done it, too, even though I'm old enough to know better. I was once staying in a hotel when, after a few too many at the bar, a man — a total stranger — followed me up to my room and knocked on my door.

We ended up in bed together. I never saw him again, and was mortified at my behaviour.

In recent years, my drinking has spread from an evening pursuit, as it was when I worked full-time, to more of an all-day affair.

When I go to the cinema, I usually take half a bottle of wine in. I hardly remember the film the next day, but watching sober has become an impossibility. Ice cream and popcorn just aren't the same.

I cannot remember the last time I watched a TV programme sober, either. Downton Abbey, Call The Midwife, Grantchester … all have passed me by in an alcoholic haze.

My drinking has been fuelled by the fact that I now have my own 'cellar' — a cupboard in my kitchen fitted out with a wine rack which can be replenished with just a click of a computer mouse on a supermarket website.

Online shopping means that as soon as I notice stock running low (which happens with worrying frequency), I can book a home delivery. Goodness knows what happened this weekend! I still can't believe that I'd forgotten to order.

She said: 'The truth is that I, along with most of my sixty-plus women friends, never let a day go by without at least half a bottle of wine to improve it'

In the past, only men chose wine or ordered it for their cellars. But the internet lets women like me buy booze in secret. I can order an entire case with no one else being any the wiser.

There is no one to see me lugging the wine to my car and unloading it at the other end. There isn't even a checkout assistant to give knowing glances.

The only tricky part is spiriting the empty bottles out of the house to the recycling bank without too much clanking of glass.

And because I live on my own, a 70-year-old divorcee, there is no one around to tell me to stop.

But it's not just single women who are drinking more. I know lots of married women whose drinking has increased with age. Some even say they've re-bonded with their husbands over a shared enjoyment of a gin and tonic.

That certainly wasn't the way respectable married ladies once behaved. My grandmother might have indulged in a small glass of sherry at Christmas, and my mother enjoyed a bottle of Mackeson's stout with her Sunday lunch. But that was all. It would never have occurred to them to drink any more than that.

But then our entire lifestyles are different. My generation has been out in the world: we've held down big jobs, earned our own money, had busy social lives and enjoyed our independence.

According to the new research, most elderly problem drinkers are professional women. Having got used to the crutch of alcohol during our working lives, our drinking really takes off when we retire.

Armed with good pensions, today's older women can afford to buy wine in more or less unlimited quantities.

There are other drivers, too. I live alone and, like many divorcees, sometimes drink to alleviate loneliness and boredom. I seem to reconnect with myself when I drink. While time drags during the day, it speeds by once I'm drinking.

Alcohol makes my thoughts come alive. It makes me feel like a human being again, rather than a lost soul wondering what to do.

Of course, drinking does sometimes prove dangerous. One close friend drank herself to death after her husband died. Her drinking had gradually escalated until she needed a bottle of vodka to get through the day, and she just wouldn't seek help.

But older women trying to cut down rarely succeed. One friend now drinks every other day, rather than every day — but on the days she drinks, she is drinking twice as much as before.

At times, I've worried that my own drinking was out of hand. Last Christmas, I cut out wine altogether, just to see if I could. I managed — but only just. And it was sheer, unadulterated hell.

I celebrated New Year with a 'mocktail' — a sickly-sweet fruity drink — and for a whole fortnight was crotchety, bad-tempered and sulky. In the end, one of my sons begged me to get back on the wine.

After two weeks of self-denial, reuniting with my reliable friend was a heady experience. I was immediately back to half a bottle of wine (at least) a day, even though I promised myself I'd try to keep to just one glass.

So, what is my health like after more than 40 years of daily drinking, often to excess?

Well, I'm sorry to disappoint any doom-and-gloom merchants, but it's perfect. I'm in much better nick than most 70-year-olds, and when I had medical tests five years ago, I was told I had the innards of a 30-year-old.

I do try to minimise health risks by going to the gym every day and watching what I eat. In a way, my whole lifestyle is ordered to accommodate my drinking.

I also kid myself that I can keep my drinking within safe limits, even if I am exceeding my self-imposed quota (not to mention the two units a day that the Government recommends women stick to).

Indeed, the only problem with my drinking is keeping my wine cellar stocked — and avoiding another late-night supermarket dash.
