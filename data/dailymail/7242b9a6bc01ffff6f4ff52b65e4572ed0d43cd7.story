A man whose dog bit a postman has been asked to pay nearly £70,000 of legal fees after a row over the incident ended up in court.

After postman Robert Townsend was bitten by pointer-setter cross Rocky as he did his rounds in Fishburn, County Durham, he took on lawyers who offered dog owner Paul Race, 64, the chance to settle out of court for £6,000.

When Mr Race contested it, saying his dog only bit the Royal Mail worker because he hit it with his satchel, the dispute ended in a court battle which the dog owner ultimately lost.

'I'm a victim of compensation culture': Dog owner Paul Race, 64, has been asked to pay legal fees of £68,000

Now he has been sent a bill by the postman's solicitor demanding he pay £68,538.02 in legal fees arising from the case around the bite, which the dog owner's lawyer says caused just a 'minor cut'.

Mr Race, a landlord, now fears his home may be repossessed, and says he is victim of a growing trend in Britain to bring no-win, no-fee personal injury lawsuits.

He said: 'This [bill] highlights everything that is wrong with the no-win, no-fee compensation culture.'

Mr Townsend was bitten by the pet dog in April 2008 as he made his rounds in the village near Sedgefield.

Nearly a year later, the postman instructed Leeds-based solicitors Simpson Millar to pursue his grievance against the dog owner, and after two years of legal wrangling, Mr Race was told the postman would agree to settle out of court for £2,000 compensation plus legal fees of £4,061.02.

However, disputes over whether the dog belonged to Mr Race or his ex-partner, and differing accounts over what took place when the postman was bitten, resulted in the case going before Middlesbrough County Court in January this year.

The judge ruled in Mr Townsend’s favour and he was awarded £1,500 compensation, which Mr Race paid.

But when he was subsequently presented with a bill of costs totalling £68,532.02, Mr Race said he felt he had no choice but to appeal.

The amount, which is still up for negotiation and must be approved by a judge, covers the cost of Simpson Millar's solicitor fees, including the additional money awarded for winning the case, as well as the fees of barristers, medical experts, witnesses and other administrative and legal expenses incurred during the proceedings.

Nagam Din, of Simpson Millar LLP, said: 'Mr Townsend was subject to a distressing dog attack and, as such, he is entitled to compensation.

'From the outset, Simpson Millar has sought a swift and reasonable settlement to the case including mediation.

'Against the explicit advice from his solicitor to accept the court’s original decision, Mr Race remained determined to continue the dispute which caused additional delay and associated costs.'

Earlier this week Mr Race lost his appeal at the Civil Appeal Court in London.  Now his solicitor says he fears he could be asked to pay even more, and fears losing his house.

Lawyer Nathan Horsley, of Hedleys & Co in Sunderland, said: 'Mr Race made the decision to appeal based on Simpson Millar’s fees and the fact he didn’t agree with all that was said,' he said.

'We didn’t charge Mr Race to represent him at the appeal as we felt he was a victim of the no-win-no-fee compensation culture.'
