The family of a millionaire 
businessman shot dead in Spain have been refused permission to bring his
 body home and been forced to bury him there.

Andy Bush, 48, was allegedly killed by ex-girlfriend Mayka Kukucova shortly after arriving at his villa in Estapona in April.

It is claimed she had been laying in wait for the gold dealer who arrived with his latest love interest Maria Korotaeva, 21.

He
 was then shot three times before Kukucova fled the scene in Andy's 
Hummer and re-appeared in her home country - almost 2,000 miles away, 
three days later.

A Spanish 
judge has insisted his body has to stay in the country for up to five 
years for post-mortem examinations during the murder inquiry and court 
trials.

His devastated 
family said the judge ordered his body should be buried on Friday - but 
they managed to persuade him to wait until today to allow 
them time to fly out to Spain.

Mr
 Bush's sister Rachel Bush, 42, who led the campaign to get his body 
released, said: 'I was told at 5pm on Wednesday that they planned to 
bury him on Friday.

'I 
pleaded with the judge to give us more time so we could go over, which 
is how it should be. I felt absolutely stunned and shocked and numb when
 they told me.

'Until we can bury him we can't grieve.

'My
 dad has died and my mum is struggling. I'm the one fighting for it, 
trying to get him home. I don't know how many times they need to check 
his body.'

Mr Bush's daughter Ellie, 19, flew out with Rachel for the burial yesterday morning.

Despite
 the setback, the family has vowed to continue with the campaign, which 
has already collected more than 1,980 signatures, supported by Bristol 
MP Chris Skidmore.

Mr 
Skidmore said: 'I am determined to do all I can to ensure that his body 
is laid to rest in the UK in accordance with his family's wishes.

'I
 am encouraged by the fact that, from contact we have had with the 
Embassy in Malaga through the Consular Directorate, the Spanish 
authorities are sympathetic to the wishes of the family and that the 
family have the opportunity to speak to the presiding judge in the case 
on Monday.

'I will continue 
to do all I can to help the Bush family achieve their goal of laying 
Andy to rest in the UK and look forward to meeting with Rachel Bush in 
the near future.

'My thoughts are with Rachel, Ellie and the rest of the Bush family at this difficult time.'

Miss Korotaeva, has told Spanish detectives Kukucova was waiting inside his rented villa and opened the door to them after they flew to the Costa del Sol to celebrate their five-month anniversary together.

The 21-year-old student at the University of the West of England said she heard shots and a row after leaving the ex-lovers inside the house to argue - and saw his ex flee moments later with the keys to his 4x4 which was later found abandoned nearby.

She found his body on the living room floor after firefighters forced their way in following her desperate emergency call.

Investigators say Mr Bush was shot twice with an Italian-made .38 special revolver.

Couple: At the time of his death, Mr Bush had started a relationship with student Maria Korotaeva

Witness: Miss Korotaeva said she left the room shortly before Mr Bush was shot dead in April

Claims: Mr Bush's new girlfriend said that his ex was madly jealous and described her as a 'snake'

Russian-born Miss Korotaeva has described Kukucova as being madly jealous, and said her boyfriend had to change all the locks at his house in Bristol after splitting with her last year.

She claimed in an interview shortly after the killing: 'Andy hated her with a passion. She was like a poisonous snake.'

Kukucova, who has not yet been charged with any crime, is expected to claim that she shot Mr Bush in self-defence during an argument.

Her lawyer in Slovakia said yesterday: 'I haven't been officially informed about her extradition yet by anybody.

'Due to this situation I cannot provide you with any details of the handover.

'She will be represented by one of my colleagues who is recognised as one of the best criminal lawyers in Spain.'

However, sources close to the case in Spain confirmed she had been extradited.
