Tragedy: Little Kiran Mir was left with terrible brain damage after choking on the ball

A girl of seven choked to death on a bouncy ball after it hit a wall and flew into her mouth, an inquest heard.

Kiran Mir had been playing with the ball at home when it became lodged in her throat.

Her mother, Shakeela, was in the room at the time of what was described by the coroner as a ‘one in a million’ chance accident.

Her parents desperately tried to dislodge the toy, but the child’s heart stopped and she died in hospital two days later.

Her father, Shahid, 45, said: ‘Kiran was such a happy, generous little girl. She had been to the shops with her mum and spent her pocket money on two 20p bouncy balls – one for her, and one for her sister.

‘Suddenly, [my wife] noticed Kiran was unable to breathe. She tried to reach the ball in her mouth, and started slapping on her back. But the ball wouldn’t budge.’

Mr Kir, a community project manager in Birmingham who had been at work nearby at the time, arrived just before paramedics. He said: ‘I tried holding her upside down, putting my hands under her ribs and pulling upwards. She was just floppy.’

Kiran, one of four children, died on March 1 after suffering a heart attack and severe brain damage. Mr Mir said: ‘It has devastated our family. Her siblings miss her every day.’

Birmingham coroner Adrian Cotter recorded a verdict of accidental death. He said: ‘This was an unhappy chance in a million.

‘It is quite clear she was being well supervised at the time. It happened in a moment.’

He added:
'Anyone who has children, grandchildren, nephews and nieces knows that 
something like this can happen.

'I
cannot believe there is not a single parent who has not had to fish 
something out of a child's mouth. It was a completely freak accident.'

Speaking at the family's home in Saltley, Birmingham, Mr Mir said his daughter's death had 'killed all my happiness'.

He said he, his wife aged 34, and their son Faris, aged ten, and daughters Danya, nine, and Laiba, three, had all been left devastated by the death.

Mr Mir, aged 45, who works as a manager at voluntary organisation East Birmingham Community Forum, said he was at work when the tragedy happened.

In a statement read out to the inquest, Mrs Bibi said the day before she had bought two small rubber balls for Kiran and one for her other children, paying 20p each for them.

She said the following day she had collected her children from school, taken them back home and was changing their clothes.

Mrs Bibi said: 'She was bouncing the ball between her hand and the floor. I suddenly heard Kiran cough and immediately looked towards her.'

She said her daughter continued to cough and that she suspected Kiran may have swallowed the ball.

She added: 'I immediately approached her and used one hand to smack her gently two or three times between her shoulder blades hoping for the ball to pop out.'

However, she said, Kiran's lips started to turn blue and she could see she was having difficulty breathing.

Mrs Bibi said she took her daughter to the bathroom and that Kiran had tried to vomit. She then took her back in the living room and made further attempts to get the ball out, but realised that matters had gone beyond her control and phoned her husband.

Speaking at their home, Mr Mir said he told his colleague to call for an ambulance while he rushed home.

He said: 'Me and my wife carried on 
trying to dislodge the ball by hitting her on the back of the throat and
also putting our arms around her chest and back and pulling upwards.

'By now the ambulance came and they took over. In the ambulance Kiran had a cardiac arrest but the paramedics managed to get her heart started again.

'When she got to Heartlands her heart had been stopped for 29 minutes and they told us she had suffered brain damage so was transferred to another hospital in Stoke-on-Trent. It's just terrible, terrible. It's killed all my happiness.'

Mr Mir said his daughter was in intensive care overnight but the following day doctors said the brain damage was so severe she would never recover.

He added: 'Then we had to make the difficult decision to turn off the life support machine.

'I was really reluctant to do so but they said that way she could pass away in a dignified way.

'She was always very cheerful, a really happy and loving little girl. We miss her every day - especially her sister who was also her friend and they were always playing together.'

He said Kiran was also a popular motivated pupil at school and all the teachers and fellow pupils had been left devastated.

Mr Mir said a memorial bench had been put in the gardens of Shaw Hill Primary School in Alum Rock, where his daughter was a pupil.
