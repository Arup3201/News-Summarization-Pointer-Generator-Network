A primary school has banned its pupils from watching next week's solar eclipse amid fears the children will be blinded.

Whitchurch Primary School in Cardiff said it will not let children watch the natural display outside, even if they have bought special glasses with solar filters.

Instead, the primary school will show the eclipse on a live feed inside the school premises.

The partial solar eclipse is due to take place at 8.45am on Friday, March 20, and will be visible for thousands of kilometres.

The decision came following an email which was reportedly sent to the schools by Cardiff Council.

The memo advised schools  to read a leaflet from the Royal Astronomical Society on how to observe an eclipse safely.

Advice in the leaflet states that 'the sun is so bright that just looking at it can blind you, so you'll need to prepare beforehand'.  

A council spokeswoman said: 'We are not telling schools they should not allow children out. 

'We have left that decision to the schools. We are providing schools with a copy of the Royal Astronomical Society's advice.'

Cardiff Council sent advice to schools from the Royal Astronimical Society, explaining how the eclipse can be watched safely. Pictured: A solar eclipse in the Faroe Islands

It goes on to state 'there are various ways to observe it (the eclipse) safely, using both everyday materials and telescopes or binoculars'.

These can also include eclipse viewers, colanders, pinhole viewers, and mirrors. It is believed the schools were left to provide the equipment themselves. 

A second school in the area, Fairwater Primary School, said it would not be making any changes to the school day to accommodate the eclipse. 

Meanwhile, Bryn Hafod Primary School, also in the area, said it needed to do a 'health and safety assessment' before it would make a decision on whether to allow children to watch the eclipse.

During the landmark event, the Moon will pass between the Sun and the Earth, casting a deep shadow over the planet's surface in a partial eclipse.

Unlike 1999, it will not be a total eclipse over Britain, although that will happen over the North Atlantic and the spectacular event will finish over the North Pole. 

The next similar eclipse will not take place over Britain until August 2026.
