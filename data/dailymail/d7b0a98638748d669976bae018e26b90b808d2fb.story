A high-profile business associate brokered a multi-million pound deal between England footballer Ashley Cole and U.S. rap star Jay-Z appeared in court today charged with stabbing a teenager to death.

Christopher Nathaniel, 40, was one of nine men in the dock charged with murder and conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm following the murder Danny O'Shea, 18, in Canning Town, east London, last December.

Dressed in jeans and a black puffa-style
jacket Nathaniel, of Canary Wharf, east London, spoke only to confirm 
his name, date of birth and address.

Nathaniel has worked with many leading sports and show business stars and was involved with anti-knife crime meetings with former Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.

Last year he brokered a deal, believed to be worth several million pounds, allowing Chelsea star Cole to open a London branch of U.S. rapper Jay-Z's 40/40 restaurant and bar franchise.

After clinching the deal, he said: 'We 
have done some exciting deals and worked with some world class names, 
but this collaboration of Ashley Cole and Jay-Z has to be one of the 
most exciting and it makes the nine months of negotiations worth it.'

He was also a director of former England footballer Rio Ferdinand's Live The Dream Foundation, which helps disadvantaged youngsters and is understood to have acted as middle man in a book deal for another England defender, John Terry.

He was initially arrested by police at Heathrow airport in March in connection with the killing of Mr O'Shea, who was stabbed in the neck outside his mother's house after being chased down the street by a mob.

Mr O'Shea's stepfather desperately tried to stop the flow of blood and gave him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, but it was in vain.

Paramedics fought for 30 minutes to save his life, but he was pronounced dead at the scene in front of horrified neighbours.

Nathaniel had just returned from the U.S. when he was seized in March. He and eight other men were formally charged when they answered their bail yesterday.

Nathaniel has also represented Jamaican sprint star Usain Bolt as well as Manchester United Footballer Antonio Valencia and Birmingham City defender Curtis Davies.

He is the head of the NVA Entertainment Group, based in London's Canary Wharf, which is believed to have worked with celebrities including Jordan and girl band Misteeq.

The day before his initial arrest he wrote on a social networking site: 'Dnt surrender dnt give in persevere no matter how difficult ur life is with perseverance u will get thru anything.'

His representative explained that the tweet was just some inspirational advice from Sir Alex Ferguson he had recently read in The New York Times.

Paul Johnson, 33, of Harrow; Kevin 
Richards, 32 of Willesden, north-west London; O'Neil Wareham, 29, of 
Harrow; Andrew Johnson, 35, of Harrow; Ferron Perue, 23, of Birmingham; 
Nugent Rowe, 29, of Pinner; Paul Boadi, 33, of Poplar, and David Hylton, 47, of central 
London also appeared for a short hearing at the same court.

Jonathan Efemini, prosecuting, asked for the case to be transferred to the Old Bailey where a bail hearing will take place on June 25

District Judge Nina Tempia remanded all nine men in custody until then and set a plea and case management hearing for September 25th.Â 

As he left the dock straight-faced Nathaniel mouthed 'Thank you' to his lawyer.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
