Fortnum & Mason has been the royal grocer for more than 150 years, but the top food emporium has been forced to make a grovelling apology to the Queen after it was exposed for wrongly claiming to sell meat from Her Majesty’s farms.

This column discovered that the Windsor estate stopped supplying lamb, pork and bacon to Fortnum’s in August after being constantly ‘bullied’ into cutting its prices.

However, the expensive grocer in London’s Piccadilly then began sourcing its pork and bacon from elsewhere in the country while its labels falsely claimed that the produce still came from the Royal Farms.

It withdrew these labels last Thursday only after my investigations began into its suppliers.

‘The Royal Household stopped selling Royal Farms meat to Fortnum & Mason on August 9,’ confirms a Buckingham Palace spokesman, declining to say if it is considering legal action against the store, which holds two royal warrants.

Last Thursday, nearly two months after the final delivery of Royal Farms meat to Fortnum’s, well-heeled shoppers could still buy what it claimed was ‘Windsor smoked streaky bacon’ and ‘Windsor green streaky bacon’ for £14 a kilo — double the price of bacon in one of the big supermarkets — as well as ‘Windsor Estate belly pork’.

The meats were labelled as being ‘From the Royal Farms in Windsor Park, Berkshire’. Fortnum’s now says the belly pork comes fom a supplier about 150 miles away in Norfolk and the bacon from Gloucestershire.

‘There was an unintentional error with product labelling,’ claims a spokesman for Fortnum & Mason. ‘As soon as we became aware of the issue, we apologised to the relevant parties at Buckingham Palace.’

Fortnum’s is owned by Wittington Investments, parent company of discount clothing chain Primark.

The controversy is another blow to consumer confidence after last year’s horse meat scandal in which some of Britain’s best-known supermarkets were discovered to be selling beef products contaminated with pig and horse meat.

A Royal Farms source says it decided to end its decade-long relationship with Fortnum’s after the grocer began bullying its suppliers by rounding down the prices it paid for pork, bacon and lamb. Fortnum’s spent an annual £300,000 on Royal Farms pigs alone, receiving deliveries of fresh meat six times a week.

A spokesman says it will give refunds to ‘any customer who can demonstrate proof of purchase’, adding: ‘We take the provenance of our products very seriously and obviously never meant to mislead our customers.’
