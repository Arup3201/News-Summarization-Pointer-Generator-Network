The world’s largest ice sheet could be more vulnerable to the effects of climate change than previously thought, according to new research.

British scientists used 50 years of declassified spy satellite imagery from 1963 to 2012 to create the first long-term record of changes of where glaciers meet the sea along 3,355 miles of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet’s coastline.

The East Antarctic Ice Sheet holds the vast majority of the world’s ice - enough to raise global sea levels by more than 50 metres - and the researchers warned the ice could be affected by rising global temperatures.

The world's largest ice sheet could be more vulnerable to the effects of climate change than previously thought, according to new research by Durham University

Using measurements from 175 glaciers, the researchers from the Geography Department of Durham University were able to show that the glaciers underwent rapid and synchronised periods of advance and retreat which coincided with cooling and warming.

The team said this suggested that large parts of the ice sheet, which reaches thicknesses of more than two-and-a-half miles could be more susceptible to changes in air temperatures and sea-ice than was originally believed.

Current scientific opinion suggests that glaciers in East Antarctica are at less risk from climate change than areas such as Greenland or West Antarctica due to its extremely cold temperatures, which can fall below minus 30C at the coast and much colder further inland.

But in a study published in Nature journal, the Durham team said there was now an urgent need to understand the vulnerability of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet.

Dr Chris Stokes, of the university's geography department, said: 'We know that these large glaciers undergo cycles of advance and retreat that are triggered by large icebergs breaking off at the terminus, but this can happen independently from climate change.

'It was a big surprise therefore to see rapid and synchronous changes in advance and retreat, but it made perfect sense when we looked at the climate and sea-ice data.'

He explained that when temperatures rose the sea-ice decreased and most glaciers retreated, while in cooler temperatures the sea-ice increased and the glaciers advanced.

A satellite image from 2000 shows several major East Antarctic outlet glaciers flowing through the Southern Cross Mountains, Victoria Land, and out across the Ross Sea. These glaciers are located in the coldest part of the study region and did not exhibit any clear trends in advance or retreat, unlike those along the much warmer western Pacific coast

'In many ways, these measurements of terminus change are like canaries in a mine - they don’t give us all the information we would like, but they are worth taking notice of,' said Dr Stokes.

The researchers found that despite large fluctuations in terminus positions between glaciers - linked to their size - three significant patterns emerged.

They discovered in the 1970s and ‘80s, temperatures were rising and most glaciers retreated but during the 1990s, temperatures decreased and most glaciers advanced.

The 2000s saw temperatures increase and then decrease, leading to a more even mix of retreat and advance, according to the research.

Here, Valley glacier in the Transantarctic Mountains enters the Ross Ice Shelf. Using measurements from 175 glaciers, the researchers were able to show that the glaciers underwent rapid and synchronised periods of advance and retreat which coincided with cooling and warming

Trends in temperature and glacier change were statistically significant along the East Antarctic Ice Sheet’s warmer Pacific Coast, but no significant changes were found along the much cooler Ross Sea Coast, which might be expected if climate is driving the changes, the Durham researchers said.

Dr Stokes said: 'If the climate is going to warm in the future, our study shows that large parts of the margins of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet are vulnerable to the kinds of changes that are worrying us in Greenland and West Antarctica - acceleration, thinning and retreat.

'When temperatures warm in the air or ocean, glaciers respond by retreating and this can have knock-on effects further inland, where more and more ice is drawn-down towards the coast.

'We need to monitor their behaviour more closely and maybe reassess our rather conservative predictions of future ice sheet dynamics in East Antarctica.'
