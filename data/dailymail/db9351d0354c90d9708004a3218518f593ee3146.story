As Daily Mail diarist Sebastian Shakespeare revealed in his column this morning, the busy Beckhams have proved a touch forgetful when it comes to their pets.

Family goldfish Juliet has spent the last month ensconced in a tank at their London neighbour's home after Victoria dropped her off on Boxing Day and forgot (or so we assume) to pick her up.

'You can forgive the Beckhams for being a little distracted following their move to a new £30 million mansion in London’s Kensington,' wrote Shakespeare. 'But could they not spare a thought for their lonely goldfish?'

He continued: 'Victoria dropped off the pet fish with a neighbour to look after for the holiday season on Boxing Day last year — and is yet to reclaim it.'

'The goldfish just came with some fish food,’ says neighbour, military historian Adrian Weale, who lives on the street in Kensington where the Beckhams rented prior to their move.

‘We believe it belongs to their son Romeo, so we’ve called it Juliet.’

Mr Weale, who with his wife is caring for the fish, added: ‘It seems quite chirpy, but I can’t help thinking it’s pining for its celebrity lifestyle.’

And it seems Mr Weale could be correct. Speaking to Shakespeare, animal psychologist Dr Roger Mugford revealed the fish may indeed be pining for its ritzy owners.

‘Goldfish are pretty adaptable. But they are also incredibly olfactory. They notice smell, lighting, pollution,' he explained.

‘So this fish could pick up the different body perfumes in its new home, as odours can dissolve in the water in their tank.’

Mugford also believes Juliet needs a piscatorial pal, reports Shakespeare.

‘I think it’s a bad idea to keep just one goldfish — they are fundamentally sociable animals. And it is horrible to think about a fish swimming round and round in circles with nothing to do. They need structured tanks with places to hide, and architecture to explore.’

Adds Mr Weale: ‘The fish came in a plain bowl, but we’ve bought it a tank with a filter as the water was getting murky. We’re happy to keep it, but it would be nice too, if they came to collect it.’
