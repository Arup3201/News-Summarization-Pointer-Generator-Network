The birthplace of angling  - complete with a 400-year-old ‘temple’ honouring the inventor of fly-fishing - has been put on the market for £450,000.

The stone temple was built in the 17th century in honour of author Izaak Walton, and as a place to rest and take shelter on the banks of the River Dove, in Staffordshire.

Walton, the author of the angling 'bible', the ‘The Compleat Angler’ (sic), would spend hours on the banks with landowner Charles Cotton - who
 built the retreat in 1674 in honour of his friend.  Their initials are 
carved in stone about the doorway of the Grade II listed stone-built 
structure.

Whoever
 buys the idyllic fishing retreat will not only own the three mile stretch of the riverbank, the fishing 
rights, and the Grade II listed fishing lodge, but also 33 acres of  unspoilt woodland and 
grassland.

Tranquil: The unofficial birthplace of angling, complete with its 400 year old 'temple,'  built in the 17th century in honour of author Izaak Walton, is up for sale for £450,000

Historic: The quaint interior of the temple with open fireplace. Walton, the author of the angling 'bible', the 'The Compleat Angler' (sic), would spend hours on the banks with landowner Charles Cotton - who built the retreat in 1674 as a place for he and his friend to shelter as they fished

The sale includes three miles of beautiful unspoiled riverbank, stretching alongside River Dove in Staffordshire

Its
 current owner, 80-year-old Michael Collins, said he runs the venue more as a 
hobby than a business.

But now
 facing retirement and with two of his three children voting to sell the
 fishery, it has gone on the market. The temple has been owned by the family since 1953.

Mr Collins employs a keeper to look after the fishery and maintain its banks and hopes the new owner will retain his services.

He said: 'This is the cream of game fishing. It
 is positioned at the head of the river where you aren’t bothered with 
any coarse fish that live in the bigger rivers like pike. It is purely game fishing, trout and grayling, which are wild and are not farmed.

'It’s lovely scenery and history makes it a very sought-after venue to fish.'

Walton’s tome  - the so called bible for anglers - was published in 1653 after he and his friend Cotton spent many hours experimenting with methods of fishing at the idyllic spot.

The temple even bears the crest ‘Piscatoribys Sacrum’ (Sacred to Fishermen) over the door.

In the mid-17th century Charles Cotton, an author, inherited Beresford Hall which was a quarter of a mile from the River Dove.

Mr Collins said: 'Cotton was so impressed with Walton and the way he taught him to fish using a dry fly that he adopted him as his father in the fishing field and they became great buddies.

'He built the fishing lodge down by the river and their initials were carved above the door and the fire place.

'The temple is just four walls and a roof with a stone table and fire place.

'It was a place to shelter in and take a break and have a spot of lunch. You can imagine servants coming down from the main house with trays of meats and cheeses.

'Walton wrote the Compleat Angler which is the Bible for all game fishermen.

'He pretty much invented dry fly-fishing and mastered how to attract fish by laying an artificially fly on the surface of the water very gently - there is a great skill in doing this.

'He also passed on tips such as the fisherman disguising themselves in khaki colours and bending down on one knee or behind a bush.'

'When the Compleat Angler was re-published in 1676, Walton was too old to contribute to it so Cotton added new chapters about trout flies and techniques for tying them.'

In 1953 Mr Collins' grandfather Walter, a keen angler, had the opportunity to buy Beresford Fishery which he passed on to his grandson in 1967.

Mr Collins, a retired businessman, said: 'It is run more as a hobby and as a pleasure than a business but over the years it has paid for itself.

'There is no limit at all on the number of fishermen who can fish on it but I don’t want a 100 men fishing the river so I restrict the numbers.

'I have three children; two of them want me to sell it and the other wants to keep it but they have been outvoted.'

Jonathan Bengough, of estate agents Knight Frank, said: 'The Beresford Fishery has about three miles of superb wild trout fishing on the River Dove.

'At its heart is a Fisherman’s Temple which is of huge historical significance and its three beats each have contrasting qualities, enough to challenge any keen fly fisherman.'
