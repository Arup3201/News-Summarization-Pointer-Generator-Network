Dozens of secret files that could hold vital clues about police corruption in the Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry were never disclosed to an investigation into the case, it has emerged.

A total of 41 boxes of documents – sent to the national archives at Kew several years ago – were not examined by the officials behind a damning review published last week.

Mark Ellison QC, whose findings prompted Home Secretary Theresa May to order a public inquiry into undercover policing methods, became aware of the existence of the boxes only as he was preparing to publish his report this week, and did not have time to look at them.

Some of the files are so sensitive 
they carry warnings saying they cannot be viewed until the end of the 
century.

But they could be unsealed as part of the public inquiry into 
undercover policing ordered last week by Mrs May.

Furthermore,
 the documents could be even more important because other vital 
paperwork was shredded by the Met more than a decade ago.

The
 Ellison review found the Met under John Stevens’ stewardship authorised
 the ‘mass-shredding’ of documents from a four-year inquiry into 
corruption during the 1990s.

There
 were hopes last night the files at Kew could contain evidence against 
former Detective Sergeant John Davidson over his actions as the murder 
inquiry began.

The former 
officer is suspected of links to the gangland father of one of the 
Lawrence suspects but the Met has previously denied he was involved. 
However, documents emerged at the weekend showing he tasked junior 
officers in the key initial stages of the 1993 inquiry.

Mrs
 May, who has been personally shocked by the revelations, has pledged to
 bring in a new criminal offence of police corruption.

Senior
 officers have promised they will get to the bottom of corruption 
allegations for the first time, after years of denial and botched 
attempts.

Dr Richard Stone, a
 member of Sir William Macpherson’s team who first probed the Lawrence 
murder in 1999, warned Mr Ellison about the missed documents.

He
 said: ‘He was unaware of the documents at the National Archive and said
 he would not have time to look  at them before his report came out.  I 
have seen some of the documents at Kew and they are very interesting. 
Some clearly have very important information in them but restrictions 
mean they won’t be released for 84 years.’

It is not clear exactly what restrictions have been put in place on the files, and why.

Dr
 Stone remains convinced that the Macpherson inquiry was hampered from 
getting to the truth about the killing of the black teenager and is 
considering calling for an inquiry into the way civil servants handled 
information relating to the case.

He
 added: ‘Now I am almost certain that senior Home Office civil servants 
played “Yes, Minister” games with us from the very beginning of the 
inquiry.’

The existence of 
the forgotten documents emerged as the authorities came under huge 
pressure to finally take decisive action in the aftermath of the Ellison
 report. It found officers spied on the Lawrence family, with an 
undercover officer passing on personal details such as comments on the 
separation of Stephen’s parents.

Home Secretary Theresa May ordered a public inquiry into undercover policing methods following the review, but it was revealed that the heavily censored hoard of information was not available to Mark Ellison's inquiry team. Now it has been revealed that unexamined evidence could be more important than the shredded evidence

Officials
 also raised concerns about the Met’s record-keeping on its own 
investigations into police corruption, with key evidence destroyed 11 
years ago.

The focus is now 
on the potential damage inflicted to the Lawrence murder inquiry by 
corrupt officers linked to the unsolved murder of private investigator 
Daniel Morgan.

Met chief Sir
 Bernard Hogan-Howe said he ‘fully supports’ the public inquiry and said
 his force must ‘share everything’ with it and other investigations.
