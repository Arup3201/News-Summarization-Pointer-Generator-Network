The influx of migrants from Eastern Europe has fuelled a huge rise in the number of schoolchildren who do not speak English as a first language.

In five years between 2008 and 2013 the number of Eastern European pupils who don’t speak English at home almost tripled from just over 44,000 to more than 123,000.

Astonishingly, one in nine English schools now has a majority of pupils who do not speak English as a first language. The official figures lay bare the enormous strain mass migration has placed on our schools.

The number of pupils who speak Romanian as a first language has seen the steepest increase – rising 527 per cent in five years. The number using Bulgarian at home has risen by 255 per cent.

However, the Education Department figures – obtained by the Daily Mail under Freedom of Information laws – only cover the five years before labour market restrictions on both countries were lifted last month, meaning the trend looks set to continue.

Schools are already struggling to cope with the demand for places, with some having to teach pupils in temporary classrooms.

Official estimates suggest that more than one million extra places will be needed in Britain over the next decade, which will bring the total required to eight million by 2022, the highest for 40 years.

The Government is already having to spend £5billion by 2015 on increasing the number of places to help ease the crisis.

Concerns have also been raised about the impact of the rising numbers on other services, including the NHS and social housing.

Educating children who do not speak English as their mother tongue also puts a huge financial strain on schools.

The cost of educating a non-native speaker has been estimated at up to £30,000 a year, compared to around £5,000 for other pupils, because of the need for intensive classroom assistance.

Anastasia De Waal, of think-tank Civitas, warned the strain on resources was damaging the education of both English children and those from recent migrant families.

‘In too many cases our schools are simply not set up to accommodate very high proportions of children who start school without fluent English,’ she said.

‘Those who lose out most in this scenario are these very pupils, as they don’t receive adequate opportunities to develop their English language skills and are therefore at risk of going through the education system at a significant disadvantage.

In turn, in an environment where teachers are struggling to cope because they are not given the time and facilities they need to strengthen language, those pupils for whom English is their first language can also suffer educationally and by default be neglected.’

Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real English, said non-English speaking immigrant children ‘often bring an excellent work ethic to the classroom’.

But he said: ‘It means a lot of teacher time has to be spent addressing language issues.’ The total number of pupils whose second language is English went up by a fifth to 1.1million between January 2008 and January 2013.

Nine of the ten fastest-growing foreign first languages are from Eastern Europe – the exception being the southern Indian language of Malayalam.

The second highest increase in pupils with English as a second language was among Latvians, on 414 per cent, followed by Hungarians, with 359 per cent. In both cases exact numbers were not recorded initially as they were below 1,000 – suggesting the percentage increase could be even higher.

Rising demand for school places has been caused by a growing birthrate, immigration and the fact that ever fewer middle-class families can afford private education.

But as well as the number of families migrating to Britain, further pressure is created by the high birthrate among those families once they have moved, the Office for National Statistics has said.

Romanian women on average have 2.93 children here compared to 1.25 at home. British women average 1.84 children.

Employment figures on Wednesday showed the number of Romanians and Bulgarians working in the UK rose by 40 per cent last year to 144,000.

Last year five primary schools were identified as not having a  single pupil whose mother tongue is English. There were also 240 schools where at least 90 per cent of children grew up learning another language.

The number of languages and dialects spoken in primary and secondary schools is now 309, ranging from Afrikaans and Amharic, from Ethiopia, to Shqip, from Albania and Kosovo, and Zulu.
