A giant volcano that covers the same area as the whole of the UK has been discovered buried deep beneath the Pacific Ocean.

Tamu Massif sits 1,000 miles east of Japan, along the Shatsky Rise plate, its tip is 6,500 feet below the ocean surface and it stretches around 400 miles wide.

After studying rock samples, scientists from the University of Houston believe the behemoth is the volcano that caused the underwater Shatsky Rise mountain range to form between 130 and 145 million years ago and may be the largest volcano in the solar system - even wider than the giant Olympus Mons volcano on Mars.

The Tamu Massif volcano sits under the Pacific along the Shatsky Rise plate. Scientists from the University of Houston made the discovery, which remained hidden because Tamu Massif sits 6,500 feet below the surface. Scientists used core samples, radars and scans, pictured, to map the volcano's size

Tamu Massif is the largest feature of the Shatsky Rise mountain range, marked by A on this map, situated around 1,000 miles east of Japan. The range was formed following the eruption of the Tamu Massif volcano between 130 and 145 million years ago

Tamu Massif covers an area of about 
120,000 square miles - an area roughly equivalent to the British Isles.

It is 400 miles wide and its tip sits 6,500 feet below the ocean's surface.

Tamu Massif is also thought to sit in water around four miles deep.

The
 largest volcano on Earth is Hawaii’s Mauna Loa that covers 
approximately 2,000 square miles - just two per cent of the size of Tamu
 Massif.

The Olympus 
Mons volcano on Mars isn't as wide as Tamu Massif -  stretching 370 
miles across -  but it's overall mass is approximately 25 per cent 
larger than Tamu Massif.

Tamu Massif is around 145 million years old but 'became inactive 
within a few million years after it was formed'.

William Sager, a professor in the 
Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the university, began studying
 the volcano 20 years ago.

Tamu Massif is the largest feature of the Shatsky Rise, which was formed following the eruption of 
several underwater volcanoes.

Until now, scientists were unsure whether Tamu 
Massif was a single volcano, or was made up of multiple eruption points.

The team of researchers studied core samples, radars and 
data collected from the region to confirm that the huge mass of basalt that makes up the volcano erupted from a single source near the centre.

Sager said: 'Tamu Massif is 
the biggest single shield volcano ever discovered on Earth.

'There may be larger volcanoes, because there are bigger igneous 
features out there such as the Ontong Java Plateau, but we don't know if
 these features are one volcano or complexes of volcanoes.'

Sager continued that Tamu Massif stands out among 
underwater volcanoes not only because of its size, but also its unusual shape.

This chart shows the Tamu Massif's location along the Shatsky Rise - a mountain range beneath the Pacific. A single eruption from the volcano is thought to have caused the range to form between 130 and 145 million years ago. The chart also shows Tamu Massif's relative size to Mars' Olympus Mons volcano

It is said to be 'low and broad', which suggests the erupted lava flows would have travelled longer distances compared to other volcanoes known about on Earth.

Other underwater volcanoes are predominantly small and steep.

'It’s not high, but very wide, so the 
flank slopes are very gradual,' said Sager.

'In fact, if you were 
standing on its flank, you would have trouble telling which way is 
downhill.

'We know that it is a single immense volcano constructed from 
massive lava flows that emanated from the center of the volcano to form a
 broad, shield-like shape.

The Olympus Mons volcano on Mars, pictured, is thought to be the largest in the solar system. It is around three miles narrower than the Tamu Massif but has an overall mass thought to be 25 per cent bigger

The next largest volcano on Earth is Hawaii's Mauna Loa, pictured. It covers 2,000 square miles - around two per cent of the size of Tamu Massif

Before now, we didn't know this because 
oceanic plateaus are huge features hidden beneath the sea.

'They have 
found a good place to hide.'

Tamu Massif covers an area of about 
120,000 square miles - an area roughly equivalent to the British Isles.

The largest volcano on Earth is Hawaii’s Mauna Loa that covers approximately 2,000 square miles - just two per cent of the size of Tamu Massif.

The Olympus Mons volcano on Mars isn't as wide as Tamu Massif -  stretching 370 miles across -  but it's overall mass is said to be approximately 25 per cent larger than Tamu Massif.

Sager added that Tamu Massif is around 145 million years old but 'became inactive 
within a few million years after it was formed'.

The
 project was funded by the National Science Foundation and the findings appear in the Nature Geoscience journal.
