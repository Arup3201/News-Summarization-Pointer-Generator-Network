Marquez started on pole but trailed Jorge Lorenzo for much of the race before finally passing his fellow Spaniard on a straight with seven laps to go.

The pair then traded the lead several times before Marquez finally surged in front for good around the outside of the Mugello circuit's first turn.

Marquez, who rides for Repsol Honda, clocked 41 minutes, 38.254 seconds. Lorenzo finished 0.121 behind and seven-time world champion Valentino Rossi was third, 2.688 back.
