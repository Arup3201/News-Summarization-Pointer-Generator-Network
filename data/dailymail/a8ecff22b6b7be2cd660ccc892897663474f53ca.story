No Spain striker had ever taken so long to score his first international goal but  Diego Costa has finally done it, getting off the mark for his adopted country after 515 minutes in the red shirt.

In a 4-0 win against Luxembourg, Costa had toiled for 70 frustrating minutes, burying his head in his Spain shirt after one horror miss, but failing to bury a single chance. 

It seemed the Premier League’s top scorer was going to continue saving all his goals for Chelsea, but the 26-year-old opened his international account with a scrappy second half goal in the rain at the Stade Josey Barthel.

It took Fernando Morientes just two minutes to get off the mark for Spain, the great Alfredo Di Stefano did it in 47 minutes, former Manchester City striker Alvaro Negredo in 77 minutes, Spain’s all-time leading scorer David Villa in 210 minutes and Fernando Torres in 220. 

Costa was starting to resemble Torres in his worst days at Chelsea and he had also drawn blanks in his brief dalliance with the Brazilian national team, failing to score in two friendlies. 

He was mobbed by ecstatic team-mates when he finally broke his duck after Gerard Pique and Sergio Busquets had seen their shots blocked, before the ball fell to Costa inside the six-yard box and he rifled it home.

For the Chelsea marksman it was more relief than celebration and when he made way for Valencia striker Rodrigo with 10 minutes left, he looked as if a massive weight had been lifted from his shoulders.

The goal should have come much earlier. He nearly scored on 11 minutes when he got his head to a cross from David Silva but Luxembourg goalkeeper Jonathan Joubert made the save. He then shot from distance but the shot struck a defender and bounced safely into Joubert’s hands.

The Chelsea striker came into the game having had 18 shots without a single goal - in sharp contrast to nine goals from 22 shots for Chelsea. He was playing without his club team-mate Cesc Fabregas, left out of Vicente del Bosque’s team. 

With the provider of so many of his goals on the bench, he tried to turn provider himself for Paco Alcacer but the young Valencia striker playing alongside him failed to get on the end of Costa’s cross.

After some intricate play on the edge of the Luxembourg area between Alcacer, Koke, and Andres Iniesta the ball fell to Costa and again he got his shot away well, only for Joubert to save.

In Fabregas’s absence, Silva was finding himself in more central areas and he smashed home Spain’s first from the edge of the area. The Manchester City man has now scored 22 goals for Spain - of non-strikers only Fernando Hierro has scored more in Spain’s history.

The goal calmed Spain’s nerves but not Costa’s who snatched at his next chance, running on to Pique’s long pass but not making a clean connection with his shot.

His next miss was worst. Another long ball out from the back found the forward in a central position inside the area but his attempt to lift it over the goalkeeper and into the far corner ended with his shot going well wide. Costa buried his head beneath his Spain shirt as team-mates on the pitch and on the bench looked on in disbelief.

De Gea was in for the dropped Iker Casillas and he had so little to do he could have taken Roy Keane’s autobiography on to the pitch. But he was tested late in the first half, tipping Daniel Da Mota’s cross-shot just over his bar as the home side finally threatened.

Luxembourg are not quite the whipping boys they once were - only two of the last six teams to visit them have come away with a victory, but against a determined Spain side coming into the game having lost four of their last six matches, they were two down before half-time.

And as if to make things even worse for Costa, who by now had had seven efforts on goal, it was his strike partner Alcacer who got the second making it three goals in his first three games since his debut.

In the second period Costa added the third before substitute Juan Bernat got goal number four. 

The Bayern Munich full-back had managed to find the net on his debut. It had taken Costa a little longer. But the striker Spain persuaded to defect from Brazil, only to see him fail to spark in his home land at the World Cup, is finally up and running.
