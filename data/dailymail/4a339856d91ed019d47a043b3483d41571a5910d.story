The boyfriend of murdered landscape architect Joanna Yeates has spoken of his heartache at losing her - nearly a year after she was found murdered on Christmas Day.

Greg Reardon, 28, told for the first time how the couple would probably have married one day.

Miss Yeates's body was found by dog walkers on a snowy verge in Failand, near Bristol, last Christmas Day. In October, the couple's neighbour Vincent Tabak was jailed for life for killing her.

During Tabak's trial, the jury heard he strangled Miss Yeates, 25, in a violent confrontation at the flat she shared with Mr Reardon in Clifton, Bristol.

He then span a web of lies and deceit to cover his tracks - taking her body back to his flat, then going shopping in Asda with her in his car boot.

Within an hour, he had dumped her partially clothed corpse on the verge and just 24 hours later was drinking champagne with friends.

During the trial, it emerged Tabak was obsessed with images of women being strangled during sex.

Mr
 Reardon met Miss Yeates in 2008 after they both started working for the
 BDP architecture firm in Bristol. He described her as modest, 
conscientious and laid-back.

In an interview with The Sun, he said: 'The thought of proposing had crossed my mind although it was probably some time off.

'It was more about taking things one step at a time and seeing where life took us than having a 'five-year plan' or whatever.

'My mum and dad were very proud of me for finding such a nice girl.'

He said he and Miss Yeates, who was a landscape architect, were planning to spend Christmas with her parents David and Theresa in Hampshire.

Mr Reardon was visiting his brother in Sheffield when Tabak murdered his girlfriend.

Killer: Tabak strangled Miss Yeates and dumped her body on a snow-covered verge

He had said during the trial how he 
was not instantly concerned when he came back to find the flat empty, 
but started to panic when he called her mobile and heard it ringing in her
 coat pocket.

When he found her glasses, purse and keys, he realised something was seriously wrong.

He said: 'At the first police press 
conference on the Tuesday, when I saw all the cameras I just thought, 
"I've seen this type of story before. I know how it's going to end".'

He said he cursed 'the probability of the situation more than anything'.

'Why couldn't we win the lottery 
instead?" he added. 'It's probably just as feasible as getting murdered 
by your next-door neighbour.'

The 28-year-old was praised, along with Miss Yeates's family, by police for his dignity during Tabak's trial.

He told The Sun he felt a huge release of tension after the trial and was glad of the result.

Mr Reardon, who has returned to work and has bought a flat in Bristol, said he still visits Miss Yeates's grave.

He said: 'I'm not sure specifically what I'll do to remember Jo in the future, but I'm certainly not going to forget her.'

He has helped raise thousands for the charity Missing People and is supporting its latest campaign Join The Search.

The
 group, which offers a helpline for those forced out of their homes by 
tragedy or social problems, needs to raise money to help find the 5,000 
people who go missing every year.
