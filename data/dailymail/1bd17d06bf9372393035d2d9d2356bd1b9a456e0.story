Amnesty International has concluded that Hamas committed war crimes during the 2014 Gaza conflict by firing rockets 'indiscriminately' at civilian areas and using non-combatants as human shields. 

'In launching these attacks, [Palestinian jihadis] displayed a flagrant disregard for international humanitarian law and for the consequences of their violations on civilians in both Israel and the Gaza Strip,' said Philip Luther, Amnesty's director for the Middle East and North Africa.

The report concluded that rocket attacks had killed six civilians in Israel, including a child. Other rockets aimed at the Jewish state fell short and killed at least 13 Palestinian civilians, 11 of them children, on the beach in Gaza, in an attack that was wrongly blamed on Israel.

War crimes: Amnesty International has found that Palestinian militants displayed 'flagrant disregard for international humanitarian law' by firing rockets from civilian areas into civilian areas

Pain: Family members and relatives of four-year-old Daniel Tregerman, who was killed by shrapnel from a Palestinian rocket, mourn during his funeral in 2014

Deadly: A rocket is fired from Gaza City towards Israel. Amnesty International described them as 'indiscriminate', and said that they killed more Palestinians than Israelis when they misfired

Palestinian witnesses had claimed that an Israeli F-16 warplane had killed Palestinian civilians on the beach. But the Amnesty report has corroborated the Israeli army's account of events, which said that the deaths occurred when militants misfired their own rockets.

'An independent munitions expert who examined the available evidence... concluded that the projectile used in the attack was a Palestinian rocket,' the report said.

It confirmed that during the 50-day war, Palestinian terrorists launched unguided rockets and mortars from civilian areas toward other civilian areas, constituting a breach of international law.

Figures released by the Israeli army after the war ended on 26 August showed that Gaza militants fired 4,591 projectiles at Israel.

Of those, 3,659 struck Israeli territory and 735 were intercepted by the Iron Dome air defence system, leaving another 197 falling short and landing inside the coastal enclave.

Militant groups used unguided projectiles which were 'inherently indiscriminate,' the report said, noting that this is 'prohibited under international law' and 'constitutes a war crime'.

Luther demanded that Palestinian armed groups 'end all direct attacks on civilians', and take all feasible precautions 'to protect civilians in the Gaza Strip from the effects of such attacks', including launching attacks 'within or near densely populated areas.'

Other war crimes committed by Palestinian terrorists  included storing munitions in civilian buildings and U.N. schools and launching attacks from areas densely populated with civilians, effectively using them as human shields. 

Luther called on both Israeli and Palestinian authorities to cooperate with U.N. and International Criminal Court probes 'to end decades of impunity that have perpetuated a cycle of violations in which civilians on both sides have paid a heavy price'.

Hamas official Taher al-Nounou denied the allegations in the Amnesty report, saying that Hamas did not target civilians. An Islamic Jihad spokesman, Daud Shihab, said that the rocket fire was in self-defence, and did little damage in comparison to Israel's weapons.

The 50-day Gaza war claimed the lives of about 2,200 Palestinians and 73 Israelis.
