A celebrity chef is being sued after allegedly firing a night cook from his staff at a Manhattan boutique hotel while the man was on leave caring for his dying wife.

Robert Esselborn says Anthony Paris, who won the Food Network's Chopped in 2010, dismissed him while he was on family medical leave from his job at the upmarket Crosby Street Hotel in December 2013, just one day before his wife died.

According to suit filed in Manhattan Supreme Court, on December 19, four days after Esselborn requested time off to care for his critically ill wife and their two children, Paris emailed him demanding to know when he would be returning to work.

Esselborn explained that his wife Barbara was on life support in hospital and that he would reassess the situation on January 1, reports the New York Post.

Paris then fired him, telling him the wait was 'too long,' and demanded he clean out his locker, despite knowing that Esselborn's wife was on life support. Barbara Esselborn died the following day.

'The Esselborn family was in a total state of shock and turmoil,' according to the wrongful termination suit.

'[Esselborn] needed to care for his wife and children. He also needed to make critical decisions about how to medically care for his wife and what her wishes would be under the circumstances.'

Barbara Esselborn, Robert Esselborn's
 wife of almost 17 years, became seriously ill on December 15 and was 
rushed to hospital with chronic organ failure.

'Over
 the next 48 hours, the doctors had discovered that her vital organs 
were shutting down and that her lungs and throat were infected,' the 
filing reports. She then had a stroke and doctors told Esselborn his 
wife was brain-dead.

On December 23, father-of-two Esselborn received an email from the HR department saying he'd been 'absent from work without notification,' reports the New York Daily News.

Just over an hour later, Esselborn received an email from Paris telling him to disregard HR's email.

'I appreciate your situation and 
value you as an employee, that's why we have waited. But at this time we
 cannot wait until Jan. 1, 2014 for you to reassess your situation, we 
will take this email as your resignation letter,' he wrote.

Esselborn
 responded to Paris, telling him 'the situation with my wife's health is
 critical at this time' and that he required family medical leave.

The
 HR department responded, telling him he was not eligible for family 
medical leave and that his position was terminated, reports the New York
 Daily News. Barbara Esselborn was taken off life support the next day.

Under New York's Family and Medical Leave Act, employees are entitled to take 12 weeks of 'unpaid, job-protected leave' annually for various situations, including 'to care for the employeeâ€™s spouse, child, or parent who has a serious health condition.'

The suit claims that Paris 'willfully' failed to inform the HR department of Esselborn's request for family medical leave 'in an effort to retaliate against Esselborn for exercising his federally protected right,' reports the New York Post.

'Then I heard nothing,' Esselborn told the Post. 'No card, nothing, just "Turn in your key and have a nice day."'

Esselborn's wrongful termination suit claims he was eligible for family leave because he had worked more than 1,250 hours at the hotel restaurant during the year he'd been employed there.

The suit seeks unspecified damages from Paris and the Crosby Street Hotel 'for intentional, outrageous and extreme conduct.'

Neither Paris nor the hotel responded to requests for comment.
