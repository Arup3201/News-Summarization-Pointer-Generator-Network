The accused heroin dealers who police believe may have sold drugs to actor Philip Seymour Hoffman underwent a radical courtroom makeover before their arraignment in a Manhattan courtroom.

Max Rosenblum, 22, was sporting a slick new haircut compared to previous courtroom appearances where he looked decidedly scruffy.

Both he and Juliana Luchkiw, also 22, appeared in smart, black business suits.

Meanwhile, a third 'dealer', Robert Vineberg said that his heroin addiction was a major factor in his alleged crimes, and asked for the case to go to a drug court designed to channel users to rehab instead of prison.

'Mr.
 Vineberg is desirous of confronting and successfully dealing with his 
substance abuse problem and becoming a sober, again-productive member of
 society,' wrote his lawyer, Edward Kratt.

The Manhattan district attorney's office hasn't yet responded to the request, and a judge hasn't yet ruled.

Vineberg,
 57, is a longtime jazz and pop studio musician who has played, under 
the name Robert Aaron, on albums by artists including David Bowie, Mick 
Jagger and the late Amy Winehouse. But his musical career has foundered 
in recent years.

As police 
followed a tip after Hoffman's Feb. 2 death in an apparent heroin 
overdose, they said they found about 300 one-dose packets of heroin and 
$1,300 in cash in Vineberg's apartment and music studio.

He's
 facing felony charges of possessing heroin with the intention to sell 
it, but he's not charged with any role in Hoffman's death.

Vineberg's stepdaughter Christine Soto admitted that Hoffman had visited 
the apartment where her stepfather sold drugs before adding: 'But he had
 nothing to do with what killed him.'

Luchkiw and Rosenblum, both 22, were formally charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance.

'Yes, he got a haircut,' said Rosenblum’s lawyer, Daniel Hochheiser, adding that will ask the court to review the grand jury testimony and then move to dismiss his client’s indictment.

They both were far more clean-cut in appearance than their previous court hearing.

Luchkiw donned a trim-fitting black suit and black leather boots while Rosenblum sported a more stylish look.

The pair quickly rushed out of the building - separately - with their parents and lawyers.

During earlier proceedings, Luchkiw had called her arrest 'retarded' and was visibly upset that a judge initially denied her bond.

'Why is this happening? I can’t spend another night in here!' she wailed at the time.

She and Rosenblum remain free on bail after the brief proceeding before Justice Edward McLaughlin.

Court documents revealed that in addition to two bags of cocaine, cops found a bag of marijuana and a scale in their apartment.

If Vineberg, who pleaded not guilty 
Tuesday, is approved for drug court and succeeds in treatment, the 
charges could eventually be lowered or dismissed. He's being held on 
$200,000 bond.

Vineberg has 
said he was a friend of Hoffman's but has denied providing the heroin 
that authorities said they found in the Academy Award-winning actor's 
apartment. Vineberg told the New York Post in a jail interview that his 
last contact with the actor was a December exchange of text messages 
about attempts both were making at sobriety.

New
 York state has long had drug-court programs, but a 2009 change in the 
state's drug laws gave judges more discretion to send nonviolent, 
addicted offenders to treatment, on the theory that it would work better
 than prison at stopping them from reoffending. About 2,600 people 
statewide were approved for drug court treatment in 2010, more than 
twice as many as in 2008, according to a state Division of Criminal 
Justice Services report.

Two
 of Vineberg's neighbors, both 22, were arrested in the same 
investigation and charged with possessing two bags of cocaine. They were
 also in court Tuesday; their lawyers plan to file papers fighting the 
misdemeanor charges. The attorneys have said the two had no connection 
to Hoffman.

Two law enforcement officials said at least one of them had the actor's phone number.

Investigators zeroed in on the four after a tipster, responding to publicity about Hoffman's death, told police he had seen Hoffman at the lower Manhattan apartment building where they were arrested and he believed that's where Hoffman got the heroin, the officials said Wednesday.

In searches of two apartments in the building, police found hundreds of packets of heroin in one of them, according to a criminal complaint.

Not involved: Christina Soto says her stepfather did not sell the drugs that Hoffman overdosed on

'This case and the charges against Mr Vineberg have absolutely nothing to do with the death of Philip Seymour Hoffman. ... We're hoping the (district attorney) will not use Mr. Vineberg as a scapegoat,' said his lawyer, Edward Kratt, who declined to say whether Vineberg knew Hoffman.

On
 hearing news of his tragic death on Sunday, Soto remember that her 
stepfather said: 'If he would have come to me, I would have told him to 
slow down, and if you’re going to do something, make sure you have 
someone with you.'

Hoffman,
 46, was found dead at his $10,000-a-month West 
Village apartment surrounded by 70 bags of heroin and 20 used syringes.

Vineberg was granted bail on February 14 after his February 4 arrest.

His lawyer told the judge that the 300 bags of heroin found in his apartment were for personal use.

Justice Edward McLaughlin said the claim was dubious.

'If he has an incessant, uncontrolled heroin addiction, then lying around with 300 bags of heroin, he would be dead,' McLaughlin said, reported the New York Post.

'If he has no job that produces income and has $1,500 or $1,300 in cash, you draw your own conclusions.'

A group of about 20 musician friends were there to support Vineberg.
