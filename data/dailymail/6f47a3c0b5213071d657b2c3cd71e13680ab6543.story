As the resident builder on the  TV garden makeover show Ground Force, the pressure on Tommy Walsh was to complete an amazing transformation in record time.

So it's rather ironic that the first property development he embarked upon with his own cash took him a decade to complete. Tommy is now selling the three-bedroom house, which  he rebuilt from a dilapidated shell, for £299,950.

The project, ten minutes from Stansted Airport in the town of Great Dunmow, Essex, took  him so long because he was offered his life-changing role  on Ground Force in 1997 - just after he bought the building.

In its prime, the hit BBC show drew audiences of 12 million. Tommy, then a successful self-employed builder, was catapulted to fame alongside the original team of Charlie Dimmock and Alan Titchmarsh.

Tommy paid £29,000 for the near derelict building - which was originally used as a school within a Victorian workhouse complex. The workhouse was designed by renowned architect Sir George Gilbert Scott, who later created the iconic frontage at St Pancras station.

Tommy's building had stood empty for 20 years after a botched attempt to convert it into a home. He bought it directly from a bank after it was repossessed. 'It had failed to sell at auction and was completely uninhabitable,' he explains.

He had plans to turn it into a three-bedroom weekend retreat for his family, with the help of his father, Jim, also a builder and a manufacturer of building materials.

'Cement is in my blood. I was working with my dad on a Saturday from the age of four,' Tommy,  57, says. Applying for planning permission took more than two years because of the building's Grade II listed status.

'My dad and I used to come here in the winter months when filming was over,' says Tommy, pointing to photos which show his old Ground Force truck parked outside the building site.

Other snaps show Tommy's sidekick from the show, Willy, helping to install the spiral staircase which leads down to the basement, where they added a third bedroom.

It was a massive project - three-quarters of the building had to be completely rebuilt including the roof, chimney-stack and external walls. Tommy and his father painstakingly recreated original features such as the distinctive diamond pattern brickwork, cast iron windows and copings on the edge of the roof.

'The planners told me it was an improvement on the original design, which is something I'd like written on my headstone,' he says proudly.

Sadly Tommy's father never got to see him complete the project as he died in 1999 at the age of 77.

Once the house was complete, Tommy found his three children, now in their 20s, preferred to be at the family home in Hackney, East London, at weekends. So he let  the property for seven years. He is selling now because, as a landlord, he prefers his rental properties to be closer to his Hackney house.

Despite his fame, Tommy remains grounded. 'I still live in Hackney, where I was born and bred,' he says. 'Family life is important to me and simple pleasures like football and the odd beer. I'm not particularly extravagant.'

His home is a stunning four-storey, four-bedroom Victorian property that he did up himself. But he talks with disbelief about his nearby childhood home, bought by his father for £1,200 in 1956, which sold for £1.2 million three years ago: 'It's now worth nearer  £3 million. It's a shame because it means Hackney is now too expensive for a lot of the original inhabitants. Everyone deserves a right to expect a roof over their head.'

Ground Force finished in 2005 and Tommy went on to appear in several other property shows, although none ever quite as popular. He continues  to run his building business and is currently renovating two houses in  Hackney, which he will let out.

Once he sells in Great Dunmow, he has his eye on a flat, again in East London, overlooking the Regent's Canal in Bethnal Green. He plans to improve and extend it.

According to Martin Nash at selling agents Mullucks Wells, prices in Essex are increasing at a gentler rate than the current boom in the London market - and are still about five per cent below 2008 levels.
