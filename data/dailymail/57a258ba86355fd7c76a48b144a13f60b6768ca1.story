A police force has been criticised for sending an officer dressed in a fluffy taxpayer-funded wolf costume to try and break into homes as part of a security campaign.

Badsey the Wolf was deployed by Suffolk Police to patrol the streets of the Babergh area and shock villagers into realising how easy it would be for a thief to break into a home or car.

However, out of the 92 properties visited by the character in Long Melford and Lavenham he was able to break into just a handful, including one shed - where Badsey posed with the owner's fishing rod which had been left inside.

And the campaign was criticised by locals who took to the Force's Facebook page to ask why resources were not being put into increasing police patrols in the area.

'No amount of "securing" cannot be undone by readily available
 tools, bolt croppers and portable disc cutters are both very cheap,' wrote Kyle Smith.

'We 
need police, on patrol at night, and perhaps some streetlights again?'

Alexander Mednick added: 'The issue isn't that people don't secure their
 sheds. The issue is we don't have any police on the beat.'

Kevin Seggie asked: 'There are no police on the beat, crimes are being 
committed on a regular basis in the same areas, why on earth don't the police patrol these areas?'

And Martin Sawyer said: 'Is our police force policing Suffolk or a Kindergarten?'

Badsey was first introduced in September last year as part of a crime prevention took to highlight insecurities in areas hit by break-ins.

Over the course of two days, Tuesday, January 28 and Wednesday, February 5, police in Babergh visited a total of 92 homes to highlight insecurities in people's homes and vehicles.

Some 40 properties were visited in Laverham, including the unlocked shed where the fishing equipment was discovered.

Keys to a property were also found left in an insecure utitlity room, and at another home keys could be seen in the inside lock of a back door.

In Long Melford officers visited 52 properties where they found windows open at houses with no one at home and insecure garden gates leading to concealed gardens and outbuildings.

Fourteen vehicles were also checked, but these were all were found to be secure.

'Suffolk Police take burglary very serious as we know the devastating effect it can have on people and the feelings of violation that it can leave behind,' said a police spokesman.

'With this in mind we will do whatever we can to stop people from becoming a victim.

'Badsey the Wolf is a crime prevention tool used to raise awareness among residents of how leaving your property insecure can make it all too easy for a thief to enter. Since the initiative began we have visited over 130 properties and are sure that residents would prefer a police officer enter their home than a burglar.

'Despite our best efforts in the past to highlight the dangers of leaving property insecure it still occurs throughout the county and therefore we have to come up with new ways of raising awareness. If the initiative is now gaining media interest we would suggest it is working.

'Officers will always knock on the door of a property first and await a response. If there is no response then a uniformed officer will try the door to see if it is insecure. If this is the case they will enter, make sure no one is inside of the property before leaving a leaflet to explain that we have been and why.'

The spokesman added that there were no immediate plans for Badsey to make a return.

'I don't think there are any plans at the moment, we do it if we have a particular spate of burglaries,' she said.
