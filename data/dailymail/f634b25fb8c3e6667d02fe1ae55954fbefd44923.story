They are both wanted at Old Trafford next season, but that hasn't stopped Bayern Munich from using Thomas Muller and Toni Kroos to advertise their new home kit.

The German duo are two of a number of players reportedly unsettled under Bayern boss Pep Guardiola and are wanted by incoming Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal. 

But Bayern appear to be hopeful of 
hanging on to the duo after they promoted Bayern's new red and blue 
striped adidas kit alongside Bastian Schweinsteiger and David Alaba.

Earlier this week Muller played down reports linking him with a £37million move to Old Trafford.

'I didn't make these rumours up myself, so I don't particularly want to comment on them too much, but I'm definitely not about to jump ship at Bayern,' said the 24-year-old.

'That said, I can't make any guarantees (that I'll stay at the club) for all time.'

Muller and Bayern were chastened by their 5-0 aggregate defeat by Real Madrid in the Champions League semi-finals which led to question marks over the preferred style of boss Pep Guardiola.

They have enjoyed more success in the Bundesliga, however, winning the title and going into the final round of matches 19 points clear of second-placed Borussia Dortmund.
