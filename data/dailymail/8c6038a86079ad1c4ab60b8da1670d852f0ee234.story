Nelson Mandela's ex-wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela has launched a legal challenge against the former South African leader's will insisting she is entitled to the rural estate where he is buried.

The 77-year-old who divorced the late anti-apartheid activist in 1996, is demanding ownership of Mr Mandela's ancestral home in Qunu in the Eastern Cape.

Mrs Madikizela-Mandela claims that she bought the property in 1989, while her then husband was imprisoned in Robben Island, giving her ownership rights under traditional law.

It is thought that Mr Mandela left the home to his family trust and third wife Graca, who he married in 1998, although in the weeks after his death in December last year, there were reportedly attempts to try and block her from the property.

It was later revealed that Mrs Madikizela-Mandela was left nothing from her former husband's £2.4million estate, which was divided between his family, the ruling African National Congress party, former staff and several schools.

His homes in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Mthatha were also left to the family trust with instruction on who could live in each property.

Each of his six children and some of his 17 grandchildren received almost £180,000.

However, a letter from lawyer Mvuzo Notyesi said the Qunu house should be given to Madikizela-Mandela's two daughters, Zindzi and Zenani, and their children.

'It is only in this home that the children and grandchildren of Mrs Madikizela-Mandela can conduct their own customs and tradition,' said the letter.

'The children born in a marriage between Mr Nelson Mandela and Mrs Winnie Madikizela-Mandela shall be the joint custodians of the property, which devolve amongst their generations and generations,' it continued.

Mrs Madikizela-Mandela's lawyer said deputy chief justice Dikgang Moseneke, the will's main executor, had acknowledged receipt of the letter but gave no further details.

Graca Mandela waived her right to half of her husband's estate but took over their four properties in her native Mozambique, which were jointly owned.  

Firebrand 
Winnie attracted a great deal of criticism, not least in 1986 for 
endorsing the violent practice of ‘necklacing’ – burning opponents alive
 using tyres and petrol.

In
 1988 she was convicted of kidnapping and being an accessory to assault 
in connection with the death of a 14-year-old boy who was accused of 
being an informer, but her six-year jail sentence was reduced to a fine 
on appeal.

Their divorce was finalised six years after her ex-husband walked free, but Winnie fought the divorce in court and still uses the Mandela name, having added it to her maiden name.

The spat is the latest in a string of feuds between different factions of the Mandela family.

In one of the most damaging episodes, Mandela's oldest male heir - his grandson Mandla - exhumed the bodies of three of Mandela's children from Qunu and moved them to the nearby village of Mvezo, where Mandla had built a visitor centre dedicated to his grandfather.

As Mr Mandela lay in hospital on life support a year ago, a rival family faction led by Mandla's aunt, Makaziwe, won a court order for the bodies to be re-exhumed and returned to Qunu.

Two weeks after Mandela's death, South African newspapers reported that Makaziwe had changed the locks on the Qunu house to keep Mandla out and had written him a letter ordering him to remove his dogs from the property.

Makaziwe's lawyer did not answer phone calls and Mandla's spokesman declined to comment on the letter.
