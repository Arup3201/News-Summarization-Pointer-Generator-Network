Shocking news: That enchanting friend of the British gardener, the robin, is disappearing and an insalubrious monster, the pigeon, is taking over.

If you do not believe me, just look at the figures from last week’s RSPB’s Big Garden Birdwatch survey.

In the past 35 years, sightings of pigeons in our gardens has increased sevenfold, or a horrible 743 per cent, while robins have reduced their cheeky, inquisitive appearances by 45 per cent.

I suppose there’s someone who welcomes a pigeon into their garden. Probably the same person who feeds them in Trafalgar Square before retiring out of range.

But the truth is, pigeons are stupid, irritating, destructive and ugly.

The ugly part is worth pursuing because, objectively, they should be rather handsome — imagine one stuffed and put into a glass case, with its tightly packed blueish-grey feathers, its smart white collar and pink-tinged waistcoat. In life, however, they somehow end up being quite hideous.

Words like brutish come to mind — their lumbering walk, their heaving take-off into flight, their bullying of smaller  feathered friends on the bird table, their uncouth approach to building nests, their coarse cooing which can only appeal if heard from faraway woods on a good-tempered evening.

A faraway wood is just the place for them, but they think they should be in the garden. I concede this does show a certain amount of intelligence — they like seeds and young greens, which, in one form or another, are found in gardens, so they opt for the easy life.

But in doing so they drive us gardeners mad. How often does the conscientious, hard-working, home-owner in his veg patch find his spring plantings descended on by large fat birds unafraid of scarecrows or even waving arms!

I no longer have a vegetable garden. My pigeon problem is closer to home.

Decline: Robins have reduced their cheeky, inquisitive appearances by 45¿per cent

The stone walls of my house in Dorset are decorated with many different climbers. There is a wisteria, now more than 100 years old, growing along half the south-facing front of my house, which gradually gives way to a 40-year-old vine. On another side there is a Banksia rose and jasmine.

Elsewhere there are climbing hydrangeas and cotoneasters, which all add to the beauty of the golden stone.

The only trouble is that pigeons firmly believe that these climbers are there to provide support for nests.

Their approach to architecture is to throw random twigs at a couple of branches, and hope they turn into something to hold their eggs — and their lumpy, ungainly selves. At least this scatter-shot approach gives warning of their arrival. I keep a stick handy to poke out the nests before they become cosy.

Sometimes, if I have been away for a week or two, it may become a close-run thing between my stick and the arrival of the pigeon’s eggs. My conscience has allowed me to evict eggs, but never chicks.

Last year, the pigeons were on the winning side in this  eternal battle. Now I know why. According to the RSPB, there are 5,400,000 breeding pairs of wood pigeons in the UK.

Worse still for us pigeon non-fanciers, they are quite capable of having several families, with two or three eggs per nest, in the course of the year, particularly when the weather is mild.

I do not assert that the pigeons are intrinsically bad. They do not stick their eggs in other birds’ nests like the cuckoo. Nor do they behave like the top bird varlet, the jackdaw, which takes a malevolent pleasure in stuffing chimneys or any unsuitable cracks it can find with a massive cascade  of twigs.

But those birds have not risen to fifth place on the RSPB list. How long will it be before pigeons knock the blue tit off its perch at Number 1?

I didn’t always dislike them. In my childhood, I used to go out in the field and woods with my brothers who were shooting pigeons, and felt quite sad when they downed one.

I was fond, too, of reading stories about brave carrier pigeons that were such heroes in both World Wars. Even this year I was moved by the story of a World War I pigeon named Cher Ami that delivered his message despite being gravely wounded.

He was patched up and given a wooden leg, but died a year later — when it was discovered he was actually a hen, so should have been called Chere Amie.

I also understand that many people like pigeons — and not just on their dinner plate. My husband grew up in the North of England where there were always men breeding racing pigeons alongside their  allotments, and the racing business is still thriving.

The Queen has some of the most impressive racing birds in the country at her loft in Sandringham, and there is a multitude of internet sites offering well-bred racers for sale.

It strikes me that this may be a clue to the problem of the pigeons in our gardens: they are under-employed, under-exercised, used to loafing around and getting what they want without having to make much effort.

They should be bravely fighting for their existence, roosting in high trees far from predators — if only there were some — or, even more commendable, saving men’s lives in wars, or entertaining fans with their swift flight.

Instead they are spoilt, over-weight and greedy, barging their way onto bird tables and gobbling up everything in sight.

Even if you hang a pigeon-proof bird feeder from a bough, they still cause chaos, stomping about beneath it for any pickings and trampling everything underfoot — a disaster if that feeder happens to hang over a flower bed.

Moreover, they regularly steal my morello cherries before I can turn them into jam (I know I could use a net, but they always beat me to it).

Flying high: The Spotted Woodpecker has risen in the RSPB list of birds which are thriving in British gardens

In the summer I only have to take a deckchair and sit under a tree in a quiet corner of the garden for a pigeon or two to arrive over my head, clattering and banging among the leaves before embarking on a frantic cooing routine, which sounds more like a pneumatic drill.

The saddest thing about this rant is that I really do love birds. I would be prepared to love pigeons if there weren’t so many of them and they didn’t invade my garden.

I even planted a little wood to invite in birds and was thrilled to see in the RSPB list that the Great Spotted Woodpecker has moved up in the ranks. I suppose if there were hundreds of them tapping at every tree I might begin to be less keen on them.

I am sorry that the sparrow and the song thrush are decreasing in numbers. I am happy to say that in my garden there is no shortage of robins and it’s quite common to  see two of them fighting over territory on my wall.

My week is made if I hear an early cuckoo as I did last year, and I easily forgive its wickedly irresponsible behaviour. So my pigeon problem is essentially about numbers and habitat.

The only place I am able to admire pigeons nowadays is in Chinese paintings whose artists somehow manage to turn their annoying plumpness into stateliness. They are often paired with peonies or flowering cherry trees, which they inhabit with a proprietorial air, little round eyes gleaming complacently.

I think I could just about hang one of these.

But in the end I have to agree with that discerning writer Gertrude Stein who penned the one line that succinctly sums up my attitude to pigeons in the garden: ‘Pigeons on the grass, alas.’
