Stephen Collins has blamed three separate incidents of child molestation on 'exhibitionist urges', maintaining in a new interview that he is not a pedophile and crediting 20 years of therapy and faith for helping him move on from the 'unspeakable' acts.

The shamed former 7th Heaven star insists he has inappropriately touched a minor on only one occasion, in 1973, but went on to expose himself to two other underage girls between then and 1994.

During a taped sit-down with Katie Couric for 20/20, that will air in-full on at 10pm Friday, the 67-year-old - who is being investigated by the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department on molestation allegations but has not been charged with any crime - said that while his actions were 'terrible', he does not fit the definition of a pedophile.

'A pedophile is someone who is mainly or wholly attracted to children. I'm not,' he told Couric.

'I had a distortion in my thinking where I acted out in those ways. 

'But I'm absolutely not attracted, physically or sexually attracted to children. I'm just not.'

Confessional: Stephen Collins gives a taped interview for 20/20 where he denies being a pedofile, despite admitting to three separate incidences with underage girls between 1973 and 1994

Interview: Collins, of 7th Heaven fame, will appear on 20/20 in an interview with Katie Couric tonight,  where he says he's a changed man who hasn't touched an underage girl since 1994

The actor added that he has 'big boundary issues', but stressed he is not a sexual predator.

When pressed by Couric on reports that he was also attracted to young boys, Collins said he has never felt such urges.

According to Collins, the first incident occurred in 1973, when a girl had come to visit and stay with him and his first wife. After his wife had gone to sleep, he and the girl were watching TV together.

'I took her hand and moved it in such a way that she was touching me inappropriately,' he said. 

'I knew that something unthinkably wrong had just happened that I couldn't take back.'

He also said he exposed himself to a teenage girl in 1982 and another in1994.

He said he has had no such urges since 1994.

'I'm absolutely not attracted, physically or sexually attracted, to children. I'm just not.' 

Collins said he's been in treatment and religious counseling for 20 years.

'I'm a human being with flaws,' he said. 

'I have dealt with them very, very strongly and commitedly in my private life.'

Excerpts of the interview - which will stream on Yahoo tonight - have been released this week.

They coincide with a woman who claims to have been molested by Collins telling TMZ that the actor is lying.

The woman, who is in her 50s but has not been named, told the website Collins gain sexual gratification during the alleged incident and ejaculated while making her touch him inappropriately.   

Collins has previously said  'there was no gratification' during the three encounters he had - calling them an 'impulsive act' that's 'haunted' him ever since. 

The woman told TMZ: 'Stephen is minimizing the incident. It was not just a spontaneous touching ... that aggression resulted in him ejaculating.'

She also slammed his decision not to apologize to her and another girl he targeted, adding: 'His assertion that he wanted to avoid reopening an old wound seems nonsensical to me.' 

The woman refuses to believe there were just three victims - as Collins stated in a taped confession leaked to TMZ by his soon-to-be ex-wife Faye Grant during their bitter divorce proceedings.

She has filed a police report with the NYPD  - although it's believed any case would be rejected because of the statute of limitations. 

Scandal: Collins is best known for playing Reverend Eric Camden on long-running family drama 7th Heaven (left). Reports about his indiscretions first came to light in October when his estranged wife Faye Grant (pictured together-right) released a taped confession that was obtained TMZ

The woman adds: 'Why isn't he donating any disposable income, beyond what he needs to survive, to a child-abuse charity? Maybe he should at least try apologizing to his victims.' 

Collins first admitted to the three incidents in a lengthy confessional essay for People magazine.

None of his victims have ever publicly came forward.

In the public backlash to the TMZ tapes, Collins lost parts on TV show Scandal and in the sequel to the movie Ted, while re-runs of 7th Heaven were pulled from the air. 

'Forty years ago, I did something terribly wrong that I deeply regret. I have been working to atone for it ever since,' Collins wrote in People. 

Family values: 7th Heaven was a show about a pastor and his wife, raising their large brood of seven children. A young Jessica Biel (to Collins' right in a blue sweater) played the couple's oldest daughter. Collins says he never behaved inappropriately toward any of the young actresses on the show

He says he's decided to speak publicly about the reports because he believes some of his actions have been elaborated. 

'On the recording, I described events that took place 20, 32, and 40 years ago,' Collins adds. 'The publication of the recording has resulted in assumptions and innuendos about what I did that go far beyond what actually occurred. As difficult as this is, I want people to know the truth.' 

Collins says he was 25-years-old during the first incident in 1973.  

He says he exposed himself to the girl twice before, but took things to another level on the visit.

'It lasted less than a minute, during which there was no gratification,' Collins said. 'I then left the room. I had no further physical contact with her. It was a completely impulsive act and it's haunted me ever since to think of what I put her through.'

Over the next two decades, Collins says he continued to expose himself to two more teenage girls, once in 1982 and again in 1994.

'The first instance lasted second and the second about a minute,' Collins says of the indecent exposure. 'I had no physical contact of any kind with either girl. I don't say this to excuse what I did - it was inexcusable - but to clarify what actually happened.' 

Collins says the exposure in 1994 was his 'rock bottom' and what caused him to finally seek help for his deviant behavior.

For the past 20 years, Collins says he's been undergoing therapy and religious counseling, while praying and meditating every day.

These treatments, Collins claims, have worked and kept him from harming other young girls.

'Since that day in 1994, I have not had an impulse to act out in any such way.'

Collins has only apologized directly to one of his victims, who he says was 'extraordinary gracious', but has not reached out to the others for fear that he will be 'opening old wounds'.

The actor also describes how the recorded confession came to be. He says he and his wife Grant were undergoing marriage therapy sessions in hopes of healing their relationship.

The second follow-up session is when Collins says he and the therapist were taped by his wife without either of their knowledge.

The couple of nearly 30 years filed for divorce in 2012 but have been engaged in a heated legal battle over how to split their assets.

Grant, who is also an actress, is fighting for high spousal support payments of $13,000 a month, saying she is no longer able to make a living from her career when she took a break to raise their daughter.

She also says she only released the taped confession to police, when Collins allegedly denied to seek treatment for his issues. She denies ever turning the audio over to TMZ.

Collins says the release of the tapes in October led to confusion over when he exposed himself to the young girls, and if it was possible one of his young co-stars on 7th Heaven was a victim.

'I appeared for eleven seasons on a television series with a cast that included minor females in our TV family, and countless other young actresses throughout the show's eleven years. I never behaved inappropriately on or off that set - or on any set I've ever worked on.'

When the tapes were first released, law enforcement in New York and Los Angeles said they were investigating the claims.

But law enforcement sources who spoke with TMZ said that despite the taped confession, they felt Collins would not be charged and 'the cases will go nowhere'.

Los Angeles police investigated him in 2012 and reviewed their case in October but a spokeswoman said Friday there were no updates on its status. 

Los Angeles Sheriff's Department detectives also opened an investigation into Collins over an early 1980s incident, but as of Friday had not presented their case to prosecutors.

Collins and Grant remain in divorce proceedings.
