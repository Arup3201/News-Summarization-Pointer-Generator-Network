Car manufacturers may be working on eco-friendly cars using hydrogen fuel cells and ‘green’ electricity.

But three amateur inventors have come up with a steam-powered bike that uses sustainable wood chips for fuel.

The Cornish trio are testing their bike on local moorland and hope their biogas engine could one day be used to power homes and other machines in a more eco-friendly way than diesel.

A new approach to cycling: Three amateur inventors have come up with a steam-powered bike that uses sustainable wood chips for fuel. Richard Backborow, Graham Waldren and Mat Thompson are pictured from left to right

The machine is endorsed by celebrity chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and is a cross between a bicycle and trike.

It works by woodchips being burnt inside the contraption’s biomass engine, which gives off gas that is condensed into steam.

Rather than pedalling, the rider uses their feet to pump air into the ‘expansion motor’ to generate one horsepower – making the machine three times more powerful than the average cyclist.

Inventor craftsman Graham Waldren designed and built the bike with his friends Richard Blackborow, a gallery curator, and Mat Thompson, who works in healthcare.

They are currently testing their new technology on moorland near Zennor, Cornwall and hope one to day to see it power homes and other devices.

Mr Waldren said: ‘No-one has made any developments in steam technology for 200 years.

‘The motoring manufacturers are locked into what they are doing. The funding doesn’t exist for this.

‘Once we can put together the engine it will be a platform to demonstrate what we are doing and give us data.’

The bike can currently do around 25 miles for every 2.2lbs (1kg) of wood chips and takes about five minutes to start up.

Mr Thompson explained: ‘It won’t replace the car, it might not work for bikes, but [it may work] for a small generator, for taking you off grid.

The trio of inventors hope one to day to see their biogas engine power homes and other devices. Here, they release a flame from the prototype engine

‘We don’t have a lot of trees in Cornwall but there will be countries that could use this technology.’

The trio say renewable energy experts from the University of Exeter have expressed an interest in their designs.

They are currently raising funds via the Crowdfunder website for further research into the so-called Phoenix Project, which is backed by River Cottage boss Fearnley-Whittingstall.

He said: ‘I can’t resist getting behind these guys, if only so I can get a step closer to my dream of a carbon neutral wood-chip powered flail mower for River Cottage. And maybe an eco-jet ski.’
