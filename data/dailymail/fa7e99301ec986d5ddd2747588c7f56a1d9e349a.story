A jogger in Oregon thought he was struck in the head by lightning when he felt sharp pain in his scalp and his hat flew off his head. 

Then, it struck again - and this time he saw a large pair of wings soar away from his bleeding head.

Experts say Ron Jaecks, of Salem, was likely attacked by an owl - a night-stalking predator that normally aims its sharp talons at mice, not humans.

'It was like a huge electric shock ran through my body, but also like I got hit in the head with a two-by-four all at the same time. Or maybe a strike of lightning.' Dr Jaecks, a surgeon, told the Salem Statesman Journal. 

David Craig, a biology professor  at Willamette University, said Dr Jaecks as likely attacked by either a barred owl or a great horned owl - which can grow to have a wingspan of more than five feet. 

Their talons can grow up to eight inches long.

Dr Jaecks said the unexpected attack - combined with initially having no idea what hit him - caused him to run around in circles screaming.

He thought for a moment that he may have been having a stroke or an aneurysm. 

Professor Craig says he does not know why the owl decided to attack the innocent jogger. 

However, he said that such attacks are not unheard of - especially when the owls are nesting and become territorial. 

Dr Jaecks says he runs laps around the park every morning to stay into shape so that he can fit into his green and yellow spandex Green Bay Packers jumpsuit. 

He's never before had problems with being attacked by owls.
