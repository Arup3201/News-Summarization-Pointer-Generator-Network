The captivating motion of various satellites orbiting our planet has been revealed in a fascinating Nasa video.

Created by the agency’s Goddard Space Flight Centre in Maryland, it shows their entire Earth-observation fleet and the paths they take around Earth.

While the ISS sweeps across ‘diagonally’, in the video at least, others like the Landsat series are seen travelling from pole to pole.

Nasa scientists in Maryland, US have created a satellite visualisation (shown). It shows dozens of Earth-observing satellites currently orbiting our planet. They include Landsat 7 and 8, part of Nasa's long-serving series. And the ISS can also be seen sweeping diagonally across Earth

The animation solely shows Nasa's Earth-observing satellites, and not any run by other space agencies or private organisations.

The satellites measure rainfall, solar irradiance, clouds, sea surface height, ocean salinity and other aspects of the global environment.

‘Together, they provide a picture of the Earth as a system,’ said Nasa.

The animation shows the day of 16 February 2015 from 00.00 GMT to 12.00 GMT.

While the satellites might look close together, the amount of space in Earth orbit is vast, and there is little to no chance of any colliding.

In fact, they are all placed on specific orbits within their orbital bands that ensure the minimal chance possible of colliding with another satellite.

This doesn't always go to plan, though. In 2009, a US Iridium satellite and a defunct Russian Cosmos satellite collided, creating hundreds of new pieces of debris in orbit.

But the precision of modern satellites is best seen by a quartet of satellites known as the ‘A-train’ - Aqua, Aura, CloudSat and Calipso - which follow each other closely in their orbits.

The two closest, Cloudsat and Calipso, are just 12.5 seconds apart, but this equates to 58 miles (93km) in distance.

The four satellites work together to provide even better observations of Earth.

‘It’s acting like one satellite with 15 instruments onboard,’ Ernie Wright, an animator at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Centre, told Wired, referring to the 15 instruments shared between them.

The Landsat series of satellites have, since 1972, been used to measure Earth’s continental and coastal landscapes at a scale where human impacts and natural changes can be monitored. Shown is an illustration of Landsat 8, which launched on 11 February 2013

Construction of the ISS began on 20 November 1998.

It supports a crew of up to six, with crews split into groups of three.

The station orbits at a height of about 255 miles (410km).

It has a total mass of about 990,000 pounds (450,000kg) and has living space roughly equivalent to a five-bedroom house.

It completes an orbit of Earth every 92.91 minutes and moves at 17,100 miles (27,600km) per hour.

It has now been in space for more than 5,900 days, during which time it has completed more than 92,000 orbits of Earth, and has been continuously occupied for more than 13 years. 

Some satellites, like Landsat 7 and 8, orbit from pole to pole, known as a polar orbit. 

This allows them to see almost the entirety of Earth as the globe rotates underneath them.

The Landsat series of satellites have, since 1972, been used to measure Earth’s continental and coastal landscapes at a scale where human impacts and natural changes can be monitored.

The ISS, meanwhile, has a diagonal orbit that keeps it relatively near the equator, which enables various command centres across the world to stay in contact with the crew.

Recently launched satellites on the animation include the Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) mission, which measures the surface soil moisture on Earth, and was launched on 31 January 2015.

A full list of the satellites and their missions is available at Nasa’s Scientific Visualisation Studio website.

As the Earth rotates underneath, the ISS appears to move up and down in curves, although in reality it is always moving in one direction
