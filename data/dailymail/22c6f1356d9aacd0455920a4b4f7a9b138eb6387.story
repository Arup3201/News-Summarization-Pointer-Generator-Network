Stephen Myler is desperate to be offered the platform to show England he is equipped to be their World Cup fly-half.

Myler orchestrated Northampton's 19-12 victory over London Irish at the Madejski Stadium on Saturday with his 14-point haul restoring Saints to the Aviva Premiership summit.

England name their squad for the autumn series against New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia on October 22 with head coach Stuart Lancaster blessed with options at fly-half.

Owen Farrell is clear favourite to pull the strings at next year's World Cup, but the Saracen is currently struggling with a thigh strain and has also been hampered by a knee injury this year.

Snapping at his heals are George Ford, Freddie Burns, Danny Cipriani and Myler, who believes the chance to add to his solitary cap will enable him to press his own claim.

'I'm craving the opportunity. Once you get that opportunity it's up to you, but that's all I want,' Myler said.

'I'm not sure what's going on in the minds of the selectors, but I'm just playing the best rugby I can for my club.There are a few players who have been doing well in my position.

'That's good from a national point of view, but also personally because to be in contention you have to play the best you can.

'My aim is to play the best I can for Northampton and see where that takes me.'

Far less clarity exists at inside centre, a position that is giving Lancaster his most troubling headache.

One of England's options Luther Burrell used his speed and power to score the only try at the Madejski Stadium, but his handling was otherwise poor.

Kyle Eastmond is the Premiership's form centre and Lancaster is an admirer of Billy Twelvetrees is, but Myler views his Saints team-mate Burrell as an irresistible force.

'Luther has a lot of positive attributes and he's always trying to improve,' Myler said. 'Luther is a very physically capable man with good speed and good strength.

'He's deceptively quick. You wouldn't say that his main attribute, but he can move for a big man, so it's nice having him in the team.'
