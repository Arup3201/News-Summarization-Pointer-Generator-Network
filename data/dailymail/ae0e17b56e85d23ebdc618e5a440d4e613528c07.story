There are nearly as many Chinese students doing masters degrees in England as there are British students, it emerged today.  

In total, three quarters of all masters students at English universities are foreign, according to figures from the Higher Education Funding Council for England.  

However, the proportion of overseas student fell between 2010 and 2013 thanks to rising fees and tough new visa restrictions - the first fall in numbers for three decades.

The number of full-time postgraduate students from China studying in England last year was 28,390 - up nine per cent on the year before.  

Out of all students doing full-time taught masters degrees at an English university, 23 per cent were Chinese, compared to 26 per cent who were from the UK. 

Chinese students were most dominant in maths and media studies, making up more than half the total foreign intake, with high numbers in business, engineering and architecture.  

The proportion of Chinese students was boosted by a decline of around 50 per cent in the numbers coming from countries such as India and Pakistan.  

South Asian students traditionally favoured British universities thanks to cultural ties, but a tougher visa regime and a ban on students working in the UK after graduation is believed to have driven them away.  

Decline: The overall number of foreign postgraduate students has fallen for the first time in three decades

The overall number of postgraduates in England from outside the EU was 71,260, down from a peak of 72,245 in 2010-11.  

By contrast, other countries including the U.S. saw a rise in people coming to study, apparently benefiting from students shunning the UK.  

In addition, the number of undergraduate students coming from the EU fell by a quarter in 2012-13, apparently thanks to increased tuition fees of up to £9,000 a year.  

While EU citizens are not required to obtain a visa to study at English universities, they must pay the same fees as students from the UK, meaning the hike in prices has put them off.  

British students still dominate undergraduate courses, with 83 per cent of the total, while around half of those studying research-based masters degrees are from the UK.

The University and College Union blamed Government rhetoric on immigration for damaging Britain's international reputation as a leading destination for education.  

'International students make a huge contribution to academic and cultural life on campuses and in our cities,' said general secretary Sally Hunt.  

'They also make a valuable contribution to our economy. As we face continued uncertainty about the future of funding for our universities, the Government should be doing more to encourage foreign students.  

'Ministers need to recognise that attempts to sound tough on immigration at home are also reported elsewhere and it is not surprising if students consider studying in the countries that make an effort to welcome them.'  

Professor Madeleine Atkins, chief executive of the HEFCE, said: 'This new analysis from HEFCE expands our understanding of global demand for English higher education.  

'International students enrich our universities and colleges - and our society - academically, culturally, and through their contribution to the economy.  

'Supporting high-quality international education is a crucial part of ensuring that the UK continues to engage with, and benefit from, the increasingly interconnected world.'
