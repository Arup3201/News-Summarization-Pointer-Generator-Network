It was early evening and under the lights of the small, artfully shabby garden bar of the Chateau Marmont, troubled Hollywood actress Lindsay Lohan was drinking with close friend Lady Gaga.

‘Lindsay was on good form that night,’ said a friend who saw her. ‘Italked to her and her eyes were clear and she didn’t appear to be under the influence of anything.

‘She and Gaga seemed to be getting on like a house on fire. Gaga kept going behind the bushes to smoke, but Lindsay didn’t go with her.

REPUTATION: The Chateau Marmont hotel in West Hollywood

She was charm itself – laughing and joking like she didn’t have a care in the world.’

But not long after that night, Lohan, 26, was again in the news for the wrong reasons.

The Chateau – which has been her home for much of the past decade – told her she was banned from the premises, and details were leaked of her unpaid bill of more than £29,000, including room-service meals, £500 on her mini-bar in one night and £432 worth of cigarettes over 47 days.

Days later, she was accused of badly damaging a dressing room on the set of her latest film, Liz & Dick – a biopic of Elizabeth Taylor’s relationship with Richard Burton.

The quintessential Hollywood wild-child has long been better known for her drug-taking, car-crash relationships and multiple arrests than her acting work.

Yet even by her standards, this latest episode is remarkable.

Throughout its 80-year history, the Chateau Marmont’s reputation for hedonism has been matched only by its discretion.

Its celebrity guests know their sordid secrets – from trysts in lifts to drug overdoses – will remain within its turreted walls.

Every hellraising celebrity has stayed there, from Jimi Hendrix to Phil Spector and John Belushi.

None has ever been thrown out, until now.

‘Lindsay has been pretty much living at 
the Chateau for years, and during her worst periods, when she was taking
a lot of drugs, they always took care of her,’ says a source.

‘For her failure to pay this bill to have been made public shows that eventhe place she considers her home just can’t take any more of her.’

As a child, Lohan’s red hair and green eyes and natural comic timing earned her roles in hit films The Parent Trap, Freaky Friday and teen classic Mean Girls.

By the age of 18, she had netted a £20 million fortune.

But over the past few years, her drug and alcohol addictions have destroyed a promising career.

Her repeated attempts to revive her film career have been thwarted by her inability to change her lifestyle, which has led to three attempts at rehab, along with three stints in jail for driving under the influence of narcotics and, later, breaking the terms of her probation.

Last year, she pleaded guilty to the theft of a £1,500 necklace and was sentenced to 120 days in jail, which she served under house arrest.

A friend says: ‘Lindsay is genuinely trying to get back into her career, but Lindsay being Lindsay, controversy just naturally finds her. ‘She’s a Jekyll and Hyde character.

There’s the lovely Lindsay who is a charming and thoughtful friend, but she changes entirely when she’s taken something or drunk too much.

She surrounds herself with lackeys and hangers-on who sponge off her and don’t give her good advice.’

Lohan’s part of Elizabeth Taylor in Liz & Dick was seen as a major step towards salvaging her ailing reputation and proving she still has talent, but during filming in June, an ambulance was called to the Ritz-Carlton hotel where she was found ‘unresponsive’ in her room.

Her mother Dina claimed no drugs were involved, saying: ‘She was just exhausted.’

Her unreliability means most major film studios will not hire her because the cost of insurance is prohibitive.

‘It would be hard to think of a person more hated by Hollywood than Lindsay,’ one insider told The Mail on Sunday.

The only work she can get is low budget and often low-rent.

She is filming The Canyons, in which she has a topless sex scene with James Deen, a porn actor, and last year she posed naked for Playboy magazine.

Following her banning from Chateau Marmont, Lohan said she assumed the producers of Liz & Dick were covering the expenses.

The hotel’s management denied that a member of staff leaked the bill, saying copies were given to the media by one of Lohan’s team.

They added: ‘We are as horrified, disappointed and troubled by this occurrence as Miss Lohan surely is.’

By Thursday evening, there was little sign of the incident preying on Lohan’s mind as she partied until the small hours with socialite Nicky Hilton in the VIP area of New York nightclub 1Oak.

It looked very much like business as usual.
