Sportsmail asked Manchester United blog Stretty News about the club's stuttering start under Louis van Gaal.

The Old Trafford outfit were unbeaten throughout pre-season but lost their opening Premier League match 2-1 at home to Swansea. This was followed by a 1-1 draw at Sunderland on Sunday before suffering an emphatic 4-0 defeat at League One side MK Dons in the second round of the Capital One Cup.

Stretty News' Dale O'Donnell gives his insight as to what's wrong at the Red Devils. 

Manchester United have struggled to start the new season like they would have imagined after an impressive tour of the United States. The pre-season tour saw victories over Real Madrid, Inter Milan, Roma and Liverpool but the new season has popped up with defeats against Swansea and MK Dons.

Louis van Gaal is the only one that can explain what has changed in a matter of weeks, but when the 3-5-2 formation was introduced to the current United squad in Los Angeles, they put seven past David Beckham's former club LA Galaxy.

Throughout the tour, Manchester United played with a high intensity, attacked quickly in numbers and moved the ball exceptionally well.

VIDEO Van Gaal blames injuries, errors and luck

Then, once returned in Manchester, a friendly against Valencia was organised on request of Louis van Gaal. While they won thanks to a last minute winner by Marouane Fellaini, United performed poorly and the La Liga side looked a much more comfortable unit.

There was undoubtedly great excitement ahead of the new season under a manager full of experience at the top level. Van Gaal was also coming in with a change of philosophy and a similar aura to Sir Alex Ferguson.

Back in July, Van Gaal warned fans that it would take him three months to fix Manchester United and get them into shape.

'Every club where I have been, I've struggled for the first three months,' said Van Gaal, speaking in Washington DC.

'When we survive the first three months, it will be the same as for me as it was at Bayern Munich. At Bayern, after the first three months, we were sixth or seventh and we were third in our Champions League group.'

Bereft of ideas: David Moyes was sacked as United boss in April with the club languishing in seventh

I trust Van Gaal more than I ever did under the management of David Moyes. He is a proven winner that even has a nack for overachieving with average players. When you look at the Dutch national team from the World Cup, it was hardly a side full of world beaters aside from one or two. At United right now there are lots of deadwood and players that are struggling with confidence since David Moyes' reign.

In terms of giving Van Gaal time, he needs it more than ever. It can easily be argued that taking over from Moyes has been more difficult than taking over from Ferguson. The squad has withdrawn its bite and it's an even bigger ask to expect it back in one season.

Meanwhile, the new system requires specific types of players in each position. The back three does seem an issue but that was always going to be the case when you lose players like Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra. Thus far, two defenders have been brought in but United's defensive crop of selections lack that experience that proves vital in tough times like these.

Top talent: Summer signing Ander Herrera looks like a fantastic addition to United's midfield

In midfield we remain light. Ander Herrera has looked fantastic but is nowhere near the finished article. A signing such as Arturo Vidal or Nigel De Jong would accommodate him superbly and might even allow Louis van Gaal to play his preferred formation: 4-3-3.

And while these reasons go a long way to explaining why it was always going to be a difficult to start to life under Louis van Gaal, I doubt many fans expected struggle of this magnitude.

All football clubs go through transitions but that's not an excuse for losing games. Manchester United need a big win to give Van Gaal's players a boost. Roll on Burnley.
