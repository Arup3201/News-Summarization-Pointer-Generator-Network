'If our hearts could explode from love they would have already,' Ashley wrote on the Facebook dedicated to their journey. 'Everyday I don't think it's possible to love them any more than I already do and then the next day I find that I do!!!' 

Though faced with some bumps in the road, especially for the lightest baby Indie, but the couple are looking to their faith to stay strong.

'God has a plan for us, and he's trusted us with four babies,' Tyson Gardner said. 'We have faith in him, and we have faith in each other.'

Miracles: She gave birth 12 weeks early to two sets of identical girl twins named Esme, Evangeline, Indie and Scarlett

Mr Gardner, from Pleasant Grove, Utah, also thanked the doctors and nurses who delivered the babies.  

The couple have been sharing messages on a Facebook page charting the pregnancy, saying they are 'overjoyed' and that all four girls appear to have inherited their father's dark hair. 

The Gardners also shared that they will be featured on a TV series on the TLC network about the pregnancy, birth of their 'quad squad' and adventures over the coming months. 

The Gardners documented the pregnancy on YouTube, Facebook and a family website.

Mr Gardner wrote: 'We can't wait to have you all along on this journey!'

Photos of the couple looking shocked after receiving the news about their multiple babies gained wide attention online, and a Facebook page they set up for the babies has nearly 350,000 likes.

'People identify with our story. There are hundreds, thousands of people that struggle with infertility,' Tyson Gardner said. 'Our story's a story of hope.'

 'It was scary at first, and then, you know, the second you see the babies' faces and hear them cry, it just is, it's all worth it,' Ashely Gardner said, according to the Deseret News.

Doctors made the decision to deliver the babies by C-section after Ashley started experiencing  contractions early.

The couple became an internet sensation after they made a video earlier this year showing their startled but ecstatic reaction to the news that they had four babies on the way.

Mrs Gardner, who suffers from endometriosis - a condition which sees cells from the lining of the womb grow in other areas of the body - said she was shocked but excited to discover she was pregnant with quadruplets. 

The couple wrote in a Facebook post: 'We were so blessed to be able to do IVF the month of June! They put 2 eggs back and both split! That's right, we are having quadruplets! The odds of both eggs splitting are literally 1 in 1 million.' 

Since then, the couple have posted regular updates on the progress of the pregnancy, including themed snaps of Ashley in costume for Halloween and Christmas.  

The quadruplets' survival was called a 'miracle' after emergency surgery was needed to stop  contractions when Ashley was around 20 weeks pregnant.

The couple flew to a specialist center at Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital, where Ashley was admitted for surgery in late October.  

Doctors managed to stave off the earlier delivery after an intense operation, which allowed the unborn babies vital extra weeks to bolster their chances of survival. 

The couple posted a picture shortly before the birth with the message: 'Santa let the elves take over for a bit today so he could come visit us in the hospital!! #happy29weeks'

Festive: The couple, pictured above at Christmas just days before Ashely's contractions started, kept their huge Facebook following updated with topical pictures

Mr Gardner said doctors told his wife she needed immediate surgery after it appeared her cervix had started to open and she could be going into early labor. 

Surgeons also managed to cure two of the girls of their twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), which could have resulted in developmental problems.

In October, the Gardners posted on Facebook: 'It went great. Dr. Chmait smiled and said, ''This has been a good day!''

'Our tears have been replaced with relief and continue to pray for the babies safety and continued 'baking' for a good long time!!' 

The couple, who say the babies are doing 'great' and receiving 'fabulous care', have promised more updates when possible. 

How many?! The image above shows the moment Ashley discovered that her fertility treatment had gone rather better than she had expected

Unlikely: Ashley says that the chances of her conceiving the four girls - and them surviving to be born - is around 70million-to-one
