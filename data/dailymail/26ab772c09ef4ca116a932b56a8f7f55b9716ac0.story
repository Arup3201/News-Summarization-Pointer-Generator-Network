Far from being detrimental to health, enjoying S&M may make people less neurotic and more outgoing

Some may think it is perverse, but enjoying the snap of the whip
or the clink of chains on skin could make you more psychologically healthy than those
who enjoy a more mundane sex life.

A study found that BDSM - bondage, discipline, sadism and
masochism - enthusiasts scored better on a variety of personality and psychological tests
compared to those who did not have sexual fetishes.

Experts say this is because those who enjoyed kinky sex were
more extroverted, more open to new experiences and less neurotic.

Dr Andreas Wismeijer, a psychologist from Tilburg University,
found that  BDSM practitioners ‘either
did not differ from the general population and if they differed, they always
differed in the more favourable direction’.

Dr Wismeijer and his fellow researchers asked BDSM fans to undergo
a variety of psychological questionnaires online.

They also sought participants who did not do BDSM via a women's
magazine website, a personal secret website and a university website. 

Participants did not know what the surveys were about, other that
they concerned ‘human behaviour’.

In total 902 BDSM
practitioners and 434 non-BDSM participants filled out questionnaires on
personality, sensitivity to rejection, style of attachment in relationships and happiness.

The Dutch study also found that those who dominated in sex games were the most psychologically balanced. Those who were submissive were no less mentally balanced than the rest of the general population, however

The results revealed that on a basic level, BDSM practitioners are
no more troubled than the general population.

In fact they were more outgoing, more open to new experiences and
more conscientious than less adventurous participants.

They were also less neurotic, a personality trait marked by
anxiety.

Enjoying the clink of chains in skin can be a sign that you are mentally balanced

BDSM aficionados also scored lower than the general public on
rejection sensitivity, a measure of how paranoid people are about others
disliking them.

People in the BDSM scene reported higher levels of happiness in
the past two weeks than people outside it, and they said they felt more secure
in their relationships.

Interestingly, the role a person played when engaging in BDSM
behaviour seemed to be linked to a person’s psychological profile.

Dominants tended to be the most balanced, submissives
the least and switches (those who enjoy dominating and being dominated) were  in the middle.

But submissives never scored lower than the general population on
mental health, and frequently scored higher.

‘Within the BDSM community, [submissives] were always perceived as
the most vulnerable, but still, there was not one finding in which the
submissives scored less favourably than the controls,’ Wismeijer told LiveScience.

The findings were published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine.
