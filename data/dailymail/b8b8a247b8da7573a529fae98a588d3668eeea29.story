British workers have seen their wages rise by the lowest level for four years, while the cost of living continues to soar.

Wages increased by just 0.4 per cent in the first three months of 2013, including a fall in March.

New figures showed the number of people out of work rose by 15,000 to 2.52 million. The rate of unemployment rose to 7.8 per cent.

Wages: Average pay has gone up just 0.4 per cent during the past year compared to a 2.8 per cent increase in inflation. The fast rise in rents will compound the misery for many households

ages increased by just 0.4 per cent in the first three months of 2013, including a fall in March.New figures showed the number of people out of work rose by 15,000 to 2.52 million. The rate of unemployment rose to 7.8 per cent.

Total pay including bonuses from January to March was up just 0.4 per cent on the same period in 2012, the Office for National Statistics.

The rise was entirely fuelled by increase state-funded jobs, with employees in the private sector seeing no year-on-year increase in pay at all.

The figure for March alone showed a fall in pay of 0.4 per cent, the first negative since March 2009.The Consumer Prices Index, which tracks the annual rise in the cost of living, stands at 2.8 per cent.

It means wage rises are failing to cover rises in bills for food, housing and shopping leaving people worse off every month.

Labour MP Catherine McKinnell said in the Commons yesterday: 'Average earnings are rising at the lowest rate since the end of 2009.'

She pointed to a study by the Resolution Foundation, that warned the squeeze on average incomes is set to continue for many years.

'The foundation estimates that... the gap between what people earn and what they would have been earning had their wages risen in line with inflation will have risen to £3,200 by 2017.'

Average earnings excluding bonuses rose by 0.8 per cent, the lowest rise since records began in 2001.

TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ‘Those in work are taking a hammering in their pay packets with wage growth down to just 0.4 per cent, while prices rise far more quickly.‘It's no wonder the economy is struggling when people in work are getting poorer every month.’

After rising for previous quarters, the fissures showed a surprise fall in the overall rate of unemployment to 0.8 per cent

The figures also revealed that the number of people in work fell by 43,000 in the latest quarter to March, to 29.7 million, the biggest fall since autumn 2011.

Some 902,000 people had been out of work for more than a year, a 23,000 increase on the three months to December. The number of unemployed 16 to 24-year-olds fell by 17,000 to 958,000.

The government claimed there were now more than half a million job vacancies in the UK, the highest number since 2008.

The number of people claiming out-of-work benefit Jobseekers Allowance in April fell to its lowest level since May 2011, but still stands at 1.52million.

The drop in employment by 43,000 was blamed on a fall in part-time workers and government training schemes.

The number of people in full-time jobs rose by 10,000 on the quarter.

Employment minister Mark Hoban said: 'There are record numbers of women in work, fewer young people unemployed and more vacancies available for those looking for work.

Labour's Liam Byrne accused Tories of bickering over Europe while families were struggling

'We are also seeing continuing falls in the number of people claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance which is positive. Whilst there has been a disappointing increase in the headline rate of unemployment, we shouldn't forget the progress we are making.

'We are not complacent. To win the global race we need to do all that we can to help people achieve their aspiration to look after themselves and their families.'

The number of people classed as economically inactive, including students, people on long-term sick leave and those who have given up looking for work, rose by 47,000 to nine million.

Despite today's increase in unemployment, the total is 92,000 lower than a year ago.

The unemployment rate from January to March was 7.8 per cent, down from 7.9 per cent in December to February.

Liam Byrne, Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, said: ‘We now have definitive proof the Government has simply failed to get Britain back to work.’

He said the Government had done nothing in the Queen's Speech to help solve the ‘jobs crisis’ and instead Tory MPs were bickering over Europe.

‘Families struggling for work will be asking quite simply, what planet are these people on?’

However, Neil Carberry, director of employment and skills for the CBI, said: ‘Given the challenging economic conditions at the end of last year, it's unsurprising that we're now seeing fewer people in work.

‘What's encouraging, however, is that economic conditions seem to be improving and that full-time jobs are still being created.’

Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ‘Following recent positive news on the economy, today's UK labour market data provides something of a reality check.

‘There was a triple whammy of bad news, with employment in the three months to March down by 43,000 and unemployment up by 15,000. Meanwhile, the squeeze on real earnings has intensified.’
