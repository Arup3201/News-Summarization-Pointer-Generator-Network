In a proud ceremony that recognized his heroism in one of the bloodiest battles in the Afghanistan War, former Army Sgt. Ryan Pitts became only the ninth living recipient of the Medial of Honor to have served over the past decade.

Presented with the nation's highest military honor by President Obama, Sgt. Pitts was congratulated for his 'selfless service' by his Commander-in-Chief.

Obama said Pitts displays 'the humility and loyalty' that define America's men and women in uniform.

The president noted that the 28-year-old Pitts has said his honor belongs to everyone who was with him during the July 13, 2008 attack in Wanat, Afghanistan.

'That little post was on the verge of falling, giving the enemy a perch to devastate the base below,' Obama said in a White House ceremony. 'Against that onslaught, one American held the line.'

He called in for air support that helped repel the attack and prevented the enemy from taking his fellow soldiers who had been killed.

Obama honored each of those killed in battle with Pitts by name, and asked their families to rise and be recognized, including two of their children who have grown up without a parent. He also noted it was the second wedding anniversary for Pitts and his wife, who have a 1-year-old son.

'It's going to be tough topping this one, as anniversaries go,' Obama joked. But he advised Pitts, 'You should try. Don't rest on your laurels after just two years.'

Pitts was injured in the attack. But despite losing blood from wounds in both legs and an arm, he continued to fire at about 200 Taliban fighters and guided air strikes that helped repel the attack.

Last month, Sgt. Pitts said the military 'was the greatest thing I've ever done in my life,' said the married father. 'It was the honor of my lifetime to serve with those guys and I would do it all over again.'

The former soldier from Nashua, New Hampshire, spent 90 minutes fighting off the attack on July 13, 2008 - despite shrapnel injuries to both legs and an arm that left him critically wounded.

He said that the award also belonged to Sergio Abad, Jonathan Ayers, Jason 
Bogar, Jonathan Brostrom, Israel Garcia, Jason Hovater, Matthew 
Phillips, Pruitt Rainey and Gunnar Zwilling.

'While it is an honor to have been 
nominated for the award, it is not mine alone,' he said. 'The honor 
belongs to every man who fought at Vehicle Patrol Base Kahler, 
especially to those who made the ultimate sacrifice that allowed the 
rest of us to return home.

'I
 have an absolute responsibility to tell our story, because there are 
nine men who cannot and it is their names you should know.'

Pitts recalled the moment Garcia died.

'There
 wasn't really anything we could do for him other than for me to give 
him the guarantee that I would come home and tell his wife and mother 
that he loved them and that he was thinking of them in his last 
moments,' he said.

Pitts kept his word.

He said he initially wasn't happy to learn that his actions were being reviewed.

'I
 never felt that I deserved it but since then, I've accepted the fact 
that this isn't mine,' he said. 'It belongs to everybody who was there 
that day because we did it together.'

He maintains that while he hasn't changed because of the medal, his outlook is renewed.

Missed: Gunnar Zwilling, 20, from Florissant, Missouri, left, and Pruitt Rainey, 22, from North Carolina also died

Tragedy: Matthew Phillips, 27, left, of Jasper, 
Georgia was killed in the fight - one of the bloodiest battles of the 
U.S. war in Afghanistan. He perished alongside comrade Jason Hovater, 
25, right, of Clinton, Tennessee

'I know now that I'm going to live my life for those who aren't here because I owe it to them,' he said.

Pitts,
 who has fully recuperated from his injuries and is in business 
development at a software firm, was accompanied Thursday by his wife, 
Amy.

His face brightened 
when asked about life since the battle, clearly happy about his upcoming
 second wedding anniversary and their one-year-old son, Lucas.

When
 he someday tells the boy about what happened in Afghanistan, he said, 
'I don't want to tell him about my experiences. I want to tell him about
 the other guys.'

He 
added: 'I want him to know he's here because of their actions. It's the 
only reason he's here because a lot of those guys saved my life.'

Casualties: Jonathan Ayers, 24, of Snellville, Georgia and Jonathan Brostrom, 24, of Hawaii were also killed

Fallen: Jason Bogar, 25, served with the National Guard before joining the Army a year before his death

The medal recognizes the ‘courageous 
actions’ shown by Pitts while he served as a forward observer when 
Vehicle Patrol Base Kahler, near Wanat Village in Kunar Province, came 
under full-scale attack.

Deep into battle, Pitts found himself alone at the observation post and losing blood.

He radioed to tell his superiors that everyone else was either dead or gone, but was told reinforcements were not available.

Resigned to death, he began firing a grenade launcher almost directly overhead to where insurgents had concealed themselves.

He
 also used a tactic known as 'cooking off' grenades, pulling the pin and
 holding it longer than usual so the enemy couldn't throw it back.

Four soldiers soon made their way from the casualty collection point to find Pitts fighting for his life.

They
 were followed by attack helicopters that provided air support. Despite 
being nearly unconscious, Pitts stayed in touch with headquarters and 
provided the feedback that was needed to help guide the air strikes.

He
 was evacuated after fighting for more than an hour despite his wounds, 
along with three of the soldiers who came to his aid. The fourth soldier
 had been fatally wounded.

‘Throughout
 the battle, despite the loss of blood and severity of his wounds, 
Pitts' incredible toughness, determination, and ability to communicate 
with leadership while under fire allowed U.S. forces to hold the 
(observation post) and turn the tide of the battle,’ according to the 
military's narrative of the battle.

‘Without
 his ability to stay alert and fight while critically wounded, the enemy
 would have gained a foothold on high ground and inflicted significantly
 greater causalities onto the vehicle patrol base, and the enemy could 
have been in possession of seven fallen Americans.’

Pitts
 left the service in October 2009 and currently works in business 
development for the computer software industry. He joined the Army in 
2003 at age 17.

Last week, 
Obama awarded the Medal of Honor to retired Cpl. William ‘Kyle’ 
Carpenter, who lost an eye after taking a grenade blast in Afghanistan 
to save a fellow Marine.
