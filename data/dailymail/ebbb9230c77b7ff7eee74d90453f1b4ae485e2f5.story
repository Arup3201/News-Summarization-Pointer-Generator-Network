Poppy the cat who was officially recognised as the world’s oldest after making it to the age of 24 has died – just weeks after clinching the title.

The tortoiseshell was born in February 1990, the same month Nelson Mandela was released from prison.

She lived through five British Prime Ministers and was officially recognised by Guinness World Records on May 19.

But she died last Friday following a problem with her hind legs and a water infection.

Her owner Jacqui West, 43, said that although the family knew this day would come they are devastated at their loss.

She said: ‘We knew she was old but it’s still very upsetting.

‘She had a bad week last week. She was on antibiotics on the Wednesday because of a water infection and her back legs just seemed to let her down. She wasn’t herself at all.

‘She passed away on Friday at 3.30pm. I had spent the whole day with her as she was particularly poorly.

‘We knew it was going to happen but we’re all still completely devastated. It’s only just starting to sink in. 

‘It’s great she managed to get the world record beforehand, it’s almost like she was purposely hanging in there because the process took months.

‘We’ve buried her in the garden now, alongside all of the other pets we’ve had that have passed away.‘

Poppy picked up the title following the death of Pinky, a cat from Kansas who passed away at the age of 23 last year. 

The pet, who lived in Bournemouth, Dorset, was originally called Popsy and had two owners in her early days.

At the age of five she was adopted by Marguerite Corner and her daughter Jacqui. 

When she was ten she went with Jacqui who had moved in with future husband Andy West.

The couple now have two sons – Joe,11 and Toby, eight - and Poppy shared their home with four other cats, two rabbits and a hamster.

Mrs West, an accountant, added that her fellow feline pals were also missing her presence. 

She said: ‘We’ve got got four other cats at the moment. 

‘We’ve all taken the news very strangely - including the other cats. 

‘All of us are off food, the other cats didn’t eat all day on Friday and they all seem to be loitering around waiting for Poppy to come home. 

‘I think it is going to take us a little while to come to terms with it - it’s very said.’ 

The oldest cat in history was a feline called Creme Puff who lived in Austin, Texas and who survived for an astonishing 38 years and three days.

It is not yet known who will take the crown from Poppy. 

News of Poppy’s death comes just a day after the world’s oldest man, Alexander Imich, passed away aged 111.
