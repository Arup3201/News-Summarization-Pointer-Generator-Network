A Danish PhD student has been granted £300,000 to study 'actual relationships' with trolls

The Danish government awarded a £300,000 grant to a study into a study into the existence of trolls - and not the internet hate-mongers. 

Lars Christian Kofoed Rømer, a PhD candidate who has spent two years studying ghost activity, is now set to delve into the 'actual relationships' between humans and trolls on the Danish island of Bornholm. 

This does not sit well with the Danes as it follows severe cuts to health and welfare services with is set to see thousands of nurses lose their jobs in the coming year.

The island of Bornholm has a flourishing tourism business centred around the fact that it claims to be home to trolls that live underground and come out of night.

Kofoed Rømer, who also works as a part-time lecturer at the Department of Anthropology at the University of Copenhagen, will visit the island to, literally, look for trolls.

The money, 2.5million Danish kroner, is being paid by the state-funded Danish Council for Independent Research (DFF), which is part of the country's Ministry for Higher Education and Science. 

Kofoed Rømer has said that will mainly be looking at the relationship between the troll legends and the 'actual relationships' of those living on the island with the trolls.

He said: 'I think it is fascinating that the legend of the island's trolls continues to thrive in today's world and I want to look at the creatures' physical manifestations on the island and the way they are interacting with locals.'

DFF's chairman of the board, Peter Munk Christiansen, declined to comment on specific projects funded by the council but said that DFF has a wide definition of what constitutes a useful study.

'At DFF we believe that humanistic research should be funded on equal footing with all other research areas and we actually support that area more than we support societal research. 

'We profess a pluralism and broad coverage - we don't just pursue things that are the most popular right now.'

Island of the supernatural: The myths of trolls has made the island of Bornholm a tourist attraction

The decision to fund the 'troll study' has, unsurprisingly been met with a barrage of criticism from angry Danes.

Some have accused the Social Democrat-led coalition government of Helle Thorning-Schmidt of making cuts in health and welfare services, yet sanctioning spending of £300,000 on looking for fictional trolls.

DFF has an annual budget of 1.2 billion kroner (£130 million), 22.5 million kroner (£2.3 million) of which goes to PhD projects outside of the university system, like Romer's troll research.
