This albino kangaroo has given birth to an adorable dark joey at a German zoo.

Alberta, one of the most famous residents at the Marlow Animal Park, was captured carrying her baby joey in her pouch at the reserve.Â 

The rare Bennett's tree kangaroo is one of the star attractions at the park in eastern Germany and stands out due to her snow white coat and bright pink ears.

And she is sure to pull in more fans with her cute new dark joey.

But despite their fluffy appearance, albino kangaroos like Alberta aren't expected to survive for long if they live in the wild.

The marsupials' startling white coats are believed to attract a higher number of predators, including wild foxes, dogs and even eagles.

Albino kangaroos are very rare and don't have a long life expectancy if they are living in the wild

It is also thought they are more likely to develop skin cancer and sunburn, as well as having a genetic predisposition towards sight and hearing difficulties.

Albinism - characterised by a lack of the pigment melanin - is extremely rare within the kangaroo species, similar to other species.
