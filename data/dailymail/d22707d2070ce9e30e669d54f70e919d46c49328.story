Almost 1,500 foreign prisoners are being held in British jails after the end of their sentence because the authorities cannot deport them, new figures reveal.

More than two years ago David Cameron promised to tear up agreements that mean convicts cannot be returned home without their consent to cut costs.

It comes as ministers boasted that a wave of Albanian prisoners will be sent back to their home country to finish their sentences under a new deal signed today.

The UK Border Agency said deportation was often delayed by 'human rights challenges'

One in eight of all prisoners in 
Britain are from overseas, and 1,466 have completed their sentences but 
are being held behind bars while officials battle to have them kicked 
out of the country.

On average a prison place costs £40,000-a-year, meaning the taxpayer could be footing a bill of up to £60million.

Critics said the British public should not be paying to keep locked hundreds of offenders who should not be in the country.

Last year it emerged that despite the Prime Minister’s pledge to tackle the number of foreign prisoners, just 62 had been sent home.

In the last ten years, the number of foreign nationals in prisons in 
England and Wales has doubled to around 10,900 and now represents more 
than 14 per cent of the total prison population.

Ministers admitted that prisons and immigration removal centres were forced to detain foreign nationals because there was nowhere else for them to go.

Immigration minister Mark Harper could not say how long foreign criminals were being held after completing their sentence but Tory MP Priti Patel said it should be made easier to deport them

A total of 77 out of nearly 200 Albanian prisoners are currently eligible for transfer under the agreement between the two nations, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said.

The move, which is expected to save taxpayers around £25 million over the next 10 years, should see the first batch of prisoners deported in around two months time.

The compulsory prisoner transfer agreement, which will save Britain £2 million in the first year, was signed by prisons minister Jeremy Wright and the Albanian minister of justice, Eduard Halimi.

It is the first agreement providing for transfer from the UK to outside the European Union.

All eligible cases have been referred to the UK Border Agency for deportation, the MoJ said.

Mr Wright said: 'The co-operation of the Albanian authorities has been crucial in ensuring these negotiations have proved so fruitful.

'The British Government wants more foreign national prisoners to serve their sentences in their home country.'

Albanian nationals make up the 16th highest foreign national population in English and Welsh prisons.

Immigration minister Mark Harper said:
 ‘In September 2012, 547 foreign national offenders were detained by the
 UK Border Agency in prisons following completion of their custodial 
sentence.

‘A further 919 
foreign national offenders were detained beyond the end of their 
sentence in immigration removal centres.’ He could not say for how long 
they have been held.

However, the average number of days between a foreign national finishing a sentence and being removed fell from 131 days in 2008 to 74 in 2011.

Efforts have been made to speed up deportations by starting the process earlier. Anyone who is deported is subject to a re-entry ban, for a minimum of 10 years.

While numbers are down by around a fifth since April 2010, the Home Office admitted it was struggling to cut them further because offenders claim their human rights will be reached if they are sent home.

Tory MP Priti Patel, who obtained the figures, seized on the figures as proof the Human Rights Act needed to be scrapped.

‘Taxpayers should not be paying for foreign offenders to remain in the UK after their prison sentence has ended.

‘They should be deported from the UK straight away.

'While the reduction in the numbers remaining in the UK under this Government is welcome, the laws that block removals and enable foreign offenders to remain in Britain, such as the Human Rights Act, must be scrapped.’

In 2010 there were 701 foreign offenders 
detailed in jail after their sentence, which fell to 516 in 2011 but 
rose again to 552 in 2012.

The number of people held in immigration 
detention centres after completing a prison sentence has fallen from 
1,213 in 2010 to 812 in 2012.

David Cameron has been frustrated at the government's ability to kick out foreign criminals

A UK Border Agency spokesman said: ‘We will always detain foreign criminals awaiting deportation if they pose a risk to the public.

‘Those who abuse the privilege of coming to the UK by breaking our laws should be removed at the earliest opportunity and we are speeding up the deportation process.

‘Deportation can be delayed for many reasons, including human rights challenges and a lack of co-operation by the offender. This can lengthen the period of time an individual spends in immigration detention.’

More than 175 foreign criminals were deported under Operation Nexus, a 
joint initiative launched by the UK Border Agency (UKBA) and the 
Metropolitan Police Service at the start of September.
Among the criminals removed from the UK under Nexus were Indian national
 Manindhar

Annamdevula, 24, who was arrested for attempted fraud at 
Harrods in October, some five months after his visa had expired.

Shahnoza Sayfieva, 35, from Uzbekistan, was arrested in October on 
suspicion of blackmail and soon deported, while Ugandan Julius Amet, 36,
 was arrested in October for a public order offence and later deported.
