A train buff’s stunning collection of model steam engines that he used to drive around his back garden is set to sell for £250,000.

The late Jack Salem was a steam train enthusiast and over a 40-year period commissioned prominent locomotive builders to make the model engines for him.

The locos were exact working replicas of real engines from the ‘golden age of steam’ and many were built using the original drawings for the bigger versions.

After he sold the linen mill that he owned in Lancashire, Mr Salem retired to Switzerland where he had a half-a-mile long track, complete with stations, tunnels and viaducts, built in his garden.

The late Jack Salem was a steam train enthusiast and over a 40-year period commissioned prominent locomotive builders to make the model engines for him. Above, Kete Colquhoun from Dreweatts auction house, with the highlight of the sale, 'Duchess of Buccleuch'

The 'Duchess of Buccleuch' has a pre-sale estimate of £50,000 but is expected to go for double that amount. The maroon-coloured engine is 10ft long and took ten years to build

The Duchess was constructed by Harry Powell, who worked all his life at the Crew locomotive works and used his original drawings to make it. The fine attention to detail is such that it is fitted with a copper boiler, safety valves, regulator, blower, whistle, brake, wheel reverse gear, lever-operated sliding firedoors, pressure gauges, twin water sight gauges and a mahogany planked floor

He spent many happy years chugging 
around behind the engines that have wheel/track gauges ranging from 
two-and-a-quarter inch to 10-and-a-quarter inch.

Mr
Salem would sit on a trolley wagon that was pulled by the locos and he 
would reach over and spoon coal into the engine to fire it.

Following the recent death of his widow, Mr Salem’s children have decided to sell off his model locomotives at auction.

The
highlight of the sale is the scaled-down version of the Sir William 
Stanier London, Midland and Scottish Railways locomotive the ‘Duchess of
Buccleuch’.

Another of the working scale replicas up for sale is 'The Welch Regiment' with a £20,000 estimate. After he sold the linen mill that he owned in Lancashire, Mr Salem retired to Switzerland where he had a half-a-mile long track, complete with stations, tunnels and viaducts, built in his garden in Geneva

A seven-and-a-quarter gauge Great Western 61xx Class locomotive called 'Large Prairie' that was also made by Mr Powell is for sale too, and is expected to fetch £20,000. Another Great Western loco model made by celebrated engineer James Stanley Beeson of Ringwood, Hampshire, is tipped to sell for £15,000

The maroon-coloured engine is 10ft long and took ten years to build.

It has a pre-sale estimate of £50,000 but is expected to go for double that amount.

The real deal: A 'Large Prairie' locomotive on the West Somerset Railway GWR

A seven-and-a-quarter gauge Great 
Western 61xx Class locomotive called ‘Large Prairie’ that was also made 
by Mr Powell is for sale too.

The 5ft long engine is in classic Great Western green with black livery and expected to sell for at least £20,000.

Another Great Western loco model made by celebrated engineer James Stanley Beeson of Ringwood, Hampshire, is tipped to sell for £15,000.

Michael Matthews, of auctioneers Dreweatts of Honiton, Devon, said: 'This is the finest collection of model-engineered locomotives to have ever come on the market.

'We have worldwide interest in them from collectors all over the world; in America, Australia, Japan and Europe.

'These are real steam engines that are fired up with coal and driven, not little models of engines you see in boardrooms and bedrooms.

Mr Salem died about 20 years ago. The engines have remained at the family home in Switzerland and have been carefully transported by lorry to England for the sale

'Mr Salem’s father was a steam enthusiast before him and he carried the passion on and was in the financial position where he could commission these locomotives.

'He collected them over 40 years and moved to Switzerland to live in the 1960s. He had a beautiful garden railway built in his four-acre garden in the mountains outside of Geneva.

'Mr Salem sat on a small trolley wagon behind the engines and poured coal into the firebox to drive it. Each engine could pull up to 30 passenger carriages.

'Only four models of the Duchess of Buccleuch locomotive were made but Mr Salem’s is the Rolls-Royce of the four.

'It is an incredible feat of model engineering that took ten years and 18,000 hours for Harry Powell to build.'

Mr Salem died about 20 years ago.

The engines have remained at the family home in Switzerland and have been carefully transported by lorry to England for the sale.

The auction is being held by Dreweatts at its saleroom at Donnington Priory, Newbury, Berkshire, on Wednesday.

A Coronation class 'Duchess of Buccleuch' passes platelayers at Brinklow station, Warwickshire, circa 1952

Train engineer William
Stanier, born in 1876, was first approached by the London, Midland and 
Scottish Railway in 1931 to work on their locomotives.

The 
Stanier ‘Duchess Class’ designated 7P operated throughout Great Britain 
and were ostensibly Princess Coronation Class Locomotives which were 
nicknamed 'Duchesses'.

Many
consider the Duchess class, popular in the pre- and immediately 
post-war period,  the finest British passenger locomotives ever built.

They
hauled the heaviest express trains from Euston through to Scotland 
including ‘The Royal Scot’ and earlier ‘Coronation’ services.

One of the class was sent to America for the World Fair of 1939.

All the class were withdrawn in 1965 and three are now in preservation.

The train seen above - built as No 6230 at Crewe works in June 1938 - remained in service until November 1963 when it was withdrawn from Polmadie shed in Glasgow to be scrapped during December 1963 by Crewe works.
