Retailers affected by the Sydney siege are anxiously waiting to find out if the government declares the 16-hour hostage situation a terrorism event.

Shops in Sydney’s central business district have claimed their sales slumped by 70 per cent on December 15 - the day of the siege - as the streets around the Lindt café in Martin Place, where 18 people were being held at gunpoint by Man Haron Monis, were locked down by police.

Some insurance companies are reportedly holding back on making any decisions on payouts until Treasurer Joe Hockey has announced whether the tragic event was a terrorism event, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

Sydney's centre went into lockdown during the Martin Place siege at the Lindt cafe 

Police cordoned off areas to protect the public resulting in some shops filing insurance claims for the trade they lost out on 

If Mr Hockey declares it a terrorism event then insurers will be assisted by a federally funded group, the Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation, to help limit the amount they have to pay out possibly saving them thousands of dollars.

The siege happened in the week leading up to Christmas, a time when the Australian National Retailers predicted consumers would spend $8.3 billion. Director of the ANR, Russell Zimmerman, told the paper the siege slowed sales 'right off'.

A spokesperson for Mr Hockey told SMH: ‘We are also working closely with relevant agencies as they carry out their investigations. If required, any decision on declaring a terrorism incident would likely be made in the coming weeks.’

On Sunday, it emerged highly-trained police officers were more concerned about the contents of the Man Haron Monis' backpack than his firearm when they stormed the Lindt cafe in the chilling final seconds of the Sydney siege.

The six State Protection Group officers were ordered to enter the Martin Place building immediately after cafe manager Tori Johnson was shot in the head by the gunman, reports the Daily Telegraph.

The crucial movements of the SPG officers have been praised as 'text book entry' by those within the police force, as the specially-trained squad displayed a calm and composed nature despite their suspicions that Monis was strapped with an explosive.

'They (the SPG) knew as soon the hostage was shot … that they would be going through that door,' a senior police source told The Daily Telegraph.

'The team who went through the doors still thought there were bombs (inside). They were more worried about the backpack than the gun.'

'They were confronted by a man with what they think is a bomb strapped to him and firing a gun at them as they’re going in.' 

Instead, he claimed Monis (pictured) was only seeking attention and was motivated by his problems with the government and his limited ability to contact his children

Monis and two of his hostages, Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson, were killed in the bloody conclusion to the siege in the early hours of December 16

Once Monis was killed, the next concern for the officers was getting the remainder of the female hostages out of the building as safely as possible.

It was only then that the officers had time to think about themselves and fled the cafe as the contents of the backpack attached to the gunman's back were still unknown.

The Bomb Squad then entered the building and discovered that despite wires hanging out of Monis' backpack - it did not contain explosives.

The December siege, which shocked Australia and sparked an outpouring of grief from across the nation, ended with the deaths of cafe manager Tori Johnson and mother-of-three Katrina Dawson - who worked as a barrister at nearby law chambers Eight Selborne.
