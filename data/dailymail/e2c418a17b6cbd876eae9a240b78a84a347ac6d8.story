Siobhain McDonagh accepted 'very substantial' damages and a public apology at the High Court today

A Labour MP has demanded The Sun's editor be sacked after his fellow politician accepted 'very substantial damages'  from the paper, who accessed text messages from her stolen mobile phone.

Chris Bryant MP demanded that Dominic Mohan be sacked after the newspaper apologised to Siobhain McDonagh, whose text messages were accessed by the paper. 

He wrote on Twitter: 'Surely Dominic Mohan should be sacked,' after a judge in the High Court, London heard that in October 2010 Ms McDonagh's private mobile telephone was stolen from her car in south west London.

The MP for Rhondda furiously Tweeted after David Sherborne, representing the MP, told Mr Justice Vos how Ms McDonagh had learned of the the paper's activities.

Mr Sherborne said that in June last year police notified her that they had 'obtained evidence that The Sun newspaper had accessed her text messages from about October 2010 and therefore appeared to have accessed and/or acquired her mobile phone'.

In a separate case, former boxer Chris 
Eubank has turned down a 'derisory' £21,000 offer to settle his phone 
hacking claims against the News of the World.

The MP for Mitcham and Morden since 1997, assistant whip and private secretary to Dr John Reid whilst he was Home Secretary and Minister for Defence, was told by police in June last year that the Sun had accessed her text messages.

She was 'extremely concerned about this and wanted to know what had happened to her private and confidential information as well as her mobile telephone,' said Mr Sherborne.

She won a court order last October banning publication of her private messages and for delivery up of her phone.

Ms McDonagh said an agreement was made several weeks ago but finalised in court today.She said: 'I'm in public life and I don't have a hang-up about my own privacy, but my family and constituents who had contacted me and given personal views were subjected to people seeing it. That made me feel very uneasy.

'As an MP, people tell me all sorts of things, people give their personal information and they believe that you will do the right thing with it. That wasn't for anyone's eyes.

'I was a government whip, I had lots of phone numbers and had then exposed all those people to having their privacy invaded, and that troubled me.'

News Group admitted there was 'serious wrongdoing and misuse of her private information and her mobile telephone,' said Mr Sherborne.

Dinah Rose QC, who was speaking on behalf of the defendants, said that it was accepted that her mobile phone 'should not have been accessed and used and furthermore accept that there has been a serious misuse of her private information'.

The announcement of Ms McDonagh's settlement came during the 14th case management conference relating to civil damages actions brought by scores of people from all walks of life over the phone- hacking scandal.

New Group said there had been 'serious wrongdoing and misuse of Siobhain McDonagh's private information and her mobile telephone'

At the beginning of proceedings today,
Hugh Tomlinson QC told the court that there had been 'substantial 
developments' since the previous case management hearing.

A
number of further arrests had been made 'in what the Metropolitan 
Police Service have characterised in their public statement as a new 
conspiracy to intercept voice mail messages'.

He added that it involved 'potentially hundreds of victims'.

Mr Tomlinson, who represents claimants in the action, said it was 'not known at the moment how many more claims may be issued'.

Mr Sherborne said the defendants - the publishers and/or owners of The Sun - had agreed to pay Ms McDonagh 'very substantial damages' and her legal costs.

Dinah Rose QC, for the defendants, told the judge: 'Through me they offer their unreserved apology to the claimant for what has happened.

'Furthermore they have undertaken to 
the court not to use any information so obtained nor to access or 
attempt to access by unlawful means the claimant's private information.'

Mr
Sherborne said that 'in these circumstances the claimant has obtained 
significant protection and vindication of her privacy rights and she is 
therefore content not to pursue this matter any further'.

Former
World boxing champion Chris Eubank has turned down a 'derisory' £21,000
offer to settle his phone hacking claims against the News of the World.

The 46-year-old former middleweight and super middleweight champion told the High Court today he was looking forward to the 'gargantuan battle ahead of me ' with News International.

He said he had refused to accept the £21,000 offered in settlement: 'I am not accepting their derisory offer because they have taken everything from me.

'They have destroyed my marriage and I have not been able to care for my children for eight years. That is why I am fighting News International.'

Dinah Rose QC asked the judge to strike out all references to the £21,000 and his 'unsubstantiated and scandalous claims.'

But the figure had already been tweeted from the court and the judge told her he had tried to stop Mr Eubank speaking 'gratuitously' but added 'what is done is done.'     

The former boxer alleged the newspaper had 'made a mockery of the justice system' by deleting information relating to him.

He accused them of 'hiding behind a veneer of corporate respectability' and said a clear and unflinching message should be made that justice and the laws of Great Britain should not be destroyed by 'lies and deceit.'

The judge made clear to him that his case was only at a preliminary stage and the court was not the place for him to make a speech.

Hugh Tomlinson QC for the claimants against the News of the World said 145 of the original 167 claims had been settled of the 23 remaining, including that of Chris Eubank , with two more applying to be joined.

News Group had called for an April 1st cut off of any more compensation claims, and had agreed to pay a 'substantial sum' towards the legal costs of the case so far already estimated in excess of £5m.

This is the latest in a series of settlements with the Duchess of York accepting undisclosed damages last month, along with actors Hugh Grant and Christopher Ecclestone , singer James Blunt and actress and singer Kerry Katona.

Some of the biggest payouts include singer Charlotte Church and her parents who received £600,000 between them and the parents of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler said to have received £3m.

Other hacking settlements include £130,000 to film star Jude Law, £68,000 to former England star Paul Gascoigne, £40,000 to comedian Steve Coogan, Liberal Democrat deputy leader Simon Hughes received £45,000, former MP George Galloway was handed £25,000, Tony Blair's former communication's director Alistair Campbell, accepted undisclosed 'substantial' damages, and sports agent Sky Andrew received £75,000.

Publishers News Group Newspapers are said to have put aside at least £20m to pay the claims.
