Matt Seddon, died after his car hit a central reservation and somersaulted down a dual carriageway while being chased by police

A teenager has died after his car hit a central reservation and somersaulted down a dual carriageway while being chased by police.

The 19-year-old, named locally as Matt Seddon, was thrown from the vehicle as it rolled along a road in Reading, Berkshire, at around 11.30pm yesterday.

He was being chased by police after he failed to stop when he was ordered to pull over.

He lost control of the red Fiesta on the A33 Rose Kiln Lane, driving across two lanes before rolling the vehicle which eventually landed upright on his wheels.

Mr Seddon, a former pupil at Denefield School, Reading, was thrown from the car and tributes have been left at the scene of the tragedy.Â 

A card on one of the bunches of flowers said: 'He was great, great lad.'

Others took to Facebook to express their condolences. Danielle Rose, said that she recognised the wrecked car as the Fiesta she had recently sold to Matthew.

'That's my mate and my car,' she wrote. 'RIP Matt Seddon. xx'

Sophie Edwards wrote: 'R.I.P. Matt, Loved By So Many People. Can't Believe It :'( Sleep Tight Hun'

And Evie Newman said: 'R.I.P Matt Seddon, sad to say goodbye to someone so young. Sleep tight x'

The incident has been referred to the
Independent Police Complaints Commission into the conduct of the 
officers from the Thames Valley Police traffic unit.

The badly-damaged car lay at the side of 
the road for more than 12 hours after the collision as accident 
investigators carried out a detailed examination of the scene.

failing to stop when the car collided with the central reservation on

The pursuit reportedly began when the red Fiesta failed to pull over after being signalled by a patrol car

'The driver, who was the sole occupant of the Ford Fiesta, was pronounced dead at the scene.

'IPCC investigators were deployed to the scene following a referral from Thames Valley Police and independent investigation has started.

'We are also investigating how many police vehicles were involved in the incident'.

'We have referred the incident to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.'

A post mortem examination was due to be carried out on the man and a formal identification was due to take place before an inquest was opened and adjourned.
