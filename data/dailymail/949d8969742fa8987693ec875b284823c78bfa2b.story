Manny Pacquiao and Amir Khan came across each other again in a tumbledown corner of south east London and began informal man-to-man discussions about an alternative superbout in case Floyd Mayweather fails to call either of them for his next megafight.

Khan and Pacquiao are friends and sparring partners and they met up at the century-old Fitzroy Lodge Boxing Club which is squeezed in a tunnel of bricks and aluminium that forms part of a railway-line archway in Lambeth.

They did stand in the old ring which has produced some of Britain’s finest prizefighters but declined the suggestion of swapping a few punches.

The visit of ring royalty to this dusty but hallowed corner of boxing came at the end of Pacquiao’s visit to London which included Thursday night’s dinner with boxing fan Prince Harry at Buckingham Palace.

Khan prefaced the reunion by visiting Wembley stadium which has been mooted as a venue if he ever agrees to a battle of Britain with Kell Brook.

But this engagement has an eye to him meeting Pacquiao here.

If that is to happen, Mayweather would have to pass on the two leading contenders to face him in Las Vegas on May 2.

Khan is aware that Mayweather versus Pacquiao is the $300million spectacular which most of the world wants to see and that global audience would have been excited to hear Pacquiao telling me: ‘I think now that Floyd and me is going to happen. It looks like it.’

This is the closest either Mayweather or Pacquiao have come to predicting a real likelihood of the barriers blocking the way of the richest fight of all time are as good as removed.

Even so, the PacMan is putting Plan B in place with Khan.

As Pacquiao continued his state visit to London his advisor Michael Koncz told me: ‘Just in case Floyd doesn't come through we regard Amir as the best possible alternative. He and Manny would make for a very exciting fight and Manny would be more than happy to do it at Wembley stadium.

‘We are looking at that possibility and also Abu Dhabi as another potential venue.

‘But of course we are still working on Mayweather.’

Khan said: ‘I’ve been looking at Wembley which would be a great stage for me and Manny and Abu Dhabi is very much in the running.

‘It was great seeing Manny again. We talked a bit about old times and also about the future. Although we have this friendship, if fighting each other makes sense then it can certainly happen.’

Khan set a mid-January deadline for Mayweather to deliver on his long-standing promise of giving the young man from Bolton the biggest fight of his life.

That has passed but with Mayweather still deliberating khan would obviously respond eagerly if the offer was still to come.

Mayweather has a third option in one of his former victims, Miguel Cotto, who would bring plenty of Hispanic interest to a Las Vegas on the weekend of a major Mexican state holiday.

Pacquiao set his own Mayweather deadline as January 31 but he was more confident then at any other time so far that it will be met as he arrived at Fitzroy Lodge.

He was greeted by dozens of cheering young London boxers and their trainers as he came through that creaking old door.

There was also a rousing rendition of the Lambeth walk as Khan arrived a few minutes later.

Pacquiao said: ‘The dinner with Prince Harry was very enjoyable and I am really pleased to come to a boxing place like this.'

He also confirmed a fight with Khan could take place. 

'Yes, there's a big possibility, nothing personal, we're just doing our job in the ring,' he said on Sky Sports News HQ.

'It's not difficult for us because we respect each other and we're just doing our job in the ring.'

As for his hopes on fighting Mayweather, Pacquiao maintained he has done everything in his power to make the bout happen and it is now in the American's hands.

'We're waiting for the answer from them, the signed contract from them, probably next week we will know if the fight (can be) pushed through or not,' he added.

Khan was greeted just as enthusiastically and then said to Pacquaio: ‘Great. Now lets talk.’
