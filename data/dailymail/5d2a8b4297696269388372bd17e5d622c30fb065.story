Sanchez has been a huge hit since moving to north London in the summer, scoring 14 goals in his 24 appearances.

Arsene Wenger spoke on Friday of his delight at having captured the former Barcelona man, especially considering the competition they faced for his signature.

He said: 'I just tried, like ever manager, to convince the player that you can help him to develop the quality of his game, that the way we play football would suit him and that's why I think he has chosen us in the end. 

'I think at the end of the day every great player has a choice to make. He chose us and we're very happy for that. I don't know why he has chosen us over anyone else but we're very happy that he has done that.'
