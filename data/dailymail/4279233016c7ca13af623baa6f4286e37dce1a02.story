England bowling coach David Saker heaped praise on his bowlers as they closed in on victory over India at the Ageas Bowl - a result that would see Alastair Cook's side win a Test for the first time in 11 months.

James Anderson quickly claimed the final two wickets of India's first innings during the morning session before England rapidly scored 205 for four to leave the tourists needing a world record 445 runs to win the third Test.

Cook and England have failed to win in their last 11 Tests but brilliant spin bowling from Moeen Ali and Joe Root reduced the Indians to a perilous 112 for four at stumps.

On the brink: England are closing in on victory against India at the Ageas Bowl thanks to their bowlers

Proud: England bowling coach David Saker was full of praise for his bowling unit on day four

The tourists need 333 to win - having already lost their top four batsman - or they must survive a full fifth day with just six wickets left to scrape a draw.

Saker told Sky Sports 2: 'The impressive thing has been their attitude. They’ve got stuck in and just gone and done their work and the results have come with that and that’s testament to this group.

'We’ve got a young group, pretty much other than Jimmy (Anderson) and Stuart (Broad), who have been really good in the way they have led us in theis Test.'

With a particular mention for Anderson, who finished the day with figures of none for 13 from eight second-innings overs to go with his first-innings haul of five for 53, Saker added: 'He’s gone back to that magnificent control.

'We know he’s got the skill but if he backs that up with the control and putting the ball in difficult position for the batters, he always gets those rewards.

'We had a big chat about making sure we put the ball in a position where it is tough for the batsman, and we then use our skills to maybe move the ball and that’s pretty much what’s happened so far this game.'

And Saker is confident that his men can get the job done on Thursday and finish off the tourists to level the series 1-1. 

He said: '(It’s about) running in and delivering the ball hard at a length, hitting the stumps as many times as you can and looking for the pads and the outside edge.

'It was pleasing today because we did have a couple of half appeals with inside edges hitting the pads and we got past the outside edge a bit.

'It’s still going to be tough work for the seamers, there’s no doubt about it.'
