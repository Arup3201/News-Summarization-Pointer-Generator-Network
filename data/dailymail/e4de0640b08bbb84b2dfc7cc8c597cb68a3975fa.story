When Elan Spreiser proposed to his girlfriend, nothing went to plan - but thanks to some priceless 
photos, the special moment turned out perfectly.

The 23-year-old intended to ask for Koren Lockwood's hand on the observation deck of New York's Rockefeller Center earlier this month.

But when rain foiled both that plan and his back up - popping the question on a horse-and-buggy ride - the Rhode Island man dropped to one knee and proposed on the sidewalk near Central Park.

What the loved-up couple didn't realize was that a kindhearted passerby, moved by the 'quintessential New York moment', captured the romantic moment.

Simple and spontaneous: A passerby snapped the lovely moment Elan Spreiser, 23, dropped to one knee and proposed to Koren Lockwood, 25, on a busy New York City street earlier this month

Romantic: Koren Lockwood was over the moon when her beau, Elan Spreiser, popped the question near Central Park in New York City earlier this month, not realizing his two previous proposal plans had not worked out

Jeannae Zuloaga, 23, had been standing nearby, unable to find her way, when she saw the spontaneous proposal unfold before her.

'I immediately was like, ‘They need pictures of this moment, they’re going to want pictures,' Zuloaga told TODAY.com.

She
 snapped two photos: one of Spreiser on bended knee in the rain, and the
 other of the two kissing under a red umbrella when Lockwood said yes.

'That was the quintessential New York
 moment that I needed to make me feel like I was in the right place at 
the right time,' Zuloaga said.

'To have it happen just after moving to New 
York was really special. It was a wonderful moment, and I couldn’t be 
happier for them.'

When she approached the newly engaged couple to show them her picture, Spreiser hugged her and told her, 'You’re my favorite person right now, besides [my fiance].'

The 
engaged couple still marvel at the beauty of that moment, which 25-year-old
Lockwood called 'half random act of kindness and half random act of God.'

The two are still in touch with Zuloaga, who they plan to invite to their wedding next year.

They also told HuffPost Weddings they will use the photos for their save-the-date invitations.

As for the proposal, Spreiser said he was thrilled with how it turned out: 'For something that went so 
not according to plan, it couldn’t have gone any better.'
