It's already been a huge sporting year, with the World Cup, Winter Olympics and Glasgow's Commonwealth Games delighting millions of  fans around the world.

But there's one more genuine spectacular still to come, this week's Ryder Cup at Gleneagles, with old rivals Europe and the United States set to do battle once again.

Sportsmail's nostalgic picture series Golden Years this week focuses on the Ryder Cup, taking you on a journey that spans the best part of a century, from the first contest in 1927 through to Europe's memorable win on American soil in 2012.

Along the way we show you some charming pictures from those early contests, along with some of the iconic moments like Bernhard Langer's missed putt. And many of the sport's all-time greats are here too, like Jack Nicklaus, Seve Ballesteros, Tom Watson and Nick Faldo.

If you wish to share your memories, please leave a comment beneath this article, and we'll be back on a football theme next Wednesday, with  more pictures from archives.

Here's a picture of the Great Britain team about to catch the train at the beginning of a long journey to Worcester Country Club, Massachusetts, for the first Ryder Cup in 1927. From left to right: George Duncan, Archie Compston, captain Ted Ray, Fred Robson, Sam Ryder (with dog), the English businessman that is credited with the founding of the event, George Gadd, Charles Whitcombe, Arthur Havers, Abe Mitchell, and team manager George Philpot. The USA were the winners of that first contest

Above, a picture of American great Gene Sarazen in action during the second Ryder Cup at the Moortown Golf Club in Leeds. Sarazen is one of only five golfers in the sport's history to have won all four of the current majors.  Hosts Great Britain were 7-5 winners of that second contest. Below, Britain's Abe Mitchell, in action during the 1929 event, shows that golf clothing has changed somewhat over the last century

Samuel Ryder (left) presents the Ryder Cup trophy to winning captain, Great Britain's George Duncan, after victory over the USA in 1929. Ryder donated the trophy, which was valued at 100 guineas. Scot Duncan, who played in the first three Ryder Cups, won the Open Championship in 1920. Below, Britain's Dai Rees putts on the 18th green at the Southport and Ainsdale Golf Club during the 1937 Ryder Cup. The Americans won 8-4, the first time the hosts had lost in the event

The scoreboard is being changed during the 1933 Ryder Cup at the Southport and Ainsdale Golf Club. Just a two-day event back then, victory once more went to the hosts, with Great Britain claiming a win by the narrow margin of six-and-a-half points to five-and-a-half

Above, American Fred Haas plays out of a bunker during his singles clash with Harry Bradshaw at the 1953 version at Wentworth. Henry Cotton's home team lost out to the Americans in a close contest, the winners victorious by six-and-a-half to five-and-a-half. Below, Great Britain captain Dai Rees holds aloft the Ryder Cup after a seven-and-a-half to four-and-a-half win at Rotherham's Lindrick Golf Club in 1957. However, there then came a period of dominance by the Americans

You may recognise the man in the above picture - it's the voice of golf for generations, Peter Alliss, teeing off on the first hole at Birkdale during the 1965 Ryder Cup. This match was typical of many at the time, with the Americans making it a virtual non-contest with an 18-11 win

Jack Nicklaus, still widely seen as the greatest golfer of all time, plays a shot on the third hole at Royal Birkdale during the 1969 Ryder Cup. Right, Nicklaus shakes hands with Tony Jacklin after famously and sportingly conceding a putt, to ensure the 1969 contest finished in a 16-16 draw. It was the first drawn contest in Ryder Cup history

Above, a picture of Englishman Peter Butler celebrating after making the first hole in one in Ryder Cup history at Muirfield in 1973. Below, one of British golf's all-time heroes, Nick Faldo, celebrating his singles win over Tom Watson at the 1977 Ryder Cup at Royal Lytham & St Annes. This was Faldo's first Ryder Cup, and he carried on playing in the contest until 1997, with 11 appearances in all. He also captained Europe at the 2008 Ryder Cup

 

Left, Tom Watson and Jack Nicklaus pictured during the 1981 Ryder Cup at Walton Heath. Great Britain and Ireland were replaced by Europe for the 1979 contest, but there was no immediate effect. The Americans won in 1981 by 18-and-a-half to nine-and-a-half points. The long wait for an American defeat was ended in 1985 at The Belfry. Right, a celebrating Sam Torrance holds his arms aloft after sinking a putt to claim a singles win over Andy North and clinch victory for Europe

The 1985 Ryder Cup proved to be a glorious one for the Europeans, with Tony Jacklin captaining the hosts to victory at The Belfry. The Americans were beaten in the contest for the first time since 1957. Here, Jacklin celebrates with members of the team - the man spraying the champagne is all-time great and Ryder Cup hero Seve Ballesteros. In the background is Sam Torrance and Bernhard Langer

The enduring image of the 1987 contest is surely this, Spaniard Jose Maria Olazabal dancing. His partnership with compatriot Seve Ballesteros proved to be an inspirational one, with the Americans beaten on home soil for the first time. It was Ballesteros that fittingly sank the putt that clinched victory, with Europe 15-13 winners

Christy O'Connor Jnr became a Ryder Cup hero in 1989, making a dramatic birdie on the 18th to beat Fred Couples and claim a crucial point for his European team. Here, the Irishman triumphantly walks on to the 18th green at The Belfry. The overall score was 14-14 in that 1989 contest, the second time in the history of the event that the final score was a draw. It was enough for Europe to retain the Ryder Cup, the final one of four in which Tony Jacklin was their captain

This must surely rank as the single most dramatic moment in Ryder Cup history, with Bernhard Langer missing a six-foot putt in 1991 that would have clinched a singles win over Hale Irwin, a 14-14 draw and retention of the trophy for Europe. Agonisingly for Bernard Gallacher's team, the ball slipped past the hole and the hosts could celebrate victory at Kiawah Island. It was an event that was at times so bitter, it was given the name 'War on the Shore'

Three European giants pictured next - on the left, Colin Montgomerie and Nick Faldo during the 1995 contest at Oak Hill. The Europeans came from 9-7 behind on the final day to claim a famous win by 14-and-a-half points to 13-and-a-half. On the right, one of Europe's most inspirational figures of all time, Seve Ballesteros, pictured with the trophy after captaining Europe to victory at Valderrama in 1997. Ballesteros also played in eight Ryder Cup contests

The Americans surged back from behind at Brookline in 1999 to claim a famous victory. Europe were 10-6 ahead after two days, but the Americans dominated the early stages of the singles on the Sunday and the momentum inexorably swung their way. The contest ended in ugly fashion when American players, pictured here, invaded the green in delight when Justin Leonard holed a monster putt on the 17th, even though Jose Maria Olazabal still had a putt that could have kept Europe alive

Of all the memorable celebrations at Ryder Cups, few have matched Paul McGinley being thrown into the lake at The Belfry after holing the winning putt in 2002. McGinley played in three European teams, and all of them were victorious, in 2002, 2004 and 2006. The Irishman will captain Europe in this week's contest at Gleneagles

The 2006 Ryder Cup at the K Club in Ireland was most memorable for the contribution made by Darren Clarke, pictured above, just weeks after the death of his wife, Heather. Clarke, a popular figure with golf fans, was given a rapturous reception throughout the event, but particularly on the final day when he claimed a singles win over Zach Johnson. Europe were comfortable winners by 18-and-a-half points to nine-and-a-half, and in the below picture home captain Ian Woosnam has just celebrated by drinking a pint of Guinness. Pictured alongside him are Sam Torrance, Clarke and Lee Westwood

The last two Ryder Cups have been thrilling affairs. Above, Graeme McDowell celebrates after making a crucial birdie on the 16th in his decisive singles clash with Hunter Mahan at Celtic Manor. McDowell's 3&1 victory gave Europe the point they needed to beat the Americans by 14-and-a-half points to 13-and-a-half. The same margin of victory was enjoyed by Europe two years ago in an even more dramatic contest on American soil. Jose Maria Olazabal's team were 10-4 down at one stage, but fought back for an incredible win. Below, Rory McIlroy celebrates Martin Kaymer's clinching putt, with the European victory christened the 'Miracle of Medinah'
