United Colors of Benetton has hand-picked Joan Smalls to be the face of its colourful SS15 campaign

Describing its muse, the brand said: 'Joan is a highly talented and successful woman who reflects the perfect Benetton way of life - Italian style that mixes fashion and practicality.'

The upcoming collection aims to celebrate Italian style and the brand's designers have curated flirty separates  to pay tribute to the Italian zest for dressing well, say Benetton bosses say.

Joan stars in the first of four campaigns to showcase the Italian brand's flirty new designs 

The campaign was shot in New York by American photographer Cass Bird, who has recently worked for The New York Times Magazine, Rolling Stone, GQ and Paper Magazine.

Between February and May, Joan will feature in four different campaigns for the brand to show off the new collection in all its glory.  

Joan's highly successful fashion career began in 2007. Since then, she has walked the runway for the most celebrated designers and fashion houses, featured on the most prestigious covers and appeared in  popular music videos, including Beyonce's Yonce video.

In 2014, Joan topped models.com’s ranking of the 50 most sought-after models, and appeared on the Return of the Supermodel cover of American Elle.

She also made history when she became the first Latina model to represent Estée Lauder cosmetics, interviewing newcomer Kendall Jenner when she joined. 

She is also part of the new age of hot, young models and is regularly seen hanging out with Karlie Kloss, Cara Delevingne and Georgia May Jagger.
