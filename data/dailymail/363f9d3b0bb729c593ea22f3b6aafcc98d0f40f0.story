Lucky escape: Victor Bywater was able to escape a fire at his Greater Manchester home when he was woken up by his pet cat

As fire began to engulf his house, businessman Victor Bywater slept soundly.

He woke only when his cat Crystal leapt on his bed, bouncing and miaowing frantically.

Alerted to the danger, Mr Bywater, 50, fled through the flames and smoke to safety. But tragically, the black and white moggy who saved his life perished in the blaze.

His other cat, Fudge, escaped the inferno but has not been seen since.

Last night Mr Bywater, who is said to be devastated by Crystal’s death, remained in hospital in a serious condition with burns to his head and damage to his lungs from smoke inhalation.

The medical supplies company boss did not have a smoke alarm fitted inside his detached £250,000 house in Timperley, near Altrincham, Cheshire.

Mr Bywater, who is divorced with three grown-up children, was asleep at 5.30am on Monday when Crystal entered the room and jumped on his bed.

He fled the flames wearing only his dressing gown and woke neighbours to raise the alarm.

A neighbour said: ‘He came banging on the door and I couldn’t believe the flames.

‘He said something about his cat waking him up when he was in bed and I’d say he got out in the nick of time.

‘The fire obviously started downstairs and made its way up. His Mercedes and Nissan cars were parked in his drive so I was terrified they’d explode and the fire would spread to our house.

‘Once we were out, he went banging on the other neighbour’s door to wake them. Vic doted on his cats and will be devastated at losing them.’

Fire crews praised the actions of Crystal for saving her master’s life. Altrincham station manager Kevin Brogden said Mr Bywater was ‘incredibly lucky to make it out’ alive.

Investigators said the blaze is thought to have been caused by an electrical fault in the living room. The damage to the property is so extensive that it may have to be demolished.

Station commander Peter Lamb said: 'Mr Bywater had been woken by his cat who was bouncing on his bed.

'He has come downstairs and has been confronted by a lot of smoke and heat. He managed to escape through the front door and call us out.

'He's fortunately been saved by his cat but his cat hasn't made it. He's got two, one found dead in the house and the other is unaccounted for at the moment.'

The £250,000 property was badly damaged in the fire, which broke out at around 5.30am, and may now have to be demolished.

The neighbour added: 'The problem is, he didn't have any of his doors shut, so it was like the fire was spreading through a wind tunnel. I've known him for a long time, it would be very sad if he couldn't move back in.

He added: 'Vic doted on his cats and will be devastated at losing them.'

Another neighbour Deborah Wheeler, 54, a teaching assistant, said: 'I looked out and saw the fire engines.

'I couldn't see the smoke and at first I thought they were looking for a gas escape. I looked out through the window and I could see flames coming through the roof.'
