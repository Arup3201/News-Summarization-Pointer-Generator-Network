A British woman has been sentenced to three months in a Dubai jail followed by deportation for having drunken sex in the back of a taxi in the city.

Rebecca Blake, 29, had been arrested earlier this year after partially stripping off in the back of the cab after a 10-hour drinking binge.

Irishman Conor McRedmond, 28, with whom she was caught,  was also convicted and received the same sentence, despite DNA tests to find evidence of intercourse coming back negative.

The pair have been released on bail 
pending an appeal hearing in January but will have to spend Christmas in
Dubai because their passports have been taken away.

Recruitment consultant Blake, from Dorking in Surrey, was arrested on May 4 after first meeting McRedmond just hours earlier.

Their taxi driver alerted police after
spotting Blake in his rearview mirror with her top off, straddling 
McRedmond and ‘making the sounds of a woman having sex’.

Blake, who moved to Dubai in September
last year to take up a £100,000-a-year-post at Manpower recruitment 
firm, had been at a drink-all-you-like £35-a-head brunch in the Rotana 
Hotel. She previously said: ‘They just kept filling up my glass. It’s 
all a blur.’

At 4pm, she moved on to the hotel bar 
and indulged in a happy hour until 6pm before continuing drinking at the
Irish Village pub with McRedmond. Blake, who admitted having four vodka
drinks and five glasses of wine, then caught a taxi at 10.30pm with 
McRedmond, from County Offaly, who had had ‘six or seven’ vodka drinks.

Pakistani taxi driver Qaiser Khan, 29,
told the court in a statement the couple seemed confused and McRedmond 
swigged from a bottle.

He said: ‘I told him it was not allowed to have alcohol inside the taxi.

‘The next thing, I looked in the 
mirror and saw the woman sitting on the man’s thighs. She was naked, 
moving up and down and making sounds.’

Mr Khan said he pulled over, spotted a
police patrol and called over Emirati officer Abdullah Obaid Khamis, 
22, who said he found the pair still having sex.

Mr Khamis said: ‘The man’s shirt was open, his trousers were down to his knees and the woman was not wearing any underwear.’

Pakistani taxi driver Qaiser Khan, 29, said he picked the couple up at around 11pm after their all-day drinking binge, which had started with midday brunch and unlimited drinks

Ms Blake, who moved to Dubai in September last year and worked for Manpower recruitment firm until she was sacked after the incident in May, has said: 'I'm no saint. The whole incident was a blur'

The taxi driver claimed Blake offered 
him ‘a lot of money’ to tell prosecutors the pair were kissing rather 
than having sex but he refused.

The couple’s defence lawyer said there
were gaping inconsistencies in the witness accounts. He also said the 
pair could not have been having sex because Blake was on her period at 
the time, adding: ‘This is Dubai, not a mosque. Everyone drinks.’

Neither witness gave evidence in the trial. Their statements were instead submitted to judges in the misdemeanours court.

Blake and McRedmond denied having 
consensual sex and indecency. They previously pleaded guilty to 
consuming alcohol and were fined £512.

Both said they could not comment.

They are the latest expats to fall 
foul of the United Arab Emirates’ strict laws preventing drunkenness in 
public and sex outside marriage.

In 2008, Vince Acors, 38, and Michelle
Palmer, 40, were jailed for three months for having sex on a beach. The
sentence was suspended on appeal.

And in 2009 Charlotte Adams and Ayman 
Najafi spent a month in jail after an Emirati woman complained they were
kissing in public.

Strict Islamic state: Those convicted of having sex outside marriage face a sentence of between one month and three years under Dubai law.
