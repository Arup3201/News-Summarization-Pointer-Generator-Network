Full details of how Lib Dem ministers spent almost £40,000 of taxpayers’ money flying around the world on a drugs fact-finding ‘Magical Mystery Tour’ can be revealed today.

The report was published this week to criticism after it concluded that the UK’s tough laws do not work and that legalising deadly narcotics would not lead to more use.

Details of the project – uncovered by the Daily Mail using Freedom of Information laws – show a Lib Dem minister and a team of officials spent thousands on business class fares and stays in luxury hotels

They also bought wine and chocolate from the hotel mini-bar while dining and drinking, leaving tips on Government credit cards.

Officially, the project was titled ‘Drugs: International Comparators Study’, but in the Home Office it became witheringly known as the ‘Magical Mystery Tour’.

Last year, the then drugs minister Jeremy Browne flew to Portugal, Sweden, Denmark, Japan, South Korea and the US and Canada.

After he was sacked in a reshuffle, his successor Norman Baker finished the project with visits to Switzerland and the Czech Republic.

Details of the spending – opposed by the Tories – prompted critics to question why the information could not have been gathered by the phone or using the internet.

Mr Browne was accompanied to Portugal by two Lib Dem spin doctors, and in every other country by at least two Home Office officials, significantly increasing the cost.

They stayed at the Dom Pedro Palace Hotel in Lisbon, which offers ‘elegant guest accommodations’.

He told Parliament he had decided not to go to New Zealand because he was ‘mindful of the cost’.

After he was installed as Crime Prevention Minister, Mr Baker used video conferencing this year to gather information on Uruguay, Colorado and New Zealand.

The Lib Dems declined to comment, saying only the report was Home Office-commissioned.

A Home Office spokesman insisted: ‘We look at drugs policies in other countries.’

Jonathan Isaby, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘At a time when the Government is telling us to tighten our belts we have to ensure that every trip abroad is worth it.’
