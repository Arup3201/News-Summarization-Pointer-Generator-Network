Although he is only 5ft 3in and his younger, blonde second wife towers over him, Brendan O’Carroll is an imposing man with a slightly menacing energy. 

At the National Television Awards this week, the 58-year-old creator and star of Mrs Brown’s Boys, was in full - faintly terrifying - flow.

Holding court backstage after winning the title of best comedy, he was happy to discuss the success of his show about a foul-mouthed Irish matriarch which the critics hated when first broadcast — but couldn’t kill off.

‘I really do respect critics,’ he said. ‘I know they’ve got a job to do. But there’ll always be a donkey telling the racehorse how he’s doing in the race.’

Then, in typical Mrs Brown language, he added: ‘You can criticise me all you like, but as long as you’re writing little columns in Mickey Mouse giveaway newspapers, f*** off.’

With withering sarcasm he said he was just grateful that the critics at least always spelled the name of the show correctly.

The reason for his ire? One snooty broadsheet called the show, which features a cursing O’Carroll in a wig and baggy cardigan as the eponymous character, ‘the worst comedy ever made’.

O’Carroll, who has made £16 million — and counting — from it, isn’t about to take such an insult lying down.

This week, wearing a black bow tie and with his spectacles perched on his balding head, he became increasingly pugnacious as he attempted to explain the secrets of  his success. His wife Jenny — who plays his daughter on screen — grimaced expressively at his side in her grey sequined dress.

Beating Miranda, American sitcom The Big Bang Theory and Derek, featuring Ricky Gervais, to the best comedy prize was another honour for the show which has been decried as hopelessly vulgar and dated. 

But the Christmas Day special pulled in the biggest audience on BBC1 — nine million viewers — and it’s no surprise that it scooped its accolade this week as the awards are based on the public vote.

The success of the show is phenomenal. It has also won a Bafta, versions have been made in Iceland, Romania and the Czech Republic and it’s the most popular comedy show in Australia.

O’Carroll is about to take the show on a three-month tour Down Under, and revenues have been estimated at £8.5 million in that country alone.

There are discussions about making a Mrs Brown in America, too, although the bad language is apparently an issue. (The show’s producer admits to 34 uses of a barely sanitised variant of the F-word in a 30-minute show.)

O’Carroll wants to write a fourth series this year, and a movie spin-off is due for release in the summer. Enormous amounts of DVDs of the show have also been sold — figures for 2012 suggest 2.1 million. 

And there are the incredibly lucrative tours. The team are in the middle of the second one. As O’Carroll exclaimed in wonder on Wednesday night: ‘325,000 of them bought tickets. I’m getting a yacht!’

So just who is Brendan O’Carroll? Born in Dublin, he was the youngest of 11 children. His father Gerald was a carpenter, who built ‘beds on the walls, like in submarines’ for his huge brood.His mother, the obvious inspiration for Mrs Brown, was an extraordinary woman who started out as a nun and ended up as a politician.

X-rated: Mrs Brown's Boys is well-known for its slightly salty brand of comedy

Unlike Mrs Brown, she was highly educated. Maureen McHugh attended University College, Galway, and became a novice nun before she renounced her vows, married and became a language teacher.

Upon her marriage in 1936 she was expected to give up her job because married women in Ireland were not allowed to be civil servants. So she embarked on protests that got the law changed.

She was the first female Irish Labour Party MP, and went on to be the party’s chief whip. O’Carroll said: ‘Ireland at the time was in the Middle Ages and it was actually legal for a husband to beat his wife with a stick, so long as the stick wasn’t longer than his forearm. My mother helped change all that.’

She had nine children and also adopted a boy from reform school. Aged 42, she became ill with ‘a growth’, which turned out to be a 9lbs 3oz boy she called Brendan.

Maureen was an outspoken woman who had no time for convention. Neither did her son. Despite an IQ reputed to be a dizzy 156, he left school aged 12 in 1968 while his mother was away on union business in Canada.

Brendan worked as a waiter on and off for the next decade. He met and fell in love with the Dubliner Doreen Dowdall when they were both 13. They were married in 1977. 

Their first son, Brendan, died a few days after being born. They went on to have three more children — Fiona, Danny and Eric.

And the family needed welfare to survive as Brendan drifted from one job to another — milkman, painter and decorator and then, publican.

Disaster struck when his partner in a Dublin pub disappeared with the money. Returning from a holiday in 1989, O’Carroll found that Kevin Moore had cleared out the pub.

In the book The Real Mrs Brown, by author Brian Beacom, O’Carroll says that he was even arrested on suspicion of killing Moore, when he was found hanged. But Kevin, who was gay, had contracted Aids and had gone to Australia for a holiday before returning to his mother’s house to hang himself.

Left with debts of £96,000, O’Carroll was declared bankrupt. He said later: ‘I was finished. At that stage, if you’d put my name into the computer, you’d have sworn that I’d murdered the bank manager’s wife, the credit rating was so bad.’

Desperate for money, O’Carroll started to work in pubs and clubs as a stand-up comedian. In 1992 he wrote a radio sitcom called Mrs Brown’s Boys which was broadcast daily on the Irish station 2FM.

Then, an appearance on the Dublin chat-show The Late Late Show the following year raised his profile. 

The host of that show, Gay Byrne, says: ‘He had the audience crying with laughter. He’s also a very sharp businessman. The fact he has got the BBC to allow him to retain complete ownership over Mrs Brown’s Boys shows what a smart operator he is.’

O’Carroll followed up his success as a stand-up by writing a novel, The Mammy, about working class matriarch Mrs Brown, and followed it with three sequels. But in 1998, when he wrote a film, Sparrow’s Trap, and directed it, funding was withdrawn, and he was left with a debt of £2 million.

He was bankrupt again. A Hollywood film of The Mammy, starring Angelica Huston, helped to nudge him towards solvency in 1999 but it was only when he wrote a play about Mrs Brown that he managed to get back into the black.

By this time he had split from Doreen and fallen for Jenny Gibney,  who was in a play with him. They married in 2005.

Brendan told his biographer his first wife was suspicious of showbusiness and preferred to take her mother to bingo than go to his first nights.

One unusual feature is that Mrs Brown's Boys leaves in footage of the cast making mistakes and then laughing

Around this time he started to play Mrs Brown, when an actress hired to play the part called in sick.O’Carroll sat down at a dressing-room mirror, put on a wig, pencilled in a mole on his chin — then declared, ‘F*** me, it’s me mammy!’ 

The show remains a family affair, with his son, daughters-in-law and former agent all taking parts in it.

One of its unusual features is that Mrs Brown’s Boys leaves in footage of the cast making mistakes and then laughing. In the first broadcast episode, O’Carroll turns to the studio audience and announces: ‘It’s just a man in a f****** dress.’

 Vulgar and old fashioned? Certainly. Obvious? Probably. But so successful that O’Carroll lives in some style in Florida, where he writes Mrs Brown’s Boys. 

His most recently filed accounts show touring profits for 2011-2012 at £880,000 — and that’s after O’Carroll took a dividend of £345,000. (They also show considerable charitable donations — he supports a Christian charity that tackles poverty and an autism charity.)

His ventures are expected to eventually net him £50 million. 

Though he often sports a moustache offscreen, he is stopped in the street and asked for photographs. O’Carroll sighs: ‘I don’t even think my mother if she was alive would want a f****** photograph of me.’ 

And the secret of his success? 

Sometimes he credits the long years of working with Mrs Brown on radio and stage with allowing him to know which jokes work. But at other times he just shrugs. 

He told his biographer: ‘Brian, do me a favour. Analyse this and tell me what the secret is, ‘cos I don’t have a f****** clue.’
