An England superfan has left neighbours in no doubt of his favourite World Cup team after decking out every inch of his house with St George's crosses.

Tony Baddams spent three weeks covering his four-bedroom terraced home in Southampton, Hampshire, with more than 300 flags, shirts and giant fluffy dice.

There are so many of the red and white flags that they have covered up his windows, blocking out the sun - but the Chelsea supporter insists it is worth it.

Spot the England fan: World Cup enthusiast Tony Baddams, 46, has decked out his terraced home in Southampton with more than 300 St George's cross flags, shirts and fluffy dice - even blocking out sunlight

Boisterous: The statement by Mr Baddams (right with his son Sean) has had a mixed reaction from neighbours

The football fan, 46, said he had been decorating his house for every World Cup since the 1980s and this year's was his best effort yet.

He has not revealed how much he has spent on the stunt - but admitted he has to buy new flags for every World Cup because the summer sunshine makes them fade.

'I just wanted to show my support for the lads,' he said. 'I love it when people call me a true England fan, I am proud of being English and supporting all the time.

'It is a family effort and we use a big ladder for the roof and a step ladder for the flags over the windows.

'It has been a bit difficult with the wind and rain recently. You start to get blown off the ladder but it was all right because my wife was holding it at the bottom.

'I do not see a lot of flags going up these days and this year it has been my best and hardest effort because of all of the wind and rain.'

His wife Anita, a carer, said she was not keen initially but has grown to love the over-the-top show of support.

The 44-year-old said: 'At first I said to Tony, "just put a couple up".

'Tony being Tony said "it's only once every four years - let's go the whole hog".

'Now I've seen it finished, I really like it. It does block out the sunlight but I just keep the front door open.

'Even if England get knocked out we'll keep the flags up until the end of the tournament.'

There has been a mixed reaction from neighbours of Mr Draper's home, which is a stone's throw from Southampton FC's home ground at St Mary's Stadium.

One amused German neighbour buried the hatchet of 1966 to take photographs of the unusual sight.

But another neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'I think it is a bit scruffy and there are too many flags.'

The tournament begins on Thursday in Brazil, with England's first match against Italy this Saturday in the Amazon rainforest city of Manaus.

England manager Roy Hodgson will lead out the side in the Brazilian heat as they look to get off to a flying start before playing Uruguay and Costa Rica.
