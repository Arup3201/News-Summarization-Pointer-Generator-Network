A fitness buff has drowned after trying to save his beloved boxer from the sea.

Sam Rizkallah, 58, who owned a laundry business in Largo, Florida, had attempted to reach four-year-old Oliver on Tuesday after he jumped in the water - but both were swept out to sea.

Rizkallah, who was married and enjoyed to run and work out, became so weak that he was unable to hold on to a rescue device and his body was recovered an hour later. Oliver the dog survived.

The family man was aboard his 27-foot boat with his brother, his niece, her husband and their children when he jumped into chest-deep water to anchor the bow, the Tampa Bay Times reported.

His boxer, who had also been aboard the boat, spied his owner in the water and jumped in to join him. But as he began to swim, he was swept away by a strong current, authorities said.

Rizkallah and his nieces husband, Todd Cochran, swam after his dog.

There were 'not in deep water,' Wildlife commission spokesman Gary Morse said. 'But a strong current can have an effect on you no matter how strong you are or how well you had previously planned.'

Another boater saw Rizkallah struggling in the water and threw him a lifeline but he was unable to hold on - due to the current or Rizkallah's exhaustion, Morse told the Times.

His body was found an hour later and the Medical Examiner's Office ruled he died of accidental drowning.

Now his devastated family are trying to come to terms with the loss of a fantastic father and friend.

Sam Rizkallah's wife

'He was a wonderful man, son, husband, brother, friend, uncle and great-uncle,' his wife Joanna Patterson, 54, said.

'This is all very shocking to everyone. He was a very strong man, and this is just out of nowhere.'

She had been in a business meeting in Las Vegas when she learned what had happened and took a red-eye flight home to be with her family early on Wednesday.

Rizkallah, whose full name was Isam, was originally from Palestine but immigrated to Detroit, Michigan in 1970 before moving to Clearwater, Florida in 1980 and meeting Patterson in 1993.

Loved: Oliver the four-year-old boxer survived the ordeal on Tuesday, but his owner passed away

She said that she was comforted knowing her husband passed away doing what he loved - 'doing what he always did, making others happy, with friends, family and Oliver on the water'.

'I truly loved this man,' she said. 'He was my hero and my best friend. He always took care of me.'

Morse,
 who noted that Rizkallah had not been wearing a life jacket, said that 
when people are trying to save their dogs from the water, the best idea 
is to follow them in a boat.

'Dogs will generally fend for themselves pretty well,' Morse said.

The family is holding a memorial service for Rizkallah at 2pm at Anona United Methodist Church.
