Malia Obama has headed back into the classroom during her summer vacation as she and her mother spent Thursday afternoon visiting an all-girls middle school during their first day in Senegal.

The First Family landed safely in Dakar on Wednesday evening and met with the Senegalese president and his wife on Thursday morning in the first leg of a highly-anticipated tour of Africa.

The First Lady and her eldest daughter were greeted by an expectant crowd of young girls and they happily sat on stage alongside Senegalese First Lady Marieme Faye Sall as the students showed off their dancing skills during a brief performance.

Social butterfly: In her first-ever Instagram, Mrs Obama posted a picture alongside some of the students saying that she was 'so inspired and so impressed by these extraordinary young women'

The first family's visit to the middle school was not the only key connection it has to America as it was named in honor of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.

Sasha is on the Africa trip but she did not go on the visit to the school. Instead, Malia had her cousin Leslie Robinson by her side.

This isn't the first time that Leslie has been a welcome addition for Malia, as the two cousins were seated very close to one another at President Obama's second inauguration and were seen joking before the swearing in ceremony.

Mrs Obama found the trip to the all-girls school as the perfect opportunity to launch her official Instagram account, and she has already posted three times since her visit. 

The first was a posed picture of she 
and Malia and Leslie alongside the school principal and some of the 
uniformed students. She indicated that she posted the photo herself by 
signing off with her initials after writing that she was 'so inspired 
and so impressed by these extraordinary young women'.

One
 of her staffers then took over and posted a video of the dance 
performance during the welcome ceremony and a more candid picture of the
 First Lady with a quote from her remarks at the school.

'You
 all are role models for my daughters, which is why I brought them here 
today - so that they could be inspired by you just like I am,' she told 
the crowd.

The students were given translated copies of Mrs Obama's remarks so that they could read along with her as she gave the speech from a podium.

'I know that some of you may be the first in your families to attend a school like Martin Luther King, so there might be people at home who don't quite understand what you're going through as you work to succeed here,' she said, explaining that she understood the sacrifices people make to put their children through school.

She used the ailing health of South African leader Nelson Mandela as a way to drive her point home with the school children.

'If President Mandela could endure being confined to a tiny cell, being forced to perform back-breaking labor, being separated from the people he loved most in the world, then surely, all of us, we can keep showing up and doing our best- showing up for school each day, studying as hard as you possibly can,' Mrs Obama said. 

'Surely, you can seize the kind of opportunities Mandela fought for for all of us; surely, you can honor his legacy by leaving a proud legacy of your own.'

President Barack Obama will be visiting three countries with First Lady Michelle and their daughters Sasha and Malia in tow.

However,
 the failing health of beloved former President Mandela is casting a shadow on the President's week- long visit - only 
his second since taking office.

Air Force One touched down in the 
Senegalese capital of Dakar on Wednesday evening. The president and his 
family are also scheduled to visit South Africa and Tanzania during their trip.

The White House is closely monitoring Mandela's health, which 
has added a degree of uncertainty to Obama's travel itinerary.

The 
94-year-old anti-apartheid leader has been hospitalized for about three 
weeks with a reoccurring lung infection and South African officials have
 now deemed his condition critical.

Obama advisers had been 
reluctant to publicly discuss what impact his condition might have on 
Obama's trip. There had been no formal plans for the two men to meet, 
though Obama aides did leave open the possibility of the U.S. president 
meeting with Mandela's family.

President Obama said today that his 'thoughts and 
prayers are with the Mandela family' and confirmed he still plans to 
travel there in coming days.

Despite
 scattered reports and rumours swirling online that Mandela is already 
dead, South African officials maintain that he is in a stable but 
critical condition.

The 
president is expected to be greeted warmly during his trip, despite the 
underlying sense of disappointment as this is only his second visit to the continent since taking office.

Obama's

 father was born in Kenya and several of his relatives still live there,
 but despite his family ties to the continent, Obama spent just one day 
in Africa during his first four years in office and has focused instead 
on strengthening U.S. ties with Asia and Latin America.

'Africans were very excited when 
President Obama was elected and they expected deeper engagement than in 
the past, both in regard to policy and also in terms of actual visits to
 the continent, given the president's African heritage,' said Mwangi 
Kimenyi, an Africa analyst at the Washington-based Brookings 
Institute.

'Africans 
have been gradually disappointed, especially when they look at the focus
 on Africa by previous presidents, in particular President Clinton and 
President George W. Bush, who did quite a bit there.'

Few
 major policy announcements are expected during Obama's trip. Instead, 
the president will focus on promoting democratic institutions, boosting 
opportunities for Africa's vast youth population and promoting the 
continent as a growing market for U.S. businesses.

The White House defended the purpose of the trip despite its low policy expectations.

'Presidential
 trips to regions of the world like Africa bring enormous benefits in 
terms of our relationship with the countries visited and the countries 
in the region,' spokesman Jay Carney told reporters traveling with Obama
 on Air Force One.

'The trip itself will not be the end point of our engagement, but will enhance it, deepen it and further it.'

The
 president will make two stops at sights that highlight the continent's 
harsh racial history: Senegal's Goree Island, which was the center of 
Atlantic slave trade and Robben Island, the apartheid-era prison in 
South Africa where Mandela spent 18 years of his 27 years in prison.

The
 president had no public events planned Wednesday after his arrival. He 
was scheduled to spend Thursday meeting with Senagalese President Macky 
Sall, then meet with civil society leaders at Goree Island.

Top White House economic advisers and U.S. business leaders were traveling with Obama, underscoring the trip's focus on boosting American economic ties with Africa.

Six of the world's 10 fastest-growing economies last year were in Africa, according to the World Bank.

While the U.S. has been slow to ramp up its trade with Africa, China, along with India, Malaysia and Brazil, have been building robust economic relationships on the continent.

Chinese officials say Beijing's trade with China totaled $200 billion last year. The U.S. Trade Representative said American trade with Africa reached $95 billion in 2011.
