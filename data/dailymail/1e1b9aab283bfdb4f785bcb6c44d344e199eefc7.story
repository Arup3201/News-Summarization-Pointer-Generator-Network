The family of a seven-year-old boy who died within a week of undergoing heart surgery have spoken of their anger after a report found that Bank Holiday staff shortages at an NHS hospital were partly to blame for the tragedy.

Luke Jenkins had been expected to make a full recovery from his operation but died over the Easter weekend after suffering a cardiac arrest at Bristol Children's Hospital.

A hospital investigation into his death uncovered a catalogue of avoidable errors, including the loss of vital time because junior staff did not know where to find resuscitation equipment.

Suffering: Luke Jenkins died within a week of undergoing corrective heart surgery at Bristol Children's Hospital

Because the emergency happened on a 
Bank Holiday weekend, a surgeon had to be called in from home to treat 
Luke, the inquiry found.

The
 contents of the report have shocked Luke's grieving parents, who 
believe their son would still be alive if he had received the care he 
needed.

Stephen Jenkins, 
30, and Faye Valentine, 27, of St Mellons, Cardiff, south Wales, have also 
raised concerns about the standard of the investigation into Luke's 
death.

Mr Jenkins said: 'Luke fought it (his heart condition) as hard as he could but in the end they let him down.

'He wanted to grow up to be a doctor - he wanted to help children, he didn't want anyone to suffer like he had.

'We're fighting this for him. We want answers and we want to raise awareness. What about the children who are there now?'

Luke was born with a congenital heart defect and had already undergone two of three corrective operations.

He went into the hospital for the third operation and it was deemed a success. He was initially kept in intensive care but was transferred to another ward, Ward 32, after a few days.

He suffered a cardiac arrest on Good Friday.

Junior nursing staff lost vital time 
because they did not know where resuscitation equipment on Ward 32 was kept.

The emergency team was also unfamiliar with the equipment because cardiac arrest was rare in the ward environment.

The
 fact that Luke suffered a cardiac arrest on Good Friday meant that the 
duty surgeon was at home when he collapsed and had to be urgently called
 in to attend hospital.

The investigators' report, called a 'root cause analysis' (RCA), does not specify when the call was made, but it states that the surgeon was at the scene within 19 minutes.

'On the 6th April when the patient 
deteriorated it was a bank holiday; although it is recognised that the 
resuscitation team arrived quickly,' the document states.

'The cardiac surgeon had responded from home and had the chest open within 19 minutes of the emergency call.'

What is clear is that Luke's heart 
stopped for 43 minutes before he was resuscitated, after which he 
underwent exploratory surgery. He died the following day.

While staff numbers on the ward was 
set according to official guidance, low staff levels had been a problem 
for at least two years.

'A 
risk assessment identifying low and unsafe nurse staffing and high 
dependency patient acuity issues was developed following a high-risk 
incident in October 2010 remains outstanding,' the report states.

There
 have been eight separate patient safety incidents on the ward since 
January, two of which prompted 'high-risk' investigations.

All eight were linked to problems of low staffing levels.

Other
 worrying factors include the resetting of potentially vital alarms on 
Luke's condition monitoring equipment after his arrival on Ward 32.

'The
 patient was frequently triggering the alarms on his monitoring 
equipment; and the family witnessed the alarms being reset to a lower 
threshold by the nursing staff to stop the alarms from being activated,'
 the report states.

'Triggering the alarms did not appear to trigger a medical review.'

The 40-page report makes eight recommendations and draws a raft of conclusions based on the experience of Luke's tragic death.

But the child's parents claim the report is less than honest and fails to give a true picture of what really happened.

Concerns: Luke Jenkins's parents believe he would still be alive if he had received the care he needed

They
 claim a series of factual errors appear to combine to hide the full 
extent of the negligence their son suffered.

An assertion that Luke 
underwent an x-ray the day before his death is questioned in a letter 
sent in reply to the report.

'If
 he had had an X-ray they would have found what was wrong with him and 
he would still be here now,' said Mr Jenkins. 'But we were 
with him all day and we know that it never happened.'

He said that the family intended to fight on until the full truth was revealed.

'If he had an X-ray they would have found what was wrong with him and he would still be here now.'

'There
 have been eight other incidents since January 2012. They cannot tell us
 who the people were but that should be made public,' Mr Jenkins said.

'We have written saying that we are not happy with the report.'

He said one major problem was that nursing staff failed to listen to them when they were anxiously calling for help for Luke.

That
 view is supported by the report itself, which states: 'Failure to 
listen to the 'voice of the patient' is recognised to be a major 
contributory factor in patient safety investigations.'

However,
 it concluded: 'The RCA team were unable to comment on whether listening
 to the family on this occasion would have changed the patient outcome.'
