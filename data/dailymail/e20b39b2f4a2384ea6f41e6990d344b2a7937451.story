Members of Generation Y are still thought of as lazy by older executives and managers, with millennials placing more importance on finding meaning in their work rather than attempting to climb the corporate ladder.

Generation expert Tamara Erickson said that industry executives often view Generation Y workers as not wanting to 'pay their dues.'

One of Australia's top chefs, Luke Mangan, has echoed this, claiming apprentices have a lazy work ethic which hurt both the restaurant industry and their futures.

When Mr Mangan, who now also creates menus for Virgin Australia, started his apprenticeship nearly 30 years ago, he was working between 70 and 80 hour weeks.

The 44-year-old has been working in the industry for decades, and is set to open his 20th restaurant this year. 

When Mr Mangan, who now also creates menus for Virgin Australia, started his apprenticeship nearly 30 years ago, he was working between 70 and 80 hour weeks.

He claims that apprentices now 'look at their watch at 38 hours', reported news.com.au.

'You do not learn a profession by taking short cuts or just doing the hours you have to do,' Mr Mangan said.

'You’ve got to put in hard work and commit to it and I think I’ve done that.' 

However, Ms Erickson, who was listed as one of the World’s Top 50 Business Thinkers in 2013, said that millennials are often seen as lazy or entitled as a result of world events which have shaped a belief that the world is unpredictable.

Influenced by the September 11 attacks and other acts of terror has shaped Generation Y's view that life is best lived in the moment, to the fullest, as they cannot foresee what might happen.

'Frankly, [Gen Y] don’t want to do some grubby job for five years in the hope it pays off,' she told BRW.

She encourages managers to encourage millennials to be innovative, and to be flexible enough to allow their younger employees to explore different avenues of their approach to work. 

Generation expert Tamara Erickson said that industry executives often view Generation Y workers as not wanting to 'pay their dues.'

'One way to make even menial tasks more challenging is to let them [Gen Ys] figure out how to do them,' she says.

A recent study by Deloitte revealed that collaboration and teamwork were extremely important to Generation Y, with 59% reporting that they worked better in teams, as opposed to 33% of baby boomers. 

Global HR firm Randstad highlighted this trend in a survey they released which indicated that two thirds of Australians have reported that they spend far more time collaborating with colleagues than five years ago.

Driven by technology developments which allow for employees to communicate, the study has shown that $46 billion was added to the Australian economy through collaboration.

This serves to emphasize Ms Erickson's belief that encouraging Generation Y to explore new avenues for working may improve productivity. 

'We’ve seen workplaces really change quite significantly over last 20 years or so,' Steve Shepherd, employment market analyst at Randstad, told news.com.au.

'We now have technology that enables us to share information in real-time, and gen Y is much stronger in that area. It’s also a product of how they’ve grown up,' he said.

'The education system now focuses much more on collaboration — working on group assignments, for example. It’s really become second nature for them.'

'One of the things that came through in the study is if you measure performance on outcomes that are individually driven, then you’re not necessarily encouraging collaborative behaviour,' he said.

Work-life balance is also important to Generation Y, who are far more entrepreneurial, value life outside of work and want to travel.

Millennials also desire an employer who is supportive, and understands a desire for flexible hours and is open to the option of working from home, reported Hays. 

For Mr Mangan, this may translate into self-entitlement in work ethic.

'People want to get somewhere too quick, they don’t want to put in the hard work,' he said.

'There are no shortcuts in this industry.'
