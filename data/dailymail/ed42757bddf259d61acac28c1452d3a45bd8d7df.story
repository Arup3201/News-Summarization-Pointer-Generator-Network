Manchester United will rely on homegrown talent as they begin their 2014-15 FA Youth Cup campaign with a tie against Bury at Old Trafford on Tuesday night.

United are due to field a side in which all but three of the squad have been with the club since the age of seven.

The exceptions are defender Timothy Fosu-Mensah, who came from Ajax, Tyler Reid, formerly of Arsenal, and goalkeeper Dean Henderson from Carlisle United.

The line-up will be similar to the one that drew 0-0 with neighbours Liverpool in the U18 League at Altrincham earlier this month.

Coach Paul McGuinness said: ‘We’ve got younger players coming up and it’s only going to improve them. We played three or four schoolboys at Liverpool early in the season and it was a shock to the system because they weren’t quite ready for it.

‘Now they’ve had a few games, they are more experienced and we hoped it would be a different story in the home match with Liverpool. Certainly, they’ve improved a lot and I think this team will continue to improve.’

McGuinness spoke to Manutd.com about why he has such affinity with the FA Youth Cup.

The U18s coach was in charge of the 2011 side that lifted the trophy and his father, former United player and manager Wilf, won the competition in 1954, 1955 and 1956 and captained the side in the third of those seasons. In total, he played 27 ties and is one of only five players to have earned three winners’ medals.

‘The competition means a lot to me,’ said Paul. I grew up with my dad telling me how he won FA Youth Cups with the Busby Babes. He played more FA Youth Cup games than anybody else - there were only a few of them who played in all the fixtures - and he’s got that record so I grew up with all of that.

‘I wanted to play in the FA Youth Cup myself but I only had a brief substitute appearance when I was playing here [against Barnsley in 1984]. I was still at school at the time.

‘In my time as a coach, it’s been great as well. I can honestly say, while the goal is to win the FA Youth Cup of course, it is not the biggest thing. It’s the experience the players gain from having a run in the competition.

‘The year we got to the final when Danny Welbeck was in the team as a schoolboy, the experience he gained there stood him in good stead playing for United and England at the top level. I know that run helped him go such a long way.

‘It’s more what the FA Youth Cup can do itself in preparing players for bigger challenges with competitive football and a simulation of first-team football. If you get to the end of it, you deal with big crowds and extra pressure. The most important thing about it is to win it and it’s a massive bonus as it really helps you but it’s the process along the way.

‘You can see them develop in front of your own eyes if they get through each round. The problem can easily be when you go out as it’s a cup competition and you can lose in the first round. Then you miss that opportunity.

‘We’re making some progress by playing matches at Altrincham this season and we need to simulate that kind of game whether we’re in the FA Youth Cup or not. But, in English football, the FA Youth Cup is still one of the most special tournaments to play in.

‘A number of them are ready to make quite a bit of a breakthrough and it would definitely help to have a little run in the FA Youth Cup.’

Ro-Shaun Williams missed the draw with Liverpool due to injury, with Timothy Fosu-Mensah dropping into defence, while Demetri Mitchell remains sidelined. The cup tie is also live on MUTV as United strive to win the competition for the first time since 2011.

United (probable): Henderson; Reid, Tuanzebe, Fosu-Mensah, Borthwick-Jackson; Scott, Redmond; Riley, Gribbin, Dearnley, Rashford.
