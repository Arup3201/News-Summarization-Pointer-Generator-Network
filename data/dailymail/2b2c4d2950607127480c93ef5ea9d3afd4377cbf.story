Not guilty plea: Two Oklahoma teenagers charged in the alleged 'thrill kill' of Australian baseball player Christopher Lane, pictured, in Oklahoma pleaded not guilty and waived their right to a speedy trial Thursday

Two Oklahoma teenagers charged in the
 alleged 'thrill kill' of an Australian baseball player in Oklahoma 
pleaded not guilty and waived their right to a speedy trial Thursday.

Michael
 Dewayne Jones, 18, and Chancey Allen Luna, 16, wore orange jail 
jumpsuits and their hands were cuffed as Judge
 Joe Enos set a trial date of August 18.

The teens are charged 
with first-degree murder in the shooting death last summer of 
22-year-old Christopher Lane.

Prosecutors
 say Lane, from Melbourne, was gunned down as he jogged near his 
girlfriend's parents' house in Duncan, about 80 miles south of Oklahoma 
City. He was preparing to enter his senior season as a catcher at East 
Central University in Ada.

Another
 teenage defendant, James Francis Edwards Jr., 16, agreed to testify 
against Jones and Luna if prosecutors reduce charges against him.

Edwards
 testified at the preliminary hearing for Luna and Jones last month that
 he was rolling joints in the front passenger seat when Luna fired the 
fatal shot from the back while Jones drove.

Luna and Jones both said they had believed the gun used in the killing held blanks, not a live round, Edwards testified.

Edwards
 was charged with accessory after the fact because prosecutors say he 
made a phone call from the Stephens County Jail between August 16 and 
December 31, 2013, and asked someone to dispose of the weapon.

He is due back in court in May for a preliminary hearing for that charge.

Bad aim: Michael Jones, shown left on March 12, reportedly told an inmate that he and his friends tried to shoot several people the day they killed Lane but 'kept missing'

Trial: Chancey Luna, shown left on March 12, and Michael Jones were in court for a hearing before their murder trial for allegedly shooting Chris Lane. This Thursday a date was set for the trial

Prosecutors
 have said they will drop the first-degree murder charge in exchange for
 him continuing to testify against the other two teenagers through 
trial.

A lawyer for Jones has filed a motion seeking all agreements between the state and witnesses, specifically Edwards.

Family
 members for both teens were in attendance Thursday, as was Lane's 
distraught girlfriend. All left without comment following the hearing.

A gag order prevents lawyers and others from discussing the case outside of court.

Last week, the Oklahoma court was told that one of the three teenagers accused of 
murdering Lane said they tried to shoot 
other people 'but kept missing.'

Heather
 George, who works at the Stephens county jail where the three teenagers
 were held after Lane was killed, testified on March 12 that she had 
overheard a conversation between two inmates, one of whom was Michael Jones.

Jones, the
 alleged driver of the car used in the drive-by shooting, was having a conversation with another inmate, George said.

'Thugs': Michael Jones (center) and Chancey Luna (right) face first degree murder charges for the shooting of Christopher Lane.  James Edwards (left) is now facing accessory charge after he cooperated with police

Questionable: Friends claimed Edwards (center) and Luna (right) were trying to join the local chapter 
of the notorious Crips gang, and they posted pictures to their Facebook 
where they are holding gang signs

The
 other inmate, according to George, asked Jones: 'Why did you have to 
shoot an Australian? Why didn't you drive and shoot somebody else?'

George said Jones had replied: 'We tried to shoot several other people, but we kept missing.'

At
 the conclusion of the preliminary hearing, Judge Jerry Herberger 
ordered 18-year-old Jones and the 16-year-old alleged shooter, Chancey 
Luna, to stand trial for the first-degree murder of Chris Lane.

The
 third murder accused, James Edwards, who was 15 on 16 August last year 
when Lane was shot in the back and left to die on the side of a Duncan, 
Oklahoma, street, has become a prosecution witness.

Edwards
 told the preliminary hearing Luna had fired the .22 revolver that 
struck Lane as the Australian jogged, but only after the Ford Focus 
driven by Jones swerved unexpectedly.

Luna had later said he thought the
 gun was loaded with blanks, Edwards said.

In
 another twist, Howard and Jim Berry, the two lawyers representing Luna,
 were charged with contempt of court on Wednesday after talking to 
reporters about the case last month.Â

Shock: Residents of Duncan have been moved by the murder that attracted worldwide attention

A
 gag order has been placed on the lawyers and prosecutors involved in 
the case. The Berrys, who are cousins, entered not guilty pleas.

Shortly
 after the shooting, police said Jones told investigators that the three
 were 'bored' and decided to kill someone for the 'fun of it'.

It was later suspected that Lane's murder was race related.

One
 of Edwards' friends, Serenity Jackson, told The Associated Press she 
didn't believe race was a factor in the shooting. She noted that Luna's 
mother, Edwards' girlfriend and Jones are white.

'It has nothing to do with Chris being white. They didn't even know who he was,' said Jackson, 17, who grew up with Edwards.

It had previously emerged that Edwards
 had posted on his Twitter profile that he 'hated white people' and 
boasted that
 he beat up five white people - using the derogatory term 'woods' - 
after the George Zimmerman acquittal in the Trayvon Martin case.

'Ayeee I knocced out 5 woods since Zimmerman court!:) lol sh*t ima keep sleepin sh*t! #ayeeee,' he wrote.

In another, he said: '90% of white ppl are nasty. #HATE THEM'.

But Duncan Police Chief Danny Ford said that 
rather than being part of any gang, which had been suggested before, 
authorities believe the boys were just wannabes who were emulating the 
thuggish beliefs of their idols, with rapper Chief Keef being prime suspect.

Tough guy: Edwards posted videos of him tossing around guns and looking threatening in a blue bandana associated with the notorious Crips gang

It emerged that the day before 
Edwards is alleged to have shot dead Christopher in a drive-by from
 a black Ford Focus, he tweeted about rapper Chief Keef.

Two
 days earlier he posted a chilling tweet that was a lyric from the 
rapper's song I Don't Like.

It read: 'With my n****s when it's time to 
start taken life's' (sic). Other lyrics in the same song include 'pistol
 toting and I'm shooting on sight'.

Ford said: 'These boys were more into 
some rapper that goes around, his music is violent. More than gang 
stuff. One of the parents said something about rap.

'These
 boys have no respect for life or authority or society, it doesn't 
matter who it is. By one of their own words, they saw him go by, and 
they said, "there's the target" and they followed him and shot him. He 
could have been anybody walking down the street.'

The small town has been rocked by the 
senseless murder that has sent shockwaves around the world, leaving many
 wondering what drove the 'bored' boys to apparently kill just for the 
thrill of it.

Because 
of Lane's nationality, the case has gained national attention, but some 
have criticized the White House for not reacting strongly enough.

A
 State Department spokeswoman put out a statement last year saying that 
the federal government is 'deeply saddened' by Lane's death but she did 
not comment on any specific action.

Australia's
 former Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer called for his fellow 
countrymen to think of this shooting when they are planning a trip to 
the United States.
