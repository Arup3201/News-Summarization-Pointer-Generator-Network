Chris Robshaw has been endorsed as the man to captain England at the World Cup, days after leading a tunnel stand-off in Cardiff which set the defiant tone for his side's heroic victory.

The Harlequins flanker has been the established skipper throughout Stuart Lancaster's three-year tenure, but he has always had to earn the right to retain the job on a tournament-by-tournament basis. Now, however, the national coach has made an unprecedented declaration of long-term faith in Robshaw's capacity to fulfil the role.

Lancaster's instinct is to avoid nailing his colours to the mast but he said: 'Players get injured and things happen that are out of your control. But it would take a big change of heart now to move from the direction we're going with Chris.

'I've got other good players in the back row who are all desperate for an opportunity, but Chris has been excellent and we need to make sure we continue to back him. We certainly will in this Six Nations and, fingers crossed, he'll be fit and available for June.'

That suggests only injury can deny Robshaw the honour of leading the host nation into the World Cup, which represents emphatic progress for the 28-year-old. He has been captain in 32 of the 33 Tests he has played for his country but even as recently as last June, at the end of England's trip to New Zealand, the coaches were voicing grave misgivings about the openside's breakdown credentials and inviting a challenge from other specialist English No 7s.

During the autumn, Robshaw was caught up in the criticism which came England's way after defeats against the All Blacks and South Africa. But he finished the November series with a towering performance in the victory over Australia and then led by example at the Millennium Stadium.

Lancaster said: 'He's been excellent. Confidence in his ability as a player is the fundamental thing behind leadership. You've got to be secure of your place in the team. He's earned that and he earns it on a weekly basis.

'He did it again against Wales with the number of tackles he made, the turnovers he made and his contribution to the game. We look at people's involvement, not just in the rucks but in their work-rate off the ball. He's continually at the top of that as well.

'He's earned the respect of all the players and as a consequence he's leading them effectively. But he's also got the strength of solidarity from the leaders around him as well. They back him up to the hilt.'

In the moments before kick-off last Friday, Robshaw illustrated his increasing authority by resolutely refusing to lead his team down the tunnel until receiving assurances that Wales would not keep them waiting in the cold for long. It was a stance which infuriated the hosts and set a bloody-minded tone for what was to follow.

It was a stance which infuriated the hosts and set a bloody-minded tone for what was to follow.

Lancaster attempted to down-play the significance of that stand-off but asked if his skipper would have done the same thing before the RBS 6 Nations opener at Murrayfield in 2012, he said: 'It wouldn't have been a decision I'd have encouraged him to make in what was my first game in charge.

'You take your time to find your feet. We have that confidence and belief now. There are a lot of players in the changing room who have played in big games, not only for their clubs, but also internationally. That investment in the last two to three years is beginning to tell.

'There is a fine line but I'd hate to think we come across as an arrogant team because I don't think we are. But you want to show what you are about as a group and that possibly showed in that moment. I'd like to think there is no arrogance in the team but growing confidence.'

England are likely to field an unchanged starting XV against Italy at Twickenham on Saturday, despite having Brad Barritt, Kyle Eastmond and Geoff Parling back in training after injuries. Among the other casualties, Alex Corbisiero and Stephen Myler are expected to play for Northampton on Friday, while fellow Saints Courtney Lawes and Tom Wood should be fit for the clash with Ireland in Dublin on March 1.

But Manu Tuilagi is unlikely to feature in the championship and it is not certain when Bath prop David Wilson will recover from a neck problem.
