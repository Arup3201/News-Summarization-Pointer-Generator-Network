Citroen C4 Cactus Flair 1.6 Blue HDi 100 

Price as driven: £20,325

GOOD

Citroen's perky new motor will be too late for buyers to have the cachet of being seen with a '64' plate on Monday, but when it does becomes available in October, I reckon the C4 Cactus will bloom.

This French back-to-basics family car combines simplicity and efficiency with practicality, low ownership costs and quirky looks.

Door grips and fabric trim are styled in the manner of traditional suitcases.

The Citroen Cactus Flair 1.6 Blue HDi accelerates to 62mph in 10.7 seconds and has a top speed of 114mph

A nimble ride on its 17-in alloy wheels, it has a tight turning circle and electric power steering which makes parking easy. Not the fastest kid off the blocks, but its willing 1.6 litre HDi four-cylinder in-line turbodiesel engine is enough for the family shop or a run up the M1.

Accelerates from rest to 62mph in 10.7 seconds and has a top speed of 114mph.

Citroen claims an average 83.1 mpg, rising to more than 88mpg when cruising.

The distinctive 'Airbumps' — a series of blister panels — are designed to absorb minor side impacts such as a ding from a shopping trolley.

The world's first passenger airbag in the roof means more storage in the dashboard.

Prices from £12,990 for the 1.2 litre PureTech 75 manual up to £18,190 for the 1.6 litre e-HDi 92 ETG6.

Upmarket, hi-tech, clutter-free dashboard, with digital controls grouped around a single large 7-in touch screen.

BAD

For a back-to-basics car, £20k might seem steep. But this did include a lot of extra options. The £17,990 base price of the Flair 1.6 Blue HDi 100 was bumped up by a trim pack at £695, sunroof (£395), city park pack (£325), emergency and assistance system (£250) and other refinements.

Something of a blind spot looking left and to the back from the driver's seat — the direction from which 'under-cutting' cyclists will be coming.

Also the passenger seat slightly obscures the view out towards the rear left-hand side window.

Some of the plastics feel light and cheap — the handbrake in particular.
