Extremist: Anjem Choudary warned today there could be more 'lone wolf' attacks as he blamed British troops in Afghanistan for the slaughter of a soldier

Hate preacher Anjem Choudary today blamed the continuing presence of British troops in Afghanistan for the slaughter of a soldier in Woolwich.

The extremist claimed he attended the same mosque as terror suspect Michael Adebolajo, 28, who was reportedly one of the two men arrested in connection with the brutal killing.

Choudary, who in the past has planned to
disrupt the minute's silence on Remembrance Sunday, said there could be
more 'lone wolf' attacks.

The off-duty serviceman was hacked to death in broad daylight in south-east London yesterday just 200 yards from the Royal Military Barracks.

Clutching a bloodied meat cleaver, the 
man suspected of executing the soldier declared: 'you 
and your kids will be next'.

Hate preacher Choudary today blamed the war in Afghanistan for the brutal killing.

He said: 'We must concentrate on why this incident took place.

'That is the presence of British 
forces in Muslim countries and the atrocities they’ve committed, and how
the Muslim community in this country are under pressure due to 
draconian laws which have tried to silence them.'

However, Choudary today described Adebolajo as a man of 'impeccable character'.

The suspect and his unnamed accomplice are believed to have run down the soldier with a Vauxhall Tigra as he walked back to the Woolwich Barracks at 2.20pm yesterday, crushing his body against a road sign.

Witnesses said the terror suspects then 'hacked and chopped' at his body like 'crazed animals', before dragging his corpse into the middle of the road leaving a trail of blood.

Listen to the interview below

Changed man: Suspect Michael Adebolajo is said to have been radicalised in 2003 as a schoolboy and his parents became so concerned they moved him away 

As they apparently tried to decapitate him they were chanting 'Allah Akbar!’ – an Islamic phrase meaning ‘God is great’ - and yelling 'this is what God would have wanted'.

A blood-soaked man identified as Adebolajo, who was still holding a number of weapons in his red-stained hands, then ranted on camera in a clear London accent saying: 'You people will never be safe' before telling a passer-by they had not fled because they were waiting to 'shoot the police'.

Within 20 minutes armed officers arrived and the fundamentalists charged at them wielding firearms, knives and a machete.

Police opened fire, shooting six bullets, leaving one seriously injured. The pair remain under armed guard in two separate London hospitals.

Choudary claimed to have known the suspect from Mulgrave Primary school, which is located next to the scene of the massacre.

Speaking to Channel 4 News, he said the man he knew as Mujahid had converted to Islam in 2003.

'I can see from the clip yesterday 
that one of them is brother Mujahid. He's a revert to Islam... He used 
to attend a few years ago some of the activities that we had - 
demonstrations, processions and some of the lectures,' he said.

Mr Choudary said he did not think 
Mujahid was a member of any political organisations, and that he mainly 
attended activities that were open to the public.

'As far as I'm aware he was a normal,
practising Muslim, concerned about the Muslim affairs worldwide and he 
believed that there's a covenant of security in fact: that in return for
our life and wealth being protected, we're not allowed to target the 
life and wealth of those with whom we live,' the former Al Muhajiroun 
leader added.

'He's a very nice man - I believe 
he's a family man. He's a very calm and non-violent man. As you can see 
from the clip yesterday he was concerned and apologising to any women 
and children who were there.'

He said: 'I saw the pictures of him last night, his name is Michael Adebolajo.

'I went to the same primary school as him in Woolwich, Mulgrave, and grew up in the same area and he came to the local mosque - it was a peaceful community with lots of Muslim people from Somalia and Pakistan. I didn’t know him that well so I can’t say where his family was from.'

Choudary led Islamist group Al-Muhajiroun, the banned forerunner to Islam 4 UK, where Adebolajo often appeared alongside other radical protesters.

Mr Choudary continued: 'He converted around 2003 to Islam, before I met him and I knew him as his convert name "Mujaheed" when he used to attend our demonstrations and lectures.

'I last saw him in 2011, he was a very nice man with impeccable character and nothing unusual about him.'

Choudary claims that he was 'making his voice heard' with his rant after the attack.

He said: 'What he did was unusual and it’s not the kind of view that I propagate and I do not condone the use of violence, but those views are out there.

'Some members of the Muslim community struggle to express themselves and he is making his voice heard in blood.'

Choudary suggested that it was possible the attack was motivated by the Government's foreign policy in the Muslim world, and that this may not have been an isolated incident.

He said: 'We are a very politicised community. Some people are angered by draconian measures such as ‘stop and search’ and restrictions on free speech.

'There is a chance of more lone wolf attacks happening again due to these draconian measures.

'If you want to condemn anyone it’s the British Government, this is one death but if you add up the number of people killed and tortured by the British Government it is in the millions.'

The two men are thought to be British citizens with Nigerian connections who had converted to a radical form of Islam.

Prime Minister David Cameron said today that the attack 'sickens us all' and was a 'betrayal of Islam'.

Speaking outside Downing Street, he said the attack would bring the UK together and 'make us stronger'.

'The people who did this were trying to divide us. They should know something like this will only bring us together and make us stronger,' he said.

'This country will be absolutely resolute in its stand against violent extremism and terror. We will never give in to terror or terrorism in any of its forms.

'This view is shared by every community in our country. This was not just an attack on Britain and on the British way of life; it was also a betrayal of Islam and of the Muslim communities who give so much to our country.

'There is nothing in Islam that justifies this truly dreadful act.'

He said the best response was for everyone to 'go about our normal lives'.

The Muslim Council of Britain described the attack as 'a truly barbaric act'.

They said in a statement: 'This is a truly barbaric act that has
no basis in Islam and we condemn this unreservedly. Our thoughts are 
with the victim and his family.

'We
understand the victim is a serving member of the Armed Forces. Muslims 
have long served in this country’s Armed Forces, proudly and with 
honour.

'This attack on a member of the Armed Forces is dishonourable, and no cause justifies this murder.'

A growing pile of flowers and cards have been left outside Woolwich army barracks, just yards from where the soldier was killed.

One military family who left flowers wrote: 'To a hero taken from us too soon, may you rest in peace. Always in our hearts, Martin, Faye and Hope, fellow soldier family.'

Another wrote: 'Much love and respect to a true hero so savagely taken from us. RIP Dan, Kellie, JJ and Clark, a fellow soldier.'

Among the growing pile of floral tributes are two small wooden Remembrance Day wooden crosses with a single red poppy attached.

One read: 'In remembrance of the soldier killed in Woolwich, God Bless.'
