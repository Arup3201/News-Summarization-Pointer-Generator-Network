Ally Mullany died 'almost instantly' after her car crashed into an oncoming fire engine that was responding to another nearby accident

A headteacher was killed when her car crashed into a fire engine after veering into its path while taking an unfamiliar diversion, an inquest heard.

Ally Mullany, 50, died almost instantly when her red Mini Cooper ploughed into the 15-tonne vehicle that was on its way to another fatal accident nearby.

Mrs Mullany from, Lytchett Matravers, near Poole, was driving two of her children to a horse riding competition when she was forced to take the route near Wareham, Dorset.

But after straying onto the other side of the road, the married mother-of-four crashed into the oncoming fire engine.

The inquest was told the incident occurred as the fire crew was responding to a radio call alerting them to another road accident victim on the A35, who died after crashing into a tree.

Firefighter Andrew Cobb, the truck’s driver, said the vehicle was travelling at around 36mph with blue lights on when he saw Mrs Mullany's car drift into its path.

Mr Cobb said he made a 'split second decision' to avoid any collision by swerving onto the opposite side of the road.

However at the last moment the car veered back onto the correct side of the carriageway, leading to the head-on crash.

Mr Cobb said: 'As I came over a hill I saw a car gradually come into our lane until it was almost fully on the wrong side of the road.

'I made a split second decision to go round the vehicle.

'I was hoping we would be able to pass each other or just clip but at the last moment the car driver swerved back to the left and we collided.'

Mrs Mullany was driving her 11-year-old daughter and 14-year-old son to a horse riding competition at nearby Bovington Saddle Club when the accident occurred.

Both children were injured and taken to hospital after being cut from the car by firefighters, but have since recovered from their injuries.

Mrs Mullany was the headteacher of St Joseph’s Catholic Combined School in Poole, having previously worked in London and Singapore.

A post mortem examination revealed she suffered a fractured skull due to 'massive cerebral trauma'.

Bournemouth coroner Sheriff Payne ruled Mrs Mullany died as the result of a vehicle collision.

He said: 'Sadly the impact appears to have been caused by driver error on the part of Alison Mullany.

'For some reason she failed to negotiate a left hand bend that was presented to her.

'It was a tragic accident. The only benefit that has come out of it is two of her children survived the incident and were not more affected.'
