Jannah Reid has no need for an alarm clock to wake her three children for school. The daily dawn chorus in her tower block apartment in downtown Damascus is the thump of rockets fired from Syrian army artillery batteries in the hills surrounding the country's capital or the roar of government MiG fighter jets overhead.

Dundee-born Jannah is trapped in a war zone. The teacher can't leave because she needs the written permission of her estranged Syrian husband to take her two younger sons, Ridwaan, 11, and Hashem, ten, out of the country. He is currently living in exile in Saudi Arabia and doesn't reply to her letters.

'Some days are worse than others,' says Jannah, 51. 'I'll feel trapped and scared by the bombing going on around me, but then the next day, the situation quietens.'

As we speak, another salvo of rockets fires out from the hilltop. The noise appears not to faze her children – her oldest son, from her first marriage, is 19-year-old Talal. But Jannah is clearly rattled.

The UN says at least 70,000 people have been killed since protests against President Bashar al-Assad began two years ago.

In the past few days, 15 students died at the university after a mortar strike and ten shells have exploded within half a mile of Jannah's office during heavy fighting in the capital. She has lost two close friends to the conflict, one to a bomb and one to a sniper bullet. At least a dozen of her former students have been killed.

'I fret and cry daily about our safety and the lack of money,' she admits. 'Every time a child is late home, I think they have been killed or held at one of the military checkpoints as they cross town to school.

'I've friends who say it'll all be over in two months but they've been saying that for two years. Others think it'll be like Algeria, and that went on for eight years, or Lebanon – six years. My feeling is it's a stalemate because both sides have so much outside support. I think the war will go on for at least another five or six years.'

The violence all around is the new normal in Damascus. 'Yesterday, a small truck suicide bomb went off within 200 metres of the park my children were playing in,' she adds.

'Ridwaan told me, ''Mum, it was like an earthquake. The ground was moving.'''

She speaks with only a hint of a Scottish brogue after years of living in London – where she worked as a dental hygienist and then as sales manager for a medical finance company – and almost a decade in Syria.

Brought up a Roman Catholic, she was educated at the £10,000-a-year High School of Dundee and currently teaches English to businessmen and students at the Sky Education Institute in the tax-free business zone, across the city in West Damascus. 

Her daily journey involves lengthy detours on foot to avoid the checkpoints, where one false move can see you arrested, roughed up or worse. 'I'm more worried about Talal when it comes to the checkpoints,' she says.

'At 19, he is rebel fighting age and a target for checks. He has to show his papers every time. But as soon as he shows his British passport, he flies through “Go go go! Go quickly!” they tell him.'Talal says the official Syrian army checkpoints present no problems. Instead, he fears the unpredictable, untrained rebel forces.

'The biggest threat for me are definitely the free army,' he says. 'I hate it all. In truth I'm a complete pacifist. I don't want to see any weapons in this world.' Jannah's three boys are a credit to her.

'They sometimes calm me down when I leap up hearing an explosion,' she says. 'They say, “Calm down, Mum – it's just the rebels or the government farting.” To them it's normal now.

'I love Syria. I'm so sad about the situation here, I cry every day. The people are incredible, so friendly, so helpful.

We'd all cry if we had to leave – and we
may have to once we can. But at the moment we're stuck here because my 
two younger boys' father is Syrian. They have a well-known Damascene 
surname. I need power of attorney from their father to get their 
passports stamped to leave the country.'

She does not know where he is living in Saudi Arabia. Now, though, she has discovered he is wanted by Syrian police for alleged non-repayment of government loans connected with his academic studies in Britain. Because of that, she now hopes divorce might be possible in a matter of months.

Jannah's story is as tangled as it is sad. After her first marriage collapsed, she converted to Islam in Britain, but was targeted by a fundamentalist sect, the Salafee, who put pressure on her to marry an adherent. She has now renounced the Salafee and holds moderate views. 

'The pressure never let up and I eventually married my husband after meeting him for three hours – as Salafee rules dictate. I made a premarital verbal agreement that we would live in his home country. He promised he would finish his PhD in six months and we would move to Syria.

'But I then discovered he was in danger of deportation. I had to apply for a visa so he could continue his studies. Four years later, he still had not completed his PhD and we were still in the UK. Apart from two short periods of maternity leave, I supported the family almost unaided. If he gave me money for the weekly shop, it was never more than £50.

'I sold my home in Chiswick, West London, and bought a new property in Colchester. He began work to extend it, but the money ran out. He used up my overdraft and suggested borrowing money to complete the home and then move to Syria. I borrowed £25,000.'

 He was supposed to pay the monthly payments, but never did. 'I moved to Syria in 2004 with £15,000, leaving £10,000 with him to finish the work – which was not done. I'm not even sure if all the windows are in place. I don't even have the keys.

'I brought the boys to Syria, and hired part-time help in my home and went to work teaching English. Then, in 2006, his friend came and took the remaining £1,000 back for him. He visited us perhaps for less than 50 days in the years between 2004 and 2010, when I last saw him.

'My husband is now wanted in Syria for taking money from the university to study for his doctorate, then never completing it and not returning to work at the university to fulfil his contract. I am trying to use that to gain a divorce.'

Meantime, she struggles to feed her sons in a country ravaged by the conflict and by the inflationary effects of international sanctions and profiteering.

'My rent has gone up 30 per cent in six months. Bread and gas cylinders for cooling and heating – it's all three, four, five times more expensive than before the war.'

She has no choice but to work long hours, teaching English for 12 hours most days. The boys make their own sandwiches before going to school.

'I've no choice but to work long hours just to stay above water. It's frightening. I speak English. I'm a graduate. I can earn decent money for Syria and still I'm really struggling. So what about the 80-odd per cent of people who earn less than me? How are they coping?

'I worry and cry daily about not having enough money to live. The sanctions are killing as many people here as the fighting. 

'The exchange rate used to be 47 Syrian lira to the US dollar – now it's about 120 lira. A bottle of LPG gas for cooking that used to cost 240 lira this week cost me 2,400 lira.

'We lived the whole winter with no diesel fuel to fill the heater and we had severe cold and snow. And there are power cuts often, up to three times daily for about three hours each. During the snow, the power was off for more than 36 hours.'

'You need money to leave. I have none. Where would I store our belongings or do I just abandon everything? How could I move back to Britain, where I have no savings? Would I find a job? I'm terrified of not having enough money to feed my children – or even that I might lose my children because of this.'

There has been no British Embassy in Damascus since 2011. Even then, diplomats told her she was on her own. So she sits tight in the warren of concrete apartment blocks, listens for rockets, mortars and MiGs and worries about her children and their future.
