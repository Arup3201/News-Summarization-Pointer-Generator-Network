This stunt takes the concept of speed dating to a whole new level.

Car maker Ford recruited a professional female driver to take several unsuspecting men on blind dates at a coffee shop in Dallas, Texas, and offer them a lift home in her 2015 Mustang GT.

Secretly filmed footage show her playing a 'dumb blonde' before getting out into an empty parking lot and showing what she can do. A look of deep concentration suddenly washes over her.

The men are lost for words as they're flung back in their seats at speeds of up to 120mph.
