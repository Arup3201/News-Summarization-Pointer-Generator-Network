Neglect: Mother-of-two Samantha Snow was found drunk in the street on her way to get more alcohol while her six-month old daughter was home alone

A mother who left her six-month-old child at home while she was so drunk she fell over and tipped her 18-month-old toddler out of his pram has been spared jail.

Samantha Snow, 33, toppled over in St Austell, Cornwall, as she went to buy more alcohol on New Year's Eve.

People went to help her and realising she was drunk contacted police.

She admitted to officers that her daughter was home alone, a court heard.

Police went to Snow's home and found the 
child lying on her back in the sitting room in a soaking wet nappy.

They also found empty bottles of alcohol and medication in the house.

A witness said Snow was ‘clearly heavily in drink’ when she fell and said her son was wet, crying and distressed when he was found face down on the ground.

Snow shouted ‘my baby, my baby’ as the witness stepped in to help and police were called.

Snow admitted assaulting, ill treating or neglecting two children in a manner likely to cause them unnecessary suffering or injury to their health at Bodmin Magistrates' Court yesterday.

In a statement read to the court, Snow’s aunt said she had suffered with depression since the death of her mother and had even hidden bottles of alcohol under her baby’s cot mattress.

Defence Snow, Paul Burley said: 'This was not a case of cruelty - it was a one off. This was an isolated incident, the very low point of what was going on. It is not something the children were open to constantly.'

Snow was handed a 26-week suspended jail sentence and ordered to pay £165 in costs.

Magistrate Geoff Cole said: 'This is obviously an extremely serious offence against two young children who were dependent on their mother looking after them.'
