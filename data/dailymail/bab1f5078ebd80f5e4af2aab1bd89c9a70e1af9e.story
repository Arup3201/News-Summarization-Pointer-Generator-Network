 Marrakesh for round two of their celebrations, to which the source 
said: 'Michelle is definitely coming and heaps of others too, it's going
 to be stunning.'

 Michelle have only been together since January, they are have toured

The pair appeared quite worse for wear during the game as they drank, kissed cuddled and blew smoke rings.

They
 were soon reunited in Paris a few weeks later where Cara was modelling 
for Fashion Week, before spending time together in the model's native 
London.

were said to have been introduced by mutual friend, pop star Rihanna, at
 a party in New York last October and immediately hit it off. 

In
 an interview in February, Michelle admitted the pair were a couple: 
'It’s going really well. She’s so cool. When we started hanging out I 
just thought she was awesome, and we have the best time together. She’s 
hard though. You wouldn’t want to mess with her in a fight.'

Michelle spoke openly about her sexuality six months ago in an interview with Entertainment Weekly.

She
 said: 'I've never walked the carpet with anyone, so they wonder: "What 
does she do with her vagina?" Plus, I play a butchy girl all the time, 
so they assume I'm a lesbo...

'They're not too far off. I've gone 
both ways. I do as I please. I am too f**king curios to sit here and not
 try when I can. Men are intriguing. So are chicks.'

Meanwhile, Cara once tweeted she 'played for more than one team'.

In the past two years, Cara has previously been romantically linked to One Direction's Harry Styles and musician Jake Bugg.
