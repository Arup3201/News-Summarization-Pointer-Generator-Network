'Very immature': Court dock officer Yasemin Ozyukselen (pictured) has been jailed for ten months after sharing flirty phone calls with a convicted rapist serving at one of Britain's most notorious prisons

A dock officer who shared flirty phone calls with a serving inmate at one of Britain's most notorious prisons was jailed for 10 months today.

Serco worker Yasemin Ozyukselen, 24, was contacted almost 60 times by convicted rapist Shahed Ahmed, 22, while he was held at HMP Belmarsh in Woolwich, southeast London.

Ahmed bombarded Ozyukselen with calls over a 15-month period in which he called her 'darling', 'gorgeous', 'princess' and 'baby'.

He also described her as 'sexy' and they had a discussion about hairstyles, Southwark Crown Court heard.

She responded by agreeing to meet him on his release, when he promised he would take her out and 'spoil' her.

Ahmed also contacted Ozyukselen's sister during their illicit relationship, between March 29, 2011 and June 29, 2012.

She also engaged in inappropriate mobile phone contact with three other prisoners at HMP Pentonville in north London and other jails between November 14, 2011 and January 23, 2012.

One of the prisoners had her number stored as 'Sexy Eyes', while another also phoned her sister.

Ozyukselen claimed she was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after a prisoner attempted to escape from a van, leaving her with facial injuries and bruising.

She also suffered long-lasting psychological effects, her lawyer claimed.

But Judge Andrew Goymer told her: 'You must have known, and I find it impossible to accept that you didn't, that officers such as you must not have personal relationships with prisoners and the reasons for this are obvious.

'These relationships have a corrupting effect on officers, they warp their judgement, they lead them to do things that are in breach of their duties and it puts them and other officers at the risk of being blackmailed.

'You must have known exactly what you were doing and the harm that it would cause.

'The relationship with Shahed Ahmed did not become sexual but it was a relationship of rather close emotional involvement that was quite inappropriate.

'I find it completely incomprehensible why you should engage in this sort of behaviour. These offences are so serious I cannot avoid imposing a prison sentence on you for them.'

Sporting a 'Croydon facelift' with her hair scraped back into a bun, and wearing a black coat and stripy top, Ozyukselen bit her nails throughout the hearing.

She sobbed as the sentence was passed and called out to her mother, who wept in the public gallery as her daughter was led out of the dock.

Prosecutor Tetteh Turkson told the court: 'The defendant was employed by Serco as an officer and started her employment transporting prisoners to court and latterly she was involved in being a dock officer and security officer.

'She was in possession on her arrest of two mobile phones.

'These phones showed her to have made contact illicitly with phones held at HMP Pentonville and landlines at HMP Belmarsh.'

Ahmed listed her on a 'controlled prison number list' to allow inmates to keep in touch with friends and family, Mr Turkson said.

'He made a call on March 30, 2012, 
referring to her as darling, gorgeous, princess and baby. She agreed to 
meet him when he gets out and he said he would take her out and spoil 
her.

'On April 6, he called her and said she was sexy and they had a discussion about hairstyles.

'She was arrested on June 27, 2012 at Barkingside Magistrates' Court when she had the two mobile phones in her possession.'

In interview, Ozyukselen insisted she didn't know Ahmed and denied having any contact with him.

She later claimed a 'crazy person' was contacting her but admitted she had not told her superiors.

Michael Cogan, mitigating for Ozyukselen, told the court she 'succumbed to the charm' of prisoners and didn't appreciate the trouble her crimes had caused.

'It is abundantly clear she is very, very immature. There is no suggestion she supplied the mobile phones or brought on any form of contraband into the prison.

'If there was such an offence of gross stupidity, this defendant would be guilty of that. But she is not a dishonest person, she is just vulnerable and immature.'

Ozyukselen, from Dagenham, east London, admitted two counts of misconduct in a public office.

A third charge of misconduct in a public office was left on the court file.
