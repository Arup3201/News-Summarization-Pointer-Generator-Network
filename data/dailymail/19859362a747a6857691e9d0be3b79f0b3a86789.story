Alex the Golden Retriever isn't shy about showing off his b-boy moves.

Performing for the camera, Alex is seen obeying the instruction to sit up from his owner and is then told to dance.

He puts his paws together and bounces them up and down in the air to the sound of an encouraging: 'Good boy buddy!'

Alex then begins to spin, turning the kitchen floor in his own dance floor

Clearly thrilled with the response, Alex then gears himself up for what his owner calls 'his grand finale', seen in the video posted online by Petsami.

The voiceover suggests that Alex is cutting his routine short to get to the finish, so perhaps he was feeling particularly eager for a reward - or even a little embarrassed by his owner wanting to show him off.

The Golden Retriever spins on the spot by putting three paws together and using his left hind leg to propel himself around in a circle.

After a couple of spins, Alex relaxes on the ground and chews on his foot instead.Â

Alex's owner is heard saying that the Goldren Retriever taught himself to pull off these moves

The owner is heard saying: 'Believe it or not, we did never teach him this.

'He did this on his own and we are highly embarrassed. People think it's so funny.'

But there's no reason to be embarrassed when your dog has moves like Alex.
