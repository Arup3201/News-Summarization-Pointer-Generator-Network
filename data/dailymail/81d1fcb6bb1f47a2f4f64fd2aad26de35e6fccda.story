Sportsmail columnist Martin Keown has picked his #one2eleven of stars he  played alongside throughout his career, on The Fantasy Football Club on Sky Sports.

It is little surprise the former Arsenal defender has chosen 11 players that once donned the red of the Gunners, but who makes his best line-up? 

Watch #one2eleven every Friday evening on The Fantasy Football Club, Sky Sports 1 or catch up On Demand.

GOALKEEPER: DAVID SEAMAN

David Seaman has to be my No 1 goalkeeper. I'd come from Everton with Neville Southall. You couldn't look at Neville because if you looked at him he'd blame you if the ball was in the back of the net. But David was the complete opposite. David had really sort of soft hands. He was able to take the sting out of a shot. We had a decent defence but it was nothing without David in goal.

RIGHT BACK: LEE DIXON

If I'm having to pick one, it has to be Lee Dixon. He was sort of my eyes and ears. He was almost part of my own body. I never had to look to my right because Lee was telling me everything that was going on.

DEFENDER: TONY ADAMS

First bumped into him at the age of 13. Cockney lad, swaggering into the room. I was a little bit of a country bumpkin. We kind of set up a partnership in the youth team. I knew him inside out. I knew his strengths, I knew his weaknesses. He has to get into that team. There's no doubt about it.

DEFENDER: SOL CAMPBELL

He turned up at Arsenal around all that publicity and expectation. It was on a train that didn't get out of the station to start with. Wenger stuck with him. Eventually once that train got going, it was unstoppable. It was a real force. He's quick, strong, could see danger. Once he was focussed, he was as good as anyone.

LEFT BACK: ASHLEY COLE

Straight away I could see that this kid was going to be a bit special. Ashley would park himself around the senior players. He would listen in, he was a very, very quick learner. A real winner. Just disappointed he had to leave Arsenal early.

RIGHT WING: ROBERT PIRES

Just on another planet. The goal that stands out was at Villa Park when he knocks it over Peter Schmeichel. He'd just embarrassed a top keeper. He was just capable of that. You've got to look at what you see in training behind the scenes, and Robert Pires had people applauding the stuff he was capable of.

MIDFIELDER: PATRICK VIEIRA

He was the catalyst for all the success that was to come. Without Patrick there wouldn't have been any of these trophies. I can tell you that. He pretended he couldn't speak English at the start, then everyone was talking about him, and I think he grabbed someone by the throat in the dressing room. It showed he had some fight about him. As it unfolded I became his minder. I think people could see he could react a bit and we needed him on the pitch. Absolute top talent. Still to this day he's the same person that walked through the door that very first day at Arsenal.

MIDFIELDER: EMMANUEL PETIT

It was a competition between him and Patrick Vieira who was going to be man of the match. Game after game. He was a warrior that could play with that finesse and gave us that buffer whenever we had to defend. Those two in front made our lives very easy.

LEFT WING: MARC OVERMARS

You've got to ask Gary Neville how pleased was he to see him leave. He was so quick that it was almost as if someone had picked him up and put him there. You didn't see him travel. He put fear into teams. You could just see people backing off giving him space to play in.

STRIKER: DENNIS BERGKAMP

His ability. The way he could bend balls around players. Pace as well. Once he got away from you in training - I was no slouch - and you wouldn't catch him. Slow start when he came. I think he was a little bit unsure of the situation he found himself in. Again we weren't really ready. To play with Dennis was a joy. I remember Ian Wright skipping down the marble halls at Highbury when he heard Dennis was coming, because he knew that meant goals.

STRIKER: THIERRY HENRY

He had that sort of textbook finish. He was more basic in his finishing. His pace. His power. You've never seen anything like it. This was a top athlete without spikes, he had football boots instead. Unbelievable. I gave him a hard time when he came, as I did with all the strikers. He had that swagger as he does now even in front of the camera. He was turning to the rest of the team: 'You better be able to stick with me.' Whereas at the start we were demanding he came with us. Those two together was an absolute nightmare and I used to giggle when I'd see them in action because I had to train against them.
