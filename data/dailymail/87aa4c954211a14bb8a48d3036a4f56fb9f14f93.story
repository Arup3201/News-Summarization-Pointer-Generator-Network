Rare and beautiful shots of alien-looking moon jellyfish have been captured by an Israeli photographer in the Red Sea.

Photographer Yuzuru Masuda, 37, captured these stunning images of the moon jellyfish as he snorkelled during an excursion off the coast of Saudi Arabia. 

Masuda watched and swam with the jellyfish for two hours and because they don't sting he could let them swim right up to him and even brush against his arm.

The official name of the moon jellyfish is aurelia aurita.

It is also known as the moon jelly, common jellyfish, or saucer jelly.

All the species in the aurealia genus look and swim so similarly that it's difficult to identify related, and it is difficult to identify which is which with taking gene samples. 

The moon jellyfish grows to about 40cm in diameter.

It eats plankton and molluscs with its tentacles and brings them into their bodies to be digested.  

It can only make small, limited movements so usually drifts with the current, even when swimming.

It can't sting and is often attacked by sea birds, sea turtles and the Ocean Sunfish.

Mr Masuda, from Eliat, Israel, said: 'I was snorkelling on my own near the border to Egypt when countless jellyfish drifted in.

I knew this species didn't sting so I was not scared but mesmerised by their slow and graceful pulsating movement.

'To the naked eye underwater, the jellyfish appear a little more pink 
and the very soft and diffused transparent colour really makes them look
like fairies.'

The jellyfish, which measured 20 - 25 centimetres in diameter, can swim 
by pulsating their tentacles but were also carried along by the current.

Mr Masuda added: 'The jellyfish look like they are individual cells with
their own subconscious intelligence to guide through drifting life 
style.

'I also learned they provide shelter for juvenile fish that also got drifted by the current, which I thought was sweet.

'I was very close and swam among many of the jellyfish and they would contact my arms or legs even without trying.

'As long as I found individuals with beautiful shapes I continued to 
shoot, because I did not have a time limit I would have had if I had 
been scuba diving.

'I surfaced when my body could not stop shivering underwater from staying in cold water without proper wetsuit.

'The many jellyfish drifted off but also many new jellyfish kept coming.'

Mr Masuda also saw many colourful fish, blue spotted stingrays, Moray eels, octopuses, squid, lionfish, barracudas and turtles.

The moon jellyfish is translucent and grows to about 40 cm in diameter. It can be identified by its four horseshoe-shaped gonads (pictured), seen through the top of the bell. This image was captured by photographer Yuzuru Masuda in the Red Sea

The moon jellyfish doesn't sting. This means it is often attacked by sea birds and sea turtles. It is part of the aurelia genus of jellyfish that lives along the eastern Atlantic coast of Northern Europe and the western Atlantic coast of North America in New England and Eastern Canada. It is usually found in estuaries and harbours
