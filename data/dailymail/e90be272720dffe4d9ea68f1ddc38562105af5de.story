A firefighter is believed to have suffered burns to up to 70 per cent of his body after he scaled a roof of a burning garage in California and fell through the structure, then being engulfed by a large fireball

Crews were called to the blaze in Fresno on Sunday afternoon. 

The firefighter climbed onto the roof of the one storey at about 1.30pm to try and control the flames, which officials confirmed was standard operating procedure.

In video footage captured by bystander Sooji Lee, he is seen edging across the roof among vast plumes of smoke to try and ventilate the fire.

The roof then appears to disappear from under him and the firefighter falls through, and is engulfed by large flames.

Screams from people standing nearby can be heard on the video. 

Firefighters then removed the front of the house in just minutes to get the fireman from the house and douse him in cold water. 

The firefighter had been trying to ventilate the building as he scaled the roof before falling through it 

He was then taken to Community Regional Medical Center.

Fresno Fire Chief Kerri Downs, said: 'I believe he suffered burns on his hands and around his face, as well as other burns on his back and his face. They were pretty much all around his body.' 

The firefighter, who is married and has a daughter, is believed to have suffered between 60 and 70 per cent burns. 

Battalion Chief Todd Tuggle said hearing the screams from bystanders was harrowing. He said: 'We could hear people screaming and we could hear people trying to help.'  

After the fireman fell through the roof a large fireball emerged from the building, engulfing him in the flames 

Dozens of crew members have turned up at the hospital to offer their support. 

'There's no doubt in my mind that individual trained most of us here,'  Fresno Firefighters Local 753 President Pete Flores, told the Fresno Bee. 

'I've trained with him as well. There's a lot of experience and knowledge, so to see someone like that suffer these injuries is pretty detrimental to our family.'

Joe Reyes, a former Marine, was driving past at the time of the accident and helped clear trashcans and used an axe to hack into the garage to help firefighters rescue the man.

A total of 11 trucks and 31 firefighters were called to battle the blaze on Sunday afternoon.

Investigators are examining how the fire started and if the fall could have been prevented.
