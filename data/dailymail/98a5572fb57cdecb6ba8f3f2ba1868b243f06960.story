She was the blonde event sales manager at a football club who jokingly posed with the slogan ‘sex bomb’.

He was the team’s strapping star striker and captain.

But when rumours of a fling between Joanne Clay and Marc Richards began to circulate, the club decided there could be only one result.

Despite denying they had an affair, Miss Clay was sacked by League One side Port Vale. Richards faced no action, even though she claimed he had tried to seduce her.

'Too attractive': Joanne Clay said that when then Port Vale chief executive Perry Deakin questioned her about the rumours of an affair with Richards, he told her: ‘Your problem is that you are too attractive to work in football'

Miss Clay, 33, said the club had a strict rule that female staff must not have relationships with players and she was told by bosses she was ‘too attractive to work in football’.

Now she is in line for a payout of tens of thousands of pounds after winning her sex discrimination case against the club and a claim for sexual harassment. 

The employment tribunal ruled it was ‘striking’ that while she was suspended, investigated and then dismissed over the rumours, ‘no action whatsoever was taken’ against the player.

It also found that the Stoke-on-Trent club’s ban on relationships between employees and footballers was ‘a rule that is slanted against women’.

Miss Clay said Richards, 32, had pursued her after she joined the club in May 2011 but she had rejected his advances. 

The father-of-three, who has a long-term girlfriend, left repeated messages on her phone and on social media, wrote his phone number in dirt on her car, followed her to the bank and later visited her at home after persuading her to give him her address, she told the tribunal.

Miss Clay, a mother-of-five who was married at the time, said she was the target of frequent crude sexual comments by the club’s sales manager Chris Bedding. 

He called her a ‘bitch’, teased her about her rumoured affair with Richards, pestered her to date him and demanded that she wear low-cut tops, she said.

After she was sacked in October 2011, Mr Bedding asked a colleague to get photographs from the team that he claimed showed her having sex with Richards, the tribunal heard.

Miss Clay claimed that at one work dinner Mr Bedding told a waitress to announce her as ‘Joanne Richards’.

She said that Mr Bedding had numerous sexual relationships with barmaids and waitresses at the club, but no disciplinary action resulted.

Mr Bedding, who has since left the club, denied this – but an unnamed female sales executive said that he made ‘disgusting’ sexual comments both to her and to Miss Clay.

Miss Clay, who is pictured on Facebook holding signs saying ‘sex bomb’ and ‘no chance’ at a hen party, said that when then Port Vale chief executive Perry Deakin questioned her about the rumours of an affair with Richards, he told her: ‘Your problem is that you are too attractive to work in football.’

The tribunal accepted Mr Deakin’s denial that he made the comment.

But it found Port Vale and Azure Support Services Ltd, the company through which Miss Clay was employed, guilty of sex discrimination in relation to her dismissal and her harassment by Mr Bedding. 

The panel said a man would not have been treated in the same way. Miss Clay’s compensation will be set at hearing in March.

Richards, who played for Port Vale between 2007 and 2012, is now with Northampton Town. He lives with his partner of 12 years, Melanie Gaye, 31, and their three children.

Miss Clay, from Stoke-on-Trent, is believed to have divorced her husband James Vernon, 35 – a coach for local rivals Stoke City – last year.

She lives with a new partner and runs a wedding planning and bridal wear business in Newcastle-under-Lyme. She did not wish to comment further. Richards was unavailable to comment and Port Vale declined to respond.
