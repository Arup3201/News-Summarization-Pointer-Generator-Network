Amanda Holden sacked her closest aide in a fit of fury after a picture of her nine-year-old daughter apparently dressed as the prostitute from Pretty Woman emerged online, it was claimed today.

The Britain's Got Talent star was allegedly terrified that the photograph - which the 44-year-old wanted erased from the internet - would damage her career and blamed her adviser of 20 years.

A picture of Lexi in a strapless red dress was posted on her official Twitter account on February 13 with the caption: '1990's day at Lexi's school today. Julia Roberts "Pretty Woman".'

Ms Holden then blamed her husband Chris Hughes for the publishing the picture and denied the schoolgirl was dressing as fictional prostitute Vivian.

Row: Amanda Holden sacked an aide after a picture of her  eldest daughter Lexi with the caption: '1990's day at Lexi's school today. Julia Roberts "Pretty Woman" was posted on Twitter by her hsuband

The inspiration: Amanda's daughter wore a similar outfit to that of Julia Roberts' character Vivian but Amanda later denied this was what she was aping 

Ms Holden was apparently worried about what the picture might do for her career because she will be leaving Britain's Got Talent and is looking for new opportunities.

She reportedly blamed her aide of 20 years for her handling of the situation after the photograph was published, and is now being represented by One Direction's team.

A source told The Sun: 'As far as Amanda is concerned, this slip-up came at exactly the wrong time and she is really worried it will affect her career.

'When Amanda realised how bad the fall-out was, she was absolutely furious and since then, she and her aide — who she has been with for years — have not been working together.

'She blamed her for not handling the situation properly'. 

When the picture was released Ms Holden  threatened media outlets with legal action in an attempt to erase it from the internet.

Her aide reportedly infuriated her by referring her to her lawyer who said: 'Once the photo was out there, it was out'. 

Outrage: Amanda Holden received complaints on Twitter after she posted a picture of her nine-year-old daughter Lexi apparently dressed up as fictional prostitute from  Pretty Woman for a school fancy dress day

She blamed the tweet on her husband Chris Hughes (pictured together) 'pressing the wrong button'

The post was removed after just eight minutes after it was roundly criticised by fellow Twitter users as being inappropriate as the actress plays a prostitute in the film.

Amanda Holden's spokesman said: 'This story is untrue. Amanda’s change in PR agencies has nothing to do with any fears over her career, but solely due to her being so devastated that a recent story involving her daughter went out of control and sick comments were being made towards her nine-year-old. 

'She felt that the situation was underestimated and not properly handled resulting in Amanda having to take legal action to ensure her child’s safety'. 

After the image was republished on numerous websites and in national newspapers, the Britain's Got Talent judge demanded that the media cease using the picture on the grounds that she owns the copyright.

Despite the fact that it was publicly posted on her Twitter account, MailOnline agreed to remove the image, as have several other media outlets.

Amid a mounting backlash over the picture, Holden released a statement insisting she was dressed as Cindy Crawford. And she put the misunderstanding down to a mistake from her husband, Chris Hughes, who hit the wrong button. 

In a statement she said: 'The truth is that Lexi went to school as Cindy Crawford for her school '90s Day - not Julia Roberts - as anyone who heard me yesterday at BGT - and indeed the teachers at Lexi's school - will confirm.

Under fire: It wasn't long until followers reacted to her image on Twitter, which led to it being pulled down

'However my husband thought she looked more like Julia Roberts, without any thought to any interpretation.

Amanda Holden released a statement today which said: 'The truth is that Lexi went to school as Cindy Crawford for her school '90s Day - not Julia Roberts - as anyone who heard me yesterday at BGT - and indeed the teachers at Lexi's school - will confirm.

'However my husband thought she looked more like Julia Roberts, without any thought to any interpretation. Although given that she is a nine year old girl it seems completely unbelievable and disturbing that anyone could or would put such an interpretation on it.

'Julia Roberts, is one of the most beautiful and iconic women in the world and so, as a proud father, he wanted to post the similarity on his own private Facebook account. He hit the wrong button and posted it on my twitter account- but removed it as soon as he realised. The first I knew about it as I was contacted by the media whilst filming today. Needless to say my husband is mortified.

'And just as an aside, on the school run this morning we bumped into 'Mia Wallace' from Pulp Fiction and 'Mr Pink' from Reservoir dogs!'

'Although given that she is a nine-year old girl it seems completely unbelievable and disturbing that anyone could or would put such an interpretation on it.

'He hit the wrong button and posted it on my Twitter account- but removed it as soon as he realised.

'The first I knew was when I was contacted by the media while filming today. My husband is mortified.' 

Within minutes of uploading the picture, the TV personality had received many outraged comments from her followers.

In the picture, the little girl is dressed in a red, strapless gown, imitating Julia Roberts' famous on-screen character in the 1990 movie.

She posed next to a piano and looked down at her feet in the photo, which showed her fancy dress costume for school.

Holden, a 43-year-old mother-of-two who is married to record producer Mr Hughes, deleted the image from her timeline after eight minutes.

Fans were quick to criticise her choice of clothing for her daughter, with many branding her irresponsible.

One Twitter user wrote: 'Amanda Holden dressed her daughter up as Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman? A woman who had sex with an old man to get money and nice things. 

Another pointed out the amount of time it took for the TV presenter and actress to remove the picture of her daughter from her Twitter page.

'Eight minutes it took @Amanda_Holden to realise she'd dressed up her daughter as a hooker. Eight WHOLE minutes.'

'Totally inappropriate.wrong on so many levels,' one incensed person wrote.
