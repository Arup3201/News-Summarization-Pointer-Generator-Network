Giorgio Armani has swapped clothes for interiors, creating swanky dream homes in one of the world's most exclusive apartment blocks - in the booming Indian city of Mumbai.

The apartments, which are being sold by Wetherall Estates, which specialises in £50million Mayfair mansions, has signed a deal to sell the flats, with prices starting at £1.4million each.

When complete next year, the luxury 1,450ft World One Tower will be the tallest residential building in the world.

The apartments' interiors will combine the 'Armani philosophy' with the 'magnificent textile legacy of India'

Rooms have colour schemes of taupe, chocolate, grey, and cream in apartments with £1.4million price tags

It is being built by the Lodha group which is targeting super-rich Indians living in the UK.

It will include 300 high-end apartments and penthouses and occupants will reach their floors in lifts only a little slower than an Olympic sprinter.

The Giorgio Armani-designed interiors will boast comfort cooling, state-of-the-art home entertainment and security and electronic windows, curtains and blinds.

The three and four-bedroom apartments on the upper floors wil have views over Mumbai and the Arabian Sea.

The skyscraper also has a large indoor leisure complex with indoor swimming pools, gymnasium and spa.

Each apartment will have a generously sized reception room, kitchen/breakfast room, luxurious bedroom suites and beautifully appointed bathrooms.

The flats are being sold by Mayfair-based Wetherell Estates which wants to tempt rich Indians living in London to snap up one of the properties in the 117-storey tower, which is due for completion next year

Wetherell Estates, in Mayfair, now has the job of tempting Indians living in London to look at buying a home in the 117-storey World One Tower, which is scheduled to be finished next year.

The estate agency has been chosen because Indians currently account for 25 per cent of homebuyers in Mayfair. Only Brits buy more property in the luxury London 'village'.

Indian families and developers have spent around £1billion on homes and business projects in Mayfair and the West End in the past 18 months alone.

It is estimated around 3,000 rich families escape the heat of India each summer and spend their time in Mayfair instead.

They typically spend between £1 and £20 million on homes, with 70 per cent spent on flats and apartments.

The website for World One describes the look of each of the flats: 'The Armani/Casa Interior Design Studio creates living experiences rooted in the Armani philosophy – yet evoking all the colour, vibrancy, energy and magnificent textile legacy of India.

'Working under the personal supervision of Giorgio Armani, the Armani/Casa Interior Design Studio team will translate his vision within India`s unique culture and ethos.'

The 300 high-end apartments and penthouses in the swanky block of flats will be accessed by super-fast lifts

The 1,450ft World One Tower is being built by the Lodha Group in the Worli district of South Mumbai

It describes the signature Armani residences as 'harmonious' and each home, 'exudes the perfect simplicity, sensitivity, sophistication and flair that is quintessentially Armani.' 

Peter Wetherell, chief executive of Wetherell, said: 'The British and international-based Indian business community are extremely successful and have been major investors in prime London real estate over the last two years.

'Now Wetherell aims to tap into this market and generate some reverse marketing and sales, in order to channel some of this wealth back to India and into the luxurious residences in the World One Tower.

'Indian buyers in London are used to homes with an extremely high specification and hotel style amenities.

'Lodha Group have been extremely clever in providing the World One Tower with every luxury and leisure amenity imaginable, and the Armani Casa brand and interiors clearly demonstrates that this is an international product of a standard that can rival London, Milan and other luxury destinations.'

World One Tower was designed by international architects Pei Cobb Freed & Partners and is located in the Worli district of South Mumbai, overlooking the Arabian Sea.

Worli is a leafy downtown suburb where, during the days of the Raj, the British administrators had their luxury villas and bungalows.

The tower will leapfrog 432 Park Avenue in New York which at 1,398-feet high is currently the world's tallest residential tower.

The building, with its interiors that wouldn't be out of place in a five star hotel, will be taller than the current highest residential tower, 432 Park Avenue in New York, which is 1,398 feet tall

Wetherell's chief executive said potential buyers are used to 'high specification and hotel style amenities'.
