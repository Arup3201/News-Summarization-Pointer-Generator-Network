A New York City woman was glad to be alive Wednesday after managing to walk away with just minor cuts when a jackhammer chisel flew through a gym window and struck her as she exercised.

Robin Cocking, 59, was working out at Manhattan's Asphalt Green when the 10-pound metal bit crashed through two panes of glass and cut her as she lay shocked on a gym mat.

The shocking freak accident now has residents in the area fuming now that the source of the bit has been traced next door, to the construction site of a controversial garbage depot next door to the Upper East Side rec center.

Shocker: Robin Cocking was exercising at the Asphalt Green in Manhattan Wednesday when a 10-pound jackhammer chisel smashed through the window and nearly impaled her

Dangerous: The huge metal spike left a spattering of shattered glass across the floor of Asphalt Green where Cocking was exercising

'I saw this thing come through the glass. I thought: if it’s breaking the glass it has to be heavy metal, and sharp,' Cocking, a database administrator at Asphalt Green, told the New York Post.

When Cocking heard the glass shatter, she had the fast foresight to move out of the way.

'Thank God she rolled left, because the jackhammer chisel landed right where she was and would have impaled her,' said Kelly-Mimmo-Guengher, who works with Pledge 2 Protect community group, which exists in opposition to the East 91st Street Marine Transfer Station.

The Marine Transfer Station was proposed by then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg in 2006 as part of a move to make Manhattan more responsible for its own trash.

Critics have said from the beginning that the station is a poor fit for the largely residential area.

Powerful: Two panes of safety glass were shattered, leaving employees to believe the chisel had shot through at seriously high velocity

'Of course this happened,' Asphalt Green 
director Carol Tweedy told the New York Daily News. 'We have been saying
 for years, this is not the right site for an industrial facility. There
 are 34,000 children who use Asphalt Green every year.'

Tweedy claims she and other asphalt green officials have documented several safety issues with the nearby construction site.

Cocking was lucky to get away with only a few cuts.

'I only suffered minor cuts on my right hand, right foot and on my left arm,' she told DNAinfo. 'My hands are still shaking. I think I'm still shocked.'

The city temporarily shut down all work at the construction site while they did an investigation.

'We'll continue to maintain our vigilance at all construction sites through random safety audits,' spokesman Joe Soldevere said.

'I saw this thing come through the glass. I thought: if it¿s breaking the glass it has to be heavy metal, and sharp,' said Cocking, a database administrator at Asphalt Green, seen here receiving first aid

'I only suffered minor cuts on my right hand, right foot and on my left arm,' Cocking said. 'My hands are still shaking. I think I'm still shocked'
