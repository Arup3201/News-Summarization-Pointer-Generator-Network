David Cameron's former spin doctor Andy Coulson appeared in court today to face charges over an alleged conspiracy to bribe public officials for information.

Coulson, 45, is accused with ex-News of the World (NOTW) royal correspondent Clive Goodman of requesting and authorising payments to public officials in exchange for information, including a royal phone directory known as the 'Green Book'.

It is alleged to have taken place while Coulson was editor of the defunct Sunday tabloid.

Meanwhile former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks, 44, also appeared at the Old Bailey to face charges 
in relation to a separate case.
