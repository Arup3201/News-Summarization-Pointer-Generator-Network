Two U.S. Army recruiters are facing charges of unlawful sex with a minor after, police say, the two had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old they met while recruiting at a Florida high school.

Christopher Glenn Doner, 30, and John Back, 33, reportedly met the girl earlier this year while recruiting at Harmony High School, the Orlando Sentinel reports.

The two had both been in sexual relationships with the girl for several months, at the same time, and both asked her to stop seeing the other one but she did not, Twis Lizasuain, sheriff's spokeswoman, told the newspaper.

Both men are married with children. 

Doner and Back frequently visited high schools to recruit students to join the military. Neither are permitted to recruit anymore.

The victim's mother contacted authorities after she found text messages on the 17-year-old's phone from the two army recruiters, according to FOX Orlando.

Investigators say the sexual encounters never occurred on the school's campus, but occurred in a home, a hotel, and in the teen's car, FOX reports. The victim reportedly told investigators the relationship was consensual. 

Doner was questioned by authorities in November and admitted that his relationship with the teen was wrong and said he would end it, according to WKMG. Doner was arrested Tuesday and charged with 10 counts of unlawful sex with a minor; he posted bail  and was released Wednesday.

Detectives are working with investigators in Michigan to track down Back who relocated earlier this week. 

Back will face two counts of unlawful sex with a minor and will be extradited to Florida because of the felony warrant, WKMG reports. Back is aware of the charges.
