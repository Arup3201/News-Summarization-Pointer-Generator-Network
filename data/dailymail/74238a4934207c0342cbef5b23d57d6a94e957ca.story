The Indian Prime Minister made a bold fashion choice to greet President Obama, arriving in a suit with his own name repeatedly sewn into it.

Narendra Modi gave Michelle Obama some stiff competition, in a dark suit with gold pinstripes and a check pocket square for talks with the president yesterday.

But the stripes on the fitted wool jacket and trousers Mr Modi wore were not actually stripes at all - and close-up photographs revealed the words 'Narendra Damodardas Modi' had been embroidered on his outfit.

Damodardas was Mr Modi's father, a tea seller in western Indian state of Gujarat.

Fans of Mr Modi on Twitter loved the look, but political
opponents jumped at the chance to hit back at the prime
minister.

'The levels of megalomania and narcissism are
unparalleled,' said Shehzad Poonawalla, a supporter of the main opposition party, Congress.

'It reveals a lot about the mindset of the man.'

The Gujarat state-based designer, who asked not to be named, has worked closely on designing Mr Modi's wardrobe since 2001.

He said: 'We were told that he had loved it because it was something
exclusive.'

Obama's three-day visit to New Delhi has already yielded
plans to unlock billions of dollars in nuclear trade and to
deepen defence ties, steps the world's two largest democracies
hope will establish an enduring strategic partnership.

India's leader has long been known for his flair for
fashion, often sporting short-sleeved versions of the kurta, the
Indian knee-length loose shirt.

The look has become so popular that the 'Modi Kurta' has
become its own label in India.

Obama also praised Mr Modi's fashion sense at a state dinner held on
Sunday in New Delhi, comparing it to his wife's elegance.

'So he's tough. And he also has style,' he said.

'One of our newspapers back home wrote, 'Move aside,
Michelle Obama.  The world has a new fashion icon.''
