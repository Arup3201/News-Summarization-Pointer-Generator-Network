The playboys are back in town and they're causing havoc again with their uninsured supercars and unruly driving.

During Ramadan the millionaire boy racers had a limited respite from revving their Lamborghinis and Ferraris around London's exclusive Knightsbridge.

But as the fasting season ends, the cars have once again returned to the neighbourhood.

Unlucky: The owner of this Lamborghini Aventador watched helplessly as his uninsured £300,000 supercar was taken away

The owner of this Dubai-registered Lamborghini Aventador fell foul of the law yesterday when he was found to be driving the £300,000 supercar without the correct insurance.

Officers from the Met Police swooped on the 217mph super car in Brompton Road, near Harrods, and called for a low loader.

The owner of the Lamborghini, who bought the supercar from a man on the street in June, had to watch helplessly as it was carried away while dozens of onlookers photographed the embarrassing spectacle. 

It will now be held in a Met Police compound until the owner can prove he is legally allowed to drive it in the UK.

The removal of the Lamborghini means there is one less supercar causing problems for locals and authorities.

Panda Morgan-Thomas is one of a number of furious locals who are having their lives blighted by the youngsters in their supercars.

Residents of Knightsbridge, which has an average house price of £3.6million, say the drivers from the Gulf region are ‘a manifestation of too much-ness’.

The petrol-heads and their motors are cheered on by camera-carrying youngsters, known as the Carparrazzi, but are hated by a number of furious residents who claim their lives are being ruined.

She said: 'These are beautifully engineered cars so why on earth would the drivers want to circle around shopping streets at 10mph? Lewis Hamilton doesn't need to.

'Night time racing is the real problem for residents however and has continued to increase this year.

'The noise is horrific at 4am. The police have promised to crack down on illegal activities - we'll see.'

A number of super car owners have had their vehicles seized by police officers including a member of Qatar's Al-Thani dynasty who had two models taken off the road.

Last week a car worth more than the average UK house price was pulled over by police before being towed away.

Off to the pound: Police say the luxury car is not the first Lamborghini Aventador they have seized

The driver of the £270,000 
Lamborghini Aventador was asked to stop in London's Knightsbridge last 
night by officers wanting to see his papers.

After the man was unable to produce 
documents that satisfied them the supercar was properly insured, he then
had to watch as it was loaded onto a tow truck and taken away.

A crowd gathered in Basil Street, 
just behind Harrods, to watch as the sports car, which boasts 
upwards-opening scissor doors, was taken away by police.

The car was seized as part of the Met
Police's Operation Cubo crackdown on uninsured vehicles.  So far more 
than 10,000 cars have been towed under Cubo, many of them old bangers.

A purple model was towed also from Knightsbridge last month after police found he was not 
properly insured.
