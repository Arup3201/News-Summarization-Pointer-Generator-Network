Four in ten children lack the basic skills needed to be ready for school at the age of five, new figures revealed yesterday.

More than 250,000 youngsters struggle with the demands of formal education after falling short of development targets in early reading, writing and physical skills.

Boys have fallen significantly behind girls by the age of five, with only 52 per cent considered to have reached a ‘good level of development’.

Girls are racing ahead in every area of early development measured by the Government, with 69 per cent judged to be ready to start formal schooling.

The figures – based on assessments of children at the end of their primary school reception year - prompted ministers to insist that nurseries and other carers ‘must do more’ to help toddlers learn.

Despite improvements in most parts of the country since last year, Childcare Minister Sam Gyimah insisted that ‘too few young children are ready for school’.

The figures show that just 59 per cent of boys can write a simple sentence or a letter to Father Christmas at the age of five against three-quarters of girls.

Just 68 per cent of boys can read simple sentences compared with 80 per cent of their female classmates.

Commenting on the figures, Mr Gyimah said: ‘We know the first few years of a child’s life can be make or break in terms of how well they go on to do at school and beyond.

‘The statistics published today clearly show that some progress is being made but more must be done to ensure children, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, are put on the right path.

‘Parents need to be confident that while their children are out of their care, they’re not only safe, happy and having fun but at the same time developing important skills like playing confidently with their friends, speaking and understanding words, letters and numbers.

‘The Government has provided new funding through the Early Years Pupil Premium and strengthened qualifications to raise standards. It’s now up to those who support our children to ensure they get the start in life they deserve – something parents and I both want to see.’

Under a ‘nappy curriculum’ for children aged from birth to five, teachers observe youngsters in their care and judge how well they are doing against 17 scales.

They are judged to have reached a ‘good level of development’ if they can show they are attentive in class, can follow detailed instructions, use tenses when speaking and show good control and co-ordination when making large and small movements.

They must also use the toilet and dress independently, be confident to try new activities, know that some behaviour is unacceptable and take turns with others when playing.

In literacy and numeracy, they should be able to read and write simple sentences, count to 20 and use everyday language to talk about size and weight.

The curriculum is meant to prepare youngsters to start compulsory schooling at age five and is followed by primary school reception classes, nurseries and childminders.

But some critics have claimed that formal learning is being imposed on children too soon.

There are particular concerns that the education system is failing to properly cater for boys, for example through shortages of male teachers.

Yesterday’s figures – from the Department for Education - show 60 per cent of five-year-olds were judged to have reached a ‘good’ levels of development this summer - up from 52 per cent last year.

It means some 258,000 youngsters will start Year One lacking some of the skills needed to cope with the demands of schooling.

While boys narrowed the gap slightly in some areas, they still lagged behind girls, particularly in reading and writing.

Professor Sir Michael Marmot, director of University College London’s Institute of Health Equity , said the quality of parenting and the amount of time adults spent interacting with children was critical to their development

The narrowest gap was in the use of technology, where 91 per cent of girls had a good level of understanding, against 89 per cent of boys.

Researchers from University College London’s Institute of Health Equity warned last month that too many children were being left damaged by early parenting which lacked cuddles and conversation.

Britain had some of the worst levels of development among children in the western world, it was claimed.

Professor Sir Michael Marmot, director of the institute, said the quality of parenting and the amount of time adults spent interacting with children was critical to their development.

‘Of course, some children will do better than others because it’s in their genes or things of that nature but we know the quality of parenting is crucial,’ he said.

‘We know input from parents or other carers on talking to children or reading to children, playing with children, singing with children and warmth - emotion, cuddling, loving - are all vital to children’s development.’

He said poor performance was also closely linked to levels of deprivation and the quality of services to support children and their parents before they start school.

Commenting on the latest figures, Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-School Learning Alliance, representing thousands of early years providers, said: ‘We are extremely disappointed that the minister has used these results, which show a marked improvement in outcomes across all areas of development, to direct unfair criticism at the early years sector.

‘Childcare professionals continue to do remarkable work in the face of inadequate funding and extremely limited practical support. Recent sector initiatives rolled-out by the Department for Education – such as the early years pupil premium – while positive in theory, will do little to address these challenges in practice, largely because the government refuses to acknowledge the severity of the current problem.’
