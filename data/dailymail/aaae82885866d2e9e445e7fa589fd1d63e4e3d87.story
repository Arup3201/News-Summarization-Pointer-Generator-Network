Father-of-three Stephen Fossey, 45, used his fruit and veg stall at Bacup market in Lancashire to illicitly lend money to up to 180 customers over four years

A market trader loan shark who boasted of interest rates  lower than Wonga and other legal payday loans firms has been ordered to pay back more than £100,000.

Stephen Fossey, 45, used his fruit and veg stall  at Bacup market in Lancashire to illicitly lend money to up to 180 customers over a four year period.

He typically charged between 25 and 30 per cent, which gives an annual rate of 1,355 per cent in comparison to legal online credit firms who have been known to charge up to 4,000 per cent annual interest on repayments.

Fossey, from Rossendale, Lancashire, was caught after investigators from the England Illegal Money Lending Team were tipped off by trading standards officers who were investigating a black market tobacco racket he was running.

It emerged the father of three had made a total of £325,473 over a period of four and a half years through the illegal money lending business so he could save up for pension.

His assets included three properties in the Lancashire area, bank balances and cash seized at the time of his arrest. He has since been expelled from Bacup market.

Last year, Fossey admitted engaging in a money lending operation, without a licence under the Consumer Credit Act, and two allegations of possessing criminal property.

He was given a 12 month suspended prison term after a judge said customers 'spoke highly' of Fossey and revealed they were not frightened of him.

However, yesterday he was hauled before Preston Crown Court and under Proceeds of Crime laws was ordered to back £103,000 within six months or face 21 months in prison.

Earlier, the court heard Fossey - who has also operated a mobile greengrocer's shop for 25 years - had run his loan sharking enterprise between 2008 and 2012.

He agreed to lend money to customers while conducting his fruit and veg rounds in Burnley and Rossendale and nearby Todmorden.

During the investigation, 40 victims of the illegal business were traced who were able to verify that he had been offering loans, charging interest and offering no paperwork. Many of the victims confirmed that he had continued to lend even after he had been warned.

Interest was added sporadically, but tended to vary between 25 and 30 per cent on top of the original loan. Some victims paid up to £200 on top of a £500 loan, and more than £1000 was added on to a loan of £3500.

One victim spoke of how he had been repaying the loan for more than 10 years and believed he had paid back thousands of pounds. When he was struggling to repay, he was forced to take out further loans to pay off existing ones. At the point of Fossey's arrest, he was paying up to £130 a week and was told he still owed £2,500.

Fossey, of Rossendale, Lancashire, arrived at Preston Crown Court with friends and family for the hearing in which he was ordered to pay back £103,000 within the next six months or face a prison sentence of 21 months

During a raid of Fossey’s home, Trading Standards officers found a carrier bag under his bed containing two bags of money, totalling £7,164, and documentation, in particular two notebooks, an address book and a black pad.

Also seized was a hand- written letter addressed to 'Steve' and 'Phil' from one of those who had borrowed money. The notebooks were effectively records of loans Fossey had provided over the previous 13 months.

Over that period alone there had been 196 loan accounts between the defendant and borrowers. Over 100 people had an account, some had more than one and 449 loans had been issued, including top-ups. The outstanding balance owed to Fossey was £93,918.

At an earlier hearing, Fossey's defence lawyer Mark Stuart said: 'There is no suggestion any sort of pressure was put upon people to repay.

'He was charging far less a rate of interest than those of licensed money lenders. This was going to be a pot for him, having had no pension for his retirement. He has now lost £100,000 that was owed to him.'

But Janice Hanson, Lancashire County Council cabinet member for public protection services, said: 'Illegal money lenders cause misery for some of our most vulnerable people and this case sends a clear warning that they will be pursued and prosecuted, and their assets seized.

'We will continue to work closely with the Illegal Money Lending Team and the police to protect people from loan sharks.

'If you or someone you know is in difficulty with a loan shark the best way to get help is to let us know what's happening by calling the confidential hotline.'
