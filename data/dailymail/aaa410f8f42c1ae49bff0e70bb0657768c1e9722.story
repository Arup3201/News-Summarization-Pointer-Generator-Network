A Seattle woman who lied to police and falsely accused Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch of assault could spend up to a year in jail for the stunt.

The Bellevue Police Department on Thursday recommended criminal charges against Jammie Ficarelli, 31, who told authorities that Lynch, 28, had punched her in the face on Aug. 10. She also claimed her Louis Vuitton purse had been damaged in the alleged attack.

But cops say that Ficarelli was wasted the night she claims she was assaulted and mistook a 5-foot-11 black man with dreadlocks for the NFL player, according the Bellevue Reporter.

Instead of being punched by Lynch, she drunkenly fell on her face outside the posh Bravern building — at least a mile from where Lynch had checked into the Hilton Bellevue Hotel with the rest of his team, court records show.

Seattle Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch was falsely accused of assaulting 31-year-old Jammie Ficarelli, who may now be charged with a crime for lying to cops

Bellevue Police say Ficarelli downed several drinks at the Blue Martini, inside the luxury apartment complex Bravern (pictured), and mistook another man for the Seahawks running back

Ficarelli had plowed through drinks at the Blue Martini, a bar inside the posh Bravern apartment complex, and was invited upstairs by one of the building's residents.

Security footage shows Ficarelli with this man, who wasn't identified. He told police that he repeatedly told Ficarelli he didn't play for the Seahawks, court records show.

The man says she had a 'major mood swing' when she arrived at his apartment and he asked her to leave several times.

Once outside, Ficarelli was 'swaying back and forth, had slurred speech and smelled like alcohol,' one security guard told cops.

'The female then tipped over and fell onto her right side onto the paved walkway in front of one of the Bravern businesses,' court documents show.

The security guard 'observed the right side of the female's head hit the paved sidewalk.'

Detectives later confirmed that Lynch was in his hotel room about a mile away while Ficarelli was stumbling around the Bravern apartments.

The Bellevue Police Department has been under fire for releasing Lynch's name before their investigation was complete.

Seahawks fans have taken to Lynch's defense — and Ficarelli's boyfriend claims she had to move because of all the death threats she began receiving at her home.

'Did you take pictures of his head? Did you see the cameras at his house? No. They probably didn’t do that. I think this investigation is biased,' the man told KIRO-TV.

Bellevue prosecutors are yet to decide if Ficarelli will be charged. She faces up to a year in jail and a $5,000 fine if convicted of making a false or misleading statement to a public servant, which is a misdemeanor.
