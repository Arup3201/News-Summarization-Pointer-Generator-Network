Disgraced former Paralympian Oscar Pistorius is being treated 'like royalty' in prison because guards are terrified of the public backlash should he come to any harm while serving his sentence.

The double-amputee is understood to have spent the majority of his four months incarcerated at Kgosi Mampuru II jail in Pretoria by himself, as prison officers are concerned he could be attacked or even killed if he is left to fend for himself among the general prison population.

Tomorrow marks the two-year anniversary of the Valentine's Day shooting that left Pistorius' girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp dead and lead to him being sentenced to five years in prison for culpable homicide.

A member of the 28-year-old South African's legal team claimed he was expected to serve a sixth of the sentence - around 10 months - in jail before being held under house arrest.

Pistorius has so far served four months behind bars and is believed to have already settled in to life at Kgosi Mampuru II prison in Pretoria.

Correctional officers have refused to discuss his treatment in prison, but one guard speaking on condition of anonymity told Eyewitness News that the Paralympian is being treated 'like royalty'.

The official suggested that Pistorius' management had raised concerns for the former athlete's safety, leading to prison guards doing their utmost to ensure their high-profile prisoner avoids any situation where he could be physically assaulted.

Pistorius was last year jailed for five years for killing  Steenkamp.

One of his lawyer's has claimed he was expected to serve a sixth of the sentence - around 10 months - in jail before being held under house arrest.

Pistorius was banned from all disabled competitions for five years following the conviction by the International Paralympic Committee, irrespective of whether he secures an early release.

Earlier this week Brazilian Paralympian Alan Oliveira said he wanted Pistorius to return to competitive action when he is eventually released from prison.

Oliveira said he wanted to see the six-time Paralympic champion compete again, telling BBC Sport: 'I wish he'd come back and we could run more times together.'

Pistorius made history at London 2012 by competing at the Olympics and the Paralympics, where he won two gold medals but finished second in the 200 metres behind Oliveira.

After the race the South African hit out at the IPC for failing to act over the length of some athletes' blades after the Brazilian, wearing noticeably longer ones, came from way back to pip him at the line. However, Oliveira hopes to line up against his arch-rival again.

The 22-year-old added: 'I think it'd be a good competition to see the two of us together again - repeating the duel seen in London.

'It's difficult for him to return and it would depend on how he is feeling, shaping up and of course his age, but I believe he could return and it would be great.'
