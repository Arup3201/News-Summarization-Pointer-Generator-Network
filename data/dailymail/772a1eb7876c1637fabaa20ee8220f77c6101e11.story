Lewis Hamilton waved the Union Flag aloft after winning his second — and historic — Formula One World Championship.

‘This is the greatest moment of my life,’ said Hamilton, having become only the fourth British driver to win multiple world championships and the first to do so since Sir Jackie Stewart in 1971.

His race victory here was easier than expected after his only rival, Nico Rosberg, had a battery failure, but by then Hamilton was already on his way to the championship, which he claimed by 67 points.

‘It feels surreal,’ he added. ‘It is like an out-of-body experience. I feel it’s not really happening.

‘My first title in 2008 was special but the feeling I have now is way, way past that.’

Hamilton, who won 11 of the 19 races during the season, was supported by his father Anthony and singer-songwriter girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger, who flew over unexpectedly at the last moment.

‘I didn’t sleep last night,’ said Hamilton, 29. ‘I went to bed at about 1am and woke at 5am. I went for a run and a massage. I thought I would be tired for the race but I felt composed. 

‘My family came and surprised me at breakfast, which was a really great thing.’

He texted them after qualifying, in which he was beaten to pole position by Rosberg, to say he would like them with him despite originally asking them to stay away so he could concentrate on his task. By the time he contacted them, they were already about to board a plane.

Anthony Hamilton said: ‘If someone had told me when Lewis was eight that he’d be a double champion, I’d have called them a liar. I’m so proud.’

The champagne was flowing in the Mercedes hospitality area. Niki Lauda, the Mercedes non-executive chairman, led the applause for Hamilton. 

He said: ‘Lewis is an unbelievable driver. I am especially proud because two-and-a-half years ago I asked him to leave McLaren and come to Mercedes.’

Beaten team-mate Rosberg said: ‘He deserved to win today and to win the championship. He was the best driver this year. It was a great battle between us.’

Hamilton’s old McLaren team-mate Jenson Button was fifth in what was almost certainly his final grand prix. 

He said: ‘My family and friends looked at me in a different way, which made me emotional.’
