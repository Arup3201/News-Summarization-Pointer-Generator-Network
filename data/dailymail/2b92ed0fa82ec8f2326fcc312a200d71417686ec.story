They've been married for only one year, but on Wednesday Amber Rose filed for divorce from her husband, musician Wiz Khalifa.

The 30-year-old model, who used to date Kanye West, has reportedly been spending time with her new talent manager Nick Cannon, the estranged husband of Mariah Carey.

Rose is asking for full legal and physical custody of their child, Sebastian, aged one, and is allowing Wiz visitation rights.

Divorce papers reveal the couple split on Monday and cited irreconcilable differences.

Headed for a divorce: Amber Rose filed for divorce from Wiz Khalifa on Monday, according to TMZ

Hours after news  of the split broke, sources told TMZ, however, that Cannon has nothing to do with the filing.

'He only learned about Amber's domestic problems through her lawyers last week when he signed her on as a client,' said the insider. 

'That's when Nick says he found out her marriage was on the rocks and only then did the two share break-up stories.'

It has also been learned the couple had a prenup.

'Amber acknowledges there's a prenup, which you would think would work in Wiz's favor, but she says it's valid, presumably, she's not challenging it,' added TMZ.

Legal papers say the prenup provides spousal support.

A source told the site the split is 'bitter.' Their source maintains both are accusing the other of cheating.

Amber stepped out to Wolford in Beverly Hills on Tuesday without her wedding rings, signaling that her marriage was over. That same day she posted a nude photo to her Instagram account.

On Friday she had the rings on as she attended the 10 year anniversary of Perez Hilton's blog.

And it was only two weeks ago that the short-haired star shared a touching message on her husband's birthday.

'Happy 27th Birthday @mistercap I'll love u forever.... Hope this year is an amazing one for u sweetheart ❤️'

The image was from their wedding. The two were seen in a slow dance. Khalifa looked lost in emotion as he held his new wife tight. Amber looked stunning in a white dress with a diamond necklace on her head.

It was a rare image but not an unusual show of love for the marrieds. 

This filing comes one day after the former stripper reportedly learned several nude photos of her taken on a bed had been leaked by a hacker.

Soon after the hacking scandal came to light, Amber took to her social media sites to post a racy photo as a joke, which has since been deleted.

'Well before anyone tries to hack me I figured I’d release a brand new pic of how I actually look from the back,’ she wrote, alongside the image. ‘It’s only right… Enjoy.'

As far as Cannon, the two have been spotted together several times this year.

The edgy pinup was seen with Cannon in July at the BET 106 and Park event in NYC.

He put his arm around her as they both held microphones.

On Sunday she brought her son to watch Cannon play basketball during a Power 106 All Star game in at USC in LA.

Just three days earlier the 33-year-old producer announced he had signed Amber to his management company NCredible Entertainment.

He previously cast her in his 2014 film School Dance.

The  mogul is working hard to make his new client an even bigger star as he has reportedly already landed her a television series and a book deal.

Amber will never be able to fully let go of Wiz, though.

The model has a large tattoo of the singer's face on her left arm.

She showed the ink off in May when on the carpet with Wiz at the Ditch Fridays event at the Palms Pool in Las Vegas.
