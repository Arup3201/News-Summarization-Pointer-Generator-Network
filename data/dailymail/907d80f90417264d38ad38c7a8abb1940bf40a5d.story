A 39-year-old carer who pulled a policewoman to the ground and smashed her head against a pavement, has been banned from every bar in Britain.

Rachael Hartman launched an unprovoked attack against WPC Debbie Chamberlain outside a club in Weston-super-Mare.

Hartman pleaded guilty to three counts of assault and was given a suspended jail sentence at Bristol Crown Court.

She was ordered to pay WPC Chamberlain Â£500 compensation and was banned from entering any pub or club in Britain for a year.

Officers were called to Shooters club last December when Hartman, who was already barred from the pub, poured a drink over the barman and slapped his manager.

She is said to have drunk two bottles of wine and had been in the bar since 6pm.

The mother-of-two pulled WPC Chamberlain to the ground by her hair when she tried to make an arrest.

She attacked WPC Chamberlain until her colleague used CS spray on Hartman. The victim was left with a sprained ankle, lumps on her head and scratches on her face.

Hartman had pulled out clumps of her hair during the assault.

The prosecution said when police attended the scene and tried to arrest her friend she had "lost it".

Judge Mark Horton today said her behaviour was 'appalling'.

He said: 'Police officers in our society
are to be protected by the courts because they defend the rule of law 
in this country and protect the public.

Hartman is said to have drunk two bottled of wine in quick succession. She is no banned from entering any pub, club or bar for a year

'Those who do deliberately assault officers can expect to receive an immediate custodial sentence.

'Your behaviour that night was as appalling as it was irrational. It was a sustained assault on a police officer.'

In a victim impact statement read to the court, WPC Chamberlain said: 'This attack is by far the worst I've been subjected to.

'The accident has left me more wary when dealing with confrontational situations.

'I count myself lucky I walked away with just the injuries I received especially as the back of my head was hit on the pavement.

'The incident happened around Christmas 
and I was unable to run around with my children and have quality family 
time. I was instead nursing a very sore head and limping around.'

Hartman, a support worker at the Brandon Trust which supports people with learning difficulties.

Bristol Crown Court heard how Hartman acted as a shift leader at an intense residential unit where she was a key carer for people with behavioural difficulties.

Defence lawyer, Virginia Cornwall, told the court: 'She is before the court as a woman filled with shame and embarrassment.

'Her remorse is total and she accepts her behaviour was entirely inappropriate.

'It would appear that she is somebody who does not cope well with life's difficulties. She suffers with depression and has been on medication since her teens.'

The Brandon Trust launched an internal investigation and Hartman was placed on gardening leave but the case was closed and she had been allowed to return.

The charity now say they have suspended her once more pending a further investigation into her suitability for the job.
