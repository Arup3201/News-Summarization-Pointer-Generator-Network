This is the moment a tricksy monkey managed to escape from a leopard by hiding underneath a tree branch.

The small mammal was captured giving the deadly predator the run around in woodland in East Africa.

It could be seen dangling silently beneath the branch - with its arms tensed and only its tail visible.

Meanwhile, the leopard was pictured prowling along the top of the branch, just inches away.

The incredible moment was captured by South African safari photographer, Chris Renshaw.

Footage shows the vervet monkey staring straight ahead as it hides out of sight of its natural predator, whose large paws appear to be the same size as its prey's entire body.

But despite its seemingly desperate situation, the monkey appears to have one advantage - with its light grey-coloured fur blending into its leafy surroundings.

Vervet monkeys are native to Africa, but do not live in jungles or deserts - instead, preferring to inhabit woodland near streams, rivers and lakes.

They can grow up to 24 inches and survive by eating fruit and vegetables, often supplemented with insects, grubs and baby birds.

In contrast, leopards are carnivores known for their unrivalled skill at climbing trees, ability to run at speeds of up to 36mph and adaptability to habitats, from rainforest to desert terrains.
