She found fame charting the intrigues of the Tudors which, rife with divorce, beheadings and plots, was one of history's most tumultuous dynasties.

And perhaps Hilary Mantel drew inspiration from her own volatile childhood, with the author revealing the unconventional nature of her parents' relationship and the impact it had on her.

The Wolf Hall author, 62, has told of how her mother moved her lover into the family home with Hilary, seven, and her two younger brothers, but how her father did not move out for another four years.

She also spoke candidly about their feelings towards each other, claiming her mother turned her against her father, so when he did leave, Hilary, then 11, never saw him again.

Appearing on a television chat show, she revealed how her life has been shaped by her battle with a severe form of endometriosis, which has left her unable to have children.

A guest on Skavlan last week, which broadcasts in Norway and Sweden, she told viewers: 'We had an odd family. When I was seven my mother moved her lover into the house and my father stayed. It was very strange because it was a small house but they managed to live on separate circuits.

'They stayed in this situation for four years. We lived in a small village with everyone gossiping about them and as soon as I put my foot outdoors everyone was asking me what was happening like 'Who sleeps where?'

'I did not know why they were asking this question so I learnt to shut down and not to give anything away. I did not lie on their behalf I just stayed silent really.

The Booker Prize-winning novelist is currently having her work adapted for television in BBC2's Wolf Hall (pictured)

'My real father became more and more like a ghost in our lives until he faded away entirely. At the time I had no idea he had gone. My mother for her own reasons had turned me against him and I believed he did not want any contact but now you see I don't know whether that was true.'

She has previously explored the complex relationship of her mother Margaret, father Henry Thompson and step-father Jack Mantel, in her memoir, Giving Up the Ghost, published in 2003.

An adaptation of Dame Hilary Mantel's Man Booker Prize winning novel Wolf Hall is currently on BBC2. The fourth episode of the six-part series will be shown tonight.

Being interviewed on Skavlan, she revealed how she hoped the book would reconnect her with her real father.

She said: 'When I wrote my first memoir I hoped it would bring the real information to me and it did because I found out what had happened for the rest of his life. I found he married again, a widow, and he had six children, five of them were girls.

'The eldest daughter was the same age as me. She knew I existed but I did not know she did. By that time my father had died. She helped fill in some of the missing years and she gave me back very few of his possessions and his little travelling chess set which was the object in the whole world that I associated with him. It is quite damaged, battered by the years but inside were the chess men as they always were.'

Ms Mantel also opened up about her struggle with her medical condition endometriosis and her inability to have children

She also opened up about how she has struggled with her health since she was a teenager and how, for years, was left without a diagnosis.

Miss Mantel, who is married to Gerald McEwen, suffers from a condition called endometriosis, which causes tissue that behaves like the lining of the womb to be found outside the womb. It symptoms include chronic pain and fertility problems.

She said: 'I have been ill a lot in my life. When I was 19 I realised there was something physically wrong and the doctors were very unhelpful. And basically they told me it was all in my mind and that I did not have a disease but there was.

'When I was 27 I was discovered to have a gynaecological condition which affects young women which is quite common. But by the time the disease had been given a name a great deal of damage had been done to my body. It is something I have had to live with lifelong and it is only in the last few years that I have recovered my life.

'It did influence the course of my life. I probably would not have been a writer if it had not been for this. When I was 22 I thought I must have a career and I started writing seriously but being in chronic pain does not make you saintly.

'It makes you shut down and you only have a little bit of energy so you have to ration it and you work twice as hard as other people to prove you are good to other people. Your life becomes just ambition and you don't have any fun but I have had more fun in the last year than I have had in my life.'
