Manchester United target Marco Reus refused to commit his future to Borussia Dortmund, telling an awards ceremony audience: 'We'll see about that'.

The 24-year-old was voted Dortmund's Player of the Year by newspaper Ruhr Nachrichten, after returning from injury to score 10 and assist seven of his side's next 24 goals.

The Germany international is reported to be one of Louis van Gaal's primary transfer targets, should the Dutchman replace David Moyes as manager at Old Trafford.

Despite being offered a new contract to stay at the Westfalenstadion, Reus confirmed he is yet to agree new terms - amid reports that 35million euro release clause will become active in the summer

Speaking at the awards ceremony, he said: 'It's like that in this business. Every player only has one career and wants to get the best out of it.

'You have to decide what's best for you. We'll see about that.'

The attacking midfielder has not won any silverware since joining Dortmund from Borussia MÃ¶nchengladbach in 2012 and stressed the importance of winning titles in the future.

'Every footballer has his goals and is dreaming of winning titles. At the end of your career, you want to be able to say that you've won many titles.'

Jurgen Klopp's hopes of winning trophies have been seriously dented by the sale of Dortmund's best players in recent years - with star striker Robert Lewandowski set to join Mario Gotze at main rivals Bayern Munich next season.
