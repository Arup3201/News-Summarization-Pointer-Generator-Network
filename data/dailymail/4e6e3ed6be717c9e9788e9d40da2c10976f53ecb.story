Americans are eating 23 pounds of cheese each a year - triple the amount consumed in 1970, according to a fascinating 'report card' on U.S. eating habits.Â 

The hefty serving of fromage, teamed with increased consumption of fats and oils has resulted in our overall calorific intake soaring 450 calories in the past 40 years to 2,535 a day, on average.

Center for Science in the Public Interest researcher Bonnie Leibman said while there are some signs of improvement - we're cutting back on sugars, beef, whole milk and white flour - this is still not a report card to post on the fridge.

Extra cheese: 'There's cheese in our salads, our sandwiches, our soups, and our pizza crust,' Liebman said

'(We're) eating more flour, more cheese, and more fats, with an extra shot of sugar thrown in,' she said.

'Bottom line? It's time to eat less - less red meat, less cheese, less starches, and less sweets. If Americans want straight As, they've got to do a little work.'

The study entitled 'The Changing American Diet' shows fruit and vegetable consumption has barely budged since 1970 and Americans are still choosing red meat over white, though beef consumption is lower than it has been since the 1950s.

We are eating 109 pounds of flour per year, thanks to the rise in corn flour. It's down from the 116 pound peak of 2000, right before low-carb craze began, but it's not far off.

Cheese please: Americans are eating 23 pounds of cheese each a year - triple the amount consumed in 1970. Yogurt is also on the up, while full fat ice cream consumption has dropped, according to a fascinating 'report card' on U.S. eating habits

Sweet meat: Americans are still choosing red meat over white, though beef consumption is lower than it has been since the 1950s, as shown in the above graph

'Breads, bagels, cereal, pasta, rice, crackers, granola bars, pizza, burritos, wraps, pretzels, paninis, cookies, scones, muffins, and other grain foods are still going gangbusters,' Leibman said.

'We need to switch to whole grains... and cut back on all grains.'

She said the cheese frenzy showed no sign of slowing.

'There's cheese in our salads, our sandwiches, our soups, and our pizza crust,' she said.

Calories: The hefty serving of fromage, teamed with increased consumption of fats and oils has resulted in our overall calorific intake soaring 450 calories in the past 40 years to 2,535 a day, on average

East your vegetables: The study entitled 'The Changing American Diet' shows fruit and vegetable consumption hasn't changed significantly since 1970

'Since 1970, we've gone from 8 pounds per person per year to 23 pounds. That's bad news for our arteries and waistlines.'

On the positive side, we aren't reaching for the Ben & Jerry's quite so much.

Full-fat ice cream is dipping and (mostly low-fat) yogurt is booming. However, the skim version is generally laden with sugar.

Speaking
 of sugar, we are consuming 78 pounds of sugar each a year - down from 
the sugar high of 89 pounds per person in 1999 but still too much, 
mostly as a result of sodas and other sweetened beverages that are 
linked to obesity, diabetes and heart disease.

Americans are cutting back on sugars, beef, whole milk and white flour but need to increase vegetable consumption

As well as 23lbs of cheese, each person gobbles 109lbs of flour and 78lbs of sugar a year
