A 23-year-old party girl who knifed her boyfriend in their Manhattan apartment last year has been found guilty of murder on all counts in the stabbing of her boyfriend.

Yekaterina Pusepa said the bloody brawl began with a fight over a purse that her boyfriend Alec Katsnelson left unattended while she went to the bathroom at a bar in May, 2012.

After an argument, the couple returned to their Gold St pad where Pusepa stabbed him in the chest with a nine-inch steak knife, piercing his lungs and nicking his heart.

The Latvian-born woman was charged with attempted murder last year. 

She now faces up to 25 years in prison  when she returns for sentencing in the new year.

Charged: Yekaterina Pusepa, 23 (pictured on the night of the alleged attack) was charged with attempted murder after stabbing her boyfriend during a brawl in their Manhattan apartment last year

Yekatrina Pusepa was found guilty on all counts earlier today in the bloody stabbing of her boyfriend.

Pusepa
was photographed in her blood-stained shirt after the attack.

Dressed 
in a black blazer and beige pants with her hair tied in a braid, Pusepa,
23, stared stoically as Justice Marcy Kahn polled the jury, but bowed 
her head as they all replied 'guilty'.

She then clasped her hands together and broke down sobbing as the panel filed out of the courthouse inn Manhattan Supreme Court.

Defense lawyer Kevin O’Connell said he would file a notice of appeal.

'We were disappointed in the verdict,' he said.

The jury started deliberating Wednesday morning and delivered their verdict at 10:35 a.m.

Prosecutors claimed Pusepa stabbed her boyfriend in a jealous rage after he received a text message from 
another girl.

Pusepa, however, denied the claim, saying she knifed Katsnelson after he beat her, New York Post reported. 

'[I]
asked him to look over my clutch, which had my phone, my keys and all 
my belongings,' Pusepa told jurors about the incident at watering hole, Ryan Maguire’s, where the pair had been drinking.

'When I came out, I found my clutch
was unattended in the middle of the bar.

'I
went to go look for him, and he was outside. At that 
point, I told him I wanted to go home because it frustrated me. I asked 
him to take care of something and he was being irresponsible.

'I said I wanted to take my things and go to my girlfriend’s house.’

However, the pair ended up going back to their own home together where they brawled.

Testified: Yekaterina Pusepa claimed in court yesterday she held the knife to scare off her boyfriend after he punched her in the head

She claimed they had a tumultuous relationship and her former flame was violent.

'He was kicking me and started punching me, then hit me upside the head, and that’s when I grabbed the knife,’ she said.

'He kept hitting me, asking, ‘Is this the s–t I like? Is this the s–t I like?’ He went to go swing at me again. That’s when I stabbed him.'

Pusepa also told jurors that her only intention when she reached for the blade in the early morning hours was to frighten off her beau.

'I picked up the knife just to scare him . . . I didn’t mean to hurt him,' she testified, according to New York Daily News.

'I was trying to get him off of me, make him get off of me.'

Pusepa said 'everything went in slow motion' after she plunged the knife into Katsnelson's chest.

She said he pulled the blade out before staggering downstairs to the street. She followed him down, covered in blood.

On the stand, Pusepa claimed that she knifed Katsnelson in a frenzy trying to protect herself from yet another vicious beating after months of violence.

'He was kicking me and started punching me, then hit me upside the head, and that’s when I grabbed the knife,’' she said.

'He went to go swing at me again. That’s when I stabbed him.'

Kermani noted that on the night of the attack, Pusepa told one responding cop that a black man had stabbed her lover, and told another officer that the victim was suicidal and grabbed her own hand to stab himself with the knife she was holding.

'I was just scared and in shock. I was just not in the right state of mind,' she said.

Lovers tiff: Yekaterina Pusepa (right) claimed she was frustrated her boyfriend didn't look after her purse while she went to the bathroom at a night club on the night of the fight

New York Daily News reported the pair met at a nightclub in late 2011 and their relationship was initially 'purely sexual'.

Katsnelson was arrested in March last tear for roughing her up, but she took him back in spite of a restraining order.

They gave their relationship another chance and Pusepa fell pregnant.

She had an abortion after learning the child would have to be placed in foster care due to her situation.

After the May incident, Pusepa first claimed that Katsnelson grabbed the knife and plunged it into his own chest in a suicide attempt, but then she changed her story to say she stabbed him in self-defense.

She also initially Pusepa told one responding cop that a black man had stabbed her lover.

'I was just scared and in shock. I was just not in the right state of mind,' she said.
