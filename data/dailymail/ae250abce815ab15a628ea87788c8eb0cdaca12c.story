Officials have stepped up the security presence at Gallipoli ahead of the annual Anzac Day commemorations in April, amid terrorism fears in the area. 

Terrorism concerns were raised after a female bomber killed herself and an officer on Tuesday after walking a police station in Istanbul's Sultanahmet district, disguising herself as a distressed tourist who had lost her wallet. The woman was shot after she pulled the pin on one of her grenades.  

Nearly 4000 Turkish police and paramilitary troops have been drafted in to protect the thousands of Australian tourists expected to travel to the historical site in Turkey.

Speaking to Fairfax media, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop stressed that the attack against the Istanbul police station meant tourists travelling to Turkey should execute extreme caution. 

Ms Bishop urged any Australian travelling abroad to take heed of the seriousness of the situation and asked them to regularly check the government's Smartraveller website, which is updated regularly.

The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation is also carrying out extensive tests and assessments of the area in turkey for possible terrorist attacks.

Nearly 8000 Australians are expected to travel to Gallipol for the centenary on Anzac Day in April. A national ballot was held to hand-pick the 8000 Australians who were lucky enough to be rewarded the honour. 

Turkey has become embroiled in terrorism fears since it became the main passage for fighters joining extremist groups in Syria and Iraq. 

The neighbouring conflicts have the potential to cause instability in Turkey and spill over into some of it's major cities. 

The Department of Foreign Affairs has previously voiced concerns about the possibility of attacks against targets in Turkey, including Ankara, Istanbul or areas close to the Syrian border.

Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott is expected to be joined by Prince Charles and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the event.

Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald, Australian National University terrorism expert Clarke Jones said the Anzac Day commemorations in Turkey was a high risk event.

'It is a valuable target and it would be quite strategic for, say, Islamic State to launch something in Turkey. Gallipoli is a fair distance from the border of Syria and Iraq but distance is not big deal if they wanted to do it … especially given the porous border.' 

While the government's Smartraveller website says that the security environment in Turkey is volatile and may change between now and April 2015, they have urged Australia tourists to plan their trip in advance and be sure to purchase travel insurance. 

Tight security arrangements will be in place for the commemorations. Turkish authorities will screen all visitors on arrival. All bags will be searched and prohibited items will be confiscated.
