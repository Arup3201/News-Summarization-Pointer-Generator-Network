Christmas came early for Arsenal as they were rewarded for a return to form with a three-day festive break to revive their minds and bodies.

Arsene Wenger told his players to report back on Wednesday after they moved to within two points of the Barclays Premier League’s top four with a 4-1 win against Newcastle.

They started by pulling on ironic seasonal knitwear and throwing a party. ‘We will not have Christmas so I’ve given the players some days off,’ said Wenger.

Olivier Giroud has six goals in five Premier League appearances against Newcastle.

‘It’s important to have a break. When you count the number of games with the Champions League, the players will not be at home over Christmas so to have two or three days at home is important.

‘Most of them will stay in England because their families are here.’

Arsenal have played 26 times this season — starting with the Community Shield and the Champions League play-off ties against Besiktas — and have been suffering from injuries.

Next Sunday’s game at Anfield will be the first of five in 15 days for Wenger’s team — a congested sequence shared by all Premier League clubs — and he wants his players to be mentally and physically fresh.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is the latest injury concern. He hurt his groin near the end of the Newcastle game.

‘He got a knock and I took him off quickly,’ said Wenger. ‘He’s got a pain in his groin. I wanted to take him off and then he takes the ball and crosses the whole pitch and he cannot run anymore.

‘We cannot afford to lose him. I hope it’s nothing bad. He had a bit of inflammation before the game. I took him to Galatasaray and maybe two games was a lot for him.’

Arsene Wenger was pleased with his side's performance which leaves them two points off the top four

Theo Walcott could be back in the squad to face Liverpool but Aaron Ramsey is expected to be out for four weeks with a hamstring injury.

The club are quietly confident they can acquire defensive reinforcements in January, which they need with Laurent Koscielny struggling again with his achilles tendons.

With Calum Chambers suspended and Nacho Monreal injured, right back Mathieu Debuchy played at centre half in only his second game back after three months out with an ankle injury.

‘I still need to work hard to come back to my best physical level,’ said Debuchy. ‘It was a freak injury. Usually, no-one gets injured like this. Maybe it was post-World Cup tiredness.’

Also back after a broken ankle is Olivier Giroud, who scored twice against Newcastle. He has three in five appearances after three months on the sidelines.

Wenger believes his presence and attitude lifts the team as well as providing goals and a more direct tactical option.

‘It’s not just him as a player, but something as well in his mentality,’ said the Arsenal boss. ‘He’s such a positive guy. Even when he misses, people forgive him. He has had a positive mental impact as well as physical impact.

‘He is like an English centre forward. His first goal was a typical 1970s goal. You love it because you see it less now.

‘He gives us different options because we can go for a longer ball. We have plenty of players who can go short and he gives us a variety in our game.

‘He wasn’t at his best at Stoke and he had something to show against Newcastle and he responded well.’

Santi Cazorla scored twice for the hosts either side of a well-taken effort by Newcastle’s in-form striker Ayoze Perez.
