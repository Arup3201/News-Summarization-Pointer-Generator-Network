Underfire: Daniel Harding was the subject of a withering attack after joining La Scala in January

A renowned British conductor is at the heart of a public spat between an Italian opera house and a verbose critic who has accused him of making Wagner sound 'homosexual'.

Well-respected Daniel Harding, who is conducting at Milan's La Scala opera house, was subjected to a withering attack by opera reviewer Paolo Isotta after he arrived at the theatre in January.

The fierce critic, who writes for Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, launched his first scathing comments on the 37-year-old by describing his conducting of Verdi's Falstaff as 'heavy and pedantic'.

An unrepentant Mr Isotta then described Mr Harding's interpretation of a piece from Wagner's Tristan and Isolde as 'so soft it made you think he wanted to back the unfounded theory that Wagner was homosexual.'

But the criticism has proved too much for La Scala's manager Stéphane Lissner, the Daily Telegraph reported.

He has struck Mr Isotta from the critic list, forcing him to purchase a ticket if he wants to hear performances.

Mr Lissner said: 'Isotta has decided to wage a personal campaign.'

The newspaper's editor Ferruccio de Bortoli defended the critic, according to The Daily Telegraph.

Mr Harding has impressed the musical world with his talents, despite having never having any formal conductor training.

You're barred: The critic has now been taken off the official list at La Scala, in Milan, after his repeated attacks

He was a member of the National Youth Orchestra at age 13 having studied the trumpet, but began a career in conducting at age 17, after he sent a tape of a performance her conducted to prominent conductor Sir Simon Rattle.

He became Rattle's assistant at the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra from 1993-1994 and after his first year at university, he became an assistant with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, conducting them aged just 21.

The critic did not enjoy Harding's 'soft' conducting of Wagner

He performed as a conductor at The Proms in 1996, making him the youngest-ever conductor to appear there.

Harding is a regular visitor to the Dresden Staatskapelle, the Vienna Philharmonic, the Berlin Philharmonic, Royal Concertgebouworkest, Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, Leipzig Gewandhausorchester and the Orchestra Filarmonica della Scala.

In the U.S. and in Canada he has performed with the Philadelphia Orchestra, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Chicago, Atlanta, Baltimore, Houston and Toronto Symphony Orchestras.

He was recently honoured with the lifetime title of Conductor Laureate of the Mahler Chamber Orchestra, where he previously held the positions of Music Director and Principal Conductor. He is Artistic Director of the Ohga Hall in Karuizawa, Japan.

Mr Harding could not be reached for comment on the spat with Mr Isotta.

Richard Wagner married a woman called Cosima, the daughter of the Hungarian pianist and composer Franz Liszt, who was 24 years his junior.

She was his second wife and founded the Bayreuth Festival with him as a showcase for his stage works.
