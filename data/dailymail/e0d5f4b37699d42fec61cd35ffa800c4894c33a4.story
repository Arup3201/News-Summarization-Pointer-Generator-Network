They may look good enough to eat, but these images of realistic-looking meals are actually made entirely of lambswool.

From the Great British fry-up to a traditional roast dinner, art director and model maker Jessica Dance has recreated beloved classic dishes to scale - in a format not safe for human consumption.

Each tiny baked bean is individually sewn and yarn colour is alternated to show grill marks on meats, making the brightly-coloured reproduction dinners hyper-realistic, and also cartoon-like; what a perfect diner advertisement might resemble.

The Comfort Food series is a knitted project by Jessica Dance with photographer David Sykes - the burger came first

The project is a collaboration between ex-fashion student Dance, 26, from east London, and photographer David Sykes, 38, from London.

Aptly called Comfort Food, the series aims to encapsulate the mood of the classic British caf√©, fast food joint and burger van - but with a woolly twist.

The burger meal - 'fast food reimagined' -
 was knitted first. It features individually knitted fries in a red chip box, a mounded burger bun encasing a beef burger, and meticulous 
detailing such as tomatoes, gherkins and floppy processed cheese.

Once the burger had been shot, David and Jessica decided on the other dishes.

They wanted to pick iconic dishes and thought, 'What's more iconic than a full English breakfast?', and recreated a classic fry-up form wool.

For this one, Jessica had to make lots 
of baked beans out of wool to scale - 'They took a while to make,' she 
says, 'but were well worth it as they worked really well'.

It features a cup of tea, toast, beans, tomato, egg, sausage, bacon with fat, mushroom and butter - all knitted to scale from representative multicoloured yarn.

The next 
shot was the classic American hotdog. The pair muse that while it was the simplest dish to 
produce, it created one of the most graphic and striking images of the series.

The
 hot dog features a white and beige knitted hot dog bun - just like a 
real one - and a pinkish hot dog with a yellow wiggly strip of mustard running down its length.

While shooting the first shots in this series, David mentioned that he wanted to send out a Christmas card and it would be great to make a Christmas dinner. So Jessica went away and created a full roast dinner out of wool.

The roast came with all the trimmings, complete with woolly pigs in blankets - a must have at any Christmas roast - Brussels sprouts, carrots, cranberries, roast potatoes, gravy, and an entire turkey.

Both David and Jessica have a meticulous attention to detail and their collaborative projects are very much a meeting of minds.

Jessica knits all of her woolly creations on her vintage domestic knitting machine and sculpts the foundations of the models by hand in her east London studio.

David wanted the images to look like they were classic food photography, but on closer inspection turned out to be made of wool, so they styled the sets to be as real as possible. To help with the double take effect, David lit them in the same way he would light one of his shoots with real food.

David and Jessica are planning to have an exhibition in London later in the year showing all their woolly projects, complete with large scale photographic prints of the work and also the actual models Jessica made for the shoots.
