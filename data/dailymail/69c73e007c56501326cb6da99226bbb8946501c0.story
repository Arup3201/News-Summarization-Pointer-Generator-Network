Lindsay Lohan arrived under a cover of darkness today as she reported for community service at the LA County Morgue.

But she was not let in until 6am, when she was pictured being ushered in via the back door.

Caught on camera: Lindsay Lohan arrived early today to perform community service at Los Angeles County Morgue

Running ahead of schedule: Lindsay turned up at 5.30am - although she was not let inside until 6am

Lohan was chauffeur driven to the morgue in her black Cadillac Escalade and aerial shots capture the Mean Girls star exiting the vehicle.

Dressed appropriately in mournful black, Lindsay was wearing a hooded jacket teamed with leggings, booted heels and shades.

She kept her face hidden under her 
hoodie as she entered the building at the back - a special privilege afforded 
to her because of the huge media presence outside.

Members of the general public who perform community service at the morgue have to use the front entrance.

Media frenzy: Assistant
 Chief Coroner Ed Winter speaks to the waiting Press

Yesterday Lindsay was turned away from the morgue by staff after rolling up in an $80,000 Porsche Panamera - 40 minutes late.

There are around ten other people 
serving community service at the morgue today - but it is believed 
Lindsay could be kept separate from them.

Lindsay is reported to have cheered staff at the morgue today by treating them to lunch from the California favourite, In 'N' Out burger.

The actress made the gesture after staff were told to bring packed lunches today because they are not able to leave the building for a break, due to the extensive media presence outside.

But while Radar Online reported that the burger lunch went down well, 36 fancy cupcakes were turned away.

It was initially unclear who had ordered the cupcakes, but Lohan's spokesman has now admitted it was Lindsay.

The spokesman explained it was intended as a a sorry gesture to staff after she turned up late yesterday, saying: 'Lindsay ordered cupcakes for the staff 
and volunteers. When they were delivered, morgue supervisors would not 
let them into the building.'

'It is unfortunate that Lindsay's well-intentioned actions were not 
taken in the spirit in which she intended... to say she was sorry for 
yesterday's misunderstanding.'

Assistant chief coroner Ed Winter told TMZ that they wouldn't be accepting food and sent the delivery man from Magnolia Bakery in Beverly Hills away.

Everyone has been told to bring packed lunches today - as they will not be allowed out of the building, Good Day LA reports.

The TV network spoke to a 23-year-old named only as Evan who is also performing community service at the morgue.

He said duties included cleaning sinks
 and bathrooms and 'going where the bodies are to cut out plastic sheets
 that are used to wrap the bodies in'.

Sources have since told TMZ.com that Lindsay is on sheet washing duty - and covered her mouth in shock when she first set eyes on some blood-stained sheets.

While her duties do not involve handling corpses in any way, she has apparently set eyes on a dead body and seemed 'shocked', the website reports.

Lohan has to complete 16 hours between now and her next court appearance on November 2.

Photos from yesterday show her arriving in the morgue's car park before being turned away by staff.

After
 finding herself with her day unexpectedly free, Lohan decided to put 
her time to good use by attending a last minute therapy session.

Lindsay posted on Twitter yesterday: 'With all of 
the stress and pressure from yesterday and today, I've never been so 
happy to go to therapy!!!! Also, I'm sorry for the confusion that I may 
of caused to those at the Coroner's office. Won't happen again, now I 
know where to go! Thank you for your help.'

Although the LA Coroner's spokesman 
said Lohan was 40 minutes late to her 8am appointment, she claimed she 
was 'approximately 20 minutes late'.

Man in demand: Winter turned Lindsay away from the morgue yesterday after she arrived late

But
 after her 'confusion' over what entrance to use on Thursday, her 
publicist insisted the actress would report to the morgue on time later 
today.

Her publicist Steven Honig said: 'Lindsay arrived at the 
morgue approximately 20 minutes late and will be returning for 
orientation tomorrow.

'Her lateness was due to a combination 
of not knowing what entrance to go through and confusion caused by the 
media waiting for her arrival.

Too late! Yesterday Lindsay was turned away after she arrived 40 minutes late in a Porsche

'Lindsay 
spoke with the supervisors at the morgue. They showed her how to get in,
 and everything is all cleared up.'

Assistant
 Chief Coroner Ed Winter, 
however, is unconvinced by Lohan's excuse, telling reporters that she 
has been to the morgue before so should have known where to go. And she 
may not just be able to turn up today without the judge's permission.

Winter added: 'Ms. Lohan has to have permission from the probation department and/or 
the judge, that she can come back.

'I haven't heard from the probation 
department or the judge about whether or not Ms. Lohan will be allowed 
to come back.'

Well the rest of the day is free now... Lindsay made use of her free time yesterday by going to the dentist to get her teeth whitened

However, Lindsay still believes she is on track. 'She is going to 
orientation tomorrow unless the Court tells her otherwise, which has not
 happened,' Steve Honig, Lohan's spokesperson told Radar.

Lohan will face the wrath of Judge Sautner on her November court appearance.

Lohan is already skating on thin ice 
with Sautner, who on Wednesday blasted the Machete actress for not making 
an effort to complete her probation.

Clean-up duty: Lohan has been ordered to complete 16 hours at the morgue before her next court hearing on November 2

The judge is incensed the actress has
 barely scratched the surface of the 480 hours of community service she 
was ordered to complete as part of her sentence for the theft of a gold 
necklace earlier this year.

Lohan only did around a 
day-and-a-half at the Downtown Women's Centre in LA - and failed to show
 up nine times, resulting in her being rejected from the programme.

This week she did some volunteer work
 for the Red Cross - but Sautner ruled it as void because it was not 
part of the sentence she had specifically stipulated at an earlier 
hearing.

Finding her feet: Lindsay tweet from yesterday apologising 
for the confusion at the morgue and suggesting she had got lost

Sautner said only time completed at the women's centre and the morgue counted.

In a further development, LA County 
Sheriff Lee Baca has told Fox 11's Good Day LA that the overcrowding 
issue will not keep Lohan out of jail.

He told the show that if Lindsay is 
sentenced to jail time he will make sure he finds room for her, adding 
she needs at least 60 days inside to be rehabilitated.

What a twit: She also tweeted that she was pleased to be going to therapy after a stressful day yesterday and in court on Wednesday

The news comes after Lohan's father Michael spoke out, alleging his daughter was back on drugs and needs help.

He said the recent photos of her 
discoloured and apparently rotting teeth was down to her smoking 
methamphetamine or crack cocaine. 

Lohan posted $100,000 bail on Wednesday following her court hearing.

Meanwhile, the beleaguered star's mother is set to blow the lid on her daughter's alleged drug and alcohol use in a memoir she's currently shopping around Hollywood.

Website TMZ has obtained the draft of a prologue for Dina Lohan's memoir, which Dina's spokesperson is pitching to the literary world. 

An excerpt from the prologue allegedly written by Dina says: 'I blamed her friends, her career and her handlers for an (sic) newfound lifestyle of partying excessively. 

'Drinking, drugging and behaving irresponsibly became Lindsay's way of daily living--and it tore me up inside.'
