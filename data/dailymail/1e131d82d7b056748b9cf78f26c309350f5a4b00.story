It may be a far cry from the millionaire's playground of Monaco, but Radamel Falcao appeared to be enjoying himself as he took a stroll around Manchester city centre.

The prolific Colombian has arrived at Manchester United on a season-long loan, which supporters hope can restore the club's place among the Premier League elite after a fall from grace under David Moyes.

Falcao was accompanied by his wife, Argentine singer Lorelei Taron, and young daughter Dominique as he explored the Spinningfields area of the city before heading into Australasia restaurant for something to eat.

The former Porto and Atletico Madrid striker may have taken the opportunity to practice his new language after manager Louis van Gaal insisted that everyone at the club speak English. 

'You know already that all the Spanish players have lessons in English so we have started already more than two weeks,' he was quoted as saying  in the Manchester Evening News. 

'But they shall learn English within one year, I promise.'

The 28-year-old made his Old Trafford debut after coming on as a substitute during United's 4-0 demolition of QPR on Sunday.

Although he failed to score, Falcao was given a rousing welcome by United supporters and appeared untroubled by the cruciate ligament knee injury that forced him to miss the 2014 World Cup.
