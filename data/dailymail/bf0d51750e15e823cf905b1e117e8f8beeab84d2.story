Bayer Leverkusen are considering a bid for Tottenham striker Roberto Soldado.

Hamburg are interested in Leverkusen's unsettled Swiss striker Josip Drmic and Leverkusen want a replacement.

They have enquired about Soldado but are reluctant to match Tottenham's valuation with Daniel Levy keen to recoup much of the £26million he paid for the 29-year-old.

Spurs supporters remain behind the Spanish striker, even though his goalscoring record at White Hart Lane has fallen short of what they were expecting when he moved from Valencia.

Soldado has found the net just four times this term and missed a glaring opportunity against Sunderland at the weekend.

Regardless, fans are behind him given his workrate and link-up play.
