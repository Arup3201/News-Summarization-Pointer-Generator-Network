Airstrikes in Syria could stir up lone wolf terrorists carry out attacks on U.S. soil in retaliation for the American incursion into the war-torn country, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security have warned.

A U.S.-led coalition has hit dozens of ISIS targets in Iraq and Syria in the last three days in an effort to thwart the extremist terrorist group and spot them plotting attacks against the U.S.

However, the FBI and Homeland Security sent out a bulletin to police departments around the country on Tuesday that the military strikes could provoke new attacks from terrorists already in the U.S. - with 'little or no warning.'

Fighting back: U.S. strikes against ISIS in Syria and Iraq could stir up homegrown lone wolf terrorists to carry out attacks on American soil, the FBI and Homeland Security have warned

'We believe these strikes will contribute to homegrown violent extremists’… broader grievances about U.S. military intervention in predominantly Muslim lands, possibly motivating Homeland attacks,' the federal government warned. 

The greatest risk at this time is not from ISIS or other terrorist organizations plotting large-scale attacks on U.S. soil, the agencies said. 

Instead, local police should be on the lookout for attack similar to the Boston Marathon bombings, which were carried out by two brothers who became radicalized by online Islamist propaganda, but were not affiliated with al-Qaeda or any other terrorist network. 

Three people were killed and 264 were wounded on April 15, 2013 when the brothers detonated two homemade pressure cooker bombs packed with gunpowder from fireworks and nails and ball bearings. 

ISIS uses a sophisticated and highly visible propaganda operation on social media that had drawn hundreds of westerners to Syria and Iraq to fight on their side.

According to the FBI bulletin, the group has already called on followers to carry out 'lone offender attacks in the Homeland in retaliation for U.S. military operations in Iraq and Syria.'

American diplomats convinced  five Sunni Muslim nations - Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Bahrain - to help carry out strikes against ISIS in Syria and Iraq, in attempt to increase their legitimacy in the Arab World. 

However, the New York Times reports that American fighter jets and cruise missiles from American destroyers are carrying out nearly all of the strikes - with occasional assistance from Arab allies.

Biggest threat is from plotters who are working on their own and not officially connected to a terror group
