AFL star Lance 'Buddy' Franklin was involved in a car crash on Wednesday night, with a witness claiming that four parked cars were 'totalled' by the Sydney Swans player.

The boyfriend of Jesinta Campbell allegedly drove along New South Head Road in Rose Bay, Sydney, when the incident occurred around 7.30pm.

The 27-year-old was driving a black Jeep SUV that belongs to his model and TV presenter partner, the same vehicle they were caught parking in a disabled spot in back in January.

The Sydney Swans confirmed that their $10 million star recruit was involved in the crash, was alone at the time and walked away unharmed.

A New South Wales police spokesman said that people were alerted to the incident after 'residents reported hearing a car crash'.

'Inquires are continuing after a car hit a number of parked vehicles in Rose Bay tonight,' he told AFL.com.au.

'A Jeep that was travelling west on New South Head road hit four parked vehicles, all four vehicles were damaged as a result of the crash.

Towed away: The car was unable to drive from the scene and Franklin gave a statement to police at the site

A male witness who first responded to the crash told MailOnline Franklin 'collected' four parked cars on New South Head road and 'totalled' the jeep he was driving in.

'It was half up on the gutter, half on the road and facing in toward the footpath,' he said.

'It's gone.'

The collision caused the airbags of the jeep Franklin was driving in to deploy. They said Franklin was traveling alone and did not appear intoxicated.

'He wasn't drunk or anything, he was fine. He was giving police a statement and then he left eastbound.'
