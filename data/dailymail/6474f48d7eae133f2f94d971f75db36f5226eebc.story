If you're on the well-endowed side of the underwear alphabet, wearing a bra that doesn't feel like it's reinforced with iron rods may seem like a mere fantasy - not anymore.

Those trusty underwear scientists at M&S have come up with an invention that made our ears prick up, and is said to be guaranteed to make some other body parts perk up too.

Fresh from the M&S lingerie laboratory comes a new non-wired bra for those blessed with DD+ cups and larger.

M&S's new non wired bra (left and right) promises all the support of an underwired bra without the stiff infrastructure

Instead of providing underwired support, the new gravity-defying piece of engineering uses 'compressed cup technology'.

So what does that actually mean? The foam cups are specially moulded and shaped to give support and compression in key areas of the cup in order to simulate the shape and support a wire gives. It took over a year for the experts to find exactly the right balance of compression to create a sexy, plunging, yet comfortable and supported shape.  

It also includes a supportive cradle and smoothing wing shape and help keep the bra in place and give a flattering smoothing back feature and prevent any unsightly back bulges or VBL (visible bra line!).

The straps are also made of densely woven fabric for improved support.

The
 clothing giant's head of lingerie innovation, Paschal Little, said: 
'Compressed cup technology is the hidden secret behind our innovative 
new DD+ bra.

'Fitted
 and developed on real women, this innovative bra has been developed 
using decades of M&S technical know-how, together with highly 
skilled, specialist lingerie manufacturers.'

The non wired invention is available in two colours and is priced at £22.50

Soozie Jenkinson, head of lingerie 
design for M&S, added: 'We are excited to launch this state-of-the-art
 non wired DD+ bra/ Designed with a beautiful plunge neckline this bra is developed for women who are
 looking for a non-wired DD+ bra that still delivers on great shape 
definition and support,' she says.

COOL COMFORT: A special formulation finish, used in bras, nightdresses and slips, which wicks away moisture from the body to keep the wearer feeling fresh and cool. It's also used in no VPL shaping knickers. Cool comfort slips start from £19.50

MARVELACE: Created using the very latest knitting technology, Marvelace, creates firm control. It sculpts and shapes while still feeling beautifully soft and lightweight - flattening tummies, smoothing backs and defining curves for a gorgeous, glamorous silhouette. It’s also incredibly comfortable to wear. Bodies and slips from £39.50

PERFECT POISE: This range, designed in association with the British Chiropractic Association, encourages and improves your posture through the use of panels and cleverly hidden padding supporting your back and bust. The bra and body use specially designed back panels which fall across the centre of the shoulders to add support encouraging the wearer to keep their shoulders back making them less likely to slouch. Bras from £26.50
