Team news: Chile are hoping star midfielder Arturo Vidal is fit and able to play when they square off against Australia in Cuiaba on Friday.

The Juventus player has been struggling with inflammation in his right knee following an operation on his meniscus last month and has had a big question mark over his availability for the World Cup Group B games ever since.

Vidal, a free-kick specialist, has trained with the team since Wednesday and featured for 15 minutes in a 2-0 friendly win over Northern Ireland last week.

Injury doubt: Chile's Arturo Vidal could miss the match with Australia with a knee problem

'Arturo trained like the rest of us,' Chile midfielder Gary Medel said. 'He did a good job and didn't have any pain in his knee.

'We hope that he can be with us for the first game. It will depend on him and how he feels. We want him to take care of himself and if he does play, we hope it (meniscus) doesn't affect him.'

Experienced striker Tim Cahill will lead the Socceroos' attack while veteran midfielder Mark Bresciano is doubtful with a back injury.

The biggest challenge for Australia, who are competing in their third straight World Cup finals, is the lack of experience for many of their players.

Leading the way: Veteran striker Tim Cahill will be up front for Australia

A total of seven players in the squad are currently on the books of A-League clubs.

'For a lot of these players it's their first go at the big stage and I'm sure there's a little bit of uncertainty in their heads,' Postecoglou said. 'If we can get through those initial moments we'll be fine.'

Crystal Palace midfielder Mile Jedinak will captain Australia.

Key clash: Alexis Sanchez v Jason Davidson

Sanchez successfully emerged from Lionel Messi’s shadow at Barcelona this season and the lightning-quick forward will be looking to lead Chile in Brazil. He is more than capable of exploiting the gaps left by Davidson on Australia’s left-hand side, with the full-back known more for his attacking than defensive play.

Danger man: Alexis Sanchez will be one of Chile's main creative influences

Tough ask: Australia's Jason Davidson has the task of keeping an eye on Alexis Sanchez in the match

One to watch: Marcelo Diaz (Chile)

English teams have tended to wilt against Basel in recent years and Diaz is one of the main reasons why. Comparisons with Xavi are slightly far-fetched, but the composed midfielder performs a similar role making his teams tick at both club and international level.

Head-to-head record: Played 4 Chile Wins 3 Draws 1
