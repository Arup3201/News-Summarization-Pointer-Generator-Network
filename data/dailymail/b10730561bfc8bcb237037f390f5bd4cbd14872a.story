Citigroup Inc's Automated Trading Desk had trading losses of about $20million from Facebook Inc's botched initial public offering on Nasdaq OMX Group Inc's U.S. exchange, a source with knowledge of the situation said on Friday.

The unit's losses were in addition to claims by market makers Knight Capital Group Inc and Citadel Securities, which each had losses of $30 million to $35 million.

UBS AG, the other large market maker involved in the IPO of the social networking company on May 18, has not disclosed any losses.

Tumbling: Citigroup lost around $20m during Facebook's botched IPO, a source says

That sinking feeling: UBS lost around $30m in Facebook's IPO

Nasdaq asked firms to detail estimates of losses by Monday night.

After that, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority will evaluate the filings and put out a report on the matter in about four weeks, two sources said.

A technical glitch delayed Facebook's market debut by 30 minutes and many client orders were delayed, giving some investors and traders significant losses as the stock price dropped.

The exchange operator is facing lawsuits from investors and threats of legal action from brokers.

UBS AG had trading losses of around $30 million stemming from Facebook Inc's botched initial public offering on Nasdaq OMX Group Inc's U.S. exchange, a source with knowledge of the situation said, also on Friday.

UBS was one of four main market makers involved in Facebook's IPO on May 18.

Its losses come on top of claims by Citigroup's market making unit of $20 million, and Knight Capital Group Inc and Citadel Securities of $30 million to $35 million each in losses.

Claims by four of Wall Street's main market makers against Nasdaq over Facebook's botched IPO are likely to exceed $100million, as they and other traders continue to deal with thousands of problems with customer orders.

Faceplant: Nasdaq may lose the Facebook listing entirely after having just obtained it

Four of the top market makers in the Facebook IPO - Knight Capital, Citadel Securities, UBS AG and Citi's Automated Trading Desk - collectively have probably lost more than $100million from problems arising from the deal, said a senior executive at one of the firms.

Knight and Citadel are each claiming losses of $30million to $35million, potentially overwhelming a $13 million fund the exchange set up to deal with potential claims.

Nasdaq also has to contend with the outside prospect that it could lose the Facebook listing entirely after having just obtained it.

Facebook shares ended regular trading on Thursday up 3.2 per cent at $33.03, about $5 short of their offering price.

Action on the stock, however, has essentially become secondary to the fallout from the IPO - its price, its size, its execution and questions about selective disclosure of its financial prospects.

Regulators including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin are now looking into how the IPO was handled.

The U.S. Senate Banking Committee is also reviewing the matter.

Under exchange rules, Nasdaq's liability regarding client losses from certain trading issues is limited to $3 million a month.

Market makers will be arguing that Nasdaq was so grossly negligent that its actions during the IPO opening override the limits, said a source with knowledge of Knight's situation.

Other firms said they did not have similar problems to those of Knight, raising questions about the scope of the losses.

'The problems were where people were trying to cancel orders; we didn't have that,' said Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak & Co in New York. 'Because we didn't have a problem doesn't mean there weren't problems.'

E*Trade Financial Corp said its market making operations realized losses of 'well under a million dollars.'

Charles Schwab Corp had a 'small number' of the 'tens of thousands of clients' who traded Facebook whose issues still have not been resolved, a spokesman said. 'Each one requires some analysis to resolve, which can be time consuming.'

Shares of Nasdaq fell 1 cent to $21.80 on Thursday.

As of Thursday's close the stock was down 5.2 per cent from its last close before the Facebook debacle. Over the same period NYSE Euronext is down just 0.1 per cent.

The slide in the shares is adding to the pressure on Nasdaq Chief Executive Robert Greifeld, who defended the exchange's performance at its annual meeting last Tuesday.
