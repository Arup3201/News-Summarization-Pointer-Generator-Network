'Deeply shocked': Australian Prime minister Julia Gillard was likened to a quail with 'small breasts, huge thighs and a big red box' on a menu drawn up by the opposition Liberal Party

Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard was said to be 'deeply shocked' today by a sexist dinner menu drawn up by the opposition Liberal Party in which she was likened to a quail with 'small breasts, huge thighs and a big red box'.

Details of the menu at a fundraising event in Brisbane were revealed after Miss Gillard's warning that if her Labour Party lost the general election in September, the incoming Liberals would be 'dominated by men in blue ties' and women would be given only minor roles.

But her remarks paled into insignificance with the new row over the dinner menu which former Labour Prime Minister Kevin Rudd described as a 'snide, dirty and sexist trick.'

Former Liberal government minister Mal Brough who was involved with organising the dinner apologised for what he said was a 'deeply offensive and sexist description' of the Prime Minister.

Political observers said the dinner menu's contents had blunted the Liberal Party's attack on Miss Gillard's campaign to warn about about the threat of male dominance in government if the Liberals won the election, as the opinion polls are suggesting.

The dinner menu made its unsubtle attack on British-born Miss Gillard under the title of Moroccan Quail.

It described the dish as: 'Julia Gillard Kentucky Fried Quail - Small Breasts, Huge Thighs and a Big Red Box.'

Mr Rudd, the former Labour Prime Minister who was pushed aside by Miss Gillard in a party room coup in June 2010 but who is rumoured to be planning a fight-back for the top job, was also targeted on the menu.

His name was linked to a dish called 'Rudd's a Goose Foie Gras.'

Hitting out today, Mr Rudd, who by coincidence was wearing a bright blue tie, savaged Mr Brough for the stunt.

'He's a former minister in the Howard government, number two he's a highly experienced politician, number three he organised the fundraiser which used all these menus, four it wasn't a mistake - he knew it was being used - five he's apologised because he's been found out,' said Mr Rudd.

He suggested that every dollar raised at the fundraising event should now be donated to the RSPCA as a mark of contrition.

Liberal leader Tony Abbott was also quick to condemn the menu, calling it 'tawdry'.

'I think we should all be bigger and better than that,' he said.

Mr Rudd is being regularly touted as the man preparing himself to challenge Miss Gillard for the Labour leadership and get his old job back as Prime Minister before the September election.

He has constantly denied the rumours and he insisted that his decision to wear a blue tie just 24 hours after Miss Gillard had spoken out against 'men in blue ties' was not a declaration of war on Miss Gillard.

'Like most blokes in the country, I have no sense of fashion,' he said.

He said he relied on his wife Therese and daughter Jessica to choose his ties and 'this was the one packed for this particular occasion.

'If I had to get ride of all my blue ties I'd lose about a third of them.'
