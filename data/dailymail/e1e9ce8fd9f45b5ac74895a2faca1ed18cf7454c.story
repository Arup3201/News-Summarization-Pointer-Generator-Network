As the World Cup kicks off in Brazil today, the WAGs are cramming their Christian Louboutins into their Louis Vuitton
 suitcases to fly out and join their other halves.

Coach Roy Hodgson has told his boys their wives aren't officially 
authorised to be there and has banned them from travelling with the team.

But 
luckily for us - and Brazil's retail economy - the likes of Coleen Rooney and Alex Gerrard, whose husbands Wayne Rooney and Steven Gerrard are key players, may well be setting up camp in 
Brazil anyway.

FEMAIL caught up with the two glamorous footballers' wives to find out their summer style, beauty and fitness tips.

Chief WAG: Coleen Rooney, who is married to England player Wayne, is preparing to jet off to Brazil to support her husband in the World Cup and has shared her summer beauty tips with FEMAIL

Leading the pack is the WAG who needs
 no introduction; Wayne Rooney's wife Coleen, who is packing her bags ahead of the tournament.

The
 28-year-old mother-of-two told MailOnline: 'I'm so excited to go as I've never been before and I'm always really curious to discover new places. I'm sure when we find our feet there, we will have a great time.'

While Coleen may have become notorious for her penchant for designer handbags and high-end clothes, the mother of two reveals that she's going to be embracing a more casual style in Brazil.

'I don't think many of the football fans will be dressing up so I am going for the casual look, nothing too dressy. I am loving tailored shorts at the moment, which I'll team with wedges and some fashionable jewellery.

New campaign: Coleen is currently fronting the new Comfort Creations campaign, a new perfume-scented range of washing detergents, and says the ultra-feminine campaign reflects her personal style

'I also love crop tops but because I don't like showing my belly, I will wear them with high-waisted shorts.'

The Littlewoods designer says her favourite high-street store is Zara, because it takes trends straight from the catwalk, while her favourite designer label is Balenciaga because the clothes help 'show off her figure well' and cinch in at the waist, her least favourite body part.

Sharing her top tips for looking glam poolside , something Coleen knows all about, she said: 'My top tip is getting a well-fitting bikini. Lots of people get it wrong and when I designed my range for Littlewoods, I really focused on creating a fit for every body type.'

Coleen, who cites her style icon as 'gorgeous' Blake Lively, will also be cramming lots of kaftans, kimonos and maxi dresses into her suitcase for Brazil.

As for her Brazilian beauty regime, Coleen says she will be keeping it natural. 'I barely wear any make-up on holiday and just pop on some blush when I head out,' she said.

The WAG who needs no introduction: Coleen 
Rooney, 28, who is married to Wayne has announced that she - and no 
doubt her many Louis Vuitton suitcases - will be making the trip to 
Brazil

She hasn't been working out too much ahead of her trip ('I'm not doing more than usual,' she said), and has scheduled in some pilates sessions in the week running up to her flight.

Professional as always, Coleen has been cramming in her work duties ahead of the trip. Yesterday, she helped launch the new Comfort Creations range, a range of fabric conditioner blended by perfume experts.

As someone with a passion for fashion, this was a campaign close to Coleen's heart. 'When they approached me to work with them, I thought it was a fantastic idea. Obviously having kids, I do so much washing so I want it to smell nice and this is the first product out there like this.

'Like all women, I’m obsessed with perfume and it’s the reason I’m passionate about Comfort Creations. There’s nothing better than coming home to the smell of fragrant laundry, so I think it’s a perfect idea combining fine fragrance with a softening product.

Blonde bombshell: Another WAG who may well be flying out to support husband and England captain Steven is Alex Gerrard

'I still remember the smell of my mum’s laundry and it’s really important for me to create that comforting and memorable experience for my own family.

'I just thought "Why hasn't anyone done this before?" The campaign was girly and floral and reflects my style.'

Other than working with Comfort Creations, Coleen has been busy designing her AW14 range for Littlewoods, which she says is 'coming on well,' and is planning a summer holiday for after the World Cup so the family can relax together.

Another WAG who may well be flying out to support husband and England captain Steven is Alex Gerrard.

Alex told us: 'I'm really not sure if I'm going yet so I haven't even thought about what I would take.'

The mother-of-two did, however, reveal that Steven's healthy lifestyle ahead of the World Cup has been having a positive effect on hers.

She said: 'I eat pretty healthily most
 of the time. Obviously Steven’s diet is really healthy so that 
encourages me to eat well.

'Maybe if I'm going away I would be extra good
 the week before and try not to snack in between meals or eat carbs 
after 6pm.  I train three times a week with my 
trainer Deana Mogan and we do a mixture or cardio and weights and core 
strength. We mix it up so I don't get bored and sometimes if I am being 
really good I may go for a run as well during the week.'

While she and Steven share a healthy lifestyle, the model and columnist says they'd never share her beauty products.

'He knows I love my products so he wouldn’t dare touch them!,' she laughed.

Alex is a huge product junkie but while she may be able to afford the most luxurious lotions and potions on the market, the WAG loves a good budget buy.

'I have lots of budget beauty secrets. I love Vaseline Spray and Go because it's a
 lovely body moisturiser if you’re in a hurry and it absorbs really 
quickly and smells lovely and fresh. It's great for taking away on 
holiday.

Fighting fit: The mother-of-two said that husband Steven's healthy lifestyle ahead of the World Cup has been having a positive effect on hers

'My favourite 
budget beauty gadget is the MICRO Pedi. I use it to keep my feet nice 
and smooth. It’s handy in the summer as I can give myself a quick pedi 
before I head out in my flip flops or sandals. 

'I also love Batiste dry shampoo. It's great for freshening up between washes
 and also if my hair’s feeling a bit flat it's great for adding some 
volume.

'Also, little Vaseline tubs are great. I 
put it on my eyelashes to make them grow and to keep them moisturised. I
 also use it as a quick cheap lip gloss. I always have a little tub in 
my bag,' she said.

Citing her ultimate beauty icon as Kate Moss, who she describes as 'amazing',  Alex says she 'isn't one to have loads of beauty treatments'.

Beauty buff: Alex Gerrard opened up beauty bag for FEMAIL and most of it is budget. The WAG also revealed that she'd love to work in health and fitness

She said: 'I'm not one to have loads of treatments to be honest but probably a spray tan or a hydro facial. I have them every couple of months if I can. It's like a really nice deep clean for your face. Your skin feels so clean and soft afterwards.'

Aside from supporting her husband, Alex has a World Cup column and a fitness blog with Hello! magazine, which she says she 'loves' doing.

Speaking about her future ambitions, she said: 'I would like to do more with health and fitness as I really enjoy it'.
