Let's get ready to rumble! These two tiger cubs are having a rip-roaring time frolicking in a pile of leaves that were waiting for them in their enclosure.

They'll be vicious killers when they grow up but right now these cubs are just like any other house cat... albeit ones with sharper fangs and claws.  

Keepers at DierenPark Amersfoort surprised the three-month-old cubs by filling the pen with fallen leaves in an attempt to get the young tigers to get used to autumn conditions outside. 

Charming fellow: The three-month-old cubs were born in June and ventured outside seven-weeks after  

Gotcha!: Cute cubs have fun the the pile of leaves that the zoo's animal keepers have placed in their enclosure 

Tiger family: Angara gave birth to her first three cubs in June this year. The cubs have yet to meet their father, Ilya, who also lives in the zoo

Animal carer Martijn van der Sijde posted the video on YouTube and wrote: 'Autumn leaves have started to fall and it seemed fun and festive to usher in the first autumn for the cubs by letting them play with the leaves.'

‘It’s one way they can get used to all the leaves that are going to fall once they are outside.’

The zoo’s female tiger, Angara gave birth to her first three cubs in June this year. After seven weeks of being close to their mother, the animals were introduced to the outside world.

‘Now that autumn has begun, the animal keepers surprised the brothers with a lot of leaves. At first they were looking at the leaves in a strange manner as it was a new situation for them but they started playing very soon,’ Lize de Graaf, from the zoo told MailOnline.

The gorgeous baby tigers seem to be having a blast as they roll about on the leaves rambunctiously while their mother paces the length of the room.

The boys are oblivious to her presence, their attention captivated and held by the large pile on the floor.

Things get a bit aggressive at one point as they start roughly patting each other, and even biting, but it’s all fun and games for the boys and they continue with clowning around in glee.

Pinned down: Mum joins in the fun, holds down one cub as the other clambers over her 

The furry bundles of fun don’t seem to tire of their leafy game and continue to playing with wild abandon.

Mum Angara comes over at one point to see what the fuss is all about and they leap on her, feigning attack but she brushes them off easily with her massive paws.

She pins down one of the cubs and starts to play with him as the other cub clambers over her, squeezing his way to the back of the enclosure so that he can make a surprise attack on his brother.

The heartwarming scene continues as the two cubs play while mum relaxes on the leaves

The antics of the cubs, Fedor and Nicolai, and their brother Sergei can be followed on the zoo’s live webcam at www.dierenparkamersfoort.nl/dierenpagina/welpcam.

The boys have yet to meet their father Ilya, who also lives at the zoo but, according to Ms De Graff, plans are afoot to get the little family together.
