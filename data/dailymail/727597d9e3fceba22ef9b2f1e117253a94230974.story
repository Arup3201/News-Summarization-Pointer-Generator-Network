Still got it: North Pond Hermit Christopher 
Knight, 47, in his Kennebec County Jail booking photo, has received a marriage proposal since his arrest

Three decades of sylvan solitude 
haven't done any harm to Christopher Knight's mojo. The North Pond 
Hermit has already received one marriage proposal since his arrest for 
robbery earlier this month.

Despite spending 27 years in the woods
 of Maine with virtually no contact with other people, he's had plenty 
trying to get close to him since bursting onto the headlines, officials 
said.

The offers Knight has received from 
total strangers have prompted authorities to hike his bail by 5,000 per 
cent, out of fears unscrupulous characters may try to exploit him.

Someone called the jail where he's 
being held with a marriage proposal while a man Knight didn't know 
showed up on Saturday night offering to pay his $5,000 bail, The 
Kennebec Journal reported.

Worried Knight could be the target of 
someone looking to capitalise on his notoriety, authorities charged him 
with two additional counts of burglary and theft and increased his bail 
to $250,000.

Maine State Trooper Diane 
Perkins-Vance told the Journal: 'My job is to ensure he does appear in 
court. But there's a lot of people out there trying to exploit him.'

District Attorney Maeghan Maloney said the big bail increase is unusual, but then this is an unusual case.

'The first concern is he might be a 
flight risk,' she said. 'The second concern is the group of people who 
are interested in posting bail for Mr Knight who are not from our state 
and not members of his family.

'I will remain concerned for Mr Knight until he has an attorney helping him to navigate what is a new world to him.'

Police said Knight may have been 
responsible for as many as 1,000 burglaries over the years, raiding 
cottages and campsites for food, cooking gear, sleeping bags, tents and 
other goods to help him survive.

No friends, but lots of stuff: A coffee pot was one of the many items removed from the camp used by Christopher Knight. Other items found included Nintendo Game Boys and high-end sleeping bags

He would have needed it: An L.L. Bean sleeping bag found in Knight's camp. He has told investigators he never lit fires to avoid being detected by the authorities

Taken away: State Trooper Sean Kinney carries a trash can containing one of the tents used by Christopher Knight. Authorities filled two pickups trucks with things as they took apart Knight's camp

Survival tools: Items allegedly used by Knight, known as the North Pond Hermit, are displayed by Maine Department of Public Safety

The 47-year-old was wearing brand-new 
shoes and gloves, all thought to be stolen, when he was caught and as 
officers dismantled his camp they discovered goods including high-end 
L.L. Bean sleeping bags and a new tent.

Officers filled two pickup trucks as 
they took apart Knight's camp last week, later displaying what they were
 calling evidence for locals to sort through to try to recover their 
stolen goods.

There were several Nintendo Game Boys 
and a wristwatch, along with shovels, rakes, coolers, cooking gear, a 
coffee pot and even toilet paper.

Creature comforts: Maine State Police photo shows the makeshift 
camp site of Christopher Knight where he lived for almost three decades 
as a hermit near a pond in central Maine

Well-camouflaged: His tarpaulin-covered camp was so well constructed that it was initially thought Knight might have been a veteran due to his outdoor living skills

Authorities said Knight used logs on 
the ground as a makeshift commode and, at one point, attached an antenna
 to a treetop so he could get better reception on his battery-powered 
TV.

His tarp-covered camp was so well 
constructed that it was initially thought Knight might have been a 
military veteran due to his outdoor living skills.

Going to great lengths to make the 
camp invisible from the air, Knight told Trooper Diane Perkins-Vance 
that he never lit a fire, even on the coldest nights, in case he was 
detected.

He would cover shiny surfaces such as 
his metal trash cans with moss and dirt and painted green a clear 
plastic sheet that covered his tent.

Trooper Perkins-Vance said that his 
camp faced east and west to make best use of the sun and Knight told 
wardens that he had been watching one particular mushroom grow for the 
past four years.

Many locals said they were relieved by
 Knight's arrest after years of break-ins. Before the camp's 
dismantling, some hiked about a mile into the woods with police to try 
to get a look at the hermit's camp.

Knight was arrested after tripping a 
surveillance sensor set up by a game warden while stealing food from a 
camp for people with special needs, authorities said.

Knight pictured in his 1984 school yearbook: Authorities said by the time he was about 19, he'd disappeared into the woods.

In his police mug shot, Knight is clean-shaven, has short-cropped hair and is sporting Eighties-style glasses.

It's
 a different look than in his photo from the 1984 yearbook from Lawrence
 High School in Fairfield, Maine. In that, Knight is wearing horn-rimmed
 glasses and has long, thick dark hair as he leans against a tree.

The
 caption accompanying the picture says Knight's plans were to become a 
computer technician. But authorities said by the time he was about 19, 
he'd disappeared into the woods.

Authorities
 say Knight doesn't show signs of mental illness and they've uncovered 
no other motive for his seclusion except that he wanted to be alone.

Knight is now in the general jail population and is said to be doing well despite his years of isolation.

'He's smiling, pleasant,' said Trooper Perkins-Vance. 'He's a very humble man.'
