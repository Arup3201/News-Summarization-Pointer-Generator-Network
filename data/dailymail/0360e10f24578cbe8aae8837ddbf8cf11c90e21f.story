Google was accused yesterday of ‘doing evil’ by avoiding British taxes.

MPs said the internet search giant – which has the informal motto ‘Don’t be evil’ – used ‘devious, calculated and unethical’ tricks to minimise its liabilities.

Last year its UK turnover was £3billion yet it paid just £7.3million in corporation tax. In stark contrast, families lose more than half of their wages to income tax and national insurance.

Google vice president Matt Brittin floundered during the grilling by MPs, admitting that committee chairman Margaret Hodge knew more about his firm than he did

During heated questioning in the 
Commons yesterday, Labour MP Margaret Hodge asked Google executives: ‘If
you are a hard-pressed family who pay all their taxes, or if you are a 
struggling business who feel very bullied by HMRC and certainly hassled 
by them, how do you think they feel?

‘Every time they switch on to Google 
... it reminds them of your rather devious, if I may say so, calculated 
and in my view unethical behaviour in deliberately manipulating the 
reality of your business to avoid paying your fair share of tax to the 
common good? How do you think ordinary people feel?’

Referring to the ‘Don’t be evil’ 
slogan, Mrs Hodge added: ‘I think you do do evil. That is, you use smoke
and mirrors to avoid paying tax.’

Matt Brittin, a vice-president of Google, had been summoned by MPs for a second time to give evidence.

He was accused of trying to ‘disguise’ the truth with the testimony he gave last November.

Google claims all its sales are made 
in Dublin, rather than in the UK. This allows the firm to pay tax in 
Ireland, which has a corporation tax rate of just 12.5 per cent against 
Britain’s 23 per cent.

Mr Brittin told MPs last November: ‘No one in the UK is selling.’

Furious: Committee chairman Margaret Hodge warned Mr Britten that misleading Parliament was a 'very serious offence' as she accused him of being 'devious'

During more than an hour of intense questions, exasperated MPs called on Mr Britten to 'call a spade a spade' and give straight answers to their questions

But MPs said new evidence suggests almost 70 per cent of Google’s sales revenues come from deals that have involved UK staff.

Those staff are largely paid by commission and have monthly ‘sales’ targets – suggesting they are in fact selling in the UK.

MPs said they had been contacted by a ‘stream of whistleblowers’ and had seen invoices sent out from British addresses.

Mrs Hodge, who chairs the public 
accounts committee, said she had seen a presentation given to UK staff 
giving sales targets for 2012.

‘It was quite clear from all that 
documentation that the entire trading process and sales process took 
place in the UK,’ she said.

During a two-hour interrogation, Mr Brittin eventually admitted that ‘a lot of the aspects of selling’ do take place in the UK.

But he insisted all sales were processed and billed in Ireland.

He said: ‘Literally 99 per cent of our UK customers spend their money without ever talking to anyone in Google UK.’

But the remaining 1 per cent are the group’s largest customers, and account for more than two thirds of its total sales.

Labour leader Ed Milliband said people would be 'shocked' by Google's tax arrangements while Business Secretary Vince Cable said 'public outrage' was justified

He added: ‘Customers may feel they 
are being sold to ...but there’s a difference between that and closing 
the deals and money changing hands.’

Tory MP Richard Bacon told Mr 
Brittin: ‘They thought they were being sold to, because they were. Why 
don’t you call a spade a spade?’

When Mrs Hodge accused Google of 
being ‘evil’, Mr Brittin said: ‘Tax is not a matter of choice. Tax is a 
matter of following the laws that are there internationally and that is 
what we do.’

Yesterday Business Secretary Vince Cable accused Google of being ‘amoral’.

He said: ‘If you are a small company 
which can’t relocate overseas and has to pay a lot of tax, I can 
understand why people are absolutely furious.

‘They’re looking for us in 
government, quite rightly, to close any loopholes, but, more important, 
we’ve got to get a proper system of international rules so that people 
are operating in a consistent way across national boundaries.’

During one farcical exchange, John Dixon (Left) from accountants Ernst and Young, refused to talk about Google's tax arrangements to protect client 'confidentiality' despite sitting next to his client

A Google spokesman said: ‘As we have always said, we fully comply with all of the tax rules in the UK.

‘We stand behind Matt Brittin’s 
testimony over the course of two sessions in front of Parliament, and we
disagree with the committee’s view of our tax structure.’

Lin Homer, chief executive of HMRC, 
who also gave evidence, said she sympathised with the widespread public 
outrage at the low taxes paid by many corporations.

The row comes amid growing unease over the sweetheart deals agreed between HM Revenue & Customs and big companies.

Yesterday, UK Uncut lost its High 
Court battle against Goldman Sachs, which the campaign group claimed had
been let off a £20million tax bill.

But, while ruling that the deal was 
not unlawful, Mr Justice Nicol said ‘the settlement with Goldman Sachs 
was not a glorious episode in the history of the Revenue’.
