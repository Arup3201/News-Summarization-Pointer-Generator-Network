A pair of rotting corpses have been found inside an abandoned funeral home two years after it was shut down for not cremating bodies.

One of the bodies has been identified as that of Marshall Lee Allen, who died of pneumonia in 2011 aged 63.

His daughter, Kimberly Wall, says the experince of trying to track down her father's remains for almost three years has sent her 'to hell and back.'

Two bodies have been found inside a funeral home in North Carolina two years after it was shut down when clients complained remains were not being returned to them

The bodies were discovered after former owner Mary McLendon admitted in court on Wednesday that there was a body inside the shuttered property

Speaking to Wsoctv, she said she spent $1,500 on a viewing and cremation service for Allen at McLendon Funeral Home, but his remains were never returned to her.

Police eventually tracked the body down after the home's former owner, Mary McLendon, admitted in court on Wednesday that there was still a corpse inside the property.

Officers found one body wrapped in blankets inside a casket, before unexpectedly discovering another lying on a table, which has yet to be identified.

Ms Wall said: 'You can't explain it. This is something I wouldn't wish on nobody. She destroyed so many lives that you can't fit back together.'

McLendon 
Funeral Home was closed in 2012 after clients complained that McLendon 
was taking payments for cremations and burial services without 
performing them.

When police raided the home on that occasion, they found three bodies left inside.

McLendon has been sentenced to between 6 and 17 months in jail after being found guilty of obtaining property by false pretenses

One of them was Richard Bennett, who had died five months before his body was found, authorities said at the time.

McLendon was sentenced to 6 to 17 months in prison at Anson County court for obtaining property by false pretenses.

Speaking about the trial, Wall added: 'I wish she could have been charged with murder or something because she killed a part of me when she did that.'

Wsoctv also claims that McLendon had a history of violations dating back to 2006, including changing dates on death certificates, using funeral funds for her own use, and failing to refund clients.

In 2010, deputies found another three dead bodies inside the funeral home that weren't properly disposed of.
