A farmer was left shocked when he discovered one of his hens had laid a huge 3in-tall egg.

Simon Broomfield heard some strange squawking coming from the chicken shed and spotted the massive specimen when he went to investigate.

The tennis-ball sized egg was three times the size of all the others that had been laid alongside it.

Chicken farmer Richard Dickson was amazed when he discovered a huge egg laid by prize hen Doris this week

Simon took the incredible egg to farm owner Richard Dickson, who weighed it at a hefty six ounces.

He said he had never seen one so large despite owning chickens for 26 years.

It is thought a Lohmann Brown hen called Doris was responsible for the whopper, as she was seen to be gingerly walking around the barn later that day.

Simon put the egg in a wine glass for safety and Richard is planning to preserve it by draining away the yolk and white and keeping the shell.

Richard, an organic egg producer and owner of Wick Farm in Downton, Salisbury, who feeds his hens on seed and grain, said: 'Simon was collecting the eggs and came across this huge one.

'He brought it to me and said "have a look at this" and I thought it was exceptionally large.

'We weighed it and it was 169 grams (six ounces) which is giant compared to a normal egg, itâ€™s about three times bigger.

'Doris is 22-weeks-old and when chickens are young they can often produce bigger eggs until they get the hang of it.

'But I have been in commercial egg production since 1986 and I have never seen one that big.

'I put it in a wine glass as that was the nearest thing I could find to keep it safe and I am now planning to blow it out.'
