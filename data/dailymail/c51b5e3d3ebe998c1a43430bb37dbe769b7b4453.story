Jagger, pictured, died the night after winning a silver medal at Crufts following his return to Belgium

The pedigree dog allegedly ‘murdered’ at Crufts was probably poisoned the day after he competed in the show, the vet investigating his death said yesterday.

Irish setter Jagger collapsed and died the night after winning a silver medal in his class at the competition following his return to his co-owners’ family home in Belgium.

His distraught owners Willem and Aleksandra Lauwers are convinced he was fed beef laced with slow-acting toxins as he sat on the bench awaiting to perform at Crufts as it was the only time he was left unattended.

But their family vet Dr Patrick Jans said Jagger fell ill so suddenly that it is more likely he ate the toxins shortly before he died.

Speaking for the first time about the tragedy, he told the Mail: ‘I doubt that it happened at Crufts. I think it’s unlikely because of the long time delay.

‘I am surprised at everyone saying that this was the case.’

The dramatic new twist came as Crufts organisers the Kennel Club confirmed they are looking into a report that a second dog, an unnamed shih tzu, also died following the event.

But they stressed they have received no details about the shih tzu, saying: ‘We cannot look into claims about which we have no direct information, which is why it essential that people come forward with any concerns.’

The Lauwers phoned Dr Jans’ practice at 2am on Saturday morning after Jagger fell ill soon after they had taken him for a walk in the area around their home in the village of Lauw, near Liege.

Dr Jans said: ‘There was some suspicious content in the stomach.

‘I would be cautious about suspicion on where the problem was caused. Everything about Crufts is speculation.

‘It could have happened on their way back or even in the hours after they arrived back.

‘They told us that they came back at night and they took the dogs for a walk to do their business.

‘Then a few moments later the problem started.

‘It was a very long time between the show in England and the trip over to here, where nothing wrong was seen with the dog.

‘We feel his death was very acute - it was something that happened quite urgently, quite quickly.

‘I have my doubts about the story from Crufts.’

An autopsy carried out by his colleague Dr Claudia Minsen discovered miniscule black pellets similar to those used by farmers apparently ‘folded’ into pieces of beef in his stomach.

Dr Jans said: ‘There were not three different types of poison as some people have speculated - only one. We think it may have been a pesticide.

‘Those kind of products are very common in agriculture and are relatively easy to get hold of.’

Vets believe that Jagger, pictured, was fed beef laced with black pellets before his death 

Dr Jans said he had sent samples to the toxology department at the University of Ghent who are expected to report their findings early next week.

He said: ‘It depends on the product, but I think when we have an indication of what product it was, then we can see a time scale of when things happened.

‘We informed the police of what we found.

‘They are taking it seriously and have informed the neighbourhood.’

Dr Minsen, who conducted the autopsy on the dog, said: ‘The meat seemed to be beef. There were little black pellets in it.

‘They were really, really tiny and there were a lot of them. They looked like agricultural pellets.

‘They weren’t injected into the meat, they were just folded into it.

‘I do believe it was put in deliberately but it could have been an accident.’

But speaking from her family home yesterday, Mrs Lauwers said: ‘It didn’t happen in Belgium – I am 100 per cent sure it happened in England.

‘We are convinced it happened there.

‘The CCTV from Crufts is being checked by someone we know.

‘I am convinced it didn’t happen here as my dog was 100 per cent attended.’

The revelations came as Jagger was cremated yesterday at a special centre for family pets twenty miles from the family home.

The Lauwers brought his ashes home and plan to spread them in the coming weeks in woods near their home where he liked to walk.

They also plan to spread some of his ashes in Kilby, Leicestershire where he was born and his British co-owner Dee Milligan-Bott runs a kennel.

A further four dogs – two Shetland Sheepdogs, an Afghan and a West Highland Terrier - are also feared to have been poisoned at Crufts.

But Kennel Club Secretary Caroline Kisko said: ‘Whilst reports surrounding the welfare of dogs at Crufts are taken with the utmost of seriousness, a number of the reports in the news about dogs becoming sick after leaving the show have been from anonymous sources, who have not reported the allegations to us or the police, and we cannot look into claims about which we have no direct information.

‘We urge these people and anybody else who may have similar concerns to come forward and report them to the Kennel Club.’

Anyone ‘caught attempting to deliberately sabotage another competitor’s performance, particularly if a dog’s welfare is put at risk’ will face severe disciplinary action and could be prosecuted under the Animal Welfare Act, she added.

Andreas Schemel, the show's chief vet, said yesterday that it would be difficult to stop a poisoner if they wanted to commit a criminal act.

And William Jeffels, another of the vets at the NEC in Birmingham, said dogs which they had treated for gastro-intestinal conditions could have been 'the victims of skullduggery'.
