How do you put a sentence on a life sentence is the question being asked by Liam Knight and his family.

In January last year, Liam was speared through the head with a metal pole by a teenage gatecrasher at an 18th birthday party in Sydney and on Friday, his attacker was sentenced to at least eight years.

'For me it's going to be a life sentence,' he told Channel 9's 60 Minutes when asked if the sentence was fair. 'For him to have eight years - I was hoping for more.'

'The fact that he did it when he was underage, you can't expect him to get too much.'

Yet Liam is already looking to the future and said he was focused on getting his White Knight Foundation running and raising money for it.

'Our aim is to help victims of youth violence and raise awareness of gatecrashing,' he said.

Liam said the foundation's aim was to help victims through their recovery.

'I've had a lot of help from the community, the community has helped me that much that I want to give back to them,' he said.

Liam was one of about 70 guests celebrating the 18th birthday of his friend Harry Staples in Forestville in Sydney's north when things went horribly wrong.

Liam said two girls at the party invited the gatecrashers to the party

The then 16-year-old, who can only be called DS for legal reasons, gatecrashed the party with four other young men only to be told they were not on the guest list, and unwelcome.

Liam said the trial had been a 'full on' experience given he is still a teenager. 'I didn't expect myself to be in this position,' he said.

Of his attacker's previous nine prior criminal convictions including resisting police and assault, Liam said he was 'trouble'.

'He's a bad cookie. He should have been locked up before then,' he said.

The attacker breached bail on the night he gatecrashed the party and speared Liam.

'He shouldn't have even been there - I don't know how stupid you can get to actually break bail that many times and think you can get away with it,' he said. 'So he's not the smartest man around.'

Liam explained that two girls at the party sent the address and invited DS and other young men to attend.

'Just trying to make a reputation for himself with his mates and look where it's ended, he's in jail and I'm in a state that I'll be in for the rest of my life.'

Once at the party DS scaled a high fence at the home and climbed onto the roof of a shed, shouting to his mates, 'come on, we can come through this way'.

Harry Staples' father, Phillip Staples, shone a torch on DS and said: 'Mate, you're not invited, you have to leave.'

Angry and intoxicated, DS pushed Mr Staples in the chest, and punched one of the party guests in the face. Then he began throwing building materials at partygoers.

One of four steel three-metre bars that he threw into the crowd pierced Liam's skull and lodged in his head.

Paramedics arrived on the scene and sedated Knight, but had to wait for firefighters to cut the large piece of steel protruding from his head, before they took the young man to hospital.

In Royal North Shore Hospital, Knight underwent a five hour emergency bilateral craniectomy.

Liam said he thanked doctors for the fact he survived and was 'still here'.

Of his recovery, the teenager said physically he had improved a lot in the last year-and-a-half and that the paralysis on his left side was getting better but had 'plateaued'. 'Obviously sometimes I get down still,' he said.

Extreme harm: Liam Knight, pictured leaving Downing Centre Court following the sentencing of his attacker, suffered an 'extreme' degree of harm in the 'catastrophic' steel pole assault in January last year, said Judge Ronald Solomon, which left Knight with permanent injuries and his future life 'in tatters'

Plans shattered: Liam, pictured leavibng the Downing Centre Court on Friday afternoon, told the court last month in a pre-sentencing hearing that the metal pole attack by the teenager known as DS, 'changed my whole life. For the simple fact that he could not get into a party, my life as it was before the injury is gone. I nearly lost my life numerous times that night. The future I had planned has gone

Liam said the attack had robbed him of the chance to celebrate social events during his last year of school and also surfing and rugby.

'I used to just go out the back, sit there, just chill out, clear my head,' he said and added that although he misses it, music is his 'escape' now.

The teenager said he was slowly getting his freedom back since he started driving. 'I'm loving it,' he said. 'I would always have to wait for my mates to come pick me up and if they couldn't take me I'd sit here on the couch after doing physio.'

His mother Mary said there were no winners or losers following the life-changing attack but reiterated Liam's sentiments about the challenges of sentencing someone who has given another a 'life sentence'. 'I have mixed feelings,' she said.

Despite remaining positive throughout his recovery, Liam admitted there were times he was angry about what happened to him and being left in a position where he should not be.

'There's moments I remember I broke down, before the court started and they warned me about what he could get and that's when I just kind of broke down and said: "Well I've got a life sentence on me so why shouldn't he?",' he said.

However his mother said it was devastating to see her young son not to be able to do his shoelaces or tie. 'That's embarrassing for him,' she said.

'But then I look at him from where he was to where he is now, he's come such a long way... he's amazing.

'I don't think I know anyone that has such a positive attitude towards to what's happened to him.

'He's got a special quality about him... he brings tears to my eyes.'

Pole assault victim Liam Knight (pictured, right, alighting from the vehicle) arrives at the Downing Centre Court on Friday for the sentencing of the teenager who threw a steel rod at his head, permanently injuring Knight who said his life has been ruined by the attack

The teenager who threw a three metre metal pole into a party crowd in January last year, piercing the skull of Liam Knight(pictured, left) and leaving him with permanent injuries has received a minimum eight year sentence for his crime

Angry and intoxicated: The teenager, then aged 16 years, arrived at party in Forestville in Sydney's north in January last year where Liam Knight was one of about 70 guests celebrating the 18th birthday of Harry Staples  when things went horribly wrong.
The teen, known as DS, gatecrashed the party and scaled a high fence at the home and climbed onto the roof of a shed. Then he threw four three-metre bars into the crowd, piercing Liam's skull

Last month, the court heard the attack had left Knight's life 'in tatters'.

In sentencing DS to a maximum of 12 years and six months over the attack on Friday, acting Judge Ronald Solomon told Sydney's District Court that the consequences for Liam were 'catastrophic'.

The pole pierced Knight's skull and came out the other side, leaving him with permanent brain injuries that he said would prevent him from surfing, playing rugby and perhaps even running again.

'The degree of violence perpetrated by the offender was high and the degree of harm extreme,' Judge Solomon said.

'DS has changed my whole life for the simple fact that he couldn't get into a party,' Liam told the court during DS's sentence hearing in June.

'My family should never have heard the words "your child has been seriously injured and may not live",' Liam said in a victim impact statement read by his brother to the court on Friday.

'I nearly lost my life numerous times that night.

'DS changed my whole life. For the simple fact that he could not get into a party. My life as it was before the injury is gone. The future I had planned has gone.'
