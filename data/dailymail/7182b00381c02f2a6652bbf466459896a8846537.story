Actors Tom Cruise, John Travolta and Kelly Preston were in attendance yesterday as thousands of Scientologists gathered in Clearwater, Florida for the dedication of their new $145million 'cathedral'.

The 377,000-square-foot Flag Building is the tallest building in downtown Clearwater, and has been in construction for nearly 15 years. The opening of the building will mark the first time Scientologists have a place to practice the 'Super Power' program, developed by the religion's founder L Ron Hubbard in the 1970s.

While the city was told to expect 10,000 Scientologists this weekend, the crowd gathered outside the Flag Building yesterday was noticeably smaller. The Tampa Bay Times estimated that numbers could have been less than 6,000.

The ceremony was for parishioners only but even born-and-bred Scientologists couldn't get into the exclusive dedication ceremony.

Danielle Lumberg is a third-generation Scientologist who belongs to the church in Clearwater, but wasn't allowed past the thick security surrounding the new buidling.

Instead, she stood outside the event and tried to get as good a look at the new building as possible.

'It sounds like Disney World in there,' she told the Tampa Bay Tribune.

Headquarters: The $145m building reportedly will be the only place where a highly classified Super Power program, first advanced by church founder L. Ron Hubbard in the 1970s, will be conducted

But she didn't seem to hold any grudge against the church for not letting her into the event.

'Thank God it's finally done,' she said. 'There are so many more people joining the church we really needed more space so we could be more comfortable and do more things for the community, and the response today is absolutely breathtajing. We've been looking forward to this for a long, long time.'

Brad Kugler is a second-generation Scientologist from nearby Palm Harbor and he too wasn't allowed into the ceremony.

Mr Kugler climbed a palm tree just for a better vantage point into the ceremony.

'I've been watching this come out of the ground for the better part of 15 years. It's huge,' he told the Tampa Bay Times. 

After a quick eight-minute speech by Scientology's leader David Miscavige, confetti-rained down and the cathedral's doors were opened to the thousands gathered outside.

But for non-church members excluded on the outside, the building's opening was not a celebration. Around four people were seen protesting the event in Guy Fawkes masks, while other locals weren't happy at the religion's takeover of the city.

Tight security: Many people weren't allowed into the event to watch the unveiling. But they didn't mind. Danielle Lumberg said: 'Thank God it's done, we need more space'

Huge crowds: Thousands of Scientologists were there to see the opening of the building which has been under construction for 15 years

 The Super Power course was developed by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard and  promises to boost a person's perceptions or senses through a series of mental and physical tasks.Scientologists believe that in addition to the five senses of hearing, sight, touch, taste and smell we have 57 additional abilities known as 'perceptics'.These include an ability to sense blood circulation, balance, compass direction, temperature, gravity as well as an 'awareness of importance, unimportance.' In his writings Hubbard described the course as: 'A superfantastic, but confidential series of rundowns that can be done on anyone whether Dianetic clear or not that puts the person into fantastic shape unleashing the super power of a thetan.'This is the means that puts Scientologists into a new realm of ability enabling them to create the new world. It puts world clearing within reach in the future.'It consists of 12 separate high-power rundowns which are brand-new and enter realms of the tech never before approached.'Hubbard had originally wanted to offer the course in 1978 but many of his staff who had been through the instructor training left the church on completion of the course.In a written statement, church spokesman Ben Shaw said: 'Super Power is a series of spiritual counseling processes designed to give a person back his own viewpoint, increase his perception, exercise his power of choice, and greatly enhance other spiritual abilities.'

'People don't want to come to downtown
 Clearwater because that's all you see — big groups (of Scientologists) 
walking everywhere. Downtown Clearwater could be a really interesting, 
vibrant place,' said Debbie Halvorsen, 62, of Largo.

Mo
 Iskander would disagree. The local restauranteur sees the center's 
opening as a money-making opportunity. He opened his new restaurant Mixx
 Bar and Bar and Grill yesterday as well and aims to bring in 
Scientology parishioners.

'The
 church will play a big part in bringing attractions, festivals and 
nightlife to the downtown area, and we're just the first,' he said. 'The
 Scientologists are always well dressed, they look nice, and they keep 
our city a nice place. And they need to eat, too.'

The group broke ground on the Mediterranean Revival-style  building in 1998, but stopped work after finishing the shell.

For
 three years, the group ceased construction on the project until the 
city started imposing $250-a-day fines for code violations.

Scientology
 defectors have explained that the building's slow construction is due 
to church leader's who have allegedly used the project as a fundraising cash cow.

An analysis by the Tampa Bay Times discovered that the church had raised $145million for the building, much higher than the $100million it was estimated to cost.

Former Scientologist couple Rocio and Luis Garcia of Irvine, California contributed more than $340,000 to the construction of the Super Power building, before ultimately suing the church in federal court for dragging out the project 'as a shill'.

Church representatives have described the Garcia's suit as 'frivolous'.

While the new building is part of a larger complex of buildings that serve as a spiritual retreat for Scientologists, there will be space on the ground floor for visitors to learn about the religion.

The visitor center will have a 'grand lobby' with a three-story atrium and exhibits that explain the religion's belief system and practices.

The second and third floors are home to offices and classrooms while the basement houses a huge kitchen and dining areas.

Three hundred small rooms for 'auditing' can be found on the buildings upper floors. Auditing is the religions form of counseling and a session can cost $1,000.

But the jewel in the crown of the Flag Building is on the fifth floor, where members can pariticapte in the Super Power program for the first time.

The Super Power program was developed by the religion's found L Ron Hubbard and described as one of his greatest discoveries.

'Super Power is a series of spiritual counseling processes designed to give a person back his own viewpoint, increase his perception, exercise his power of choice, and greatly enhance other spiritual abilities,' church spokesman Ben Shaw said in a statement.

Hubbard went further in his description of the program saying: 'Super Power is the answer to a sick, a dying and dead society...With it we literally revive the dead.'

As part of that therapy, members will be spun on an anit-gravity simulator blindfolded to improve their 'perceptics' - Hubbard's 57 senses which include sight, smell, taste, blood circulation, and awareness of awareness.

Another interesting feature of the building is the circular running track located on floor six.

Scientologists use the track for 'Cause Resurgence Rundown'. Basically they run until they have a moment of enlightenment called 'cognition'.
