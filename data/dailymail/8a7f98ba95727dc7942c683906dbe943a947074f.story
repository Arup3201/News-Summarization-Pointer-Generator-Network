A crew member and two contractors died when a fire broke out aboard a luxury cruise ship docked at the eastern Caribbean island of St Lucia yesterday morning.

The 656 passengers and 400 crew members aboard the Oceania Insignia were evacuated safely and the remainder of the cruise was cancelled, according to operators Oceania Cruises.

One crew member, from the Philippines, remains in hospital in a stable condition after the fire broke out at around 8.30am.

A fire broke out in the engine room of the Oceana Insignia, though it is not yet known what caused the blaze 

But a fellow crew member, also from the Philippines, and two contractors died in a local hospital after being caught up in the blaze, which began in the engine room and was contained.

Jason Lasecki, senior director of public relations for Prestige Cruise Holdings, the parent company of Oceania Cruises, said it is not yet clear what caused the fire. 

He said: 'We are deeply saddened by the tragic events that occurred on Insignia.'

'We have extended our heartfelt condolences to the families of those involved and are offering them our full support. 

'This is truly an emotional time for all of us at Oceania Cruises. We are grateful there are no other crew injuries.'

Passengers will be fully refunded and charter flights have been arranged to take them to Miami, where accommodation will be found for them until they can be flown home.

The liner was docked in St Lucia, to where passengers and crew were evacuated following the fire

Oceania's president and chief operating officer Jason Montague and other officials are in St Lucia. 

The Foreign Office said it was aware of the incident but no British nationals were among the dead.

It is not known how many of the ship's passengers were British. 

The US National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending officials to help with the investigation, which was being led by the Marshall Islands, where the ship is registered.

St Lucia police declined to comment, and the island's fire officials could not be reached for comment.

The Insignia had departed San Juan, Puerto Rico, on Sunday for a 10-day cruise and was scheduled to arrive in Miami on December 17.

The ship was built in 1998 and underwent a multimillion-dollar refurbishing earlier this year.

It rejoined the Oceania fleet in May after operating as a charter for two years, according to Oceania.
