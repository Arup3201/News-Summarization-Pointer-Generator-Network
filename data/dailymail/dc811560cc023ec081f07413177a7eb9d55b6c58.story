It has been called Britain's most vulgar car - and now it could be yours for a six-figure sum.

Student Daria Radionova is selling her bling-on-wheels Mercedes CLS 350 encrusted with one million Swarovski crystals just three weeks after it came to the world's attention.

Bidding for the testament to pointless excess has reached £153,800, with 25 car enthusiasts of questionable taste vying for the chance to drive it home.

Yet while boasting that the car would be sold for charity - only ten per cent of the final sale price will support Manchester & Cheshire Dogs' Home which was destroyed by fire, she has revealed.

'The car is now for sale in the eBay charity auction,' said the 21 year old ethnic Russian millionaire whose family live in Moldova, Europe's poorest country.

Garish: This Mercedes CLS 350 is covered with a million Swarovski crystals costing £20,000. Now its London-based Russian student owner is selling it on eBay. Bids have reached £153,800.

Bling: The car - an early gift from her parents for her 21st birthday - also has an elite number plate 'BAII BYY'

The eBay listing for the sparkly luxury car. It was first unveiled three weeks ago and is now up for grabs

'A part from the sale will go to support Manchester and Moldova Dog Homes.'

The London-based student, who lives 300 feet from her favourite shop Harrods, boasted before putting the silver-coloured coupe on sale: 'When I sell the car I will give the money to charity.'

It was not clear last night if any other causes would benefit from the glittering car which was valued at around £25,000.

Daria disputed this, stating: 'The car cost at least £50,000, then I spent over £20,000 on the Swarovski crystals for it.

'It cost me another £15,000 to fly in my team from Russia to put them on the car for me.

'They spent 12 hours a day for two months doing it. I'm very happy with it - everywhere I go, people look at it.'

The car - an early gift from her parents for her 21st birthday - also has an elite number plate BAII BYY.

Magnet for theft: Daria Radionova said: 'It's quite scary to leave it in the street. People try to take the crystals. Every time I come back I have to check if any have gone'

The registration was a present from her brother 'to make sure my car was extra-unique'.

The eBay site says the starting bid was for £89,999.00 - and the auction will end of 16 October. It has not attracted any bids so far.

Daria had also said that any auction profit from her gleaming car would go to a charity 'to help homeless people'.

Asked on Facebook why she was helping dogs rather than children, orphans or disabled people, she snapped back: 'Help them yourself.'

Any buyers should be ready for unexpected attention with a car that has had two previous owners and 57,000 miles on the clock.

'It's quite scary to leave it in the street,' she said.

'People try to take the crystals. Every time I come back I have to check if any have gone.

'But I enjoy it. I know some people say negative things but I don't care what people think.'

The car garnered attention world-wide, including from sitcom star Ashton Kutcher
