British vets have saved the sight of a blind lemur after conducting a first-of-its-kind operation on the animal to remove cataracts.

Keepers at Durrell Wildlife Park in Jersey first noticed Sam, a four-year-old red-fronted brown lemur, had inflamed eyes in January - and within weeks he had been blinded by cataracts in both eyes.

The normally social animal was left unable to interact with his troupe and had to use his memory to navigate round his cage, until he became trapped up a tree and had to be rescued.

Full recovery: Sam, a red-fronted brown lemur, can now see again and is mingling with other animals

Distressed keepers called on the help of the British Animal Health Trust (AHT), whose vets have previously saved the sight of elephants, bears, lions and eagles.

In the first operation of its kind on a lemur, vets Claudia Hartley and Rachael Grundon flew from the mainland and spent two hours painstakingly removing the cataracts last month.

Just six weeks later, Sam has made a remarkable recovery and is once again socialising with other primates at the animal park, including his parents Matz and Millie.

Senior keeper Sian Jones said: 'One morning we noticed he had a swollen eye and the pupil was massively dilated.

'We monitored him and sent for help but over the next couple of weeks we were literally watching him going blind, which was very upsetting.

Examination: The vets had to put Sam under general anaesthetic to examine his eye so he would remain still

Pioneering: The vets work on the lemur during the surgery six weeks ago, from which he has now recovered

Endangered: Lemurs are native only to Madagascar and are at increasing risk of extinction through habitat loss

'He was trying to use his memory to negotiate his way round the cage and eventually he got stuck up a tree, so we had to help him down and lock him in his enclosure to keep him safe.

'At first we didn't know what was happening to him because he was so young - lemurs live for 25 years, and almost all documented cases happen in much older lemurs.'

Up and about: Sam the lemur after recovery

With some similarities to cataract 
surgery on humans, the vets had to look through a microscope to carry 
out the operation using tiny instruments.

They made a 3mm incision into the lemur's eyes and cut out a small piece of the outside skin of the lens in each one, before liquifying it and 'sucking' it out using ultrasound, the surgeons said.

Claudia Hartley, head of ophthalmology at the AHT, said: 'There is nothing quite like the feeling of restoring sight to an animal - especially witnessing them see again for the first time. It really is the best job in the world.

'We were all quite nervous before the surgery and it was really important we got it right.'

Andrew Routh, Durrellâ€™s head 
veterinarian, added: 'We approached Claudia and Rachael of the AHT as they
 specialise in animal ophthalmology and have considerable expertise in 
this very specific type of surgery.

'The
 AHT also provided the specialist equipment required for the surgery 
including a phacoemulsification machine and operating microscope.'

Durrell has been working with the 
striking-looking primates for at least 50 years.

They are native only to Madagascar 
where they are at risk of extinction in some areas due to 
habitat destruction, hunting and trapping for food and the pet trade.

There are 106 known species of lemur, but 90 are classified as being near extinction because their numbers are so small.

Despite being a national symbol to many, the animals are the most hunted in Madagascar.
