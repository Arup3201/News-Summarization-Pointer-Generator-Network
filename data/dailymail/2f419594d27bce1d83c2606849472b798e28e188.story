They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

But for one man from northern China, this was not the case.

Earlier this year, Jian Feng, divorced and sued his wife for being ugly.

Before and after: Jian Feng's wife spent US$100,000 on plastic surgery before she got married

He won his case and was awarded a little under £75,000 by the judge, Fox 31 reported.

Mr Feng said he took issue with his wife’s looks only after the couple’s daughter was born.

He was shocked by the child’s appearance, calling her ‘incredibly ugly’ and saying she looked like neither one of her parents.

Mr Feng was so outraged that he initially accused his wife of cheating.

Faced with the accusation, his wife admitted to spending around £62,000 on plastic surgery which had altered her appearance drastically.

She had the work done before she met her husband and never told him about it after they met.

Mr Feng filed for divorce saying his wife had deceived him and convinced him to marry her under false pretenses.

The judge agreed with him and awarded him the damages.
