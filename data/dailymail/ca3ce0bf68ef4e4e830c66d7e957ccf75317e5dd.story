The streets of Boston were filled with overexcited fans following the Red Sox World Series win but the police seem to have a handle on the situation.

Seven people were arrested for unruly behavior and the Boston Police Department used their Twitter feed as a way to send a stern warning them: ‘don’t be number 8’.

That edict was believed to be broken shortly after 1am with new reports that a mob of revelers overturned a parked vehicle, and the police later updated that count to include nine people before telling Twitter followers to '#GoHome #CelebrateResponsibly'.

Crowd control: Thousands of fans filled the streets of Boston to celebrate the first home-game World Series win for the Red Sox since 1918

Potential disaster: The crowds of people made it difficult for police to control the area but they were out in full force, lining the sidewalks in preparation

In spite of the low arrest count, spectators on the streets reported massive crowds of people who were starting to make mayhem but were eventually stopped by police who arrived at the last second.

Boston Globe reporter Billy Baker was constantly updating his Twitter feed from Boylston Street and he describe the scene at the landmark spot of the Marathon finish line where two pressure cooker bombs went off killing three and injuring hundreds just months ago.

‘As far as I can see, mob scene on Boylston is over. Was tense, and took police a long while to make way to marathon finish, but it’s over,’ he wrote just after 1am.

In the minutes immediately following the Red Sox’s blowout 6-1 finish against the St Louis Cardinals, there was little order and a sense of possible violence.

Not messing around: Security has been higher in the city following the April bombing at the marathon finish line

Ready to roll: Groups of police officers were using bikes to get around the city so that it would be easier to get through the mobs than if they were in patrol cars

 ‘We now have a definite mob at marathon finish line. Getting thicker by minute. Starting to feel unruly. Street blocked. No cops here,’ Baker wrote shortly after midnight.

‘Young guys really beating on cars now. Tender scene at marathon finish line has been taken over by bros with beers. Still no police.’

The crowds apparently did start back up, however, as two other local reporters both showed pictures of an overturned car on that same street and WFXT uploaded a video.

Boston Globe reporter Martine Powers said that one person was arrested following the overturned vehicle, ‘but it was actually for a guy throwing bottles at police/crowds, others dispersed’.

Different lineup: Local officials encouraged the die hard fans to 'celebrate responsibly' after the game

Revelry: Many of the crowds of people chanted the hometown slogan of 'Boston Strong' that has long been used for the baseball team but took on deeper meaning following the bombings in April

There were some other violent altercations further afield as campus police at the University of New Hampshire used pepper spray to break up a mob of unruly students who were celebrating after the landmark win.

Boston police and local officials had a reason to be afraid of chaos as the city has seen violence break out following home team celebrations in the past.

When the Red Sox last won the World Series in 2004 while out of town, a 21-year-old college student was killed after being shot by policeman with a pepper pellet.

More recently, a 22-year-old died after being taken into custody by police during the Celtics NBA celebration.

Happy night: The Red Sox beat the St Louis Cardinals in the sixth game of the series on Wednesday night

The police and Mayor Thomas Menino were careful to try to enforce the peace without taking the fun out of the celebration, as Wednesday’s win was the first time that the baseball team has won the league’s highest title in their beloved home stadium of Fenway Park since 1918.

‘Get the ducks ready, we’re having a parade! Please, be responsible and let’s celebrate! Thank you @RedSox. #bostonstrong,’ the outgoing Mayor tweeted.

The police department tried launching their own hashtag- #CelebrateResponsibly- and encouraged fans to ‘engage in championship behavior off the field’.
