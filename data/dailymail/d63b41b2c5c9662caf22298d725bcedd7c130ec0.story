David Cameron lit a candle in memory of the millions of Holocaust victims as he made his first visit to the Auschwitz concentration camp.

The Prime Minister said he wanted to come to the site to see for himself where the 'darkest chapter of human history' took place.

And he said: 'We must never forget all those who were murdered here'.

Mr Camerno travelled to the notorious site in Poland on his return from a visit to Turkey yesterday

Mr Cameron honoured a pledge made last year to tour the camp in Poland, where more than a million died at the hands of the Nazi regime.

The Prime Minister spent more than an hour in the two main camps which make up the site. Mr Cameron said: 'It is a reminder of why the UK must fight against prejudice, persecution, anti-semitism and tyranny wherever we find it and stand up for inclusiveness, tolerance and peace.' 

He visited a gas chamber, outside which he signed a book of condolence for the victims. Mr Cameron wrote: 'I wanted to come and see for myself this place where the darkest chapter of human history happened.

'Words cannot describe the horror that took place - making it even more important that we never forget.'

Mr Cameron called for a zero tolerance of anti-semitism as he described his 'overwhelming sense of grief' following his first visit to Auschwitz

In his message, Mr Cameron wrote: 'Words cannot describe the horror that took place - making it even more important that we never forget.'

In a message in the book of remembrance, the PM said: 'I wanted to come here to seefor myself where the darkest chapter in our history transpired.

'Words cannot describe the horror that took place - making it even more important that we never forget. 

'As Elie Wiesel said, failing to remember those who were murdered would be akin to killing them all over again.

'The survivors have done so much to tell us about what took place. 

'Today they are becoming fewer in number so I hope the Holocaust Commission we have established will teach future generations what took place - and that we must never forget all those who were murdered here and at other camps and at other places.

'We must always remember what happened.' 

He added: 'As Elie Wiesel said, failing to remember those who were murdered would be akin to failing them all over again.

'The survivors here have so much to tell us about what took place. Today they are becoming fewer in number so I hope the Holocaust Commission we have established will teach future generations what took place and that we must never forget all those who were murdered here and at other camps and in other places.

'We must always remember what happened.'

Mr Cameron made the trip on the way back from a visit to Turkey, where he met political leaders to discuss the threat from Islamic State militants.

Around one and a half million men, women and children were killed - 90 per cent of them Jewish - in Auschwitz when the area was occupied by the Nazis during the Second World War.

The site, which was liberated by the Red Army in 1945, is a network of concentration camps and extermination camps.

Prisoners were also used as slave labour, as cruelly depicted by the 'Arbeit Macht Frei' sign which Mr Cameron viewed at the main Auschwitz I site.

On a bitterly cold day, the Prime Minister visited the neighbouring Birkenau camp where he saw the train line on which Jewish prisoners arrived before being incarcerated.

And he paid his respects at a memorial to the victims - lighting a candle and pausing in silent reflection. 

Mick Davis, chairman of the Holocaust Commission, who accompanied Mr Cameron, said 'you only begin to understand the enormity of the Holocaust and the huge impact on humanity' by visiting the camp.

'I was just speaking to the Prime Minister just before he left for the airport, and he said to me that he's looked at all the films and read the books but you just can't understand the scale of what happened - the deprivation that took place, the collapse of humanity,' he said.

'Being here was important to the understanding of what took place.'

Mr Davis said he was worried that as survivors of the Holocaust passed away, 'society has a habit of consigning history to books and sterility'. 

Mr Cameron promised last year to visit Auschwitz during 2014. He said at the time of the pledge that more must be done to preserve the memory of the Holocaust at a time when 'anti-Semitism is returning to some parts of Europe'.

The Prime Minister announced an increase in government funding for the Holocaust Educational Trust, which takes children and teachers to visit Auschwitz-Birkenau.

Mr Cameron said it was important that 'we must never forget all those who were murdered here and at other camps and at other places'

He also launched a new national Holocaust commission, which will set up a permanent Holocaust memorial in Britain.

Mr Cameron told the Trust's appeal dinner: 'At a time when anti-Semitism is returning in some parts of mainland Europe, it is more important than ever that – as a whole country – we do everything possible to make sure that the memory of the Holocaust is preserved from generation to generation.

'The Holocaust Educational Trust are leading the way, and it is vital that they are supported.'

Last night Karen Pollock, the trust's chief executive, said: 'Today the Prime Minister visited the site of the most heinous crime in our shared history.

'He saw train tracks that brought Jews from across Europe in droves, the crude stables in which they were kept and the gas chambers in which they were ruthlessly murdered.'

She added: 'Over the last 15 years, with the support of Government funds, we have taken 25000 students and teachers to visit Auschwitz-Birkenau. They come back describing it as life changing.

'With the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz and the end of the Holocaust next year, this visit is fitting and timely.'
