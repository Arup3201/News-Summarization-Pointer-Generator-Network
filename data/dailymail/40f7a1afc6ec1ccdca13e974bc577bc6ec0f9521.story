A revealing new book will lift the lid on the secrets behind America’s most beloved comedy show –SNL- and the battles that raged between politicians over its most famous political satire sketches.

The book: 'Live from New York: An Uncensored History of Saturday Night Live by James Andrew Miller and Tom Shales will include 200 extra pages of material which did not appear in the original 2002 book.

According to excerpts from The Hollywood Reporter, Hillary Clinton's 'entitled attitude' could have indirectly helped then Senator Barack Obama to win the Democratic nomination to run in 2008.

Appearance: In 2007, then senator Barack Obama, right, appeared on SNL with Darrell Hammond, left, as Bill Clinton, Amy Poehler as Hillary Clinton during the 'Clinton Halloween Party' skit

SNL: Barack Obama stands in front of  Hillary Rodham Clinton who cancelled her appearance on SNL in 2007 which led to Obama appearing on it instead

According to the book, Clinton’s campaign lobbied for her to guest host SNL for the show’s season opener in 2007, when the former first lady was still favored to win the 2008 Democratic nomination.

But on the week of production, her campaign cancelled, leaving a spot open.

This, it’s
 thought, led a little known Senator called Barack Obama to take her 
place —possibly influencing the outcome of the 2008 presidential campaign.

Executive Producer Lorne Michaels recalls: ‘We put Obama on the date when Hillary was supposed to be on.’

‘The sense of entitlement which was following her everywhere at that point peaked for me at the bailing,’ he added.

Another excerpt reveals that Sarah Palin felt like she had been portrayed ‘as an idiot,’ by the gifted SNL comedian Tina Fey. This made her want to come on the show and change people's perception.

Palin said: ‘I know that they portrayed me as an idiot and I hated that and I wanted to come on the show and counter some of that.’

This, it appears was the incentive behind her awkward 2008 appearance alongside cast member Tina Fey.

Fey, captured national attention when she imitated Palin’s trademark beehive, red suit and distinctive accent and made the phrase: ‘I can see Russia from my house,’ world famous.

Before her appearance, family members had told Fey that she was the spitting image of the Vice Presidential nominee.

But she wasn’t convinced.

Lookalike: Before Tina Fey took on the role as Sarah Palin, her family said she looked similar to the Vice Presidential nominee Sarah Palin but she ignored them

She told them: ‘I don't think so. It's just brown hair and glasses. But some cousins and old classmates were all saying, ‘That lady looks like you.’'

‘I was sort of — arrogantly, in my own mind — resisting it, like, ‘I don't want to play that, and I don't know who's gonna write it, and what if I don't like what they wrote, people are going to think that I wrote it.’

But after she executed the character perfectly and Palin agreed to appear, Michaels said Fey was 'terrified of anything where they would be together looking like an endorsement.'

Michaels even called on celebrity friends to come and see the segment.

He said:' I called Alec [Baldwin] to come in for [Palin's appearance on Oct. 18, 2008], to be standing with me, because he was the most emblematic liberal at that point.

'He said he had to introduce a documentary at the Hamptons Film Festival on that Saturday, so he wouldn't be able to do it.

'So I said, 'Alec, your instincts are always great, but are you telling me you're not going to be here for this thing that the whole world is waiting to see?'

Yet, viewers tuned in in their droves to that particular segment which helped SNL draw its largest audience in 14 years with 14 million viewers.

Palin added: 'If I ran into Tina Fey again today, I would say: 'You need to at least pay for my kids' braces or something from all the money that you made off of pretending that you're me!

'My goodness, you capitalized on that! Can't you contribute a little bit? Jeez!'

In another
 excerpt, writer Michaels appealed to Obama to talk with NBC network 
chiefs who had expressed concern over a sketch which could be offensive to Arabs.

This was when Obama was doing a cameo on the show.

But he turned them down saying ‘It’s funny, but no, I don’t think so.'

However, Obama’s influence on the show was widespread.

James Downey, a writer-producer who retired in 2013 said: ‘The last couple seasons of the show were the only two in the show’s history where we were totally like every other comedy show: basically, an arm of the Hollywood Democratic establishment.

‘Jon Stewart was more nuanced. We just stopped doing anything which could even be misinterpreted as a criticism of Obama.’

Meanwhile, Jay Pharoah, castmember recalls how he did an event at Harvey Weinstein's house.

He said: ‘I was trying to take my makeup off because I was Obama at this event, and [Obama] stood right there watching me do it.

‘He was laughing; it was so petrifying. As long as there's no beef between me and the president, that's good. When that happens, you're Kanye West.’

In more 
sombre times, like right after 9/11, cast and crew recall how they were 
forced to give politics a rest because of the sensitivity surrounding 
events.

However, important political figures, presidential hopefuls and others have made it an important stop ever since President Ford’s first appearance in 1976.
