The email account that appears to belong to General David Petraeus' alleged mistress may have been broken into by hacking group Anonymous.

The email address that allegedly belongs to Paula Broadwell, the biographer who is at the center of the cheating scandal that forced the acclaimed former CIA director's resignation, is listed as one of the accounts that was broken into by the 'hacktivist' group.

Buzzfeed reports that the email is one of the ones that was obtained when the hackers targeted commercial intelligence company STRATFOR.

A Woman Scorned? It is being claimed that the affair between David Petraeus and Paula Broadwell emerged after she sent threatening emails to Ms Kelley

Not concerned about privacy: Broadwell tweeted her personal email account to her public page

Anonymous claimed responsibility for the December 24, 2011 hack and they used the email and credit card information that they obtained from the site to make more than $1million to a variety of charities.

Buzzfeed points out that it is unclear what information- if any- was stolen by the group.

Broadwell's email is a major point of contention in the ongoing federal investigation into Petraeus' extra marital affair that led to his resignation.

Her email that was hacked by the group was a derivation of her name, and it is not one that she has kept quiet since she posted the address on Twitter, inviting fans to email her for tickets to The Daily Show when she was doing a publicity visit to promote her Petraeus biography.

Broadwell is at the center of the storm surrounding Petraeus' downfall as she allegedly sent harassing emails to a woman that Petraeus worked with.

That woman, who has since been identified as Jill Kelley, contacted the FBI because she felt threatened and feared for her safety.

A government official told the New York Post that the emails contained such language as: 'I know what you did,' 'back off' and 'stay away from my guy.'

The official added: '[Broadwell] clearly thought something was going on' and thought she was in a 'lovers triangle.'

A person who knows both Mrs Kelley and Petraeus confirmed their friendship and said she saw him often.

All three of those involved- Kelley, Petraeus and Broadwell- were all married to other people and they all have multiple children.

Close: Broadwell first met Petraeus when he visited Harvard University, where she was a student

Petraeus quit his post as CIA director in disgrace on Friday while offering an apology over the affair, allegedly with his biographer, Paula Broadwell - who allegedly sent a threatening email to another woman whom she felt was getting to close to him.

His apology came as reports show that the affair blew up in Petraeus' face after Broadwell allegedly sent e-mails threatening another woman whom she accused of getting too close to him.

Petraeus told friends that he had begun the affair with Broadwell shortly after he had left the Army to begin his work with the CIA, according to ABC News.

Ed Williams, a neighbor who lives two houses down from the Broadwell family in Charlotte, North Carolina, neighborhood, told Reuters: 'Everyone is surprised and shocked.'

Earlier in the week, Williams, a retired editor, saw Broadwell with her two children when she was voting in last week's U.S. presidential election.

He said that Broadwell appeared chatty and cheerful. Neighbors were working on putting together a belated party to celebrate the release of her book.

'She gave no indication all this was going on,' Williams said.

Broadwell, who is married with two young sons, has not responded to multiple emails and phone messages.

She had planned to celebrate her 40th birthday in Washington this weekend, with many reporters invited. Her husband Scott emailed guests to cancel the party.
