As children, Rhys Enoch and his younger brother Ben would play golf and kid each other that a certain putt would be to win the Claret Jug.

When he crouches over a six-footer at Hoylake some time this week Rhys might think back to those days, in the achingly sad knowledge that his brother will not be here to see if he can hole it.

In May 2009 Ben was killed in a car crash while travelling up to the Lytham Trophy, one of the country’s top amateur events.

Outsider: Rhys Enoch made it to The Open after qualifying through a play-off

He was 19 and, like Rhys, a Welsh 
international reckoned to be an outstanding prospect. The memory of him 
will be all the more vivid tomorrow when Rhys tees up for his Open 
debut, having realised his dream of making the field through qualifying 
at Woburn earlier this month.

Of
 course, there will be butterflies, although these have a completely 
different meaning for the Truro-based Enoch family compared with other 
people.

‘My mum is quite a 
spiritual person and she relates the butterfly to Ben,’ said Rhys after 
completing a practice round at Royal Liverpool.

Going up: Enoch has rubbed shoulders with the likes of Jason Day this week, who was his practice partner

He
 took it as an omen when he saw one on the second hole of his second 
round at qualifying as he battled to get one of the precious spots for 
this week’s tournament.

‘This
 butterfly came to rest by the hole and it didn’t move,’ he said. 
‘Naturally, I thought of him then and I thought of him again when it 
came to the play-off hole later.’

With three players in the eliminator chasing one place at The Open, Rhys, 26, chipped in from 20 yards to win it.

‘Whether
 that had something to do with it I am not sure but I do feel that Ben 
is still there,’ he said. ‘There will be times I think of him this week 
because I’ve achieved the dream that we and so many other young golfers 
have.’

Tinged with sadness: Enoch's adventure will take place without his brother Ben who passed away in 2009

Rhys was on a golf 
scholarship at East Tennessee State University in the USA — and Ben had 
already secured a place to join him there — when the accident happened 
on an A road in Herefordshire.

‘I
 actually had a really good summer golf-wise after he died,’ said Rhys. 
‘The two things I thought would be difficult, playing golf and sleeping,
 were actually not difficult at all, perhaps because they were both a 
type of escape. Golf took my mind off everything.

‘Maybe
 it helped then and still does because if you miss a putt you realise 
there are much worse things in life that can happen.’

Struggle: Enoch, ranked 1,045 in the world, has also had to contend with the debilitating condition ME

Getting
 to this point has been all the more difficult because Rhys has also had
 to contend with the debilitating condition ME. It has contributed to 
him not yet earning his European Tour card and his current modest world 
ranking of 1,045.

‘I got 
glandular fever in the summer of 2012 and it seemed to stem from that,’ 
Rhys said. ‘There are times when all you want to do is sleep, it was 
really bad for three months but at least I got to watch a lot of the 
London Olympics. It has been a constant battle but the last six months 
have been much better.

‘There is not much you can do about it. I just try to eat well and boost my immune system as much as possible.’

Enoch,
 who is attached to Celtic Manor and now lives in Cardiff, had world No 6
 Jason Day among his practice partners yesterday.

He
 enthused about the ‘fantastic’ week he is having in a rare break from 
the obscurity of the Challenger Tour. His parents and grandmother will 
be there for what is sure to be a poignant few days.

Rhys
 cites his previous best career achievement as winning the East Regional
 championship on the competitive American college circuit four years 
ago, so it will be a completely new experience playing before Hoylake’s 
bulging galleries.

‘I’ve got
 to look on it as a big opportunity for trying to get my Tour card and 
try to treat it like any other event,’ he said. ‘Growing up, I have 
played a lot of links golf so the conditions are something I should be 
very comfortable with.’

100: It’s exactly 100 years since Harry Vardon (right) won his
sixth and final Open, a record.

£50: The prize money won by Vardon in 1914 — worth around
£5,000 today. That’s some way short of the £975,000 cheque the winner will
receive at Hoylake on Sunday.

£5,400,000: The
total prize purse  for the 2014 Open. A
century ago it was  just £135.

Zero: No player has ever won The Open twice at Hoylake, though
Tiger Woods could become the first this weekend.

One: Argentina’s Roberto De Vicenzo is the only South American to
have won The Open, and he did it at Hoylake in 1967.

1930: There is some hope for amateurs Ashley Chesters,
Bradley Neil, Cheng-tsung Pan and Paul Dunne this week. The last time an
amateur won The Open was at Royal Liverpool — Bobby Jones in 1930.

22: It’s been 22 years since an Englishman lifted the Claret Jug
— Nick Faldo triumphing at Muirfield in 1992. It’s an even longer wait for an
English champion at Hoylake — Alf Padgham in 1936.

Zero: Bad news for the likes of champion Phil Mickelson and
Bubba Watson — a  left-hander has never
won The Open at Royal Liverpool.
