Bosses at the Department for Work and Pensions were today left 'shaken and stirred' after pranksters posted a fake advert for a James Bond-esque 'Target Elimination Specialist' on their Jobcentre website.

The spoof recruitment ad appeared on the DirectGov site and stated that the successful applicant should be trained in using sniper rifles, be able to leave foreign countries by non-conventional means and assume new identities.

It added that candidates for the MI6 post should be willing to 'remove people' on behalf of the Government and would be equipped with special watches, jet packs and mini-submarines.

Spoof! The fake advert for an MI6 'Target Elimination Specialist' appeared on the DirectGov Jobs website on Friday afternoon

Hacked: The advert went on to state that successful candidates would be trained in the use of sniper rifles, mini-submarines and jet packs

The original: Daniel Craig as James Bond, an expert in all the dark arts mentioned in the spoof recruitment advert

It stated the salary was between 
£50,000 and £60,000 a year - barely enough to maintain a James 
Bond-style lifestyle of Martinis, women and sports cars - though there 
would be performance bonuses 'on completion of missions.'

A spokeswoman for the DWP confirmed 
that a professional killer was not being sought - even though MI6 have 
started advertising job vacancies in national magazines - and that the 
tongue-in-cheek ad had been removed.

The vacancy read: 'From time to time 
the UK Government has a need to remove people whose continued existence 
poses a risk to the effective conduct of public order.

'So we require particularly skilled 
professionals who are prepared to work on a non-attributable basis to 
deal with these problems.

'The role will involve international travel to a number of countries where individuals need to be removed.'

It continues: 'The ideal candidate 
will need to have no particular distinguishing features so as to blend 
in and be able to take on new identities as required.

Target Elimination: The Department of Work and Pensions confirmed the advert was the work of hackers and had now been taken offline

'They will need to be resourceful in 
finding ways to accomplish their missions and, in some cases, to leave 
foreign countries by non-conventional means.

'The role would suit candidates with prior military experience, particularly in the use of sniper rifles.'

It adds: 'The job holder will receive 
all necessary equipment, including passports, special watches, jet 
packs, mini-submarines and a Walther PPK.

'This role is particularly appropriate for those who like their martinis shaken and not stirred.

'To apply for this role, please 
express your interest somewhere in the vicinity of the large and rather 
fake-looking rock in Regent’s Park.'

It then provided a contact email address as mi6recruitment@hotmail.com.

New workplace: The 'Target Elimination Specialist' would presumably work out of here, the MI6 HQ near Vauxhall Bridge

The DWP confirmed that an assassin wasn't being sought and that the advert was quickly removed.

A spokeswoman said: 'It is disappointing that somebody would want to post a fake advert when people are looking for real jobs. It has now been removed.'

MI6 have started advertising for spies in recent weeks in a number of national newspapers and magazines.

Their advert states cryptically: 'If the qualities that make a good spy were obvious, they wouldn't make a very good spy.'
