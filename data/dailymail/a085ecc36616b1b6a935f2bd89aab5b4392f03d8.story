A mother questioned over the death of her six-month-old son was yesterday revealed to be an on-the-run Polish killer.

The 30-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was arrested after her son suffered fatal head injuries.

Social services from the same council that failed Baby P ruled he was not at risk, despite knowing about her criminal record.

Dark past: The mother, 30 (pictured with her son) was jailed for 12 years in her home country after a man was stabbed during a burglary gone wrong, but fled to the UK after being released on licence

Failings: Haringey child protection officers were told of the mother's past conviction, but decided not to put her son on the 'at risk' register before he died of head injuries

And the authorities face further questions over why she even remained in the UK more than four years after she absconded from her home country. 

The Daily Mail can reveal that the killer has attended 14 extradition hearings since her arrest in January last year but remained at large wearing an electronic tag.

The young boy, known only as Baby O, was rushed to hospital from his home in Haringey, north London, last month after his parents dialled 999.

He was treated at Great Ormond Street Hospital, where he died three days later. 

A post-mortem examination found he died from a head injury, raising fears that he may have been attacked.

His mother and her boyfriend, a 26-year-old unemployed Pole, were arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm.

It can be revealed that the woman was jailed for 12 years in her homeland in 2002 after a man was stabbed to death during a bungled burglary.

She was released on licence in March 2011 but fled the country, triggering a manhunt that led to her arrest 13 months ago.

Haringey Council faces serious questions over what its staff knew about the boy and whether they took all possible steps to ensure his safety.

Police and a hospital had already voiced their concerns to the local authority but social workers did not put Baby O on the ‘at risk’ register.

Tragic: Haringey social services were accused of failing Baby P - now known as Peter Connelly - after he died from more than 50 separate injuries in 2007

The council endured a storm of criticism after the death of 17-month-old Peter Connelly, known as Baby P, in August 2007. 

He suffered horrendous injuries at the hands of mother Tracey Connelly, her boyfriend Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen that went unchallenged.

Neighbours of the Polish couple claimed ambulances were repeatedly called to the property. 

One woman said: ‘In July, I heard a baby crying desperately from the house. An ambulance came around 15 times over the summer, always in the night. The paramedics would knock on my door and ask if I had called the ambulance and I said I hadn’t.

‘That’s why I thought the child was sick. I think the mother was calling the ambulance.’

The neighbour added that police conducted door-to-door inquiries after the baby was taken to hospital with fatal injuries.

Yesterday there were abandoned mattresses and overflowing bins outside the council house where Baby O was found.

Charity Kidscape said: ‘Despite repeated findings calling for urgent reforms we are again faced with the avoidable death of a baby known to those who should have protected him.’

A Haringey Council spokesman said: ‘The council is working with the police to understand the circumstances surrounding this tragic incident. 

'The independent Local Safeguarding Children Board will consider commissioning a review.’

A Met spokesman said the couple have been released on bail until later this month pending further inquiries.
