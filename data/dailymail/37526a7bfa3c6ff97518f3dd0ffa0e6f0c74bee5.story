An 18-year-old artist who died after he was Tased by police for spraying graffiti on an abandoned building has been laid to rest in an emotional ceremony in Miami.

Jacqueline Llach, the mother of Israel Hernandez-Llach, was seen clasping other family members as she sobbed and followed close behind his casket, which was buried at Vista Memorial Gardens in Miami Lakes on Wednesday.

The funeral home donated its services to the grieving family.

As around 100 relatives and friends gathered, Hernandez's sister Offir and mother poured sand over the casket as it was lowered to the ground, their faces awash with grief.

The cause of the teenager's death has not yet been released by the coroner's office, but at the funeral, the family claimed that the teenager was covered in bruises when he died.

This revelation could further fuel 
the outrage over how Miami Beach police officers handled Hernandez. 
Witnesses said that officers high-fived as the youngster lay dying after
he was Tased.

'There 
were bad bruises on the body that shows it was more than just a laser,' 
family spokesperson Fabio Andrade told NBC Miami.

Neira Sheffer, a family friend who is a lawyer, added: 'The way the police executed things was not the most appropriate.'

Hernandez's
distraught father called for an investigation into what he called an 
'act of barbarism and assassination' as Officer Jorge Mercado, a 13-year
veteran of the force, was placed on paid administrative leave - pending
an investigation - for his involvement.

The teenager, an award-winning 
artist, was stunned in the chest after officers reportedly caught him 
spray-painting the front of a closed McDonald's and gave chase for ten 
minutes before catching him.

Thiago
Souza, who was with Hernandez-Llach and acting as his lookout, said the
chase began as soon as the officers approached them and told them to 
stop.

Losing sight of his friend during the chase, Souza caught up to him to find Hernandez-Llach face-down on the sidewalk.

'I
didn’t even know they fired a Taser. I thought they just had him down 
and he was arrested and was just tired,’ Souza said to the Miami Herald.

'I couldn’t believe what I was seeing,’ said Souza, 19. 'I asked the cops ‘what happened to my friend?’

Souza then alleges that the police began to make fun of how they caught the teenage artist.

'He said, "You should have seen how 
funny it was when his butt clenched when he got Tased" he said, and they
were all clapping and doing high-fives all over his body. It was almost
like they were proud of what they did.'

It was then that they all noticed medics working furiously to revive Hernandez, after he lost consciousness.

'The cop told me he was dead. It was just a powerful image seeing my friend there, with the medics pumping him.’

Miami
Beach Police Chief Raymond Martinez said his department was 
investigating the incident and expressed his condolences to the family 
of Hernandez, a Colombian immigrant who graduated from high school this 
summer.

According to the police report, Hernandez fled after he was confronted by police about 5 a.m.

The pursuit ended with Hernandez cornered and, with nowhere to go, he began running toward the officers, Martinez said Wednesday.

To avoid physically restraining Hernandez, Officer Jorge Mercado used his Taser.

Martinez said after being 
stunned, the teenager began showing signs of distress and 
paramedics were called

He was transported to Mount Sinai Hospital, 
where he was pronounced dead about 6:15 a.m.

The boy's family held a press conference with lawyers 
at their Miami Beach apartment last week to say they planned to file a
complaint with the FBI or the Florida Department of Law Enforcement 
over what they described as excessive use of force by the officers 
involved.

'We do not want Miami Beach police 
investigating the Miami Beach Police Department. We're calling for an 
independent investigation by an outside agency,' said Jose Javier 
Rodriguez, an attorney for the family and a Florida state legislator.

'There
is no justification of this kind of action for a second-degree 
misdemeanor,' said Jason W. Kreiss, another lawyer representing the 
family.

Hernandez would likely not have been prosecuted over the spray-painting and would have faced a punishment of community service, he added.

Police
in Miami have not made any of the reports of the incident public, but 
Officer Thomas Lincoln, who wrote the official incident report said that
he did not see Hernandez shot by the Taser.

He said that when he arrived on the scene the teen was 'sitting on the ground and against a wall.'.

Martinez said Hernandez-Llach fled after being seen 'vandalizing private property' shortly before dawn on Tuesday.

Hernandez, who identified himself by the so-called tag name 'Reefa', was known for his graffiti work as well as for his sculptures and paintings.

'He
did it a lot,' said Hernandez's friend, Rafael Lynch, referring to his 
graffiti. 'He wasn't a bad person at all. The cops didn't like him or 
what he looked like.'

'In my 20 years as an art teacher, 
Israel was one of the most unique and talented students I have ever 
encountered,’ added Frank O'Hare, his art teacher at Miami Beach High.

Officer Jorge Mercado has a checkered history with the Miami Beach police.

According to his internal affairs record, Mercado has had six complaints filed against him ranging from battery to violating the department's code of respect.

However, all the complaints were dismissed bar one - a violation of drug testing procedures in January 2011 for which he was suspended for 160 hours.
