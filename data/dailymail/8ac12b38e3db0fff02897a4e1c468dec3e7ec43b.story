Last year, a mother in Utah also gave birth to a 14lb baby boy, who was dubbed America's biggest baby of 2013.

Joel Brandon Jr., nicknamed J.J., was born by caesarean section at Timpanogos Regional Hospital in Orem, weighing in at 14 pounds and measuring 22 inches long. 

His mother, Sara Brandon, said she was stunned by how big J.J. was when she delivered him at 38-and-a-half weeks, as a previous ultrasound predicted he was going to be 11 pounds.

The largest baby ever recorded was born in Canada to mother Anna Bates in 1879, a boy weighing 23lb 12oz, who died 11 hours later.

In 2005 a Brazilian woman gave birth to a 17lb baby boy named Admilton dos Santos.

He was mother Francisca’s fifth child and it is thought that his size was caused by gestational diabetes.
