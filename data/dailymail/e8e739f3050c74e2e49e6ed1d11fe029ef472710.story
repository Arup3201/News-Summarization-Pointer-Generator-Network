Paedophile: Loren Morris, 21, was sentenced to prison after a court found that she had slept with a child 50 times

A female paedophile has been jailed for having sex with an eight-year-old boy more than fifty times.

Loren Morris, 21, was 16 when she first slept with the schoolboy, who cannot be identified, and continued until he was ten years old.

Morris, who has a child of her own, would have regular intercourse with the boy, now 14, and was only found out after he was overheard bragging about it at school.

A judge today gave Morris a two-year prison sentence at Worcester Crown Court, following a trial last month where she was convicted of three counts of sexual intercourse with a child under 16.

She could be seen smiling and smoking outside the court today as she awaited her sentence.

The judge in the case told Morris that he would be lenient with the sentence - which will see her released from jail after one year - because she 'realised it was wrong' and stopped having sex with the boy.

West Mercia police said they started investigating Morris in March last year after the 
boy's school told them that he had been heard bragging about having sex with her.

Judge Robert Juckes QC said: 'I make no secret of the fact your case has given me cause for much consideration.

'I have come to the conclusion that due to the concern and embarrassment caused to both you and your family that you will not be offending again, let alone committing sexual offences.

'I am also aware of the effect this will have on your baby. I am pleased to hear your parents have started to build bridges with you.

'That does not stop the fact though that you had full sexual intercourse with a child when he was eight to 10 years old - by his evidence it was upwards of fifty times.

'It seems to me that I am bound to pass an immediate custodial sentence. I take into account what has been said to me and the fact that you stopped the activity yourself.

'You realised it was wrong rather than being caught and forced to stop. Therefore my sentence is one of two years. You will serve 12 months in prison before being released on licence.'

Repeated: The court heard that Morris slept with the boy, who cannot be named, more than 50 times

Defence lawyer Antonie Mullers had told the court Morris was struggling to accept the facts of the case, and asked Judge Juckes to spare her a prison sentence altogether.

He said: 'Her immaturity at 21 means she cannot accept the facts yet. She accepts her conviction but with time will accept more.

'Her parents have stepped in and are building bridges, I understand she has met with some of her family.

'This could be stifled by a custodial sentence so I urge your honour or try and suspend it if possible.'

Morris, from Hereford, will serve two years each for the three counts to be served concurrently.

Her sentence included a Sexual Offences Prevention Order, banning her from contact with a child under 16 without permission of a parent. She was also ordered to sign the Sexual Offenders Register, where her details will remain for ten years.
