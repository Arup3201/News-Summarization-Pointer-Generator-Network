Ministers last night unveiled a clampdown on the blanket use of surveillance cameras in pubs.

They took action after concerns that a rising number of councils have been making the installation of CCTV a legal condition of granting licences to pubs.

Under the new regime, local authorities will be subject to a stricter code of practice designed to strike a better balance between privacy and security.

The change comes after the Information Commissioner’s Office, the UK’s privacy watchdog, said that it was becoming seriously concerned by the profusion of CCTV even in trouble-free pubs.

Surveillance camera systems are widely used in England and Wales, but community pubs minister Brandon Lewis said things had gone too far.

He said the principle of surveillance by consent is at the heart of the new legislation, so the public can be confident that cameras are not there to spy on them but to protect them.

He has laid a new code of practice before Parliament for approval, as part of the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012.

Mr Lewis said: ‘CCTV has a role to play in stopping and deterring crime in anti-social behaviour hotspots.

Under the new regime, local authorities will be subject to a stricter code of practice designed to strike a better balance between privacy and security for drinkers

'But well-run pubs that don’t have a public order problem shouldn’t be tarred with the same brush.

‘The public deserves to have a pint in peace without being snooped on.

This government has called time on big brother’s secret, intrusive and costly rules that have forced pub landlords to pay to install CCTV where it was not needed.

‘The use of surveillance cameras should be used only if it is necessary and where it has public support.’

Last night Nick Pickles, director of privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘People should be able to enjoy a quiet pint without being constantly recorded on camera.

‘This announcement brings some long overdue common sense to a situation where councils were driving up the cost of a pint by demanding pubs spend thousands of pounds on CCTV where there are no problems to deal with.

‘Our privacy is too important to be undermined by a tick-box on a licensing form.

‘I’m sure landlords across the  country will join me in raising a  glass to Brandon Lewis for defending people’s local pubs from needless surveillance cameras.’
