A  mechanic carrying out a standard MOT test on a Mercedes smashed it through a garage wall after accidentally stepping on the accelerator.

The silver E-Class car had been in the garage for its annual test at Cherry's MOT Centre in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, when the incident happened.

The unnamed owner was sitting in the waiting area when he heard an 'almighty bang' and ran out to see his pride and joy lodged in the wall.

The car was halfway through the wall surrounded by bricks and debris from the smash.

The MOT tester is thought to have pressed the accelerator not realising the automatic car had been left in drive.

The Mercedes now needs a new front end - and the garage was left in need of a bricklayer.

Garage owner Alan Cherry said the incident 'was an accident and no one was to blame'.

A new E-Class Mercedes costs around £30,000.
