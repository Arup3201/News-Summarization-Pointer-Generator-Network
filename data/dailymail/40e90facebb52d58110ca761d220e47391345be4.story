It seems that Suge Knight and Katt Williams feel like they were put in jail for no good reason following an incident with a female photographer that happened on September 5 in Los Angeles.

Knight and Williams were both arrested Wednesday and charged with felony robbery after a photographer claims the men stole her camera while she was snapping photos of them last month. 

Now, sources close to Knight are saying the rap mogul was just trying to protect his young son - and that no one ever took the photographer's camera.

According to TMZ, Williams' friend confronted the woman when she refused to stop snapping pics of Knight, who is still recovering for injuries sustained when he was shot just two months ago, and his 4-year-old son. 

She asked the woman to delete the photos on her camera, but she refused. 

This, however, is where the stories become wildly different. 

Members of Knight's camp claim, 'the photog is a liar and her camera was NEVER stolen, she had it in her possession when cops came.'

Law enforcement sources are saying however, 'Suge orchestrated the entire thing and that Katt was just following his orders.' 

Though Williams is the one who is actually said to have taken the camera, both are being charged.

If found guilty, Suge faces significantly more time than Katt due to a previous assault with a deadly weapon conviction accoriding to the D.A.

'If convicted, Knight, who has a prior conviction for assault with a deadly weapon, faces up to 30 years to life in state prison,' they said. 

'Williams faces up to seven years in custody.'

Investigations continue: Beverly Hills police are continuing to look into the alleged incident, which reportedly left the woman with 'minor injuries' 

Both men made bail, with prosecutors asking it to be set at $1 million for the record label founder and $75,000 for the comedian.

Photos of the alleged incident show a woman nursing an injured finger, however, neither Katt nor Suge were pictured at the scene.

Beverly Hills police Sgt. Max Subin told the LA Times that after coming out of the studio the comedian and hip hop mogul came across the photographer and allegedly chased the woman down an alley.

The officer said Kat then grabbed the woman's camera 'forcibly' and she 'sustained minor injuries'.

When police arrived on the scene, both of the stars had left, he said. Neither man has been charged with assault. 

Both Suge - whose real name is Marion - and Katt - real name Micah - have had their fair share of run-ins with police.

When he was arrested on Wednesday, Katt was to face court over a July 15 incident in Inglewood when he allegedly pepper-sprayed a man and tried to hit him with his car.

The comedian was charged with two counts of felony assault in addition to the use of tear gas.

That same month, Los Angeles County sheriffs were called to the Comedy Store in West Hollywood after reports he pulled out a gun and smashed a car window. No charges were laid over that incident.

Suge's rap sheet is a little longer, with the 49-year-old first arrested in 1992 on assault and weapons charges for which he received probation.

However in 1996, he was arrested after security cameras at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas caught him and a group of other men beating a gang member. He was sentenced to nine years in prison for parole violation. 

He was imprisoned twice more for violating his parole after being caught consorting with gang members and then assaulting a valet in 2003.

Suge has also been the victim of a number of serious crimes - and has been shot three times.

Besides getting shot in August, Suge was also injured in 2005, when he was shot in Miami during another pre-awards party.

Most famously he was hit by bullet fragments in 1996 in Las Vegas when he was sitting next to rapper Tupac Shakur during a drive-by hit on their car. Tupac did not survive.

Tough year: On August 24, the rap mogul was shot six times inside Chris Brown's pre-VMA party at a Hollywood nightclub. It was the third time he had been injured in a shooting
