The owner of a ladies' clothes shop called Isis has become the victim of a hate campaign after people mistakenly linked it to the jihadist network terrorising the Middle East.

Jill Campbell has run the IsisBoutique in Malvern, Worcestershire for seven years but has been forced to issue a statement saying she has no connection to the extremist group.

The 54-year-old revealed today that pedestrians walking past her shop and people on social media have subjected her and her staff to abuse due to her shop sharing a name with the terrorist organisation.

She revealed that one internet troll even threatened to letter bomb her shop unless she changes the name.

Mother-of-two Ms Campbell said: 'This terrorism is happening thousands of miles away, and yet my business in Malvern is being targeted, it's bizarre.

'There was a particularly nasty comment on our Facebook page from someone who said we would get a letter bomb in the shop if we didn't change our name.

'Another person posted "Terrorism comes to Malvern" alongside a picture of the front of our shop.

'I overheard another couple talking about the name last weekend when the woman said to her partner "look that shop's called ISIS" and he said "they're the ones who have been beheading everybody".

'I can't believe I have to do this, but I want to make it clear I do not in any way, nor does this business, have any affiliation with, or support for, this vile terrorist group in the Middle East.

The shop has been called Isis for seven years but the name only started causing trouble this year

Passers-by are becoming angry because the shop shares a name with the terror group in Syria and Iraq

She added: 'It's been going on for the last couple of months now. Two or three times a week passers-by will make ridiculous and ill-advised comments to us in the shop about being involved in terrorism.'

'It has also filtered onto social media, and we are having to monitor our Twitter account and ask to have tweets removed that are suggesting we are linked to terrorism.

'To see a tiny little business, in a tiny little town in a tiny part of the world become connected with, in some peoples' eyes, international terrorism is madness.

'I'm sure most people in the town know the truth, it's just a few making idiotic comments.'

Ms Campbell is also considering putting her plans to open a new shop in the Cotswolds on hold.

She added: 'Even though it's absurd, I do unfortunately feel I have to protect my business.

'It's getting out of hand, and I just want it to blow over. Luckily my staff are fine with it, as are existing customers as we are established here.'

She has refused to change the name, which comes from the Egyptian goddess of beauty and femininity

She added: 'I was thinking of opening a second shop in the Cotswolds, but with this going on, I'm considering whether to put it on hold now, which is a real shame.

'We had looked at a shop in Stow-on-the-Wold which is 12 miles from the home of David Cameron in Dean so you can imagine the bad publicity if people say ISIS has moved onto the Prime Minister's doorstep.

'People are telling me I should change the name of the business, but why should I? We've been here for seven years, we were called ISIS before all of this, and the name represents our business.'

Ms Campbell says she came up with the name ISIS after leaving Oxford in 2007.

She added: 'I came up with the name because the river in Oxford is named locally as ISIS and it is also the Egyptian goddess of magic, mystique, beauty and femininity which is everything the shop is all about.'

The goddess Isis was first worshipped in Ancient Egypt as the ideal mother and wife as well as the patroness of nature and magic.

She is often depicted as the mother of Horus, the falcon-headed god featured throughout Egyptian theology.

Her image as a model of womanhood made her popular both with the slaves, who saw her as a mother-figure, and the wealthy, who saw her as a example to wives.

It was believed that the annual flooding of the River Nile came from the tears of Isis as she wept over the death of her brother Osiris. 

The figure of Isis passed into Roman and Greek mythology and she is still worshipped by some pagans today. 

Some scholars have suggested images of Isis holding her son influenced images of Mary and Jesus in Christian religion.

She was also incorporated into the symbolism of Freemasonry and is referred to in Mozart's opera, the Magic Flute.

The goddess also gives her name to the section of the River Thames from its source until it reaches Dorchester-on-Thames.
