Former rugby player Ben Cohen and his wife Abby have separated after 11 years of marriage.

The athlete and activist, who was part of England's 2003 World Cup winning squad, announced on Wednesday the couple were taking time time apart.

In a joint statement, their representative said: 'Ben and Abby Cohen have agreed to take time apart to deal with some marital issues but remain fully committed to the welfare of their children.

'There is no third party involved, and Ben and Abby now ask that their privacy and that of their family be respected at this difficult time.'

The couple, who wed in 2003 after eight years together, have two daughters together.

While it isn't clear how long ago they parted ways, Ben has been spotted at several events in London over the past week, including the Julien Macdonald London Fashion Week show last Friday and the Dot Com Children's Fund Charity Gala on Tuesday.

The retired rugby player, 36, was still wearing his wedding ring as he left the gala at Mansion House in the City of London on Tuesday night.

The gala was an opportunity for him to catch up with a host of his former Strictly Come Dancing friends.

Also in attendance was his former professional partner Kristina Rihanoff, who he ended up in eighth place on last year's series.

News of Ben's split will no doubt fuel what some have dubbed 'the curse of Strictly' after many celebrity contestants' marriages and relationships have broken down following the show.

Ben's fellow 2013 contestant Susanna Reid's long-term relationship with the father of her children ended following her appearance on Strictly.

In November last year, Countdown presenter Rachel Riley revealed her marriage had ended and earlier this month went public with her Strictly professional partner Pasha Kovalev as a couple.

The new series of Strictly hasn't even begun and two celebrity contestants Simon Webbe and Sunetra Sarker have also announced their love splits.
