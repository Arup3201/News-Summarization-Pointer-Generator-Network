The six Spitfires, two Hurricanes, a Lancaster, a Dakota and two Chipmunks delight thousands of spectators each year at flying displays across Britain.

And now a glorious set of previously-unseen photographs documenting the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight over the years has been released.

The first memorial flight was flown in September 1945 over The Mall in central London, and the event soon became an annual commemoration.

Team effort: A Lancaster, Spitfire and Hurricane perform in a Battle of Britain Memorial Flight over Kent in August 2012. This image is taken from a book by Keith Wilson

Classic plane: The flight operates six Spitfires (one pictured over Coningsby in October 2012), two Hurricanes, a Lancaster, a Dakota and two Chipmunks

Up in the air: Chipmunk trainers in the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight, which performs at flying displays across Britain every summer

Inside view: The RAF's Battle Of Britain Memorial Flight team take flight in their Dakota aircraft, to perform a flypast over the RAF Museum in Hendon, north-west London

Saluting history: A Lancaster in the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight is pictured. The plane played a vital role in defeating the Nazis during the Second World War

Old and new: A special formation to mark the 50th Anniversary of the Battle of Britain was flown along the south coast in June 1990 with a Concorde and a Spitfire

Magnificent men: A Spifire in the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight is pictured. Photographer Keith Wilson was given full official access to the Flight to give a pictorial insight

The RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight team was formed just over a decade later in 1957 by Wing Commander Peter Thompson.

It serves as a permanent reminder of 
the 544 RAF aircrew killed during the Battle of Britain of the Second 
World War in the summer and autumn of 1940.

Photographer Keith Wilson has been 
granted official access to the flight for a new Haynes Publishing book to give a pictorial insight into all its activities.

The pictures include those from the 
aircraft and their crews to ground crews and support staff, and from 
display planning to major winter overhauls.

Nearly 3,000 RAF pilots, including 
hero Douglas Bader who lost both legs but carried on flying, were 
involved in the Battle more than 70 years ago.

Aerial view: The Phantom of the Ruhr in flight along the south coast near Dover in August 2012. The aircraft is painted to represent Lancaster III, EE139

Upside down: PS915 was repainted in 2004 to replicate PS888, which carried out the last operational sortie flown by an RAF Spitfire in 1954, hence 'The Last' wording

Soaring above: The LF363 Hurricane was photographed here during a special air-to-air photoshoot close to the south-east coast of England in August 2012

Flying close: A Hurricane and Spitfire take part in a Battle of Britain Memorial Flight. The photos are taken from a book by Keith Wilson, and Haynes Publishing

Close call: When the Synchro routine is displayed, both of these aircraft fly a series of opposition manoeuvres, much like the Red Arrows display team

Getting ready: Technicians from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight load poppies onto the Lancaster in preparation for a drop over central London in June 2012

Days gone by: Nearly 3,000 RAF pilots, including hero Douglas Bader who lost both legs but carried on flying, were involved in the Battle more than 70 years ago

They fought the most important battle this country ever faced and their victory saved Britain from the tyranny of Nazi Germany.

The battle was the only one ever 
fought entirely in the air. It was a pivotal turning point of the war, 
persuading Hitler to scrap a planned UK invasion.

At the time many airmen were in their
late teens or early 20s when they took to the skies in Spitfires and 
Hurricanes from July to October 1940.

Others flew in Blenheims, Beaufighters and Defiants, becoming the ‘aces’ of the Battle, shooting down plane after plane.
