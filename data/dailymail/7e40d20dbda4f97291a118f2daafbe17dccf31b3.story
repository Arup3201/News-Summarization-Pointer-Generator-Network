Chelsea forward Didier Drogba and Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi have been opponents many times over the year - with the Argentine often coming out on top.

And so it has proved again off the pitch as the duo star in a Turkish Airlines advert, flying around the world trying new 'epic food'.

Drogba flies to destinations such as Nepal, Japan and Siberia in a bid to outdo Messi but finds a signed picture of his rival hanging up at all the locations, suggesting the Argentine had already been to the food venue.

Drogba was surprised to see an image of Barcelona superstar Messi hanging up on the wall 

The Ivory Coast legend pretends to look disheartened until he gets on to the plane.

However he does not know he has in fact been overshadowed by Messi once again as the La Liga star's face is printed on to the side of the plane.

Messi has the opportunity of trying some good old English cuisine this week as he has been in London and Manchester during the last couple of days.

The Barcelona man scored Argentina's winner against Croatia at Upton Park on Wednesday and is expected to face Cristiano Ronaldo's Portugal at Old Trafford on Tuesday.
