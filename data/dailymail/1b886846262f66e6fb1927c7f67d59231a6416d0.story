Fearne Cotton yesterday hit back at the ‘huge bullies’ who have criticised her lacklustre presenting of the BBC’s Diamond Jubilee coverage.

In an emotional series of Twitter messages, the 30-year-old also revealed she had suffered bullying at school – and would not accept it again.

The Radio One host tweeted: ‘I was bullied at school so there’s no way I’m having it as a grown woman.

‘Grown men who slag me off in articles or online are huge bullies.

‘I’m from a working-class family and have worked hard to get to where I am today. Others will just sit and do nothing but judge.

‘People who sit lazily and judge others will never grow. They’ll never take a look at themselves or feel content. Shame so many do.

‘I love my job and wouldn’t be doing it if I wasn’t any good at it. I have been working non-stop for 15 years, thank you.’

She also hit back directly at one Twitter user, who wrote: ‘You were pretty rubbish on the Pageant day, love. And if you can’t see why, then maybe you should find a new career.’

She responded: ‘This is what I’m talking about. YOU=bully. Take a look at yourself.’

And in response to those claiming they had the right to an opinion about her presenting, Miss Cotton added: ‘Opinions are one thing, outright bullying is another. VERY different.’

By yesterday afternoon the BBC had received 4,487 complaints about its Jubilee coverage, with Miss Cotton’s item on Tuesday about a sick bag adorned with the Queen’s face proving the most controversial. Two thousand complaints focused on the quality of the coverage of Sunday's pageant.

Miss Cotton was also heavily criticised for addressing a war veteran called John as Jim during an interview on board HMS Belfast on Sunday.

Although the presenter later congratulated herself and her colleagues on ‘seven hours of spotless TV’, the viewers were less impressed, saying she was ‘out of her depth’, ‘irritating’ and ‘sycophantic’.

Her impassioned defence of her performance came after another one of the Corporation's main presenters admitted its Diamond Jubilee coverage misfired.

Blustery: Claire Balding reports from a boat on the Thames on Sunday - she was one of the few presenters praised for her on screen efforts

Clare Balding confessed she believed the corporation’s coverage of the river pageant fell short.

And
in an acknowledgement of the audience’s frustration at the ‘inane’ 
commentary, she said: ‘If you ever hear me say the atmosphere is 
wonderful, shoot me.’

Miss Balding was the first presenter to speak out about the coverage, which brought more than 3,600 complaints.

She said at the Hay Festival: ‘I think (the BBC’s) aim with the pageant was to give a festival atmosphere.

The right tone: Huw Edwards presented sombre and serious coverage of the Thanksgiving service for the Queen at St Paul's

‘They
were worried that a camera just looking at a boat might be a bit dull. 
It was done with the best of intentions. There was a lot going on that 
was difficult to deal with.’

Miss Balding reported from  the 
£1million rowing boat Gloriana and said that six out of the nine cameras
on the vessels were not working and bad weather caused communications 
problems between producers and presenters.

She
suggested better preparation would have helped, adding: ‘It is 
difficult to cover a big event. You have a minute to make an impact.

'Because of my sports background I believe facts are my friend.

'If you ever hear me say the atmosphere is wonderful, shoot me.’

The BBC's creative director, Alan Yentob, acknowledged it had misjudged certain aspects of the coverage. He said: 'Nothing gets a universal three cheers.' But he added: 'I can honestly say the BBC has never had a challenge as staggeringly big as this.'
