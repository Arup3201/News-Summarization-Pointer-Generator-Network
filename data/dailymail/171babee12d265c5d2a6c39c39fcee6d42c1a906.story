Billionaire investor Warren Buffett is dipping into the ketchup business as part of $23.3 billion deal to buy the Heinz ketchup company.

Shares in H.J. Heinz Co. bounced 20 per cent to $72.45 after the deal, which is the largest ever in the food industry. Heinz, based in Pittsburgh, also makes Classico spaghetti sauces, Ore-Ida potatoes and Smart Ones frozen meals.

'It's our kind of company,' Buffett said in an interview on CNBC, noting its signature ketchup has been around for more than a century. 'I've sampled it many times.'

Secretary of State John Kerry and his Heinz heiress wife Teresa are licking their lips after the multi-billion dollar ketchup deal, which reportedly made them more than $670,000 today. The total value of their Heinz shares now stands at an estimated $4,029,123.

The company was founded by Henry John Heinz and his neighbor L. Clarence Noble in 1869. The pair's first product was grated 
horseradish, bottled in a clear glass to showcase its purity.

The first 
ketchup was introduced in 1876; the company says it was the country's 
first commercial grade ketchup.

Last year, Heinz says it had sales of $11.6 billion, with ketchup and sauces accounting for just under half of that. Given the saturated North American market, the company has increasingly looked overseas for growth. In 2013, emerging markets are expected to account for a quarter of the company's sales.

Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital, 
the investment firm which bought Burger King in 2010, say Heinz will 
remain headquartered in Pittsburgh. Heinz CEO William Johnson said in a 
statement that the company 'will have an opportunity to drive further 
growth' as a private enterprise.

Representatives for Heinz and the 
investment group weren't able to immediately provide any further details
on the deal, including whether there would be any management changes or
layoffs.

Buffett did not 
immediately respond to a message from The Associated Press on Thursday. 
But he has recently said that he's been hunting for elephant-sized deals
and at the end of September he had $47.8 billion cash on hand to 
finance any investments.

Generally, Buffett prefers to buy 
entire companies for his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate and then allow 
the businesses to continue operating much the way they were before.

Berkshire has also helped finance 
deals before – most recently during the financial crisis of 2008, when 
he made lucrative deals for Berkshire when few other companies had cash. Berkshire's biggest acquisition ever was its $26.3 billion purchase of BNSF railroad in 2010. Before that, it was the $16 billion stock purchase of reinsurance giant General Re in 1998.

Heinz shareholders will receive $72.50 in cash for each share of common stock they own.

The transaction value includes the assumption of Heinz's debt. Based on Heinz's number of shares outstanding, the deal is worth $23.3 billion excluding debt. The per-share price for the deal represents a 20 percent premium to Heinz's closing price of $60.48 on Wednesday.

Heinz said the deal was unanimously approved by its board. Buffett said on CNBC that Berkshire is putting $12 billion to $13 billion into the deal. But he noted that Berkshire will still have room to make more acquisitions because its businesses continually replenish its cash supply.

'Anytime we see a deal is attractive and it's our kind of business and we've got the money, I'm ready to go,' Buffett said. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter.

The Heinz heiress and her secretary of state husband are said to have made around $670,000 on today's deal after shares bounced 20 per cent to $72.45 each.

According to website Open Secrets, last year then-Senator Kerry disclosed slightly over $3 million worth of HJ Heinz Co. shares. 

Business Insider calculated that Kerry's stake in the company would have increased to about $3,357,603 at yesterday's close, after shares rose 11.92 per cent from December 30, 2011 through February 13, 2013.

Add the 20 per cent jump on the back of news Buffett, who is renowned for his business savvy, is dipping in, and that's an additional increase of $671,520.

The rise puts the couple's asset valuation of Heinz at $4,029,123, assuming they haven't sold any shares since Kerry's 2011 disclosure.
