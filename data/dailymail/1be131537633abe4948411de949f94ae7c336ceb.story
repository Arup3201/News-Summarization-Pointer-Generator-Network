Most people bite their nails when they're nervous or get cravings for chocolate or crisps.

But two sisters from Bradford have taken it to a whole new level - regularly munching on candles and second-hand books.

Twins Adele and Anita, both 50, suffer from Pica - an eating disorder characterised by the desire to eat items with little or no nutritional value, such as stones, sand, paint and dirt.

Twins Adele and Anita, both 50, suffer from Pica - an eating disorder characterised by the desire to eat items with little or no nutritional value, such as stones, sand paint and dirt

Adele eats her way through around two inches of wax every day to 'relieve anxiety'. She estimates she has eaten 300 candles in her lifetime

For Adele, the problem began when she was a child. She now eats around two inches of wax every day, much like many people tuck into a chocolate bar.

'When I was eight or nine I started sniffing fire lighters,' she told ITV's This Morning. 'I then started nibbling on candles and have done ever since.'

She says candles are an emotional 
crutch - and the 300 she has eaten in her lifetime have apparently never caused her any health problems.

'Carrying a candle with me calms my nerves. A whole candle will last me two weeks - I only take a little 
bit [about at an inch or two] out at a time so people don't see it.'

Her sister Anita is obsessed with the smell of old books - and regularly eats them. 'The older the book, the better it tastes,' she said. She shreds books before eating them (pictured)

Anita now scours charity shops looking for ripe old tomes - and is unbothered by the germs and dust they may be harbouring

For her sister Anita, Pica struck later in life - when she was pregnant 24 years ago.

'I began having cravings for things that smelled like old bus tickets,' she told presenters Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes.

'When I found the smell again, it was in an old book - and I haven't been able to stop since.

'The older the book, the better it tastes. I just love really old books. It's like eating a chocolate bar.'

Pica is an eating disorder that is characterised by the desire to eat items with little or no nutritional value.

These can include stones, sand, paint and dirt.

It is most common in people with learning disabilities and during pregnancy.

It can cause a range of serious complications if the patient is eating something that is poisonous or indigestible.

She now scours charity shops looking for ripe old tomes - and is unbothered by the germs and dust they may be harbouring.

Once procured, the book is shredded to a tagliatelle-sized strand before being consumed.

Asked by an astounded Eamonn Holmes why she couldn't just sniff the books, she replied: 'No, I have to taste them!

'Sniffing them works up an aroma - and I'm happy with what I do.'

Commenting on the twins' eating condition, eating disorders psychologist Marcia Karp, told the programme: 'There are many reasons why people take non-food stuffs into their body.

'Pregnant women often have bizarre cravings and Pica can be sometimes be due to a mineral deficit.'

She added: 'I have a friend who eats clay. She says: "It calms me, it soothes me - it's almost like mother's milk".'

In June, MailOnline reported the story of Patrice Benjamin-Ramgoolam, who eats a tablespoon of brick each morning, scaped from her bedroom wall.

Appearing on This Morning, she said: It's almost like someone who has a drug addiction – it’s like a fix. 'My body [calls] for it - my mouth will literally be dribbling.'

The sisters insist they are happy with their habits - and have experienced no health problems as a result of their bizarre cravings
