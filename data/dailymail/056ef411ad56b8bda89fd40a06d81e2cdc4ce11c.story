A South Texas mother stabbed her toddler son to death whilst a terrified woman and child barricaded themselves in the next room.

Police have described 26-year-old Tashawna Caldwell as being 'hysterical' when they arrived at the scene on Sunday night.

Caldwell has now been charged in the death of Caiden Parker who was about to turn two on Wednesday.

She is now in jail on a charge of capital murder of a child with her bond set at $1 million.

The second woman was unhurt but the child had 'minor scratches' on his body after being injured in the attack.

In jail: Tashawna M Caldwell, a woman who has been charged with capital murder in the stabbing death of her 2-year-old son. She's in custody in the Atascoca County Jail in Jourdanton

Confession: On Sunday, Tashawna Caldwell allegedly admitted to killing her boy, who would have celebrated his second birthday on Wednesday

Investigators are trying to determine what prompted the attack early Sunday at a home near Poteet which is 25 miles south of San Antonio.

Deputies responded to a disturbance call. Sheriff  David Soward says the boy, Caiden Parker, was dead at the scene.

A second woman with an older child was found in another room of the residence where the pair took cover for protection, Sheriff David Soward said.

Untimely death: When police found Caldwell she was hysterical. Her son, Calden Parker, was discovered with multiple stab wounds. He died at the scene

Before his time: Little Calden Parker, 1, was to celebrate his birthday tomorrow. Police do not understand what drove the mother to stab the little boy who died on Sunday night

Where it happened: Deputies got a call for a family disturbance at 12:50 a.m. Sunday morning from the 500 block of Highland Loop Drive in Poteet near San Antonio

Soward wouldn't say what their relationship to Caldwell is, but he did confirm that the other child had minor scratches from the incident.

Authorities said Caldwell made two admissions about the stabbing, both to officers who first arrived at the scene and later in an official statement. Soward would not comment on a motive for the stabbing Sunday, saying it was under investigation.

Soward said the scene was one of the more difficult his investigators had encountered.

'It's very tragic. It's hard on everyone involved — even the most seasoned officers,' he said. 'It's something you don't ever forget because it's so senseless. There's not a more innocent victim than a child, and for his life to be snuffed out because of actions of his mother is just unbelievable.'
