An Egyptian doctor and the father of a 13-year-old female genital mutilation victim have gone on trial after the youngster died during the barbaric procedure.

Soheir al-Bata'a suffered an allergic reaction to penicillin following the illegal operation in the Nile Delta medical clinic  in June 2013.

Dr Raslan Fadl and the victim's father Mohamed did not attend the first day of the trial in the northern town of Aga  where they are accused of illegally mutilating the youngster as well as her manslaughter.

According 
to the Daily Telegraph, the trial has been adjourned until July 10 when 
the judge is expected to return a guilty verdict.

It
 is understood that Dr Fadl faces a £40 fine and up to seven years in 
prison while the victim's father can receive a maximum of six months.

According
 to Human Rights group Equality Now, Dr Fadl made several attempts to 
block the investigation, even paying the family more than £5,000 to drop
 the case.

The
 victim's father changed his statement to match Dr Fadl claiming his 
daughter had been brought to the clinic to receive treatment for genital
 warts.

Equality Now believes Dr Fadl is still performing procedures from his apartment beside the clinic.

It
 is understood that he performed between eight and ten procedures in his
 clinic a day - despite FGM being outlawed in Egypt in 2008.

Suad 
Abu-Dayyeh, Middle East and North Africa Consultant for Equality Now 
said: 'Equality Now and our partners in Egypt are glad that the Egyptian
 authorities continues the process to ensure justice for Soheir.

'We
 continue to monitor the court proceedings to make sure that those 
responsible for Soheir’s mutilation and death are held accountable. As 
in the UK, this first ever FGM prosecution sends out a strong message 
that it will not be tolerated. '

According
 to Unicef, nine out of ten Egyptian women aged between 15 and 49 have 
undergone the procedure, which can cost as little as £2.50. 

More than 70 per cent of the operations in Egypt are still performed by doctors.
