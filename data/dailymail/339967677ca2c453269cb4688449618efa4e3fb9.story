Chelsea's Andre Schurrle is now just one step from the World Cup final and says he is being supported every inch of the way by another Stamford Bridge German who didn’t quite make it to the biggest game in football.

Michael Ballack was Germany captain in 2002 and he scored the winning goal in the semi-final against South Korea. But he also picked up a booking ruling him out of the final.

Schurrle was a 12-year-old fan at the time. He went on to play for Bayer Leverkusen – alongside Ballack in 2011 – and then for Chelsea just like his hero, now he can outdo his idol by playing in the final next Sunday at the Maracana.

Eyes on the prize: Andre Schurrle's Germany take on Brazil for a place in the World Cup final

Aspirations: Should Schurrle play in the final at the Maracana he'll have done something his hero and mentor Michael Ballack didn't

'We have stayed in touch throughout the World Cup,' he said. 'He has sent me a messages before every game of the tournament and when I get back on the team bus there are usually messages too. We are in touch and the support helps me.'

A revenge of sorts will be on the cards on Tuesday in Belo Horizonte when Germany face Brazil for only the second time in World Cup history. And with Miroslav Klose likely to step back down to the substitutes’ bench Schurrle could be in line for start.

'Now I am one step closer to achieving what Ballack managed to achieve in his career,' he says. 'I want to get to the final and win the tournament. That was our goal right from the beginning.'

Germany’s chances are boosted by the absence of Brazil’s talisman and top scorer Neymar. In light of Neymar’s injury Schurrle’s Chelsea team-mates Oscar, Willian and Ramires could all now have an even bigger role to play.

Schurrle said the Brazilian contingent in the Chelsea squad have spoken about nothing but the World Cup for the past few months, proud of hosting the tournament but also bearing the added pressure of a nation’s expectations.

Big decision: Referee Urs Meier shows Ballack the yellow card that meant he missed the 2002 World Cup final

Support: The Chelsea and Germany legend has kept in touch with Schurrle before each World Cup match

'They are well aware that whenever they go out on to the pitch there are millions of people watching them on television,' Schurrle said. 'They are handling it very well because it is not easy to play with this pressure. The Brazilians at Chelsea started to talk about the World Cup about two months before.

'They are proud to have the tournament in their country and we all saw what Brazil was like last year when they won the Confederations Cup and how it brought the whole nation together.'

The expectations are with Brazil but the belief is increasingly with Germany, according to Schurrle. 

'We have this feeling that we are close to going all the way,' he says.

It’s now a long time since he came through at Mainz 05 with Ballack the player he most looked up to.

Doing what his hero never managed to do would be a great way to head back to Chelsea for the new season for a campaign that will kick-off without another one of his role models, Frank Lampard.

On fire: Luiz celebrates scoring the remarkable free-kick which ultimately saw Brazil beat Costa Rica

'It’s very sad for all the fans to lose someone who is a Chelsea legend but he had achieved everything at the club,' he says of the England midfielder who has played his last Chelsea game.

'Everybody loved him, I certainly loved playing alongside him. He was one of my idols when I was young and it was an honour to be his team-mate for one year.'

There will be reinforcements and the £18million purchase from Bayer Leverkusen last summer has been buoyed by the acquisitions of Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa in this summer’s market.

'They are both very good players and everybody’s happy that we have signed them. But I am so focused on the World Cup I don’t think I will think about the new season until I am on holiday.'

Hopefully for Chelsea’s German forward by the time he lies back on his lounger he will have played in a World Cup final and picked up the winner’s medal his hero Ballack was never able to get his hands on.

Hero: Schurrle said he loved playing with Frank Lampard, who won't be at Chelsea when he returns to England
