British travellers suffer some of the highest rates of flight delays in Europe, and are owed up to £185 million in compensation from airlines.

Statistics released by passenger rights specialist refund.me reveal that one in every four passengers in the UK are affected by delays of at least 15 minutes, the second highest number in Europe, behind one in every 3 French passengers.

It is estimated that as many as 575,000 Britons could be eligible to claim compensation for delays, cancellations, missed connections and overbooking by airlines, but few actually do.

Payout: British travellers are entitled to up to £185 million in unclaimed compensation for delayed flights

Across Europe, more than two million delayed passengers could be entitled to claim compensation from airlines worth approximately £665 million, judging by statistics on delayed or cancelled flights.

Following France and the UK, one in every five Germans, and one in every six Spaniards suffer flight disruptions. 

Charles de Gaulle in Paris is the worst European airport for delayed flights, with the highest number of any airport during the month of August. It is followed by London Heathrow and Istanbul Ataturk, then Frankfurt, Amsterdam and Paris Orly.

Heathrow is the worst offender for cancelling flights though, followed by Frankfurt and then Charles de Gaulle.

All flights that leave from an EU airport, regardless of airline or destination, are covered by EU Regulations EC 261/2004 which guarantees eligible passengers compensation of up to £475 for disruptions. Likewise, passengers entering the EU on flights operated by EU carriers are also covered.

Despite this, airlines often avoid paying out by blaming disruptions on causes such as unspecified technical issues and severe weather conditions.

As little as two per cent of eligible passengers successfully receive compensation, meaning that an estimated £185 million per year has gone unclaimed, totally more than £3.5 billion in total since the regulation was introduced ten years ago.

Compensation: EU regulation dictates that passengers are entitled to up to £475 for disruptions

Battle: In June budget airline Jet2 lost a three-year battle to avoid paying compensation to passenger

In June, the UK courts ruled in favour of a passenger who fought a  three year legal battle with  Jet2 to prove that the low-cost airline was unfounded in claiming that routine technical problems could be considered ‘extraordinary circumstances.’ The airline has now applied to appeal the decision in the Supreme Court.

'The recent ruling of the courts is a positive step that should encourage more passengers to stand up to airlines and assert their rights,' says Eve Buechner, founder and CEO of refund.me. 

'Nevertheless, on the whole awareness remains relatively low, something that airlines take full advantage of to avoid paying out. We want to change that.'
