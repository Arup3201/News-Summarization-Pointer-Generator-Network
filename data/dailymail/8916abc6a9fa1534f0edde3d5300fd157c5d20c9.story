It was almost the perfect start. A pinpoint cross from Raheem Sterling, movement to win a free header… and straight into Hugo Lloris’ arms.

Again within the first 15 minutes, Mario Balotelli found himself with the goal at his mercy, but his heading was found wanting for a second time, the ball directed tamely wide.

A dream debut duo it may not have been, but in those chances alone Balotelli showed he’s more than capable of fitting into Brendan Rodgers’ attack.

Already, he showed he offers Liverpool a new dimension. The relationship between Liverpool’s front three of Balotelli, Sterling and Sturridge is in its infancy, but the plan is clear to see.

Balotelli runs through the middle, holding the ball up and driving attacking moves forward, with the more nimble English duo dovetailing either side.

The No 45 showed he is more than up to that challenge, with possibly his most impressive moment in the first half being holding off the not-inconsiderable Younes Kaboul just inside Liverpool’s half before sprinting past the Spurs defender with a trademark change of pace. 

It was a 20 seconds that typified his performance, with the end shot bobbling wide of a goal shorn of the onrushing Lloris.

The stroke of half-time saw the striker in tune with Liverpool’s style yet again, working a training ground corner routine perfectly before lashing Steven Gerrard’s delivery over the bar. 

There were no histrionics, either, when Eric Dier unleashed a challenge best described as ‘lively’ after the Italian had chased a lost ball down on the flank.

After recovering from the sliding tackle, Balotelli made no mention of the Phil Dowd’s ludicrous decision not to award a free-kick.

It’s early days but Rodgers will be hoping he keeps that cool head. 

Winning those headers and pulling defenders out of the way offers Rodgers a weapon he didn't have at his disposal last season. Luis Suarez was a tour de force of attacking prowess - and will be for Barcelona - but wasn't a target man in the same way Balotelli is.  

Suarez would interlink with Sturridge and Sterling to create last season's potent, free-flowing mix of piercing attack and speed.

With Balotelli, none of the speed and threat is diminished, but it adds a real focal point, a solid presence in the middle of the attack for his English partners in crime to play off.

That's not to say the Italian's movement was static - far from it. His heat map from his hour on the pitch before being replaced by Lazar Markovic shows touches from all over the pitch.

He can be a crucial component of the lightning-quick Liverpool, adding power, menace and thought to an attack admired by all last season. His holding up of the ball and early understanding with Sterling and Sturridge had all the hallmarks of being £16million well gambled.

If only he'd bought his shooting boots.
