A manager of a petrol station is being investigated after he allegedly smashed the windscreen of a grandmother's car with a fire bucket over a row about short changing her.

The company that runs the service station in Cosham, near Portsmouth in Hampshire, said it was 'disappointed' the manager had failed to adopt their 'non-confrontational approach in dealing with a customer complaint.' 

Joanne Smith, 49, said she was scared and shocked when the manager emptied the fire bucket of sand and used it to smash the windscreen of the car while she, her daughter and grandchildren sat inside.

The incident took place as the 49-year-old stopped off at a BP petrol station so she could fill up with petrol before taking her grandchildren to school. 

She said: 'I had my daughter and two grandchildren in the car and I remember I had £20 to get petrol, as well as bread and milk from the shops.

'That's why I knew I would get £10 back as I needed it later on.

'I said 'sir you have only given me change for £10, I gave you £20,' but he wasn't having any of it.

'I asked if he could check the till receipt or the CCTV because I was sure of the money I gave him, but he refused.'

The windscreen was left badly smashed after the incident and police are investigating Mrs Smith's claims

Mrs Smith said she then called the police to report the incident, who told her it was a civil matter and she should speak to Trading Standards.

She added: 'I wasn't happy with that.

'I admit I then provoked the situation because I wasn't happy and took a can of oil from the shelf and went and sat in my car until the police arrived.

The manager allegedly hit the car with the bucket

'A short while later the manager came over, emptied a fire bucket that was full of sand outside, and smashed my windscreen.

'I was scared and shocked at what had happened and can't afford to get it repaired.'

Hampshire Police attended the incident and confirmed they are investigating a case of criminal damage. The force said no-one has been arrested.

The BP petrol station is run by firm MRH retail.

David Hathaway, group company secretary of MRH, said: 'Inspection of our till records indicate the customer did make a £20 cash payment and it appears once the disagreement began it quickly escalated.

'We're conducting our own investigation into the matter but because this is still in its early stages we are not prepared to discuss the details at this time.

'Nevertheless, based upon the evidence from our till records, we will be contacting the customer to refund to her the £10 of additional change that she is due from her transaction.

'We're disappointed the manager of the service station failed to observe our policy of adopting a non-confrontational approach when dealing with a customer complaint.

'While this type of mistake is unusual it does occasionally happen in all retail environments.

'In the rare event one of our customers considers they have not been given the correct amount of change, our policy is to try to resolve the customer's concern accurately, quickly and calmly at the point of sale.'
