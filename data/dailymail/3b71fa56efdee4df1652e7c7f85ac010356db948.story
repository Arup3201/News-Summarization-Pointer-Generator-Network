They dress up in extravagant gowns and parade up and down the catwalk getting judged in various rounds such as active wear, talent and evening wear.

But this isn't a Miss America contest or even a scene from Toddlers & Tiaras - but a beauty pageant for little dogs.

The factual photo series comes from famous dog photographer Sophie Gamand, famous for her wet dog series and her pit bulls in flower garlands.

The French artist captured events during the 2013 and 2014 Doggies and Tiaras Pageant in New York City for her latest project called Dog Pageant.

In the charitable
pageant, 18-30 dogs compete in various categories in front of judges and a spectator crowd
 of people - usually with their dogs.

Eventually there is a winner of the title 'NYC Doggies & Tiaras 2013 grand prize winner', and four runners-up.

Each judge scores from 1-10 in each category and the dog with the highest score wins the grand prize.

It costs £45 to enter a dog (escorted by their owner) into the contest.

Sophie
 captures owners carefully preparing their pets for presentation, finding new and 
intricate ways of showcasing their pet's talents and outfits.

Doggies and Tiaras was founded in 2012 to help local shelters while having fun with your dog

Dogs compete in categories such as active wear, talent, most entertaining and glamour

In her 
series dogs are seen backstage, getting pampered and ready to shine with
 their 'mothers' - or Doggie Moms - in a brief spotlight.

Sophie is an active supporter of dog rescue groups and says her work 'explores the relationship between dogs and people'.

She observes that the puppy pageants are more about the owners than their pets.

'The
 Doggie Moms disappear behind their dog. But, in a similar fashion to 
the kids' pageants, the focus may appear to be on the dogs, but isn't 
the show really about their moms?' writes Sophie.

Participants are limited to 60 seconds on stage for all categories

Some contestants are far larger than the little chihuahuas commonly seen being glammed up

'The [so-called] Doggie moms are women 
(and sometimes men) carrying dressed up toy dogs in purses everywhere 
they go.

'Through
 their dogs they meet regularly, often for animal-related charity 
events, and for each occasion have their dog wear bedazzled outfits worth hundreds of dollars.

'Pet fashion designers and pet stylists have emerged, to provide this crowd with more and more garments and accessories.

'It
 is a thriving business where designers compete and the Doggie Moms, who
 sometimes act like Stage Moms, would do anything to see their dogs in 
the spotlight.

'Many of these dogs even have their own Facebook page.'
