Patients treated over the phone rather than face-to-face are far more likely to seek further medical help, a study has found.

Telephone consultations with a GP meant they were 50 per cent more likely to call again, turn up at A&E or try to see a doctor out-of-hours.

The figure was much higher for those who spoke to a practice nurse – with the vast majority needing further help.

Time-wasting: The Government study found that telephone consultations with GPs do not save money

The Department of Health-funded study concluded that phone consultations do not save any money – and actually create more work, rather than less, for GPs.

They also lead to practice nurses taking 100 times more phone calls than usual.

The study, the first of its kind in the world, comes as the NHS places more and more emphasis on telephone care.

One in eight GP consultations is now done over the phone – four times as many as 15 years ago. With a quarter of patients waiting more than a week for an appointment and one in ten giving up all together, the Government is encouraging contact by phone, email and even by Skype video conference calls.

But there is concern that symptoms will be missed and patients will be misdiagnosed, sometimes with deadly consequences.

Some patients may simply get flustered on the phone – and call back to get the answers they need. Professor John Campbell of Exeter University, who led the latest study, said telephone consultations were ‘basically safe’ but not a ‘silver bullet’.

He added: ‘The ability to manage people effectively over the phone is probably limited.

‘There are some people you can manage but most people end up coming back into the system.’

Prof Campbell looked at the effect of ‘telephone triage’ across 42 GP practices in Bristol, Exeter, Norwich and Warwick. A third saw patients face-to-face, while the other two groups carried out phone consultations with a doctor or a nurse.

Traditional: Patients often end up needing a face-to-face service anyway after the phonecalls

About half of patients using the normal system wanted more help or support within the next four weeks. But the number rose to 75 per cent when telephone triage with a GP was used. The figure was 88 per cent with a nurse.

While doctors saw fewer patients face-to-face, they took ten times as many phone calls as usual. Nurses took 100 times as many, medical journal the Lancet reports. The analysis also found that patients called by nurses spent longer in hospital if they were admitted and were less satisfied – likely because they really wanted to speak to a GP.

There were seven deaths among the phone triage patients – compared to just one among those treated as usual. But researchers say these deaths were not due to the type of consultation.

Prof Campbell said phone triage may not represent ‘the most efficient’ use of time and urged practices think carefully before setting it up.

He added: ‘You cannot just introduce triage and think you are going to manage all the GP workload. It is a much more complex situation.’ The charity Patient Concern said many patients prefer to use the phone rather than take time off work to visit the surgery.

But the British Medical Association said many conditions can safely be treated only by direct examination and called for enough medical staff to deal with the rising demand for appointments among an ageing population.

Labour’s shadow health minister Andrew Gwynne said the study proves the need for more face-to-face GP appointments.

The Department of Health said it was offering 7.5million more people email, Skype and evening and weekend slots. A spokesman said: ‘GPs know what works best for their patients so can tailor their services as they see fit and based on what patients need.’
