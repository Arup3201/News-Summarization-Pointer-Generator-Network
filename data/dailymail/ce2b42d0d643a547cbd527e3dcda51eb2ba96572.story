A 20-year-old Texas man who was convicted of raping of a teenage schoolmate but sentenced to only five years' probation must also undergo the standard probationary conditions, including evaluation for sex offender treatment, a Dallas district court judge ruled Thursday.

Sir Young pleaded guilty to the attack on a 14-year-old girl at a Dallas high school in 2011.

Judge Jeanine Howard, who sentenced Young last week, did not impose the standard probationary conditions.

She said he was 'not your typical sex offender' and questioned whether the girl had embellished her story. He was ordered to spend 45 days in jail.

The sentence and the judge's comments sparked outrage and Howard recused herself from the case.

On Thursday, Judge Carter Thompson imposed all of the standard terms of probation, meaning Young may not have any contact with children, must be evaluated for sex offender treatment and must stay away from pornography.

Thompson told Young that he must adhere to the probation measures.

'Your previous court gave you a second chance, don't expect a third chance from this court,' he said.

Thompson made 'in our estimation the right ruling, he did the right thing,' Dallas District Attorney Craig Watkins said after the ruling.

Watkins' office had asked Thompson to tighten the probation conditions.

Young's attorney, Scottie Allen, said he and his client were disappointed by Thursday's ruling.

Judge Jeanine Howard caused further outrage after the light sentence, by telling The Dallas Morning News: 'She wasn't the victim she claimed to be. He is not your typical sex offender.

'There are rape cases that deserve life. There are rape cases that deserve 20 years.

'Every now and then you have on of those that deserve probation. This is one of those and I stand by it.'

Prosecutor Josh Healy said Young's victim, who is now 17, had been left in tears by the ruling.

He said she and her family told him they were 'shocked'Â  and 'extremely disappointed'.

But Judge Howard told the newspaper she gave the sentence because medical records indicated the girl had three sexual partners and had given birth to a baby - something the victim's family denies.

Dallas County District Attorney Craig Watkins said his prosecutors had pushed for five years' prison time.

The initial punishment for Young sparked a backlash when a prior judge in Dallas sentenced him to five years of probation and declined to impose standard conditions of probation for sex offenders
