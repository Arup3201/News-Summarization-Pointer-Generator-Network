Australia has a new claim to fame: being the most popular country in the world on Instagram.

The official tourism Australia page @Australia has just amassed over one million followers, making it easily the most followed national destination page in the world.

The page, which is run by a small team of social media experts, has blown the completion out of the water, with it's British counterpart carrying only 131,000 followers, and the New Zealand account having only 30,000.

It features stunning images of quintessentially Australian icons like Kangaroos, Koalas and distinctly rugged landscapes, with many of the images garnering over 50,000 likes.

The small team runs through thousands of images posted on the account every day, with users posting the hashtag #seeAustralia to have the shot viewed by the team.

The top images are then selected daily, with some of them receiving in excess of 50,000 likes. The most popular images are of quintessentially Australian icons like Kangaroos, Koalas and distinctly rugged landscapes.

Tourism Australia Managing Director John O'Sullivan told Daily Mail Australia 'This type of advocacy is incredibly valuable to us - it's an increasingly important and cost effective part of our overall destination marketing strategy.' 

'Our followers are posting these images because they have a genuine desire to share their many personal and positive Australian holiday experiences and, by doing so, play a part in promoting a country they love,' he said.

He said the large following of the page allows the company to broadcast their product to a global audience. 

'This is great for Australian tourism and particularly for those operators who are positively embracing social media and using platforms such as our Instagram page to promote their own tourism business,' Mr O'Sullivan said.

In a recent survey on the Instagram account, 91 per cent of @Australia followers said posting images on the site said they thought posting their photos on Instagram could help promote travel to Australia, while a further 87 per cent said it would influence them to travel the country more. 

One Australian ex-pat who responded to the survye said : 'Love your page! I'm Australian living in London, and I use your page to showcase Australia to all my English friends.' 

Another American follower wrote: 'I never thought I would want to go to Australia before I joined Instagram. Now I can't imagine not going! So beautiful.'

'This research shows that the incredible images that we receive and share daily provide inspiration to Australians and international travellers alike to visit and explore our country. 

'Our Instagram page is inspiring would be visitors to take the next step and find out more,' Mr O'Sullivan said.

Earlier this year, Travel Industry website Skift looked at 2000 accounts of Instagram destinations, and found that Australia got an average of 8200.

Jason Clampet, Skift co-founder, told Traveller the popularity of the page can be attributed to the the management.

'Tourism Australia social media team figured out a way to encourage people to share their photos and then broadcast them back to travellers who may be dreaming of a trip one day, or just got back from one, or are trying to decide if they want to go or not,' he said.
