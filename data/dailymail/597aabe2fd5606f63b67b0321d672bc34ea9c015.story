Starbucks has announced that it's introducing a new holiday drink - the Chestnut Praline Latte - giving the Pumpkin Spice Latte a run for its money.

The frothy concoction, which will debut nationwide on November 12, combines espresso with steamed milk, caramelized chestnut flavor and spices.

It's then topped off with whipped cream and spiced praline crumbs.

Generating buzz: The Chestnut Praline Latte, which combines espresso with steamed milk, caramelized chestnut flavor and spices, will launch at Starbucks on November 12

The coffee giant notes that it's the 'first new holiday handcrafted beverage in five years,' joining cold-weather offerings such as the Peppermint Mocha, Gingerbread Latte and Caramel Brulee Latte. 

While the drink's launch is still a few weeks away, some customers already tried it last year when it was released in select cities, sharing their reactions on social media.

'Drank a Starbucks Chestnut Praline Latte & now all I can think about are fireplaces & pine trees & ugly sweaters & beautiful Christmas break,' tweeted Lauren Hallowell in November.

'Holy moly, the #Starbucks chestnut praline latte may be my new favorite holiday beverage!,' Alison Bourg wrote on Instagram a month later.

A recent press release explained that the brand is trying to 'transform and elevate' the Starbucks experience this holiday season.

'Holiday 2013 witnessed a seismic shift in consumer behavior in which many traditional brick-and-mortar retailers experienced a decline in foot traffic compared to significant growth in online shopping,' CEO Howard Schultz said in a statement.

'Since that time, we have been focused on radically redefining the Starbucks retail experience for our partners, customers and stores,' he added.

Last year, Starbucks announced that it had sold more than 200 million Pumpkin Spice Lattes - its most buzzed-about seasonal drink.

The drink, introduced in 2003, is a combination of espresso, pumpkin-flavored syrup and steamed milk. It's topped with sweetened whipped cream and spices such as cinnamon,nutmeg and clove.

The Pumpkin Spice Latte has inspired cult-like devotion: Two years ago, a temporary shortage of pumpkin spice syrup in some locations caused an outcry on social media. And last fall, one customer started a petition on Change.org asking the brand to create a vegan version of the drink.
