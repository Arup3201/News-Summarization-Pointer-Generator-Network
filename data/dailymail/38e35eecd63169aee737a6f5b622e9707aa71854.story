As he smiled widely and waved at the excited crowds while holding up the Olympic torch, Lewis Hamilton showed no outward signs that he had only managed a few hours sleep.

The Formula One star was snapped leaving a London nightclub in the early hours of this morning, but still managed to make it to Luton for an impressively early 6:30 am start.

He joined a host of celebrities including singer Rihanna at nightspot Bijous, and then moved on to exclusive club Jalouse before leaving at 4:06am.

After arriving at the town this morning, he joked that he would have liked to have swapped his disappointing British Grand Prix  finish yesterday for carrying the Olympic flame in his home town.

The
McLaren Mercedes driver and 2008 Formula 1 champion had been due to 
carry the torch as it passed through Stevenage, the Hertfordshire town 
where he grew up.

But he swapped carrying the torch to today because of the clash with the race at Silverstone

After starting today's Olympic Torch Relay in Luton, Hamilton, 27, joked that he would have liked to have carried it yesterday after all.

It followed a disappointing eighth-place finish which leaves him fourth in the championship.

'It wasn't that great a day, so I would happily have missed that to come and do it that evening,' he said.

'But I am so proud to do it, it doesn't matter where I do it.'

Describing the response from fans in the town centre as 'phenomenal', he added: 'To be nominated to do this is a real honour, I never in a million years thought I would have a chance to do it'

On its 53rd day travelling the country, the Olympic Torch will go from the dreaming spires of Oxford, past Abingdon, Henley-on-Thames, Maidenhead and Slough to Reading in Berkshire.

Describing the response from fans in the town centre as 'phenomenal', he added: 'To be nominated to do this is a real honour, I never in a million years thought I would have a chance to do it.'

He said he had bought his torch and planned to keep it above his mantelpiece.

Hundreds of people, many of them schoolchildren, turned out to see Lewis start Day 52 of the relay in pole position, gathering for the start in St George's Square and along his 300m leg just after 6.30am.

It took him slightly longer than the three seconds it would take in his F1 car before he handed over to local student Hollie Baxter, 17, who suffers from Rubinstein Taybi Syndrome and has been in a wheelchair since she was 11.

Meanwhile the mascots for the London 2012 Olympics - which will supposedly provide a £13billion boost for the British economy- are under fire.

They are rolling off a production line in Dafeng, China, almost 6,000 miles away from London.

The factory has shipped nearly 500,000 toys to Britain ahead of the Olympic Games opening ceremony later this month.

Games organisers have faced questions
over the decision to award the contract for the mascots to a company 
which manufactures abroad instead of using British workers.

And campaigners have accused them of turning a blind eye to a ‘sweatshop bonanza’.

Olympics
organisers expect to rake in £1billion in revenue and £86million profit
from 2012 souvenirs, and the mascot toys are expected to be among the 
most popular. Prices for the toys start at £12.

But
despite their claims that the Games will benefit British business, 
lucrative contracts worth millions of pounds and thousands of jobs have 
gone abroad.

An investigation by the Mail earlier 
this year found that just nine per cent of the 194 products available on
the London 2012 website were made in Britain.

China made almost two-thirds of the official merchandise, including models of London buses and taxis emblazoned with the Union Jack.

T-shirts displaying London landmarks are made in Pakistan, Team GB gym bags in Vietnam and Union Jack photo frames in Poland.

Organisers Locog point to the fact that 90 per cent of the licensees are British companies.

But many, including the official mascot licensee Golden Bear, manufacture abroad.

The 33-year-old company is based in Telford, Shropshire, but moved its manufacturing base to China in 1987 to save money.

It now has 10 factories in China and has taken on extra staff to cope with the demand for toys featuring Wenlock and Mandeville, the mascots for the Olympics and Paralympics respectively, and Team GB mascot ‘Pride the Lion’.

The company promised an investigation earlier this year following claims that workers in one of its

China factories were paid just 18p per item, or 26p per hour, and were working more than 11 hours a day.

It said the factory had passed inspections by the International Council of Toy Industries.
