The parents of a seven-year-old Burmese refugee who was raped and beaten to death have broken down in tears as her killer was convicted of the heinous crime.

Esar Met, 26, also a Burmese refugee, was convicted on Friday of kidnapping and murdering Hser Ner Moo in Salt Lake City in March 2008. But prosecutors have not asked for the death penalty due to a language barrier - an issue that has already caused nearly six years of costly legal delays.

Instead, Met faces 20 years to prison in life when he is sentenced on May 7.

As jurors, who appeared as if they had been crying, delivered their verdict, Hser's mother, Pearlly Wa, could be heard sobbing in the gallery.

Guilty: Esar Met is handcuffed at the conclusion of his murder trial in Salt Lake City on Friday. He was found guilty of kidnapping and murdering seven-year-old Hser Ner Moo, who vanished in 2008

'Still no more daughter,' Hser's
 father, Cartoon Wah, said outside the courtroom, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. 'My only daughter is still no 
more.'

Hser Ner Moo was found dead in a pool of her blood at the bottom
 of Met's shower in 2008.

In the nine-day trial, child abuse expert Lori Frasier testified that the little girl suffered an excruciating death and had gruesome injuries to her genitals, as well as a broken arm.

'This would have been terrible pain for 
her,' Frasier testified, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. 'This kind of injury would have required force.'

Mikal Wersland, a sergeant with the 
South Salt Lake Police Department who had helped search for the little 
girl after she vanished, also gave emotional testimony as he recounted 
how a colleague called him to say they had found the girl's body the day
 after they began looking for her.

'They
 told me they found what they believed to be blood evidence in the 
stairwell of one of the apartments we hadnâ€™t been able to search,' he 
said, using a tissue to wipe tears.

'I
 just thought about this poor family and having to - just the thought of
 having to tell this family what had happened to their little girl.'

Missed: Hser Ner Moo was kidnapped, raped and beaten by a man she had grown to trust, prosecutors said

Heartbroken: Hser's mother Pearlly Wa, pictured in November 2012, sobbed as Met was convicted

Loss: Cartoon Wah, pictured in 2012, said losing his daughter has been the worst experience of his life

Hser's heartbroken parents gave their
 own emotional testimony earlier last week as they sobbed about how much
 they missed their only daughter.

'She was my one, my only one,' her 
father, Cartoon Wah, said through an interpreter on Wednesday, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.

'I have lost many things in my life, but this 
was the biggest loss of my life... Now I have to carry on living with 
this broken heart and support my family.'

Before moving to Utah, the family had fled the Burmese jungle for a crowded refugee camp in Thailand, which later burned down.

Her father recounted their fears as they waited for news of their missing daughter.

'The night [she disappeared] my 
wife was crying,' Wah said. 'It had been too long, so we assumed, we 
thought maybe our daughter is already dead.'

Gruesome: Another image shows blood against a wall in the bathroom where her body was discovered

Scene: Hser and her family lived at this South Salt Lake complex, where she reportedly befriended Met

His wife, Pearlly Wah, sobbed as she added: 'This is the biggest loss of my life. If you
 gave me the whole world of happiness to exchange for this little girl, I
 would say no. Nothing can pay me back because I only had one. Whenever I
 see little girls run around, it breaks my heart.'

Hser was killed on March 31, 2008 
after she wandered from her parents' home at the same complex, telling 
an aunt she was going to play downstairs.

But when she failed to return home, her parents grew anxious when they couldn't find her.

The
 couple, who only speak their native language of Karen, contacted their 
case worker who in turn called police. The little girl's body was found 
the following day.

Met was arrested and charged with first-degree felony counts of child kidnapping and aggravated murder.

Locked up: Met, who listened to the trial through an interpreter, faces life behind bars when he is sentenced

Emotional: South Salt Lake Police's Mikal Wersland became emotional as he spoke about the desperate search for Hser in March 2008 and how he and his colleagues feared she would be found dead

Painful memories: Carrie Pender, the family's caseworker, testified on Thursday and recalled the look of pain on Hser's mother's face as the family desperately searched for the missing girl in March 2008

Defense lawyers had argued that no one saw Met 
take or kill Hser and that DNA found from his jacket and from beneath 
her fingernails were from games the two had shared in days before the 
murder.

Met, who had also been living in a 
Burmese refugee camp in Thailand before moving to the U.S., moved to the
 apartment about a month before the slaying.

He
 lived at the house with four roommates, but defense attorneys say they 
shunned him because he was a Muslim man of Indian origin.

The
 roommates were arrested on April 1, 2008 but they were later released. 
Police said they had not been home at the time of the killing and did 
not know her body was in the basement bathroom.
