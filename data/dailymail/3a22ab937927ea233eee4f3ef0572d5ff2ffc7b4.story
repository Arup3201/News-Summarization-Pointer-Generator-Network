Walking up the aisle is arguably the biggest day of your life. With all eyes on you and photographs you'll cherish forever, there's a fair amount of pressure to look good on your wedding day, but how far would you go - and how much would you shell out - to ensure you look picture-perfect?

One magazine editor went to great lengths, spending £5,766 on three months-worth of procedures and treatments to look polished - and the results are amazing.

Claudia Waterson, 36, the deputy editor of Brides magazine, imagined she was a bride-to-be to test out what treatments were worth investing in - and which ones should be avoided - for her readers.

Claudia Waterson, 36, pictured, left, before, and, right, after three months worth of treatments, imagined she was a bride-to-be to test out what treatments were worth investing in - and which ones should be avoided

She had a few key areas she wanted to address: her broken nose, her neglected skin and her 'wonky' teeth. She spoke to her beauty journalist friends and compiled a list of the must-have products and treatments. 

She kicked off her bridal makeover by overhauling her skincare routine based on the beauty gurus' recommendations.

She added a range of products to her collection, including lotions and potions from La Prairie, Estee Lauder, Creme de la Mer and Bobbi Brown, at a cost of £489. She complemented her new skincare regime with a £200 facial by Su-Man.

'It turns out if you buy the right products for you and use them correctly, they will work,' she said. 

Right she was - she noticed reduced lines and plumper skin. 

She also visited Headmasters for a hair makeover at a cost of £140. After switching between blonde and brown over the years, she was convinced she'd never be able to achieve glossy blonde locks without drying out her hair.

Speaking about her final look, she said: 'The change in my confidence has been the real shock. These treatments were right for me; they're subtle and pretty... I challenge anyone not to say my face has improved'

After a balayage session, where colour is applied freestyle by hand, she was back at her blonde best. 

Defined brows came courtesy of global chain, Browhaus, where she had her brows and eyelashes tinted and groomed for a cool £608.

Dr Uchenna Okoye's Quick Fix Bridal Makeover was the obvious choice for helping her achieve the smile of her dreams.

Her teeth were whitened by a staggering 11 shades and smoothed and rounded at a cost of £2,379. 'My smile, and confidence, have improved, without the lead time of major orthodontics,' she said after the treatment.

She opted to have her lips made fuller via a £660 lip enhancement treatment courtesy of Dr Rakus.

She said: 'Despite the bruise, my upper lip is fuller yet so natural looking. Some 36 years of average lips and now I have a pout I can paint.'

Claudia  also wanted to fix her nose, which was broken and 'given a funny angle' by a netball incident in her childhood.

Cosmetic specialist Dr Tapan Patel, medical director at the PHI Clinic in London, suggested a £495 non-surgical rhinoplasty, where filler is injected into the nose to correct deformities - and she was thrilled with the results. 

Her final treatment was a £795 'liquid lift' by Dr Prager, who developed it to sculpt, tighten and contour the face.

Speaking after the three months, Claudia said: 'I embarked on this feature with the mind of a writer who has worked in magazines a long time, and seen a million different beauty claims. 

'And I was cautious I didn’t become the Bride Of Wildenstein (Google it. Scary). But the results speak for themselves, I think. Even my other half was forced to admit I look better! 

'The change in my confidence has been the real shock, though. (I didn’t think that I was un-confident before?!) These treatments were right for me; they’re subtle and pretty. 

'It’s about knowing what’s right for you. And I challenge anyone not to say my face has improved.'
