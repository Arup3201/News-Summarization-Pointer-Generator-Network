So Yeon Ryu came from a stroke behind fellow South Korean Inbee Park to capture her first individual World Ladies Championship title at Mission Hills on Sunday.

Ryu carded a closing 69 on the par-73 Blackstone Course to finish on 13 under par, one shot ahead of team-mate Park. The pair were runaway winners of the team competition for the second successive year, finishing 15 shots ahead of Norway's Marianne Skarpnord and Suzann Pettersen.

'I didn't expect that I had a chance to win this tournament, because in the second and first rounds, I didn't play really well,' Ryu said. 'Fortunately I was able to shoot eight under in the third round so after that I was in contention.'

China's Lei Ye, who is just 13 years old, finished in 55th place to win the amateur competition.

'I played really well the first day and that gave me more room to make the cut,' she said.

'I've noticed from playing in professional tournaments that putting is my weakness. I hope to improve and turn professional someday.'
