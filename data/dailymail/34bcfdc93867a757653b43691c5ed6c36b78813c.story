Outgoing Representative Michele Bachmann joined the flurry of former Republican presidential candidates tossing their name into the ring for 2016 on Tuesday. 

Bachmann told Real Clear Politics that the media has been wrong not to include her in 2016 speculation thus far because she may give the presidency another go.

'The only thing that the media has speculated on is that it’s going to be various men that are running,' she said after the poling website asked her if woman would enter the horse race. 'They haven’t speculated, for instance, that I’m going to run.

'What if I decide to run? And there’s a chance I could run,' she said.

If Bachmann did run again, she would be one of 
several 2012 presidential candidates seeking a do-over and one of as many as a dozen Republicans vying for her party's nomination.

Party like its 2012: Rep. Michele Bachmann, pictured here at the Faith & Freedom Coalition's Road to Majority Conference in June, says there's a 'chance' she'll run for president again in 2016. If she does, she'll likely be one of several former candidates in the GOP primary

Mitt Romney claims he's not running again, but anything can happen in politics

Rick Perry said this weekend he's 'preparing for the possibility of a presidential run'

Rick Santorum said Tuesday he's 'definitely considering' another run

Texas Governor Rick Perry and former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum have both indicated that they are considering future campaigns, too.

At a book signing in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, last night, Santorum said he was 'definitely considering' another campaign will make a decision 'sometime next year.'

In the meantime, the 2012 candidate, said he's not 'doing anything inconsistent with running for president.'

Santorum, whose been saying for the last year that he's 'open' to another presidential campaign, reportedly chalked up his busy travel schedule to the promotion of his book, Blue Collar Conservatism, which was released at the end of April.

Pennsylvania news website Pennlive.com said Santorum also cited the book tour as his excuse for a visit to all-important presidential primary state Iowa in two weeks - his second in the last eight months.

Perry has also made the mecca to Iowa recently, attending a church service and a local Republican Party gathering there over the weekend.

While there, he admitted to the Washington Post that he's eying another presidential run.  

'I try not to be perceived as being coy,' he said. 'I am preparing for the possibility of a presidential run.'

'Yes, I think 
about it, and I know how to be prepared for it,' Perry said, noting that he's learned from the mistakes of the past.

'The biggest error in judgment I made [in 2011] was thinking that just because I’d been the governor in the state of Texas I was prepared to run for the presidency of the United States,' Perry told the post. 'It is very different in the sense of having a global grasp of what’s going on in the world.'

Another name making a comeback in politics is Mitt Romney.

Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, has said he does not plan to run again, but he could yet change his mind. Romney adamantly claimed in 2008 he wouldn't subject himself to another presidential campaign and ran again anyway.

A recent 
poll of voters in First-in-the-Nation state New Hampshire found that 
Romney would blow his potential competitors out of the water if he did seek an encore.

Bachmann was not included in that poll, having just signaled this week that she's debating another run, but Perry and Santorum were, and both men barely registered on the poll, garnering one and two percent of the vote, respectively, in the hypothetical match-up.

Mitt Romney emerged as the dominant force 
in New Hampshire GOP politics last week, blowing away the competition in a 
hypothetical 2016 presidential primary matchup

None of the former 2012 candidates looking for a second chance - or third, if Romney really does explore another campaign - have anything to lose.

Neither Romney nor Santorum currently hold elected 
offices, and Bachmman is not running for another term in Congress. After
 January, she'll be free to join Santorum and Perry on the unofficial campaign 
trail in early primary states.

Likewise, 
Perry has opted not to run for a fourth full term as Governor of Texas, 
having already held the office for more than a decade.

Even if none of the other 2012 contenders ran again, Bachmann would likely face a tough, and crowded, field of fellow candidates.

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, House Budget Committee Chairman and 2012 Vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan of Wisconsin are all said to be considering campaigns.

That's in addition to Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky.

Bachmann told Real Clear Politics that if she did try again, her previous experience as a presidential candidate would 'certainly' be to her advantage.

'I haven’t made a decision one way or another if I’m going to run again,
 but I think the organization is probably the key,' she said.

'To have 
an organization and people who surround you who are loyal, who are 
highly competent, who know how to be able to run the ball down the field
 in state after state -- because now I think the primary process will be
 very different this time. It will tighten up; it will be a much shorter
 run than it was before.'

Recent elections do show that Republican candidates who have prior experience as a presidential candidate do have a better chance at winning the nomination the second time around, and Bachmann was an early favorite in Iowa last time.

Arizona Sen. John McCain was selected as Republicans' 2008 nominee after losing out the first time to Texas Governor George W. Bush. Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney won the 2012 nomination getting beat out for the honor in 2012 by McCain.

If tradition holds true, the Republican nominee will be Bachmann, Perry or Santorum, assuming any or all of them run.

'Like with anything else, practice makes 
perfect,' Bachmann said. 'And I think if a person has 
gone through the process -- for instance, I had gone through 15 
presidential debates -- it’s easy to see a person’s improvement going 
through that.'
