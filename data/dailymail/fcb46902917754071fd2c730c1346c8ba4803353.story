Angel di Maria's first Manchester United goal on his home debut may have looked fortunate, but the Argentine has claimed it was deliberate.

Di Maria's free-kick from 35 yards out was the opening goal in United's 4-0 Premier League win over QPR.

The Argentine's strike looked like a cross as he whipped a ball into the box, before it evaded everyone on its way to bouncing and settling into the top corner.

But the £63million summer arrival from Real Madrid has denied he was intending to pick out a team-mate, insisting the goal came straight from the club's training ground.

Through the interpretation of fellow Spanish speaker Juan Mata, the Argentine revealed his delight at scoring his first goal for Manchester United after being named the Man of the Match.

'I'm very happy to score my first goal at home,' Di Maria told Sky Sports. 'We've been practicing it in training all week and I done it then, so it's no surprise for me.'

Following goals from Ander Herrera and Rooney, Mata also got on the United score sheet and claimed United were a much better team following Louis van Gaal's first win as United boss.

'We played much better than the first games. From beginning to the last minute we tried to score and with the players we have, we have to score lots of goals and be compact in defence. Hopefully this is the first step in a good run of results.'
