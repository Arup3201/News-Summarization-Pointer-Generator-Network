A heroic father died a tragic death over the weekend when he was killed by an oncoming train as he desperately tried to save the life of his son.

Bradley Barngrover, 32, of Fairland, Indiana, was driving with his son when his car stalled on some tracks just moments before a train came through.

Barngrover died from his injuries later that day at Indiana University Health Morgan Hospital. 

His nine-year-old son Jaden survived, and was treated for pain.  

Tragic end: Bradley Barngrover (above, with wife Krissy and their three children) died after his car stalled on some train tracks over the weekend

According to The Reporter-Times, Barngrover was on his way to purchase the 'new truck of his dreams' at the time of his death.

The train hit the car after father and son had exited according to eyewitnesses, but  the force of the train hitting the back of Barngrover's truck caused the vehicle to smash into him.

This after the father struggled to free his son from the car.

In addition to Jaden, he leaves behind two young daughters, Amaya and Eva, and his wife, Krissy Barngrover.

Barngrover worked for a local construction company and was preparing to graduate from Ivy Tech Community College with a degree in automotive technology.

A page has been set up for donations to help his family pay for the funeral.

Newlyweds: Though they had dated for 12 years, Barngrover and his wife Krissy (above) married just last year

'I am so thankful for all the people that have been so supportive to me and my children throughout this,' his wife wrote on the page.

'I still keep hoping to wake up and have my sweet husband laying next to me like he was supposed to for the rest of my life. Thank you to everyone for the support, thoughts, and prayers. I know Brad appreciates it as well. He was and always will be mine and my children's hero.'

The two, who had dated for over 12 years, were married just last October.
