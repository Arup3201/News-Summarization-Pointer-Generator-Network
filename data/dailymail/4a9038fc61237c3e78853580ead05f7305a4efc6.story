A mother who lost her three daughters and elderly parents in a Christmas Day fire at her Connecticut mansion has revealed how she is slowly piecing her life back together - and is even engaged.

Nearly two years since her unimaginable loss, Madonna Badger has written a piece for Vogue about how suicidal thoughts and a dark depression gave way to feelings of hope and understanding thanks to friends who took her in and life-changing charity work at an orphanage in Thailand.

She has now returned to work in New York City and is looking forward to getting married next year to a long-time friend, who appeared by her hospital bed the day of the tragedy in 2011.

'It's never going to be easy,' she said of her loss. 'The pain 
is just so huge that sometimes it feels like a prison cell. But trying 
really hard to not feel sorry for myself makes me feel good.'

Fighter: Madonna Badger, who lost her three daughters and parents to a Connecticut house fire on Christmas Day, 2011, beams with happiness as she is pictured with her fiance, William Duke

At first, Badger, 49, could never have imagined feeling such peace.

She recounted the joy-filled Christmas Eve in 2011 with her daughters, nine-year-old Lily and seven-year-old twins, Sarah and Grace, and her parents, Pauline and Lomer Johnson. They were joined by her boyfriend of a month, Michael Borcina, who was the contractor on the Stamford home.

But that night, unfathomable tragedy struck. She woke at 3am to a room filled with smoke and although she desperately tried to save her daughters, only she and Borcina survived.

Authorities have said the home caught fire due to still-glowing fireplace embers that had been put in a mud room. Badger has expressed skepticism over this conclusion, insisting that she saw electrical sparks coming from the house as she clambered over scaffolding to reach her girls.

Missed: Madonna's parents, Lomer and Pauline Johnson, also lost their lives in the early-morning fire

She still replays the surreal evening over and over in her head, she wrote in Vogue.

'Even
today, I wake up most morning and I'm back there trying to figure out 
how to save everybody, or thinking about what I could have done 
differently,' she said.

'Why
didn't I climb into bed with my kids? Why didn't I check on them in the
night? Why didn't I smell the smoke? Why did I choose that house?'

After
learning in hospital that her daughters and parents had all died in the
fire, the next thing she remembers is waking up surrounded by friends, 
including now-fiance William Duke.

Just
days later, she managed to attend the funeral of her children, sobbing 
alongside her ex-husband and the father of her girls, Matthew Badger.

But
just two days afterwards, with no funeral to organize or focus on, she 
plunged into a deep depression and broke down, threatening to take a 
bottle of pills, she recalled.

Survivors: Only Badger and her boyfriend of a month, contractor Michael Borcina, survived the fire. They are pictured at the children's funeral but Badger said their relationship had no hope

Devastated: Madonna cries on the shoulder of her ex-husband, Matthew Badger, at the funeral

She was committed to a psychiatric 
hospital in New York and was not allowed to check herself out. There, 
her story made therapists cry and she watched as patients went for electric shock therapy.

Eventually
she was moved to a trauma-therapy center outside Nashville 'by which 
time my hair was coming out in clumps,' she said. 'I don't remember 
eating. At times I was manic; at other times, almost catatonically 
depressed.'

Desperate to 
escape, in February 2013 she called her old college roommate, Kate Askew, in Little Rock,
Arkansas and asked to stay with her. Kate and her husband agreed - as 
long as she promised not to kill herself. Badger promised.

'I
was lying through my teeth,' she said. 'At that point I was far closer 
to killing myself than I was at any other point during the tragedy - I 
felt sure it was my only option.'

But
with her move to Arkansas, bit by bit, she began to feel some normalcy.
She began daily therapy sessions, took up yoga and had acupuncture 
treatments.

She also began helping out a friend of 
Kate's with her estate sales business, sorting through antiques and old 
family belongings.

Carrying on: Madonna said she feels the children's memories would best be honored by continuing to live

She credits the work with saving her life - not only because it focused her energies, but also because looking at old photos of people who had long since passed helped her face the idea of loss.

'Little by little, I was getting my brain back online,' she said.

Realizing that she was craving the type of work more suited to her - working for advertizing firm Jim Winters in New York - she decided to move back. But before that, she had to face Christmas again.

She decided to go to an orphanage in Thailand and on Christmas Day, she gave the children toys that had previously belonged to her own daughters.

'I closed my eyes and when I opened 
them we were all crying,' she said. 'When I looked into the girls' 
faces, I saw my children. It broke me open in a way I still can't fully 
explain.

'But
if these little girls were living their lives with joy and happiness, I
realized - and if they could give their love to me after all they had 
been through - how could I possibly feel sorry for myself?'

She returned to work in New York and said the job had given her a 'deep comfort'.

Staying strong: She has returned to work in New York City and plans to get married next September

On moving back to the city, she contacted Bill Duke, who lives and works as a real estate broker in Brooklyn, for help finding a new place to live.

They had initially met years ago at Duke's grandparents' house in the East Hamptons when Badger briefly dated one of his brothers.

Duke asked her out on a date - and now the couple are engaged. They are planning to wed next September and this Christmas, they will volunteer together, she said.

She added of her loss: 'You can either be full of hate or full 
of love - it can go either way. I have no hate in my heart, no 
bitterness, and I am blessed by this.

'What better way to honor their lives than to not give
up?'

The article by Madonna Badger features in the December issue of Vogue, which goes on sale on November 19.

Matthew Badger set up the Lily Sarah Grace Fund in the girls' memories. For more information, visit the website here.
