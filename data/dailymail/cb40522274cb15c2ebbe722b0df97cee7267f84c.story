A scandal-hit NHS trust where up to 16 babies died because of poor care has apologised after it emerged management sent an 'insulting' email about an inquest into a child's death.

Liza and Simon Brady lost their son, Alex Davey-Brady, in September 2008 asphyxiated at birth amid claims that midwives at Furness General Hospital delayed his delivery

The couple secured the release of a dossier of emails referring to the couple and the inquest into Alex's death.

Tragedy: Liza and Simon Brady lost their son, Alex Davey-Brady, in September 2008 amid claims that midwives at Furness General Hospital delayed his delivery

Controversial: The hospital has apologised to the family of baby Alex, after an internal email brought the 'bad news' of his inquest

It suggests that staff at the Barrow in Furness hospital 'briefed' witnesses ahead of inquests and were concerned about bad publicity.

In one memo dating back to June 18 2009, Ranu Rowan, head of legal services, said: 'I am sorry to be the bearer of bad news but I have this morning received a letter from the coroner informing me that the Davey-Brady inquest has been listed on July 2.

'This means we now have four inquests in Barrow next month which have a potential for adverse publicity (and I have a further 10 witnesses to brief in addition to the 10 I already had).'

The email was sent to disgraced former chief executive Tony Halsall, medical director Peter Dyer and chief of nursing Jackie Holt.

Mrs Brady said: 'Why do they need to be the 'bearer of bad news'?

'The way they write things it's like you are a number rather than an actual person or a family.

'They say 'the bearer of bad news', but to me the inquest is an opportunity to learn.

'I always knew they were very closed - but to have it in black and white is a different feeling.

'It has left my angry and asking how can we take confidence that things are being put right.'

Inquiry: A probe has been launched after as many as 16 babies died in a decade within the trust running Furness General Hospital in Cumbria

The trust has a history of staff abusing grieving parents.

Last year it emerged staff at the trust had made a number of cruel jibes about James Titcombe, whose son Joshua died. The trust later apologised for any distress caused by the remarks.

Mr Titcombe was also subject to cruel emails on a previous occasions from midwives he had reported to the Nirsing and Midwifery Council.

In a statement John Cowdall, chairman of the University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'The email released to Mrs Brady under the Data Protection Act was sent in 2009 from the head of legal services to the former chief executive, medical director and director of nursing to make them aware of an upcoming inquest.

'The member of staff was highlighting the number of upcoming inquests in a short period of time, and the potential impact these could have on public and staff confidence in the trust.

Prabas Misra, an obstetrician and gynaecologist at the hospital, wrote a damning letter to bosses after Alex's death alleging midwives appeared to be rejecting doctors' advice.

Mr Cowdall added: 'We take each inquest very seriously and are truly sorry that the email has subsequently upset Mrs Brady and her family.

'When it was sent in 2009, the email was meant as an internal communication to ensure that senior board members were aware of the situation and the possible effect on staff and public confidence. We do not believe it was meant to belittle the importance of the inquest.'
