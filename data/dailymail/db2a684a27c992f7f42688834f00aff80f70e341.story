Al-Shabaab has released a graphic video calling for 'Westgate-style' attacks on shopping districts such as Oxford Street in London as well as major shopping centres in the United States and Canada. 

The threat is being taken seriously by security officials across the Atlantic after the group called on Jihadis living in the west to target major shopping centres in their home cities. 

During the 76-minute video, which was published on YouTube by Al-Shabaab's media wing, the terrorist, who has a strong English accent, recites a list of potential targets which included London's Oxford Street as well as the Westfield malls in Stratford and White City.

The terrorist , who has a strong English accent, gave GPS co-ordinates for two London shopping centres 

The unnamed terrorist specifically names Oxford Street in London as one of the potential targets  

He also threatened the Mall of America in Minnesota, which is the largest shopping centre in the U.S. 

Donning a camouflage jacket with a headscarf covering his face, the fighter threatens action and refers to the  group's 2013 siege on Kenya's Westgate Mall, in which 62 people died.

The terrorist even supplied the GPS co-ordinates for the Westfield shopping centres in Stratford, East London and White City in West London.

The video, which lasts 76 minutes, is fronted by a terrorist with an English accent. 

He said: ‘We call upon our Muslim brothers, particularly those in the West, to answer the call of Allah and target disbelievers wherever they are.

‘If just a handful of mujahedeen fighters can bring Kenya to a complete standstill for nearly a week, imagine what a dedicate mujahed in the West could do to American or Jewish owned shopping centres across the world?

‘What if such an attack on the Mall of America in Minnesota or the West Edmonton mall in Canada or in London’s Oxford Street. Or any of the hundred or so of the Jewish owned Westfield shopping centres.

‘Take the Westfield shopping centre in Stratford or White City for example, what would be the implications of such an attack, one can only imagine.

‘All it takes is a man with firm determination, of which our Muslim ummah (community) has plenty of.’

Finishing his slowly delivered and lengthy speech, he said: ‘So hurry up and hasten to Heaven and do not hesitate.

The Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, is specifically targeted. Chillingly, an image of the centre is shown in the corner of the frame, while its GPS co-ordinates are displayed in a white font.

Speaking directly to the camera, the unnamed militant says: 'If just a handful of mujahideen fighters could bring Kenya to a complete stand-still for nearly a week, just imagine what the dedicated mujahideen could do in the West to American or Jewish shopping centers across the world.'

He adds: 'What if such an attack were to occur in the Mall of America in Minnesota? Or the West Edmonton Mall in Canada? Or in London's Oxford Street?'. 

Now, the Mall of America is taking 'extra security precautions' in light of the threat. Officials are reportedly working closely with the FBI and America's Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Some of the new security measures will be visible to shoppers, while others will not, a security official told CBS News, adding that employees 'will remain diligent as they would do in any similar situation.'

Speaking to Fox News, Jim Kallstrom, the former assistant director of the FBI’s New York office, said the bureau has a 'huge job' in front of them in the wake of the threatening online video.

The terrorist specifically mentioned the 2013 attack on Kenya's Westgate Mall, killing more than 60 people

'You look at the Mall of America, you look at all the malls, then you start to backtrack and say it would be nice if we knew what comes and goes into the country,' he said. 'We don’t have a clue.' 

On Sunday, US homeland security chief Jeh Johnson urged shoppers to be on their guard while visiting the Mall of America - the country's largest shopping center, with 40million visitors a year.

'I would say that if anyone is planning to go to the Mall of America today, they've got to be particularly careful,' Mr Johnson said during an appearance on CNN's 'State of the Union.' 

'This latest statement from al-Shebaab reflects the new phase we've evolved to in the global terrorist threat in that you have groups such as al-Shebaab, ISIL [ie. the Islamic State, or ISIS], publicly calling for independent actors in their home lands to carry out attacks.

'We're beyond the phase now where these groups would send foreign operatives into countries after being trained someplace.'

More than 60 people died and 200 were injured following the 2013 terror attack claimed by Al-Shabaab 

He added that he was 'very concerned' about the potential threat 'lone wolf terrorists' pose to shopping centres across the West. 'Any time they call for an attack against a specific place, we've got to take that seriously,' he said.

Another DHS official later clarified that Mr Johnson's did not mean shoppers should avoid  the Mall of America - only that they should be 'extra vigilant' and should be aware that security is increased.

Shortly after the Westgate Mall incident in September 2013, al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack and estimated 67 deaths. Around 200 people were also injured in the days-long assault.

In the newly-released video, al-Shabaab runs a documentary-style account of the deadly attack, complete with images of terrified men, women and children running for their lives through the mall.

The masked militant then appears on-screen and suggests similar attacks could be carried out on the Mall of America, the West Edmonton Mall in Canada, or London's popular Oxford Street.

The footage, apparently posted online by the Islamic group, also includes six minutes of graphic images of terrorist activity and discusses Kenyan forces' intervention in Somalia, it is reported.

Minnesota, where the Mall of America is based, is home to a sizeable Somali population. U.S. law officials have been concerned about the potential for radicalization among some of the community.

Last week, a Minnesota man was charged with conspiring to support ISIS - which has taken over swathes of Iraq and Syria - and lying to federal agents investigating recruitment by militant groups.

Prosecutors said dozens of people from the Minneapolis-St. Paul area - many, Somali-Americans - have traveled or attempted to travel overseas to support ISIS or al-Shabaab since 2007.  

Scotland Yard said: ‘The Met Counter Terrorism Command is aware of the video and is assessing the content.

‘We remind the public that downloading extremist material may constitute an offence.’
