Bonus: Virgin boss Richard Branson holds a model of a spacecraft at the launch of the ambitious space tourism project in 2004.

Plush departure lounges, free flights and priority boarding are just a few of the benefits already enjoyed by Virgin Airline's frequent fliers, but the latest perk being offered by billionaire boss Richard Branson is truly out of this world.

Virgin Airlines has announced that the customer that accumulates the most frequent flier points over the next year will be rewarded with a free trip to space.

Mr Branson's space tourism company Virgin Galactic is working on providing would-be astronauts with sub-orbital flights to just outside of the earth's atmosphere - with a price tag of $200,000.

Now frequent users of Virgin Airlines are being given the chance to upgrade to 'Galactic' status, with the customer who builds up the most points between now and August 7 2013 winning a free flight on board Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo.

The runner-up will be treated to a free zero-gravity flight aboard a modified aeroplane on earth.

Over 500 people have paid deposits to secure a place on a $200,000 trip aboard SpaceShipTwo.

Virgin Galactic - billed as the world's first commercial 'spaceline' - has carried out successful test flights using SpaceShipTwo, but it is yet to fly any tourists into space.

The refundable deposits to reserve a spot on board the spaceship start at $20,000.

The craft, which is designed to carry six passengers, is launched midair from another 'carrier' aeroplane.

The Federal Aviation Administration has given Virgin the green light to test SpaceShipTwo in 'powered flight' by the end of the year. It has already successfully completed 'gliding' tests.

Virgin isn't the only company working on sub-orbital flights. Space Adventures, based in Virginia, U.S., has been planning hour-long trips to 62 miles above the earth's surface at a price of just over $100,000.

Galactic perk: The Virgin Airlines customer who earns the most frequent flier points this year will be rewarded with a seat on board SpaceShipTwo, shown here in an artist's impression
