QPR have made a contract offer to free agent Rio Ferdinand, who was released by Manchester United at the end of last season.

The 35-year-old is keen on a move to London and Harry Redknapp is happy to give the veteran defender a one-year deal.

The Loftus Road club are prepared to pay close to £80,000 a week to secure the services of Ferdinand, who has also had offers from Aston Villa as well as clubs in Turkey and the USA.

Contract: QPR have offered Rio Ferdinand a deal worth £80,000 a week to join the club

Return: The 35-year-old defender is keen on moving back to London after leaving Manchester United

It would be a move back to the capital for the former England captain, who left West Ham for Leeds in an £18million transfer 14 years ago.

He then switched to Manchester United two years later for £30m and won six Premier League titles, the Champions League, the FA Cup and the League Cup twice.

QPR also want to sign Ashley Williams for £4m from Swansea City.

Sunderland have already bid for the 29-year-old centre back but Rangers will challenge for the Welshman's signature.

In demand: The veteran defender has also had offers from Aston Villa, as well as club in the US and Turkey

Target: QPR also want to sign centre back Ashley Williams from Swansea City for £4million
