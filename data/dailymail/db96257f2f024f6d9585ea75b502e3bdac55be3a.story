Support: Sir Ben Kingsley is behind London's theatreland on its stance over keeping its traditional lights

Actor Sir Ben Kingsley is backing a campaign to stop Brussels pulling the plug on Britain’s theatre lights.

The star of Gandhi, Iron Man and Schindler’s List has joined the fight to save playhouses from tough new EU measures requiring them to do away with old-style lighting and install ‘eco-friendly’ systems instead.

Sir Ben urged Brussels to rethink the crackdown amid fears it will ‘ruin’ the look of hit London shows such as Les Misérables and War Horse.

Critics also say the move will threaten the survival of struggling amateur theatre companies which would not be able to afford new lights.

The ‘Theatreland v Brussels’ row centres on the EU decision to phase out traditional tungsten incandescent light bulbs in favour of ‘greener’ LED units.

It is already illegal to import or manufacture the old-style bulbs, although people can use them while stocks last.

But campaigners say the new LED (light emitting diode) units are unsuitable for the stage.

Michael Hulls, a lighting designer and co-ordinator of the campaign, said: ‘Of course, we all agree with moves to save the environment.

'But telling people to use LED units to light theatre productions is like telling Leonardo da Vinci to swap his oil paints for felt-tip pens.

'LED lighting cannot yet replicate tungsten.

'You couldn’t have an LED bulb in a 
bedside lamp in a period production or in a chandelier in a 19th Century
play – it would just look totally wrong.’ 

Mr Hulls fears many amateur theatre companies could go to the wall. 

He said: ‘They can’t afford these changes. Replacing an existing fitting may cost you £20 compared to £2,000 for an LED.’ 

Former Tory Minister Peter Luff said: ‘A big mistake has been made that could have serious consequences for theatres.’

A spokesman for Sir Ben said yesterday he was ‘very happy’ to lend his backing to the campaigners, who include lighting directors behind box-office successes such as The Audience, starring Helen Mirren, Les Misérables and War Horse.

Last night, the European Commission insisted that theatres were free to continue to use tungsten lighting.

A spokesman said: ‘The regulation has specific provisions exempting the production and use of special lighting such as that used in theatres.’

However, campaigners say the exemption does not cover many of the lights needed for theatre productions.
