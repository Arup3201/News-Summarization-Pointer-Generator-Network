Claire Danes may have scooped the award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series category for her role in Homeland at this years 65th Primetime Emmys, but it was her hair that caused the biggest storm when she stepped onto the red carpet.

With her usually shoulder length locks seemingly chopped into a soft bob, the 34-year-old actress revealed to E! read carpet presenter Ryan Seacrest that her crop was in fact fake.

Rather than committing to a haircut, the actress had her hair carefully styled into a ‘fob’, or faux bob, and here Femail shows you how to copy this chic style.

Keep your hair on! Homeland's Claire Danes pulls hair fake-out with 'faux bob' when she hit the red carpet at the 65th Primetime Emmys on Monday

Celebrity hair dresser Errol Douglas MBE, who has worked with the likes of Diana Ross, Brad Pitt, Barbra Streisand, and supermodels Christy Turlington, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, shows us how.

Errol said of Claire’s red carpet look: ‘The bob is a classic – it's the fast track to elegant and a great way to show off high gloss healthy locks, it's age versatile and there's an interpretation that works for all face shapes and hair colours. 

‘It's an iconic look and will always work for the timeless glamour we like to see on the red carpet.  I love that Claire Danes rocked the fake.’

Errol says that the right tools and preparation are essential for Femail readers hoping to create the perfect ‘fob’

Where you are after a 'fob' or a full-on bob, Errol says make sure you get the right style for you.

'Ask what length overall and type of fringe or not will suit your face 
shape, age and lifestyle.

'A longer version with soft fringe will be 
easier to maintain and easier to wear. Do ask also about colour 
choices, particularly on blonde tones, as they need to match skin tones
which change with age, just to ensure they flatter and don't appear 
harsh.

'Ask about the amount of layers cut into a bob – too many results 
in a loss of shape and the hair kicks OUT instead of IN which is the 
signature look of a bob. 

'Finally, the the minimum length of a bob I 
feel for best flattering features should be to the jaw line, anything 
above is quite difficult to pull off and isn't for everyone'

He says: 'After a barrel brush blow dry to really smooth out all of the hair, use pins to literally mould the hair and push it underneath itself, rolled almost to the desired bob length. 

‘Faking on longer hair in this way creates a natural vintage movement with the thickness of the hair once it's doubled up on itself. Use Moroccanoil Hydrating Styling Cream to mould (use on wet hair before the blow dry) and Moroccanoil Luminous Hairspray to set without stiffness.'

'A smooth, healthy, high shine finish is the key to all interpretations of the bob, so product preparation and the right styling tools are essential. Build in moisture before a barrel brush blow dry with Morocanoil Original Treatment applied from mid length to ends.

'Once dry, finish with a heated styling tool that locks in moisture and delivers shine. My Treat&Style has built in Keratin Capsules to infuse a shot of the hair's naturally produced protein, visible on the finish. Use a non-sticky spray to finish that allows movement.'

The mother-of-one arrived as a nominee in the Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series category for her role in Homeland, but the star left as a winner.

She also stunned on the red carpet, wearing an Armani Privé couture lace gown with a neckline slashed down to the navel, paired with subtle Neil Lane jewellery and Christian Louboutin shoes.

However some critics thought the actress looked too skinny, drawing attention to her jutting collar bones and flat chest.

Claire may have faked hers, but there was no doubt that bobs were as on trend as pale pastel dresses on the red carpet this year.

Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery's bob was sleek and side-parted, while Giuliana Rancic added edge to her chic bob with a bias cut and Jane Krakowski softened hers with layers and a sweeping fringe.

Errol says: Michelle Dockery's smooth, glossy, side-parted version brought great class to her overall look.'

January Jones also opted for a short cut, though with a curled tousled look, which was also adopted by Julianne Hough and fellow Man Men star Christina Hendricks.
