From boarding without socks to downing a drink bare-chested, these images show some of the most disgusting airline passengers to have recently taken to the skies.

The photos, captured by outraged flyers from across the world, were posted on former flight attendant Shawn Kathleen's now-famous Passenger Shaming website.

They include a middle-aged man napping with his top off, a woman propping up her feet against a wall and another donning a pair of very revealing denim shorts.

No shame: The images include a middle-aged man napping with his top off while a woman reads next to him

Garish: In some images, only a small part of the accused flyer's body is on show - but it is enough to prompt their fellow flier into taking a snap. These include this image of a female passenger's garishly painted nails

Others feature a man boarding a plane barefoot, a passenger performing press-ups on the floor and a woman canoodling her partner while straddling him.

In some images, only a small part of the accused passenger's body is on show - but it is enough to prompt their fellow flier into taking a snap and posting it on the site.

These include a photo of a woman's long, blonde ponytail hanging over the back of a seat - captioned 'hair sitch' - and an image of a passenger's garishly painted nails.

Ms Kathleen, who uses a fake name, set up Passenger Shaming in January 2013 to highlight some of the less than desirable - and often, 'disrespectful' - habits of flyers.

Since hitting the headlines earlier this month, it has been inundated with photos from anonymous passengers and flight attendants, which are posted to Facebook and Instagram.

Images to have been previously uploaded include people changing children's nappies on tray tables, before remarkably leaving them on the floor or in the back seat pocket when they disembark.

They also include people resting their feet near other flyers' heads, clipping their finger and toenails, eating smelly food and leaving a wake of destruction behind them.

One of the most infamous photos may be of an unwrapped condom found under a seat.

'Sometimes things happen in a dark cabin that's attempted under a blanket,' Ms Kathleen told Yahoo! earlier this month, admitting that she would usually quickly put a stop to that sort of behavior when she was a flight attendant. 

Ms Kathleen, who is responsible for the page, worked as a flight attendant for seven years.
