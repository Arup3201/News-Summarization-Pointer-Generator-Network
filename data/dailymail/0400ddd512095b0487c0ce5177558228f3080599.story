She was little more than 24 hours away from death and, in hindsight, the normally bubbly personality of vivacious Charlotte Dawson was subdued.

Not that Channel Nine Mornings hosts Sonia Kruger and David Campbell could have imagined that it was the last time they would see their regular Mornings show guest alive.

'[Looking back] I thought she seemed a bit more subdued than normal,' Kruger told the MailOnline. 'Normally she would be entertaining everybody from the get go.'

Looking back, Mornings co-host Sonia Kruger realised Dawson (pictured above, on her last ever TV appearance) was 'a bit more subdued than normal'

David Campbell and Sonia Kruger say Dawson sat back during her final appearance on TV, from her usually more forthright, funny and 'brutally honest' persona

'She was kind of sitting back and letting the other guys take the lead. I just thought she seemed a little quieter than normal.'

Dawson arrived at the Nine Network studios between 7.30 and 8am last Friday for hair and make-up, ahead of her appearance on a Mornings segment to discuss the tenth anniversary of the hit television show, Sex and the City.

By 9.10am, Dawson was sitting in the studio waiting for the segment to go ahead. The ensuing performance by the seasoned on-air performer would later have Kruger and Campbell - in their grief the next day after learning of her fate - in an intense discussion about Dawson's demeanour during her television appearance. 

What was to be Dawson's last ever interview, was ostensibly just a spot on Mornings, to which Dawson had been contracted for the last two years.

Dawson brightened up and engaged in the discussion about Sex and the City's message for women viewers, but she was a shadow of her usual self, Sonia Kruger believes

After Dawson's final appearance (above) on Channel Nine's Mornings show, hosts David Campbell and Sonia Kruger say her death has 'saddened' and 'blindsided' the network

Her humour still intact, Charlotte Dawson gave David Campbell one final ribbing in her usual 'affectionate' style

With decades of experience appearing on the network's fashion, sports, lifestyle and news programmes, Dawson was a popular member of Nine's 'television family'.

'She was always laughing and hanging around with Dickie [Channel Nine entertainment reporter, Richard Wilkins] in his room,' Campbell said.

He said Mornings' producers had regularly chosen Charlotte for her always entertaining, forthright opinions and her fearless 'jousting' with other guests, such as British TV reality contestant, Katie Hopkins, whose views on immigration has seen her labelled a racist.

'[Charlotte's] so great,' Campbell said. 'Her opinions are so valid. She's so funny. She had such experience. She would have a go. She was always having a go at me, in an affectionate, endearing way.

'That was one of her charms. There was nothing nasty about Charlotte. She was brutally honest, and that was one of the things that was so endearing about her. I enjoyed it.'

Dawson was to have one final 'go' at Campbell.

Before the segment, Dawson had posted on Instagram a photo of herself, joking 'About to go on @mornings9 to talk sex. As you can see I'm racking my brains and have gone blank'.

Overwhelmed: Nine's Mondays show hosts Sonia Kruger and David Campbell paid tribute to Charlotte Dawson, having friend Alex Perry (pictured, above, with Dawson) on Monday's show, but found it overwhelming that Dawson had been in the studio last Friday and 'now would never be there again'

Seated on the Mornings couch with Gretel Killeen, to debate whether  Sex and the City had empowered or damaged women, Dawson seemed relaxed and soon displayed her trademark energy.

It was only to Kruger, and only, later, on reflection to Campbell, that there was any a sense of something being awry with her.

A lively discuss ensued, during which Campbell remarked, 'it's just a TV show', to which Dawson, pointing at him, said, 'you loved it more than anyone'.

'Then she left,' Campbell said. 'I don't remember it being anything you could read something into. It was a simple 'see you guys later'.'

The next morning Sonia Kruger was in the Eastern Suburbs going about 'a normal Saturday' when the Mornings executive producer called her. It was minutes before the story would break in the media.

In Adelaide, David Campbell was backstage at Westfield preparing to take part in a pantomime, when someone told him the news.

'It was such a shock. It took the wind out of my sails, but I had to go on.'

When both presenters arrived at the Nine Network on Monday morning, Campbell said 'a sad vibe lay across the whole network'.

'It's pretty raw. We were all aware of her depression. She would talk about it, use it as a punchline.

We thought she might have been a bit quieter than usual, but you don't see anything like that coming.

'It really blindsided everybody.'

With help from their producers, Kruger and Campbell prepared a Mornings tribute for 'funny, warm, maternal' Dawson, consummate TV professional and 'caring friend'.

'We report on a lot of stories,' Campbell said, 'but it was one of the hardest things. I just found it confronting, almost overwhelming, that last Friday she was here and she will never be again.'
