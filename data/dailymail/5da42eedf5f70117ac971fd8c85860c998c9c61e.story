A mother seeking clearance to work with children and young people has been caught lying about her daughter having cancer for a number of years.

The cruel hoax was exposed by the Queensland's Civil and Administrative Tribunal after the Gold Coast mother, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, applied to the state government for a blue card to work as a child protection officer.

In a recent decision the tribunal denied the mothers request, citing a number concerns including a violent history between her ex-partner, an assault on her mother in law and reports her children and step children had suffered injuries under her care.

A cruel hoax by a Gold Coast mother has been exposed by the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal (QCAT). The woman, who applied to the state government for a blue card to work with children and young people was caught out, lying about her daughter having cancer for several years when she didn't and access Camp Quality services

Also cause for concern was the mother's decision to tell one of her daughters that she had cancer in 1998 following laser surgery to her foot. 

The tribunal reported she received the results of her daughter’s biopsy that confirmed she did not have cancer but she did not inform her daughter and other family members.

The tribunal also learned she accessed camp quality services for her daughter and three of her children. 

QCAT member Joanne Browne found matters of concern had been raised by an interstate child protection authority relating to the woman's past. 

'The material received from Child Protection ACT disclosed information relating to the mothers six children who were subject to a child protection order in late 2005,' found Ms Brown.

In a recent decision the QCAT tribunal denied the a Gold Coast mother a request for a blue card, citing a number concerns including a violent history between her ex-partner, an assault on her mother in law and reports her children and step children had suffered injuries under her care. Also that she had lied about her daughter having cancer for several years

It was also reported that her children were exposed to acts of physical and verbal aggression in the home, including allegations of harm towards her step children.

The tribunal learned the woman's violent history included assaulting her mother in law, which she punched to the face causing her to be taken to hospital, of which she pleaded guilty.

There was also evidence before the Tribunal that the mother received treatment for her depression and that she has completed some parenting courses and counselling since her separation from her former partner.

Ms Browne said the decision to deny the woman a blue card related to her criminal history and her inconsistencies in giving evidence. 

'The Tribunal is satisfied having considered all of the evidence that this is an exceptional case in which it would not be in the best interests of children for the Tribunal on review to issue a positive notice.'

'The Tribunal must hold the interests of children as its paramount.'

National child protection week starts Sunday, the 7th of September.
