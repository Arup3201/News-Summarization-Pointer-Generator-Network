Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said trusts found to be manipulating figures must be 'held to account'

A criminal offence could be created to punish doctors and health chiefs who manipulate hospital statistics, it emerged last night.

Jeremy Hunt is expected to announce the measure as part of an effort to reform NHS management in the wake of the Mid Staffordshire scandal.

Last night the Health Secretary said: ‘This is about a transparent, honest and accountable NHS.

‘Patients and the public should be confident they can trust information about how hospitals are performing and a culture of honesty and accuracy will help those organisations drive up standard of care.

‘If NHS trusts are caught deliberately manipulating that information, whether waiting times or death rates, they need to be held to account.’

If approved, the move will mean trusts could be fined millions and managers jailed if they are found to have falsified data on waiting times or death rates.

Several hospitals have been accused of fixing high mortality rates by ‘misrecording’ causes of death. 

This makes it almost impossible for regulators to check up on hospitals with poor standards of treatment and for patients to make decisions on where they want to be treated.

Nurses admit to being instructed to ‘massage’ waiting time figures by adjusting the recorded time that patients were signed in or discharged.

Up to 1,200 patients died as a result of poor care at hospitals in the Mid Staffordshire trust hospitals and ministers are expected to announce their measures to avoid a repeat of the scandal in ten days’ time. Ministers believe one of the key failings at Mid Staffs was a lack of transparency about where things were going wrong.

Sir David Nicholson ¿bears some responsibility¿ for the tragedy at Mid Staffordshire, the Health Secretary admitted for the first time this week

They have already announced that trusts will no longer be allowed to use gagging clauses to silence whistleblowers. It emerged earlier this month that the Royal Bolton Hospital may have misrecorded the deaths of up to 400 patients. The criminal sanctions will be put in place to ensure that hospitals publish reliable data without manipulating figures to hit targets.

Board members of NHS trusts and individual senior managers responsible for the data would be held criminally liable for seeking to manipulate information.

The Department of Health, health regulators or members of the public would be able to report managers and hospitals directly to the police if they had concerns about any statistics.

A source close to Mr Hunt said: ‘The manipulation of data has been happening, rarely, but consistently for many years. We feel strongly that if NHS trusts are caught acting fraudulently about their performance on areas such as death rates or waiting times, they should be criminally liable.’

More than a dozen hospitals are now being investigated over higher than expected death rates.

The Health Secretary said for the first time this week that Sir David Nicholson, who has been described as the Man With No Shame, 'bears some responsibility' as the manager of the Mid Staffordshire health authority during the scandal.
