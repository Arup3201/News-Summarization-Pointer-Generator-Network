A Bronx man was arrested after a motorist captured him hanging off the side of a speeding cab he tried to carjack early Monday morning.

Matthew McCorkle, 27, hung on for dear life as the cab careened up the Bruckner Expressway as fast as 70 mph just after 2.00 a.m. Monday, witness Vlane Carter told MailOnline.

McCorkle banged on the cab’s window while hanging on for dear life until jumping off and trying to steal another car, he was arrested a short time later, police sources said.

Just another Monday morning in the city: Matt McCorkle was seen by Vlane Carter hanging off the side of this cab on the Bruckner Expressway in the Bronx

Fast and furious: McCorkle is shown hanging on for dear life as the cab speeds up the Bruckner Expressway

The man’s terrifying ride through the Bronx almost cost him his life.

‘The man’s feet was dragging on the ground and he almost fell twice,’ said Carter. ‘The man would have been dead if he fell at that speed, especially after being run over by other cars.’

Carter called the taxi driver reckless, and said he sped up every time the man’s feet hit the ground.

McCorkle can be seen repeatedly banging and kicking the kick, begging it to stop, but the taxi driver sped on.

‘The taxi sped up to maybe 65, 70,’ Carter told WCBS. ‘I was, like, really getting nervous, because the guy was on the hood at this time, on the top of the car.

Lucky to be alive: The thief's feet hit the ground several times on his journey up the highway

Fearing for his life: The driver said he sped off because he didn't know if the suspect had a knife or gun - 'my safety first'

‘Then he was on the back, then he was trying to break the glass with his hand, and then the car was swerving. So it was like a Hollywood movie, almost.’

Driver Mohammed Millogo told WCBS the would-be carjacker frightened him.

‘This guy tried to get in my car. If he got in my car or he’s going to try to – I don’t know what he can have,’ said the driver. ‘He can have a weapon. He can have a knife. Anything can happen to me – my safety first.

‘Then I called the police and even I slowed down for him because I don’t want him to get hurt.’

Carter also called the police, but McCorkle jumped off the cab when it hit traffic.

The thief stole another car after pulling the driver out but crashed while trying to make a getaway, police said.

Cruising: McCorkle was somehow not injured during the death-defying ride, but he was eventually arrested

Authorities arrested him shortly after. He has been charged with driving while intoxicated, robbery and grand larceny.

McCorkle is no stranger to the NYPD. Just last month he was charged with menacing and harassing a woman. He has been accused of a litany of other crimes in his criminal career including criminal possession of a stolen weapon and multiple drug charges, records showed.

The criminal luckily suffered no injuries, but is being held without bail while undergoing a psychiatric evaluation.
