Van Gaal: Winning FA Cup is the priority 

Sometimes it isn’t easy to understand Louis van Gaal, and we’re not just talking about those occasions when he compares FA Cup ties to ‘death or the gladiolus’ or complains about back-fours ‘twitching my ass’.

The temptation has been to not question a man with his wealth of football experience who has coached some of the best teams and best players in the world. After all, Louis knows best.

But there have been times in his first seven months at Old Trafford when Van Gaal has left us scratching our heads; times when it all seems to be coming together, when formations are starting to make sense and players are building momentum, when he will appear to rip it up and start again.

Adnan Januzaj was perhaps unlucky not to be selected on Tuesday after starting to show his promise

So it was that we arrived at Old Trafford on Tuesday night to find that United had made five changes for the FA Cup fourth round replay against Cambridge United that brought a predictable home win.

Nothing strange in that, you might say. Van Gaal is desperate to win this competition and it probably made sense to freshen things up after Saturday’s win over Leicester City here, although it was surprising to see Adnan Januzaj left out altogether after the teenager had begun to show some of his old promise.

One look at Van Gaal’s teamsheet immediately raised questions about how United would line up, however. With the exception of Juan Mata, it was as if the manager had picked all his tallest players to counter the aerial threat from their League Two opponents. No pun intended, but surely Manchester United should be bigger than that?

While fine in theory, the 4-1-4-1 formation had Wayne Rooney operating on the right and Marouane Fellaini on the left. Then the big Belgian began to drift forward as the first half wore and ended up almost as a target man, knocking the ball down for Mata’s opening goal. It was as if United were trying to beat Cambridge at their own game.

It worked, and Van Gaal would be justified in saying that he picked a team to do a job. But BBC pundit Steve Claridge was not the only one to be a little perplexed. 

‘What an odd, odd system from Van Gaal,’ he said. ‘What an odd way to put out a team with the players you’ve got. Fellaini on the left wing and Rooney on the right? Really? Does that fit?

‘Why is he even out there, Rooney? Sir Alex used to play him there, but only when they were up against the likes of Bayern Munich and Real Madrid. If I was a player playing for United I would be absolutely deflated. If I was Rooney playing out wide against Cambridge, I would wonder what on earth the manager was doing with me. What am I doing out here? It’s just crazy.’

Jamie Carragher saw it a little differently. ‘The positions of Fellaini and Rooney are interesting tonight, not the usual positions you'd expect to see them in,’ said the Sportsmail expert. ‘Rooney wide right in possession but then tucking in when defending, and Fellaini playing up front to the left of Van Persie where he played at times under David Moyes at Everton.

‘Moyes never did that at United with Fellaini as he maybe felt he’d be criticised even though at times I think he should of but, LVG doesn’t seem to worry about other opinions and does what he thinks is right – so he should considering his cv!’

David Moyes may have been tempted to use Fellaini from the left, but he might have felt he'd be criticised

Van Gaal won't care what pundits like Jamie Carragher and Steve Claridge think

Too true. Van Gaal won’t give a fig what the likes of Claridge and Carragher think. From the moment he walked into Old Trafford, the Dutchman has been determined to do things his way. Sometimes it makes sense, sometimes not.

His devotion to a three-man defence, for instance, has been puzzling. The players are clearly uncomfortable with it and that invites pressure from opponents. Van Gaal has spoken about ‘coaching the players minds’ so they can adapt to different situations, but the English aren’t Dutch and Total Football is not something that can be learned overnight.

The fans have voiced their opposition to a system that is so foreign to United’s 4-4-2 ethos, and Gary Neville is not alone in pointing out that it curbs the team’s attacking verve.

Ander Herrera has been on the bench since netting a stunning goal for United against Yeovil Town

Then there is Van Gaal’s treatment of certain players. He is not one to care for reputations but the way he has handled Radamel Falcao has brought public criticism from the striker’s agent Jorge Mendes, long considered to be a friend of the club. Ander Herrera’s reward for breaking the deadlock at Yeovil in the third round with a cracking goal was to be left out of the starting line-up for the last five games. Januzaj is the latest to find out that a good performance is no guarantee of a place in the team.

Ultimately, Van Gaal is experienced enough to know that he will be judged on results. If he delivers a Champions League place and, who knows, the FA Cup this season then no-one is going to quibble about how he did it. United beat Cambridge comfortably and will fancy their chances of doing the same to Preston North End in the fifth round.

For now, it’s the gladiolus not death. Whatever that means.
