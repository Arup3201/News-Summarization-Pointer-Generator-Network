A health magazine has named pub chain Wetherspoon the prime spot for the most important meal of the day.

The lower fat sausages and poppy-seed toast has been hailed the best Big Breakfast at the Men's Health magazine Restaurant Awards 2014.

The chain beat a long list of other restaurants and food providers to be crowned the winners.

Pub chain Wetherspoon's breakfast was named the best at the Men's Health Restaurant Awards. Judges noted the lower fat sausages and poppy seed bread

In second place, coffee chain Starbucks was highly commended by experts and nutritionists.

Judges were impressed by the £3.09 Wetherspoon offering, noting the choice of lower salt and lower fat sausages, and bread with more fibre and less sugar than the average loaf.

Emma Gregory, food development manager for Wetherspoon, told The Daily Express they use award-winning Lincolnshire sausages, 100 per cent Danish back bacon and bread made to a bespoke recipe which includes poppy seeds.

Men’s Health editor Toby Wiseman 
said: 'The best-laid healthy eating plans can be sabotaged by bad 
decisions when eating out, but Britain’s most popular restaurant chains 
actually offer a wealth of high-quality and tasty options.

'You don’t need to stick to lettuce leaves when you’re keeping off the pounds.'

Pizza Express was named the best place to go on a date, with Prezzo highly commended.

The panel of expert judges made their decisions based on the quality of protein on offer, the fat content of the food, carbohydrate sources, salt, sugar, nutrient density and value for money.

Nando’s picked up the top award for best 'muscle building' food, followed by Japanese restaurant Wagamama.

And sandwich chain Subway won the award for offering lower calorie fast food.
