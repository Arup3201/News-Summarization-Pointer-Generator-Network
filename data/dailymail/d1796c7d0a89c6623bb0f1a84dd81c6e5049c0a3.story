It was a renovation project which would have tested even the most established of property developers to the limit.

But when Gwyn and Kate ap Harri set eyes on a crumbling and long abandoned 1920s cinema, they were determined to transform it into the stunning family home of their dreams.

And despite having no building experience, facing spiraling budgets, the stress of dealing with red tape and planning departments - not to mention bringing up two young sons - they have managed to breath new life into the impressive picture house in Thorne, South Yorkshire.

Ruins: The Old Kinsington Picture House had been abandoned and unloved for the past 20 years until the ap Harri family spotted it

Amazing transformation: The couple have managed to breath new life into the impressive picture house in Thorne, South Yorkshire

Rear: The couple had no building experience, and faced spiraling budgets along with the stress of dealing with red tape and planning departments

Food for thought: The couple's began in January 2011 when they spotted The Old Kensington Picture House not far from where they were living

The ap Harri's journey as they turned 
their derelict shell to new home will also feature in an episode of 
Channel 4's new series of Grand Designs. It began in January 2011 when they spotted The Old Kensington Picture House not far from where they were living. 

Writing
on their blog about the build, which chronicles the ups and downs 
encountered during the two and a half year project, Gwyn said: 'We’ve 
lived in and around Doncaster all our lives (give or take a few years at
Uni etc), and Thorne for the last 11 years.

Initially they hoped the site on which the decrepit 
cinema, and latterly an abandoned nightclub, might be the perfect spot to build a 
new house with a garden big enough for their two growing sons, Jac, 
eight, and Dylan, six.

But a brief conversation with the local 
planning department soon scuppered that idea. Authorities wanted the 
facade of the historic 90-year-old building preserved, but said the ap 
Harri's could have free rein over the rest of the building.

Looking out the back: They managed to buy the building for £90,000 and set themselves a budget of £350,000

Home cinema: They drew up plans for a striking building made out of a great deal of concrete - including concrete moulded in horizontal sections to resemble wooden boards

Final verdict: In July, the family moved into their home and will feature on Channel 4's latest series of Grand Designs in September

Gwyn, who runs a software company for 
schools, said: 'We have a nice home on Queen Street, but it’s got a tiny
garden, and our two lads are growing up fast.

'We
noticed that the old abandoned nightclub (as we knew it) was up for 
sale, and we enquired into the possibility of knocking it down and 
building a nice family home on the plot.'

He added: 'Yeah… we’ve said to lots of
people that the main reason we wanted to move from our existing house 
is that we wanted a bigger garden for our kids to run around in, and 
it’s absolutely true! To find ourselves doing what we’re doing is a 
consequence of that one thing.'

'We’ve
now moved in, and gradually finishing off the details. It was a bit 
like camping for the first few days, and then stressful when you’re 
trying to live normally while the builders are still in your house!

Outstanding conversion: Arched windows from the original facade of the cinema area a main feature in the wonderful bathroom in the South Yorkshire property

Light colours: The beautiful shower room is just one of the many renovated parts of the building, which will feature on Channel 4 next month

Transformed: The Old Picture House in Thorne, South Yorkshire has been totally renovated by the ap Harri family

'Anyway,
it’s sort of settling down now, but then we’ve got the final Grand 
Designs filming next week, so we’re scrambling to get everything 
finished.'

They managed to buy the building for £90,000 and set themselves a budget of £350,000.

'We
knew nothing about architecture, nothing about modernism, and Kate 
wanted something traditional. We had never done a building project 
before,' Gwyn told the Sunday Times.

After
engaging the services of old school friend and architect Jeremy 
Southgate, they drew up plans for a striking building made out of a 
great deal of concrete - including concrete moulded in horizontal 
sections to resemble wooden boards.

Sitting back: Friends and family sit back and enjoy the fruits of the ap Harri family's labour under a glass canopy door made by a company which normally fits out aircraft hangars

Room to grow: The ap Harri family bought the crumbling cinema because they wanted more space and a larger back garden for their two sons to grow up in

Sleek: The concrete clad interior and large windows allows light to flood the building which was designed to be sleek and minimal yet family friendly

Renovation: The ap Harri family bought the old cinema in Thorne, South Yorkshire for £90,000 and after spending £450,000 turned it into a stunning four bedroom home

Among the other outlandish features in the home was a large folding glass canopy door opening over the back garden, manufactured by a company that normally makes them for aircraft hangars.

But now, after two years of work, the brutalist inspired home has been completed - just £100,000 over budget.

In July, the family moved into their home and will feature on Channel 4's latest series of Grand Designs in September when presenter Kevin McCloud will give his verdict on the finished project.
