NBC News anchor Brian Williams made a hasty on-air apology Wednesday after Arsenio Hall mocked him for leaving Hall off a list of late night TV’s power players.

‘Arsenio is a late-night veteran and he took us to task on his show and he even urged his audience members to call our newsroom,’ Williams said on his ‘Nightly News’ telecast from the Winter Olympics in Sochi.

The apology came after some less than subtle urging from Hall. He not only encouraged his audience to call the NBC newsroom, but also brought on infamous rap mogul Suge Knight and cracked: ‘Sometimes I take a joke too far.’

Oops: NBC News host Brian Williams apologized from Sochi on Wednesday for leaving talk show veteran Arsenio Hall off a list of late night power players--all were white and many far less experienced than Hall

'Let me be in the middle where Alice used to be': Hall's irritation came from this Brady Bunch-like montage of late night hosts

Hours later, Williams made amends and poked fun at the networks other flubs.

‘So, in apologizing to Arsenio we just wanted to point out: At least you're in good company here,’ Williams said.

Williams noted that the newscast last year left New Hampshire off a map and on Tuesday misspelled Philadelphia on-screen.

Hall's exclusion came during what he called NBC News' ‘Brady Bunch montage’ showing photos of virtually every late-night TV host, including David Letterman, Chelsea Handler and Carson Daly.

Subtle urging: Hall's initial response included jokes about the all-white group in the NBC segment and he urged viewers to call the NBC newsroom

'We might just be kidding, Brian. You know, sometimes I take the joke too far. Just mention me, man,' Hall joked after infamous rap mogul Suge Knight came onstage making veiled threats

The photo graphic was used on Monday's ‘Nightly News’ segment on ‘The Tonight Show’ debut of Jimmy Fallon, also on NBC.

On Tuesday's syndicated ‘The Arsenio Hall Show,’ the host was smiling but clearly irked as he displayed the graphic and called out Williams and journalism in general.

‘If you're doing a story about late-night, all I ask is that you mention me,’ Hall said. ‘You don't even have to use a photo. I know how journalism is these days. Use Samuel Jackson — it doesn't even have to be my photo. Use Laurence Fishburne. Just mention me.’

Hall invoked the names of the two actors who were involved in another recent media mishap: A TV reporter interviewing Jackson apparently confused him with Fishburne. Both are black.

Late night vet: Arsenio Hall successfully aired a talk show against late night titan Johnny Carson and drew big name guests that famously included then president Bill Clinton

The late-night landscape is nearly all white, with a few exceptions including Hall and PBS' Tavis Smiley.

‘There's nobody even with a tan,’ Hall said of the montage shown by NBC News. ‘Hall, saying he's the only current late-night host ‘who competed and survived against Johnny

Carson,’ said he had no grudge with his other hosts. Hall's new show debuted in September; his original late-night show aired from 1989 until 1994, when Carson hosted ‘Tonight.’

Saying he didn't want to play the ‘angry black man,’ Hall invited a friend on stage to help out so that Williams and others in journalism would ‘include a brother.’

Marion ‘Suge’ Knight, founder of Death Row Records, suggested that Hall give Williams enough time to respond before making him face the consequences.

‘Change it or resign?’ Hall responded. ‘We might just be kidding, Brian. You know, sometimes I take the joke too far. Just mention me, man.’

Following Williams' apology, Hall offered a graceful acceptance.

'That was a cool way to do,' Hall on his show Wednesday. 'Thanks, Brian! I appreciate it.'
