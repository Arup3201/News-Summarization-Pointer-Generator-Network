The sister of balcony death victim Warriena Tagpuno Wright will make a public plea tomorrow for information which might solve the mystery of the 26-year-old's tragic death.

Reza Tagpuno will brave the glare of a media press conference at the Surfers Paradise Police Station on the central Gold Coast at 11am on Thursday.

Ms Tagpuno will be the first family member of the late Ms Wright's family to be seen since her sister's dramatic and fatal fall in the early hours of last Friday morning.

Nine News reported Ms Tagpuno, who flew into Queensland with Ms Wright's mother, Beth Wright, on Wednesday morning, will make her appeal in a bid for information and to gain their very private family answers and some closure.

Her family's arrival came three weeks after Ms Wright landed in Australia for a much-anticipated holiday for a friend's wedding.

Ms Wright's mother, Wellington church deacon Beth Wright, and her sister, Reza Tagpuno, flew into Brisbane and met with detectives from the task force investigating the young woman's death.

Dressed all in black, Beth Wright - who is a senior member of the Seventh Day Adventist Church in Porirua, New Zealand - kept her head bowed as she and Ms Tagpuno were accompanied through the airport.

They arrived two days after the completion of a post-mortem on Warriena Wright who plunged to her death from the 14th floor of the Avalon Apartments at Surfers Paradise on the Gold Coast in the early hours of last Friday morning.

Ms Wright fell to her death following an evening at the home of Gold Coast labourer Gable Tostee, who she had met on dating site Tinder.

She was in the final days of her Australian trip for a friend's wedding, before she was meant to be flying back to her native New Zealand.

Mr Tostee, who has declined to make a statement to police about the incident, has denied via social media any involvement in Ms Wright's death.

He has also hit back at reports police took footage away from his Gold Coast unit of his conquests.

But footage aired on Nine News reportedly shows Mr Tostee hosting a girl in an apartment.

On Wednesday, one scientific officer, a police photographer and a fire officer went up in the bucket of a cherry picker to collect fibres, human remains and DNA from the outside of the 14th and 13th floor balconies.

While forensic investigations unfolded, Ms Tagpuno gave a statement at the Gold Coast police headquarters about her sister.

On Tuesday, a visibly upset Ms Tagpuno said she was going through a hard time before leaving New Zealand and her sister was a 'very private person'.

Since the tragedy, it has emerged the man being investigated over the death of the female tourist had been banned from a number of nightclubs in the area for being 'creepy' and filming people - including women - on his mobile phone.

Gable Tostee, 28, is a regular on the Gold Coast's party strip and often visited nightclubs such as Crazy Horse, Cocktails, Club Liv, Bourbon Bar, Players, Alive, Vanity and Sin City.

In a long-running Facebook thread seen by Daily Mail Australia, nine Gold Coast women recounted their run-ins with Mr Tostee.

'Woah that's so f***ed,’ one woman replied to the news that Warriena Tagpuno Wright plunging to her death after meeting Mr Tostee.

Another replied: 'You would remember him hun, everyone in the [nightclub] industry does'.

She added she 'always’ thought there was ‘something not right about this guy'.

Another participant recalled: 'Honestly I've had so many run ins with this guy.'

Yet another said: 'Omg!! I remember this dude! He was sooooo weird. Him and his mate would go home and change their shirts half way through the night.'

'OMFG. I met this guy on Tinder four months ago,' wrote another participant woman, before detailing her an encounter with him.

Detectives revisit the balcony on Wednesday from which Warriena Tagpuno Wright fell to her death

Mr Tostee was barred from Vanity and Sin City after staff decided they did not like his behaviour.

‘He was just creepy,’ Sin City manager Ty Davidson said.

‘He was here all the time. Everyone along here knows him. Even after he was banned, he’d come on nights when the bouncer didn’t know him and try and get back in.’

A bouncer at one of the clubs along the strip told Daily Mail Australia Mr Tostee would obsessively film events with his phone and in one case a violent incident outside a club until he was told to leave.

He entered a ‘Mr Right’ male model search competition at Shooters three years ago and was banned from Vanity in 2012, and from Sin City some time after that.

The latest developments in the investigation into the death of New Zealand tourist Warriena Tagpuno Wright come as it was revealed he sent another young woman a 'creepy' message that 'insinuated violence' after they connected on dating app Tinder last year.

Tostee, 28, made contact with Stephanie Angus  on Tinder and sent her the alarming message 10 months ago.

'The first message was "Roses are red, violets are blue. I have a gun. Now get in my van" and I thought looking back it was quite creepy,' Ms Angus told A Current Affair.

'It was quite a scary thing for him to have written to me. It was quite a strange thing and it insinuated violence and that's quite a worry.'

Ms Angus said her best friend in Brisbane had also made contact with Mr Tostee on Tinder around the same time as her last year

Ms Angus said he has been back on Tinder in the days following Ms Wright's death.

Ms Angus, who works as a producer in Sydney for the Channel Nine program, said she stopped messaging Mr Tostee soon after.

'I found him to be a bit sleazy and he wasn't the type of bloke I was looking to meet. He was on there for one reason and I was on there for another reason,' she said.

Ms Wright, 26, died on Friday after she was last seen on the balcony of Mr Tostee's 14th floor home at the Avalon Apartment complex on the Gold Coast.

Mr Tostee has been in the spotlight since police started investigating Ms Wright's death. Witnesses claim to have heard loud screaming and raised voices coming from the 14th floor on Friday.

Ms Angus said her best friend in Brisbane had also made contact with Mr Tostee on Tinder around the same time as her last year.

'When we both realised it was him after seeing his photo, we were both extremely worried. It was quite a scary thing to read about,' she said.

'He came across as the sort of guy that's just out there to pick up girls.'

Ms Angus said he has been back on Tinder in the days following Ms Wright's death.

'He must have more things going on in his life, most important issues that checking who he's been matched with on a dating site,' she said.

Mr Tostee so far hasn't provided police with information about what happened when Ms Wright fell to her death, but Detective Superintendent Dave Hutchinson said they have obtained statements from 'a number of women'.

Police were at the 14th floor of the Avalon Apartments on the Gold Coast on Tuesday as part of their investigation

Detectives have also interviewed his parents Gray and Helene Tostee at their home in a gated community in Carrara, west of the Gold Coast tourist strip.

'He has exercised his right to silence, ' Mr Hutchinson told Daily Mail Australia.

Supt Hutchinson said a 'forensic procedure order' had been carried out against Tostee, which is believed to have included blood samples and a DNA swab.

Asked whether Mr Tostee was a person of interest in the case, Mr Hutchinson said: 'Obviously we are investigating the circumstances of the death of a young lady who fell from the balcony of his unit.

'He is going to be part of that investigation.'

His lawyer, Michael Purcell, said his client would not be making a statement to police in the foreseeable future.

But Mr Tostee took to a body building forum three times on Monday to talk about the investigation.

At 10.21am, he wrote on the forum: 'I've been advised not to go into details but all I will say is that I absolutely did NOT cause this girl to fall and that I am devastated about what happened to her.'

11.18am: 'Fact is I’ve taken home probably about 150 girls from clubs over the last few years. When you go out often to the same places and get drunk and talk to girls you’re bound to get noticed and hated on, and people gossip.

'Eventually it turns into Chinese whispers where people have a completely false impression of you.

'Most people who know me have been completely supportive, it's those who don't know me at all who assume the worst.'

Thirteen minutes later, at 11.31am, he added, 'My reputation has already been destroyed without me saying anything at all. It’s nothing I haven’t already posted in this thread, but that’s all I have to say for now.'
