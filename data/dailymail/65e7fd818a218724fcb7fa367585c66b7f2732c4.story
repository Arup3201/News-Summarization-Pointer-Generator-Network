A 16-week-old baby died from catastrophic head injuries after being attacked by one of her parents, a court heard today.

Paris Vince-Stephens was either shaken to death or suffered a blow to the head at the hands of one of her parents, William Stephens or Danah Vince, prosecutors allege.

The injuries were so severe that Paris died in hospital three days after collapsing at her home in the Brentry area of Bristol in January this year.

Four-month-old Paris died from head injuries after either being shaken or suffering a blow to the head

Bristol Crown Court was told that it was either Stephens, 25, or his 19-year-old girlfriend Vince who inflicted the fatal blow upon their baby daughter.

Stephens, of Southmead, Bristol and Vince, of Portishead, north Somerset, both deny charges of manslaughter and causing or allowing the death of a child.

Christopher Quinlan QC, prosecuting, told the jury of eight men and four women: '[Paris] had catastrophic and fatal head injuries.'

He said she was admitted to Bristol Children's Hospital on January 11, 2013, but died three days later as there was nothing more doctors could do for her.

Mr Quinlan told the court: 'The prosecution case is that one of these defendants, the mother or the father, caused those injuries by shaking her or by bringing her head into contact with a soft surface or a combination of both.'

Mr Quinlan told the court that the 
defendant who did not inflict the fatal injuries was culpable of causing
 or allowing the death of a child and failing to take steps to protect 
Paris. 

Mr Quinlan said that both defendants denied responsibility for killing Paris when interviewed by the police.

'Mr Stephens said he was not responsible and said he "didn’t touch her at all" that day,' the prosecutor said.

'When Danah Vince was questioned she denied responsibility. She said she had left Paris alone for a short period with Paris’s father William Stephens.

'She was fine, said Miss Vince, but much different when she returned. She, Danah Vince, didn’t shake Paris - it must have been William, she said.'

Mr Quinlan said the young parents had a 'volatile' relationship. They also used drugs, including cannabis, jurors were told.

He told the court that Stephens would be violent towards his girlfriend and she would be violent to him as well.

Vince told police that Stephens once assaulted her with a dog chain while she was pregnant.

He said social services stepped in and the couple signed agreements of no domestic violence.

But, even though Stephens was supposed
 to stay away from Vince, the court heard there was evidence he was 
still living with Vince at her flat.

Mr
 Quinlan said a student social worker then took on the case, before 
Stephens appeared before Bristol magistrates following a disturbance at 
the flat and was handed a restraining order to keep away.

Neighbours would often hear doors slamming, shouting and sobbing coming from their flat - sometimes being woken in the middle of the night by arguments.

The court also heard that both used drugs and according to Stephens' uncle, Andrew Wall, his nephew could be violent over drugs.

'He could get violent and snappy if he couldn't get hold of any,' Mr Quinlan said.

Vince's mother, Lisa Vince, said Stephens had punched and pushed her while under the influence of drugs.

Mr Wall also said Vince could also be violent when she wanted drugs.

The prosecutor told the court that on the day Paris was injured, the couple had a violent row over a missing £10 note.

Mr Quinlan said: 'He, William Stephens, grabbed [Vince] and pushed her onto the sofa and hit her in the face. She pushed him off and the dog bit him.'

Paris was taken to Bristol Royal Hospital for Children in January but died three days later

Later that morning Vince left Paris with Stephens while she went to an appointment at her doctor's surgery.

Mr Quinlan said that Vince went to get cannabis and toilet roll from a neighbour at around 4.15pm - leaving Paris with Stephens.

'Danah Vince told [the neighbour] that Paris was not well and making, as she described, really scary cries,' Mr Quinlan said.

A 12-year-old neighbour told police that he heard Stephens and Vince shouting at each other and swearing as he played on his games console after coming home from school that afternoon.

Paramedics were called at 4.40pm and suspected Paris had suffered a brain injury, the court was told.

Shortly after midnight on January 12, Vince sent a text message to her boyfriend's mother, Marie Stephens, which said: 'Tell Will to tell the police if they come he came to my flat for an hour. Ran over road for five minutes. Paris in cot and stayed in cot and nothing happened. Okay? Still in a bad way.'

Mr Quinlan asked: 'Are those the actions of an innocent mother beside herself with worry with a sick child?

'Or the actions of a person who knew what happened? Was it her that inflicted the injuries and was asking the Mr Stephens to tell the police nothing happened?'

Two hours later, Vince sent a text message to a friend, which said: 'She's really bad. I left her with Will for five minutes and now she's dying. I really can't cope. They did the test and that's what it said.'

When doctors told Vince that Paris had suffered 'irreversible and catastrophic brain injuries; she replied: 'I want him done for manslaughter.'

Mr Quinlan added: 'Asked if she had seen anything happen, she said no and added "My mistake was letting him in". A clear reference to William Stephens.'

Before Mr Quinlan began the prosecution’s case, trial judge Mr Justice Teare told the jury that Stephens would be assisted in the dock by an intermediary because he suffered from 'severe communication difficulties'.

The judge explained that because of Stephens’ difficulties there would be regular breaks in the proceedings.

The trial was adjourned until tomorrow.
