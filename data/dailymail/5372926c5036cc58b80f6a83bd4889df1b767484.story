A sinful combination of sugar, pasty and alcohol are flying off the shelves in the shape of 'drunken donuts' at one chain of bakeries.

Delightful Pastries, which has several locations dotted around Chicago, sells two flavors of the sweet treat - vodka custard and passion fruit liqueur.

The donuts cost three dollars each and are completely legal - as the alcohol evaporates during the cooking process, leaving only the flavors behind.

Scrumptious: The liqueur-laced donuts have become popular with the Chicago crowds

A baker at Delightful Pastries told MailOnline that the donuts were part of a Polish tradition called 'Fat Thursday' - a feast which happens before Lent - but were popular with customers all year round in Chicago.

The 'paczki', is a small donut with a creamy filling often of rose marmalade. The pastries have been part of Polish customs since the 17th century.

The donuts are made by deep-frying dough to make a traditional donut, then using a large piping bag to inject the pastry with an alcohol-laced cream filling.

The donut is then gently grilled, allowing the alcohol to evaporate but the flavor of the alcohol remains.

Delightful Pastries also creates a range of signature cakes including a raspberry chocolate mousse, mixed berry torte and German chocolate cake stuffed with pecan and coconut filling.
