The North Korean embassy in London lies silent today after apparently being emptied yesterday.

A removal truck was seen at its suburban Ealing embassy, sparking speculation that the ambassador and other diplomatic staff have fled as the communist nation's leader threatens war with South Korea and the U.S.

An official at the property denied that it was being evacuated at the time, saying that speculation of a withdrawal from Britain was 'ridiculous and not true'.

Silent: There was little sign of life at the North Korean embassy in London's Ealing today

A large container was reversed into the North Korean embassy in west 
London, leading speculation that the ambassador is being pulled 
out of the UK

Police held traffic so the container could be moved into position at the embassy in Ealing

But the man, who refused to give his 
name, would not explain why possessions were being removed from the 
building or say whether ambassador Hyon Hak Bong was relocating.

He said: 'I won't say anything about this. We have said everything we are going to say to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.'

The country's regime has a reputation 
for extreme secrecy, such as censoring its citizens and allowing only a 
small number of visitors through its borders, who are closely monitored 
during their stay.

Speculation that the country's ambassador was 
preparing to leave the UK was prompted earlier this week when a sign 
appeared on a tree outside the property warning that 'loading' would 
take place on Tuesday.

An individual at the property 
previously said that a secretary was leaving the UK having come to the 
end of his term and that a replacement secretary would arrive shortly 
afterwards.

The seven-bedroom property, which has 
been North Korea's embassy since 2003, is often a focal point for 
demonstrations against the oppressive regime. Built in the 1920s in a 
residential suburb, it is a far cry from the more luxurious 
ambassadorial properties of other nations in central London.

Boxes were seen being brought out of the house into the waiting lorry, that had been reversed up to the door to try to shield the action from waiting cameras

The move came on the day that North 
Korea sent more shivers through the international community by warning 
foreigners  living in South Korea to flee because the region was on the 
verge of nuclear war.

'The situation on the Korean Peninsula
is inching close to a thermonuclear war  … North Korea does not want to
see  foreigners in South Korea fall victim to the war,' the government
mouthpiece, KCNA news agency, said.

'All foreign institutions and 
enterprises and foreigners, including tourists, are requested to take 
measures for shelter and evacuation in advance for their safety.'

The latest threat came as North Korea's anxious neighbours beefed up their defences.

Getting out? A sign outside the North Korean embassy suggests the ambassador could be quitting London - as there will be 'loading' on Tuesday morning

Japan deployed Patriot missile 
batteries in the centre of Tokyo amid growing fears North
Korea may be preparing a new missile test.

The new threat appeared to be an 
attempt to scare foreigners into pressing their governments to get 
Washington and Seoul to act to avert a conflict.

Analysts see a direct 
attack on Seoul as extremely unlikely and there are no overt signs that
North Korea's 1.2 million-strong army is preparing for war – let alone a
nuclear one.

Few embassies in South Korea have 
advised their citizens to quit the country. The United States, which has
also been threatened by Pyongyang, says there are no imminent signs of 
threats to American citizens.

Analysts say Pyongyang's war rhetoric 
also has a domestic purpose – to bolster support for Kim Jong-un, 30, 
the third member of his family to lead  the country.

But UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon 
warned that soaring tension on the Korean Peninsula was 'very dangerous'
– and said 'any small incident caused by miscalculation or misjudgment'
might 'create an uncontrollable situation'.

The US military commander in the 
Pacific, Admiral Samuel Locklear, said North Korea's pursuit of nuclear
weapons and long-range ballistic missiles  represented a 'clear and 
direct threat' to the US and its allies in the region.

Admiral Locklear said the US military and its allies would be ready if North Korea tried to strike.

Japan's chief cabinet spokesman said the government is 'doing all we can to protect the safety of our nation'
