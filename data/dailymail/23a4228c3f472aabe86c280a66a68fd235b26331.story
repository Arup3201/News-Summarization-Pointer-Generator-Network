Click here for Chris Foy's look at the opening weekend of Europe's new club competition and his predictions ahead of the pool stage

As European rugby enters a new era with the Champions Cup set to kick off after a dark period behind the scenes for the code, Sportsmail rugby correspondent CHRIS FOY focuses on the stars of the show to pick out five potential standouts for this year's competition.

WILL FRASER  (Saracens)

An horrendous run of injuries have severely hindered Fraser’s progress, but at 24 he is still young enough to have a long international career. Very highly thought of by England’s management, Fraser (right) could yet put pressure on Chris Robshaw for the No 7 shirt.

Will Fraser is back near his best after a nightmare run of injuries and set to shine for Saracens in Europe 

JOE LAUNCHBURY (Wasps)

Hugely gifted English second row who some believe has the potential to emulate Martin Johnson in one of the toughest positions in the sport. 

Out of contract at the end of the season, the young lock is attracting attention from all quarters.

Second rower Joe Launchbury will be the highest of priorities for Wasps to keep now their new home is set

STEFFON ARMITAGE (Toulon)

Will he? Won’t he? The English qualified flanker was one of the players of the tournament last season as Toulon retained the European Cup. He is considering a move to Bath, but wherever he plays Armitage is likely to have a big impact.

Steffon Armitage's rumoured move back to England from Toulon appears to have fizzled, but he's a superstar

SEMESA ROKODUGUNI (Bath)

The former soldier has dodged bullets in Afghanistan, but has turned his attention to professional rugby union in recent years and is proving to be a huge success.

Rokoduguni  has sensational feet and pace and could yet make Stuart Lancaster’s World Cup squad.

The Fijian-born former Army star Semesa Rokoduguni has made his mark for Bath big time this season

ELI WALKER (Ospreys)

George North may be the most talked about Welsh winger, but young Eli Walker has a huge future ahead of him if he can stay fit. The speedster has pace to burn and a mesmerising side-step which make him a constant try-scoring threat.

Eli Walker may not be the household name of other Welsh wingers, but the Ospreys flyer is one to watch
