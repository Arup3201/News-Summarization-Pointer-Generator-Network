An elderly shopper has died after tumbling to the bottom of an escalator at House of Fraser during a family shopping trip.

The freak accident took place while the 87-year-old was on a day trip to Cardiff on Christmas Eve.

The incident is believed to have occurred when another shopper tripped near the top of the escalator at the department store, knocking into another woman who was stood below.

An 87-year-old shopper has died after tumbling to the bottom of an escalator at the House of Fraser department store in Cardiff, also known as Howells, on Christmas Eve

That woman then fell into the pensioner,  who was third in line on the moving stairway.

All three women - believed to be known to one another - fell down the escalator at the busy city centre store and were taken to hospital.

The pensioner died more than two weeks later from her injuries. 

Shopper Julian Rice, 48,  described how panic unfolded in the busy department store - known as Howells - but that everybody involved 'did everything possible'.

He said: 'Myself and my partner happened to be the first at the scene that day and it's bothered us all over the Christmas and New Year.

'There were three women together who were on a day trip from Manchester, the poor lady that died was very badly hurt.

'I did not know her but I have to say that everybody involved that day did everything possible.' 

The department store's first aider Rachel Dyer, who treated the injured shopper, added: 'I can safely say it was the worst day I've ever known. Something we will never forget. 

The pensioner was taken to University of Wales Hospital (pictured) along with two other women. She died more than two weeks later from her injures

'But I've never felt prouder to be a part of a team who pulled together to do everything we could. I just wish the ending had been different.'

After the incident, engineers were urgently called to check the escalator, but it was found to be in working order. 

Police are now compiling a report for Cardiff coroner Christopher Woolley and an inquest may be held. 

A House of Fraser spokeswoman said: 'It is with great sadness that we have learnt of the death of the woman who was involved in an incident in our Cardiff store on Christmas Eve.

'Our thoughts are with her family and friends.

'We would like to thank our staff for their initial first aid response and care administered to the customer and also the paramedics for their quick response.

A  Welsh Ambulance spokesman said: 'We were called to reports of three people falling down the escalator at the store. The three people were taken to the University of Wales Hospital.'
