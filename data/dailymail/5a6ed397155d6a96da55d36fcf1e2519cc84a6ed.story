Luck has certainly been delivered in threes at this Japanese zoo.

Himeji Central Park has seen three sets of extremely rare white lion cubs born at the zoo in the last month.

The zoo now has a total of seven new additions to their growing white lion pride - a remarkable feat considering there are only believed to be around 300 in existence across the globe.

Luck is delivered in threes: These young white lion cubs are the third set to be born at the Himeji Central Park in Japan within the last month

These adorable furballs, pictured at the amusement park in the city of Himeji, are the latest cubs to be born on June 30.

They were born shortly after two other female white lions from South African giving birth to litters - on June 26 and June 6.

The cubs will go on public display for the first time later this week.

Zoo officials said this is the first time white lions have been born at a zoo in western Japan.

White lions are not albinos. Like blue eyes in humans, the animals' white colour is caused by a recessive gene shared by both parents.

White lions are native to only the Greater Timbavati region of South Africa, an area characterised by white sandy riverbeds and long grass scorched pale by the sun.

They are regarded as sacred animals by the people of that region, but after Europeans 'discovered' them in the 1970s, many were taken from the wild to captive breeding and hunting operations, according to the Global White Lion Protection Trust.

These removals, along with lion culling and trophy hunting of male lions, depleted the gene pool and the animals have technically been extinct in the wild for the past 12 years.

In their natural habitat, white lions are regarded as 'apex predators', able to hunt successfully in day and night and take down prey as large as giraffes.

Despite their rarity, white lions are not yet classified as endangered because biologists still regard them as ultimately the same as their tawny equivalents.

The Global White Lion Protection Trust is campaigning for white lions to be recognised as a subspecies of lions, so that they can be protected under international law.

However, the genetic marker that makes white lions unique has not yet been identified by scientists and research into the animals is ongoing.

The trust estimates that there are no more than 300 white lions in existence. In recent years it has reintroduced the animals to a nature reserve within Greater Timbavati in an effort to eventually reintroduce the gene to wild lions.
