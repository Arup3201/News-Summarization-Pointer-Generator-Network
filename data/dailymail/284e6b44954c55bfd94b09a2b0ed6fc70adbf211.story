Bad Santa: Gary Cooper has been given an ASBO to stop him recreating his 2011 Christmas grotto

A homeless man branded a 'Bad Santa' after he turned a bus shelter into a grotty Christmas grotto last year has been slapped with an ASBO to stop him doing it again.

Police issued the mugshot of Gary Cooper, 50, after he was made subject of Anti-Social Behaviour Order to prevent him decorating the shelter near Penarth, South Wales.

Council workmen tore down decorations in 2011 - and police have gone to court this 
year to stop him putting them up again.

Last year the Father Christmas 
lookalike donned a Santa suit to greet passers-by and spent £30 of his 
benefits to deck out the bus shelter with a tree, tinsel and stocking.

But the grotto at Comeston bus stop was dismantled by council officials shortly before Christmas Day.

Gary has branded council officials 'Scrooges' for banning him from celebrating the festive season in style again this year.

The ex-jockey said: 'I’m just a 
Christmas kind of guy. I’ve been homeless for the last few years and I 
just wanted it to be perfect.

'Everybody thought it was a great attraction but the council said they were going to take my stuff unless I took it down.

'I think it’s ridiculous they’ve stopped me again, I’ve got no idea why I had to take my decorations down last year.

'They obviously have no festive spirit.'

The ASBO restricts Gary's behaviour in the run-up to Christmas in the Cardiff, Penarth and Barry areas of South Wales.

A Christmas tipple is out of the question, as Gary will be in breach of his ASBO if he is found with an open alcoholic container in any public area.

He is also banned from urinating in any public place or abusing any member of the public or a police officer.

The application was made by South Wales Police on behalf of Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan local authorities.
