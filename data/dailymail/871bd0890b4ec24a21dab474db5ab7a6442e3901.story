An Ohio Army veteran who lost the fight with local officials over therapy ducks that he says ease his post-traumatic stress disorder and depression vowed to continue fighting.

Darin Welker, 36, was found guilty of a minor misdemeanor on Wednesday and fined $50 plus court fees for keeping farm animals in West Lafayette in violation of municipal law.

'The ordinance says there are no ducks, then there are no ducks,' prosecutor James Skelton told Judge Timothy France according to the Coshocton Tribune. 'Your hands are tied.'

Therapy: Ohio vet Darin Welker, 36 says he will continue fighting to keep his 6 ducks, which a judge ruled to be in violation of a village ordinance

West Lafayette, about 80 miles from Columbus, passed an ordinance in 2010 that prohibited residents from keeping 'live poultry or fowl of any kind' including ducks within village limits. 

Welker's wife, Shirley Wagner, testified that the ducks are registered with a national emotional support animal service and that no neighbors have brought complaints about them to the family.

Judge France said he was favorable to the idea, but that the laws 'make sense' and should be enforced.

West Lafayette amended the ordinance in September to include allowances for two therapy animals per household, but the animals require approval from village council and a medial provider. 

According to the Daily News, Welker isn't giving up yet, saying, 'I'm gonna take it to the very end and push it as far as it can be pushed.'

Welker served one tour of duty in Iraq with the Army National guard in 2005, a particularly violent period of the war.

Ducks: Welker adopted 10 Pekin ducks and 4 mallards when they were days old, though later gave away 8 of his ducks

He returned with a back back. and the Department of Veteran Affairs paid for surgery in 2012, but did not cover physical therapy his doctor recommended and provided no mental health coverage.

In March, Welker adopted 14 ducks when they were just days old. Though he later gave 8 away, he said keeping the ducks has eased his PTSD and depression, and led to taking less medication.

'Taking care of them is both mental and physical therapy,' said Welker. 'Watching them 'keeps you entertained for hours at a time.'

'He can come out if he's having real bad day and pick them up,' Wagner told WBNS. 'Talk to them, bare his soul to them and they're not going to tell a soul.' 

A Change petition directed at Mayor Jack Patterson circulated in July after news of the local battle became national news, garnering over 80,000 signatures.

Patterson himself seemed baffled by the attention, and says that Welker can still keep two of the ducks under the village's amended ordinance.

'As long as they're less than 20 pounds each, he can have two therapy animals of whatever he wants and that's the ordinance and he knows that,' Patterson said.
