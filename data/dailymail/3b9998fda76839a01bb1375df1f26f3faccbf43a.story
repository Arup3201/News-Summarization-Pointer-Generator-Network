A lot of football fans claim to be dedicated to their football clubs, many even describe it as a religion.

Some wear replica shirts when they go to games, and others have their team’s club crest tattooed on their bodies.

But a Liverpool fan from Norway has taken it just that little bit further, having confessed to Norwegian paper Dagbladet he has a daughter called Karolina YNWA.

Liverpool supporting couple were set to name their baby Gerrard after Steven Gerrard if it was a boy

Using an acronym of your club's song as your child's name is certainly a unique way of expressing love for a football team thousands of miles away.

But Eirin Isabell Iversen, the five-year-old girl's mum, doesn't seem to mind as she revealed they had plans to name the baby Gerrard if it was a boy.

“I'm probably not as interested in football, but it was actually my suggestion to call her ‘YNWA’. He suggested ‘Gerrard’ before we knew it was a boy or a girl," she said.

"We could not force her to support Liverpool but she is very proud of her name."
