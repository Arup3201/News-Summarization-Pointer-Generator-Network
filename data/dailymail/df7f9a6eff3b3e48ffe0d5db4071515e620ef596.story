A British snowboarder is fighting for his life in hospital after he was dragged under a giant piste-basher machine in the Austrian Alps suffering horrific injuries.

The 35-year-old man, from West Sussex, was reportedly crushed between the front of the vehicle and its drive chain on the slopes at the Solden ski resort in the Tyrol.

Witnesses say he and another British holidaymaker were overtaking the snow truck on the piste while snowboarding side by side.

A local news report said he became trapped in the area between the drive train and the snowblower at the back of the vehicle.

Cable car workers rushed to help and and a German doctor who happened to be nearby administered first aid at the scene. A spokesman for the cable car company said the man had been injured in the shoulder and chest areas.

He said: 'One was trying the push the other along a flat section and the next moment he was under the machine.'

A spokesman for Ski Total who the group had booked their holiday through said: 'The injured man was snowboarding with friends on the Giggijoch ski area of Sölden, Austria. 

'Our understanding is that they were on a relatively easy slope and the weather conditions were not adverse. 

'He was given first aid immediately by the Sölden ski-lift company staff who also called the emergency services. 

'He was then helicoptered to Innsbruck Hospital for treatment, where he currently remains.

'At present we have no further specific details as to his injuries as the hospital are clearly dealing with his medical needs and liaising directly with his family.

'Meanwhile we are doing everything we can to support and assist his travelling companions and family.'

Police say the victim was helicoptered to hospital in Innsbruck after Tuesday's accident where he remains in intensive care.

'There
was a doctor from Germany there on the slope who gave him first aid 
before the paramedics and helicopter got there but he was very badly 
injured,' said police.

Piste bashers, also known as snow groomers, have wide metal caterpillar tracks, allowing them to operate on steep icy ski slopes.

 A spokesman for the foreign office said: 'We have seen the reports and are urgently looking into them.

'We stand ready to offer consular assistance at this difficult time.
