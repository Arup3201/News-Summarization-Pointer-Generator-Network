Rush-hour Underground commuters can sometimes resemble a herd of sheep - but that is usually where the association with agricultural ends.

However, travellers on Thursday were left bemused after two goats and an alpaca  walked brazenly and unchecked through a ticket barrier at Vauxhall Underground Station.

There was no need for any Oyster cards as the plucky visitors Fred, Barney and Ben navigated the London station seemingly unaware of the hysteria around them.

Commuters could scarcely believe their eyes as they uploaded photos to social media websites.

One Twitter user commented: 'Vauxhall Tube always has some weird characters running around. But this one looks friendlier than most.'

The animals from Vauxhall City Farm appeared happy and content as they waded through a multitude of onrushing passengers - all caught on camera. 

You've got to be kidding me! A goat wanders through the ticket barrier at Vauxhall Tube in London

Coming through! The animals went on the Tube as part of an initiative to get Londoners to visit attractions

The campaign named Transport for London's Without Leaving London was devised with the aim of encouraging Londoners to visit attractions in their home city.

Station by station the new illustration shows the variety of enjoyable things to see and do for little or no cost above one of the most popular Tube lines. 

Nigel Holness, Operations Director at London Underground said the campaign was being well received. 

He said: 'The above ground map of the Victoria line is a great way of illustrating some of the many enjoyable things to do and see without leaving London – including seeing goats and alpacas right here in the city.'
