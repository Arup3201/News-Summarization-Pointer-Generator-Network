A rugby player sidelined for his abnormally large feet can play again - thanks to a specially delivered pair of size 21 orange boots from Welsh rugby captain Sam Warburton. 

Carl Griffiths, 22, was forced to sit on the bench for his club side after wearing out his last pair and he could not find replacement footwear. 

But now, the 6ft 8in forward can return to the fold after being fitted with a pair of custom-made, orange Adidas boots.

The 6ft 8in forward had been unable to play for almost half a year, but is now able to play again

Mr Griffiths gleefully laces up his new orange boots at the home of his local club, Trimsaran RFC 

Mr Griffiths, who lives in Carmarthenshire, West Wales, had been playing in size 18 boots for the past three years with his toes curled up in the ends. 

But after keeping them together with black sticky tape, they eventually fell apart.

With his height, his club Trimsaran RFC miss him on the pitch, particularly in the line-outs. 

Desperate to play, Mr Griffiths contacted every major sports company he could think of asking if they had 21 size boots - 11 sizes bigger than the average man - but had no joy. 

But finally, after almost half a year stuck on the sidelines, they can welcome him back to the side thanks to the hand-delivered parcel from Warburton, who holds the record for the most Wales caps as captain. 

Mr Griffiths was cheering his team on from the touchline when the Welsh no 7 arrived with the parcel.

He then laced them up before running out for his first game in months. 

He said: 'It is amazing to be able to play the game I love again - and be able to wiggle my toes in my boots!

'I can't thank Sam and the guys at Adidas enough for making these boots especially for me. 

'I had no idea they were planning this and I had almost given up hope of ever finding boots that would fit me again.'

The 6ft 8in forward was delighted to meet Warburton, who presented him with the boots at Trimsaran RFC 

Warburton said: 'As soon as the team at Adidas told me about this story I bit their hand off to be involved. 

'I’ve had my fair share of injuries and breaks from the game over the years and I know it’s one of the worst feelings you can have.

'It’s great to have been involved in getting Carl back on the rugby field and you can tell it means a lot to him and his team mates.

'I’m sure they’ll be reminding him that he has some big boots to fill now though.'

He had been playing in size 18 boots with his toes curled up, but eventually his feet came through the boots

The 22-year-old has size 21 feet - 11 sizes bigger than the average man, but can now play rugby again 

It is believed Mr Griffiths' enormous feet are the result of drugs he was given to combat childhood leukaemia.

He was eight years old when doctors discovered he was suffering from the disease, and after a course of chemotherapy he was treated with steroids to help him regain his strength.

His feet sprouted within a year of stopping steroid treatment at 13 after he was given the all-clear, which is unusual because steroids usually restrict growth.
