Emergency workers were today still searching for victims of France's worst rail crash in quarter of a century as it emerged that the crash was caused by a loose connector on the tracks.

It came as police reported looters trying to steal from the bodies of victims who were electrocuted or crushed to death.

At least six people died in the horrific accident on the outskirts of Paris on Friday night, with eight critically injured.

Dozens of others suffered lighter wounds, including British passengers among the 385 on board the Limoges-bound service.

Equipment: Cranes were brought to the scene to clear debris from the crash site

Investigate: Policemen and firefighters search the site of the crash for evidence of how the train was derailed

Upsetting: At least six people perished in the horrific accident on the outskirts of Paris on Friday night. Police officers investigate the scene of the crash

Pierre Izard, a spokesman for SNCF, France's national railways company, said a metal bar connecting two rails had become detached close to Bretigny-sur-Orge station.

Referring to a switch joint, Mr Izard said: 'It moved into the centre of the switch and in this position it prevented the normal passage of the train's wheels and it may have caused the derailment.'

The train was travelling at 85mph - under the speed limit of 93mph, said Mr Izard, who added: 'The SNCF considers itself responsible for the lives of its clients.'

Today a crane was due to arrive at the scene to lift a mangled carriage which flipped over when the train hit a station platform.

'The fear is that victims may still be trapped in the wreckage,' said a French railways manager at the scene. 'The recovery operation will be carrying on all day.'

Injuries: Dozens of other passengers suffered lighter wounds, including British passengers among the 385 on board the Limoges-bound service

Probe: Police officers walk along the tracks at the site of the train crash today

A police spokesman described groups of local people 'picking through the wreckage' on Friday night.

'It appeared at first that they were trying to help, but it soon became clear that they were taking personal property away. When police approached they threw stones before running away.'

The crash site, some 16 miles from the centre of Paris, is surrounded by waste land used as a temporary home by vagrants and recent immigrants to France, mainly from eastern Europe.

Six carriages derailed in all, with the third and fourth leaving the rail first, at around 5.14pm.

Other carriages soon followed, with one mounting the station platform, a preliminary enquiry has established. It is being carried out by SNCF, judicial authorities and the BEA safety agency.

French transport minister Frederic Cuvillier has ruled out 'human error' - instead praising the train driver for averting an even more serious accident.

Horrific: An intercity train carrying 385 passengers, traveling from Paris towards Limoges, derailed crashing into a station platform leaving six people dead and a further 26 injured

Disaster: The seven carriage train split in two and then buckled

Mr Cuvillier said today: 'Fortunately,
the driver of the locomotive had absolutely extraordinary reflexes in 
that he sounded the alarm immediately, preventing a collision with 
another train coming in the opposite direction and which would have hit 
the derailing carriages within seconds. So it was not a human problem.'

He said investigators would be concentrating on the rolling stock, the infrastructure, and, in particular, the points.

French transport routes were particularly busy on Friday afternoon because of the Bastille Day national holiday on Sunday.

French
President Francois Hollande visited the scene on Friday evening, 
saying: 'We should avoid unnecessary speculation. What happened will 
eventually be known and the proper conclusions will be drawn.'

British student Marvin Khareem Wone was among those on another train when the intercity ploughed into the station.

He
told the BBC: 'The train went off the railway - it just went on the 
platform and kind of flew in the air for a second and went upside down.

'The
first and the second coach were completely destroyed. I really thought 
no-one could survive that because it was completely mashed up. Everyone 
was crying and running everywhere. A woman was crying for her daughter 
who was still on the train.'

Vianey
Kalisa, who was also at the station, said: 'I saw many wounded women 
children trapped inside. People were screaming. A man had blood on his 
face. These are images of war'.

The train had left Paris-Austerlitz station at 4.53pm on Friday, and was due to arrive in Limoges at 8.05pm.

Foreign
Secretary William Hague yesterday expressed 'shock' at the disaster. 
Officials said yesterday they were checking whether any UK nationals 
were involved.

'My thoughts 
are with the victims and their families. The British Embassy in Paris is
in close touch with the French authorities and stands by to provide any
assistance required," Mr Hague said.

The
high speed intercity train was travelling from the French capital to 
the city of Limoges when it derailed onto its side in the suburb of Bretigny-sur-Orge at about 3.15pm GMT.

The accident left six people dead, with the victims being crushed to death or electrocuted.

Many passengers desperately scrambled 
to safety after smashing windows and crawling out while covered in glass
and other debris. 

Englishman Graham Hope suffered a head injury, saying: ‘The train just 
started to rock up and down like a bucking bronco and the next thing we 
hit the station itself.

'The train bounced up and down dramatically for 
several seconds.’

The seven 
carriage train, which ‘split in two’ and then 'buckled', said Mr Hope.

John Paul Martial, who lives opposite the station, said: ‘I heard like a
big loud noise, coupled with a great shock, like an earthquake.

‘When I looked, there was a huge plume of smoke billowing above the 
rails. I was listening to the radio then  I realised what had 
happened.’

Horrific pictures from the scene showed that the train had ploughed into
the commuter station, with its carriages partly demolishing a platform.

Bazgua El Mehdi, 19, said: ‘I heard a loud noise and then a cloud of 
debris covered everything. Then I saw people getting off.

'One man had 
was barely conscious, with a bad wound to his head.’

Eyewitness Frederic said he ‘heard the screams’ of passengers caught up in the twisted metal.

The
computer programmer, who lives in a building opposite the entrance to 
the station with his wife Christine, said: ‘We heard a deafening barrage
in two stages, first the sound of train wheels that scrape the ballast 
then a loud crackling of metal.

Nasty: This aerial image shows how the train ploughed through one of the platforms at the station

Shock: Eyewitnesses reported hearing a loud noise before seeing a cloud of debris

'Large ballast stones were thrown about ten feet around, falling on adjacent streets. Even our building shook.

‘From my balcony, I saw a cloud of 
dust rising, then I saw the carnage. I didn’t see any bodies, but I 
heard the screams. People could be seen running - fleeing from the 
station.’

It is a national holiday weekend in 
France because of Bastille Day on Sunday, meaning many families heading 
down south with children.
