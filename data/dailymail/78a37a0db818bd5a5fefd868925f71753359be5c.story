A wrongful death lawsuit seeking at least $1 million has been filed against a 75-year-old Detroit-area woman who was convicted of killing her 17-year-old grandson.

The lawsuit was filed recently in Oakland County Circuit Court against Sandra Layne and her husband Fred Layne, 86, by a representative of Jonathan Hoffman's estate.

Layne's attorney Jerome Sabbota told the Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News that he's not surprised by the lawsuit. Sabbota notes that Layne's husband wasn't charged in the killing.

Jailed: Sandra Layne, 75, is seen being led out of court after being sentenced to at least 22 years in prison in April 2013 for killing her grandson

Tears: Sandra Layne sobbing heavily during proceedings, as she did during this court appearance on March 13

Hoffman was shot six times, including twice in the back, in West Bloomfield Township in 2012.

Layne
said she shot him out of fear during a physical altercation, but a jury
rejected her claim of self-defense and convicted her of second-degree 
murder.

Layne was sentenced to at least 22 years in prison in April of this year and is currently in prison.

Sandra
Layne got a minimum sentence of 20 years for second-degree murder, 
along with a mandatory two-year sentence for using a gun to kill 
17-year-old Jonathan Hoffman.

Prosecutors said there were no signs of Layne being injured by Hoffman. A recording of a 911 call shows him being shot again while pleading for help - a critical piece of evidence that jurors played over and over during deliberations in April, 2013.

Judge Denise Langford Morris zeroed in on it, too, wondering why Layne simply didn't call police if she felt helpless.

Devastated: The husband of Sandra Layne, 87-year-old Fred Layne openly wept as the verdict was read in April - he was not charged

Grief: Jennifer Hoffman, right, mother of shooting victim Jonathan Hoffman, called her mother a 'monster' after she was convicted in March

'Grandmothers are supposed to protect... Why did you keep shooting and how could you keep shooting?' Morris asked. 

'You didn't have to keep shooting. Those were hollow-pointed bullets designed for a devastating impact.'

Layne
sobbed heavily during a long, rambling address to the judge, her belly 
chains and handcuffs sagging over orange jail clothes on her slight 
frame.

Tragic: Jonathan Hoffman, 17, was shot dead by his grandmother in the spring of 2012

'I'm sorry for what I did. I apologize 
to everyone I've hurt, everyone... Sorry is too small a word,' she 
said, pleading with Morris to not allow her to die in prison.

Layne's daughter, Jennifer Hoffman, urged the judge to show no mercy.

'She showed no mercy when she planned, stalked and murdered my son in 
his bedroom. Sandra Layne is pure evil and if given the opportunity 
would surely kill again,' Jennifer Hoffman said.

Hoffman's father did not attend the 
hearing because he was in Arizona with his 16-year-old daughter, 
Jessica, who was recovering from a tumor.

Michael Hoffman said the girl 
'has a hole in her heart to match the hole in her head' since her 
brother's death.

In a letter read by the prosecutor, 
the father said Layne 'put on her war paint and came in gunning for my 
boy.'

He accused Layne of killing his son because he was ready to move 
on after high school and she would no longer be able to control him.

Hoffman was living with his grandmother during his last year of high school while his parents lived in Arizona where a daughter was being treated for a brain tumor.

He had a history of drug use and had tested positive for synthetic marijuana on the day of the shooting. Layne claimed he feared flunking probation and demanded money and a car to leave the area.

Prosecutors, however, said Hoffman 
was wearing just shorts and socks when he was killed and had made plans 
to see a friend that night, not flee.

Prosecutor
Paul Walton, noting the minutes that went by before Layne shot the boy 
again, said he had never handled a homicide 'this cold, this long and 
this calculating.'

Layne 
blamed the parents for not taking Jonathan back to Arizona and said her 
grandson's drug use made him unmanageable for an elderly woman.

She
accused Michael Hoffman of giving up on the boy and said she pleaded 
with the pair to return to Michigan when drugs landed him in the 
hospital.

'If I could go 
back, I never would have bought that gun,' Layne told the judge. 'I 
would have said to his parents it's their responsibility, help him, take
him.'

Following the verdict, Ms Hoffman told the Detroit Free Press that she was happy that her mother had been found guilty.

She added: 'I know my son is in heaven and that is a place she’ll never see.'

Hoffman had been living with his grandparents since 2011 when his parents divorced and moved to Arizona.

The elderly woman's husband Fred Layne wept in court as his wife was shackled and taken away by officers.
