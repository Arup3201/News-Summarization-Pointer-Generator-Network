Former Newcastle United striker Faustino Asprilla handed an aircraft pilot a bottle so he would not have to leave his co-pilot alone if he needed to go to the toilet mid-flight. 

The Colombian-born football star was after boarding a flight in Moscow when he approached the flight deck. 

He told his 102,000 followers on Instagram that he expressed his fears to the pilot as a result of the recent Germanwings tragedy where pilot Andreas Lubitz crashed his jet into the Alps.

Sitting on an aircraft, Asprilla told his followers: 'I went to the pilot's cabin. I strictly forbid the pilot to get out and urinate because if that other lunatic locks the door in, it will happen what happened in that other flight. Everyone knows. 

'If he wants to urinate, I have him an empty bottle of water.' 

Asprilla played for Newcastle United between 1996 and 1998, although manager Kenny Dalglish had problems with the Colombian's playboy lifestyle.  

Earlier, Asprilla tweeted a photograph of himself looking nervous in an airport departure lounge with an aircraft over his shoulder.

Faustino Asprilla told his 100,000 Instagram followers that he warned an airline pilot against taking a mid-flight toilet break during his recent flight. The former Newcastle United star gave the pilot a bottle instead.

Asprilla joined Newcastle from Italian club Parma and returned after his two-year stay on Tyneside.

However, the club is facing serious problems, having been officially declared bankrupt while their chairman Giampietro Maneti was arrested for money laundering. 

The club faces debts of £60 million.
