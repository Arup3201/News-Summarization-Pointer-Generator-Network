A U.S. Air Force lieutenant who damaged a precious statue belonging to a celebrity dog trainer during a marathon pub crawl was today fined almost £1,200.

Christopher Mesnard began his binge drinking session in a champagne bar at London Paddington train station and had planned to drink half a pint in 26 bars along the Underground's Circle line.

But the 26-year-old lost his friends and was found in the early hours of the morning astride a fake topiary dog owned by dog trainer Lucy Kennedy, Hammersmith Magistrates' Court heard.

First Lieutenant Mesnard, a Deputy Chief of Public Affairs in the USAF based at Royal Air Force Mildenhall in Suffolk, broke the £995 ornament but claimed to have no recollection of the incident.

Police were called at around 12:30am on March 30 following an allegation of criminal damage by Miss Kennedy, who trains pampered dogs for TV shows, the court was told.

Manjit Mahal, prosecuting, said: ‘Miss Kennedy explained to officers she was at her property in her bedroom when she was disturbed by a noise outside.'

After investigating the 'banging' noise, Miss Kennedy and her partner saw Mesnard fall off the statue which was bolted to the ground, the court heard.

Mesnard was found around 650ft away from the luxury home in Notting Hill, west London, on a road which has an average property value of £1.7million.

'My parents raised me to own up to my mistakes and take responsibility for my actions'

Mesnard was arrested and confessed he was on a pub crawl during a police interview.

Mr Mahal said: 'They started drinking at a champagne bar in Paddington station at approximately 11am on March 29.

'He got separated from his friends and he was texting his friends to find out if they were about. He accepts he was drunk but not incapable.’

Miss Kennedy, 54, has been described as 'Notting Hill's best known dog nanny' and runs her business Happy Dogs from her home.

Mesnard admitted a single charge of criminal damage to property valued under £5,000.

'He got separated from his friends and he was texting his friends to find out if they were about. He accepts he was drunk but not incapable'

Addressing the court, he apologised for his 'severe lapse' in judgement and confessed he does not yet know what punishment the Air Force will impose on him.

'I wish I could remember having damaged Ms Kennedy's property, but the fact is I unfortunately made the poor decision to drink too much,' he said.

'My parents raised me to own up to my mistakes and take responsibility for my actions.'

Mesnard, of RAF Mildenhall, was ordered to pay £995 in compensation to Miss Kennedy. He must also pay a £150 contribution towards court costs and a £25 victim surcharge.
