Lightning strikes have left thousands facing travel problems tonight on one of the busiest travel days of the year.

Sudden storms have hit the great summer holiday getaway with rail passengers encountering delays and cancellations on busy routes.

Trains between London Paddington and Reading, Swindon, Bristol and South Wales were ‘severely disrupted’ due to signalling problems between Reading and Maidenhead caused by an earlier lightning strike.

Commuters were stranded at Paddington station in Central London because of disruption to signals caused by a thunderstorm

Similar problems caused ‘major disruption’ to all routes across the South West Trains network, with services between London Waterloo and Surrey and Exeter affected.

The number of trains was severely cut after a lightning strike in the Surbiton area and signalling problems at Waterloo.

Commuters at Paddington and Waterloo posted pictures on Twitter showing the stations looking extremely congested.

Myles Dyer wrote: “I must admit, I hadn’t planned spending Friday night in London Paddington station. All trains delayed or cancelled!”

Andy Burne tweeted: “Absolutely chaos at Waterloo station, trains cancelled, station full of sweaty people.”

On one of the busiest travelling days of the year - as it is the first weekend after schools break up for the summer - there were other problems on the railways and also the roads.

An electrical supply problem meant delays to trains in Essex, while a person being hit by a train led to delays to services between King’s Cross station in London and Stevenage in Hertfordshire.

On the roads there were holds-ups on the M18 in East Yorkshire due to an accident involving two lorries.

There were also jams on a number of other major routes including the M25, the M5, the M6 and the M11.

Around Exeter, the M5 was almost at a standstill because of the volume of cars, caravans and vans heading for the beaches of Devon and Cornwall.

Today and the subsequent Saturdays in August are expected to the busiest days of the summer on the roads.

The first of an estimated two million Britons who are flying abroad over the weekend headed off last night.

Spain is the number one destination for those hitting continental hotspots, according to travel organisation Abta.

Bookings to Greece and Turkey have also been going well, while for those travelling further afield Dubai, Mexico and Florida are among the most popular destinations.

The recent hot weather has also boosted the numbers taking last-minute trips in the UK, while short-haul favourites include Barcelona, Amsterdam, Rome and Paris.

In south-east England, around 450,000 passengers will be departing from Heathrow this weekend, 295,000 from Gatwick, 140,000 from Stansted and 79,000 from Luton.

Around 162,000 are due to depart from Manchester, 70,000 from Birmingham, 45,000 from Bristol and 37,000 from East Midlands airport.
