Jazz Carlin moved safely into the 400 metres freestyle final little over 12 hours after becoming the first Welsh woman in 40 years to win Commonwealth Games swimming gold.

The Swansea swimmer was third in her heat at Tollcross, behind Canadian Brittany MacLean and Scotland's Hannah Miley.

New Zealand's Lauren Boyle, the woman Carlin beat to silver in the 800m, was the fastest qualifier while England's Ellie Faulkner claimed the last place in tonight's final.

Scottish hero Daniel Wallace swam down South Africa's Chad Le Clos to win his heat in the 200m individual medley.

Wallace, who took gold in the 400m, overtook the 10-time Commonwealth medallist during a brilliant breaststroke leg to record the second fastest time of the four heats behind Australia's Daniel Tranter.

Welshman Ieuan Lloyd beat 400m silver medallist Thomas Fraser-Holmes of Australia in his heat to qualify for the final along with England pair Roberto Pavoni and Joe Roebuck.
