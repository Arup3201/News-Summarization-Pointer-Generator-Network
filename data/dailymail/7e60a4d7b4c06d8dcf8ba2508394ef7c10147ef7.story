Overloaded and drifting, this is one of nine craft sharing a load of some 1,100 migrants off the coast of Sicily.

The latest wave of asylum seekers had to be rescued after they  were spotted just over 100 miles from the Italian island of Lampedusa – where 366 Eritreans drowned in a shipwreck in October.

Among those on the flotilla of unpowered craft, including huge inflatables, were at least 50 children.

The Italian navy dispatched four vessels to rescue the migrants, all of whom are from North Africa, after they were spotted by patrol helicopters.

Italy has become a major gateway into Europe for migrants, and sea arrivals more than tripled in 2013 from the previous year, fuelled by Syria’s civil war and strife in the Horn of Africa.

October’s tragedy was followed a week later by the deaths of another 200 migrants – mostly Syrians – in  a shipwreck.

The rescue on Wednesday came a day before nine people died in a similar bid trying to reach Spanish territory in Morocco.

The tragic swimmers were among 200 African migrants who tried to cross to the Spanish enclave of Ceuta from neighbouring Morocco on Thursday, the Spanish government said.

Spain has two enclaves in the north African country, Ceuta and Mellila, and migrants regularly try to reach them either by swimming along the coast or climbing the triple walls that separate them from Morocco.

The bodies of eight men and one woman were recovered from Moroccan waters, the Spanish government representative in Ceuta said.

The migrants had earlier tried to cross the razor-wire lined frontier, but gave up as Spanish police drove them back, the official added.
