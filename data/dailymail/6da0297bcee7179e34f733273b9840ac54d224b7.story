Dominique Strauss-Kahn was an ‘effective and decisive’ pimp who regularly hired prostitutes to ‘satisfy his sexual needs’, French judges believe.

The damning claims were made following an investigation in the so-called Carlton Affair, in which the former International Monetary Fund chief faces prison.

Details of the case against the 64-year-old were leaked to Le Figaro newspaper, following his indictment for ‘aggravating pimping’.

In court: Former International Monetary Fund head Dominique Strauss-Kahn tried to get pimping charges against him dropped

During a failed attempt to have the charges dropped on December 19th in Douai, northern France, the court heard that Strauss-Kahn was at the centre of a well organised prostitution racket based out of the Carlton Hotel, in the nearby city of Lille.

It included a so called ‘garconniere’ – a ‘bachelor pad’ in Paris which the married Strauss-Kahn would use to entertain his paid-for lovers.

Orgies are also said to have been held at luxury hotels all over the world, including in Washington DC, close to the IMF headquarters.

‘The judges felt that serious corroborating evidence make likely the effective and decisive participation of Dominique Strauss Kahn in acts of pimping,’ says Le Figaro.

The judges also consider that the pimping racket was primarily set up for Strauss Kahn in order to ‘satisfy his sexual needs’.

Separated: Dominique Strauss-Kahn was married to his wife Anne Sinclair, pictured outside Manhattan criminal court in 2011, at the time of the alleged offences

This is despite the fact that, at the time, he was allegedly happily married to the multi-millionaire art heiress and former TV presenter, Anne Sinclair, also 64.

Miss Sinclair regularly insisted that Strauss-Kahn was innocent of any wrong doing, but the couple have since separated.

Settlement: The former IMF chief paid Nafissatou Diallo, who accused him of sexual assault, £950,000

Strauss Kahn admits attending so-called ‘sex parties’, but insists he had no idea that any of the women were call girls.

A statement handed to the court by Strauss-Kahn’s lawyers said a charge of aggravated pimping was ‘unhealthy, sensationalist and not without a political agenda.’

But Guillaume Maigret, general secretary of the court, ordered that the case against Strauss-Kahn ‘should proceed’.

It comes after Strauss-Kahn made a £950,000 pay-off to the New York hotel cleaner who accused him of trying to rape her.

The disgraced economist and Nafissatou Diallo reached the agreement to end all legal action for sexual assault against him in America.

Strauus-Kahn - once tipped as a future Socialist president of France - was arrested in May 2011 for trying to rape the 30-year-old at a Sofitel in Manhatten.

He claimed Ms Diallo had consented to sex but, after criminal charges were dropped, she prepared a civil case for a ‘violent and sadistic attack’ that ‘robbed her of her dignity as a woman’.

Strauss-Kahn was also accuse of sexually abusing a young French writer in Paris, but those allegations were dropped because they took place too long ago.

Strauss-Kahn recently made a discreet return to public life, giving a speech on the global finances in China and advising the Greek government on their massive debts.

His trial for pimping, for which he faces a prison sentence, will take place at a date to be fixed.
