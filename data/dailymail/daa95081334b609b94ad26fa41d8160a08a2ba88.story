You'd have to be pretty dippy not to be able to boil an egg.

But if heating one in a pan of water on the hob and timing it for a few minutes seems far too complicated, you’re in luck.

A new convenience food called the Dippy Egg is about to hit supermarket shelves, apparently designed for those too inept to create the perfect runny yolk.

All-round good egg: The Dippy Egg is a pre-cooked boiled egg that promises soft yolks every time

Simple: Cooks can just cover the egg with boiled water and leave for five minutes, then it is ready to eat, with the lid serving as an egg cup

The Dippy Egg – a single pasteurised 
egg in its shell – is pre-boiled in an airtight plastic bag to just the 
right consistency before being sold in a plastic pot.

All the hungry consumer has to do is 
remove it from its plastic bag, put it back in the pot and pour on 
boiled water before replacing the lid and waiting five minutes.

When the egg is ready, it can be eaten from the lid, which doubles as an egg cup.

Even if left in hot water in its pot 
for longer than five minutes, manufacturer Pork Farms says the yolk will
still not set. 

Tasty snack: The product is still being tested but should be ready for September

Trade magazine The Grocer said yesterday: ‘Too busy, or 
too stupid, to boil an egg? The Dippy Egg is set to help.’ It filmed the
process and put the footage on its website.

Pork Farms will sell the Dippy Egg 
from September. Spokesman Mark Hodson said the egg-cup lid meant it 
could be eaten at home or at work.

He added: ‘We are looking at 
innovation in traditional markets.’

The adventurous could, of course, trying boiling an egg from scratch themselves.

TV chef Delia Smith advises covering 
an egg in a pan with cold water. Bring it to the boil, then simmer 
gently for three minutes for a really soft-boiled egg, four for a white 
that is just set and a yolk that is creamy, and five minutes for a set 
white and yolk that is just a little squidgy in the centre.

Perfect for soldiers: The new product makes sure the yolk is just the right consistency for dipping
