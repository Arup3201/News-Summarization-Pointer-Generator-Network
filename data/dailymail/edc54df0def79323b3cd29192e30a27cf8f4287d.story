They do say a safari trip gets you up close and personal to some of the most beautiful, and yet ferocious wild animals.

And in this video, one family show no fear as they hand-feed a tiger from within their tour truck.

The unusually close-up footage was captured by a lady who visited Zoobic Safari in Subic Olongapo, Philippines with her five-year-old son earlier this month.

There may be bars between tiger and human, but the fingers come worryingly close to the beast's mouth

There are squeals of delight as the big cat clambers on top of the vehicle, and the lady captures the whole scene on video. 

The truck accelerates on, but the tiger keeps its balance on the roof, until finally clambering off once the vehicle parks up.

The sheer size of the tigers jaws and teeth become apparent as people began to feed raw meat to the big cat.

Although bars separate the animal from the tourists, the fingers come a bit too close for comfort to the giant and razor-sharp incisors. 

The Zoobic Safari is a 25-hectare wildlife sanctuary located in the Subic Bay Freeport Zone  of the country.

'Hold on to your seats as you enter a two-hectare enclosed area aboard our customized Safari Jeep and experience the thrill of being chased by full-grown tigers on the loose,' is how the park's website chillingly describes the trek.
