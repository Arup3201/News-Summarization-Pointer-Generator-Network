In hiding: Former U.S. spy and intelligence leaker Edward Snowden is holed up in Russia

Britain's ability to track terrorists and crime gangs has been severely damaged as a result of the intelligence leaks by ex-U.S. spy Edward Snowden, the Home Secretary revealed yesterday.

One year on from the whistleblower’s actions, police and security services are finding it harder to monitor the electronic communications used by fanatics and master criminals, Theresa May warned.

She said the issue must be addressed – raising the prospect of new laws to help GCHQ, police and others to intercept emails and phone calls.

Mrs May told the Royal United Services Institute: ‘People talk about national security versus civil liberties, but you can only enjoy your liberty if you have security.’

Fugitive Snowden has been accused of compromising secret surveillance techniques by passing up to 1.7million stolen top secret documents to The Guardian.

It is estimated a quarter of the serious criminals being tracked by GCHQ have fallen off the radar following the leak – described by security officials as the biggest in modern history – because they have been alerted to the methods being used to track them.

One senior intelligence source said the UK’s electronic eavesdropping centre had also suffered a ‘sizeable reduction’ in its ability to gather intelligence on terrorists.

Ministers have also been hit by a European Court ruling which means that internet and communications companies can no longer be forced to store data such as phone records.

This information is vital to police and intelligence agencies in establishing who a suspect has made contact with and when. Mrs May suggested there was a need for a charm offensive to repair the damage done by Snowden’s claims that there is mass surveillance of the public.

‘There is a need to get out there more generally the importance of intelligence in fighting all of these national security threats,’ she said.

‘We will try to find innovative ways of getting the importance of these activities to members of the public.’

Mrs May has previously run into political trouble by promoting plans for a so-called snoopers’ charter, which would allow the police and security services to access every internet click as well as phone calls and emails.

The last proposal was scuppered when Nick Clegg withdrew Liberal Democrat support.

But Home Office sources stress the current issue is about protecting the capabilities the police and security services already have to monitor electronic communications, not giving them extra powers.

Sir David Omand, a former director of GCHQ, has said the disclosures by Snowden, who is holed up in Russia, had led to some of GCHQ’s operations being shut down.

He said: ‘There is no doubt in my mind that substantial damage to UK security has been caused by the Snowden revelations... I think it inevitable that many of those who have something to hide will have... changed their communication methods as a result.’

U.S. National Security Agency deputy director Rick Ledgett has said the stolen files contained ‘the keys to the kingdom’ and MI5 director general Andrew Parker called Snowden’s actions a ‘gift to terrorists’.

Snowden claims the U.S. government’s actions were a ‘threat to democracy’. Much of the stolen information was revealed by The Guardian and The Washington Post.

But there are mounting suspicions he had been recruited – unwittingly or not – by foreign agents.

Intelligence chiefs believe he is now passing military details to President Putin’s spies.
