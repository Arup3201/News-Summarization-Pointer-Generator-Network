A businesswoman dubbed the City Supermum for balancing a highly successful career with having nine children still gets home at 6pm every day to do the ironing, it has been revealed.

Helena Morrissey, chief executive of the Newton Investment Management company, said women 'overthink' when the right time to have children is and its potential impact on their careers.

The mother-of-nine, who lives in Notting Hill, London, and earned the nickname of 'billion-dollar babe' in reference to the £51bn of assets under her management, is also the founder of the 30 Per Cent Club, campaigning to make UK boardrooms 30 per cent female by 2015.

Helena Morrissey, chief executive of the Newton Investment Management company, said women also 'overthink' when the right time to have children is and its potential impact on their careers

The mother-of-nine,  (pictured with four of her daughters) who lives in Notting Hill, London, and earned the nickname of 'billion-dollar babe' in reference to the £51bn of assets under her management, is also the founder of the 30 Per Cent Club, a pressure group campaigning to make UK boardrooms 30 per cent female by 2015

But the 48-year-old insists that having children shouldn't impact on a woman's career.

In an interview with Evening Standard City Editor Chris Blackhurst, she said: 'My advice would be not to overthink it. I believe having a few months or a year out in what might be a 40 year career is neither here nor there.'

Her children - six girls and three boys all ranging in age from 6 and 23 - were cared for both by her husband, who gave up his journalism career to help raise the children, and by the family nanny. 

But in an interview with The Times, Mrs Morrissey's 19-year-old daughter Flo revealed that despite her impressive career and influence, she is still a hands-on mother - even extending to keeping on top of the mountains of housework after her working day is done.

The singer-songwriter said: 'She's very much as she's portrayed, but I don't actually know how she does it. She's really hands-on with us.

The one-woman powerhouse has in the past revealed that on each of her short maternity leaves she keeps track of the markets and works from home

Spouse: The school run and caring for the children during the day is done by the nanny or by her husband Richard (pictured), 43, a Buddhist monk who used to work in financial publishing

'We've had a nanny who's been there since I was zero, so she is part of the family, but my mum gets home at six every day and we have dinner together, as a family, every night. 

'My dad cooks but i'll do the washing up and my mum does the ironing.' 

The one-woman powerhouse has in the past revealed that on each of her short maternity leaves she keeps track of the markets and works from home. 

She has said: 'Although my maternity leaves are short, they are intense. Then it's a gradual handover to my husband and the nanny.'

She said her daily routine includes pitches to clients, transatlantic phone calls, trips to school plays, overnight dashes to Boston, sorting gym kit and laundry and picking up children.

However, the school run and caring for the children during the day is done by the nanny or by her husband Richard, 43, a Buddhist monk who used to work in financial publishing.
