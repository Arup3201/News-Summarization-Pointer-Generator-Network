Once at the heart of the Silk Road trade route, Herat in western Afghanistan has a long tradition of producing silk used to weave carpets and silk. 

The process dates back thousands of years and has kept thousands of families who live there in business. 

However, Afghanistan has suffered more than most as a country after decades of war and unrest.

The once flourishing silk trade that it was so proud of has been threatened by cheaper foreign imports which threatened generations of silkmaking families.

Supply routes and exports of silk were effectively cut off during the Afghan-Russian war of 1979-89, and the industry was further diminished under the Taliban, which refused women access to factory work and education

However, the Department of Agriculture has now offered the families of Herat a lifeline - by providing some 5,050 silkworm boxes to several districts to revive silk production in the region.

Some 42,500 women and their families are involved in the project which aims to provide a means of subsistence and potentially lead the international market access for silk producers in the country.

Herat is ideal as the mulberry trees which the silkworms feed on thrive in the dry climate.

The popular wool and silk Afghan carpets made by different tribes can sell for a price that can cost thousands of pounds.

Carpets are Afghanistan's best-known export, woven mostly by women and children in the north of the country, a trade which once employed, directly or indirectly, six million people, or a fifth of the country's population, although that figure has dropped sharply. 

In
 recent years cheaper, synthetic silk has been bought as an alternative 
but as with any material which is cheaper to produce and buy, the 
quality is also lessened. 

A
 pure, silk scarf might cost around 400 Afghanis (£5), whereas a 
synthetic version which could be imported from nearby Pakistan or China 
would only cost 150 Afghanis (£2).

The
 price of natural threads has doubled, and a once thriving stop on the 
'Silk Road' now faces its biggest challenge yet, not only to keep family
 tradition going, but to also make a profitable business out of it.

One
 kilogram of pure silk costs more than 3,000 Afghanis while synthetic 
Pakistani silk can be bought for 420 Afghanis per kilogram.

The
 Silk Road is used to describe a historical network of interlinking 
trade routes across the Afro-Eurasian landmass that connected East, 
South, and Western Asia with the Mediterranean and European world, as 
well as parts of North and East Africa.

The road extends over 4,000 miles and takes its name from the Chinese Silk trade.

It
 is not just silk that is traded on the Silk Road - goods such as 
ceramics, glass, precious metals, ivory, gems, medical herbs, exotic 
animals and livestock were exchanged also.

The
 Silk Road came into being from the 1st century BC, following efforts by
 the Yuezhi and Xiongnu in the Tarim Basin in north west China to 
consolidate a road to the Western world and India.
