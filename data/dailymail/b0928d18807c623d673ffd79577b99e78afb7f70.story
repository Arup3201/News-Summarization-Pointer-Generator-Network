A substitute teacher in a northern New Jersey school district is accused of sexually assaulting a 16-year-old student.

Passaic County Prosecutors say 21-year-old Linda Hardan, of Prospect Park, also is charged with child endangerment and criminal sexual contact.

The charges were filed Friday and made public on Saturday. 

Hardan, who is a Muslim, is accused of assaulting a 16-year-old student from Manchester Regional High School, where she worked as a substitute teacher. It is an Islamic belief that sexual urges should be fulfilled only through marriage.

Prosecutors say the alleged incident occurred Thursday in Wayne, but further details about the incident and the victim were not disclosed.

According to NorthJerysey.com, Hardan allegedly met up with the student outside of school hours.

She then transported him to a location in Wayne. 

The alleged sexual encounter occurred in the parked car. 

Hardan could face nearly 17 years in prison if convicted on all counts.

Scene: Hardan worked as a substitute teacher at Manchester Regional High School in Haledon, New Jersey

That is the total of 10 years in prison on the charge of sexual assault, up to five on the charge of endangering the welfare of a child and up to 18 months on the charge of criminal sexual contact.

She was remanded in custody on $250,000 bail. 

It was not known Saturday if Hardan had retained an attorney.
