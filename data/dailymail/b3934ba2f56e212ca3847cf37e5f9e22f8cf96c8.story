A married couple have both been charged with drunken driving after police say the man’s wife arrived drunk at the police barracks to pick up her husband following his arrest earlier on New Year’s Day.

Troopers say they stopped 53-year-old Steven Flick, of Meadville, Pennsylvania, shortly after 1 a.m. on Wednesday on Route 322 in Vernon Township.

Police say Flick tried to run away during his arrest, so was also charged him with resisting arrest.

His wife Kimberly Joy Flick then called the Meadville barracks about an hour later to make arrangements to pick up her husband, but was warned not to drive to the station if she, too, had been drinking.

Police say she disregarded the warning, arrived legally drunk, and so was also charged with drunken driving.

Online court records don’t list attorneys for the couple, who don’t have a listed phone.
