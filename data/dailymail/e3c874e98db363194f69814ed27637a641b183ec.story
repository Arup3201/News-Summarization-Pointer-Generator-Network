Plans to store billions of pieces of private information from emails, Facebook, texts and internet use are set to be scuppered by the Liberal Democrats.

They are ready to oppose a proposed £2billion law affecting everyone online or using a mobile phone which has been criticised as a snoopers' charter.

The potential threat comes as a powerful committee of MPs and peers is expected to publish a series of damning criticisms of the Communications Data Bill next week.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is expected to oppose the plans to store billions of pieces of private information in their entirety

These will include the verdict that it infringes civil liberties and invades privacy. Crucially, the committee will also suggest that ministers have not made the case for the measure.

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg is expected to use those conclusions to oppose the plans in their entirety.

He has previously insisted that he will not approve anything which threatens civil liberties.

A party source said: 'Obviously given how strongly Nick felt on this, we would take the recommendations of the committee very seriously.'

Mr Clegg met the Prime Minister this week to discuss the issue and was 'non-committal' about the Bill's future, the BBC reported.

Isabelle Sankey, director of policy for Liberty, called on MPs to 'oppose this snoopers' charter which has no place in a free society'.

Officials warn that unless a law is brought in new technology will allow terrorists to hatch plots or swap sickening images

She added: 'It would waste billions 
and pave the way for blanket surveillance of innocent citizens' personal
data. Home Office evidence to the committee has been woeful.'

The
Home Office insists the proposed storage of website visits for 12 
months, along with use of Skype and even online games consoles, will 
protect national security.

Without it, police and the security services will lose their ability to track the activities of crime gangs and paedophiles over time, they argue.

Officials warn that new technology will allow terrorists to hatch plots or swap sickening images. Gaps in coverage already mean the authorities have no access to a quarter of all communications data.

The plans would cover when and to whom a phone call was made, not what was said. The content of emails would also not be stored, just details of who sent and received them.

The joint committee on the Bill has examined it in detail and is likely to conclude that even collecting the data is open to abuse.

It may also contradict claims that it is possible to separate details of messages from their content.

There is strong opposition to the Bill among Lib Dem and Tory backbenchers. Crucially, Labour has yet to indicate how it will vote.

Committee member Julian Huppert has said the Bill is 'botched' and 'unfit in principle and detail'.
