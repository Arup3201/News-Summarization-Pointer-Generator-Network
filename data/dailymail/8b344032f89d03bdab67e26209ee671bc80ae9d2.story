The huge $111 million budget cut to Australia's national science agency announced in Prime Minister Tony Abbott's May budget has led to top scientists being forced to refill photocopiers, a report has claimed.

A senior CSIRO scientist has exposed the menial tasks they and their colleagues are now being forced to carry out because of the axing of 100 support staff.

The scientist, who is paid $150,000 a year, told the Sydney Morning Herald he is spending half a day a week washing glassware.  

'They're doing their best to keep the money in the science, but the consequence is that high-level scientists do a lot of menial tasks because there is no one else to do them,' he said. 

The man, who did not want to be named, said staff are being distracted from research because they have to clean laboratories, handle post and check chemical stocks.

Australia's top scientists have been forced to collect and distribute mail, impacting on the time they have for vital research 

CSIRO Staff Association Secretary Sam Popovski confirmed he has received feedback from staff about this problem.

'Most recently it has been around scientists collecting and distributing mail,' Mr Popovski told Daily Mail Australia.

'There is limited staff in a reception capacity also in storerooms, scientists are now picking up dangerous chemicals and coordinating the administrative part of that,' he said.

Mr Popovski explained that 100 support staff were cut earlier this year as part of the three hundred job losses in a CSIRO restructure.

He warned that there have also been cuts to support areas in previous years and it has been a cumulative trend rather than a one off.

'It's really important to hire people to do the work that needs to be done rather than having highly skilled scientists doing support staff work.

CSIRO, Australia's national science agency, has been heavily impacted by government cuts 

'Scientists immensely value the support staff as it allows them to get on and do their job,' Mr Popovski added.

CSIRO has three national research facilities, including the Australian Animal Health Laboratory at Geelong, Victoria and more than 30 other research facilities around the country.

In August it was announced CSIRO is shutting down its bowel cancer and neurological research programs, due to the budget cuts forcing a a 20 percent reduction of staff between June 2013 and June 2015.

'It's not a throwaway line about making CSIRO more efficient, these budget cuts directly result in shutting down areas of research, and we want our elected representatives to be more transparent about that,' Mr Popovski said.

'You're essentially down to the bare bones, there's not a lot left to cut. We want to make people making these decisions accountable as to what happens as a result.'

Due to funding cuts last year, there were 513 redundancies at CSIRO, reducing their total workforce from 6,500 by eight percent, to 5,964 in June 2013.

It is estimated that another 750 jobs will be cut across the organisation in the next financial year, meaning CSIRO will suffer a 20 percent reduction of staff in two years.

Bowel Cancer Australia CEO Julien Wiggins said the closure of CSIRO's bowel and rectal cancer research program was 'a step backwards', especially given that bowel cancer is the second biggest cancer killer in Australia.

'Any cuts to bowel cancer are of serious concern. 15,000 people are diagnosed each year, and funding to bowel cancer research currently doesn't reflect the burden of disease accurately in this country,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

He stated that while bowel cancer accounts for around 13 percent of all cancer diagnosis, research funding has typically not reflected the burden of disease, receiving between 7 and 10 percent of NHMRC funding for cancer research and treatment.

While there are other government, not-for-profit and commercial groups engaged in bowel cancer research, Mr Wiggins pointed to CSIRO's involvement in developing a blood test for bowel cancer that is currently being piloted in the Blue Mountains for people who cannot or will not carry out screening with the recommended stool test.

'It's really a sad day for bowel cancer.'

The areas of CSIRO that will suffer job cuts have not been fully announced, but are set to include 40 jobs across both the colorectal cancer and neurosciences research areas, and eight full-time researchers from Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) in Geelong who investigate bio-security threats to humans that can be transmitted from animals. 

Mr Popovski said the morale at CSIRO is 'very despondent'.

'These latest cuts to CSIRO are particularly illogical and short-sighted,' he said. 'We want to make people making these decisions accountable.'
