A judge has credited a knife-wielding thug for 'taking care not to inflict life threatening injuries' when he stabbed his victim five times in a nightclub attack.

Hoopang Wong, 25, who has two previous convictions for possessing a knife, stabbed Karlos Fredericks three times in his right thigh, once in his left thigh and once in his left armpit.

Recorder Michael Hunter, sitting at Kingston Crown Court, sentenced Wong to seven years in jail for wounding with intent.

He told him he would be 'failing to protect the public' if he did not pass a substantial custodial sentence, but gave him credit for using the knife in the way he did.

He said: 'I take into account four of the wounds and two of the deep wounds were deliberately made by you on the legs.

'I am therefore giving you credit for the fact that when you used the knife the way you did you were taking care not to inflict life threatening injuries, although I am aware that such injuries can cause death.

'I can only hope that when you are released from prison you will use your potential and never return to prison again.'

The court heard the victim had surgery and stitches above his left eyebrow and has ongoing issues with feeling and movement in his legs.

Wong attacked his victim with a flick knife on May 20 this year at the Oceana nightclub in Clarence Street, Kingston, Surrey.

He claimed during his trial that Mr Fredericks had attacked him, and after finding the blade on the floor of the club, he accidentally cut the victim in self defence.

Mr Fredericks received four cuts to his legs, including one down to the bone, and a fifth to the chest.

Wong was found guilty of the stabbing on November 12.

On Tuesday Mr Hunter told Wong: 'I would be failing to protect the public if I did not pass upon you a substantial custodial sentence.'

The judge accepted that Wong had not intended to kill Mr Fredericks as the majority of injuries were to the legs.

But
he also pointed to the fact Wong, from Northolt in Middlesex, had two 
previous convictions for possessing a knife, serving an eight week 
prison sentence for the second offence in 2007.

Mr Hunter said: 'I have to take into account the fact that you have previous convictions for possession of a rather similar knife, and I'm sure you would have been warned in the past if you were to use such a knife again.

Defending Wong, Nathalie Carter 
described her client as a 'warm, loyal and sensitive young man,' with 
aspirations of becoming a tattoo artist.

She also submitted letters to Mr Hunter, written by Wong and members of his family.

Mr Hunter said: 'I have read your very well constructed letter, and I take into account your expressions of remorse.

'But I could have given you much more credit if you had pleaded guilty and not blamed the victim.

'You have robbed me of the opportunity of giving you a greater discount.'

The femoral artery, pictured right, is a large artery in the thigh which runs through the groin and supplies blood to the legs.

Due to the need for it to supply blood to the muscles of the legs it is one of the largest arteries in the body and often has the highest blood pressure.

It is particularly vulnerable due to how close it is to the surface of the skin and, if punctured, the victim can bleed to death in a matter of minutes.

The axillary artery meanwhile is a large blood vessel which conveys blood to the armpit, the thorax and the upper limb.

If the axillary artery is cut, a person can bleed to death in one minute or less.
