A football coach who made an ignorant statement during a recent interview got the ultimate payback at a news conference this week.

Cincinnati Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis was appearing on a local Cincinnati radio station earlier this week when he referred to Cleveland Browns quarterback Johnny Manziel as a 'midget.'

And while the rookie footballer, who claims to be 6'0" said he had no problem with Lewis' comment, even calling the comment 'funny,' a Cleveland news station found the perfect way to make Lewis acknowledge his statement - by sending a little person to interview him.

Not nice: In an interview with a Cincinnati radio station, Lewis called Manziel (above) a 'midget'

Payback: One Cleveland news station decided to respond to the controversy by sending a little person, Lil' John Rinaldi (above) to interview Lewis on Wednesday

Lil’ John Rinaldi turned up to Wednesday's news conference armed with a number of questions for Fox 8 having to do with Manziel's height.

Before he could start asking them though, Lewis did take a moment to apologize for his 'midget' comment.

'It was thoughtless on my part to use the word I did, and not excusable, and I greatly regret it,' he told the assembled reporters. 

Then Rinaldi got to his first question for Lewis; 'Based on the height difference of a play like Manziel how has your defensive approach changed for Sunday’s game?'

This was a reference to the fact that Manziel is a few inches shorter than Brian Hoyer, the Browns normal starter, who he is replacing in Sunday's game.

Lewis, undaunted, gave the question a long and thorough response.

Not bothered: Rinaldi (above in blue in a photo posted by Mark Slaughter on Twitter) said he was not offended by Lewis' comment

Rinaldi then asked; 'Hoyer likes to stand tall in the pocket and Manziel likes to move around. What challenges does that present to your defense?'

Lewis again had a nice long response.

For his part, Rinaldi said he took no offense with Lewis' comment, and feels the coach has apologized enough.

Manziel will have a shot at getting the last word however when his Browns take on Lewis' Bengals this Sunday in Cleveland.
