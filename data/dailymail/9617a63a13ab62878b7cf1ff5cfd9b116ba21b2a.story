Riot police arrested more demonstrators overnight in Ferguson as tensions simmer ahead of a grand jury decision
in the case of a white officer who shot dead an unarmed black
teenager in August.

The grand jury is deciding whether to charge officer Darren
Wilson in the slaying of 18-year-old Michael Brown in the St.
Louis suburb.

About a dozen protesters gathered again outside the police
station in Ferguson in frigid conditions, sometimes blocking
vehicles as they waved placards and chanted 'Whose streets? Our
streets!' and 'Killer cops have got to go!'

Police did not confirm an official tally. The Chicago Tribune reported at least six were arrested. 

The grand jury could continue meeting into January but a
decision on the Brown case is expected by the end of November.

The August 9 killing of Brown triggered weeks of sometimes
violent protests demanding Wilson be indicted. 

Last night Michael Brown Sr. released a public service announcement appealing for calm and non-violence among those who might protest, saying that 'hurting others is not the answer.''

'No matter what the grand jury decides, I do not want my son’s death to be in vain,' said Brown.

'I want it to lead to incredible change, positive change, change that makes the St. Louis region better for everyone. 

Brown made it clear however, that there is still more work to be done.

'Continue to lift your voices with us and lets work together to heal and to create lasting change for all people regardless of race,' he says. 

He also thanked many of the protesters for 'lifting [their] voices to end racial profiling and police intimidation.

if the grand jury decides not to bring charges against Wilson.

Missouri Governor Jay Nixon has declared a state of
emergency and called in 400 National Guard troops to back up
police.

Critics have called that a heavy-handed response, saying
the majority of demonstrations have been peaceful 

Activists across the United States said they would stage
their own rallies at federal courthouses nationwide regardless
of the grand jury's decision. 

They say they will call for
federal charges to be brought against Wilson if he does not face
state charges.

Cathy Daniels, a hospital worker and activist known to the
protesters as 'Momma Cat,' watched Thursday night's rally.

'My young people, I love them so much,' she said. 

'They
thought we'd go away when it got cold, but look. ... This is
just the start.' 

On Thursday it emerged Wilson has said he feels 'confident' he won't be charged by the grand jury and is working with city officials to negotiate his resignation from the Ferguson Police Department.

Jeff Roorda, business manager for the St. Louis Police Officers' Association, said he met with  Wilson, who has remained secluded from the public eye since the shooting.

'It's fair to say that neither he nor his defense team expect an indictment,' Roorda said.

There are reports that a militant group is offering a cash reward for anyone who can give them the location of Willson.

A group describing itself as a 'Militant Resistance' to a 'corrupt police state' has offered $5000 for details of Ferguson police officer's whereabouts.

Brown was shot by Wilson on August 9 in Ferguson.

Wilson allegedly claimed, according to his grand jury testimony which was leaked to the public, that he saw Brown and his friend Don Johnson walking down the middle of the road that day, and thought Brown matched the description of a young man involved in a recent robbery.

When he tried to stop the boys, he said Brown punched him through the window.

Wilson claims he then drew his weapon but Brown tried to wrestle it from him while continuing to punch him in the face.

During that struggle for his gun, Wilson said he got off two shots, missing the Brown on the first and hitting him in the hand with the second.

When Brown tried to escape, Wilson allegedly stated that he continued to shoot, firing off the fatal volley of shots when Brown turned and started rushing towards him.

This account is in contrast with that of several eyewitnesses, and Brown's companion Johnson, who claimed that the unarmed teen had his hands up, or by his side, and begged the officer 'Stop shooting.'

The office of St Louis Prosecutor Bob McCulloch has said that they will unseal all evidence reviewed by the Grand Jury following their decision and release it to the public.
