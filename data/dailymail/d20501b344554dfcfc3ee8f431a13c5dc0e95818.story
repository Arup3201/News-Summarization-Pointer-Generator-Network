The pistol that Harrison Ford's character Han Solo used in Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back and The Return of the Jedi is being sold.

The so-called DL-44 Blaster - which Ford used in the two 1980s blockbuster movies - is estimated to be sold for between $200,000 to $300,000 when it goes up for auction.

It is being sold by a memorabilia collector, and is still in its original condition, only showing signs of wear from its use.

Using the force: Harrison Ford holding the DL-44 Blaster from Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back & Return of the Jedi

Auction: The gun is expected to sell for between $100,000 - $200,000

Weapon: The pistol is in its original condition and only shows signs of wear from its use

It's the same prop Darth Vader lassoed 
out of Solo's hand and the one which Ford wrestled back from a 
Stormtrooper, said online auctioneeers Invaluable on their website.

They said: 'The blaster is exactly in its original filming condition and therefore exhibits wear from use, but retains all of the original details, including the flash suppressor and scope.'

Its vintage boxy design was inspired by the Mauser C96, a German pistol made in large numbers from 1896 to 1937.

The item is open for bidding alongside other pistols and guns used by Ford in Blade Runner and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
