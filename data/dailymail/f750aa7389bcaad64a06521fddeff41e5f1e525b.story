Australia are mounting an audacious bid to lure the Lions back for a one-off match in 2017, prior to the tourists' arrival in New Zealand.

The British and Irish team completed a full tour Down Under just a year ago - culminating in an epic 2-1 Test series triumph. Ordinarily, they would not return to Australia for another 12 years, in 2025, but the ARU are attempting to accelerate their next visit.

Last year's tour featured a warm-up match against the Barbarians in Hong Kong as a stop-off on the journey south.

The Lions are thought to be considering a similar fixture in 2017 and the Australians have made contact to raise the possibility of that game taking place on their shores.

ARU chief executive, Bill Pulver, said: 'That's one of the conversations we've been having with them (Lions officials). If they want preliminary games outside New Zealand then we would be a wonderful location for them. We would take it in a heartbeat.'

While the prospect of a match between the Lions and the Wallabies is unlikely in the midst of a Super Rugby season, alternative options are being discussed.

The ARU would be desperate to land the fixture as a source of considerable revenue, at a time when they are struggling both financially and in terms of public support. 

Last weekend, a meagre crowd of 15,000 attended the Test between Australia and Argentina on the Gold Coast. The lack of June tours next year, ahead of the World Cup, will cause further monetary problems.

The Lions were heavily criticised for their stop-off in Asia last year, when players had to contend with extreme levels of humidity to fulfil a fixture which was widely seen as being a commercial exercise to satisfy sponsors HSBC - who are based in Hong Kong.

It also reflected a lack of suitable opposition in Australia, whereas New Zealand could provide a greater spread of meaningful warm-up matches.

In 2005, the tour to New Zealand was preceded by a game against Argentina in Cardiff designed to raise funds to pay for the trip.
