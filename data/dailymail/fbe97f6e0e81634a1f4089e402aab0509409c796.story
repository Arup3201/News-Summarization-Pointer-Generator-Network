Nelson Mandela has been discharged from hospital despite his 'critical and unstable' condition

Anti-apartheid leader and former South African President Nelson Mandela was discharged from hospital and returned home on Sunday after being treated for a recurring lung infection.

President Jacob Zuma's office said the government would like to wish Mr Mandela "all the best" as he continues his recovery at his Johannesburg home.

In a statement, the government said: "Madiba's condition remains critical and is at times unstable.

'Nevertheless, his team of doctors are convinced that he will receive the same level of intensive care at his Houghton home that he received in Pretoria.

'His home has been reconfigured to allow him to receive intensive care there. The health care personnel providing care at his home are the very same who provided care to him in hospital.

'If there are health conditions that warrant another admission to hospital in future, this will be done.'

His condition has 
fluctuated since he was admitted to hospital in June with a lung 
infection.

The illness is said to date back to his days in prison during his anti-apartheid campaign.

His family have been hoping that his health 
would improve sufficiently for him to return to  his specially adapted 
home in Johannesburg.

Around the time of his birthday in 
July, it was widely feared that Mandela was close to death.
