Women who use a contraceptive jab are at greater risk of contracting HIV, new research suggests. 

A study found the jab increases a woman’s chance of becoming infected with HIV by 40 per cent compared with women using other contraceptive methods or no method. 

The injected contraceptive is known as depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), commonly known as Depo-Provera or the birth control shot.

The study, published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, involved a review of 12 studies of more than 39,500 women.

It found other forms of hormonal contraception, including oral contraceptive pills, do not appear to increase this risk.

However, researchers stressed that although statistically significant, the figure represents only a moderate increase in relative risk.

And the risk appeared to be lower among women in the general population which saw the risk increase by 31 per cent than for women already at high risk of acquiring HIV, such as prostitutes. 

Worldwide about 144 million women use hormonal contraception - around 41 million use the injectable forms and 103 million take the oral contraceptive pill.

Whether or not use of hormonal contraceptives increases women's risk of HIV acquisition has been hotly debated for more than two decades, but the research so far has been inconclusive.

However the researchers, from the University of California at Berkeley, said their findings did not warrant the injection being withdrawn.

Epidemiologist Lauren Ralph said: The moderate elevation in risk observed in our study is not enough to justify a complete withdrawal of DMPA for women in the general population.

'Banning DMPA would leave many women without immediate access to alternative, effective contraceptive options.

'This is likely to lead to more unintended pregnancies, and because childbirth remains life-threatening in many developing countries, could increase overall deaths among women.' 

Ms Ralph told MailOnline there are a number of reasons why the contraceptive injection may have this effect.

‘In short, both biologic and behavioral mechanisms have been proposed to explain the relationship between Depo (and other progestin-based contraceptives) and risk of HIV.

But other forms of hormonal contraception, including The Pill, did not appear to increase the risk of HIV 

‘On the behavioural side, women who use hormonal contraceptive methods are different than those that do not, and these differences might also be related to their risk of HIV.

For example, some evidence indicates that women using hormonal contraception use condoms less often.

These differences, if not properly adjusted for in analyses, would bias estimates of the hormonal contraception-HIV relationship.'

However this study had only looked at research that had adjusted for condom use.

She added that lab studies had suggested the use of hormonal contraceptives might have a number of effects on the body.

‘These include ioncluding inducing structural changes to the genital tract, altering immune responses, and changing vaginal flora, that might increase women’s susceptibility to HIV.

‘However, the exact mechanisms remain unclear. I’d like to emphasize though that our study did not examine the physiological effects of the different contraceptive methods - and more research on the potential underlying biologic mechanisms is needed.’
