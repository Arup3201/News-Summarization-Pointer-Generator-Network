Her estranged husband Kris Humphries may not have turned up in court to attend their mandatory divorce settlement conference on Friday.

But Kim Kardashian certainly made her presence known.

The 32-year-old pregnant star was escorted out of a LA court house flanked by not one, but ten uniformed Los Angeles County sheriffs.

Walking directly in the middle of the group of men, the reality star made sure she had the utmost protection as she made her way to a chauffeured car.

Kim wore her most demure maternity-style outfit yet for the court hearing.

Gone were the low-cut tops, tight dresses and leather trousers, and instead Kim opted for a decidedly conservative look.

The reality star slipped on a grey patterned jacket, which was buttoned all the way up to her neck and billowed out at the waist into a somewhat baby doll style.

Kim wore the dress over a pair of white trousers and accessorised with demure black stilettos.

Scraping her hair back into a tight ponytail, her features looked stronger than ever and she highlighted her famous pout with lashings of red lipstick.

court

The usually smiling star stared straight ahead and put on a pout.

It appears as though Kim came out as the winner in her first round battle with estranged husband Kris.

The pro-NBA player had been intent on taking his ex-wife to the cleaners in their divorce case, but he seemingly dropped the ball after not showing up to court on Friday.

While Los Angeles-based Kim arrived punctually for the hearing, Kris was still in New York.

A source told TMZ that the basketballer was spotted in the Big Apple at 1am on Friday morning.

The insider says that Kim's former husband of just 72 days, looked 'visibly upset'.

The
settlement conference was scheduled for 8.30am, but the only New York 
to Los Angeles bound flight on Friday morning was 6.30am, arriving in at
LAX at  9.15am.

That would mean that Kris would have been late for the hearing anyway.

According to TMZ, while
the court was told that Kris was detained in New York, Judge Goldberg, 
who was presiding over the case, was unimpressed and set a sanction 
hearing, which means Kris could face fines for not turning up.

During the court hearing, Kim reportedly sat in the jury box, her hands crossed on her lap as the case was called.

A judge sealed the proceedings, citing rules mandating confidentiality for divorce settlement discussions.

Attorneys did not reach a settlement. Humphries' attorneys declined to comment on settlement discussions but said a May 6 trial date remains.

While Kris, who is seeking an 
annulment based on his claim the pair's 72-day marriage was fraudulent, 
did not appear in court, he was represented by three attorneys.

Kim arrived once again under heavy security and was brought into the courtroom 
through a back entrance.

She 
kept her hands crossed on her lap while she listened to Judge Goldberg explain to reporters that the hearing would be closed.

'I always wanted to be a juror,' she joked to deputies before taking her seat.

Kim and Kris are both 
expected to testify at the trial, which will focus on their relationship
and whether elements of it were staged for the show Keeping Up With 
the Kardashians.

The Brooklyn Nets power forward has 
not yet laid out his specifics to support his fraud claim.

He claims the
marriage should be annulled because Kim only married him because
of her reality show.

Kim is expecting her first child with 
boyfriend Kanye West later this year.

For her court date, she was not accompanied by her famous sisters or Kanye to 
court.

No-show: Kim's estranged husband Kris Humphries was a no-show at the court hearing on Friday

Kourtney Kardashian and Khloe 
Kardashian are not on their sister's proposed witness list, but their 
mother, Kris Jenner, will likely testify about the pair's relationship.

Kris has not yet filed his witness list for the trial, which is 
expected to last a week.

Kris's no show comes after sources 
told Radaronline that the NBA player, who claims he was tricked into 
marrying Kim for the sake of her hit reality show, was eager to face his
estranged wife in court.

'Kris has been absolutely trashed by the Kardashians in the press,' the source said.

'He has taken the high road and never spoken negatively about Kim, or her family, despite the hell they have put him through.'

The
pro-baller wants the former couple's 72-day marriage annulled, while 
Kim, who denies duping Kris, wants a divorce to be granted.

Kim and Kris's divorce case is certainly heating up, and it was recently revealed that Kris is desperately trying to get Kim to admit under oath that scenes for her reality show Keeping Up With The Kardashians were staged to make him look bad.

A witness list in the case include several producers and television executives who are testifying in the case.

Jay Russell, a producer on the show, has already said to have been grilled in one deposition.

According to Radaronline.com, he admitted that one episode of the show, featuring Kris, was 'scripted, reshot or edited'.

According to Russell, the scene was was intended to paint Kris as a 'villain'.

Another particular scene of the E! reality show will also be picked apart.

It is the moment when Kim tells her mother and manager Kris Jenner that she wanted a divorce from Kris whilst the pair are on a business trip to Dubai.

It has since been revealed that the particular plot line was filmed after Kim and Kris's divorce was confirmed and was shot in a Los Angeles studio.

Kris is also set to take the stand where he will be questioned about the show's legitimacy, according to a Radaronline source.

'Kim is freaking out that she is going to be forced to testify that aspects of the Kardashian reality show are fake,' the insider said.

'Kim has always said how much she loves her fans and viewers. Kris feels that this proves unequivocally he was duped into marrying Kim.'

The divorce trial is scheduled to begin on May 6.
