A decomposing body believed to be a missing 28-year-old woman was found on Tuesday just hours before her ex-boyfriend stabbed himself to death.

Tanya Gonzalez, who worked at the Mojito Bar in Miami, Florida, vanished on September 9 and a manhunt launched for her ex Roy Ruz Blanco, who is believed to have abused her during their five-year relationship.

On Tuesday, police discovered a badly decomposed body inside Blanco's BMW which had been abandoned several days ago in Flagami, a residential neighborhood of Miami.

Police investigate an abandoned BMW on Tuesday after a body was found in the trunk. The medical examiner was confirming whether it was Miss Gonzalez who vanished last week

Investigators in hazmat suits removed the body. The medical examiner is currently working to determine whether the body is that of the 28-year-old bartender, Miami police told MailOnline today. 

A short time later, Miami police learned that Blanco, 33, had stabbed himself to death with a steak knife while sheriff deputies were in pursuit in the Florida Keys. 

He stabbed himself in the stomach while his mother Marta Blanco-Mendoza swallowed pills during the chase through the woods. 

Blanco, 33, died at 4pm on Tuesday at a medical center while his mother remains in hospital. Their Siberian husky was handed over to an animal shelter.

Miami Police were investigating at Blanco's home, police told MailOnline today, which he shared with his mother.  

The suspect had disappeared last week with his mother and dog on a boat to the Keys, the Miami Herald reported. Police questioned him on a boat this weekend but later let him go.  

Miami Police Detective Frederica Burden told the Herald: 'No one can even script a movie like this. It’s crazy.' 

The deaths are believed to be a murder-suicide, according to investigators.  

Blanco, who was 6'4' and weighed more than 200lb, was in a five-year relationship with Miss Gonzalez, relatives said, and it was believed that he abused her. 

She lived in fear, family told the Miami Herald, but finally left Blanco and moved into her own apartment but never pressed charges against him.  

Authorities are working to discover if a decomposing body found in the trunk of an abandoned car is missing bartender Tanya Gonzalez
