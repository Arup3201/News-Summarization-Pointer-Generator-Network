Others including Gavin and Stacey star James Corden, a close friend of Becks, and Boyzone singer Ronan Keating, branded the snub 'disrespectful' to 'one of the greatest ambassadors for the game'.

Many Twitter users have also been posting messages of support using the hashtag #pickbecks.

Snubbed: David Beckham, pictured bringing the Olympic torch to Britain from Greece this year, has revealed he is 'very disappointed' to have been left out of the Team GB 2012 football squad

Disappointment: Last month Becks lit the flame seven years after he fought so hard with others to bring the Olympics to London

England's record joint top scorer Gary 
Lineker tweeted: 'Terrible shame for Beckham having given so much to the
Olympic bid and football.

'Never thought for a second that David 
Beckham would be excluded from GB’s team. What I don’t understand is stringing him along by including him in a short list?'

Despite his age, 37-year-old Beckham had 
hoped his efforts to bring the Games to his native east London would get
him into manager Stuart Pearce's side. But is dream has been cruelly taken away.

And there has been huge uproar since it was announced today. 

Back to the day job: Beckham appeared to take the snub in his stride when he was pictured today training with his club side LA Galaxy in California

His pal James Corden, who got to know him through Comic Relief, said: 'To ask David Beckham to give everything to winning the Olympics for 
London and then not picking him to take part is so disrespectful.'

Ronan Keating tweeted: 'Don't understand why David Beckham was not picked for Olympic team. One of the greatest ambassadors for the game. And still totally capable.'

Former Deputy prime Minister John Prescott also said: 'David Beckham deserves to be in Team GB. Played a crucial part in the bid & least he'd be good at penalties!'

Beckham has been widely credited with helping win the Games for London in 2005 and has been involved ever since.

Only last month icon he flew in from Los Angeles to light the Olympic torch when it landed in Cornwall from Greece, marking the flame's arrival on UK soil.

1975: Born Leytonstone, east London.

1991: Joins Manchester United as trainee.

1996: Helps United to Premier League and FA Cup double.

1999: Helps United win the Premier League, FA Cup and European Cup

2000: Collects fourth championship winner`s medal as United win title by a record 18 points.

2003: Awarded an OBE, above right, in the Queen's Birthday Honours for services to football. Joins Real Madrid for £25million.

2005: Captains England for 50th time and helps win Olympics for London in Singapore.

2008: Wins 100th cap in the friendly against France.

2010: Part of England's backroom staff for World Cup.

2011: Wins the MLS Cup with LA Galaxy.

2012: Announces he has not been included in Team GB's squad for the Olympic Games.

He was also a key part of the delegation that travelled to Singapore in 2005 and won the Games. The rival Paris bid had been expected to win but in an amazing turnaround London beat them.

He also represented Britain at the closing ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics by kicking a golden football.

Beckham, who has more than 100 England caps and is seen as one of the country's greatest ever players, had 
seemed to be certain to be part of the summer event but Micah Richards, 
Craig Bellamy and Ryan Giggs have been picked as the over-23 players.

Beckham said today: 'Everyone knows 
how much playing for my country has always meant to me. So I would have 
been honoured to have been part of this unique Team GB squad.'

He
added: 'Naturally I am very disappointed, but there will be no bigger 
supporter of the team than me. And like everyone, I will be hoping they 
can win the gold.

'As a 
Londoner, I will have been really proud to have played a small part in 
bringing the Olympics to my home town as part of Seb's [Coe] team, and I
can't wait for the games to begin and enjoy every moment along with the
rest of Great Britain.'

The celebrated midfielder is also a proud Londoner, so the snub is a double blow.

Whenever he's in the capital, Beckham always makes the effort to visit a restaurant for his favourite meal, pie and mash, 
having been a fan of the traditional English meal since childhood.

In fact, Beckham 
paid for a delivery of pie and mash for all the Tottenham Hotspurs 
players when he finished training at White Hart Lane last year.

He had trained with Spurs during the 
US close season in order to try to play for England again after he was 
dropped by Fabio Capello.

Yet Pearce called dedicated Beckham onWednesday night
to inform him of the decision to leave him out, explaining that he had enough 
midfield players and he wanted to add experience to his defence.

The
37-year-old superstar, who currently plies his trade for MLS side LA 
Galaxy, played a massive role in Britain securing the Games seven years 
ago, and has stayed involved in a huge capacity since.

Watching: Stuart Pearce went to see Beckham in action before he made his decision and told him he was not making London 2012

Beckham was included in Pearce's 35-man shortlist for the Games but will now not made the final cut.

Terrible shame for Beckham having given so much to to the Olympic bid and football.

Never thought for a second that David Beckham would be excluded from GB's team.

Their are arguments for and against DB selection. What i don't 
understand though, is why string him along by including him in a short 
list? 

James Corden ‏@JKCorden

To ask David Beckham to give 
everything to winning the Olympics for London and then not picking him 
to take part is so disrespectful.

Ronan Keating ‏@ronanofficial

Don't understand why David Beckham 
was not picked for Olympic team. One of the greatest ambassadors for the
game. And still totally capable

Lee Westwood ‏@WestwoodLee

I'm amazed David Beckham didn't get picked for the Olympic football team!

John Prescott ‏@johnprescott

David Beckham deserves to be in Team GB. Played a crucial part in the bid & least he'd be good at penalties!

Piers Morgan ‏@piersmorgan

Relax everyone - #Beckham can still go the Olympics. He just has to buy a ticket like the rest of us.

As a football's biggest star, Beckham would 
have been a big pull for fans to come and watch Team GB at the games and
get excited about the Olympic football - which is not normally a major draw for spectators.

He is still expected to come to the Games in some aspect and may have a role to play at the opening ceremony.

Former footballers today expressed their anger at the decision.

Former Welsh midfielder Robbie Savage said: 'Why was beckham on the shortlist in the first place, then not to pick him ! Disgrace ! Stuart Pearce does make some stupid decisions , ie Parker captain of England and no beckham in gb Team , clueless!'

Bookmaker Ladbrokes has now slashed the odds on Beckham being given the honor of lighting the Olympic flame at the July 27 opening ceremony, making him 5-1.

Five-time rowing gold medalist Steve Redgrave is the 1-2 favorite.

The British Olympic Association will also be surprised by the decision to leave Beckham out.

But BOA chief Andy Hunt had previously said Pearce will have free reign to do as he pleases with the squad.

He
said: 'Stuart Pearce will make a decision on the best squad available 
given where he is in respect of now having assessed the players that are
not involved in the Euros and the current state of injuries. 

'He
will then make the best call he can - on merit. I am not putting any 
pressure of him whatsoever to pick anyone.

'We discussed the whole topic 
of selecting over-23 players back more than a year ago but I haven't 
subsequently.

Delight: Beckham and his wife Victoria (left) leave the London 2012 celebration party after London won the Games in 2005

Effort: London 2012 sport ambassadors (from left) Beckham Sir Steven Redgrave and Denise Lewis

Curtain call: Beckham even represented Britain at the Beijing closing ceremony from a high platform in the stadium

Family man: David, with his wife Victoria and his three boys, had dreamt of being involved in the Games

'We have been very clear from the outset, it's absolutely Stuart's choice and he is totally free to make the selection of the team he believes will put in the best performance. It's as simple as that.'

As a global superstar Beckham would have been a big pull for fans to come and watch Team GB at the games and get excited about the Olympic football - which is not normally a major pull.

Beckham is still expected to come to the Games in some aspect and may have a role to play at the opening ceremony.
