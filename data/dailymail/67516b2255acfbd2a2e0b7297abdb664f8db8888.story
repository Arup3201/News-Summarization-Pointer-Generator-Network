Leicester’s 5-3 victory over Manchester United may have been the high point of their Premier League season so far, but Nigel Pearson insists he has tried hard to forget all about it.

The Leicester manager has not wanted his players to dwell on that stunning victory, rescued after falling 3-1 behind, which saw a winless run of 13 games follow subsequently.

That prompted questions about the adverse effect of winning in such style and Pearson would rather the match was never mentioned.

It was a day to forget for United boss Louis van Gaal after they conceded five goals at the King Power

‘We’ve been trying to forget about it ever since,’ he said. ‘It was great but until we won at Hull that was the last time we won.

‘I think the best thing for us to do is concentrate on what we are doing at the moment. I don’t know if it has affected anything. It obviously has as the question has been asked.

‘The game at our place was a very good result for us, we had a very good second half and scored at vital times. But those are not sort of events that happen every week. I don’t spend much time looking at those angles.’

Van Gaal changed his 4-4-2 diamond system in the weeks after the 5-3 to a more defensively sound 3-5-2 formation.

United fans have chanted for a switch back but last week the Dutch manager claimed 4-4-2 lacked balance and gives him a ‘twitchy a**’. He highlighted that crazy afternoon at the King Power Stadium as his root cause for his concern.

Pearson believes United present awesome opposition whichever way they shape up – but did indicate Van Gaal might have risked his job had he failed to pick up results while toying with tactics. United have lost once in 14 games.

‘I’m expecting to play against a very good team,’ said Pearson. ‘I would hope that whoever we play have a healthy respect for us.

‘I’ve never been in any doubt their manager will play the way he wants to. But it may be a situation where he gets all his players in before he can totally play the way he wants. That happened with us.

‘But his track record as a manager is outstanding and he’s proved many times over the years he is capable of building sides.

‘I can only speak from my own experience but you have to get enough results while you’re going through the building process to keep people on side or keep your job.’
