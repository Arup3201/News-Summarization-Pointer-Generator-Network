Bedfordshire Deputy Commissioner Tafheen Sharif

A Deputy Police Commissioner was forced to quit after attempting to interfere with a murder plot trial, in a bid to stop embarrassing details emerging about a relative’s love life.

Tafheen Sharif, 32, tried to use her position to get a judge to stop her cousin’s name being published as the relative gave evidence about the love triangle that led to her fiance being shot.

Her unauthorised approach could have led to the whole case being abandoned at great cost, prompting police and court officials to step in.

Miss Sharif, who is also a Labour councillor once named Young Councillor of the Year, was told her position was ‘untenable’ and she resigned over the summer. 

But the reason behind her resignation could not be revealed until the trial ended for legal reasons.

Her boss Olly Martins, the Labour Police and Crime Commissioner for Bedfordshire, was under investigation by the police watchdog at the time, after he revealed secret details of a death in custody to his boyfriend.

He only learned last week that he would not be charged over the unauthorised disclosure.

Miss Sharif’s case will add to calls for the unpopular PCCs, introduced at great cost only two years ago, to be scrapped following a series of scandals.

In the latest debacle, Miss Sharif almost derailed a Luton Crown Court trial in order to spare the blushes of her distant cousin Nazeem Dadd, who was at the centre of a love triangle that nearly led to a brutal murder.

Miss Dadd, who like Miss Sharif lives in Luton, had been engaged to accountant Atif Ali, 28. She also had another suitor, Shahzad Mahroof, but her family did not approve of the match. So the jealous Mahroof hired hitman Bernard Pillay to kill Mr Ali in what the judge called a ‘brutal and callous act’.

Mr Ali’s silver Audi was rammed off the road by Pillay in Luton in May 2013. When he got out of his car, Pillay blasted him in the leg with a sawn-off shotgun and although he survived after emergency surgery, he was left with life-changing injuries.

A trial began in July this year but just before Miss Dadd was due in the witness box, Deputy PCC Miss Sharif contacted the court to ask the judge if her cousin could be granted anonymity to spare her embarrassment.

It is thought she did not speak directly to the judge and was told by court clerks that she did not have the power to request a reporting ban.

Although Miss Dadd’s evidence about her tangled relationships was heard, court officials were so worried that Miss Sharif’s approach might lead to the trial collapsing that they told police who in turn contacted the PCC’s office – leading to Miss Sharif’s forced resignation.

Last month Mahroof, 28, and Pillay, 41, of Uxbridge, were found guilty of conspiracy to murder and sentenced to life with minimum terms of 15 and 17 years, respectively. The verdict means Miss Sharif’s intervention can now be made public.

There was no comment last night from Miss Dadd, Mr Ali or Miss Sharif. But a close relation of Mr Ali said: ‘I don’t know why she became involved but most people would do the same.

‘It is unfair that Nazeem had her reputation damaged over something that was not her doing so I totally understand why someone would ask the judge about anonymity.’

At Miss Sharif’s home, several male relatives answered the door and said she was ‘out of the country’. On learning that it was an inquiry from the press, one young man sprinted across the street and tried to pull open the passenger door of Mail on Sunday photographer Craig Hibbert’s car. Failing, he went to the driver’s side and demanded Mr Hibbert get out.

A reporter had his notebook snatched away and only recovered it after a struggle – during which one of the relatives ripped out a page of notes and stuffed them into his own mouth.

Minutes later, six men unsuccessfully tried to stop Mr Hibbert’s car as he drove past.

Mr Martins, Labour Police and Crime Commissioner for Bedfordshire said: ‘I was informed on July 30 by the police and representatives of the court of concerns about Ms Sharif’s conduct in relation to an ongoing trial for attempted murder. I met with her on July 31 and after discussions we concluded that her position was untenable.

‘For sub judice reasons it was not possible to comment on this matter, other than to confirm the resignation, while the trial and any subsequent sentencing were ongoing.

‘This issue has been referred to the appropriate authorities and it would therefore be inappropriate to make any further comment at this stage.’
