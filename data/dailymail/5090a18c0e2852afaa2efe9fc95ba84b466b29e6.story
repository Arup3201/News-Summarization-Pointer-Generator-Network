Visitors to the Missouri State Fair have revealed their disgust over a stunt involving a rodeo clown dressed as President Obama.

At the fair, paid in part by tax dollars, an announcer tried to whip the crowd up into a frenzy, asking who wanted to see President Obama 'run down by a bull'.

The stunt on Saturday has raised fresh concerns about how ridiculing President Obama is nothing more than thinly veiled racism.

Anger: A rodeo clown dressed as Obama has angered visitors to Missouri State Fair

One of the other rodeo clowns wobbled the lips of the Obama mask, and the man wearing it was forced to run after a bull gave chase, according to a man who witnessed the event.

A couple who had taken a foreign exchange student to the fair to show them American life said they left in disgust after seeing the offensive stunt, according to the Kansas City Star.

According to the paper, a Facebook post by Perry Beam said: 'The announcer wanted to know if anyone would like to see Obama run down by a bull. The crowd went wild.'

He added that the announcer repeated the question, getting 'louder each time, whipping the audience into a lather'.

Senator Claire McCaskill called the event shameful and unacceptable, according to CBS St Louis.

'The young Missourians who witnessed this stunt learned exactly the wrong lesson about political discourse - that somehow it’s ever acceptable to, in a public event, disrespect, taunt, and joke about harming the President of our great nation,' Ms McCaskill said.

The Jackson County Democratic Party also issued a statement that called the rodeo 'a show as ugly any you could see.'

'Encouraging physical harm to the President, whatever the party, is not acceptable and should not be tolerated,' the statement read.

Anti-Obama sentiment is high in rural Missouri, where the President lost 60-40 per cent to Mitt Romney in the 2012 election.

Outcry: Many people took to Twitter to condemn the rodeo act

However, the rodeo clown dressed as 
Obama was considered by many to be a joke too far, especially 
considering the fair, which sells itself as being suitable for people of
 all ages, is said to have received about $400,000 from Missouri tax 
payers.

Jeff Mazur, executive director at the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, was one of many people who took to social media to condemn the event.

'I like rodeos, I like funnel cake. I like the MO State Fair. Barely-veiled racism, anti-Americanism and violence fantasies ruin them,' he said on Twiiter.

His comments were backed by several Republicans, including Jeremy LaFaver, who said he would no longer be taking his family to the state fair.

St Louis treasurer Tishaura Jones tweeted on Sunday: 'Racism rears its ugly head at MO State Fair ... the fair needs to do a better job welcoming ALL Missourians.'

According to CBS St Louis, she added: 'Since November 2008, racism has been masked under the guise of "anti-Obama sentiment".'

State Republican Gail McCann Beatty said she was angered and disgusted by 'the blatant racism', adding: 'This is an embarrassment to the People of Missouri.'

Caleb Rowden, another Republican, added on Twitter: 'I don’t agree w/ this Prez on 
many things. But he is deserving of respect and shouldn’t be the object 
of political stunts. Out of line!'

Boycott: The stunt led to some families and politicians saying they will stop visiting the fair

Several people have taken to the state fair's Facebook page to state their disgust at the rodeo show, saying it was disrespectful and claiming they would boycott the fair next year.

A spokesman for Missouri State Fair told Mail Online:
 'The performance by one of the rodeo clowns at Saturday’s event was 
inappropriate and disrespectful, and does not reflect the opinions or 
standards of the Missouri State Fair.'

Kari Mergen added: 'We strive to be a family friendly event and regret that Saturday’s rodeo badly missed that mark.'
