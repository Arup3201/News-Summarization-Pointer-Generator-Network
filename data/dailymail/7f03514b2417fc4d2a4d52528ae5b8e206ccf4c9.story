Mauricio Pochettino can be excused if he has Barcelona on his mind as he attempts to become the first Tottenham manager to win at Chelsea since Terry Venables, nearly a quarter of a century ago.

Pochettino had been in charge of Espanyol for only a few games in February 2009 when he took his struggling team to the Nou Camp and ended his team’s 27-year winless run in the derby.

‘I don’t know how we did it,’ said the Spurs boss. ‘Espanyol were bottom and Barcelona were top, and all the people were saying Espanyol were dead and had no chance.

Mauricio Pochettino brought his unfancied Espanyol side to the Nou Camp in February 2009 

That Barcelona team contained stars such as Samuel Eto'o (left), Yaya Toure and Lionel Messi 

But two goals from Ivan de la Pena (above) secured a famous victory for Pochettino's men at Barca's home 

‘It was Pep Guardiola’s first year and they had Ronaldinho, Eto’o, Henry, Yaya Toure, Xavi, Iniesta, Abidal and Puyol. We had unbelievable players, too. I remember Ivan de la Pena scored two.

‘It was the third or fourth game I was in charge and I had started to set a different style on the team. The plan was to press high and surprise them. As always, you have to be a little bit lucky, too.

‘It was a special victory and an unbelievable memory. It was very satisfying for me because I had played at Espanyol for 11 years.’

Pochettino, the 15th Spurs boss since Venables, has not found it so easy to impose his high-energy style on the squad he inherited at White Hart Lane and there has been an absence of shock wins.

Spurs have spluttered, especially at home, but have won their last three games with evidence during the 2-1 victory against Everton on Sunday that his message is finally getting through to the players.

Chelsea, however, will provide a different test. Spurs have not won at Stamford Bridge since February 1990 and Jose Mourinho’s team are unbeaten in 20 games in all competitions this season.

They have also kept 11 clean sheets in their last 14 Barclays Premier League home games.

How best to crack this defensive stability will dominate Pochettino’s selection and his greatest puzzle is whether to recall Emmanuel Adebayor at the expense of Harry Kane or Roberto Soldado.

Kane has been in terrific form and clocked more than 13 kilometres during the Everton game, when Soldado scored his first league goal since March.

It would be harsh to axe either man for Adebayor, who was left out after a dismal display at Aston Villa and then reported after international duty with a hamstring problem. When that cleared up, he was out with a virus, but he is fit for selection now.

Pochettino is cautious going into nine games in 30 days, though. ‘You have to analyse the fatigue as we are playing after three days,’ he said.

‘Sometimes you play with two strikers, as we did against Everton, and you say, “Let’s do the same”, but we need to understand a player may need a rest.’

He believes the Europa League campaign has made it harder for Tottenham to adjust to his demands because the gruelling cycle of travel and games limits training time and has prevented him from operating with a settled team.

‘If you are not ready, not smart to manage the squad, maybe the Europa League kills you,’ said Pochettino, and he claimed the recovery process was simpler if the team were winning every week, like Chelsea. ‘It is much easier to recover because you are happy,’ he said. ‘When you laugh, you recover easily. When you lose four games at home, it is difficult to recover easily because you are sad and you don’t sleep.’

Adebayor's call-up would come at the expense of either Harry Kane (left) or Roberto Soldado 

By that token, Chelsea should be raring to go tonight, but Mourinho insists he will not let the dangling carrot of an unbeaten season disrupt Chelsea’s trophy hunt.

Arsenal went the entire 2003-04 Premier League season without losing — but fell short in the Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup. And Mourinho explained: ‘One thing is, I don’t think it’s possible (to go unbeaten).

‘The other thing is, we are not playing for that because, if you play for that, maybe you draw too many matches, you don’t take risks to try to win matches.

‘You are happy just to be undefeated. If you get 10 draws, you get 10 points. If you win five and lose five, you make 15 points. I’d prefer 15 points. If against Tottenham we have a 0-0 with 20 minutes to go, we are not going to play for the 0-0 to be undefeated. No way.
