The polar bear may be a terrifying predator, but it is hard to feel fear when looking at this little fella playing with his mother.

The fluffy little polar bear cub lived with mother Gerda in Novosibirsk Zoo in Siberia, central Russia.

It is the first-born cub of Gerda and her ‘partner’ Kai, and also the first polar bear to be born at Novosibirsk Zoo in 42 years.

The cub arrived in early December, and
 is now old enough to be able to play outside, albeit under the watchful
 eye of its mother.

The zoo,
 located some 1,750miles east of Moscow, acquired the two adult polar 
bears in 2008, Gerda from a zoo in Moscow and Kai from Leningrad Zoo.

‘Since
 the polar bear is a solitary animal, we occasionally split them up into
 different enclosures.

'It had the desired effect. In November, the 
female started to make itself a ’maternity den’ and lay out a bed of 
hay,’ a Novosibirsk Zoo spokesperson told Sib.fm.

First steps: The polar bear cub was born in December last year and is only just now starting to venture outside

Number one: The cub is not just the first to arrive at the zoo in decades, it is also the firstborn of Gerda and her polar partner Kai

‘In
 early December, she stopped coming out of the shelter. To our great 
joy, Gerda showed herself to be a responsible mother and never showed 
aggression towards the baby.’

Polar
 bear cubs are born between November and February, weighing less than 
2lbs (0.9kg) and remain in the den with their mother for several months 
while nursing.

When they 
exit the den the cubs have grown to eight about 22 to 33lbs (10-15kg) 
after which - in the wild - they stay with their mother until they are 
two-and-a-half years after which she abandons them or, if need be, 
chases them away.
