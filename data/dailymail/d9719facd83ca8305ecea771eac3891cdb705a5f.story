Ollie Locke shot to fame as one of the original Sloanes on Made In Chelsea. The 27-year-old became known and loved for his glossy hair, perma-tan and relationships with both men and women.

After four years, 70 episodes and a fair share of break-ups, Ollie left the show that catapulted him to fame behind. 

He has since penned his debut tome, Laid In Chelsea, which became a best-seller and completed a stint on Big Brother.

New look: Ollie Locke, who found fame on Made In Chelsea, has seen his star rise since leaving the E4 show and now he's hoping to take the male grooming world by storm with his new video tutorials 

Now Ollie, who is currently dating a woman, is preparing to take the male grooming world by storm. His first port of call? Launching an online channel dedicated to all things beauty.

'I have always been passionate about the idea of building my own confidence through the way I can make myself look,' he told MailOnline as he exclusively reveals his debut video. 

'I feel men have always kept very quiet about male grooming, although 90 per cent of us do it in secret, stealing girlfriends' tweezers, moisturisers and concealers. If women can make themselves look better with some help, why can't men?'.

Ollie explains that he plans on taking men on a journey through social media with his male makeover videos on his YouTube channel. These videos, he says, will be showing British men how they can improve their look through some simple techniques. 

'I’m not embarking on creating a country full of Ken lookalikes,' he adds. 'I want to show men how they can make themselves look better in the most simple and easiest ways. 

'Men obviously think it’s girly. If women can indulge in moisturising treatments, why can’t men? I’m trying to bridge that gap to make the men of the world look and feel better.'

As well as treating men to makeovers, Ollie will also be looking at the more extreme side of male grooming. Indeed, he will be the guinea pig and test out Botox, fat-burning treatments and even Kim Kardashian's favoured vampire facial.

Ollie claims that even his male friends in Big Brother were keen to learn about grooming.

He said: 'Even the most unlikely of men were eager to know how to reduce their eye bags and improve their complexion, so I quietly made it a personal challenge to change the way four very different men perceived male grooming.

'By the end I had "showman" Lionel Blair, "bad boy" Dappy, "south London ladies' man" Lee Ryan and even Jim Davidson wearing subtle foundations, using facemasks and leaving all of them asking advice on what and where to buy products outside the house, which made me realise that as a nation the time for male grooming is now.'

Ollie and N-Dubz star Dappy became so close on the reality TV show that Ollie describes him as 'like a brother'.

'We have filmed a show together recently where we did a hilarious five-day fishing challenge, it's out in February on ITV 4,' revealed Ollie.

'Dappy has promised me that he will let me give him a full makeover in a video we would like to call "Make Dappy Dapper"!

'In my eyes, if I can make him wear subtle make-up and have facials, my job is done!'

In his debut video in Ollie Locke's Good Grooming Guide, Ollie, who prides himself on being men's 'beauty and grooming saviour', gives one lucky man a facial along with a step-by-step guide on how to do it at home - and there's plenty more to come.

He added: 'This isn’t about the vain man obsessed with sunbeds, this is about the every man, making them feel happier inside. 

'I want them to look in the mirror and think "I look great". Believe you me, it’s time.'

Speaking about the rapid rise of male grooming and plastic surgery, Dr Yannis Alexandrides, MD at 111 Harley Street, said: 'Across the beauty industry it’s not just cosmetic brands that responded to the demand for grooming products and treatments; plastic surgeons like myself have seen a rapid increase in the number of male patients who are seeking permanent and effective procedures to enhance their image.

'Since I started my practice over 15 years ago, the change in attitude is astounding. Men used to book appointments first thing in the morning or late at night so there was no risk of being faced with a waiting room full of other people; there was a genuine fear of the stigma attached to visiting a plastic surgeon.

'Male patients now visit during peak hours, whether it be on a lunch break for a Botox treatment, or taking an afternoon off for a Fraxel laser session.

'The demand for male non-surgical treatments show defined peaks at certain times during the year, with an influx pre-Christmas and during February bonus season with city workers aiming to impress not only with their career performance but by looking calm and de-stressed. 

'Workers are under tremendous pressure to achieve, and my male patients want lasting results that look natural. A single Botox treatment can last four months while the thought of applying cosmetics each day is daunting.'
