Gaming geeks can get their hands on a piece of history when 800 unearthed copies of the 'world's worst' video game go up for sale on eBay in the coming weeks.

An excavation in New Mexico back in April turned up thousands of copies of E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial that had been buried in a landfill in 1983.

For years, the story that hundreds of thousands of copies of an Atari 2600 game buried in the desert had the air of an urban legend.

Dig it: Archaeologists were joined by filmmakers and fans of the 'world's worst' game as it was unearthed earlier this year in New Mexico

That is, as CBS reports, until a team of archaeologists together with gamers and filmmakers came together at an Alamogordo landfill to dig up what might possibly be the biggest collection of the video game that's beloved for how terrible it is.

The game was developed for Atari to coincide with the theatrical release of Steven Spielberg's now-classic film E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.

But it turned out to be a complete dud, leaving Atari with mountains of copies it kept in a warehouse in El Paso, Texas, in a stockpile of 750,000 unsold titles.

James Heller told KBOI2 that, as an employee for Atari back in 1983, he was responsible for unloading the games, and dumped thousands into a landfill near Roswell, along with six truckloads of cement.

But the games didn't stay buried, as an archaeological dig unearthed thousands of E.T. games in April.

Fuel Entertainment and Xbox Entertainment Studios claimed a couple hundred copies for a documentary they are developing.

Atari: The company was tasked with rolling out a game for Steven Spielberg's cinema classic and turned in a title that couldn't even excite audiences in 1982

Legend: The game lives on, being played for viewers on YouTube, where the game is mocked for frustrating controls, lack of a story and being generally devoid of any interesting gameplay

Other copies are going to museums, including one in Rome.

The rest will be put up for auction by the town of Alamogordo, which owns the landfill. 

What's still to be seen is who would want what was one of the biggest commercial flops of its time is still to be seen. 

'It could be either worth 50 bucks apiece or be worth 5 bucks apiece,; an organizer, Joe Lewandowski, told CBS.
