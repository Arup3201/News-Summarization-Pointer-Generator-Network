Australian batsman Shane Watson and his wife Lee have picked up a lavish four-bedroom property in the affluent eastern suburbs of Sydney.

The cricketer and his sports journalist wife paid $9 million for the luxurious home, which has sweeping views of both Bronte and Tamarama beach.

The four-year-old property was sold before the auction date of November the 1st, with records suggesting it was settled in December for a cool $9 million.

It comes after the Australian international cricketer and his wife sold his last Caringbah South home for $3.9 million last November.

The couple will celebrate five years of marriage in 2015, having tied the knot in 2010 - four years after meeting in 2006

Last month the Watson’s announced they were expecting their second child after two-year-old son Will was born in March 2013. 

And when Lee Furlong stepped out at the 2015 Allan Border Medal Awards in Sydney on Tuesday night, the sports reporter proudly flaunted her growing baby bump.

The expectant WAG proudly showed off her pregnancy figure in a floor-length ruby dress, while husband Shane lovingly looked on and admired his stunning lady love.

Another prominent Australian cricketer to have moved from south Sydney to the eastern suburbs is Michael Clarke , who recently sold his Lilli Pilli home for $2.5 million to upgrade to an $8.5 million home.
