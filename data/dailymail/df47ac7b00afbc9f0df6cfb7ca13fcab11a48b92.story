Reviled: MPs have demanded Fred Goodwin, whose bank had to be saved with billions of taxpayers' money, be stripped of his knighthood after a highly critical report of the FSA

Disgraced banker Sir Fred Goodwin faced growing calls last night to be stripped of his knighthood.

David Cameron is ‘sympathetic’ to cross-party demands for the most reviled figure of the financial crisis to lose the honour bestowed on him for ‘services to banking’. Sir Fred steered the Royal Bank of Scotland to the brink of collapse.

His bank had to be kept afloat with £45billion of taxpayers’ money and is still 83 per cent owned by the state.

Following a highly critical report by the Financial Services Authority, MPs say Sir Fred’s case should now be referred to a secretive Whitehall body responsible for investigating whether honours should be revoked.

Cabinet Secretary Jeremy Heywood is the most senior member of the Forfeiture Committee, which is responsible for ensuring the honours system does not fall into disrepute and can ask the Queen to remove official awards.

Since 1995, it has recommended that 34 people are stripped of their honours, including Zimbawean tyrant Robert Mugabe, former world boxing champion Prince Nazeem Hamed, who was convicted of dangerous driving, and Jean Else, a Manchester headmistress accused of nepotism and mismanagement.

Miss Esle was made a dame for services to education had her honour revoked in February 2011 – two years after being found guilty of misconduct by the General Teaching Council.

She was dismissed following claims of ‘nepotism’ and was found guilty of failing to observe minimum standards in recruiting and promoting staff at Manchester’s Whalley Range High School.

The committee normally considers cases put to it when a holder of an honour has been found guilty of a criminal offence or when they have been censured by a regulator or professional body relevant to the granting of the award.

Other examples of recent forfeitures include a company boss who forfeited his CBE after being disqualified from serving as a director following a Government investigation, a doctor who lost his OBE implicated in a series of deaths at a leading hospital and a man who lose his MBE following a forgery charge.

Most famously, champion jockey Lester Piggott was stripped of his OBE after serving 12 months for a £2.8 million tax fraud in 1987.

The committee is thought to have discussed Sir Fred’s knighthood in 2009, but no action was taken.

MPs say that following the FSA’s report into the RBS, there is now an overwhelming argument that he has been criticised by the relevant regulatory authority and should lose it.

Disgraced: Tyrannical Robert Mugabe and Dame Jean Else, the 'super-head'
schoolteacher who was guilty of misconduct, were stripped of their 
official awards following a recommendation by the panel

Stripped: Boxer Prince Naseem Hamed had his MBE revoked for his driving conviction

The FSA said the former RBS chief 
executive had aggressively expanded the institution over his eight-year 
tenure – culminating in the disastrous acquisition of ABN Amro in 2007.

It found RBS had been brought to its knees by ‘multiple poor decisions’ and its £50billion ‘gamble’ on buying the Dutch bank.

Despite
his key role in the downfall of RBS, Paisley-born Sir Fred continues to
enjoy a gold-plated lifestyle, funded by a £342,500-a-year pension.

The banker also took out a £2.8million tax-free lump sum from his pension before he started receiving it.

He has not been prosecuted or penalised in any way, despite steering the bank to the brink of collapse.

Tory MP Matthew Hancock, who sits on the Commons public accounts committee, and is a close ally of Chancellor George Osborne, said: ‘No-one has ever presided over a bigger corporate disaster that has had implications for every single family in Britain than Fred Goodwin.

‘The knighthood given to him by Gordon Brown is inappropriate for someone who was reckless at the helm of one of Scotland’s oldest institutions.’

Liberal Democrat president Tim Farron 
said: ‘It was completely inappropriate that he had it in the first 
place. He is someone who has damaged the country by his actions.

‘If
it had been through incompetence, we could have lived with it. But it 
was through utter recklessness which cost thousands of people their jobs
and left us to pick up the bill.’

Labour frontbencher Emily Thornberry said: ‘I think honours are supposed to be for people who deserve them, and he doesn’t.’  

Barrage of criticism: Fred Goodwin faced angry protesters and furious shareholders at a meeting in 2008 over the way he and his management team had got the bank into such a weak financial position

Conservative MP Dominic Raab said: 
‘Honours should be reserved for those who serve not stuff the public, so
this is a case the committee should look long and hard at.’

Liberal
Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott, who is close to Business Secretary Vince 
Cable, said: ‘In the light of the FSA report, it is completely untenable
that he should be allowed to keep his knighthood.

‘We
all know the cost of his services to banking. If ever there was a case 
for someone to be stripped of his knighthood, it is Sir Fred Goodwin who
ran RBS into the ground and cost every taxpayer in this country £40 
billion and counting.’

All ears: British Prime Minister David Cameron says he is 'sympathetic' for demands that the banker have his knighthood stripped of him

Jim
Sheridan, the Labour MP for Paisley and Renfrewshire North, said Sir 
Fred should be stripped of his knighthood for ‘causing so much misery 
and damage to industry’.

“I don’t know how anyone can refer to him as ‘sir’,” he said.

“The government needs to demonstrate that people who behave in this way will not be given rewards of any kind.”

Independent Lothian MSP Margo MacDonald added: “The honourable thing for him to do would be to hand it back.

Shadow Cabinet minister Michael Dugher said: ‘It was wrong that Fred Goodwin was knighted. Most of my constituents in Barnsley think it is outrageous he can dine out on being a ‘sir’ and I am inclined to agree with them.’

Tory MP Priti Patel said: ‘Sir Fred Goodwin is utterly discredited, like the party who gave him the honour. He ruined RBS and left the nation to foot the cost. It is right and justified that he should be stripped of his knighthood. The public will welcome this.’

Liberal Democrat MP Lorely Burt, who is chair of the Liberal Democrat backbench business committee, said: ‘A knighthood is an honour bestowed on individuals who are devoted to and give up their time for the public good. If Sir Fred Goodwin is  allowed to hold on to his, it would diminish the value of these honours for all those who truly deserve them.’

 Veteran Labour MP Dennis Skinner said: 
‘Sir Fred Goodwin should be stripped of his knighthood - and not before 
time. He is representative of bankers everywhere who have abused their 
positions for their own ends. I am not a fan of the honours system. It 
is time the whole thing was cleaned up.’

Labour MP Teresa Pearce, a member of 
the Commons Treasury select committee, said: ‘It was an error to give 
him a knighthood. If Fred Goodwin was given his honour for services to 
banking, I’d love to see what a disservice looked like. This man 
collapsed an entire bank and nearly the British economy.’

“He has been so lacking in honour. If he wants to try to make it up to the people he let down and the communities whose standards of probity and care towards each other he stamped on, then one of the things he could do is give the knighthood back.

“A knighthood is supposed to honour probity and all-round generosity of spirit to the community. I don’t think we can say that about him.”

Honour: The prestigious knighthood medal

The FSA report into the collapse of RBS, published late last year, concluded that the bank’s directors – led by Sir Fred and former chairman Sir Tom McKillop – relied for their due diligence during the disastrous takeover of ABN AMRO on two ring-binder folders and a CD.

The report also detailed the strained relationship between the watchdog and Sir Fred before 2005, in particular over RBS’s reluctance to allow its non-executive directors to meet the FSA on an individual one-to-one basis.

‘FSA supervisory records from 2004 suggest that RBS management, and in particular the RBS chief executive, had been resistant to what they saw as unnecessary FSA interference,’ the watchdog said.

The FSA said Sir Fred pushed ahead with the reckless ABN AMRO deal without ‘a sufficient understanding of the risks involved’.

The report said: ‘The decision to make a bid of this scale on the basis of a limited due diligence entailed a degree of risk-taking that can reasonably be criticised as a gamble.

‘Many will find this conclusion [that no director will face sanctions] difficult to accept. Surely someone can and should be held responsible.’

It also said that ‘Sir Fred’s ‘robust and assertive’ management style had been flagged as a potential risk as early as 2003. The banker won his knighthood in 2004.

FSA chairman Lord Turner has admitted taxpayers are ‘absolutely furious’ that Sir Fred could apparently not be punished. Asked if he thought it was fair the banker had got away scot-free he said: ‘No, no I don’t.’
