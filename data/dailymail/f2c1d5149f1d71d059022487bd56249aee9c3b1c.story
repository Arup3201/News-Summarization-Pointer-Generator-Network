Vincent Kompany says he was saddened that England are out of the World Cup but is determined that Belgium will make it into the knock-out stages.

Belgium take on Russia in Rio de Janeiro tomorrow and a win will guarantee a place in the last 16.

Manchester City skipper Kompany has an English wife, Carla, and had hoped Roy Hodgson's side would progress.

Kompany told a news conference: 'My wife is English and although I like to believe my kids are Belgian, she thinks they are English too.

Commiserations: Vincent Kompany was saddened to see England bow out of the competition so quickly

'The [English] players that I have as friends and that I have a lot of respect for meant I wanted them to have a good competition and I'm very saddened as much as the English fans about the exit of England.'

The 28-year-old, who has had treatment for a groin strain last week following the 2-1 win over Algeria, says he is feeling 'good' and relishing the prospect of playing in the Maracana.

He added: 'I have played in a lot of the big stadiums in Europe and the most mythical stadiums in the world are Wembley and Maracana so this is something very special.

'To face off against Russia there will be really special, it was one of my boyhood dreams coming true just to walk on that sacred pitch and it will be very special - and not just for the Belgian players.'

Belgium's first match brought some criticism about a lack of style but Kompany said the players are concentrating only on getting out of the group.

Talent: Romelu Lukaku will be Belgium's main striker in the absence of the injured Christian Benteke

He said: 'We are not going to prove ourselves by style, only results. How have Spain, England, Italy, even Brazil got on? Countries have to focus on getting through the group stage.

'I have come here for one reason and one reason alone, and that's getting great results. We are playing for our country and we are proud to do it.'

Kompany also tried to ease the burden of expectation on Romelu Lukaku, Belgium's main striker in the absence of the injured Christian Benteke, who struggled to impose himself against Algeria.

'He has a tremendous amount of talent but for us it's about not putting pressure on a 21-year-old kid to do it for us at a World Cup, a lot of other people will take the responsibility,' he said.

'He's only 21 so I think he probably has two or more World Cups so there is no pressure on his shoulders. If he performs well for us we will be happy, but the most important thing is he puts his performance for the benefit of the group and he'll be okay.'

Belgium coach Marc Wilmots is expecting a tactical battle against his Russia counterpart Fabio Capello.

He said: 'It could be a very tactical match, Capello has a great track record at some great clubs and we will see what his approach is on the pitch.

'We saw Russia play Korea in quite a rigid formation but we will wait to see against us. The most important thing for us is we have to shut down space.'
