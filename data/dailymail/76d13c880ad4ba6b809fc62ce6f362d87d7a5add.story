Spain and Real Madrid captain Iker Casillas should not be doubted, according to national team-mates Vitolo and Juanmi, because he led the team to glory previously.

Casillas has been capped 160 times for Spain but has been criticised in recent years, particularly after Real's 2-1 defeat by Barcelona at the Nou Camp.

'No one can doubt Casillas,' says Sevilla's Vitolo. 'No one can doubt Casillas. He is the captain of this team that has won a World Cup and two European Championships.

'Maybe your club may be going through bad times, but I do not doubt him.'

Juanmi, another uncapped player called up to the Spain squad, adds: 'Iker is an example.

'He has given a lot to this team. With him there are these titles. He is a 10 as a person and trains at 100 per cent.'
