A rare megamouth shark washed up on a beach dead in the Philippines this week, wildlife officials have said. 

The 15-foot shark, a Megachasma pelagios (giant mouth of the deep), was discovered dead on the beach in Marigondon, Pio Duran, in Albay province. 

It is only the 60th megamouth shark seen in the world, according to marine biologist Christopher Bird.

The Marine Wildlife Watch of the Philippines said the shark is being stored in an ice plant until a necropsy can be performed. 

The shark, nicknamed 'Toothless', was already dead when it washed ashore and the cause of death is unknown. 

It was carried inside by fishermen in a net and preserved in ice by local villagers. 

The Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources in Albay province will investigate to determine the cause of the shark's death. 

In July last year, an 18-foot megamouth was caught by Filipino fishermen.

Most have been found in Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan, but the first confirmed megamouth shark sighting came in 1976, when a deep-sea anchor accidentally caught one near Hawaii.

A megamouth shark can reach to a maximum length of 17 feet and have a life span of up to 100 years, according to Reuters.

The species lives in deep waters but rises towards the surface at night to feed or eat plankton.
