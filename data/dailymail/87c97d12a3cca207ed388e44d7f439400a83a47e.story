David Nalbandian is today facing a police investigation into assault claims after he kicked an advertising hoarding at a line judge and left him with a bloodied shin.

The Argentine star was disqualified from the final of the Queen's Championships yesterday and Scotland Yard said a formal complaint had been made about him.

He has been fined the maximum penalty of £8,000 by the Association of Tennis Professionals  and he will also forfeit his £36,500 in prize money.

Painful: The advertising board crashes into Andrew McDougall's leg, opening a nasty gash

In an outbreak of petulance after missing
a shot, the former world number three, echoing the temper tantrums of 
John McEnroe at his worst, took a savage kick at an ad hoarding.

It flew off its hinges and struck line
judge Andrew McDougall in the shin, causing an inch-long gash from 
which blood started to seep.

Nalbandian, who had won the first set of the final, was disqualified after being deemed 
guilty of unsportsmanlike conduct by the Association of Tennis Professionals.

An ATP spokesman said: “Nalbandian automatically forfeited his prize money and ranking points due to his conduct default.

“A maximum 10,000 euro (£8,000) fine also was issued onsite by the ATP Supervisor for unsportsmanlike conduct.”

Today a spokesman for Scotland Yard 
said: 'We are aware of an incident at the Aegon Championships on June 
17. A complaint has been made and the Metropolitan Police Service is now
investigating.

'The allegation is of assault.'

Nalbandian's Croatian opponent Marin Cilic was declared the tournament winner after the incident.

Despite the incident, Nalbandian said afterwards that he hoped to return to the Wimbledon warm-up event next year.

'This incident doesn't mean that I'm not going to come back,' said the Argentinian.

'It doesn't matter. I really feel good
at this tournament. The tournament director is great to me and I like 
it. This is a bad situation for everybody and I really apologise for 
that but it doesn't mean anything to next year.'

The 6,000-strong crowd sided with 
Nalbandian immediately after the incident, many of them unaware that the
kick had caused such damage to the left leg of Mr McDougall, who needed
treatment for the injury.

Nalbandian, 30, later apologised but insisted he 
should not have been made to default the match.

McEnroe himself was disqualified for 
swearing at an umpire at the 1990 Australian Open and Tim Henman banned 
for hitting a ball at a ballgirl at Wimbledon in 1995.

Nalbandian won the first set on a tie-break but reacted angrily after being broken for the second time in the second set.

Having
just lost the seventh game, the 6ft 7ins Nalbandian fiercely kicked an 
advertising board in front of line judge Andrew McDougall's chair.

As a result of his actions, the ATP rules meant he was disqualified.

Speaking in his post-match interview, Nalbandian, a former world number three, said: 'I am sorry.

'I am sorry to do that. Sometimes we get very frustrated here on court. It is tough to control. It is a mistake.

'It is a tough moment to end a final like that. Sometimes we feel the pressure from the ATP. It is a mistake and I have to pay for that. Everybody makes mistakes.’

Cilic said it 'definitely' wasn't the way he wanted to win the match.

'It was very bitter,' he said.

'The match was set up with David Nalbandian a break down in the second set having won the first but things like that I can't change.

'I'm really sorry to the guys for this.

'To end like this is not easy.

'The match was getting hot and it's tough to see the final finishes like this.'

Winner: Marian Cilic described his win as 'very bitter given the circumstances'

Tournament organiser Chris Kermode said: 'It is just one of those things.

'In sport these things happen.

'It was an unbelievable final, the sun was out and it was shaping up to be the best match of the week.

'David Nalbandian ran across and in frustration kicked the panel out from under the line judge.

'It splintered and cut the linesman's leg, leaving him quite seriously injured.

'Rules are rules.

'The ATP forced us to end the final.

'David is struggling to come to terms with it.

'He is very sorry for what he has done.'

Andrew Castle, commentating for the BBC, said: 'The final was really getting going.

'It was one hour 20 minutes of tennis that was building.

'There will be a hefty old fine for that and, more so, it will be more embarrassing for David Nalbandian.

'You should also think about the line judge who had a nasty old gash.

'It will be mortifying for Nalbandian.

'I don't think for a moment he will blame anyone else but himself.

'This one will go down in history.'
