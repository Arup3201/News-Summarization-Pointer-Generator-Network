Prosecuted: Jose Paulo Da Silveria skateboarded through a Rememberance Day parade dressed as a devil. His presence infuriated a large crowd which had gathered for the event

A man who gatecrashed a Remembrance Sunday parade on a skateboard wearing a pink outfit and horned mask apologised today for any offence he had caused.

Jose Paulo Da Silveria, 38, said he had not intended to disrupt the parade at the Cenotaph in Bristol city centre and had stumbled upon the service accidentally.

Da Silveria was wearing striped tights, pink frilly knickers, a corset and had a red and black face cover when he gatecrashed the event.

His presence infuriated the large crowd which had gathered and led to threats of violence against him.

Speaking today, he said: 'I apologise for the distress but I wasn’t really thinking,' he said.

'I ran into the middle of this thing and I didn’t realise what was going on.

'I was going to College Green and I was just skating along.

'I just came down from Nelson Street and I don’t remember seeing any restrictions and no one was stopping me from carrying on.

'It was only when I saw the photographs in the newspaper that I realised what was going on.'

Outside court Da Silveria, wearing black and blue striped stockings, red shorts, a turquoise corset, blue blouse, white gloves, a lace face mask, hat and makeup, added: 'I didn’t take any notice of what was going on around me.

'I recall people being aggressive towards me when I was arrested.

'I am just so sorry for any offence I caused.'

Da Silveria was speaking outside Bristol Magistrates’ Court after he received a £65 fine and was ordered to pay £85 costs and £20 victims’ surcharge when he pleaded guilty to an offence under the Public Order Act of using threatening words or behaviour to cause harassment, alarm or distress.

For the brief hearing, Da Silveria, from Bristol, had removed his hat and lace mask to sit in the dock of courtroom three.

Prosecutor May Lee told the court that Da Silveria was seen at 11.45am riding his skateboard towards the Cenotaph, where large crowds had gathered to watch the parade.

'He was wearing striped tights, pink frilly knickers, a corset and he had a red and black face cover,' she said.

'He was causing harassment, alarm or distress to the public and there was a strong reaction to his presence.'

John Roberts, defending, said his client had stopped receiving medication for psychiatric problems but since his arrest his treatment had recommenced.

Affront: Horrified onlookers shouted as he disrupted the city's Remembrance Sunday parade

Disgrace: The masked skateboarder, who was wearing pink frilly knickers and corset, was quickly stopped in his tracks by police

'My client apologises unreservedly for any offence he may have caused to anybody,' Mr Roberts said.

'As far as he is concerned it was not any form of protest.

'His care package had come to an end in August and he was not taking any medication.

'He dresses eccentrically and his intention was to go to College Green but he seems to have got into the cordon.

Bizarre: Da Silveria was wearing striped tights, pink frilly knickers, a corset and had a red and black face cover when he gatecrashed the event

'He says he was in a world of his own and he didn’t take in his surroundings and he had caused serious offence to a number of people.

'When he was arrested there were threats of violence towards him.'

Mr Roberts said his client is in receipt of benefits and added: 'His behaviour is being monitored and supported by the caring authorities.'

Tim Jeannes, chairman of the bench, said: 'For this offence we are going to fine you but we have given you credit for your early guilty plea.'
