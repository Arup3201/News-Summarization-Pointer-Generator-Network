Allegations: Paul Napoli, 46, is a partner at Napoli Bern. Court papers filed by his former employee and lover Vanessa Dennis allege he fought to continue seeing the 33-year-old young lawyer even after his wife learned of the 18-month affair and began harrassing Dennis

The former mistress and employee of a partner at a top law firm that made millions representing 9/11 victims has officially filed a defamation against her old employer and his wife.

Vanessa Dennis, 33, was a young lawyer at the firm of Napoli Bern Ripka Shkolnik LLP when she says she had an affair with Napoli that he pursued even after his vindictive wife Marie found out and allegedly began harassing her.

Dennis now wants $11million from her cancer-stricken former flame as she claims in court documents that the 46-year-old tried time and again to bed her even as his wife stalked Dennis and allegedly kidnapped her cat.

The New York Post reports that Dennis recently filed her defamation suit against Napoli, his wife and her former firm Napoli Bern Ripka Shkolnik LLP.

'At Paul’s insistence, Vanessa saw Paul Napoli in his office, had drinks with him,' reads the complaint obtained by the Post. 'On all of these occasions, Paul Napoli tried to have sex with her, but Vanessa refused.'

Napoli, a partner at Napoli Bern which raked in billions of dollars representing diet-pill users and workers at Ground Zero. 

In April 2013, Mrs Napoli, 47, hired a private investigator to spy on her husband and Dennis during a Chicago business trip.

The suit claims she then emailed the young associate, saying, 'I have evidence that is going to be forwarded to your husband if you do not stay away from my husband.'

Mr Napoli demanded Dennis erase correspondence between the pair and admitted he had authorized access for his wife to see both his and Dennis' e-mail accounts, state legal papers.

Court papers say Mrs Napoli messaged Dennis' brother to tell him of the affair and then found Dennis' husband, Richard Buonauito, in Dennis' personnel file as an emergency contact and contacted him.

Dennis was fired from Napoli Bern on May 2, 2013, with a $150,000 severance.

But Mrs Napoli allegedly did not stop the harassment and e-mailed Dennis writing: 'Happy Mothers Day! Oh yea I should say happy motherless day. Tick tock.'

Dennis had previously told Mr Napoli that she might not be able to have conceive.

The Napolis have three young children - including a baby. 

In June 2013 an email included in court papers shows an angry Dennis wrote to Mr Napoli: 'What's more believable Paul — that a 32-year-old junior attorney who weighs 100 pounds soaking wet seduced and physically attacked her 40 something year old boss (who happens to be a managing partner and a millionaire) and twice her size or the other way around.

She emailed him again to remind him of intimate details he had shared about his view of his wife's body since she became a mother.

Dennis, who has since split with her husband, moved to Texas, but she claims Mrs Napoli sent  cards to the wives of Dennis' new bosses, warning them about her and even describing Dennis' private body piercing.

She also sent messages to everyone on LinkedIn associated with Dennis' new firm, Dennis alleges.

Dennis claims that in one day she came out the bathroom of her Houston apartment to find her back door open and her cat missing - she says she received a series of texts written as if from Padme, with one saying, 'How do u think I got out . . .'  

The couple, who have met at St. John’s University School of Law, briefly split up, but are now back together - they live on Long Island

She declined to comment when contacted by the Post and Mr Napoli said he saw nothing wrong 'with confronting a person that there was an affair with.'

'Everything my wife said in any e-mail whether it sounds terrible or not was all true and was all factually correct.'

He denied reports he had previous affairs at the firm and denied that his wife had killed Dennis' cat.

The couple, who have met at St. John’s University School of Law, briefly split up, but are now back together - they live on Long Island.

Last week Mrs Napoli filed her own legal action, claiming Dennis enticed her husband into having sex on the Chicago business trip in violation of the 'Illinois Alienation of Affections Act.'

On his firm's website Mr Napoli's bio reads: ' Paul J. Napoli, a Senior Partner in the firm, has achieved more than 100 verdicts and settlements over one million dollars. 

'He is nationally known as a tenacious and unrelenting advocate for his clients’ rights in courts around the country, where he consistently achieves results in the multiple millions of dollars for injured plaintiffs.

Mr Napoli has been named in New York Super Lawyers® each year since 2007, and in 2010, was named as one of the top 100 lawyers in the New York Metropolitan area.' 

MailOnline has contacted the Napolis for comment.
