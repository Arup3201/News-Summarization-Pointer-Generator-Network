A thick layer of fog blanketed London and the east of England early this morning as the nation's capital appeared to be transformed into a JMW Turner landscape.

As commuters went to work, an early 
morning cloud hung over the River Thames obscuring the city's landmarks 
and reducing visibility to around 15 metres in places.

But London wasn't the only area covered in fog - the shroud stretched from Yorkshire in the north to Kent in the south.

Poor visibility due to fog also caused problems at Heathrow Airport where 63 flights were cancelled. The 31 arrivals and 32 departures were scheduled for between 6am and 11am, a Heathrow spokeswoman said.

There were also severe disruptions at
London City Airport and both airports have advised passengers to check 
with their airlines.

London City posted on its website: 
'Due to low visibility this morning, flights to and from London City 
airport are experiencing disruptions.'

The
Met Office had issued a yellow fog warning covering large parts of the 
country yesterday which was in force until 11am today. The east coast and East Anglia saw the worst of it, while pockets of 
Devon were also affected.

However, forecaster Sarah 
Holland said: 'There has been thick fog and in some places freezing fog,
but this is expected to clear by late morning. It has stretched from 
eastern parts up to Yorkshire, the east Midlands and London and the 
south east.'

She added that the focus for the rest of the week will be on cold and dry weather across the UK.

'It has been very dry for the last few days and that is set to continue for the next few days.

'Temperatures
will drop off after the mild weekend with most areas seeing daytime 
temperatures of 4C to 8C, through to the latter part of the week where 
some areas of the country will see 3C to 4C, which is average or just 
below for the time of the year.'

The
Met Office said today's temperatures will reach up to 8C at the tip of 
Cornwall with around 6C in western coastal areas. Temperatures in the 
east will hover between 1C and 4C.

Temperatures
will hover around freezing across most of the South tonight. While 
winds are expected to reach speeds of 25mph in South Western areas 
making it feel even colder.
