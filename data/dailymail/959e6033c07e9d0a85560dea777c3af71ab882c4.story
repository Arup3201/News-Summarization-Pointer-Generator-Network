While the world's eyes were on Beijing and their precise Olympic games, Chinese agents were pouring over intimate 2008 campaign details of both Barack Obama and his opponent John McCain.

The timely disclosure comes on the eve of the high-profile 'shirt-sleeves' summit between President Obama and his opposite number in China - Xi Jingping and comes in the wake of high profile and public finger pointing by the United States at Beijing to stop their aggressive and pervasive hacking barrage against national security assets.

The Chinese hacking was so brazen that a top McCain foreign policy adviser received a phone call from a senior Chinese diplomat complaining about a supportive letter that McCain had penned to the newly elected president of Taiwan - but not even sent yet.

Tensions between the world's top two economies has been growing slowly over the past decade and Beijing's compelling attacks on American computer networks to steal classified information and high tech weapons designs is pushing Washington to the end of its tether.

'Based on everything I know, this was a case of political cyber-espionage by the Chinese government against the two American political parties,' said Dennis Blair, who served as President Obama’s director of national intelligence in 2009 and 2010 to NBC News.

'They were looking for positions on China, surprises that might be rolled out by campaigns against China.'

The high-tech infiltration of both campaigns networks continued for months and was first detected by the FBI during the summer of 2008 while the Beijing Olympics were being played out.

The fact that Obama's political team had been hacked has been previously acknowledged in May 2009 - but it has never been explicitly stated that China was behind the hack until now.

Indeed, the timing of this confirmation on the eve of the anticipated Californian summit between President Obama and Xi seems part of an American strategy to ramp up the pressure on the communist country to halt its rampant cyber-espionage campaign.

Speaking to NBC News, officials and former campaign team members from both the Obama and McCain camps admit that the security breaches were more serious than previously recognized.

'There’s been successful exfiltration of data from government agencies by the Chinese up and down Pennsylvania Avenue,' said Shawn Henry, who headed up the FBI’s probe of the 2008 attacks as the bureau’s chief of cyber-investigations.

Also speaking to NBC News was David Plouffe, Obama's campaign manager from 2008 - who remembers his phone call from Josh Bolton, then President George W. Bush's chief of staff in August 2008 to alert him to the data theft.

'He said we have reason to believe that your campaign system has been penetrated  by a foreign entity,' Plouffe said in an interview with NBC News.

The Obama campaign discovered that the Chinese hackers had used a simple 'phishing' email that contained a zip file with 'malware' that staffers clicked on and which infiltrated the systems.

However, the virus inside the malware was extraordinarily sophisticated and could have stayed buried for months if not years undetected stealing classified information.

Over at McCain's campaign, Trevor Potter who served as general counsel for the Arizona senator was also briefed by the FBI that hacking was taking place.

'They told us, ‘You've been compromised, your computers are under the control of someone else. You need to get off network’,' said Potter to NBC News.

The most vivid example of the level of open intrusion that the Chinese hackers exhibited was when they appeared to have got access to a private correspondence between McCain and the newly elected president of Taiwan.

On July 25th, 2008, McCain signed a letter, drafted onto campaign computers, which pledged ongoing support for the U.S.-Taiwanese relationship.

However, before the letter was even sent, a senior Chinese diplomat phoned Randall Shriver who was working with McCain to express their displeasure.

'He was putting me on notice that they knew this was going on,' said Shriver to NBC News. 'It certainly struck me as odd that they would be so well-informed.'

A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington said they were too busy to comment because they were working on this weekend's upcoming summit between President Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping in California.

However, contrary to U.S. accusations, Zheng Zeguang, the assistant Chinese foreign minister said that 'China opposes all forms of cyberattacks' in a press Beijing press briefing last week.

Top of Barack Obama's agenda this weekend is cyber-espionage and U.S. officials are said to be sick of it and want it to stop.

A recent report from a U.S. commission chaired by former Intelligence Director Blair and former U.S. Ambassador to China Jon Huntsman Jr., estimated that the theft of intellectual property – mostly from China – was costing the U.S. $300 billion a year.
