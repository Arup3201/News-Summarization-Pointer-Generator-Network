A woman is lucky to be alive after her horse kicked her in the head on two separate occasions, crushing her skull twice.

Claire Hope, 39, lost her eye after her two-year-old horse Archie threw his hoof into the side of her face - smashing her eye socket and cheek bone into six pieces, and causing a brain haemorrhage.

Surgeons told her that her horrendous injuries were similar to those suffered by a bomb blast victim - and had no choice but to remove what remained of her right eye.

Despite her terrible ordeal, Mrs Hope, from Thirsk, north Yorkshire, was determined not to give up on her horses.

Claire Hope (with horses Ollie and Costa) is lucky to be alive after her skull was crushed twice by her horses

First, she lost her eye after her two-year-old horse Archie threw his hoof into the side of her face - smashing her eye socket and cheek bone into six pieces, and causing a brain haemorrhage

But just two years after her accident, she was kicked in the head again - shattering her other eye socket, and breaking the top part of her arm in half.

Ten months on from her second brush with death, doctors have still been unable to fix her broken arm - but she is still determined to follow her dream of becoming a para dressage champion.

Mrs Hope, who works in transport hire, said: 'To be kicked in the head by a horse once is incredibly unlucky - but twice is unbelievable.

'I've lost my eye and had to adjust to a whole new way of life, learning to do the most mundane tasks with limited vision.

'It's really hard to deal with becoming monocular later in life, as I have had to re-educate my brain.

'I couldn't believe it when I was kicked for a second time - my skull had only just really repaired itself from the first accident.

'My arm is so badly broken that surgeons are struggling to find a way to mend it. It's been broken in two places since May last year, and it just will not heal naturally.'

Mrs Hope has also suffered chronic osteomyilitus (an infection of the bones) and is currently receiving treatment for a suspected deep vein thrombosis.

She has also lost feeling in my ring and little finger and very little movement in her fingers.

She said: 'I don't blame my horses for what happened - they weren't trying to hurt me, and my injuries are something I just have to accept.

'It has made me determined to follow my dreams and to compete in and promote para sports and encourage others to give riding a try, for someone who cannot move I can't imagine the freedom and feeling of movement this would give.'

Two years later she was kicked in the head again, shattering her other eye socket, and breaking the top part of her arm in half

Ten months on from her second brush with death, doctors have still been unable to fix her broken arm

Her first accident happened as she mucked out her two-year-old gelding in December 2009. She said: 'I had given Archie a toy to play with in his stable. He was very excited by it, and was bucking waiting to get out.

'I went into the stable to get him and suddenly - bam! - his foot connected with my head.

'My body seemed to go onto autopilot. I didn't realise how badly hurt I was and I carried on working, before realising that I needed to call an ambulance.

'I don't remember much else apart from my mum and my husband shouting at me to stay awake.'If they hadn't kept me conscious, I doubt I'd be here today.

"When I finally came round, I was told that my eye was squashed like a grape on the floor. Doctors thought that my other eye might lose vision if my bad eye wasn't removed, so I agreed to have it taken out.

'I felt like a lamb to the slaughter when I walked into that operating theatre.

'The thought of losing my eye was terrifying. But I refused to allow myself to sit and dwell on what I'd lost. I had to just get on with it.

She has also suffered a chronic bone infection and has very little movement in her fingers

Determined: Despite her ordeal, Claire is still determined to follow her dream of becoming a para dressage champion

'I was desperate to get back and look after my horses, but I had to stay away for a month because of the risk of infection.

'I had to teach myself how to live again. Even the simplest tasks were a nightmare with only one eye, as I'd lost my sense of depth. It was so difficult to drive my car, or peg the washing out on the line - I'd constantly be reaching for things and they'd be nowhere near where I perceived them to be.

'Eight weeks after the accident, I was determined to get back on my horses, and although I was terrified, I managed to do it.

'Sadly, I had to sell Archie, as I couldn't risk being injured again as I broke him in to be ridden, but I keep in touch with his new owner.'

But as Mrs Hope started to get back on track, disaster struck again - after she was caught in the cross fire after her two other horses, Ollie and Costa, struck out in a field.

She was again rushed to the James Cook Hospital in Middlesbrough, where doctors battled to save her.

She said: 'I'd gone to feed the horses out in their field, and luckily, my husband Tony came with me.'I gave them separate feed bowls, but they started scrapping, and before I knew what had happened, I was struck again.

'I think that if I'd had 100 per cent vision, I might have seen what was happening quickly enough to get out of the way, but it happened before I even realised it.

'Again, I suffered serious facial injuries and my left humerus was snapped in half.

'I had pins and plates inserted into my arm in a bid to fuse the bones back together, but 10 months on, after chronic osteomyilitus it's still broken and supported with a plastic brace resembling a floppy sausage.

She is hoping that an operation next month will finally sort the problem. 

Mrs Hope added: 'Hopefully I'll be able to get back on a horse soon, and start some para dressage to music.

'My dream is to be good enough to compete at Tokyo 2020, although I may have to win the lottery, as to ride at this level you need a talented horse and loads of training.

'Funding and sponsorship are limited when you become disabled later in life and seems to apply to the under 25's, but maybe I'll get lucky given everything that's happened.

'I don't know where I get my motivation and drive but simply can't imagine life without a horse and am not prepared to settle for this option.

'I can't thank my family and friends enough for all the help and support they have given me - and the Mark Davies Injured Riders Fund, which has given me support and advice.

'I want to give people that have had a disabling injury hope that there is light at the end of the tunnel.'
