Louis van Gaal has one word for his achievements after three months in charge at Manchester United – great.

The Dutchman, who asked to be judged in mid-October when he took over at Old Trafford in July, was asked to assess his performance on Friday and the response was typically blunt.

‘I am always great,’ said Van Gaal. ‘That’s a very easy question. Thankyou!

‘How do I respond to that? No I’m not going in the right direction? No. I have confidence in myself and in my players and that is very important. But much more important is that the players have confidence in the manager and his staff.

‘When I respond I’m arrogant because normally I am always moving in the right direction – I have showed that already.’

Despite winning the last two games, United were holding on against Everton and West Ham and Van Gaal believes the players have still to fully embrace his philosophy.

He added: ‘I think they do understand the philosophy but they have to perform that philosophy. We have to see if it is going to a higher level. We need more balance in the team.

‘I said that after the match against Everton, and I am looking for balance in the team not only spectacular attacking football, but also when you lose the ball that you have a shape as a team and that you can defend more easily, and kill the game better.

‘That’s also part of the philosophy and also because I am always choosing creative attacking football players. So we are looking for the balance and we shall see if the time I have had was long enough.’
