It's only February but already Burnley would appear to be suffering from an acute case of relegation anxiety. For the second home game running in the Barclays Premier League, Sean Dyche's team failed to hold on to a two-goal advantage.

Unlike their previous home game – that they lost 3-2 to Crystal Palace – Burnley managed to hold on for a point here, a late goal line clearance from Ben Mee ensuring that disappointment didn't once again become calamity.

But Burnley have now taken one point when they really should have had six and, with a fixture list featuring both Manchester clubs, Chelsea, Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham between now and mid-April, this may yet be the kind of afternoon that ultimately sends them down.

If that sounds rather negative — Burnley are not actually in the bottom three at the moment — then that’s probably because Dyche’s team do not currently seem to have the wherewithal to survive. They are not short on talent and they are capable of playing attractive, incisive football.

Canny they are not, however. They are about as streetwise as a tourist walking down Oxford Street with their handbag hanging open and it is this that threatens them as the season begins to drift towards its defining weeks.

For half an hour here yesterday Burnley were terrific. Playing on an uneven surface, Dyche’s players passed the ball neatly and purposefully. They were two goals up before West Brom had really got going and the game looked as though it was almost over after goals from Ashley Barnes and the excellent Danny Ings.

However, a header from Chris Brunt just before half-time seemed to signal an almost total change of mood and emphasis. Sure enough, Burnley didn’t have the durability to take the blow on the chin and keep moving forward. As such, it surprised nobody when West Brom substitute Brown Ideye, the club’s £10million record signing, headed in the equaliser in the 67th minute. Ideye was close to a cut-price move to Qatar club Al Gharafa on transfer deadline day.

Afterwards Dyche did his utmost to spin the result positively but the Burnley manager put his finger on the problem when he said: ‘The margins are fine in this division. You have to be tuned in every inch of the way. You can’t switch off. You have to see every game through and play hard.

‘But I thought we were excellent on the whole. Particularly in the first half I thought we were great.’

Certainly Burnley didn’t look like a team with relegation issues in the first half. Ings could have put them ahead within a couple of minutes, striking a first time shot just over the bar from 15 yards, before Scott Arfield came even closer soon after.

Moving on to a low cross from the right, Arfield’s side-foot shot was perfectly struck and seemed destined for the top corner before Ben Foster reached out a hand and touched the ball onto the crossbar.

It was a terrific save from the goalkeeper and for a few minutes at least it ensured that parity remained. In only the 11th minute, though, Burnley scored the goal that already seemed inevitable as Ings won a tussle at the far post and hooked the ball back across the face of goal for Barnes to head in from a matter of yards.

At this stage, West Brom really were not in the game. Burnley were proving far too purposeful and they broke to score a second goal just after half an hour.

It was a neat and intelligent dummy by Kieran Trippier in the middle of the field that allowed the always dangerous George Boyd to find some space down the right. 

The former Hull City player still had much to do from tight on the touchline but his cross was well struck and that allowed Ings to meet it 12 yards out and head powerfully down and into the corner to Foster’s left.

West Brom manager Tony Pulis commented later that his team had started the game as though they were still in bed. He had a point. Despite the appointment of Darren Fletcher as captain, the visiting team were aimless and rudderless.

Brunt’s header from a corner just before the break changed everything, though, and when Ideye did likewise midway through the second half it was anybody’s game.

Burnley did come again late on. They probably should have had a penalty when Gareth McAuley handled a cross from Mee but the Burnley full back’s most significant contribution was still to come as he diverted Saido Berahino’s late shot away from goal after a mistake from Jason Shackell.

‘This is gonna be a tough one,’ said Pulis, referring to West Brom’s own relegation issue. ‘There isn’t that much time to do the things that need doing. But this is a good point for us. We were much better in the second half.’
