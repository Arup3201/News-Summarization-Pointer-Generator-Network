If you're going to pick a fight in New York City, it's probably best to avoid the man known for striking terror into the hearts of criminals everywhere.

Especially if said man is accompanied by a superhero pal with phenomenal strength, perfect balance and a superhuman speed and agility.

But try telling that to Thomas Rorke, 22, who fancied his chances in a fight with Batman and Spider-Man in Times Square on Saturday night.

According to the New York Daily News, Rorke, of Queens, was arrested after becoming involved in an altercation with two men dressed as the popular superheroes. 

The faux Batman and Spider-Man - Jose  Escalona, 41, and Abdel  Elkshezai, 35 - didn't fare much better in the scuffle and were also arrested. All three men were cuffed at the scene and charged with assault, police said.

But other caped crusaders leapt to the defence of their fellow superheroes and blamed a drunk Rorke for the fight.

'He was intoxicated and messing with Batman and they got into it,' said Paul Smith, 50, who also dons the red mask as Spider-Man in New York's Times Square.

'Everybody, no matter what costume they are wearing, has the right to protect themselves. It's like Stand Your Ground in Florida,' he added.

Meanwhile, a man dressed as Captain America was quick to defend Spider-man. 'He's one of the best guys, honest, religious,' he said. 'One of the first guys out here.'

Police said it was not immediately clear who started the fight.

Saturday's scuffle is part of a wider problem of costumed characters getting into trouble while performing in Times Square.

In 2012, a man dressed as Elmo was arrested for allegedly launching into an anti-Semitic tirade in Times Square, according to CBS New York

In June, the president of the Times Square Alliance called for regulations on costumed characters, saying they have gotten out of control.

'In the last 10 days alone, we've seen two Statues of Liberty arrested, a Spider-Man convicted of harassing a tourist, and now a third character arrested for groping a woman in Times Square,' Tim Tompkins said at the time.

'The situation is out of control and a licensing and regulatory scheme must be put in place,' he added.

In April 2013, a man dressed as the Cookie Monster was charged with endangering the welfare of a child after allegedly shoving a two-year-old boy, according to CBS New York. 

And  in 2012, a man dressed as Elmo was arrested for allegedly launching into an anti-Semitic tirade in Times Square. He pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct following the incident.
