Jack Wilshere is set to be handed the chance to play as Arsenal’s new midfield anchor next season.

Manager Arsene Wenger believes the 22-year-old has the football brain to play as his side’s holding central midfielder — a move that could save the club millions in the transfer market.

The club had identified a new defensive midfielder as one of their transfer priorities, with the Gunners looking at moves for Sami Khedira, Lars Bender and Morgan Schneiderlin.

Decision maker: Wenger will have a lot of choices to make in midfield this season including with Wilshere

But Wenger and his backroom staff believe they may already have the answer to the problem position.

Wilshere was part of the Arsenal squad that flew to America on Wednesday ahead of Saturday’s clash against New York Red Bulls. The squad arrived in the early hours on Thursday morning.

And Wenger could use the clash to examine the England international in the position.

In addition to Wilshere, the Arsenal manager also has Mikel Arteta and Mathieu Flamini who can play the role, while Abou Diaby is also fit again.

The news will come as a boost to Wilshere, who has not had the most memorable few months.

A foot injury sustained while playing for England wrecked the final few weeks of last season, while he was forced to play a peripheral role during the World Cup.

He was under the spotlight again last week after he was photographed smoking and behaving outrageously during a summer break in Las Vegas.

Major question marks have been raised over Wilshere’s long-term role in Wenger’s plans given the manager’s extensive midfield options.

With Aaron Ramsey established as the club’s premier central midfielder, Wilshere’s place in Arsenal’s engine room looks far from guaranteed with Arteta, Flamini, Diaby, Tomas Rosicky and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain all vying for a place alongside the Welshman.

But a transition to a deeper-lying midfield role could help Wilshere maintain a regular spot in Wenger’s starting XI next season, as well as strengthen his England chances.

Meanwhile, Atletico Madrid believe they can persuade Arsenal to part with Santi Cazorla this summer.

The Spain international is a long-term target of Diego Simeone and the Argentine hopes this could be the year he lands the attacker.

Cazorla has been an integral member of Wenger’s plans since his arrival from Malaga two years ago.

But competition for attacking midfield positions is fierce at Arsenal, particularly after the £30million arrival of Alexis Sanchez.

against Gunners legend Thierry Henry's New York Red Bulls.

In addition to the Chilean, Mesut Ozil, Lukas Podolski and Theo Walcott will all compete to play in positions behind the central striker next season.

And Atletico, who are also interested in Nacho Monreal, are hopeful that Wenger can be persuaded to part with Cazorla, despite the fact he only signed a 12 month contract extension earlier this year.

Arsenal have handed a trial to Serbian midfielder Mladen Micanovic, 17.

FK Javor Ivanjica youngster Micanovic can play in various positions in defence as well and is likely to train with the first team.
