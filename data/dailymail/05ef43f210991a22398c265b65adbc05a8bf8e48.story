The legal fees of Colonel Gaddafi’s son Saif will be funded by the British taxpayer as he faces a war crimes trial at the Hague.

An 'exceptional' decision has been taken to pay a British barrister to represent Saif Gaddafi, by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. The ICC receives around 20 per cent of its £100million funding from the UK.

Saif Gaddafi is currently being in Libya, where he is on trial via video link for corruption and war crimes in connection with the 2011 uprising. If he is found guilty, he is likely to be executed.

The ICC has ruled that the 41-year-old son of Gaddafi will not get a fair trial in his home country.

It instead wants him to released into its custody and to appear at The Hague on trial for war crimes.

The Sunday Telegraph  reports that the ICC court is now footing the bill for London based barrister John Jones to represent him - who has filed papers on behalf of Gaddafi accusing the Libyan government of breaching his client’s human rights.

The court said it had 'exceptionally decided to assume the costs of Mr Gaddafi’s legal representation on a provisional basis until such time as an assessment of his disposable means has been conducted'.

The decision by the ICC to fund Gaddafi's legal fees was criticised by politicians and military figures. 

Conservative MP Rob Wilson, parliamentary private secretary to Chancellor George Osborne, said the ICC was effectively handing legal aid to Saif Gaddafi - something which is only available to those who are wholly or partly indigent.

He said: 'This does not seem to be the case with Saif Gaddafi, who comes from a hugely wealthy family and is thought to have siphoned off millions of pounds over the years.'

Mr
 Jones told the paper that he is being paid £70-an-hour in legal 
fees, that the taxpayer’s contribution was 'infinitesimally small' 
and that his hours are capped by the ICC.

He
 said rather than focus on the costs of the trial he said that it should
 be known that Gaddafi  - who is currently being held in a prison in 
Zintan, and has appeared only via video link - is facing the death 
penalty and deserved the right to a fair trial.

The
 elder Gaddafi ruled Libya with an eccentric brutality for nearly 42 
years before he was ousted by an uprising in August 2011.

He was captured and killed in October, along with his son Muatassim.

Gaddafi's younger sons Seif al-Arab and Khamis were killed earlier in the civil war.

Saif is accused of murdering civilians during the Libyan revolution. He was charged alongside Abdullah al-Senussi, with war crimes and crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court.

George Clooney’s fiancée Amal Alamuddin, an international human rights lawyer, is representing al-Senussi, Colonel Gaddafi’s former right-hand man, who is accused of numerous atrocities against his people.

She is helping the 64-year-old appeal against the decision to allow his trial to take place in Libya, where he could face the death penalty.

al-Senussi was convicted in absentia by a French court for the 1989 bombing of a French airliner. In Libya he is accused of overseeing a prison massacre of 1,200 inmates as well as torture and hangings. 

Under United Nations rules, the Hague court was due to hear the case unless Libya could prove that it was capable of overseeing it.

Libya was given approval last October, despite allegations that al-Senussi had been mistreated  in custody.
