These are the breathtaking bird's eye view shots a paraglider took as he soared in the skies above the Lake District.

Stuart Holmes, 48, has spent the past three years with his head in the clouds and his camera ready to take beautiful aerial shots of the well trodden landscape.

The photographer, who learnt to paraglide in the Alps in 1987, used a Canon 5D to take more than 360 photographs at 70 locations in The Lakes.

Stuart, who lives in Keswick, Cumbria, said: 'Right from the start, I realised the huge potential for taking unusual landscape images from this privileged viewpoint normally restricted to the birds. 

Dramatic: Stuart took this flying above Wasdale Screes and Wastwater, which he described as 'always a treat. In late November the contrast between the russet coloured bracken, the dry dead fell grass and green fields is most dramatic'

An unusual view of the north-western Lake District with Keswick and Derwentwater made up of a series of vertical shots stitched together to create the panorama. 'The light was problematic as I was looking directly into the sun and there were deep shadows,' added Stuart

Incredible: The view of Kirk Fell, Great Gable and the Sca Fells. Stuart said: 'Occasionally you are rewarded with amazing flying when you just don't expect it. I walked up Pillar intending to have a quick fly down at sunset. The wind was just enough to keep me airborne then a small thermal took me high above the ridge giving me this incredible view. Not bad for late February'

'A paraglider is typically only flying at around 20mph which gives you a good amount of control and time to compose shots. 

'The downside is you are at the mercy of the wind and air currents as well as your own ability to use those air currents to stay up and move around.' 

He claims his love of paragliding has helped boost his love of photography.

'It takes me to places people don't usually see, it is a truly amazing way of experiencing The Lakes,' he said.

'A lot of people take a camera with them when they go flying but not everybody takes a high quality camera and can take the time to get into position to take a decent picture.' 

Using mainly wide angles, Stuart was able to capture beautiful panoramic shots without compromise. 

Stuart says he flew in special conditions above the Lorton Valley with Grassmoor in front and Crummock Water below to capture this picture where his feet make an appearance. 'The cloud was forming below us and we had to be careful where we flew so as not to lose sight of the ground,' he said

Captured during an evening flight with a friend on Scafell Pike. Stuart said: 'The sun was shining through gaps in the cloud just before sunset, painting the crags and scree in a golden light, a magical time of the day to be up here'

But Stuart says no matter how spectacular a scene, he sometimes refrains from letting go off the controls to take up his camera for safety reasons.

'Carrying and operating a bulky and heavy SLR in the air is not ideal when trying to maintain control of the wing; not hitting anything is a priority and essential to my health and continued enjoyment of life,' he said.

'Occasionally the air is too rough and no matter how spectacular the scene around, I dare not release the controls to take up my camera for fear of losing control.'

Stuart captured this while looking down to the Mary Mount and Lodore Hotels with the Derwent River flowing out into Derwentwater

Bird's eye view: Stuart says he created a special harness and uses a remote control to trigger the shutter to capture self-portraits including this one over Calf Close Bay, Derwentwater, near Keswick

Ultimate selfie: Paraglider pilot Stuart took this on warm summer evening flying above Walla Crag and Derwentwater. 'A fast shutter speed is required here to freeze the movement. A bit of background blur indicates I was spinning quite fast,' he said

And Stuart has even managed a few 'selfies' using a specially made harness and a remote control to trigger the shutter. 

He said: 'I have experimented with self portraits whilst flying, the view from up high in the wing looking straight down with the glider lines leading the eye straight to the pilot is very effective, especially when combined with a spectacular backdrop. 

'I have rigged up an extra line in my wing that I attach my camera to in a specially made harness. This line goes up from me to a pulley near the top of my glider and then back down to me. 

'During stable flight I can pull on one end and hoist the camera up towards the canopy itself. To stop the camera swinging wildly about I have two short lines with clips attached to the camera strap lugs that act like side lines which I clip onto glider lines to run up and down.

'I use a remote control to trigger the shutter.' 

For 20 years, Stuart worked as an exploration geologist, traveling to remote locations around the globe. It allowed him to go climbing, paragliding and exploring armed with a camera. 

Since starting his company FotoVUE with friend and rock climber Michael Ryan, Stuart has amassed a vertigo-inducing collection of shots of the region. 

He has spent three years photographing and writing a book called Photographing the Lake District, the first book in a series of ten. The other nine will cover different parts of the UK.

Stuart said: 'I have been paragliding over 20 years and took photos from the air in all that time.

'There are no aerial shots in the book.

'The book is designed for anyone with an interest in the Lake District to direct them to some of the most beautiful places and help them take amazing photographs.' 

Beautiful: From around 4500ft, Stuart managed to take this over Blea Water and Haweswater. Stuart said: 'These days are relatively rare when the air is so clear and conditions for paragliding are optimal'

Looking down onto Sprinkling Tarn with Great End above it and Scafell Pike beyond from around 4500ft. Stuart said: 'After taking off from the side of Catbells I used thermal currents to get high and bob along to fly over the highest peaks of the central fells'

Fleetwith Pike and part of Honister slate mines looking down Honister Valley towards Buttermere. 'Sometimes it's nice to get closer to the landscape with a longer lens or selective cropping,' said Stuart

Abstract: A fellow glider is seen over this jagged path up Blease Fell on Blencantha. Stuart said: 'By cropping tightly to remove all distractions and reference to location the path up Blease Fell on Blencathra is turned into an abstract'

Long shadows can be seen towards the end of the day at Castlerigg Stone Circle above Keswick. 'I landed in the centre of the circle just as a coach load of tourists arrived, it's not often you get a round of applause on landing,' said Stuart

Flying above his home patch of the Keswick valley, Stuart said: 'Sometimes from up high the air is so clear you can see Snowdonia in Wales, the Mourne Mountains of Ireland and Scotland just 25 miles to the north'

A tiny paraglider can be seen in the top left hand of this image over Derwentwater, Skiddaw and Blencathra. 'April in the Lakes is the start of the good flying season with strong thermals and longer hours of daylight. I took off from Threlkeld Knotts which is the hill at bottom right'

Grassmoor and Crummock Water with Buttermere off to the left and Loweswater on the right. 'This was one of those days where you could almost fly anywhere in the Lakes. I spent 4 hours in the air photographing around the Buttermere Valley, I was absolutely buzzing with the experience when I got down,' said Stuart

Vertigo: Looking down to Helvellyn and Thirlmere from around 5000ft. 'One of my best flights in the Lakes, we took off from above Swindale near Haweswater and I flew back home to Keswick high over the mountains'

The red sandstone cliffs of St Bees Head, the most westerly point of both Cumbria and Northern England. 'Coastal flying is quite different to inland flying, the air off the sea is usually very smooth without a ripple to disturb you. This makes photography much less stressful not having to worry about your glider so much' said Stuart
