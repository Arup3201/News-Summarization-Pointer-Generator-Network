The grieving widow of a the Sparks, Nevada school teacher tragically slain by a student last week has broken her silence to describe the last touching moments she shared with her husband.

Sharon Landsberry was usually asleep as her math teacher husband Michael, 45, left for work each day. But on October 21, she was awake to share a goodbye Sharon had no idea would be their last.

‘The last words I heard from him was 'Have a good day my beautiful wife,’ Landsberry said.

Widowed: Sharon Landsberry has broken her silence about the final touching moments she shared with her heroic teacher husband Michael, who was gunned down October 21 in a Sparks, Nevada school shooting

Loving: Michael left a Post-It note for his wife every morning on his way to work as she slept

Landsberry spoke for the first time Tuesday about that faithful morning and about her husband’s usual habit of leaving a Post-It on her coffee cup with a loving message as she slept.

‘The coffee would be ready, he'd get my coffee cup out and put a sticky note on it and write, “Hey my beautiful wife” or “Have a good day, I love you.” It was always different,’ she told KTVN.

Landsberry appears remarkably upbeat in the interview in which she calls her late husband, ‘my everything.’

‘I can't wait to be home with you and go for our walk. I love you,’ Michael said to Sharon before he left.

While those loving words were remain only in Sharon’s memory, the Nevada widow still has his daily morning messages.

She saved every one of the sticky notes, and is now glad she did.

An hour after they parted ways, shots broke out at Sparks Middle School.

‘When I first heard this going and I didn't get a text message back from him, I knew...I knew exactly what he did,’ she told KTVN. ‘I knew he stepped in front.’

Her husband, a former Marine and an Air National Guardsman, tried to stop 12-year-old Jose Reyes’ rampage with a 9mm Ruger and died for his heroics.

Love notes: Sharon Landsberry saved each and every Post-It note her slain husband left on her coffee cup over the years and she's now glad she did

'I had a love that most people will never ever experience': Sharon says her husband's maxim was to stay forever positive. Now she and her daughters are trying to live out his words by turning his death into a positive thing

‘He's always said and he's told the kids that he would protect them and that's exactly what he did,’ she said. ‘He would do it for anyone he loved.’

His loved ones included his adoring wife, but also her daughters, who he’s now left behind.

But in spite of her massive loss, Sharon manages to stay positive, something she says her husband always insisted she and the girls do.

¿I knew he stepped in front': Sharon says her husband's first priority was always the safety of his students and family and that she knew he'd put his life on the line as soon as she got word of the October 21 shooting

‘I had a love that most people will never ever experience and I'm so grateful that I got the chance to experience it with him,’ she said. ‘We'll continue to move forward just like Mike would want us to do and be strong and do something positive out of what happened.’

As for her last words to Michael: ‘I love you too,’ she told him. ‘You have a good day and he walked out the door.’

Landsberry coached basketball and soccer and was known as a big fan of Batman.
