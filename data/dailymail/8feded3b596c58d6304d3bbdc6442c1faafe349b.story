A horrified shopper has told how she found two false widow spiders in a bunch of red grapes from a Co-Op supermarket.

Nichole Sarra, 28, was puzzled to see 'dust and cobwebs' when she opened the bag for lunch at her office in Cardiff Bay before spotting the live venomous arachnid.

Luckily for Ms Sarra, experts believe the spider was a male - and it is female false widows whose bites have made headlines.

Creepy-crawlies: Shopper Nichola Sarra found this spider - believed to be a false widow, Britain's most venomous - in a bag of red grapes which she had bought for lunch from a Co-Op branch in Cardiff Bay

But she complained to the store's customer service department - and then found a second identical spider lying dead at the bottom of the bag.

Ms Sarra said she jumped in shock when she noticed the first spider, drawing the attention of colleagues who took photos of it.

'We weren't sure at first if it was a false widow spider,' she said.

'But my colleagues looked at the markings on its back and after looking online identified it as a false widow spider.

'After that no one wanted to go near the grapes.' 

A British Arachnological Society spokesman confirmed the spider 'certainly looks like a false widow spider'.

They've inspired terror into millions, sparking complaints that their danger has been over-hyped. So what are false widow spiders?

Much of their reputation is thought to be thanks to the black widow, which although similarly named is far more dangerous and has been known to kill children, ill or elderly people.

Although its bites can be intensely uncomfortable - swelling hugely when infected - the false widow (above) is not known to have caused any deaths in Britain.

By comparison, around four Britons each year are though to die from bee or wasp stings when they have an allergic reaction.

False widow spiders are distinctive with their shiny, black flesh, bulbous bodies, thick legs and skull-like patterns.

Millions of false widows, Britain's most venomous spider, are found across the UK and the population is growing.

Also known by its Latin name Steatoda Nobilis, its first British sighting was in Torquay, Devon, in 1879 and is thought to have remained largely in southern England. 

But the Natural History Museum says warmer summers mean the spider is spreading north, a theory backed by wildlife sightings. 

However, the spokesman added it looked like a male, saying: 'Only the females have been known to bite on rare occasions'.

Ms Sarra sent the picture to the Co-Op and was put in touch with the customer service department.

'I was told to go back to the bag of grapes and get the barcode number so they could track it,' she said. 'They believed it came from Spain'. 

A spokesman for the Co-operative Food said: 'We are committed to working closely with farmers and suppliers in order to provide a consistently great shopping experience for our customers.

'We are sorry that this product fell short of those expectations and will investigate the matter with our supplier.'

As Britain's most venomous spider species, false widows made headlines last year when victims told how they had suffered huge wounds and almost lost limbs.

An entire secondary school was shut in October in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, after an outbreak of the arachnids in its ICT block had to be fumigated.

In the worst cases, suspected bite victims have been treated in hospital or complained of ongoing health problems several months later.

But many experts insist the spiders are not particularly dangerous and will only bite if approached or handled.

There have been no reported deaths from the spiders in Britain, where they are believed to have arrived on crates of fruit from the Canary Islands in the 1870s.

It is thought many of the worst reactions happen when bites become infected, rather than being linked to the spider's venom itself.
