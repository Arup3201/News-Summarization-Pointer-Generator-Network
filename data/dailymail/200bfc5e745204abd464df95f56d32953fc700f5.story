Frigid winter weather dumped huge amounts of snow on parts of the Midwest and transformed summer breezes into gusts far below freezing in a matter of hours is headed for the East Coast.

A huge front of cold air that has swamped Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan with intense and dangerous flurries of snow pushed south overnight, freezing places as far south as Oklahoma and Texas.

And by Thursday, the system will have reached New England and the Atlantic seaboard, where it could send temperatures plunging by 15 to 20 degrees. By the weekend freezing temperatures could reach as far south as Atlanta, Georgia.

Frozen: A couple in Bozeman, Montana, brave the cold to walk their dogs after snows hit the region. Bozeman has reported temperatures of -6 degrees

Snowfall: Wisconsin, upper Michigan and Minnesota were buried in snow, 

According to the National Weather Service, snow could spread as far as Ohio, West Virginia, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and upstate New York - though New York City will not be hit. 

Wednesday morning the worst-hit states were still dealing with the huge volumes of snow which fell in the three-day storm.

In Ishpeming, on Michigan's upper peninsula, 36.1 inches of snow has fallen since Sunday, with more to come thanks to its proximity to Lake Superior.

Many roads were snow-covered and slippery Wednesday morning in the Upper Peninsula, where residents are accustomed to snowy conditions.

Meteorologist Justin Titus said that on his way to work roads were 'just rutted out and kind of felt like you were driving over a washboard.' 

Advancing chill: The cold, which pushed south Tuesday, will move further east by the weekend

Chills: Over night temperatures will plunge well below zero in the worst-affected areas, such as Rapid City, South Dakota

Chilly: Cold temperatures turned melting snow into icicles on rooftops in Montana thanks to the frigid air

Other parts of northern Michigan had almost as much snow. Cambridge, Minnesota, was hit with 16.5 inches, though snow has now stopped falling there. Minneapolis and St Paul were also badly hit.

Minnesota's State Patrol reported some 500 road accidents - two of which were fatal - in the wake of the snowfall. Many students stayed home from school due to the weather, though more than ever they were able to take classes over the internet rather than miss a day.

Flurries also hit Colorado, Idaho, Montana and the Dakotas, accompanied in some points by extremes of cold. This morning Casper, Wyoming, reported temperatures of -22 degrees.

Accidents: Hundreds of road crashes were reported in the icy conditions - pictured above is a Colorado State Police officer investigating a crash outside Colorado Springs

In Billings, Montana, where temperatures fell from the high 60s into the single digits on Tuesday, Patsy Kimmel said she was warned about the weather before arriving from Oklahoma to celebrate her 70th birthday with family.

'Yesterday I was wearing sandals and a short-sleeve shirt, and today I'm wearing a coat and scarf and turtleneck and sweatshirt and gloves,' she said.

In the Texas Panhandle, temperatures plunged from 70 degrees into the teens overnight. Oklahoma City went from a high of 80 degrees Monday to a low of 30 Tuesday morning.

In the Dakotas, wind chills made it feel like 20 below in some places. That was good news for Action Mechanical Inc. of Rapid City, South Dakota, a heating and ventilation business that was doing booming trade.

'Bang! We get this arctic blast, and it just opens the floodgates,' said John Hammond Jr., a department head. 'We're behind right now as we're sitting here talking.' 

Respect: Snow fell on war graves in Colorado Springs on Veterans Day Tuesday

The epicenter of the phenomenon is the remnants of Typhoon Nuri, which is causing areas of exceptionally low pressure over the Bering Sea, between Russia and Alaska.

This has bent the jet stream, a barrier of wind which usually keeps hot and cold air separate, pulling warm air north and pushing cold air south.

The pattern of pressures forms a bulge that resembles the Greek letter omega (Ω), and is therefore referred to as an Omega Block.

Phenomenon: The weather system is being driven by the remains of Typhoon Nuri (above in purple), which is sitting west of Alaska, sucking up warm air and forcing cold air down into the mainland United States

Cold air which would usually sits near Canada has been pulled down as far as Texas, while warmer air from around the United States sails north. As the front approached, temperatures in Texas, Oklahoma and Missouri plunged from the 70s into the teens in a matter of hours.

In Colorado, a huge dust storm accompanied the advancing front, and was pictured from above by an airplane passenger.

The same phenomenon is warming up Alaska, with the result that, later this week, even the north of the region could be warmer than Dallas.
