Liverpool star Daniel Sturridge is best known for his football talent but the injured striker has clearly been turning heads off the pitch after being nominated in the British Fashions Awards.

The England international is one of 20 nominees for the British Style Award and is up against some of the biggest names in fashion such as Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne and David Gandy.

The 25-year-old is also nominated alongside former footballer David Beckham and household names such as Tinie Tempah, Rita Ora and Keira Knightley, with the winner announced on December 1.

According to the awards website: ‘The British Style Award recognises an individual who most embodies the spirit of British fashion and is an international ambassador for London as a leading creative fashion capital.’

Sturridge regularly posts on social media posing in his latest outfits and has appeared in several fashion magazines in shoots.

The Liverpool forward is out until mid-November after another injury set-back which will see him miss Liverpool’s biggest week of the season so far with a calf problem.

Liverpool face a trip to Newcastle on Saturday before heading to Spain for a Champions League clash against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and complete the grueling seven days without Sturridge against Chelsea at Anfield.

Sturridge, who has not played for his club since August 31, damaged his calf two weeks ago in training as he was working his way back from a thigh injury.

Currently, Sturridge will also miss England matches against Slovenia and Scotland next month as he continues his recovery.
