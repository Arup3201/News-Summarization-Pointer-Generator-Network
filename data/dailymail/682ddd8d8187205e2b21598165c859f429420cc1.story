The Queen arrived at Kings Lynn station this morning by public train - but not before local police had secured the area.

She was en route to Sandringham, her Norfolk estate, where the royal family traditionally spend the Christmas period.

But there was no sign of the Duke of Edinburgh, with the Queen arriving accompanied only by her close protection team.

Christmas holiday: The Queen arrives at Kings Lynn station en route to Sandringham

According to Buckingham Palace sources, the Duke has remained in London but will join the Queen shortly.

The monarch has made a habit of taking the train to Sandringham, albeit in First Class, setting off from King's Cross station in London and arriving at Kings Lynn  an hour and a half later.

Her Majesty certainly appeared to be looking forward to her break, beaming broadly as she strode down the platform wearing an eau-de-nil tweed coat and one of her trademark floral headscarves.

Members of the wider royal family will begin arriving next week with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall expected on Christmas Eve, along with Prince Harry.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, meanwhile, are set to spend their first Christmas at their Norfolk home Anmer Hall but will join the rest of the royal family at Sandringham on the day itself.

Sandringham has been owned by the royal family since 1862 when it was purchased by Queen Victoria at the request of her son Edward, then Prince of Wales.

Since then, the house has been in continuous use by the royal family and it was there that King George VI died on the 6th February 1952.

It is also from Sandringham that the Queen's annual Christmas speech is broadcast, usually uncontroversially, although this year looks set to change all that.

Bookies, among them William Hill and Coral, have suspended betting on the Queen revealing abdication plans in this year's speech.

Although Buckingham Palace sources have previously said the Queen will never step down, betting was halted following a flurry of surprise wagers.

'Throughout the year there has been major speculation about the Queen's future but the gamble has really caught us by surprise,' said Coral's Nicola McGeady.

'As far as we are concerned there's no smoke without fire when bets like this come through all in succession, so we have decided to be safe rather than sorry and pull the plug on the market.'

On her way: The Queen will now remain at Sandringham until mid February

Looking forward to Christmas: The Queen appeared to be looking forward to her break and was all smiles

A Palace spokesperson refused to comment, but did highlight the pledges made by the Queen in her 21st birthday speech in 1947.

The young Royal said: 'I declare before you all that my whole life whether it be long or short shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong.'

In her June 1953 Coronation Day speech, she also said: 'I have in sincerity pledged myself to your service, as so many of you are pledged to mine.

Although it is rare for British monarchs to step aside, with Edward VIII the only monarch to do so, the practice is considerably more common in Europe, where no less than four have stood down in the last two years.

2013 was the busiest year for abdications, with Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands, King Albert II of Belgium and Pope Benedict XVI all stepping down.

Rumours: She has been plagued by abdication rumours after bets were suspended on an announcement

New ruler: King Felipe of Spain is the newest European monarch after his father stepped down in June

The following Spring, King Juan-Carlos of Spain, 76, announced plans to step down on the grounds that 'I don't want my son to grow old waiting like Prince Charles'.

He formally abdicated on the 18th June, making him the fourth European monarch to do so in less than a year.

Despite the flurry of abdications, the Queen has always stated that she has no plans to do the same, despite being older than all of the four.

One monarch who may yet do so is Denmark's Queen Margrethe, 74, who has been on the Danish throne for 42 years and has an heir, Crown Prince Frederik, of the same age as 46-year-old King Felipe.

However, despite claims in an Australian magazine that an announcement is imminent, sources close to the Danish queen have said she has no intention of stepping down and described the reports as 'all lies'.
