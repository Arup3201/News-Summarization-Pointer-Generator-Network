When you are related to royalty, life can become one long social whirl.

And so it has proved for Pippa Middleton, who can barely have paused for breath in the past week as she appeared at a series of high-profile events.

The latest was as a guest at Sir David Frost’s annual summer party, where the Duchess of Cambridge’s younger sister mingled with the great and the good from the media, politics and showbusiness, including Sir Michael Caine, Stephen Fry, Sir Elton John and Sir Bruce Forsyth.

Social whirl: Pippa at the wedding in Alnwick (l-r), shopping near her home, at Wimbledon on Monday and at Sir David Frost's annual party

Miss Middleton, who was without her boyfriend Nico Jackson, looked striking in a vampish red lace sleeveless dress with nude underlay and sheer top.

The Alice by Temperley Alberto dress cost £445, but is now on sale for £222.50.

The 29-year-old paired it with a £135 pair of suede strapped wedges by Ash, a sensible choice for a reception on a lawn in a British summer.

Described as a ‘simple and elegant 
occasion dress’, it is made from red cotton lace attached at the neck to
 a sheer ‘barely there’ chiffon panel which unzips at the back.

Pippa's outfit was the latest in a string of fashions Miss Middleton has been seen sporting in recent days – some with more success than others.

David Frost said Pippa was invited because the pair met before the royal wedding and she has been for dinner

On Saturday she attended the society wedding of the year, the marriage of the Duke of Northumberland’s daughter Lady Melissa Percy to City broker Thomas van Straubenzee in Alnwick, Northumberland.

Miss Middleton wore a black and white Tabitha Webb dress that drew compliments from onlookers.

On Monday, wearing an elegant pale blue Sandro dress, she was in the royal box at Wimbledon to watch Roger Federer and Andy Murray win their first round matches. However, fashion followers pointed out that both styles had in the past been worn by model Kelly Brook.

And on Tuesday, Miss Middleton drew unflattering comments as she was spotted returning from the shops in West London in a coral cashmere dress and cardigan.

Tuesday night’s party, hosted by Sir David, 74, at the Royal Hospital Chelsea, also numbered politicians Lord Hurd and Ken Livingstone among the 300 guests.

Sir David told the Mail: ‘It was a 
wonderful evening. We were very lucky with the weather and it was a 
fabulous mix of company, everyone was on very good form.’

Asked how he knew Pippa, the broadcaster explained: ‘We met her before 
the wedding and she has since been to dinner at our house in Chelsea, so
 she is a friend in that sense.

‘She is a lovely young women, very witty and can hold her own in all 
kinds of conversation. She has taken the enormous interest in her very 
much in her stride.

‘One of the oldest guests there last night was the television presenter 
Dennis Norden who, I learned, was 91, so it is always nice to have a 
young mix of guests there too.’

That wit is also in evidence in a new diary she has written for today’s edition of The Spectator magazine in which she once again challenges London mayor Boris Johnson to a table tennis match.

She says: ‘The last time I wrote in these pages, I issued a challenge to Boris Johnson to take me on at ping pong. The Mayor said he’d be up for it, and his office duly contacted The Spectator to arrange the details.

'Team Johnson insisted that the match should be held at a venue of their choosing. I said by all means. And then — nothing. The Spectator has tried to follow up, but now it’s radio silence from the Mayor’s office. Is Boris scared or what? He should be.’

Middleton wrote about her love of 'Wimbers' in her column for The Spectator

Much of her column, however, was saved for Wimbledon or ‘Wimbers’, as she calls it.

‘Wimbers is tennis at its best, the grandest of all slams, which is why I like to go every year, at least twice,’ she writes, which means there is clearly one more appearance to go this year.

She also wades into the evergreen row about men’s versus women’s tennis, saying: ‘Typically I prefer watching the men to the women. I don’t hate my own sex or anything; I just can’t stomach the women players’ shrieking…..There are male grunters, it should be said (Nadal, Agassi, Ferrer, Djokovic — though not, of course, the serene and beautiful Roger Federer), but they have a lower pitch so it’s not too offputting. The shriekers, by contrast, howl so loudly that they make it hard for the audience to focus on the tennis. ‘

She also recommends a small flutter on Jo Wilfried Tsonga at 28/1 to win the championships – unfortunate as he pulled out yesterday with a knee injury.
