A mystery woman who looked like the elderly widow who recently won the record $590million Powerball jackpot has surprised 180 people by picking up their restaurant tab.

The woman, who appeared to be 84-year-old Gloria C. MacKenzie according to witnesses, paid almost $2,600 for the customers' dinners at Buddy Freddy's in Plant City, Florida on Sunday.

Restaurant manager Stephanie Reaves told the Tampa Bay Times that the woman, who was with another woman and younger man, ate at the restaurant and then left before returning to pay the bill.

She even left $50 each for each of the five servers, and Reaves said everyone in the restaurant got up and applauded.

The donor denied she was the lottery winner but Reaves said she 'fit the description'.

'It sure looked like her,' she said. 'She looked like the woman on TV.'

MacKenzie is from Zephyrhills, which is about 15 miles north of Plant City. She  stepped forward last week to claim the largest single jackpot in American lottery history.

If the dinner donor was indeed MacKenzie, it 
appears the lottery winner is using her wealth generously after 
herself struggling financially for decades.

Since her win, it has emerged that 
MacKenzie, who lived in a one-bedroom duplex with a tin roof,  had not 
even been able to afford a hearing aid, according to the National 
Enquirer.

Friends said she was almost deaf and would simply wave at neighbors as they passed because she had been unable to hear them.

'She was too proud to beg for help 
from anyone,' a source told the Enquirer. 'It's wonderful that she'll 
now be able to hear properly again and never have to worry about where 
her next dollar is coming from.'

Each month, she scraped together $400 for rent and was recently reeling from the theft of her air conditioner unit. She stayed inside crocheting and watching television, friends said.

Before her lottery win, she lived in this squat, modest duplex with a tin roof in 
Zephyhills, Florida

She claimed the prize two weeks after buying the winning ticket at a Publix supermarket in Zephyhills.

She told lottery officials she received the lucky numbers -  10,
 13, 14, 22 and 52, with a Powerball of 11 - after buying a randomized 
'quick pick' ticket when someone allowed her to cut in line.

Mrs Mackenzie, whose husband 
Ralph died in 2005 at age 79, will split the winnings with her son Scott, 54, of Jacksonville, Florida.

She
 told lottery officials that before she won, she and her son made an
 agreement to share any winnings, and she had been with him when she purchased the ticket.

Buzz: News of the winning ticket being sold at a Publix supermarket in Zephyhills, Florida, brought international attention to the small city

Mrs Mackenzie has two sons and two daughters and at least four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

Most of her family remains in her home state of Maine. It is unknown how, or if, she plans to share the jackpot with them.

One previous lottery jackpot was 
larger than the $590million sum - a $656million MegaMillions drawing 
last March - though three tickets matched the winning numbers and had to
 split the prize.
