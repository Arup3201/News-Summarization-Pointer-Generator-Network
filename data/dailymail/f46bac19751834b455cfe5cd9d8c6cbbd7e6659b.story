A first-grader was forced to sit on the floor of her Texas classroom with a clipboard for more than a month as punishment for drawing on her desk.

The Westwood Elementary student was sent to the principal's office, missed out on recess, washed the desk and wrote an apologetic letter to the janitor after  sketching in pencil in May.

But without informing the girl's parents, the teacher also punished the unidentified girl by making her sit on the floor.

The girl went without a desk for more than a month, unable to see the teacher or blackboard, before she told her parents.

'I was never told that her desk was removed,' the girl's furious mother told KHOU 11.

'I asked her (the girl), 'Why did you not tell me?' And she said, 'I was too scared to tell you mama'. She thought what she had done was so bad she didn't deserve to have a desk.'

The mother is trying to transfer both her son and daughter to another school and has filed a grievance.

School district Spring Branch ISD told ABC 13 Eyewitness News the teacher was reprimanded.

'The family has been offered multiple opportunities to transfer their child, either to another teacher within the school or to any elementary school in the district where enrollment is not capped,' the district said in a statement.

Furious: The girl's mother, who chose not to be identified to protect her daughter's identity, said she is now trying to transfer her children out of Westwood Elementary School in Houston, Texas
