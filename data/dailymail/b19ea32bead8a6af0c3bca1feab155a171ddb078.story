Roy Keane has been summonsed to court after he was accused of a road rage rant with a taxi driver at a set of traffic lights.

The former Manchester United star has been ordered to attend Trafford Magistrates Court later this month for a Section 4A Public Order offence.

Ex-Sunderland and Ipswich Town manager Keane, currently Republic of Ireland coach, was said to have launched into a foul-mouthed tirade and made obscene gestures after jumping out his Range Rover in Altrincham, Greater Manchester.

Roy Keane was questioned under police caution following the alleged bust-up with taxi driver

Fateh Kerar, 44, claims the row last month was sparked when he and his female passenger spotted the TV pundit at a cash machine in nearby Hale.

He says he said 'hello' to the 43-year-old and asked him to 'smile' before Keane got into his car and began following his taxi.

It is then alleged that when the cars stopped at traffic lights an 'angry' Keane, who lives in Bowdon, Cheshire, got out and started acting 'very aggressive'.

Police launched an investigation into the incident at 11.30am on January 30 and Keane, previously a coach at Aston Villa, was interviewed under caution by officers at a police station earlier this month.

They have now decided to bring him to court.

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: 'A summons was posted on 2 March 2015 for Roy Keane to his home address in Hale to appear before Trafford Magistrates court on 31 March 2015 for a Section 4A Public Order offence.

'This is in relation to an incident on Friday 30 January 2015 when police were called to Ashley Road, Altrincham to a report that a man had behaved aggressively towards another man.'
