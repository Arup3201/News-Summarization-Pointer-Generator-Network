A hacker took over Chrysler's Jeep Twitter account on Tuesday, sending out colorful tweets disparaging the off-road vehicle and its CEO just a day after Burger King's feed was similarly hijacked.

The cyber-attacker, who is believed to be New England-based DJ Tony 'iThug' Cunha, with the group Defonic Team Screen Name Club, replaced Jeep's logo with Cadillac's, claiming the latter had snapped up the Chrysler brand.

'The official Twitter handle for the Jeep - Just Empty Every Pocket. Sold to Cadillac ... In a hood near you!' read the tagline on Jeep's Twitter page.

'Sorry guys ... no more Jeep production because we caught our CEO doing this,' read one tweet that linked to a picture of a man inhaling on what appeared to be a bong.

A Cadillac spokesman in Detroit said the brand had no official comment, other than to observe there was 'some Twitter mischief going on.'

According to Gizmodo, Cunha also allegedly breached the Twitter account of Burger King Worldwide Inc on Sunday, posting the online equivalent of graffiti and forcing its suspension for about an hour.

Similar to the Jeep hijacking, the Burger King assailant claimed the hamburger chain had been sold to arch-rival McDonald's Corp.

Gizmodo reported that Cunha, who formerly hacked MySpace pages as a teen under the DTSNC group, left a paper trail in both the @BurgerKing and @Jeep hackings.

It said he sent out numerous tweets referencing 'iThug,' many of which were targeted at his friends.

But he reportedly revealed his identity when iThug bragged about his feat to a girl using his real name on Facebook, which had the incriminating URL of Facebook.com/ithug. It has now been deleted.

Ignite Social Media, the North Carolina-based agency that manages Twitter and other social media accounts for most of Chrysler's brands in North America, noticed the first unauthorized tweet on Jeep's site at 1:32 p.m. ET Tuesday, according to Ed Garsten, head of Chrysler digital media.

'They immediately contacted Twitter to start the process to regain control of the account,' Garsten said, adding that the account was back under Chrysler's control in less than an hour.

'The agency and the company are looking at strengthening security on the site,' said Garsten. This would include stronger passwords and other measures.

Garsten said they had 'no idea' who did it.

'I understand Twitter was especially prepared to deal with today's situation because they just went through the process with Burger King,' he said.

Other companies took advantage of the attention surrounding the Twitter hackings to promote their own brands.

Viacom
Inc's MTV sent out a message that it also had been hacked on its 
official Twitter account with more than 6.6 million followers. But it 
was just a prank, which was confirmed on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon. 
BET, also owned by Viacom, pulled a similar stunt.

Twitter,
which industry experts say has a poor track record on online security 
and reliability, has over the past year begun courting big corporate 
sponsors, hoping to beef up its revenue stream as it competes for Web 
surfers with Google Inc and Facebook Inc.

Industry
analysts have urged the company for years to beef up online security by
adopting 'two-factor authentication' or encrypting its website, among 
other measures.

This month, anonymous hackers broke into Twitter and possibly gained access to passwords and other information for as many as 250,000 user accounts.

'Whopper flopped': Burger King's Twitter account has been hacked by a McDonald's fan who has changed the branding of their page to feature McDonald's food, their logo and their name

'Twitter is like Facebook in that it 
started as a way of sharing thoughts and friendships, and security seems
to be the antithesis of sharing. After all, how much damage can a 
little 140-character message do?' said Murray Jennex, a cyber-security 
expert at San Diego State University.

'That
said, when business saw an opportunity to do business using Twitter, 
that risk assessment went away and, at that point, Twitter should have 
implemented a SecureID or two-factor authentication login.'

On
Sunday, the branding of Burger King's Twitter page, which has more than
89,000 followers, was been changed to feature their rival's food and 
even their logo and Twitter name were replaced with McDonalds 
@BurgerKing.

The first sign
of trouble was a post made from the official Burger King account 
stating: 'We just got sold to McDonalds! Look for McDonalds in a hood 
near you.'

Promoting their rival: From the hacked Burger King account, posts such as this one have been posted today, promoting McDonald's food

The Burger King Twitter account was 
suspended after several posts, some racist and offensive, were made by 
the McDonald's fan over several hours.

From the Burger King account, the 
hacker promoted McDonald's food, posting: 'Try our new BK (sm) Bath 
Salt! 99% Pure MDPV! Buy a Big Mac, get a gram free!'

That
was followed by a string of Tweets from several Twitter users as news 
of the hack went viral with many tweeting and re-tweeting posts from the
hacker.

One Twitter user wrote: 'Somebody needs to tell Burgerking that 'whopper123' isn't a secure password.'

Another wrote: 'Yo @burgerking I tried ordering a Bic Mac at the drive through and got laughed at :( #specialsauce'

A
Burger King spokesperson told MailOnline yesterday: 'It has come to our
attention that the Twitter account of BURGER KING® brand has been 
hacked.

Gone viral: Twitter users posted their thoughts on the hacking as the Burger King hacker continued to post from the account

With the fast-food chains and Twitter yet to make any official statement, Twitter users commented on the incident

'We have worked directly with 
administrators to suspend the account until we are able to re-establish 
our legitimate site and authentic postings. 

'We apologise to our followers who 
have been receiving erroneous tweets about other members of our industry
and additional inappropriate topics.'

McDonald's denied any involvement in 
the hacking, posting on their Twitter page: 'We empathize with
our @BurgerKing counterparts. Rest assured, we had nothing to do with 
the hacking.'

Some Twitter users mused over how the official Burger King account could have been hacked.

One
wrote: 'The fact that @BurgerKing got hacked and turned into a 
@McDonalds feed is pretty funny. Never know what is going to happen in 
social media.'

Another said: 'We're guessing the @BurgerKing social media team is having a bad day...'
