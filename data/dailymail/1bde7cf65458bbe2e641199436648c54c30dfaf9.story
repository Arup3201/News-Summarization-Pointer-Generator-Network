A Bronx man was arrested Wednesday after forgetting $2,500 worth of heroin in a rental car.

Carlos Tavarez, 30, rented the Chevy Cruze in Manhattan on Saturday and told Budget employees he planned to drive up to Boston and back.

At some point he returned the car to the Budget at Newark Airport, but soon called the location back claiming to have left his child's medication in the car.

Busted: Carlos Tavarez, 30, accidentally left 250 bags of heroin in a rental car when he returned it at Newark Airport this week. He was arrested trying to retrieve the stash on Wednesday

Loot: Port Authority Police seized 250 bags worth $2,500 in the illegal drug

By then employees had already found a 'suspicious' black plastic bag in the dashboard fuse box.

They called Port Authority Police who discovered the bag contained 250 bags of 'Fat Boy' heroin.

Tavarez was called back to retrieve the bag on Wednesday, where he filled out a lost-and-found form claiming the bag as his own.

That's when undercover Port Authority Police arrested him and charged him with possession of heroin and suspected sale of heroin.

He is being held at Essex County Jail on $150,000 bail.
