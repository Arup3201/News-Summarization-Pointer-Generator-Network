This is the moment a terrified mother and daughter were saved by a stranger from the roof of their car after getting trapped in rising flood waters.

Mother Stephanie Liddick, 25, and daughter,
 McKenna, 6, pulled over their car when intense hail and rain in Lakewood, Colorado, on Tuesday meant driving had become dangerous.

The hail and other debris clogged a nearby drainage gate, resulting in a flash flood 
that swept the family's car away with them inside.

Terrifying: The mother can be seen grasping on to her daughter as she sits on the roof of the sinking car

Assistance: Builder Merle Cordova rescued the family and took them to the safety of a nearby school in his truck

The mother's 2012 Nissan Versa was soon submerged in about four ft of rainwater.

Miss Liddick told Fox 31: 'The car started taking on 
water. I was okay for a minute.

'Then, it rose seat high and started 
filling the cup holders.

'We didn’t have a choice. We had to get out of the car.'

The mother managed to get her daughter on to the roof while she perched helplessly on the window.

Thankfully, builder Merle Cordova was nearby and stepped in to save them, capturing the rescue on his mobile phone.

Cordova said: 'She was waving at me and then I realized all that water flows down to a lake.'

'I originally went in nose first, but too much water was coming in the truck.

Saved: The mother and daughter were thankfully fine and have thanked their 'hero' for saving their lives

'Amazing guy': Merle Cordova, left, went to work in his wet clothes after saving Stephanie and her daughter

'So, I turned around and backed in and it let me hold onto my truck while I grabbed them.'

After rescuing the two, the hero dropped 
them off at a nearby school to get warm.

Then, he came back and towed Miss Liddick's car out of the street before going to work in his wet clothes.

The family have thanked their good Samaritan, saying he is an 'amazing guy'.

The horrifying event comes after days of heavy rainfall across Colarado.

President Barack Obama signed an emergency declaration Thursday night, 
freeing federal aid and allowing the Federal Emergency Management Agency
 to coordinate disaster relief efforts.

It is thought that some of the flooding was exacerbated by wildfire 'burn scars'.

Rain is normally soaked up by a sponge-like layer of pine needles and twigs on the forest floor, but wildfires have incinerated that layer.
