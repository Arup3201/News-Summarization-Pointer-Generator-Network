The trial of a veteran charged with fatally shooting former U.S. Navy SEAL Chris
Kyle was postponed on Monday due to
an ice storm that hit Texas.

Closing arguments had been expected to start this week but will now come shortly after the trial resumes on Tuesday, followed by jury
deliberations.

With temperatures set to hover around 20F all week, there are fears the trial will be pushed back even further. 

Eddie Ray Routh, 27, is accused of killing Kyle, the hit man whose life was the inspiration for this year's Oscar-nominated movie American Sniper. 

Postponed: The closing arguments in Chris Kyle's murder trial were postponed after an ice storm hit Texas

Workers were out in force clearing the streets in the hope that proceedings can resume on Tuesday

Delayed: There were hopes that the jury could be sent out to deliberate this afternoon or tomorrow 

Stephenville, Texas, where the trial is being held, was coated with a light dusting of snow and ice

Prosecution attorneys claim Routh shot Kyle and Kyle's
friend Chad Littlefield multiple times at a gun range about 70
miles southwest of Fort Worth in February 2013 before fleeing in Kyle's pickup truck.

The defense team is trying to have Routh declared innocent
by reason of insanity.

A psychiatrist called by the defense
testified last week that Routh had paranoid schizophrenia and
showed signs of psychosis that could not be faked, media reports
said.

Prosecutors, who are seeking a sentence of life in prison
without the possibility of parole, said Routh was aware of what
he was doing and called a psychologist who testified that Routh
does not meet the state's legal definition of insanity and had
been faking schizophrenia.

Chris Kyle, a former Navy SEAL and author of American Sniper was allegedly shot to death by Routh

The trial has focused renewed attention on Kyle, who is
considered by many in his home state of Texas a hero, and on the
movie American Sniper, which was nominated for six Academy
Awards, including best picture.

Routh, who served with the U.S. Marines in Iraq and Haiti,
had been admitted to Veterans Affairs hospitals after his
service to treat mental illness.

His attorneys have not disputed that he shot Kyle and
Littlefield. In videotape provided by police and shown in court
in the rural Texas city of Stephenville, Kyle admits to the
shooting in a rambling speech that defense attorneys contend
attests to his unstable mental state.

Prosecutors contend that Routh was a heavy drug user who
smoked marijuana dipped in formaldehyde before shooting the pair
and cannot escape blame for his actions due to his drug use.

Routh reportedly wanted to meet with Kyle's parents, Wayne and Deby (above), so he could apologize to them

Taya Kyle, the wife of the murdered former Navy SEAL, has been in court watching the murder trial on Friday

Tribute: Mrs Kyle was invited to the Oscars on Sunday and took to the red carpet with her husband's tags
