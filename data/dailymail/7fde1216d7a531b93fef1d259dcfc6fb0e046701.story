Death rates at a children's heart unit in Leeds did not hit the threshold to trigger an NHS safety alert, it has been revealed.

But two other centres, Alder Hey Children's 
Hospital in Liverpool 
and Evelina Children's Hospital in central London, also came close to the limit, according to the figures,
which cover the years 2009 to 2012.

Surgery at Leeds General Infirmary's child cardiac unit was halted at the end of last month after NHS England said it had 'serious concerns' that data showed the unit had a death rate double that of other centres. It resumed again on Wednesday.

Mortality rates for all children's heart surgery centres in England have been released following the temporary suspension of operations in Leeds

Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool also came close to the threshold that would trigger an NHS safety alert

NHS England medical director Sir Bruce Keogh has said he could not 'sit on' data about high death rates without doing something about it and insisted the closure was not a 'knee-jerk reaction'.

Data released by NHS England shows that none of the country's ten centres breached thresholds for child heart surgery deaths, but Leeds General Infirmary came 'very close' to the alert threshold.

The analysis was compiled by the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research, based at University College London, which oversees NHS mortality data.

Analysis accompanying the figures said: 'These findings do not indicate a "safety" problem in any centre.

'However, centres with three-year outcomes approaching the alert threshold may deserve additional scrutiny and monitoring of current performance.

'By definition, around half of all units will have more deaths than "expected".

'It is therefore inappropriate to label centres as "blameworthy" for these deaths, as the analysis does not show a significantly increased mortality rate.'

Professor Roger Boyle said he would not allow his daughter to be operated on in Leeds

A spokesman for Alder Hey Children's NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We are pleased to learn that all children's heart units in England, including Alder Hey, are safe.

'Alder Hey undertakes rigorous scrutiny of all our outcomes for this service, including an independent review of any deaths that sadly occur, in order to ensure that we have the safest, highest quality service for some of the most vulnerable infants and children in the country.'

Yesterday, a senior National Health Service executive declared he would not want his daughter treated at the crisis-hit child heart unit in Leeds.

Professor Sir Roger Boyle spoke out only days after the centre reopened after it was shut at short notice because of data he leaked on its comparative death rates.

Sir Roger, who now oversees NHS death rate data but was national director for heart disease until 2011, told Radio 4 that care at Leeds was ‘on the edge of acceptability’.

The father of a ten-year-old daughter, Amy, and three grown-up sons, he said: ‘I tell you that I have a young daughter, I would go somewhere else. I would go to Newcastle.’

His comments will alarm parents and enrage supporters of the unit at Leeds General Infirmary. They want him to be sacked, accusing him of ‘conducting a cynical vendetta’.

Paediatric heart surgery at Leeds was suspended at the end of last month after data leaked by Sir Roger appeared to show death rates running at twice the national average.

Surgeons at other units also raised concerns and parents told of children who were lucky to be alive.

But others claimed the closure was politically motivated as it came just 24 hours after the High Court quashed plans to close the centre as part of measures to streamline children’s heart services.

Sir Bruce said he now 'disagreed' with Sir Roger. ‘Having reviewed the unit, having reviewed the data, the performance in Leeds is in keeping with good national standards and I would be very happy to have my child operated upon in Leeds.'
