Three really is a magic number for one family - because their latest addition was born on her mother and grandfather's birthdays.

Newborn Phoebe Chadwick was born on Sunday, 12 days earlier than her expected arrival.

Her mother Natalie, 29, and great-grandfather Eric Bell, 85, also have their birthdays on March 3 and the trio, from Leeds, West Yorkshire, plan to celebrate their special day together in future.

The shared birthdays are even more remarkable because the probability of the feat occurring is only 1 in 48,627,125.

To try to work out how likely it is that three people will share the same birthday, we have to assume that there is an equal probability of being born on any one day of the year.We have to also assume that there are 365 days in a year, not 366 as if it were a leap year.With three people and 365 days, the equation looks like this:1* (365 x 365 x 365) = a 1 in 48,627,125 likelihood of the three birthdays landing on the same day.Probability is given as a value between 0 - that it will not happen at all - and 1, that it will happen.For three people having the same birthday, the probability is 0.00075 per cent - an extremely small probability.

Mrs Chadwick, 29, already has three sons with husband Luke - Oliver, seven, Rhys, six and one-year-old Riley.

The former student midwife, who hopes to return to her studies, said: 'Phoebe was due on March 15 but with her being my fourth baby they had to induce her early.

'I had contractions for two days and she finally arrived on Sunday, my birthday and my grandad's.

'Although it wasn't the nicest way to spend your birthday, it is all worthwhile now she is here safe.'

Natalie's mother Sue Gaunt said the family were thrilled with their newest member.

She said: 'It is wonderful news and most unusual for them all to have the same birthday.'
