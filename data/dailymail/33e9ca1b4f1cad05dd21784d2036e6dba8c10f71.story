Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy views his successor Francois Hollande as a ‘ridiculous little fat man who dyes his hair’, it emerged today.

The vicious attack is reported by l’Express, the highly respected Paris news magazine whose editor is a close friend of Mr Sarkozy’s third wife, Carla Bruni.

Barely disguised hatred between the two politicians has been well documented, but this is the first time that Mr Sarkozy’s bitter language has been reported in public.

According to the magazine, Mr Sarkozy told a friend: ‘You’ve seen him, this ridiculous little fat man who dyes his hair. Do you know men who dye their hair?’

Mr Sarkozy, a 58-year-old conservative, was roundly beaten by the portly Socialist, who is also 58, in last year’s presidential election.

When Mr Sarkozy was head of state Ms Bruni put him on a fitness programme aimed at making him leaner, fitter and younger looking.

Before that Mr Sarkozy, who is only 5ft 5ins, was himself mocked for being a chubby little man.

He continued to wear platform heels, and to surround himself with smaller men in an attempt to look taller, but lost a great deal of weight through constant work-outs and giving up chocolate.

Mr Hollande, in contrast, has failed to 
lose the tubby image which has seen him nick-named Flanby, after a 
custard pudding popular in France.

Mr Hollande has also made an effort to lose some pounds, and his hair has got noticeably darker over the last few months.

Like Mr Sarkozy, he has a younger partner – his girlfriend is 48-year-old divorcee Valerie Trierweiler – and is only too well aware of how important it is to maintain a dynamic image.

Mr Sarkozy infamously collapsed while out jogging during his presidency, and only managed one term in office.

He was widely disliked by millions of voters, and within a few days of losing his presidential immunity from prosecution saw the house he shares with Ms Bruni raided by anti-corruption police.

Mr Hollande is fairing equally badly as his tax-and-spend policies create economic disaster for France.

Opinion polls already reveal that Mr Hollande is the most unpopular president in the history of the Fifth Republic, with Mr Sarkozy a close second.
