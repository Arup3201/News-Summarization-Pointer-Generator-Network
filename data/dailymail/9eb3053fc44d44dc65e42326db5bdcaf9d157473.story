World AIDS Day initiative has received a colourful sign of support from the flagship Apple store on Sydney's George Street.

The iconic logo was illuminated late on Sunday evening, the first store to mark the start of the 24-hour (RED) initiative which will take place in Apple stores all over the world. 

(RED) has been operating in partnership with the global tech giant since 2012 and aims to raise awareness and spread hope of an AIDS-free world.

As Monday rolls into different time zones, the Apple logo will light up in cities such as Japan, Hong Kong, China, Europe and the United States, reported Mashable. 

The (RED) initiative was founded in 2006 by U2 frontman Bono and Bobby Shriver with the aim of using 'a simple idea that transforms incredible collective power as consumers into a financial force that saves lives'. 

'Apple isn't just in the fight to end AIDS. They are setting a new bar for business, giving US$75 million and counting to the Global Fund as part of their partnership with (RED),' said Bono in a statement.

Every product sold in Apple stores or online on Monday will support the initiative, helping fight the global spread of AIDS, and for a week from the 1st of December, 100% of proceeds from 24 apps will go towards the initiative.

'Apple is a proud supporter of (RED) because we believe the gift of life is the most important gift anyone can give,' said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO.

'For eight years, our customers have been helping fight AIDS in Africa by funding life-saving treatments which are having a profoundly positive impact,' he said.

'This year we are launching our biggest fundraising push yet with the participation of Apple’s retail and online stores, and some of the brightest minds in the App Store are lending their talents to the effort as well.'

Apps with (RED) content include as Angry Birds, GarageBand, The Sims FreePlay, Bubble Witch 2, Cut the Rope 2, CSR Racing, Clash of Clans, FarmVille 2, and Despicable Me: Minion Rush.

(RED) initiative is passionate about making medicine available to HIV-positive mothers to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the disease. 

650 babies are born with HIV each day, a staggering number which the initiative hopes to significantly decrease through education and research. 

The mission statement explains that to 'ensure that we get the number of babies born each day down from 650 to near zero, 1.4 million pregnant women with HIV will need to get lifesaving treatment at a cost of around 40 cents a day.'

'(RED) was designed to kick-start a steady flow of corporate money into the Global Fund to help make this possible.' 

(RED) has forged partnerships with other global brands such as American Express, Converse, Gap, Emporio Armani, Hallmark and Motorola to create products sold to raise funds for the initiative.
