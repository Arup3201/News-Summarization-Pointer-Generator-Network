TeamGB hockey player Hannah Macleod said tonight it was a 'huge relief' that her stolen Olympic bronze medal has been recovered.

The 2012 medal was one of two, belonging to Miss Macleod, 28, and rower Alex Partridge, 31, which were taken along with their TeamGB jackets as they partied at a London nightclub in the early hours of Wednesday.

Scotland Yard said today that it had been posted anonymously to the England Hockey head office at Bisham Abbey in Buckinghamshire.

Returned: Hockey player Hannah Macleod has got her bronze Olympic medal back after it was stolen from a nightclub but posted back anonymously today

Miss Macleod will have to wait to be reunited with her medal though, as it is being kept by officers investigating the theft.

She said she was extremely pleased 
that it had been found and thanked everyone who had helped publicise the
medals' disappearance.

'I am indebted to everyone who has 
tweeted about it, everyone who has got in touch and who has publicised 
the situation,' she said.

'I can't thank you enough. I think all of you played a part in encouraging whoever had my medal to return it.

'Given the huge impact the Olympic 
Games has had on London and the UK, I always held hope that it would be 
returned but it's still incredible to know now I have my medal back.

Still waiting: Alex Partridge, who won bronze at London 2012 as part of the men's eight rowing team, had his Olympic medal and blazer stolen while celebrating in Mayfair after a reception at Buckingham Palace. His blazer has since been handed into police

'People understand how much these 
medals mean to the athletes and those in the communities who have played
their part in supporting us.

'I'm conscious that the police 
investigation is still ongoing and that Alex Partridge's medal is yet to
be returned and I urge whoever has it to return it too.

'Once again, I'd like thank everyone who has played a part.'

However, rower Alex Partridge's bronze has not been returned yet, which was also taken in the same incident just hours after they celebrated with the Queen at a special reception at Buckingham Palace.

Detective Chief Inspector James 
Harman said: 'We are still looking to recover the second medal, and we 
stress that our inquiries remain active.

'Our appeals for information stand and I take this opportunity to reiterate them - if the public can help we ask them to do so.

Unattended: The athletes left their jackets, with their medals inside, unattended at the Mahiki Nightclub in Mayfair, central London

'Alex's medal has yet to be traced, and he is understandably keen to be reunited with it as soon as possible.'

Ms
Macloed, 38, has not been reunited with her medal, the Met said, who 
plan to give it back to her later and in a statement, the force said: 
'The medal is being retained by police at this time as part of our 
inquiries, though we look forward to reuniting Hannah with her medal 
shortly.

'She has of course been kept fully informed.'

A spokeswoman added: 'We have got it now and will be giving it back to her when we can.'

The Olympians took
to Twitter to report that their medals were missing after they 
celebrated at Mahiki - a club popular with celebrities and also Royalty 
like Prince Harry.

Mr
Partridge's Olympic blazer, which also went missing, has since been 
handed into a north west London police station, but Hannah's has not.

Royal thanks: The medals were stolen after the reception where the Queen met and congratulated successful Olympians and Paralympians including Hannah Cockcroft who won two gold medals at the Paralympics

A
31-year-old man is being held at a west London police station in 
relation to the investigation, a police spokesman said yesterday.

Mr
Partridge, 31, who won bronze as part of the men’s eight rowing team, 
posted on Twitter yesterday: 'To the chap who took my @London2012 
Olympic Blazer & Medal last night The police have u on CCTV Please 
return it to 6 Lower Mall Hammersmith.'

Ms
Macleod, 28, who won bronze in the women’s hockey, also wrote on the 
social networking site: ‘My medal was also stolen at the same time. 
Totally devastated.’

Both athletes published a photo of a 
man captured on CCTV who they believe may have something to do with the 
theft although it is not known whether he in fact had any connection.

Ms Macleod’s tweet of the photo has 
gone viral, having been re-tweeted more than 17,000 times since she 
posted it just 11 hours ago.

She posted: ‘Had my Olympic medal stolen. Do you recognise this man? Please RT to help get my bronze medal back.’

Police are appealing for information after the athletes left their jackets unattended, with the medals inside them, were taken.

The CCTV image that was posted online had not been released by 
the police, a Metropolitan Police spokesman said but detectives are currently analysing CCTV from the venue.

Detective Chief Inspector James 
Harman said: 'I would appeal to anyone who was in the venue in the early
hours of Wednesday and saw anything suspicious to contact us - any 
information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, could prove vital 
to this investigation.'

The 
reception at Buckingham Palace was a chance for Her Majesty to say thank
you and congratulations to the athletes for their brilliant display in 
the London Games.

The Queen
and Philip first welcomed Prime Minister David Cameron, Health 
Secretary Jeremy Hunt - formerly Culture Secretary - and other senior 
figures who made the Games possible, including Lord Coe, former chair of
London 2012, in the Palace’s 18th Century Room.

The athletes arrived in their official Team GB formal wear of suits, which included a special inside pocket for their medals.

Another
Olympian used Twitter to share her experience of the event. Silver 
medallist Gemma Gibbons posted a photo of the royal water closet on her 
Twitter page to share with her 29,000 followers.

Flushed with pride: Gemma Gibbons also took to Twitter at the event, posting a picture of a Buckingham Palace toilet she took while attending the special reception on her Twitter page

She wrote 'Met the queen today, she has very posh toilets!', followed by a #howtheroyalspee.'

She said: 'I tweeted it without thinking, really, and I really hope that I’m not in trouble. It was such a lovely event that I wouldn’t want to end up in the Tower.’

Fortunately for Miss Gibbons, Buckingham Palace officials were very much amused. ‘We are just glad that our guests have a wonderful experience – wherever they might be in the palace,’ said a smiling aide.

Team GB began the summer’s medal rush by winning 65 in total, including 29 golds, an achievement that was hailed as the athletes’ 'greatest ever' performance by Andy Hunt, their chef de mission for London 2012.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Westminster CID on 020 7321 7650 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
