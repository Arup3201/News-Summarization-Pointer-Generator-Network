This shocking video has emerged of a Ukrainian motorist dodging artillery blasts by seconds after at least 30 people were killed in a rebel shelling attack.

Filmed on dashcam footage and dated January 24, the clip was posted online yesterday and claimed to have been recorded in the southeastern city of Mariupol.

And it shows the reality of everyday life in the crisis-hit country.  

This shocking clip of a motorist narrowly avoiding a blast emerged a day after dozens were killed in Ukraine

Filmed on dashcam footage and dated January 24, the clip purporting to be Mariupol was posted online yesterday

It starts as the car is driving through what appears to be a residential area.

Suddenly, terrifying screams are heard and a large blast is seen nearby. Another shell hits the street, which the driver avoids by seconds.

But a vehicle in front is hit and disappears into a cloud of smoke.

The driver comes to a stop and fragments of debris are seen approaching the windscreen - before the car quickly reverses away.

Yesterday, it was reported that at least 30 people were dead - including a 15-year-old girl and a five-year-old boy - and 83 injured after pro-Russian rebels shelled Mariupol a day after the separatists rejected a peace deal signed last year.

Indiscriminate rocket fire from long range GRAD Missiles struck a market, two schools, homes and shops according to the regional police force.

The rocket fire had come from rebel-held territory, the Organisation for Security and Co-Operation in Europe said, as NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called on Russia to stop supplying arms to the separatists.

The Ukrainian president called the blitz a terrorist attack and NATO and the U.S. demanded that Russia stop supporting the rebels.

President Petro Poroshenko cut short his visit to Saudi Arabia to call an emergency meeting of his military officials, to coordinate the government's response. 

Ukrainian officials rushed to defend the strategically important port on the Sea of Azov, beefing up military positions with more equipment and sending in more forces. 

The separatists' top leader declared that an offensive against Mariupol had begun — then later toned down his threats as the scale of the civilian casualties became clear.

Mariupol mayor Yuriy Khotlubei said: 'The area that came under attack was massive.

'The shelling was carried out by militants. This is very clearly Russian aggression that has caused terrible losses for the residents of the eastern part of our city.'

It is thought the attack in Mariupol was payback for the explosion which killed 13 people in the rebel-held eastern region of Donetsk on Thursday

Despite international calls for a ceasefire, the separatists' leader Alexander Zakharchenko has vowed to push on with a new offensive and expel Ukrainian troops from the eastern region entirely.

It is thought today's attack was payback for the explosion which killed 13 people in the rebel-held eastern region of Donetsk on Thursday. 

And last weekend, battles intensified over Donetsk airport, which has been reduced to rubble after months of fighting. 

The UN has estimated that 5,100 people have been killed as a result of the conflict since April last year.

More than 30 people lost their lives, including a five-year-old boy and a girl, aged 15, and 83 were injured
