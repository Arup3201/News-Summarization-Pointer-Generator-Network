Senior Tory MPs demanded that the government publish a damning report into the £50 billion High Speed Rail project yesterday after the Mail revealed ministers are trying to suppress it.

Conservative Vice Chairman Michael Fabricant broke ranks and warned that failure to come clean about the project would fuel ‘growing mistrust about HS2’.

He spoke out after it emerged that Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin and Cabinet Office Minister Francis Maude have called on David Cameron to veto the release of the report, which found that HS2 was a ‘red/amber’ project in danger of failing, under Freedom of Information laws.

Documents leaked to the Mail show that they plan to take the extraordinary step of using a veto usually deployed in cases of national security - because they fear the ‘political and presentational difficulties at a crucial point in the HS2 project’s development’.

Mr Maude and Mr McLoughlin told the Prime Minister: ‘We consider that the importance the Government attaches to the successful implementation of the HS2 project ... justifies the use of the veto in this case.’

Mr Fabricant, who left the Tory whips office at the last reshuffle so he could campaign against HS2, told the Mail the report, drawn up in November 2011, should be released in full.

‘I understand that the study is a little out of date but in my view it is foolish to withhold it,’ he said. ‘It only fuels the growing mistrust of HS2 among the public.

‘I would strongly argue that the report should be released, with a health warning that it is not up to date. More recent reports should also be released whether they show a green, an amber or a red light.

‘HS2 legislation has got to the stage in the timetable where it is unstoppable. It is like the proverbial runaway train which, if it is not careful, will derail with everyone careering off the track with it.’

Steve Baker, the MP for Wycombe, said: ‘I’m very concerned about this. I’ve been opposed to HS2 since I came into Parliament. I’ve always thought the business case was weak and I certainly think the fullest possible information should be made public.

‘This project will change the landscape of our country, both the topographically and economically and socially. An decision should be made with the fullest possible information.

‘Ministers claim it will usher in a new great age of the railways but it bares no comparison with the Victorian era since that involved private investors risking their own money and this is the Government risking taxpayers’ money.’ UKIP

Deputy Leader Paul Nuttall described the episode as an example of ‘shoddy politics’.

‘The Project Assessment Review should be published, and it should be published now,’ he said.

‘The fact that we have Cabinet Ministers seeking to block this report on HS2 demonstrates the cloak and danger approach the government is taking to this whole project and transparency in general.

‘Rather than being open, frank and honest about the many potential difficulties that HS2 is going to face, the government are seeking to bury that bad news. It is shoddy politics.’

Senior government sources Cabinet Secretary Maurice Frankel of the Campaign for Freedom of Information pointed out that the veto has only previously been used to veto publication of Cabinet discussions on the Iraq War and other matters, to prevent disclosure of Prince Charles’s letters to ministers and a Department of Health risk register on NHS reforms.

He said: ‘This case is interesting because the leaked letter talks not just about the principles of good government, it talks about the veto in terms of political presentation.’

He warned that excessive use of the veto would undermine the rule of law. ‘Vetoing means that ministers don’t have to argue their case at a tribunal or in court.

It completely overturns the normal relationship between politicians and the law. I’m sure ministers would like to ignore the law and the courts in all sorts of cases but here they actually can.’

Sir Jeremy Heywood wants publication blocked because it would ‘create a precedent’ that would mean further Project Assessment Reviews would have to be released as well.

HS2, whose £50 billion cost includes £7.5 billion for the high-speed trains, has a first phase which runs from London through Tory heartlands in the Chilterns to Birmingham which is due for completion in 2026.

Richard Houghton, of the HS2 Action Alliance, said: If HS2 is going to deliver the vast economic benefits that are claimed for it, there would be no need for ministers to hide behind Parliamentary process, they would happily share documents like this.’

A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ‘We do not comment on leaked documents.’
