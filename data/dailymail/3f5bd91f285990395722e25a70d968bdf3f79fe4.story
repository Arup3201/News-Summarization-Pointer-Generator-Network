The owner of Obie, the formerly obese dachshund, is being investigated by the charitable activities section of the Oregon Attorney General's Office.

Obie, who lives in Portland, Oregon, with owner Nora Vanatta, had previously tipped the scales at whopping 77lbs and to get him down to his target weight Vanatta appealed for donations.

Money donated online funded specialty diet food for Obie, skin-reduction surgery, an exercise regime and legal bills to fight off a custody battle for the six-year-old.

But since January, the agency has been investigating how Vanatta used the funds and where she is donating the remainder.

Vantatta, who adopted Obie after he was nearly fed to death by his doting elderly owners, told of the investigation on her Facebook page this week: 'Recently, someone filed a complaint with the Oregon State Attorney General's office because I accepted financial gifts on Obie's behalf.

'The Oregon AG contends that, by stating publicly that I would donate the funds over and above Obie's medical needs and the custody suit to recognized 501(c)3 organizations, I misrepresented myself as a charity and misled the folks who supported Obie with financial gifts.

In her post Vanatta details how the dispute was settled after four months but 'unfortunately, the settlement came at a price: over $15K of Obie's money was used to fight a frivolous lawsuit'

'This, the AG further contends, is proven by the reference to said gifts as "donations."

'This saddens me more than I can adequately express.'

Soon after Vanatta adopted Obie he became the subject of a bitter custody battle with the Oregon Dachshund Rescue – the agency that coordinated with Vanatta to transfer Obie from the relative's custody to her home.

They accused her of exploiting the dog for 'sensationalistic promotional value' and began fighting for custody.

She writes: 'Many of you have purchased Obie's calendars. 

'Again, I am grateful to you because the revenue from the calendar sales helped pay the $11,800 for the attorney who negotiated the settlement with the AG.'  

She finishes the post: 'The bottom line: the Oregon AG conceded that no wrong doing was found and I may keep a small amount of your gifts to put toward Obie’s future care, but the balance is to be either sent to the State, or to recognized charities that they approve.'

Vanatta had hoped to send the money to animal rescue efforts and other owners which need to pay for surgery for their animals.

Vanatta put Obie on a strict feeding regimen, which resulted in Obie losing 40lbs by May 2013

The Attorney General began looking into the matter after receiving complaints and was focusing on how Vanatta was representing her use of the funds, spokeswoman Kristina Edmunson said reports Oregon Live.

She said the agency is working on a final agreement and declined to disclose further details as the investigation continues. 

The story of the grossly overweight six-year-old pooch went viral last year when social media sites lit up with photos of a miserable-looking Obie lying on his back with his enormous belly chaffed from being dragged on the ground. 

Vanatta put Obie on a strict feeding regimen, which resulted in Obie losing 40lbs by May 2013.

But the pup didn't stop there, continuing to shed pounds over the summer to reach his optimal weight.

The pooch also had to undergo a cosmetic surgery to remove several pounds of loose skin from his now-svelte physique.

In September, the rambunctious canine had to go under the knife again for an unrelated operation to remove cotton Obie apparently had been snacking on.

Obie's numerous fans have been following his progress ever since the first pictures of Obie were posted on Facebook.

The dog was so overweight that he needed to wear a special harness to prevent injury to his bulging stomach and chest.  

A dachshund normally has a maximum weight of 32 pounds and Obie is now down to a healthy 22 pounds.
