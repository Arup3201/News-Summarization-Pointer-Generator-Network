Cleared: Oil and banking heir Matthew Mellon was accused of hacking ex-wife Tamara Mellon, the Jimmy Choo tycoon

Law firms were revealed last night to be the single biggest user of corrupt private detectives who hacked, blagged and stole private information.

They made up a fifth of 102 companies and groups uncovered as clients of a network of investigators jailed last year.

MPs released a detailed break-down of the secret list outlining how 22 law firms paid for their shady services.

The disclosure will fuel the growing clamour for companies and individuals linked to the so-called blue-chip hacking scandal to be named publicly.

Scotland Yard and the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) have been accused of protecting  corporate clients and celebrities uncovered in their inquiries.

Members of the Home Affairs Committee are concerned that those who paid others to steal and blag information have escaped the same scrutiny as the media.

They are also angry that the Government has failed to regulate and license the thriving, but little known, private detective industry.

Speaking last night, Keith Vaz, who chairs the committee, said he is determined to name those involved as soon as possible.

The senior Labour MP met Soca director-general Trevor Pearce yesterday and told him he is ‘concerned’ that the list is classified.

He said releasing the number of firms in each category is an ‘important step towards establishing the facts’.

He added: ‘It is in the public interest 
for the information to be available at the appropriate time, not for 
this saga to drag on.’

The breakdown revealed that a huge range of firms and individuals paid for the services of the group of private investigators.

Following law firms, the next largest group was fellow private investigators (16), followed by insurers (ten) and financial service companies (eight).

A string of other white collar professions linked to them include accountants, auditors, debt collectors and even an oil and medical supply company.

Two celebrities are among the names, as well as seven other individuals seeking sensitive information about others.

Scotland Yard holds the names of five further companies and individuals that it has been investigating since late 2011.

Calls: Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has also been asked to release suppressed information from four investigations into rogue private detective agencies

The suspects are under scrutiny as part of Operation Tuleta, an offshoot of inquiries into phone hacking and the bribing of public officials for information.

The BBC’s flagship radio news programme finally turned its attention to the secret hacking scandal yesterday – at 6.36am when not many would be listening.

The four-minute item was the first mention by the Today programme despite weeks of newspaper reports of how shady private eyes hacked, blagged and stole information.

The Daily Mail and other newspapers have raised serious concerns that little has been done about the criminal activities of private eyes commissioned by major companies.

Despite revelations in recent days that 102 companies featured on a list given to MPs by the Serious Organised Crime Agency, the story has merited barely a mention on BBC radio and TV programmes or online.

It contrasts with the blanket coverage given by the BBC to revelations of phone hacking in the media.

Yesterday, the London force confirmed those in the spotlight are ‘outside of the media industry’ as it defended its refusal to identify them.

A spokesman said the ‘live investigation’ could be endangered if the names were released.

Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has also been asked to release suppressed information from four investigations into rogue private detective agencies.

Tory MP James Clappison, who made the request, is particularly interested in a 2007 inquiry known as Operation Barbatus.

It found private eyes of one firm dubbed ‘Hackers Are Us’ were hacking computers and corrupting police officers but no clients were successfully prosecuted.

The only one to be charged was oil and banking heir Matthew Mellon who hired the company during divorce proceedings against his ex-wife Tamara Mellon, the Jimmy Choo tycoon.

Mr Mellon was later cleared by a jury who accepted he had no idea the investigators to whom he paid £12,000 were breaking the law.

In a separate development, the Mail can reveal that ministers will shortly unveil the first ever statutory licensing regime for private detectives.

At present, there is nothing in law to distinguish companies that pursue legitimate business activities from ‘corrupt operatives’.
