A shocking video has emerged of a circus worker dancing on the back of a dying elephant while it bathes in a river.

The film shows Madi - a 48-year-old Indian elephant - slowly drowning as the circus owner's brother jumps around on her in a pair of swimming shorts as she sinks under the surface.

Horrified witnesses made the 40 minute video when Madi - from Germany's Universal Circus Renz - was taken to a river to bath during a tour of Estonia.
