Fernando Torres has officially begun life as an AC Milan player, pictured in his first training session for the Italian giants.

Torres, who has joined Milan on a two-year loan deal from parent club Chelsea, seemed to be fitting into his new surroundings on Wednesday as he took to the field with his new team-mates for the first time.

The Spanish striker, who has made 110 league appearances for Chelsea since joining the west London club for £50 million in January 2011, has fallen out of favour with Blues boss Jose Mourinho and was shipped out on loan last week for the remaining two years of his contract.

Upon joining AC Milan last Friday, Torres said of the move: 'I feel good, mentally strong. When everything goes well, you have more will power. I'm happy to train.'

'I can't wait to see the red and black supporters, to score for them and to win many titles.'

Torres will wear the number nine shirt for his new club, something the now-Milan man knows has a lot of history.

'It's an honour to wear the number nine jersey. (It) has been worn by some of Milan's great champions, I hope to be up there with them.' 

After a disappointing three years at the Bridge, Torres will now have to prove his worth once more. Milan finished 8th in Serie A last season, and should Torres help them better that this season, he will surely be on his way.
