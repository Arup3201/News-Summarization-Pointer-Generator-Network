The early morning commute, the late drudge home and the chaotic public markets - these are some of the everyday moments illustrated in a photo competition capturing the day-to-day reality of working life.

The overall winner of this year's CBRE Urban Photographer of Year competition was Marius Veith. His picture, called Mask of Society, shows a woman arranging jewellery in a shop window in Germany next to a decorative gold mask.

Mr Veith said: 'Street photography has been a passion of mine for many years and I knew my ‘Mask of Society’ image was the perfect shot for the competition’s ‘Cities at Work’ brief.

'I’m constantly looking for new and interesting angles of urban life and its constantly changing landscape never fails to challenge me.'

This year's theme 'Cities at Work' challenged photographers to find the most captivating images possible to illustrate the reality of the day-to-day working life. 

Contestants were asked to submit photos capturing the essence of 'cities at work', be it 'poignant, inspiring, quirky or amusing', with one prize category being the Hourly Winners - a series of 24 images compiled to illustrate the hour of the day at which they were taken.

Other entries included workers weaving threads together at a Vietnamese fishing net factory, a traffic officer dancing as he directs vehicles on the streets of Lisbon and the solitude of the final train home in Tokyo.
