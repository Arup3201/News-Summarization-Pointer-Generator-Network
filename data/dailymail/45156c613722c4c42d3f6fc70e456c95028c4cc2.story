A disgraced St John's University dean who hanged herself this week after being accused of embezzlement left several suicide notes inside her Queens home promising never to forgive the school where she had worked for three decades.

One of the notes left by 59-year-old Cecilia Chang at her Jamaica Estates home indicated that the dean believed the Catholic university had scapegoated her.

'You're cruel,' she wrote in Manadarin in one of the missives.

In another note, the contents of which were revealed to the New York Daily News by a source, Dr Chang said: 'i fee very painful. I want to die. I want to be with my parents.'

In her final moments, the 59-year-old
dean of St. John's Asian studies turned her thoughts to her lawyer son,
Steven, writing that she would always love him and apologizing to him. 

Another source told the Daily News 
that Dr Chang, who faced 20 years in prison if convicted, was unhappy 
with her attorney. She apparently attempted to take her life twice 
before her Tuesday suicide.

Following her Monday court 
appearance, the 59-year-old mother of two reportedly tried to slash her 
wrists and gas herself in a fireplace.

Dr Chang committed suicide after she 
went on trial for embezzling $1million and forcing students to work as 
her servants, it was claimed on Tuesday.

Chang’s legal troubles started when an anonymous letter written in Chinese was sent to St. John’s board of trustees, detailing her purported wrongdoings.

The school had conducted an audit and alerted the Queens District Attorney's Office, which incited her for alleged embezzlement, bribery, tax evasion and making false statement to the FBI.

Chang's rambling testimony on Monday has revealed that she had misappropriated school funds and spent the money on gambling, online dating services and items from Victoria’s Secret.

The dean also implicated two university presidents, including the current head of St John’s, the Rev Donald Harrington, who allegedly received custom-made suits from Chang. 

The 59-year-old, known among her 
students as the 'Dean of Mean,' was found dead in her Jamaica Estates 
home one day after she testified at her own trial and denied taking 
money from the university.

Dr
Chang was also reportedly the prime suspect in the 1990 murder of her first 
husband, Ruey Fung Tsai, who was shot three times in the back by an unknown assassin.

According to the New York Post, law enforcement sources discovered her body at her home about 7.30am on Tuesday.

She had been on house arrest since she was first charged with the crimes.

A member of Chang's legal team knocked on her door Tuesday morning, the Post reports, to pick her up for court, got no answer and smelled gas.

Authorities were called, broke into the home and discovered her body.

A source told the New York Daily News she hanged herself from a folding ladder leading to the attic after she had also slashed her own wrists.

On Monday, she had taken the stand at her trial and said she was innocent of allegations that she forced her students to wash her underwear by hand and cook her meals.

The judge presiding over the case had her responses stricken dozens of times as she refused to answer with simple yes or no, instead giving lengthy answers.

Federal Judge Sterling Johnson Jr, called her death a 'Shakespearean tragedy.' on Tuesday after he was told of her suicide.

'Dean of Mean': Dr Chang earned a reputation for treating her students like indentured servants -- making them cook for her and do her laundry

Despite a mountain of evidence that 
university money had been transferred to foreign bank accounts, Dr Chang
repeatedly pleaded ignorance in court Monday.

When asked why she told police that 
she didn't have money in foreign bank accounts -- even though records 
show she had $200,000 stashed in Hong Kong -- she claimed that she had 
forgotten about that account because she had been drinking before the 
police interview.

She said she also forgot about $40,000 she had in another account.

Dr Chang said her students cooked meals for at St John's Asia Studies Center -- but only because the students prepared food for everyone who stayed there.

She said students had washed her laundry -- but only rarely.

Former students of the program had testified that they felt like indentured servants because they were afraid they would lose their scholarships if they refused to do work for her.

The New York Daily News also reports that detectives investigated Ms Chang in the murder of her husband. From his death bed, Mr Tsai reportedly wrote 'My wife did this!' when questioned by detectives.

He was shot four times in the back while leaving his business in Brooklyn, New York, in 1990. He died says later and no one has every been charged in his death.

Tsai's note also suggested that Dr Chang had an affair with Queens Borough President Donald Manes, a neighbor who killed himself in 1986 after being caught in a scandal.
