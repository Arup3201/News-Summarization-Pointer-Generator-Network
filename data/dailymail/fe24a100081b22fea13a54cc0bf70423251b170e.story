Anderson Cooper has revealed that he will not be inheriting any money from his wealthy mother, Gloria Vanderbilt.

The heiress-turned-jeans designer and perfume developer is the great-great-great-granddaughter of the railroad tycoon Cornelius Vanderbilt.

Gloria, who is now 90-years-old, has an estimated personal wealth of about $200million but her youngest son Anderson is not expecting to get any of that when she dies.

Cool mom: Anderson Cooper said that his mother Gloria is 'the coolest person I know' and he is totally accepting of her plans not to leave him any of her fortune as an inheritance (seen together in 2010)

'My mom's made clear to me that there's no trust fund. There's none of that,' the CNN anchor told Howard Stern on his radio show.

'I don't believe in inheriting money... I think it's an initiative sucker. I think it's a curse.

'Who's inherited a lot of money that has gone on to do things in their own life? From the time I was growing up, if I felt that there was some pot of gold waiting for me, I don't know that I would've been so motivated.'

The 46-year-old journalist makes a reported $11million per year as a result of his CNN contract.

He lives in a multi-million dollar converted firehouse in New York City's Greenwich Village and also has two neighboring Hamptons homes.

Moving away from wealth: Gloria inherited money from her family's railroad fortune but Anderson (seen right with his mother, now-deceased brother Carter and father Wyatt in 1972) said that he chose to pay more attention to his father's humble beginnings

'I'm doing fine on my own, I don't need any,' he said.

During the radio interview with Stern, cooper maintained that he was totally accepting of the deal with his mother, telling the incredulous host that he has no idea what she will do with her money.

Gloria has struggled with her finances in the past, and sued her lawyer for $1.5million after he swindled money from her in 1993.

She had to sell her seven-bedroom mansion in the wealthy resort town of Southampton as well as her five-story Manhattan townhouse in 1995 in order to pay off backtaxes.

She moved in with Anderson at that point, when he was living in a two-bedroom apartment.

Her fortune quickly returned in 2002 when she formally sold her company, Gloria Vanderbilt Apparel Corp, to Jones Apparel Group for $138million in 2002. She has also written three books since the mid-1990s and continues to run gallery openings and create her own artwork.

In the Howard Stern interview, Anderson went on to say that he does not know how much is in his own personal savings account, but he tried to stay humble growing up by focusing more on his father's family than his mother's.

Money earner: Cooper, 46, said that he makes enough money on his own that he is not concerned about an inheritance

'I've never paid attention to it honestly like my dad grew up really poor in Mississippi- I paid attention to that because i thought thats a healthier thing to pay attention to than like some statute of a great great great grandfather who has no connection to my life,' he said.

Anderson's father, Wyatt Emory Cooper, was Gloria's fourth husband and he died in 1978 from a heart attack when Anderson was just 9-years-old.

Wyatt was 50 at the time of his death, and Anderson said that the looming big birthday is a fear of his, prompting him to start eating better.

'Yeah I think I have like three years left,' the 46-year-old said.

Stern went on to bring up the controversy surrounding Alec Baldwin and his use of homophobic language last year which prompted a reprimand from Cooper via Twitter.

In subsequent interviews, Baldwin blamed part of the backlash on Cooper saying that the openly gay journalist was ‘the self-appointed Jack Valenti of gay media culture’ but Cooper used the radio interview as a chance to both stand by his earlier assertions and support the scandal-trodden actor.

‘I like Alec Baldwin, I think he’s incredibly talented, I think he’s incredibly smart,’ Cooper said while clearly taking a nervous term.

‘When he called the person a cocksucker, and then said he didn't know “c*******er” was an anti-gay — I mean, what adult does not know calling a guy a “c*******er” (is an insult).

‘The worst thing you can possibly think of to say, which is what this situation was, to talk about a sexual act between two guys as being the worst thing you can possibly think of. That seems to indicate— but I never said he was homophobic. I have no idea what's in his head.’
