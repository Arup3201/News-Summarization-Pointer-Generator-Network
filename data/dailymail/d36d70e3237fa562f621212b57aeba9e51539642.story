A 45-year-old mother-of-five, who has had two of her children as a result of IVF, and two via surrogacy, was stunned to find herself pregnant by natural means in April, following a 20-year battle with fertility.

'After two decades without a spontaneous conception; after countless ovarian stimulation cycles, multiple intrauterine insemination and more than five IVF attempts... I was pregnant - the old fashioned way,' Carolyn Savage writes of her discovery for Today.com.

And not only has the Ohio mother suffered several miscarriages in the past, she has even given birth to another couple's child, when, six years ago, doctors accidentally 
implanted her with the wrong embryo during an IVF mix-up. Mrs Savage made worldwide news when she agreed to carry the child to full term anyway, and then reunite him with his biological parents.

Mrs Savage, who is now almost 15 weeks pregnant, and husband Sean, 44, have been having unprotected sex for the duration of their 21-year marriage, and have only conceived naturally once, 20 years ago; so Mrs Savage could hardly believe it when she saw the results of her home pregnancy test a few months ago.

She 'immediately' raced to her computer to Google 'pregnant at 45,' and was met with a wash of gloomy statistics.

'Some of the sites reported miscarriage rates as high as 90per cent for a woman my age,' she writes. 'I told Sean later that night and followed the news up with the sobering statistics and the warning, "This probably won’t last."'

As the couple anxiously 'waited' to lose their baby, time progressed and Mrs Savages' routine examinations flew by without a hitch.

Agonizing road: Mrs Savage and her husband Sean, 44, (left) had eldest son Drew, 19, (center left) naturally, followed by Ryan, 17, (center right) and Mary Kate, six, (center) by IVF, and twins Isabella and Regan, three (in red) via a surrogate

'Finally, at 15 weeks, we received the results of our cell free DNA study: Our baby was chromosomally typical, and he is a boy,' she reveals.

'I’ve left the morbid state of waiting to miscarry and moved onto a happier, more confident - but not cocky - place.'

Already a mother-of-five, Mrs Savage's first son Drew, 19, was her only naturally conceived child, followed by a heart-breaking series of miscarriages and complicated pregnancies over the years.

Her next eldest son Ryan, 17, was a result of IVF, as was her daughter Mary Kate, six. Her following IVF pregnancy was in 2009, this time when her fertility clinic mistakenly implanted her with the embryo of another couple, Shannon and Paul Morrell.

Knowing how much this baby was wanted, Mrs Savage made the life-altering decision to carry the child, Logan, now six, to full term and reunite him with his parents.

She writes that she loved Logan as her own and still 'thinks and prays for him' every day.

Because Mrs Savage suffers from a pregnancy-related condition called HELLP syndrome, which can cause life-threatening pre-eclampsia, she was told while carrying Logan that her uterus was simply unable to carry any more children.

'I’ve left the morbid state of waiting to miscarry and moved onto a happier, more confident place'

So in 2011, Mrs Savage and her husband used a surrogate, nurse Jennifer O'Nash, to birth their twin girls, Isabella and Regan, now three, and settled happily with their 'happy ending' - a brood of five.

Now, in an unexpected twist, the thrilled couple looks set to have their sixth child in the same manner as their first, completely naturally, closing a two-decade long loop with a discovery that Mrs Savage aptly describes as: 'The stuff of fairy tales.'
