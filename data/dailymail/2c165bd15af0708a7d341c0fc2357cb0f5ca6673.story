Candice Swanepoel, certainly a woman of many talents in the looks department, has revealed she has another, lesser-known trick up her sleeve.

'I am very good at pretending that I am not nervous!' admits the 25-year-old Victoria's Secret Angel.

And you'd hardly guess the self-confessed 'shy' model was ever short on confidence, judging by her latest stunning bikini spread for Marie Claire.

The blonde bombshell, who seems to 
practically live in swimwear when she's not on the red carpet, poses on a
 (perhaps chilly) Miami beach in which she dons a selection of coats, 
towels and wraps.

Miss Swanepoel, who looks as lovely as ever draped in jewelry with windswept hair, clearly takes her prized role as a Victoria's Secret Angel very seriously, nervous or not.

'It comes with a different kind of responsibility,' she explains. 'It’s not just about posing for shoots. People know your name and your personality.'

She also opened up about her childhood hobby: ballet, and how it later informed her career as a professional-beautiful-person.

'It has helped a lot with modeling because I think about all parts of my body, from my fingers to my toes,' she says.

Miss Swanpoel has spoken previously of her affections for the challenging dance form, telling V Magazine in 2011: 'I had been dancing from a very young age. My mom was a dancer too, so it was something that bonded us.

I loved the discipline and elegance of ballet, and the training has helped me so much.'

In fact, she tells Marie Claire that if she hadn't become a blindingly successful model, she'd probably have continued with ballet, 'or maybe I would have become a veterinarian,' she muses.

Quite a leap from what she told the magazine in an interview last year, when she said she would 'definitely' have been a make-up artist, but a girl is entitled to change to mind.

Miss Swanepoel grew up on a farm in her native South Africa, and was discovered by an agency scout at the age of 15, while shopping at a flea market with her mother.

She has been with her boyfriend, Brazilian model Hermann Nicoli, throughout her sky-rocketing career, ever since they met in Paris in 2005 when she was only 17 years old.

Miss Swanepoel earned her Angel wings in 2010 and has been a firm favorite of the lingerie giant ever since, counting fellow South African Angel Behati Prinsloo and Dutch beauty Doutzen Kroes as some of her closet friends.

She appeared last month at the brand's Bond Street store in London, alongside marketing director Ed Razek, where they announced that its 2014 fashion show will cross the pond from its previous home in New York to the British capital on December 2.

Miss Swanepoel currently lives between New York and Brazil with Mr Nicoli and their two jack russells, Milo and Luna.
