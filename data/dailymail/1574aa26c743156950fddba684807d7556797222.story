Prince Harry certainly isn’t short of a few friends.

But his Whiskey Mist chums might have a new recruit to their clique, as the royal was seen getting on famously with racing legend Sir Jackie Stewart during the Grand Prix.

The former Formula One racing driver, nicknamed the ‘Flying Scot’ for his success on the circuit, seemed equally delighted to talk to the Prince.

looks interesting: Prince Harry appears to be listening intently to Jackie Stewart

Stewart and Harry chatted over cars during the races at the famous Silverstone Circuit in Northamptonshire earlier today.

They watched Lewis Hamilton attempt to beat his Mercedes rival Nico Rosberg and win the British Grand Prix.

After
 watching England's dull 0-0 draw with Costa Rica at the World Cup just 
two weeks ago, Prince Harry was no doubt hoping for more excitement in 
this sporting event.

But regardless of the race’s outcome, he was clearly having a superb time talking to legendary Stewart.

Someone's happy: Prince Harry appeared to be having the time of his life at the Grand Prix this weekend, where he was seen chatting to racing legend Jackie Stewart and watching Lewis Hamilton race

They were spotted wandering around behind the scenes at the famous track and walking through the paddock, deep on conversation.

racing wisdom, as he gestured toward a racing car and Harry looked on 
intently.

Harry then lent in closely as Stewart talked in his ear during the loud races.

The Prince, 29, was also seen laughing and smiling, clearly engaged in Stewart’s conversation and with the races themselves.

Stewart competed in Formula One between 1965 and 1973, winning three World Drivers' Championships.

Also spotted at the high profile races this weekend were Michael Fassbender, Stuart Broad and Yohan Blake.
