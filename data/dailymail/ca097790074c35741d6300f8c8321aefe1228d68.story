Israel has destroyed the home of a Palestinian who ran over and killed two people in Jerusalem last month just days after militants killed four rabbis and a policeman at a synagogue in the city.

The east Jerusalem home of Abdel-Rahman Shaloudi, 21, was blown up before dawn, the Israeli Defence Force said.

The decision to destroy it is likely to further inflame tensions that are already on a knife edge after a spate of clashes between Palestinians and Israelis in the wake of this year's two month war in Gaza. 

Shaloudi was shot dead by police as he tried to flee after mowing down commuters at a light railway stop on October 22.

Violence in Jerusalem and other areas of Israel and the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories has surged since July when a Palestinian teenager was burned to death by Jewish assailants, an alleged revenge attack for the abduction and killing of three Jewish teens by Palestinian militants in the occupied West Bank.

Israel's army has blown up or demolished militants' homes for decades but stopped the practice in 2005, saying it was counterproductive. However, court-sanctioned demolitions resumed earlier this year. 

The move to destroy his home was condemned by Philip Luther, Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa Programme Director.

He said: 'Punishing the families of suspects by destroying their homes is collective punishment and is prohibited by international law.

'Tensions across the West Bank have been at fever pitch following the conflict in Gaza this summer. 

'Authorities must not trample over the rights of Palestinians through collective punishments and other heavy-handed measures in order to restore security.'

Tuesday's attack at a Jerusalem synagogue where the four rabbis and a policeman were killed was the worst in the city since 2008 when a Palestinian gunman killed eight people at a religious school. 

Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed revenge on the Palestinians responsible for the attack on the Jerusalem synagogue, pledging to demolish the homes of the men involved.

Speaking just hours after the attack, he said he would 'settle the score with every terrorist', claiming those who wanted to force the Israeli people out of Jerusalem would not succeed.

He said: 'We are in a battle over Jerusalem, our eternal capital.'

Tensions have deepened in Silwan and other areas of Arab East Jerusalem in recent months, with almost nightly clashes between Palestinians throwing rocks and setting off firecrackers and armed Israeli police firing stun grenades and tear gas.

The unrest has grown since the July-August war in Gaza and the movement of dozens of Jewish settlers into Silwan in recent weeks.

A push by Orthodox Jews to be allowed to pray at an Old City site that is holy to both Muslims and Jews, in defiance of a decades-long ban agreed by Israel, has also fuelled anger.
