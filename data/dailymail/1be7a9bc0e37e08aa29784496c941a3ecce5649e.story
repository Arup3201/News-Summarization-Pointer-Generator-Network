The mother of a 10-year-old Pennsylvania girl who was shot dead in the head by an intruder who blindly fired through her font door was awaiting trial for allegedly selling crack, it was revealed Tuesday.

Police say Shantye Brown, whose daughter Taniyah Thomas was shot and killed before dawn Monday, sold crack cocaine to an undercover informant.

While police in the city of Washington are stopping short of saying that's why the apartment was targeted, Thomas's grandfather thinks the incident was undoubtedly drug related.

Tragic: Shantye Brown lost her daughter in the predawn hours Monday when intruders blasted through their front door with a gun, hitting 10-year-old Taniyah in the head. It was revealed Tuesday that Brown (left) was awaiting trial for allegedly selling crack to a police informant, but police haven't said drugs were a motive

Sherman Brown, told CBS News that he blames the mother’s live-in boyfriend, who has drug-related convictions in 2011 and 2013.

Police say Taniyah's mother was arrested on the drug charges in January.

'Why would they come to somebody’s house and break in and then go to shooting? She was an innocent girl and got shot and died. And that’s terrible. I’m just so upset,' Sherman Brown said.

Police say a 10-year-old girl was 
asleep in her family's apartment when she was woken up by the sound of 
gunshots in the middle of the night.

Washington
 County Coroner Tim Warco says Thomas was shot in the head at about 3:50
 a.m. Monday at her home about 20 miles southwest of Pittsburgh.

Washington
 police Detective Daniel Stanek says the girl, her mother, her mother's 
boyfriend and a baby were asleep when the shots were fired through the 
apartment door.

Taniyah died of a head wound about 30 minutes later at Washington Hospital.

Not the target: The shooter or shooters reportedly blasted through the from door of the Washington, Pennsylvania building and later did the same to Taniyah's apartment door but never entered the home

Heartbroken: Taniyah's grandfather says he believes the shooting was drug related and said he blames Shantye's live-in boyfriend, who was home but unscathed

Police say the shooter didn't enter the apartment. They also say it isn't clear whether more than one suspect was involved.

During
 a Monday news conference, police said whoever fired the shots kicked in
 a bottom level door to get access to the building. They then traveled 
upstairs, where the shots were fired.

Investigators
 said Taniyah likely woke up scared after hearing the gunshots and tried
 running to her mom’s room, where she was shot.

Taniyah’s grandfather said she loved cheerleading and was an innocent bystander to terrible violence.

Killed: Washington police Det. Daniel Stanek says the girl, her mother, her mother's boyfriend and a baby were asleep when the shots were fired through the apartment door. Taniyah died of a head wound about 30 minutes later

'You
 don’t shoot kids. I can see you killing a grown-up or doing something 
that did something to you. You don’t mess with young kids. Why? They 
never did anything you,' Brown told WPXI.

'I
 just took her last Wednesday to her cheerleading and she was supposed 
to go tomorrow to Pittsburgh for a competition. Now she can’t go.'

No one else was hurt in the shooting.

A fund has been set up for anyone that would like to contribute cash donations for the funeral of the little girl at GiveForward.com.
