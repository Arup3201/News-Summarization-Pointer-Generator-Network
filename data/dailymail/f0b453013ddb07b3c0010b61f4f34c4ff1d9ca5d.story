A Kentucky teenager was killed in his home after trying to protect his mother from her estranged boyfriend, and the woman was abducted and later found dead in Ohio during a multistate police search, a sheriff said Friday.

The suspect, Terry Froman, 41, of Brookport, Illinois, was taken into custody in the Cincinnati area and faced murder and kidnapping charges back in Kentucky, said Dewayne Redmon, the sheriff in Graves County in western Kentucky.

The suspect was taken to a hospital to be examined, Redmon said.

Mother: Kim Thomas, Mahoney's mother was reportedly abducted by estranged boyfriend Terry Froman

Froman's vehicle was stopped by Ohio authorities, who found 34-year-old Kim Thomas dead inside, the sheriff said.

According to WHIO, Froman had shot himself. 

Thomas 'was found naked and bloody, and likely was shot multiple times,' the affiliate station reported. 

Earlier Friday, authorities found the body of her 17-year-old son, Michael Mahoney, in the front part of their home in Mayfield, Kentucky, Redmon said. There were signs of a struggle, he said.

'What we believe, apparently the son intervened and tried to protect his mother, and it cost him his life,' the sheriff said.

The teenager suffered multiple gunshot wounds, and an autopsy was scheduled, said Graves County Coroner Phillip McClain.

Michael Mahoney attended Mayfield High School. Students formed prayer circles after learning of the tragedy, and grief counselors and youth ministers were brought to the school, said school district spokeswoman Kim Hamby.

Kentucky authorities were tipped off when a bloodied Thomas was seen trying to flee from a vehicle at a food mart in Paducah, Kentucky, Redmon said.

Froman caught her, put her back in the vehicle and fled, he said.

That prompted the multistate police search that included the vehicle's license plate and descriptions of the man and woman inside, Redmon said.

Ohio authorities spotted the vehicle in the Cincinnati area and stopped it, he said.
