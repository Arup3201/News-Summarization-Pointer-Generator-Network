Proving that age really is just a number - and that it is never too late to adopt a healthy lifestyle - a new generation of  grannies are pushing their bodies to the limit by undertaking the ultimate endurance runs.

Shunning more traditional OAP hobbies like knitting and baking, these tenacious older women are putting the youth to shame by competing in extreme ultra-marathons - known to be some of the hardest tests of physical and mental endurance in the world.

One such grandmother, 77-year-old Andjelina Andjelic - also known as Serbia's Supergran - regularly runs ultra-marathons of 100 km each.

'I hope I will still be running at the age of 100!' says Andjelina Andjelic who, at 77-years-old runs ultra-marathons of 100 km each

The Belgrade-bomber, as she is known to her friends, only took up running at the age of 55 when she thought that it was time that she 'started to live a little bit more healthily.'

Since making that decision she has pounded her way through 100 pairs of trainers and competed in such celebrated urban races as the New York, Rome and London marathons.

'I first started to run 100 metres to see if I even could do that. Then I went for 200, 500 and after a while I participated at race of 5,000 metres', she said. 'Sometimes I have to ask the organisers not to pack up and go home before I cross the finish line.

'I am a bit slower than many, but I always make a point of completing a race.

'The most gruelling I recall was 111 kilometres, but it took me 24 hours', said Andjelina, adding that she runs for health and fun, not for results - although it remains a fact that she has won 35 different medals.

'Some even don't believe it when I say I am a granny", she said. 'I think they expect me to sit at home and knit, or something.

Mimi, 51, from Kent, only took up running at 36 but has still managed to break records in the sport, and this weekend will face another grueling challenge as she competes in the 250 km Desert Ultra marathon

The grandmother has previously ran the Badwater ultra marathon in Death Valley twice in a row

'But there is nothing like the wind in your face and the adrenalin pumping through your body to make you feel good. I hope I will still be running at the age of 100!'

Another Supergran who is racing into the the record books is Mimi Anderson, 51, from Kent.

The grandmother to Theo, aged five, and Finley, two, only took up running at 36 but has still managed to break records in the sport.

Having suffered an eating disorder in her youth for 15 years she says it was taking up running at the age of 36 that gave her the incentive to battle the condition.

She has won numerous world records for her endurance feats including the fastest crossing on foot across Ireland (345 miles in three days, 15 hours and nearly 37 minutes) and the furthest distance covered on a treadmill by a female over seven days.

This weekend Mimi will compete in the Desert Ultra, a 250km super marathon set in the dry heat of the Namib Desert.

The race is self-sufficient meaning Mimi will be carrying all of her kit and equipment for the entire race, which includes a sleeping bag, food, safety equipment and a minimum of 2.5 litres, while running in extreme heat.

Despite the monumental task ahead of her, Mimi says on her blog that she is excited about the challenge.

'I canâ€™t tell you how excited I am to have the opportunity to run once again in such a stunning location, with the added bonus of all the wild life we will see; so close sometimes you could almost touch them. 

'My pink camera is charging and ready to go!  One of the reasons I began running in the first place was to see amazing Countries like Africa,' she says.
