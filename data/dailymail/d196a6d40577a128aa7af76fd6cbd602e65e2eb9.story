Radio 4 listeners could be forgiven for thinking they had tuned in to the wrong station this week. 

Instead of the usual round-up of the day’s politics, they were confronted by a graphic discussion of pornography and sex.

To replace Today in Parliament, which is off air during the summer recess, the BBC aired the first instalment of a ten-part series called Summer Nights, featuring explicit discussions of swinging, orgasms, and sex toys.

And the broadcaster caused further outrage with a 15-minute drama, aired at 10.45am, which focused on a married man who discovers he is gay by using pornographic websites.

Listeners complained the scheduling was ‘completely inappropriate’ yesterday, branding Summer Nights a ‘porno You and Yours’ after the station’s regular consumer affairs programme.

Opening the show, at 11pm on Monday, Woman’s Hour presenter Jane Garvey told listeners it would be different to their usual fare, saying it would contain a ‘frank discussion of sex and sexual behaviour’.

She added: ‘If that isn’t what you want to hear now then you can switch off and re-join Radio 4 at midnight for the news.’ 

An ‘expert’ panel – including a ‘sex activist’ and a psychotherapist – then began discussing masturbation and sexual positions, while drinking red wine.

One panellist claimed people experience pleasure during rape while another described violent sexual fantasies. Listeners were also given a detailed account of what to expect in a ‘vanilla’ porn film – with Susie Orbach, 66, explaining how the women would be ‘waxed’ before sex.

The psychotherapist then described a sex craze among young people called ‘mag and bag’ in which a woman’s face is covered during sex while her partner looks at a woman in a magazine instead.

Benedict Garrett, a self-described ‘sex activist’ branded pornography ‘democratic’. The 33-year-old, who also works as a male escort and stripper, said: ‘Porn democratises the human body way more than any mainstream media does.

The BBC received four official complaints about the programme and listeners took to Twitter in outrage, calling it 'awful'

‘In the sense that if you type into a Google search engine disabled porn, porn with fat people, porn with midgets, porn with people who are missing a limb, you can find it.’

He went on to discuss his work as a prostitute, saying he had once slept with a 40-year-old virgin and giving details of what sexual positions they had tried.

The BBC received four official complaints about the programme and listeners took to Twitter in outrage, calling it ‘awful’.

One wrote: ‘Driving home at 11pm listening to Radio 4 as usual … but it’s all about sex! Shocking – don’t they know we’re British!’ Another added: ‘I don’t want them to discuss sex on Radio 4 any more than I want to discuss it with my mum.’ 

The BBC was also criticised for airing the drama How To Have A Perfect Marriage at 10.45am on Radio 4 despite its adult content.

The short play featured a  wife who discovers her husband uses the internet to procure gay sex. The character also finds out her mother has bought Viagra for her father.

One listener, Jean Howell, said: ‘This content is totally inappropriate for this time of the morning and I had to turn the radio off so the little ones in my house did not get upset … Do the producers of these programmes not have children? There should be a watershed on radio for adult content.’ 

The drama received five official complaints. A BBC spokesman said programmes were ‘commissioned and scheduled with audience expectations in mind’.

He added: ‘The Woman’s Hour drama often tackles challenging issues and Summer Nights is a late night discussion programme covering numerous topics – and in both instances the nature of the content was clearly flagged to listeners before broadcast so that they could decide whether to continue listening.’
