Rory McIlroy and Sergio Garcia put a smile back on the face of the game on Friday as the pair turned in a glorious exhibition at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational.

Open Champion McIlroy shot a fabulous 64 but still couldn’t keep pace with the man he beat at Hoylake, as Spanish renaissance artist Garcia created something of a masterpiece with an amazing course record-equalling 61, including seven birdies in a row to finish. Garcia also birdied the 10th to come home in a remarkable 27 strokes.

‘I have been fortunate enough to have some low rounds in my career but none as low as this,’ said the 34 year old.

‘This was the best one of all.’

Delighted: Sergio Garcia leads the way after a course record-equalling 61

Indefinite: Johnson will miss the season's final major and Ryder Cup after admitting he needs professional help

In form: Rose is seeking his third win in just four starts after another impressive display

The second round had begun amidst the
 murky clamour created by the spectacular downfall of Dustin Johnson, 
who announced on Thursday he was taking an indefinite leave of absence 
from the game to tackle some ‘personal challenges.’

All
 that disappeared to the back of the mind thanks largely to McIlroy and 
Garcia but also to two more wonderful ball strikers – Justin Rose and 
Rickie Fowler.

What a 
third round we have in prospect on Saturday, with Rose joining McIlroy 
and Garcia in the final threeball after following up his opening 65 with
 a 67. Garcia leads by three from Rose with McIlroy four off the pace 
and Fowler five behind.

McIlroy
 was playing in the group behind Garcia and admitted he had gained 
motivation watching the latter hole putt after putt. ‘I was playing 
really well but thinking to myself if I didn’t make a few birdies I was 
going to be too far behind him going into the weekend,’ said the 25 year
 old. ‘Fortunately I was able to do that and it was great to finish with
 two in a row.’

As for 
Rose, he is in prime position to notch his third win in his last four 
starts. ‘You scored well but didn’t play well,’ was the verdict of 
Rose’s coach Sean Foley after the first round. This time, it was the 
other way round as Rose struck the ball so well even a three under par 
effort felt scant reward. ‘I guess it all evens itself out in the end,’ 
he said.

Tiger Woods is seven off the pace and just outside the top 20 
after a nondescript 71.

In contention: McIlroy lies in joint third after a impressive display so far

Back on track: Woods is slowly but steadily getting his game back on track after back surgery

All of which did much to erase the shock created by Johnson with his stunning announcement on Thursday. 

On
 the practice ground and outside the ropes at Firestone, on websites and
 all over social media, they’re certain they know what caused the sad 
demise of Johnson.

Players
 get a three month suspension for a violation of the tour’s anti-doping 
policy concerning recreational drug use. With Johnson declaring himself 
ineligible even at this stage for the Ryder Cup at the end of September,
 people have drawn their own conclusions.

There
 remains no hard facts, however. The PGA Tour name players guilty of 
taking performance-enhancing drugs but not recreational, while Johnson’s
 statement simply fuelled the speculation.

Whatever
 the truth, there will no doubt be many who feel the need to condemn a 
man whose party lifestyle appears to have caught up with him.

The
 prevailing mood here, however, remains an obvious sadness at the fall 
of someone who appeared to have everything; someone so gilded that even 
fellow members of the elite speak in awed tones about his gifts. No 
golfer aged 30 or under has won more times on the PGA Tour than Johnson.

‘When
 Dustin is on his game and firing on all cylinders, there really isn’t 
an awful lot that most of the rest of us can do to stop him,’ said 
Graeme McDowell, following a vain pursuit at the HSBC Champions 
tournament in China last November.

Zach
 Johnson – no relation - couldn’t stop shaking his head in sympathy when
 asked about his namesake. ‘It stinks,’ he said, repeatedly.

The
 other Johnson’s name has been discreetly removed already from the Ryder
 Cup qualification list, with brash American Patrick Reed now moving 
into the last available slot. He is in good shape to move up still 
further following rounds of 67 and 68.

Thomas
 Bjorn and Jamie Donaldson are both in the top 20 as they seek to cement
 their Ryder Cup place but struggling English trio Lee Westwood, Luke 
Donald and Ian Poulter are well off the pace once more after rounds of 
71, 70 and 73 respectively.
