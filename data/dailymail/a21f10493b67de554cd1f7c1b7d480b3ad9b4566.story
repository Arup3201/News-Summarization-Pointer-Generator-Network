She's no stranger to a sharp suit thanks to a lengthy career in journalism and Queen Letizia certainly knows how to style one.

Chic in a navy suit enlivened with a cerise top, Letizia was every inch the royal style icon as she toured the Valle Del Cicados Institute in Calahorra.

Never one to be left behind in the style stakes, husband King Felipe, 46, also opted for a splash of pink, teaming his dapper suit - also in navy - with a tie that was a perfect match for the colour of Letizia's top.

This isn't the first time the couple have been spotted in co-ordinating ensembles. Last week, the pair were seen touring a farm show dressed in matching grey suits and its not unusual to see Felipe match his tie to Letizia's dress.

Indeed, the couple welcomed the president and first lady of the Honduras to the Zarzuela Palace in Madrid on Wednesday wearing matching ensembles, with Letizia choosing a fuchsia dress and Felipe sporting a tie in the same shade.

Letizia has made a habit of wearing colours on the pink spectrum of late, choosing Felipe Varela dresses in similar shades for the Honduran presidential visit and for an evening engagement a day earlier.

Nevertheless, as she demonstrated today, she remains a fan of the neatly tailored Armani suits that became her trademark during her journalism career.

And the Spanish royal has had plenty of uses for her tailored wardrobe of late, courtesy of a busy schedule that has seen them travel all over Spain.

Today's visit, to Calahorra in the semi-autonomous region of La Rioja in northern Spain, was a case in point, with the couple meeting students preparing for a career in nursing during their tour of the Valle Del Cicados Institute.

The Institute, which is a further education centre, specialises in humanities and medical studies, with English, Spanish Literature, religion and music all on offer to students.

Many had been waiting outside the Institute to meet the royal couple, with both Felipe and Letizia obligingly posing for photographs in a repeat of last week's crowd scenes at the International Cattle Fair in Zafra, a town in south-eastern Spain.

There, despite looking less than impressed during a run-in with a bull and a frisky Andalusian horse, Letizia, 42, charmed the crowds and posed for selfies with well-wishers.

She also drew cheers when she stopped to pick up a little girl, plucking her from the crowd for a cuddle - much to the delight of her parents.
