Elsa Carneau, 25, was found face down in the swimming pool at Virgin Active in Kensington, West London

A former model who behaved in a 'bizarre' way before being found lying unconscious in a top-of-the-range health club swimming pool had been admitted to hospital twice that week after drinking too much alcohol, an inquest has heard.

City worker Elsa Carneau, a French 
national described as ‘very thin’ and ‘fragile' by one witness, was discovered face down in the water at Virgin Active in Kensington, London, on December 2011.

The 
inquest heard today how Miss Carneau, who had a history of fainting and alcohol problems, had collapsed twice in the days leading up to the tragedy.

She also passed out several times at work because of drinking too much, the inquest heard.

Two empty bottles of vodka were found in Miss Carneau's locker and post-mortem results showed she was more than twice over the legal drink-drive limit, the jury was told.

Pathologist Dr Simon Poole, who gave the
 cause of death as drowning, told the jury there was a smell of alcohol 
around Miss Carneau's body and that her liver was inflamed, which is in 
line with chronic alcohol dependency.

She also had traces of valium in her bloodstream, a tranquiliser also known as diazepam.

The inquest had previously heard from a swimmer who chatted between lengths with Miss Carneau and described her as 'euphoric'. She had been making 'bizarre' and 'strange' remarks, the jury had been told. 

But the inquest at Westminster Coroner's Court, which is being held at the High Court in London, heard how efforts made to revive Miss Carneau, who worked as an analyst, were hindered by one worker who 
filmed the unfolding drama.

Firefighter Ben Young told the inquest that a worker pulled out his mobile to record the scene as the swimmer lay dying in the water.

When Mr Young asked what he was doing, the worker - who has not been identified in court - replied it would be 'something to remember this by if she survived', the inquest was told.

Firefighters and paramedics tried to revive Miss Carneau for almost one hour after running to the scene from a nearby fire station, but she was pronounced dead after being taken to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital.

Mr Young said he noticed the worker filming the scene at the Richard Branson-owned health club when his team were carrying out CPR.

He said: 'He identified himself as staff. He had his mobile phone out filming, I grabbed the phone.

'He became quite aggressive and said I couldn't do that. I deleted the film. I said 'what are you doing?'.

'He said 'If she makes it she has something to remember this by' which I was quite astounded by.

'When I said I was impounding the phone he said 'you can't take my phone'. I found the video and deleted it.'

Brian O'Keeffe, watch manager at the Kensington fire station, said he asked Mr Young to take the phone off the man after the bright lights from the device distracted him.

He said: 'I was doing compressions and noticed a flash or bright light. I looked up and there was a member of staff filming us on his mobile phone. 

'It was a distraction and in my opinion illegal to interfere with the emergency services in this way.

'I asked him to stop and he didn't - he continued and I asked a member of my staff to get him to stop which he did.

'Firefighter Young took the phone, deleted the image and gave it back to him.'

The jury at Westminster Coroner's Court heard how a member of staff at the gym allegedly filmed her on his mobile phone as she lay unconscious

Paramedic Wendy King also told the inquest she noticed the man filming from the bridge above the pool and found it 'absolutely despicable'.

But she told coroner Kevin McLoughlin that she would not be able to recognise the person.

Today's session also heard from toxicologist Professor Atholl Johnston, who said there had been 181 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of Miss Carneau's blood. The legal limit is 80mg.

He said: ‘The alcohol had been taken quite recently and
 it takes some time before he alcohol gets into the urine.

‘The levels in her blood were higher than in the urine which suggests she drank acutely and died soon after.’

Two empty vodka bottles were found in Miss Carneau's locker and the inquest heard her blood reading was twice over the legal drink-drive limit

The jury heard Miss Carneau also weighed just 8st 11lbs and had a Body Mass Index 
(BMI) of 17.5. The recommended minimum BMI figure is 18.5.

One witness, gym member Lily Ho, described her as ‘very thin’ and ‘fragile’ looking.

Dr Poole gave the cause of death as drowning, saying Miss Carneau's lungs were water-logged.

But he said the autopsy did not show what specifically caused Miss Carneau to drown.

He
 said the swimmer could have fainted in the pool, but there were no 
physical signs to prove that.

During the hearing, Dominic Kay, who represents Virgin Active in the inquest, said Miss 
Carneau was admitted to hospital twice that week after she collapsed from alcohol 
abuse.

She also passed out several times at work because of drinking too much, he said.

The inquest also heard concerns from firefighter Mr O'Keeffe about the methods used to try and revive Miss Carneau and the way staff handled the situation.

Mr O'Keeffe told the jury that members of the public who should not have been there at the time were either unaware of what was happening, or watching.

He also said the club's lead first aider Natalia Roman was not using the defibrillator 'competently', a concern which he reported to the fire service after the incident and said could have affected Miss Carneau's chance of survival.

He said: 'When I first went to the poolside there were a lot of people in the area and the same man who was filming became aggressive when I asked him to leave.

'He told me he was a member of staff. He just seemed to be looking in fascination at what was unfolding, he was transfixed by it. His reaction when I asked him to leave was quite disturbing.'

Mr O'Keeffe also believes the firefighters could have been called to the scene earlier, saying the health centre staff were 'overwhelmed' by the 'emotional situation'.

In a statement read at the inquest, Miss Roman said she rushed to the poolside after hearing the panic alarm.

She said: 
'I removed vomit from her face and rolled her so she could vomit then 
checked her airway to see if she was breathing. I noticed her stomach 
muscles in spasm.'

Another
 witness, fitness instructor Amy Johnson, said she and other staff 
members were sent to break into a number of lockers to find out Miss 
Carneau's identity after the hospital phoned asking for details.

It was there that they found a beige 
handbag containing ID and clothing, as well as ten Marlboro cigarettes 
and two small empty alcohol bottles.

Yesterday, the jury heard how Miss Carneau had made a series of ‘bizarre’ and ‘strange’ remarks to swimmers before the incident, including that she swam underwater as she found it peaceful.

Rupert Hill, 46, who works in finance in
 the City and was a member of the gym, said he had several conversations with Miss Carneau between lengths of the pool.

He later noticed Miss Carneau lying underwater, seemingly holding her breath.

When she did not surface for around a minute, he pulled her out of the water and onto the side and first aiders were called.

He said: ‘She seemed extremely exuberant in the way she was speaking. She made a couple of comments that were slightly strange.'

The jury was also shown CCTV footage of Miss Carneau getting in the pool in a red swimming costume at around 6pm on Saturday December 3, 2011.

She swam 23 lengths of the small pool, before getting out of the pool for 30 seconds, and then returning to swim two more lengths.

Paramedic Ms King said the ambulance staff did everything they could to try and save Miss Carneau, including intubating her.

She said: ‘It was a very difficult physical situation. There was so much water about which we were trying to clear but it was refilling all the time.

‘With all that and having to stop to shock the patient (with a defibrillator) it became a difficult thing to achieve.’

The inquest continues.
