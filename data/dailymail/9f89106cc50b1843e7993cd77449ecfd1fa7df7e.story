Mathieu Debuchy is expected to be out for two months after suffering an ankle injury in Saturday's draw with Manchester City at the Emirates Stadium.

Debuchy collapsed in clear agony after catching his studs in the turf and the defender has damaged ligaments in his left ankle.

The 29-year-old's injury means Arsene Wenger will bring Calum Chambers, the only back-up centre-half, in at right back.

Other defenders in the senior squad are left back Kieran Gibbs, just back from injury, and 19-year-old right back Hector Bellerin, yet to make a competitive start for Arsenal.

Wenger admitted Debuchy’s injury, in the 81st minute, hurt his team against City, who grabbed a point through Martin Demichelis's header two minutes later.

'We just switched off,' said the Arsenal boss. 'We did not look the same team. Not because of Chambers but we looked a bit lost.'

Debuchy joined Arsenal in the summer as a replacement for Bacary Sagna, who left to play for City, and had impressed with his performances so far at the Emirates.

Arsenal were on track for victory against City after man-of-the-match Jack Wilshere inspired a second-half fightback, firing a wonderful equaliser before teeing up Alexis Sanchez’s sublime volley.

But Demichelis rescued a draw from a pulsating match when he nodded Aleksandar Kolarov’s corner past Wojciech Szczesny in the 84th minute.
