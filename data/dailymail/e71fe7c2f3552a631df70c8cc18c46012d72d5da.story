A teenage mother and her friend have avoided jail after admitting to getting her toddler so drunk on vodka she could not stand, was vomiting and her eyes rolled back in her head.

Shadreon Jefferson, 17, was looking after her one-year-old daughter with Shamara Batiste, 24, at her home in TC Jester in Houston, Texas, when Batiste gave her some of her alcoholic drink.

The little girl drank the equivalent of six shots of vodka, before falling asleep, police said. The two women then dropped the child off at her grandmother's home, where she started vomiting.

After noticing the toddler also could not stand, was shivering and her eyes had rolled back in her head, her concerned grandmother called 911 and she was rushed to hospital.

There, she was found to have a blood alcohol content of 0.268 - more than three times the legal limit for adult drivers, according to KHOU.com. She was diagnosed with alcohol poisoning. 

Jefferson and Batiste were arrested following the incident on February 8 this year and charged with felony child endangerment. They both later pleaded guilty to the charge.

However, they have avoided jail after being sentenced to two years' probation (Batiste) and three years' deferred adjudication (Jefferson) respectively on Monday, ABC reported.

Scene: In hospital, the child was found to have a blood alcohol content of 0.268 - more than three times the legal limit for adult drivers. Above, the incident occurred at Inwood Village complex (pictured) in TC Jester

Case: Jefferson (seen in court earlier this year) and Batiste were arrested following the incident on February 8 this year and charged with felony child endangerment. They both later pleaded guilty to the charge

During a police interview, Batiste reportedly admitted she had given Jefferson's daughter some of her drink at the apartment at Inwood Village complex in the 7200 block of TC Jester, near Antoine.

She estimated the 23-month-old had consumed around half of her beverage - roughly six shots of vodka - before falling asleep. Police also noted Batiste 'laughed' when speaking about the incident.  

When the girl was taken to hospital, she was apparently swaying and smelled strongly of alcohol, according to KPRC. She has since recovered.

The toddler and two other children are now in the care of a relative.
