Mick Philpott has quit his prison job after just 35 minutes, it was claimed yesterday.

The child killer was handed a £14-a-week cleaning role - his first job for a decade - at the high security Wakefield Prison, West Yorkshire.

But after complaining about the work, he left his mop and broom and stormed back to his cell.

Philpott has just started his life sentence  after being convicted of six counts of manslaughter for killing his six children in a house fire he started deliberately.

Quit: Mick Philpott, pictured with wife Mairead, stormed back to his cell after giving up his first job for 10 years

The 56-year-old, described as 'disturbingly dangerous with no moral compass', has become a hate figure and, according to reports, has also been placed on a hit list by a group of travellers.

He conned them out of thousands of pounds when he appealed for cash to pay for the funeral of his children, it was claimed.

A source close to the Prison Service said the travellers, disgusted to discover Philpott was responsible for the fire that caused their deaths, want him taught a lesson.

In total, more than £15,000 was raised within the 
devastated community of Allenton for the service at St Mary's Catholic 
Church, Derby, with each casket carried on a horse-drawn carriage.

The travelling community also handed over thousands, it was reported.

But benefactors were rocked by claims 
that Philpott wanted the cash converted to Argos vouchers and intended 
to auction tributes, including teddies, placed outside his burnt-out 
home last May.

The prison source said Philpott is now a marked man.

The jobless father of 17, aided by wife Mairead, herself a member of the travelling community, and friend Paul Mosley, gambled with his own children's lives by starting the blaze at the family's three-bedroom semi.

He intended to frame former lover Lisa Willis - who was embroiled in a custody battle with him - and emerge a hero by rescuing those trapped inside the property.

He also wanted a bigger house. But the scheme went horribly wrong.

Jade Philpott, 10, and her brothers John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, Jayden, five, and Duwayne, 13, were overcome by smoke.

Mairead, dubbed little more than Philpott's chattel, and Mosley were both sent down for 17 years.

Mark Leech, editor of prisoners' newspaper Converse has visited Wakefield six times in the last 18 months.

Philpott's new neighbours include cannibal Robert Maudsley, who ate one victim's brains, Milly Dowler's killer Levi Bellfield and Roy Whiting, who murdered Sarah Payne

He said: 'He is going to find it very difficult in prison, not because he's a child killer - there are plenty of those at Wakefield, but because he tried to fit-up two innocent people.

'He has been condemned to a living hell spent looking nervously over his shoulder, I think this is inevitable because of the prison hierarchy.

'Mick Philpott is at the bottom of the pile, down there with child-killers, paedophiles and informants. Armed robbers are at the top. He is most at risk from the mentally unstable, who believe there is a warped sense of stature in scarring the killer.

'Some will select Philpott for trying to put others in the frame for his crime. There are people in Wakefield who are in denial over their offences. They will see people like him as being responsible for their convictions.'

Before being banged-up, Philpott confided to a friend that he feared being 'ripped apart' in a prison dubbed 'Monster Mansion' because of the psychopaths locked-up there.

His new neighbours include cannibal Robert Maudsley, who ate one victim's brains, Milly Dowler's killer Levi Bellfield and Roy Whiting, who murdered Sarah Payne.

Britain's most violent inmate Charles Bronson, who has moved prisons 120 times due to a history of attacks on staff and inmates, is also at Wakefield.

Soham murderer Ian Huntley was attacked twice there and serial killer Dr Harold Shipman hanged himself in a cell.

'It is a Category A prison,' said Mr Leech. 'When he is out of his cell, there will be two officers with him. When he moves out of the cell-block, there will be two officers and a dog-handler.

'His cell will consist of a TV, bed, toilet, wash basin, some books and toiletries. He will have a prison wage of £2.50 a week.

'Because of the security issue, he won't be able to go to workshops. Because of what he's done, he won't have the support of loved ones.'

Yesterday, a spokesman for Derbyshire Police said they were unaware of the threat to Philpott.

She said: 'We have had no information to suggest there is any tension or anger from the travelling community following the conviction of the Philpotts.

'Derbyshire Police hasn't received any calls or complaints from that section of the community.'

A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Justice said: 'We do not comment on individual prisoners.'
