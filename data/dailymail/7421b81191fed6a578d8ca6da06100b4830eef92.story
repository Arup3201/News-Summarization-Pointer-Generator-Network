Former workers at MG Rover are to receive compensation of just £3 each after fighting a seven-year battle for redundancy payments.

Campaigners fighting for more money for the 6,500 employees who lost their jobs following the collapse of Britain's last major car maker were told of the tiny payout this week.

When the firm collapsed in 2005, workers were told by the company's owners that millions of pounds would be available for them in a compensation fund.

Shocking: Former workers at MG Rover are to be handed compensation of just £3 each after fighting a seven-year battle for redundancy payments

But, as reported by The Guardian, the fund has instead just £22,000 which needs to be shared among the thousands of workers whose jobs were lost.

Following news of the payouts on Monday, campaigners are now calling for personal donations to the workers' fund from the 'Phoenix Four' – made up of John Towers, Nick Stephenson, John Edwards and Peter Beale.

The businessmen bought the company for just £10 in 2000 and then paid themselves and Kevin Howe, the managing director, a total of £42m.

A formal request for contributions to the fund has now been sent to representatives of the Phoenix Four.

Speaking to MailOnline, Oliver Thomas, a former Longbridge employee and founder of the Justice for Rover Workers group, said:

'Obviously we are disappointed, given that they took £42m so it is not as if they would struggle to put some money in.

'We campaigned for these guys to come
 in and once they came in they took as much as they could. They made us 
redundant, made false promises and left us hanging.

'It is very upsetting and cruel.

'There are people out there who needed that money and were relying on it. I just think it is very sad for the ex-workers.'

Mr Thomas added that, despite the request, he was not confident the workers would get any extra money from the 'Phoenix Four'.

1904: Rover, founded in Coventry as a bicycle business, produces its first car. 

1924: MG set up by Cecil Kimber in Oxford, producing sports cars and saloons. 

1959: Mini launched. 

1964: Sales of Mini Austin 1100 peak at 380,000. 

1968: British Leyland Motor Corporation takes over BMC and Rover. 

1975: Government effectively nationalises British Leyland. 

1980: Austin Metro launched. 

1988: British Aerospace takes over Rover.

1994: Rover sold to BMW 

Spring 2000: BMW breaks up Rover Group.

May 2000: John Towers pays a nominal £10 for MG Rover with his Phoenix consortium.

November 2003: Longbridge suspends production of 25, 45 and 75 models as sales slump.

March 2004: Commons committee accuses Phoenix of 'financial sleight of hand'.

August 2004: News emerges that MG Rover could be bought by the Chinese.

November 2004: BMW calls Rover bosses 'the unacceptable face of capitalism'.

April 2005: Government goes to China to try to secure a deal with the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation.

April 7, 2005: Production suspended at Longbridge.

Speaking to The Guardian, a spokesman for the four businessmen - who last May were disqualified from working as company directors in Britain for a total of 19 years - said: 'All we would want to say is that the request has been noted.'

Campaigners hopes for securing an additional £12.5m have recently been dashed in the High Court.

It ruled that Phoenix Venture Holdings - MG Rover's former parent - was not allowed more information on money paid to creditor HBOS by administrators in 2005.

Lloyds Banking Group  - the bank which now owns HBOS, said it made losses from the firm's collapse and has a duty to its shareholders to try and minimise the losses.

When Phoenix bought Rover in 2000 they had the backing of Rover workers and the Labour government.

It followed a warning from BMW that it could close the Longbridge plant, with the loss of thousands of jobs, unless a sale was secured within a month.

In one of the most dramatic rescue bids in the history of British industry, former Rover executive John Towers paid a nominal £10 for MG Rover when his Phoenix consortium took over the company from the German car giant.

But in October 2003, the car maker announced it had lost £111 million in the year to December, compared with £175 million in the previous 12 months.

Two years later, figures showed the firm had sold 12,545 cars in March, down by almost 17 per cent on March 2004.

In April, 2005,  MG Rover suspended production and it was later announced that the car giant was calling in the receivers.
