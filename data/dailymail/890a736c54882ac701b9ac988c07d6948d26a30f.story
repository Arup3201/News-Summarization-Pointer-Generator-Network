Whitney Houston's mother Cissy and two brothers stand to inherit the majority of her $20 million fortune if Bobbi Kristina passes away, according to reports.

The singer left her fortune to her daughter, who inherited 10 per cent - around $2 million - when she turned 21 last year, the New York Daily News reported. She would inherit another 15 per cent at age 25 before receiving the remainder at 30.

But if Bobbi Kristina, who is in a coma after being found face-down in a bathtub in her Georgia home on Saturday, passes away before she inherits the full amount, it will go to Cissy Houston and her sons, Michael and Gary, according to the will's terms.

Family: Whitney Houston left her fortune to her daughter Bobbi Kristina, right with her partner Nick Gordon, but if she passes away, the money will go to her grandmother - Houston's mother - Cissy Houston, together left

Cissy, pictured center in August 2012, and her sons Michael and Gary, left, will inherit the money if Bobbi Kristina passes away before reaching 30, when she will receive the final sum of money

Bobbi Kristina's father, R&B star Bobby Brown, was initially included as a beneficiary in Houston's will but after he divorced the singer in 2007, he was no longer entitled to inherit any money.

The family might also might face a battle with Bobbi Kristina's partner, Nick Gordon, for the money if he argues that he was married to her.

Gordon, who was brought up alongside Bobbi after Whitney Houston took him in as a child, started a romantic relationship with Bobbi Kristina after Houston's death in 2012.

Last year, the couple claimed they were married and shared a photo of their wedding bands online.

'#HappilyMarried So #Inlove,' Bobbi Kristina wrote alongside the image.

But this week, with his daughter fighting for her life, Bobby Brown released a statement saying the duo had never been married.

'We are currently investigating the events that led to the hospitalization of Bobbi Kristina,' his lawyer, Christopher Brown, said on Tuesday. 'To correct earlier reports, Bobbi Kristina is not and has never been married to Nick Gordon.'

If Gordon, who was never legally adopted by Houston, can prove he was married to her daughter, he can inherit her estate, the Daily News reported.

Of course, if Bobbi Kristina drew up her own will 'that trumps all', Atlanta legal expert Bruce Gaynes told the newspaper. 

When Bobbi Kristina inherited a portion of the fortune on her 21st birthday, her grandmother had expressed concern that she would dwindle it away.

She also expressed concern over reports of her granddaughter's relationship with Gordon.

Battle ahead? Nick Gordon, pictured outside a hospital where Bobbi Kristina was taken on Saturday, could fight her family for her money because he has claimed they are married - which relatives say is not true

On Thursday, RadarOnline reported that the 81-year-old is 'devastated' by what has happened to her granddaughter.

She flew from New Jersey to join the family at Bobbi Kristina's bedside at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta.

'Cissy is devastated to see Krissy in this condition,' a family source said. 'She is absolutely heartbroken to see her little grandbaby like this.'
