Dutch police have uncovered a city centre cannabis farm after spotting a remarkable lack of snow on the roof of one home, while neighbouring buildings suffered a heavy covering.

Officers in the city of Haarlem, 12 miles west of Amsterdam, raided the otherwise unremarkable home after spotting it had a snow-free roof despite heavy snowfall only hours earlier.

The lack of snow suggested the temperature inside the building was so high that the snow was melting more rapidly than on neighbours' homes - a tip-off from Mother Nature that Dutch police are turning to with increasing frequency in order to catch cannabis cultivators in the winter months.

Cultivation of marijuana requires the temperature inside a building to be far higher than in normal properties, with growers using expensive lighting rigs to ensure the plants are tricked into believing they are growing in a country with a warmer climate.

While in summer months the effects are not unnoticeable to anybody standing outside the building, the effects of keeping the plant at a steady 29C can lead to unwanted consequences. 

With snow almost guaranteed in the Netherlands' mid-winter, police are increasingly looking out for houses with a tell-tale frost free roof to locate the otherwise unremarkable residential houses drug lords favour when creating cannabis farms.

In fact the technique has become so common that Dutch police last week released details of several cannabis farms they discovered using the technique - including a photograph of the building in Haarlem.

Last Monday officers used the same premise to raid a farm in the city of Zutphen, where they found a total of 88 cannabis plants. Two days later one person was arrested in Arnhem in similar circumstances.

Not everybody is happy with the technique, however. After Haarlem police revealed the unorthodox method, Twitter users asked whether innocent families with a sauna in a loft conversion could also expect to be raided as potential drug lords, as their homes suffer similar snow-free roofs.

The arrests may come as something as a surprise to those who thought growth of cannabis was legal in the Netherlands, which has long had a relatively relaxed attitude towards the drug. 

However the law states that no more than five cannabis plants can be grown in any one, as that is believed to be the cultivation limit for personal use. Any more than five plants and the grower is considered to be a preparing the drugs for sale, which is illegal.

Possession of cannabis is restricted to no more than five grams in a public place. 

The Dutch police technique of visually checking rooftops for snow is something of a low-maintenance adaption of the way British police use helicopters equipped with heat-seeking technology to identify buildings giving off abnormally high levels of heat. 

Speaking in 2013, Martin Knowles, West Midlands Police Deputy Air Operations Manager, said: 'Our thermal cameras can detect unusually high temperatures coming from properties several thousand feet away – anyone growing cannabis on a commercial scale, using rows of heat lamps, runs the very real risk their criminality will be rumbled from the skies.'
