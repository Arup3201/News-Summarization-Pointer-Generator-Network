A neighbour of one Lee Rigby's suspected killers today claimed the pair were considering attacking him two months ago because he was wearing military-style clothing.

Father-of-two Paul Ramsamy, 46, said he recognised suspected murderer Michael Adebowale, 22, who is his neighbour, and co-accused Michael Adebolajo, 28.

He claims the two men they followed him menacingly two months ago and fears he could have been targeted.

'It could have been me': Paul Ramsamy believes he was followed by the murder suspects two months ago, because he was dressed in military style clothing

Mr Ramsamy lives in Greenwich, less than a mile from where Adebowale and Adebolajo allegedly hacked Lee Rigby, 25, to death in broad daylight.

He claims that the two men looked at his camouflage pants and military style shoes, exchanged a few words between themselves and then left him alone.

Mr Ramsamy said: 'They watched me and came at me together, walking towards me, both of them were in black. I still remember one of them, he watched my shoes. They looked very serious like they meant business.

Target? Paul Ramsamy, 46, who lived near Michael Adebowale, 22, in this block of flats in Greenwhich claims he could have been targeted because of his military clothing

Suspect: Michael Adebowale, 22, of Greenwich, South East London, with a knife in his hand at the scene where Lee Rigby was stabbed to death

Victim: Drummer Lee Rigby who was murdered in Woolwich

'They followed me for about 50 metres 
and approached me together, both of them were wearing black coats. I 
always walk very quick, they followed me. I got to the door and tried to
be kind and hold the door.

'They watched only my shoes, they stared at them, then said something to together and turned to go and just walked away.

'Maybe they watched my shoes because they're the same style as the military, and my trousers were the military ones, camouflage.

'I understand now when I watch the news that I was lucky, they didn't choose me, they didn't stab me, I'm very lucky. It is fresh in my head.

'It was both of them, it was only this one time I saw them, the other time was on the news.'

Adebolajo was filmed with blood on his hands wielding a knife just yards from where Rigby, 25, lay murdered on Wednesday afternoon.

The two men were shot by police and rushed to hospital where they were expected to make a full recovery.
