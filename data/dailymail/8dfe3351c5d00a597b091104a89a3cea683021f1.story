Peers are rebelling against government plans to restrict press freedom just days after David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband put together a deal.

Labour's Lord Wilf Stevenson has tabled an amendment to exempt small not-for-profit firms while Tory Lord Lucas wants to exclude any publication or website employing under 250 journalists.

His proposals, to be debated by peers on 
Monday, would also stop local newspapers being classed as 'relevant 
publishers' under the new code.

Deal: Plans to restrict press freedom were agreed by Ed Miliband, David Cameron and Nick Clegg

Even Labour MP Tom Watson, who led calls for regulation, has asked for 'urgent clarification' over who it will affect. Under the proposals which follow the Leveson inquiry, all blogs would be regulated.

Critic: Former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown accused David Cameron of a 'strategic blunder'

The moves came as the Prime Minister was accused of making a colossal 'strategic blunder' in pulling out of talks on the creation of a new press regulator.

Former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said Mr Cameron had simultaneously 
damaged his standing with his own MPs, angered his supporters in the 
newspapers, and strained relations with his Lib Dem coalition partners.

In an interview with BBC Radio 4's The Week In Westminster, to be broadcast today, he said Mr Cameron managed to achieve the 'Tory nightmare' of forcing Nick Clegg to line up with Labour.

He added: 'I have not seen an avoidable strategic blunder made by a British prime minister or indeed the leader of a British political party which matches that of Mr Cameron over Leveson.

'He marched his troops up to the top of the hill and then he had to march them back down again.

'In terms of strategy, this seems to me to make the Grand Old Duke of York look like a military genius.'

Breaking ranks: Michael Gove with the Prime Minister. He said he was 'uncomfortable' with politicians deciding how the press should be regulated

Debate: Lord Leveson holds the report which has caused so much controversy since its publication

Mr Cameron dramatically broke off talks 
with Ed Miliband and Mr Clegg on the implementation of the Leveson 
report on press standards after the Labour and Lib Dem leaders insisted 
the planned new regulator was backed by legislation.

Demand: Labour MP Tom Watson

Within days he was forced to accede to
their central demand after it became clear that he would face defeat in
the Commons if he did not.

Lord
Ashdown said Mr Cameron's 'snatch' decision would have serious 
consequences for his relations with the press - who are largely opposed 
to the new regulator and may boycott it - with his own party, and with 
the Lib Dems.

'The consequence was that he diminished his stature within his own party who must look on this somewhat askance, 'he said. 'It was very badly judged.

'The second consequence is that he forced Nick Clegg to do the one thing that the Tories don't want him to do. He forced him to go and speak to Labour, just the very thing that is the Tory nightmare.

'He also seriously damaged his relationship with the right-wing press that supports him - who now regards him with a sulphurous regard.'

Lord Ashdown added: 'I have no doubt that Mr Cameron's actions - very ill-advised, hastily grabbed at, not thought through - could have done the coalition more damage than I think any other act since the coalition was formed, had it not been for the cool head of Nick Clegg.'

On Thursday, Education Secretary Michael Gove broke ranks with his Cabinet colleagues to warn he was was 'uncomfortable' about politicians deciding how the press should be regulated.

He also queried why journalists are 
being held over hacking when police have not acted against bankers or 
those involved in the Mid Staffs hospital deaths.
