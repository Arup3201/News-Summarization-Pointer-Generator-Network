Since taking home silver at the London 2012 Olympics, Zara Phillips has become a national treasure and she is clearly loving every second.

She may be the Queen's granddaughter and 14th in line to the throne - 
but she is accomplished and independent in her own right as she proved by her solo trip to Australia this week.

The talented horsewoman is spending a 
week on the Gold Coast as the ambassador for the Magic Millions 
carnival's Racing Women initiative.

The two-week Magic Millions event is headlined by a $500,000 female incentive race in which $2million
prize money will go to the first four 'all-female owned or leased' 
horses to cross the line.

The brainchild of Magic Millions 
owner Katie Page-Harvey, the initiative is aimed at boosting the numbers
of female jockeys, trainers and owners in Australia- a cause perfect 
for keen jockey Zara- who was snapped up as Magic Millions Racing Women 
ambassador just days after she won silver in the London Olympics.

Good cause: Keen horsewoman Zara believes it is a great cause

Donning a crisp white shirt with jeans 
and ever-so-apt cowboy hat by day and a stunning cocktail dress by 
night, the young Royal proved a hit with the locals.

Speaking to AAP, Zara spoke about possible presents for Prince William and Kate's unborn baby - and shot down suggestions she would be buying the Royal baby a horse.

She said: 'No,
no presents, though I was thinking about getting some of the girls 
together in a syndicate. Maybe next year.'

A keen rider, Zara spoke with great enthusiasm about lending her support to the cause.

She said: 'Men have always traditionally been portrayed 
as the owners and whatever, while women are supposed to just come 
along,

Enjoyment: Zara seems to be loving every second of her time in Australia

'We want to change that and ensure more are taking part as the decision-makers.'

When Zara returns home she has the joy of helping husband Mike Tindall train a horse he bought with his rugby friends following its win at the Welsh National last weekend.

'He's only just told me about that. I'm not sure what he wants me to do,' she said.

'I'll look at it when I get home.'
