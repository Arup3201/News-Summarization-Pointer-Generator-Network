For years, New York has had a reputation for questionable coffee standards. But a new movement is creating a cafe revolution in the Big Apple - and it’s all thanks to Aussie expats who are bringing a little bit of home to the concrete jungle.

The New York Times say Australian cafes have stamped their identity on the New York food scene.

'What started as an expedition a few years ago has become an invasion: like the French bistro, the British pub and the Californian juice bar.'

One of these pioneers is 32-year-old Melbournian Nicholas Stone, who in August 2013 opened the first of his ‘quintessentially Australian’ cafés in New York.

One year on, and Mr Stone will soon have five cafes located all over New York, with Americans embracing the Australian coffee experience.

‘Coffee in Australia is about finding your local and becoming so loyal to the café that you feel like you’re cheating if you go anywhere else!

'That didn't really happen in New York but I think these Australian cafes are creating that ‘loyalty’, because customers get to enjoy a unique, personal experience.’

Mr Stone says his line of ‘Bluestone Lane’ cafes have quickly gathered notoriety. 

‘Our café in West Village opened in June this year and it’s created a lot of buzz. Taylor Swift has come to visit three times, Susan Sarandon’s come… In a year, it has already been so successful, the New York market love it.’

Nick Stone says the aesthetic of the cafes is essential, to create an escape from the New York 'concrete jungle'

Mr Stone came to New York four years ago to study business at university.

He immediately missed the Australian coffee back home.

This was catalyst for his new business venture; his ‘Bluestone Lane’ cafes, named after the paving stones on a street in Melbourne.

‘I wanted to create something like the coffee culture in Melbourne, where you feel connected to the coffee shop.’

‘I didn’t just miss the quality of coffee, I also missed the ambiance of those cafes. You feel an intrinsic connection when they know your name, know your order, have a routine…  I knew I needed to hire a team that didn't just create a quality product, but also really care about interacting with people.

'Australians produce the café and coffee experience at such a pristine level so we’re trying to replicate that here.'

When recruiting his café team, Mr Stone literally wanted to bring Australia to New York.

‘We sourced our team from Australia. Our baristas, servers… We recruited people from Australia who were passionate, energised and professional to come and work for us.'

Mr Stone says that the aesthetic of the cafe is crucial.

'You have to think carefully about the space to create an escape from the concrete jungle. One of our cafes is on Wall Street, literally right next to the stock exchange. You want to create a getaway!'

Mr Stone says Australians don't just drink coffee for the caffeine, unlike Americans. Australians are teaching Americans how to drink coffee for the experience.

'In New York, they have a very high level of coffee consumption. But coffee was just about getting as much caffeine into you as you could, like a liquid drug. We Australians care about the artisan beverage.'
