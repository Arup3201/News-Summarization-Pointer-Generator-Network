Shola Ameobi looks set to be reunited with Alan Pardew at Crystal Palace.

The former Newcastle striker - who left Turkish club Gaziantep in December - had been on the verge of a move to West Brom but Sportsmail understands he favours a move to Selhurst Park, where ex-Magpies boss Pardew took charge earlier this month.

Ameobi scored 79 goals in 397 appearances for Newcastle before leaving St James’ Park last year after 14 years.
