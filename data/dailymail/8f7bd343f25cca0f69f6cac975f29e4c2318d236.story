Abandoned: Lee Doran, 17, was left alone in Portugal after fighting with his stepfather on a plane

A teenager was abandoned in Portugal after a fight with his stepfather forced a plane to make an emergency landing.

Lee Doran, 17, was on his first trip abroad with half-brother Dylan, 14, stepfather David Laughton, 39, his partner Sarah Wilson, 28, and their son Harry, three, when he and David had a fierce row at 35,000ft.

The stepfather claims the incident has been 'blown up out of proportion'.

During the flight to the Spanish island Lanzarote, Mr Laughton and his stepson got into such a heated row that the pilot was forced to land in Portugal and ordered them off the plane.

Holidaymakers were forced to wait as the
 quarrelling family were marched off the plane by waiting police 
officers at Porto airport.

Members of the family were questioned but eventually released without charge.

They then left seventeen-year-old stepson Lee alone in Porto as they caught another flight to their holiday destination.

Mr Laughton was contacted at his hotel 
in Lanzarote where he revealed he eventually made his way to the 
destination via Madrid with his family following the row, at a cost of 
£1,500.

He downplayed the incident which is believed to have cost the plane's carrier, Thomson, an estimated £35,000.

He told the Daily Mirror: 'We were 50 minutes from landing and Lee pulled his hood up and I pulled it down.

'The next thing I knew, he had his arms around my neck and we ended up in the aisle.

'When we got to Porto he wouldn't take any money from me. Lee is 17 and lives on his own in London. This has been blown out of all proportion.'

But he apologised to his fellow airline passengers for the disruption his row with his stepson caused.

He added: 'I understand this caused a great deal of upset, but we would not continue on the trip as was planned.

'I am sorry that the plane was diverted and I can understand why that action was taken.'

The family were heading to Lanzarote 
for a two week all-inclusive break costing £1,500 when the argument 
broke out on the flight from Newcastle on September 13.

Diverting the plane was a last resort, a spokesman for the airline said.

The family were on their way to Lanzarote, pictured, for a two week holiday. They eventually arrived there but left stepson Lee Doram, 17, alone in Porto

He said: ‘We would like to apologise to passengers for any disruption encountered during the flight.

‘Unfortunately a party of passengers became disruptive on board and as a last resort the flight had to be diverted to Portugal.

‘Upon landing, the aircraft was met by local police and the passengers were removed from the flight for further questioning.

‘Thomson operates a zero tolerance policy with regards to any disruptive behaviour on board and incidents of this type are extremely rare.’

The couple, from Hartlepool, Cleveland, have been banned from the return flight and will have to make their own arrangements to get home.

Jannine Bird, Lee’s mother, who is 
also mother to 14-year-old Dylan, was horrified to discover that Lee had
 been left alone at the airport.

Ms
 Bird, who split with Mr Laughton a decade ago after an eight-year 
relationship, said: ‘To leave Lee all by himself in a foreign country is
 just appalling.’

She made 
desperate arrangements with the Foreign Office and the British Embassy 
in Portugal to bring Lee home safely after he spent 24 hours waiting 
outside the police station and the airport.

British embassy staff arranged for him to be flown home in London, where he lives with Ms Bird with the 14-year-old child in Islington. The flight cost Ms Bird £200.

Ms Bird, who works for an asbestos removal firm and lives in Islington, London with her two sons, said that Mr Laughton was seeing the boys during the summer.

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: ‘We are aware of the incident and we have provided consulate assistance but we don’t comment on cases involving minors.’
