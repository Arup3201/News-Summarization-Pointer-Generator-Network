Warren Buffett could lose $1billion due to plummeting IBM stocks, it has been reported.

Company Berkshire Hathaway, of which Buffett is CEO, has 70,173,978 IBM shares, MarketWatch reported. 

Buffett risked losing $1,056,118,369 when IBM saw its stock price fall 8.3% before the market opened, the website reported early Monday morning.

While still costly, Buffett's Monday loss may actually be slightly less.

As of this writing, IBM's stocks are down 7.14%, which would mean a $912,261,714 loss.

Bad investment: Warren Buffett may lose hundreds of millions of dollars Monday due to IBM's plummeting stocks 

In early October, Buffett said of a loss on Tesco worth hundreds of millions of dollars to CNBC: 'With Tesco, we definitely made a mistake. I made a mistake on that one more than anybody else made a mistake ... That was a huge mistake by me.'  

IBM fell short of Wall Street profit expectations and revenue slid 4 per cent, sending shares down 7 per cent at the open of trading.

IBM's performance dragged down shares across the semiconductor industry.

The company will pay $1.5 billion to Globalfoundries in order to shed its costly chip division.

IBM Director of Research John E. Kelly III said in an interview Monday that handing over control of the semiconductor operations will allow it to grow faster, while IBM continues to invest in and expand its chip research.

IBM will make payments to the chipmaker over three years, but it took a $4.7 billion charge for the third quarter when it reported earnings Monday.

Privately held Globalfoundries will get IBM's global commercial semiconductor technology business, including intellectual property and technologies related to IBM Microelectronics. It also gets IBM's semiconductor manufacturing operations and plants in East Fishkill, New York and Essex Junction, Vermont, as well as access to thousands of patents and IBM's commercial microelectronics business.

Globalfoundries said that it plans to employ substantially all IBM workers at the East Fishkill and Essex Junction plants, except for a team of semiconductor server group employees who will stay with IBM.

Under the agreement, Globalfoundries will become IBM's exclusive server processor semiconductor technology provider for 22 nanometer (nm), 14nm and 10nm semiconductors for the next 10 years. Globalfoundries was spun off from Advanced Micro Devices in 2009 to handle chip production.

IBM said handing over the chip division will allow it to concentrate on fundamental semiconductor research and the development of future cloud, mobile, big data analytics, and secure transaction-optimized systems.

The transaction is expected to close next year.

On Monday, IBM reported that its adjusted earnings from continuing operations were $3.68 per share, while revenue totaled $22.4 billion. The performance missed the expectations of analysts polled by FactSet, who predicted earnings of $4.32 per share on revenue of $23.39 billion.

In a statement, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty said 'We are disappointed in our performance. We saw a marked slowdown in September in client buying behavior, and our results also point to the unprecedented pace of change in our industry. While we did not produce the results we expected to achieve, we again performed well in our strategic growth areas – cloud, data and analytics, security, social and mobile - where we continue to shift our business. We will accelerate this transformation.' 

Shares of International Business Machines Corp., based in Armonk, fell $13.05 to $169 in premarket trading.
