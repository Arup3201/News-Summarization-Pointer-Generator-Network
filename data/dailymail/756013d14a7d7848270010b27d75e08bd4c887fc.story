Jennifer and Chris Nugent had spent thousands of dollars to turn a spacious house in Mooresville Indiana, into their dream home where they were hoping to raise their children and retire one day.

But what the Nugents did not know was that their new house was a former meth den that was now slowly poisoning their entire family, including their pet dog.

Chris and Jenny Nugent used all their savings last year to take out a mortgage on a $144,000 two-story house with a porch and an acre of land.

What lurks inside: The Nugent family bought this home in Moorseville, Indiana, last year, only to discover that it has been contaminated with meth 

Worst fears confirmed: Jenny and Chris Nugent (left) were told by a neighbor that the previous owner of the house, Josh Argue (right), allegedly used to cook and smoke meth inside their new home 

Before closing on the house, they paid for a home inspection which came back clean: no termites or mold were found. So in May 2013 the Nugents proceeded with an extensive makeover.

But as soon as they moved in, everyone in the house started getting sick, including the couple's two young daughters and infant son.

'They were sick every week,' Jenny Nugent told ABC News. 'They would wake up. Throw up. Have digestive issues and then by noon, one o’clock start to feel better.'

The mystery malady seemed to be affecting the entire household, and even the family dog eventually had to be euthanized after falling ill with cancer.

For the Nugents, one early tell-tale sign was a strange metallic smell that permeated the house and was especially strong in the kitchen.

Sickened: The Nugents' three children (pictured), and even the family dog, suffered from vomiting, nausea, difficulty breathing and headaches. The pet eventually fell ill with cancer and had to be put down

From dream home to house of horrors: A test showed that the first floor, including the baby room, had meth levels 18 times higher than what is considered safe

Driven out: After learning the awful truth, the family moved out of the remodeled house and into an apartment

Then in February a neighbor finally shed light on what was happening inside their home: the previous owner had allegedly cooked and used methamphetamine inside.

Mrs Nugent immediately purchased a meth test kit for $50, and the results confirmed their worst fears.

The first floor of their house, including the baby room, had meth levels 18 times higher than what is considered safe under the law, and the upstairs bedrooms were three times the legal limit..

The Nugents moved out of their dream home at once and settled in an apartment after discarding most of their belonging for fear of contamination,

‘It feels like a death happened, to be honest,’ Jenny Nugent said. ‘That’s how it feels to my husband and I.’

The process of manufacturing meth involves highly toxic chemicals, which give off noxious fumes that contaminate everything in sight, including carpets and paint on the walls.

Prolonged exposure to methamphetamine particles can cause vomiting, difficulty breathing and headaches.

Chris Nugent, a retired US Marine, said that he, his wife and their three children were constantly out of breath and thought they were having asthma attacks on a nearly daily basis.

‘I feel like I put them in harm's way more so than I ever could have just staying where we were. I regret moving so bad,' the mother of three told WRTV.

Legal action: The Nugents have filed a lawsuit against their real estate agent, Lori Argue (pictured center), claiming that she had to know the truth about the house since it was her own son, Josh (pictured far left), who used to own it  

In order to resell the one-time drug den, the Nugents have been forced to hire a professional cleaning company to decontaminate the entire house to the tune of $10,000, which they had to pay out of pocket because their insurance company refused to cover the clean-up cost citing 'pollution exclusions' in their policy.

The family have now filed a lawsuit against the real estate agent who sold them the property, along with the real estate company, Carpenter Realtors, and the former owner, claiming breach of contract.

According to the Nugents, realtor Lori Argue had to know the seedy history of the house since the person who had lived there before them was her son, Joshua Argue.

A lawyer for the realtor has vehemently denied any knowledge of meth use or contamination of the property in a statement to ABC News. 

The Nugents are not alone. Since 2007, more than 3,400 dwellings have been identified as meth labs in Indiana - the highest number in the nation.
