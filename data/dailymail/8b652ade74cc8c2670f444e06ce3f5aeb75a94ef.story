Maybe this artist is hoping to build on his reputation for creating shocking installations.

But Italian experimental sculptor Fra Biancoshock certainly had the residents of Prague stopping in their tracks when they came across his latest piece of work.

The artwork, entitled 'urban intervention', was made to seem as if a building in the Czech capital had fallen from the sky to crush an unsuspecting rough sleeper.

Biancoshock is developing a growing following of fans with his 'pop up' installations which appear randomly in streets around Europe.

Explaining the idea behind his latest concept, He said: 'Biancoshock is a different concept from being an artist and further still, from being a street artist.

'My "experiences" are not showcases to promote my activities, they do not require any description.

'They are simply opportunities to communicate and provoke reactions from common people.

'I'm
 talking about all those who, although with little or no artistic 
education, still want to be surprised and moved by something that was 
left on the street for all to see.'

Biancoshock is part of a new breed of unconventional and provocative street artists.

According to the biography on his own website, 'He does not read about art, he does not work in theÂ  art field, he does not paint, he is not part of a scene and, above all, as soon as he can, he takes his distances from all the cliches that build the fancy world of art.

'Fra Biancoshock is convinced that acting in the streets is the best way to get to as many persons as he can, and that irony and provocation are the sharpest weapons one can use.'

Provocative: The 'urban intervention' is an attempt to 'communicate and provoke reactions from common people', according to the artist
