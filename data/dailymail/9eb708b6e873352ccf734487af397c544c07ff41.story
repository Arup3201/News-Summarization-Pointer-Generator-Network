Young women are turning to 'fat-zapping' laser treatment on their upper legs in a bid to achieve the uber thin 'thigh gap' look.

Tara from Dallas, Texas, who declined to give her first name or age to CBS News, said the body trend - sparked by naturally-slender celebrities including Cara Delevingne and Alexa Chung - is what 'every girl' lusts after, despite it being physically impossible for most.

Indeed, even after hitting the gym five days a week and eating healthy, the blonde found her legs still touched above the knees so she paid Thrive Institute $999 to 'magic her thin'.

Body trend: Young women are turning to 'fat-zapping' laser treatment on their legs in a bid to achieve the impossibly thin 'thigh gap' look

The clinic recently invested in a Zerona Cold Laser device, more frequently used by women to tone the stomach and arm area.

The slimming gadget - approved by the FDA for aesthetic treatment in 2010 - uses Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) that ‘pokes’ temporary holes in the walls of fat cells, causing them to collapse.

The expelled liquid fat is then used as energy or processed via the liver. 

Zerona is about half the price of liposuction and manufacturers say it does not cause any pain or swelling.

Now it appears young women are hoping it will help shave inches off their legs as they look to emulate their favorite super-skinny celebrities.

Tara was told she would see the results in about two weeks after going in for six 40-minute sessions.

As she was filmed having her thighs 'lasered' in a bikini, she exclaimed, ' I can't feel a single thing.'

Clint Herzog, the owner of Thrive Institute appears optimistic that Zerona will be in high-demand over the coming months as beach season hits.

'Everybody
 has one part of their body that it's really hard to get fat off right? 
And that's where Zerona comes in,' he said.

Dr.

 Vonda Wright, a Pittsburgh-based orthopedic surgeon and fitness expert,
 previously told the Associated Press that the spacing between a 
person's legs is based mostly on genetics.

And even extraordinarily thin people may not have a body type that can 
achieve a gap. You have to be both skinny and wide-hipped, she said.

Experts
 say it is impossible to know if the pursuit of a thigh gap has caused 
any deaths, nor is it known how many eating disorders are blamed on the 
phenomenon exacerbated by social media.

But
 Claire Mysko, who oversees teen outreach and digital media for the 
National Eating Disorders Association, says studies have shown 'exposure
 to online 
images of extreme beauty standards and the drive to compare does 
increase the risk of developing eating disorders.'
