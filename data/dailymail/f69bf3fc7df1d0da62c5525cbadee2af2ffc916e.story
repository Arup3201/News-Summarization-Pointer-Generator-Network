These stunning surfing action shots capture all the energy of the adrenalin-fuelled sport from inside the crests of crashing waves.

The images are the brainchild of Australian photographer Lee Kelly, who enlisted his bodyboarder pal to help snap the pictures as they took on the swell off Teahupo'o in Tahiti, a famous mecca for thrill-seeking surfers.

The 34-year-old attached a special lens to his camera along with a custom-made water housing to protect it from the surf, before handing the equipment to a professional bodyboarder to shoot pictures - even as the waves were poised to crash over his head.

Mr Kelly, who grew up near legendary surfing hotspot Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia, said: 'I work hard taking photos like this, but when they come off, it really is a bit of a fluke.

'I had to set up my Canon digital SLR camera with a super wide fish-eye lens inside a custom made water housing.

'I adjust all the settings based on the lighting and hand the whole thing to bodyboarder Glen Thurston who has the fun job of catching one of these crazy waves - holding the camera in one hand.'

The photographer said capturing the action shots was no mean feat.

'He (Glen Thurston) gets all the credit. It's not easy for him,' said Mr Kelly, who said shots can easily be ruined by water drops getting on the camera lens, or the camera being ripped out of the bodyboarder's hand by the impact of the surf.

'He could frame it badly by accident as he has no idea where the camera is pointing,' the photographer explained.

'He could wipe out and have the camera ripped out of his hand, or smash onto the coral reef and flood my camera. So much can go wrong, so when you nail a good one it's quite exciting.

'We were very lucky this particular day that everything went to plan. The waves were perfect for this kind of work and we had it to ourselves.

'Every wave my friend caught with the camera was both exciting and nerve-wracking, knowing we would either have something special, or a broken camera.'

Mr Kelly said he grew up bodyboarding at Bondi Beach.

'Some of my friends became professionals, opening an opportunity for me to combine my love of surf travel with my friends and photography, it was perfect.

'As you get more experience, inspiration and ideas you start to try new things, and when the conditions align you can put these ideas into effect,' he said.

'It takes time and customised equipment - which is not cheap - but when you nail that magic moment and people appreciate it, it's all worth it.'
