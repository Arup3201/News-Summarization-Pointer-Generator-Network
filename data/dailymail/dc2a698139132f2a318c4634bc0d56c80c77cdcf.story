Probe: A former inspector accused of 'acting on behalf' of Jimmy Savile by contacting Surrey Police officers before they interviewed the paedophile presenter is being formally investigated

A former police inspector ‘acted on behalf’ of Jimmy Savile before his controversial interview over sex assaults of teenage girls, it was claimed last night.

The West Yorkshire-based officer is alleged to have contacted Surrey Police before its detectives interviewed Savile in 2009.

Transcripts of the interviews – released by the force this week – provoked anger as they appeared to show detectives adopting a kid-glove approach to the DJ and paedophile who was being accused of sexually assaulted girls at a school in Staines during the 1970s.

And today a former Leeds police officer revealed that Savile was notorious within the force - but no one ever dared challenge him.

Ex-officer Paul Leonard, 68, told the Daily Mirror he once discovered the television star in his Rolls Royce with a young girl.

When he approached the car, Savile said: 'I'm waiting for midnight when she turns 16... so p*** off if you want to keep your job.'

The former officer - who had his name changed - said he was told by his Sergeant that the star had 'friends in high places' when he tried to bring it up.

Mr Leonard's allegations emerged as it was revealed that during interviews with Surrey Police, Savile boasted of his ‘collection’ of police contacts in Leeds.

The disgraced broadcaster told detectives that he had been targeted with false claims by blackmailers, and said: ‘I have up in Yorkshire, where I live in Leeds, a collection of senior police persons who come to see me socially, but I give them all my weirdo letters.’

The informal meetings between Savile and police at his flat in Leeds were known as the ‘Friday Morning Club’.

But it has emerged that the interview took place months after the West Yorkshire inspector first contacted Surrey Police over their plans to quiz Savile about the ‘historic’ sex allegations.

The officer told Surrey Police that he knew the DJ ‘personally’ and allegedly brokered the interview with Savile.

A previously released Surrey Police report on its dealings with Savile referred to the officer as ‘Inspector 5’, and said he had phoned the force as it tried to set up an interview with him over the sex claims.

Last night the Independent Police Complaints Commission revealed that a preliminary probe had been launched into the claims but this would now become a full investigation.

In the interview, lasting just 56 minutes, Savile denied claims he forced one girl to touch his groin, made another perform a sex act and stuck his tongue down a young girl’s throat.

He claimed that the women were looking to make money out of the allegations, which were put to him during an interview in his office at Stoke Mandeville Hospital on October 1, 2009.

It was not clear last night whether the officer, who has since left West Yorkshire Police, was among those officers who attended Savile’s ‘Friday Morning Club’.

Victims of Savile and child protection campaigners called for an independent inquiry into the police dealings with the Top of the Pops star.

The Radio 1 DJ is thought to have raped 34 women and girls and sexually assaulted up to 450 people, including some as young as eight, according to an official report. He died two years ago, aged 84.

Last night, Jill Bartlett, who was raped by Savile, falling pregnant at the age of 16, said there should be an inquiry.

She said: ‘Jimmy Savile was very persuasive, but police should have training so they’re not fooled. All kinds of criminals and psychopaths are persuasive and the police should be above that.

‘I think there should be a full inquiry into their dealings with him. He was known as someone who liked young women, and the police should have known about it and acted.’

Caroline Moore, who was 13 and recovering from an operation on a children’s ward at the hospital when Savile stuck his tongue down her throat, called for an inquiry into the police.

The 54-year-old, who is disabled and from Clarkston, East Renfrewshire, said: ‘There should be a proper investigation into all the social meetings Savile said he had with police. Not an internal police investigation, because no one really has faith in them any more.’

Sylvia Edwards was 19 when she was groped by Savile after he put his hand up her skirt during a live broadcast of Top of the Pops in 1976. Cameras caught her shrieking and moving away from him.

Yesterday, she said: ‘I honestly think the police should be held accountable. There should be an inquiry and people should be made to stand up. The (police officers) should be named.’

Asked whether Surrey Police missed an opportunity to prosecute Savile while he was still alive, she said: ‘I don’t think they missed it, I think they deliberately ignored it because of who he was.’

Child protection expert Mark Williams-Thomas, a former Surrey Police detective, said: ‘It’s clear that over a period of time complaints were made about Savile and information was held about him and I think it’s fair to say West Yorkshire Police’s report was a whitewash. It was very poor.’

Operation Newgreen, a West Yorkshire Police report published this year, found no evidence that Savile was shielded from arrest and protected from prosecution by his relationship with the force.

A spokesman for the IPCC said: ‘The Commission has begun an independent investigation in relation to the alleged actions of a former inspector with West Yorkshire Police.

'The allegations refer to the officer having “acted on behalf” of Jimmy Savile by inappropriately contacting Surrey Police ahead of a police interview.’
