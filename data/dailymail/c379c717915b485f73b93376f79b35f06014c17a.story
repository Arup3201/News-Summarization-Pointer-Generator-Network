Twenty-two artworks belonging to the brother-in-law of Cornelius Gurlitt, whose Munich flat was filled with a £1 billion Nazi art haul, are being checked by police and art experts.

The works, four of which are believed to have come from Gurlitt's collection, may also have been looted by the Nazi.

They were removed from a flat in Kornwestheim, near Stuttgart, after the man informed police that they were in his possession.

He had apparently wanted advice on storing them safely.

The man is not suspected of any crimes, according to regional broadcaster SWR.

Meanwhile, German authorities have begun publishing an online list of works that were discovered in  Gurlitt's flat.

The government has been heavily criticised for keeping silent for 21 months about the trove. Pictured is Couple (1924) by Hans Christoph

A statement from the national and Bavarian regional governments said 25 of the works would initially be displayed on an existing website created to help establish the provenance of works seized by the Nazis, mostly from Jews during the persecution of the Holocaust.

The government has been heavily criticised for keeping silent for 21 months about the trove of 1,406 European art works, notably by families whose relatives were robbed by the Nazis.

The hoard's legal status is likely to be contested. Customs officials stumbled on it during a routine inspection in Munich's smart Schwabing district in February 2012.

‘The origins of the so-called "Schwabing art trove" will be traced as quickly and transparently as possible,’ the federal and state governments said late on Monday - over a week after news of the find was reported by the Munich magazine Focus.

‘To establish transparency and to further expedite research into provenance, the first 25 works that are suspected to have been taken under Nazi persecution will be displayed on the www.lostart.de platform, and that will be continuously updated.’

The paintings, sketches and sculptures 
hoarded by the war-era art dealer Hildebrand Gurlitt, put in charge of 
selling confiscated ‘degenerate’ art by Adolf Hitler, were found in the 
apartment of his reclusive 79-year-old son, Cornelius.

Theodore Rousseau's Vue de la vallee de la Seine (undated) was also in Gurlitt's possession

The legal status of the artworks is ambiguous. Pictured is Christoph Voll's Sprengmeister Hantsch ('Demolition Expert Hantsch', 1922)

Erich Fraass' Mother and Child (1922). According to authorities, there are clear grounds to suspect that these works of art were confiscated by the Nazi regime

But their legal status is ambiguous, 
nearly 70 years after a war in which the Nazis plundered hundreds of 
thousands of art works from museums and from individuals, most of them 
Jews.

The government's 
coordination centre for lost art said on the website that around 970 of 
the works were believed to have been confiscated, stolen or looted by 
the Nazis.

Some legal 
experts say Gurlitt may get to keep the art, but others say Germany 
could nullify his ownership under the 1998 Washington Declaration, a set
 of principles for dealing with looted art. The governments said they 
had set up a team of six experts to examine the provenance of the works.

Missing: Gurlitt's whereabouts are not clear. Pictured is Otto Dix's Dompteuse ('Animal Trainer', 1922)

Bonaventura Genelli's Male Nude (undated) was among the first batch of paintings that German authorities posted online

The U.S pressured the Germany government into publishing the paintings. Pictured is Wilhelm Lachnit's Maedchen am Tisch (Girl at the Table, 1923)

Gurlitt's whereabouts are not clear. He is under investigation for tax evasion and concealment but has not been charged.

The
 federal government, which ordinarily leaves such cases to regional 
justice officials, stepped up its involvement after the United States 
asked it to publish a list of the art works.

The
 move by the German authorities to publish the artworks follows the 
revelation that U.S authorities had the chance to seize the artworks 
from Hildebrandt Gurlitt at the end of the war.

Even though investigators were suspicious, they let him go.

Gurlitt is is under investigation for tax evasion and concealment, but has not been charged. Pictured is Honore Daumier's Don Quichote and Sancho Panza (about 1865)

The works were first discovered in 2012. Pictured is Otto Griebel's Child at the Table

The remarkable find was first revealed in Germany's Focus magazine. Pictured is Carl Spitzweg's Das Klavierspiel ('Piano Serenade', about 1840)

Previously unknown: Marc Chagall's Allegorical Scene (undated)

Displayed: Auguste Rodin's 'Etude de femme nue debout, les bras releves, les mains croisees au-dessus de la tite' (undated)

Nine hundred and seventy of the works were believed to have been confiscated, stolen or looted by the Nazis. Pictured is Otto Griebel's Die Verschleierte ('The Veiled', 1926)

American investigators 
at the time expressed doubts about Gurlitt's claims to the works, but 
they eventually decided that in most cases he was the rightful owner.

So on December 15, 1950, the U.S. returned 206 items to him: 115 paintings, 19 drawings and 72 'various other objects'.
