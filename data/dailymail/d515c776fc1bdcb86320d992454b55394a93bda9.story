Phil Taylor survived a scare to reach the quarter-finals of the 2015 World Darts Championship on Tuesday night despite the antics of Kim Huybrechts at the Alexandra Palace.

The 16-time record world champion was visibly annoyed whenever Huybrechts celebrated, and punished the Belgian by coming from behind three times to win 4-3.

The Power warned the 29-year-old on Sunday he was looking forward to a ‘good scrap’ and that there would ‘be trouble’ if Huybrechts jumped around on stage as he normally does.

Taylor’s threats did little to deter Huybrechts from getting up to his usual tricks but the psychological ploy did not get the better of The Power.

‘I’m speechless. I’m through. I’m still in,’ Taylor said. ‘I’m going to get ready for the next round now. I’m over the moon, I really am. I’m going to get better. I’m going to improve. Trust me, I’m going to get better.’

Taylor’s 102.5 average to Huybrechts’s 96.9 paid off in the end, thought the underdog surprised by taking the first set in front of a sold-out 2,500 crowd at the Ally Pally.

The Power made it 1-1 then had to come from behind again after losing the third, where he was being wound up by his opponent’s flaunting celebration. After levelling it at 2-2, Taylor walked away from the oche mumbling to himself.

Huybrechts went ahead again, making it 3-2, putting him one set away from a major upset. He had a 141 finish to win the match, but was unable to do so.

Taylor responded, making it 3-3, and made a point to smile at his opponent after retrieving his darts from the board. The Power won the match 4-3 with double 18 his final stab, and the pair shook hands.

The Ally Pally was rocking as record 16-time world champion Phil Taylor was pushed close to defeat 

‘I’m going to be back. I’m going to work hard and be there again and try as hard as I can,’ Huybrechts said. ‘That’s new for me. Phil has been on that stage 30, 40 times. It’s my fourth time.

‘I’ve done myself proud, fans proud, sponsors, proud. I’m happy. I fought until the end. People can blame me celebrating in the end, but I’ve done myself proud.’

Taylor would not have been the only former world champion to be booted from the competition that offers £250,000 to the winner. Adrian Lewis, winner in 2011 and 2012, hit a nine-darter but ultimately lost 4-3 against Raymond van Barneveld earlier in the night.
