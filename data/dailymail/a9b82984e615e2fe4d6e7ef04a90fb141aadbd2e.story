It seems Ant and Dec weren't the only Newcastle representatives at the BRIT Awards on Wednesday night, as Steven Taylor, Tim Krul and Jack Colback were pictured leaving an after-party in the early hours of the morning.

The trio attended the ceremony at London's O2 Arena, before heading to the Warner Music after-party at Freemasons' Hall near Covent Garden where they partied with music's finest.

Also in attendance at the star-studded bash were Rita Ora, Orlando Bloom, Ed Sheeran and Newcastle fans Ant and Dec, who presented the ceremony earlier in the evening.

Taylor looked like he'd had a long night as he left the event in the early hours of Thursday morning, while Krul was pictured alongside his English girlfriend Claire Hall.

The players will now travel back to the Toon, where preparations begin for the visit of Aston Villa on Saturday afternoon.

It has been a disappointing month for the Magpies, picking up just two points after two draws and a loss, and they will look to make amends with a win against Tim Sherwood's side. 

Both Taylor and Colback will miss the match at the weekend. The former is nursing a long-term Achilles tendon injury that will see him miss the rest of the season, while Colback's accumulation of yellow cards has earned him a two-game ban. 

Ed Sheeran (second right), one of the big winners of the night, was also at the party near Covent Garden

Krul was in goal for the Magpies last time out, when they got beaten 5-0 by Manchester City

Colback and Taylor will both not be involved on Saturday through suspension and injury respectively
