A drunk college student arrested for invading the pitch during a game of American football match tweeted about her drunken antics from her police cell.

Samantha Lynne Goudie, 22, was found to have a blood alcohol reading of 0.341 - four times the drink drive limit - when she was arrested during the match.

She had been watching the clash between Northern Illinois and Iowa at Kinnick Stadium, Iowa, when she leaped over the barrier and tried to run onto the field, according to the police report.

Match stewards pounced and handed her over to police who took her to the station and offered her a breathalyzer test.

'@vodka_samm': Samantha Goudie, 22, was charged with public intoxication on Saturday after police found her blood to be a third alcohol. Her Twitter handle is @vodka_samm

Noting that she appeared 'unsteady on 
her feet', officers could scarcely believe the meter when it flashed a 
reading more than four times over the 0.08BAC drink driving limit.

Her drunken antics would have largely passed unnoticed were it not for the fact that Goudie kept friends and family - and the rest of the world - posted throughout the evening with regular updates on Twitter.

Under the handle @vodka_samm, she began with a tweet from her police cell at 9.33pm, which read: 'Just went to jail. #yolo'

An hour later she tweeted: 'Blew a .341 in jail.'

Clearly impressed by the capacity of her liver, she bragged at 12.07am: 'I'm going to get .341 tattooed on me because it is so epic.'

Boasts: Her drunken antics would have largely passed unnoticed were it not for the fact that Goudie kept friends, family - and the rest of the world - posted throughout the evening with a series of regular updates on Twitter

Proud: But as her boasts began to circulate across Twitter, users attacked her for her shameless boasts, unleashing a torrent of abuse

Thick-skinned: But despite the abuse, the thick-skinned student remained defiant

Mum to the rescue: Luckily her mother was on hand to rescue her from jail and duly picked her up from the police station

But as her boasts began to circulate across Twitter, users attacked her for her shameless boasts, unleashing a torrent of abuse.

One wrote: '@Vodka_samm Doesn't have to use birth control because nothing can live in that much alcohol.'

Incredibly, Goudie proudly retweeted that message.

Many of the other tweets were too obscene to reproduce.

Still unperturbed, the thick-skinned student responded: 'I've gotten so many hate tweets because I was drunk...uh I get good grades sorry for being like every other college student'.

Luckily her mother was on hand to rescue her from jail and duly picked her up from the police station.

'My mom hates me right now,' she wrote.

Her police report read: 'Goudie, Samantha Lynne, 22 of Iowa City, IA for Public Intox at Kinnick 
Stadium at 1321 hours. Goudie was stopped for trying to enter the field.
Goudie was unsteady on her feet. Goudie blew .341 PBT.'
