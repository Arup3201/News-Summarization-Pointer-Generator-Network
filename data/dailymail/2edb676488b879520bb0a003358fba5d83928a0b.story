A Washington corrections officer whose wife discovered through a Facebook notification that he had married a second woman has pleaded guilty to attempted bigamy.

Alan O'Neill, 43, says he's 'embarrassed and remorseful,' the Tacoma News Tribune reports, but that it was all a mistake in paperwork that has since led to a humiliating and internationally reported scandal, and potentially the loss of his job.

Charged in March after his first wife Ellenora Fulk learned of his second through a Facebook 'people you may know' notification, Ms Fulk, who was estranged from him at the time, alerted authorities.

Busted: When Ellenora Fulk saw this picture on Teri Wyatt-O'Neill's Facebook page, she realised that the stranger was married to her husband, Alan O'Neill

Tipped off from that Facebook notification, the second woman's profile photo showed her and O'Neill dressed up whilesipping out of wine glasses beside a wedding cake.

'I’ve never done anything intentionally wrong in my life,' he told the Tribune.

His attorney claims he used a neighbour to process his divorce's paperwork from Ms Fulk but they failed to do so.

'Mr O'Neill failed to follow through on that,' Attorney Phillip Thornton said in court.

Wives: O'Neill first married Ms Fulk, left, then Ms O'Neill, right, but never divorced his first wife

But according to charges filed 
against him in March, when confronted about the wedding by his first 
wife, who first called his mother, he allegedly acknowledged them still 
being married only an hour later.

'...the defendant arrived at [Ms Fulk's] apartment, and she 
asked him several times if they were divorced,' court records show. 'The defendant said, "No, we are still married."'

According to those charges, he married Ms Fulk in 2001, moved out in 2009, changed his 
name and remarried without divorcing her.

O'Neill
was spared jail time but will be on probation for a year. He has 
annulled his second marriage and is divorcing his first wife.

Neither O'Neill nor Ms Fulk had filed
for divorce, according to charging documents. The name change came in 
December, and later that month he married Ms O'Neill.

O'Neill allegedly asked Ms Fulk not 
to tell anybody about his dual marriages and promised he would fix it, 
the documents state. She alerted authorities anyway.

His first wife wrote a letter supporting O'Neill, saying the media coverage has been enough punishment to him.

'He
just made a bad decision that hurt a few people’s feelings and 
(brought) embarrassment to himself,' she wrote, according to the 
Tribune.

O'Neill's future as a Pierce County jailer remains in question.
