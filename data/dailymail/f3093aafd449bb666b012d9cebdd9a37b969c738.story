A congressional candidate running as a Republican in the upcoming Illinois primary says the 'Holocaust never happened.'

Arthur Jones, 64, who organizes neo-Nazi events around Adolf Hitler’s birthday, hopes to be the Republican candidate chosen to run against Rep. Dan Lipinski in Illinois’ 3rd Congressional District.

‘As far as I’m concerned, the Holocaust is nothing more than an international extortion racket by the Jews,’ Jones said.

Controversial: Arthur Jones, a candidate running as a Republican in the Illinois primary, is a Holocaust denier

‘It’s the blackest lie in history. Millions of dollars are being made by Jews telling this tale of woe and misfortune in books, movies, plays and TV. The more survivors, the more lies that are told.’

Holocaust denial is illegal in a number of European countries and carries a prison sentence for people who break the law.

Jones, a Vietnam War veteran, was previously a member of the Nationalist Socialist White People's Party and has taken part in a Nazi march.

'Philosophically, I’m a National Socialist,' Jones said. 'Officially, I don’t belong to any party except my own, the America First Committee.'

Jones has already blown his retirement savings on two prior congressional runs – with no success.

Jones, an insurance salesman, also 
condemned fellow Republicans Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich and Mitt 
Romney as ‘war-mongering fools.’

He said: 'These war-mongering fools in congress like Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney—we can’t let Iran have one nuclear weapon but we let Israel have all the nuclear weapons they want. This is ridiculous.'

He claims that he is running again partly because of what he describes as Lipinski’s 'strange affiliation' with the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.

He describes the body as the 'American Israel Pro Israel Affairs Committee'.

The candidate also compares today's conditions in the United States to Germany at the end of World War I.

'Our country is falling apart economically, politically, culturally, militarily,' he said. 'We are going down.'

In an online questionnaire, Jones admitted he has been arrested for ‘minor street skirmishes with Leftists.’

The state Republican party has tried to keep the candidate off the ballot because of his anti-semitic views, even though he has gathered enough signatures to qualify.
