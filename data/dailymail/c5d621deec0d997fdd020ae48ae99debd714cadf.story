I'm fine: Dame Maggie Smith looking well while out and about in London on Monday, despite rumours she had been admitted to hospital with a heart scare

Downton Abbey star Dame Maggie Smith was pictured out and
about on Monday and confirmed she is ‘fine and well at home’, despite 
rumours she was rushed to hospital with a heart scare.

The reports had raised fears the actress would not be fit to film a new series of the hit drama.

Dame Maggie, 77, who plays Violet Crawley
in the drama, was reportedly admitted to a specialist cardiac unit last
Friday, after complaining of severe pains.

As the curtain came down on the third run of the popular ITV period drama on Sunday night, fears that the public's affection for show was on the wane couldn't have been further from the truth.

Figures released on Monday revealed that Downton’s latest outing was the most successful yet.

It appears packing the latest series with a number of cliffhangers snared back the viewers who looked to have deserted the show at the beginning and ensured it regained its title as the programme to watch for easy Sunday night viewing.

The death of Lady Sybil, one of the three Downton daughters, within hours of giving birth saw that episode beat the X Factor.

Other ratings winners included spinster daughter Edith being jilted at the altar and the last episode saw the introduction of a new character, Lady Rose, the great-niece of the Dowager Countess, played by Dame Maggie Smith.

She provokes scandal in the final episode by spending the evening with a married man in a dancing club. She is then shown being banished by her family to Scotland when the fling is exposed.

Overall the third series had averaged almost 9.5million viewers. The last episode got an average of about 10 million viewers and a peak audience of 10.7million.

This compares with the second series which had averaged 9.2million and the first which averaged 8.8million and finished on just over 10million.

The first series of Downton was set between 1912 and 1914 and then moved on to the period between 1916 and 1918 for the second series and the latest run was centred in the 1920s.

The show’s creator Julian Fellowes recently said in an interview that he plans to introduce Indian or black characters into the show.

He said it would be ‘rather nice to open the show up ethnically’ but added it would have to be historically believable.

Fourth series: Dame Maggie, 77, plays Violet Crawley, Dowager Countess of Grantham, in Downton Abbey, which managed 9.5m viewers for the third series

No official announcement has been made about a fourth series of Downton Abbey.

But at a recent talk about the drama, Hugh Bonneville said filming for the fourth series begins in February. He also revealed that there will be a Christmas episode again this year but that unlike last year it will not actually be set during the festive period.

Mr Bonnevile added: ‘It’s got a very different tone, time has moved on a bit by eight or nine months.’

Success: Despite fears that ratings would tail off, the cliffhanger endings to many episodes in the third series of Downton have kept fan viewers flocking back

Sir Peter Hall, who founded the Royal Shakespeare Company, has apologised to Downton Abbey star Laura Carmichael after apparently heckling her during a West End performance.Sir Peter allegedly shouted ‘Stop, stop stop’ and ‘It doesn’t work and you don’t work. It is not good enough. I could be at home watching television’ as Miss Carmichael delivered the final lines of Anton Chekhov’s Uncle Vanya.Sir Peter, 81, told Miss Carmichael, 26, who plays Lady Edith in Downton, that he had briefly fallen asleep and became confused when his wife woke him.‘I am mortified that I unintentionally disrupted the final scene,’ he added.

He said: ‘I genuinely don’t know what’s 
happening with any of our futures.  Dan (Stevens) is on Broadway at the 
moment and he finishes in February which is when we start filming series
4 so I am sure he’ll be back. But it does leave a big hole when a major
character leaves.’

At the weekend Downton creator Mr Fellowes admitted a fourth series of the period drama is likely.

He said he would be ‘surprised’ if a full fourth run did not happen adding he thought the third series had ‘worked well’.

Actor Brendan Coyle, who plays valet John Bates, has previously claimed the creators have decided when to end the drama. ‘I can pretty much say all of us know when Downton is going to end,’ he said. He added: ‘This is a show with a finite life.’

The opening episode of the latest series had attracted an average audience of 8.6million – which had been down 300,000 from the previous year’s series opener.
