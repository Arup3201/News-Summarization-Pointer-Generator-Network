Thanks to his portrayal of Stephen Hawking in The Theory Of Everything, Eddie Redmayne is tipped to win a number of awards in 2015.

And he's clinched his first already - although it's for his dapper dressing rather than his acting skills.

The 32-year-old British actor has been named GQ magazine's best dressed man thanks to his sharp suits and daring style choices.

Eddie, who tied the knot with Hannah Bagshawe last month, pipped fellow actors Benedict Cumberbatch and Jamie Dornan to the title, compiled by staff at the magazine and a panel of industry experts.

Here, FEMAIL reveal why Eddie deserves the accolade, even though he hasn't always got his style quite right...
