Admiral Lord West of Spithead was on board a cruise liner when the captain told him they had been threatened with a fine, if they did not lower the red ensign

A former First Sea Lord who served in the Falklands War has today accused Argentina of 'flexing its muscles', by banning all non-military British ships flying the 'red duster' flag.

Originating in the 17th century, the red ensign was flown by all Royal Navy vessels. But later it became the civil ensign for the United Kingdom.

Admiral Lord West of Spithead, who was at the helm of his frigate HMS Ardent when it was bombed and sunk during the Falklands war, was on a cruise earlier this month, when he learned of new laws imposed by the Argentinians.

He told Channel 4 news he was a passenger on Cunard's liner, the Queen Victoria cruise ship earlier this month when he discovered his old enemy had been 'flexing their muscles'.

He said while dining with the captain one night, she told how she had been threatened with a fine of $10,000, and warned 'there would be trouble', if she didn't take down the red flag.

The red duster, as it is known, is flown by all British non-military ships.

But Argentina's largest region has passed a law banning vessels flying the flag from docking in Buenos Aires.

'I think it’s an insult – it’s an insult to the nation,' Admiral West said, describing the provincial law as 'atrocious'.

The law is believed to apply only to ships that have travelled to the Falklands. As such, the Queen Victoria, should not have fallen foul of the new rule.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We 
condemn any attempts by the Argentine authorities to unnecessarily 
interfere with the legitimate transit of UK-flagged vessels…This appears
 to be another example of unacceptable harassment and intimidation…We 
are urgently discussing the matter with Carnival UK [Cunard's parent 
company] and will raise this with the Argentine authorities.'

Argentina's president Cristina 
Fernández de Kirchner stoked tensions with Britain when she called for 
David Cameron to hand the Falklands back to her country.

Admiral West - a Labour peer - said he plans to ask questions in parliament about the latest diplomatic incident.

A year later, West was promoted to Captian and given command of HMS Bristol.
