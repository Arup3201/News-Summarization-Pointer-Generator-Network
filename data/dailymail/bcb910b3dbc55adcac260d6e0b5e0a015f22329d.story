George Groves will put a potential world title fight on the backburner to fight Denis Douglin on the undercard of Nathan Cleverly's rematch with Tony Bellew.

Groves, who bounced back from successive defeats to Carl Froch with a points win over Christopher Rebrasse last month, will face the American at the Liverpool Echo Arena on November 22.

His win over Rebrasse earned him mandatory challenger status for the WBC belt currently held by Anthony Dirrell.

'I'm looking forward to getting back in the ring,' said Groves. 'This is a chance for me to impress on a big card. I plan to steal the show! It’s a calculated risk, lose this fight and I lose my shot at Dirrell. 

'But I want to stay active, I want to box as regularly as possible and I’m confident I can get the job done.

'I’ve good memories of fighting at the Echo Arena. It’s been a happy hunting ground for me in the past. I fought my third professional fight there against Paul Samuels and I picked up a lot of fans in Liverpool that night. 

'They’re a lively bunch and I hope to bump into a few of them when I’m back in November.' 

Groves won a points decision against Rebrasse and is keen to stay active as he awaits his title shot

Douglin has lost three of his 20 fights and is, rather uniquely, trained by his mum.

'This is a big opportunity for me,’' he said. 'Win this fight and I’m a step closer to realising my dream of becoming world champion. Groves is a great boxer, it will be a tough fight but I’m ready to cause an upset. I’m coming to fight my fight and to beat Groves on his home turf.'
