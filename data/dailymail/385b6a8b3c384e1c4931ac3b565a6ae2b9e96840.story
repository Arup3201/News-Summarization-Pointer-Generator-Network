Burnley are staying tight-lipped over the future of Liverpool target Danny Ings.

Reports on Monday suggested that the 22-year-old has signed a pre-contract with Real Sociedad and will join David Moyes’ side at the end of the season.

The England Under 21 striker, who has been widely linked with the Spanish club, will be out of contract in the summer and is free to talk to foreign teams.

Burnley have always maintained that he will not leave Turf Moor in this transfer window.

Liverpool were prepared to pay £4million for Ings and loan him back to the Clarets for the rest of the season before discovering that would be against Premier League rules.

Meanwhile, Burnley have moved to strengthen their central midfield by tabling a £3m offer for West Brom’s Graham Dorrans. Sean Dyche is also in the market for a winger.
