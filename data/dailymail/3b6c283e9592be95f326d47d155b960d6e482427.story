A mysterious object has been spotted flying through an Argentinian news broadcast, leading to claims of a UFO.

The disc-shaped object was seen moving across a studio backdrop during a live broadcast in Buenos Aires last week.

However, several outlets and experts are dismissing the claims of a UFO, pointing out several errors in the short clip.

The object was seen moving across what is purported to be a large widow during a studio broadcast from Todo Noticias, aka TN, an Argentinian cable news channel.

As the anchors discuss a topic on the daily agenda, a disc-shaped object is seen zooming across the skyline in the background.

The 'UFO' was first reported by MysteriousUniverse.org, who writes that the broadcast took place on February 28th before it was posted on Youtube.

Unfortunately for alien enthusiasts, there are several indications that the UFO is nothing but a hoax.

Several anomalies in the short clip indicates that the background in the studio has been tampered with.

'This was most likely an animation hoax because of some common editing errors that appear to be present,' Ben Hansen, the former lead investigator of the Syfy Channel's 'Fact or Faked: Paranormal Files', told the Huffington Post.

Raëlism, also known as Raelianism or the Raëlian movement, is a UFO religion that was founded in 1974.

The Raëlian Movement teaches that life on Earth was scientifically created by a species of extraterrestrials, which they call the Elohim.

Members of this species appeared human and when having personal contacts with the descendants of the humans they made, they previously misinformed (on purpose) early humanity that they were angels, cherubim or gods.

Raëlians believe messengers, or prophets, of the Elohim include Buddha,Jesus, and others who informed humans of each era. 

Hansen highlights two particular errors, one being proof that the UFO is superimposed on top of wires on an antenna mast at the 33-second mark, and the second that the UFO disappears before it supposedly flies behind a building.

He also highlights that if the station really had captured a flying alien vessel, he believes they would have either mentioned it during the live broadcast or used it later for publicity.

This comes just  a week after another alleged UFO spotting during a South American broadcast.

The production crew in Lima, Peru, were filming a programme when they interrupted it in order to  focus on what appears to be a 'UFO' hovering over the city.

The purple-colored disc-shaped object can be seen hovering in the  sky near a construction site, but so far, there has been no official explanation for the object.

Thousands of people have taken to social media to discuss what they think the mysterious purple object is and the video has already been viewed more than 100,000 times.
