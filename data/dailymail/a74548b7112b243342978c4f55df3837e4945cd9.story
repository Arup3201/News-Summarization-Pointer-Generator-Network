A U.S. police officer has been suspended after telling an African-American suspect he was pursuing that 'You're gonna get your ass shot, boy!'.

Seattle police released the dash cam video following a public disclosure request and 'in the interests of fostering better police transparency'.

The officer involved was suspended for 15 days.  

A U.S. police officer has been suspended for 15 days for telling an African-American suspect he was pursuing that 'You're gonna get your ass shot, boy!'

The dash cam video shows an officer on foot, left, chasing the offender who is a few meters ahead of him

The suspended officer, who is in the patrol car which recorded the video, closes in on the offender

The clip, from October 7, 2013, shows the officer pursuing an African-American suspect in his patrol car as the man runs through down town Seattle. 

The offender manages to evade the officer, who turns his car around at one point and chases him along the footpath, as he cackles loudly.

He is then heard saying: You're gonna get your ass shot, boy!'.

The offender then runs off down an alleyway before the officer catches him in his patrol car. He is then heard telling the man to 'stop' and 'back up' before yelling an expletive at him.

Half a dozen other officers then turn up to help arrest the man, who repeatedly tells his arresting officer than he is complying with his instructions, and to 'calm down'.

He then turns and runs in the opposite direction, the officer than cackles loudly before warning him that he risked getting 'your ass shot'

The offender eventually stops after being chased down the alleyway by the officer in the car

Seattle police said they did not receive any complaints from the public about the arrest, and released the video 'in the interests of fostering better police transparency'

Seattle police did not say what crime the man had committed, but an officer can be overheard on the video talking about 'locating the female victim'.

Before the video plays, Seattle police explain that 'no public complaint' ever surfaced about the incident. 

A front line supervisor had raised concerns with his mangers, the video explained, and the officer involved was then investigated by the office of Professional Accountability.

The video goes on to say that the Seattle police department 'implemented a new bias free policing program' that was mandatory for all officers, and issued a new 'bias free policing policy'.

'The department is committed to constitutional and equitable policing for all of Seattle's residents', the video said.
