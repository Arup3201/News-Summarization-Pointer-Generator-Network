A former teacher who was found dead at her home left a suicide note blaming a routine procedure carried out at a leading cosmetic surgery clinic for making her life ‘hell’.

Victoria Meppen-Walter, 44, spiralled into depression after being left with what she described as ‘dreadful facial deformities’ when a mole was removed from her forehead.

She took an overdose of pills after typing a note blaming her cosmetic surgeon for her impending death and asking that his name be engraved on her headstone as a reminder of her suffering.

'Suffering': Mrs Meppen-Walter, pictured on a family holiday in 2008, said that she was left unable to leave the house after she suffered pain and facial redness

Aftermath: Mrs Meppen-Walker with a plaster on her forehead following the procedure in September 2011

Allegations: Mrs Meppen-Walter asked her husband for the surgeon's name to be included in the inscription on her gravestone

In a series of notes, Mrs 
Meppen-Walter complained that she had been left with severe pain from 
‘burning flesh in the face, neck and chest’ and spoke of a ‘regular 
stabbing pain’ in her forehead.

She
said her life had become ‘hell’ because she was unable to leave her 
home after her face was left so severely deformed that friends did not 
recognise her.

In her final note, which was addressed to her husband Ashley, 64, she wrote: ‘Life is for enjoyment not for endless suffering.’

The
letter, written in July, made requests for her funeral and said: ‘What I
would appreciate though is this inscription: “Died as a result of 
malice caused by Dr [name blacked out] of Transform in Sep 2011.”’

But
the world-renowned Transform Clinic, in Altrincham, Greater Manchester,
said it provided a ‘high standard’ of care for Mrs Meppen-Walter and 
the surgeon involved said he had successfully carried out many similar 
procedures.

Company 
director Mr Meppen-Walter, who found the note at the family home in 
Heywood, Greater Manchester, said his wife of 17 years ‘couldn’t take 
any more’.

Procedure: Mrs Meppen-Walter complained of 'endless suffering' after having moles removed in a procedure at the Transform Clinic in Cheshire

‘It was only 
supposed to be a 25-minute procedure,’ he said. ‘But during the 
operation she said there was a lot of blood pouring from her head. A few
weeks after the procedure she realised she had been left with a scar. 
She presumed it would fade away in time but it didn’t.

‘She said she was in a lot of pain. She would sit there with her head in her hands and her eyes closed.’

Mr
Meppen-Walter, a father of three, said his wife began to lack 
confidence and became a complete recluse following the surgery. Then she
began to talk about suicide.

He
reported her missing on August 30 after she disappeared two days 
earlier and he found her disturbing notes. Officers searched the house 
but did not find a body.

Her
body remained undiscovered for a further three days in an unused locked
front room of their £500,000 home. It was eventually found by Mr 
Meppen-Walter’s son, who climbed in through a window.

Initially
Mr Meppen-Walter, his 24-year-old daughter Ainsley and a man aged 24 
were arrested on suspicion of murder. They were released shortly 
afterwards without charge. A spokesman for Transform said: ‘The 
treatment we provided was of a high standard. It was apparent her issues
were more deep rooted than with the actual treatment and care we 
provided.’

The surgeon who 
carried out the procedure said Mrs Meppen-Walter had a form of skin 
cancer. He also said she had been having psychiatric care and ‘we had to
get the police involved as she had been causing difficulty for members 
of our staff and myself’.

Mrs Meppen-Walter was the step-gran of former Manchester City player Courtney Meppen-Walter, who was jailed for 16 months after killing two people in a car crash.
