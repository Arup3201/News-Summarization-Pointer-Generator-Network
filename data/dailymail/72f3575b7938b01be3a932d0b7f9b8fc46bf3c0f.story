A taste of Spanish tradition came to Virginia on Saturday, as 4,000 people converged on a town for the chance to run with bulls.

The Great Bull Run had its debut on a converted drag-racing strip in Virginia, attracting a few thousand brave - or foolish - competitors wanting to recreate the Pamplona festival.

Wearing fancy dress or traditional white shirts and red scarves, between 500 and 700 runners a time would dash down the quarter of a mile track, with 12 1,000lb bulls in hot pursuit.

'It was a rush ... a shot of adrenalin,' 22-year-old Cat Jones said.

'I just didn't want to die, to get trampled by bulls and die,' the New Yorker told NBC News.

Runners paid about $60 for the chance to take part and had to sign a waiver absolving the organizers of liability if they got hurt.

One man was taken to hospital after being knocked to the ground and trampled and another had medical treatment after falling.

About 8,000 spectators turned out to 
watch the event, which is due to tour other states including Texas, 
Florida, California and Pennsylvania.

Most people who took part were aged between 18 and 40 and nearly half were women.

Rob Dickens, co-founder of the Great Bull Run, said people were attracted to the event for the chance of 'doing something dangerous and living to tell the tale'. 

'I’m 50 years old. There are no more dragons left to slay. It’s time to do something a little crazy,' Bill Slaughter told the Richmond Times Dispatch.

Inspiration: The Great Bull Run is based on Pamplona's annual festival

A 25-year-old, whose grandfather had run with bulls in Pamplona, added: It’s in our blood. It’s exciting to be living what our grandparents did.'

Animal rights groups, including Peta, had protested against the bull run, but the organizers claimed none of the animals were hurt.

'Bull runs mean collisions, falls, broken legs, trampling, and other potentially fatal outcomes for everyone involved, from the bulls to the bystanders,' Peta's Delcianna Winders said.
