Diego Costa has been left out of Spain's squad in a move which is sure to delight Jose Mourinho.

The Chelsea boss has slammed the national side's use of his star striker, who struggled with injury after the previous international break. 

'Diego has the hamstring (problem) because he played two matches in three days when he was not with us,' Mourinho said in October.

And when asked whether Costa's problems were now over, Mourinho added: 'But he still has (to play for) the national team in November.'

But Vincente del Bosque has now left the hitman out of his 23-man squad to face Belarus and Germany due to the ongoing row with Mourinho over his fitness. 

'We have reached the decision with doctors from Chelsea. He is taking a break because of discomfort in his pelvis,' the Spain manager said.

Flavour of the month at Real Madrid, Isco, comes into the squad, as does Celta Vigo forward Nolito and Malaga midfielder Ignacio Camacho.

There is still no place in the side for Manchester United playmaker Juan Mata or his City rival Jesus Navas, while Andres Iniesta, David Silva and Dani Carvajal are all ruled out through injury.
