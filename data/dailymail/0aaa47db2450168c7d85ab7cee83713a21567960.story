David Cameron has renewed speculation about his tendency to ‘chillax’ on the job as he broke off his trade trip to India to play cricket.

The Prime Minister began his visit with the biggest business delegation in history by revealing that he stays sane by having a good night’s sleep and employing good staff to do the work for him.

He also claimed he would be watching Bollywood films on the flight out.

Breaktime: The Prime Minister took some time out from talks to bat at Mumbai's Oval Maidan yesterday just hours after he confessed he has no time for the workaholic habits of his predecessors

Success: Mr Cameron scored several runs before being cleaned bowled in a game he appeared to enjoy

But he had been in Mumbai - the capital of Indian commerce - for just seven hours before he sloped off to Mumbai’s famous Oval Maidan, a vast square where several games are played at once.

The cricket-loving Prime Minister wielded the bat against some ferocious deliveries from local youngsters who flock to the recreation ground in the centre of the city to play.

After a few lusty blows, Mr Cameron’s middle stump was removed by a young bowler named Sachin - named after Mr Cameron’s own cricketing hero Sachin Tendulkar, the legendary cricketer who once gave Mr Cameron a signed bat.

Mr Cameron’s technique won approving comments from members of the England women’s squad, who have been helping train boys and girls through the ECB-backed Global Cricket School while in town for the World Cup.

Work and play: The PM told an audience at the headquarters of 
Unilever in Mumbai that he would be 'hopeless' if he allowed himself to 
become 'exhausted and fried mentally' by overwork

‘He’s got used the rough surface very quickly,’ said former England captain Clare Connor, adding ‘that’s a brilliant cover drive’, just before Mr Cameron almost got himself out.

School boss Sachin Bajaj said: ‘The PM was very chilled out, he was all smiles and very relaxed.‘He said he hadn’t had a hit for a long time but he got going and hit a few good cover drives.’

The Prime Minister’s cricketing sojourn came just hours after he confessed he has no time for the workaholic habits of his predecessors Margaret Thatcher and Gordon Brown.

Lady Thatcher famously survived on four hours a night during her premiership.

Mr Cameron called on India to further open up to foreign investment and said he wanted the two countries to have a 'special relationship'

But
Mr Cameron told an audience at the headquarters of Unilever in Mumbai 
that he would be 'hopeless' if he allowed himself to become 'exhausted 
and fried mentally' by overwork.

Asked
how he copes with the job, Mr Cameron said: ‘In terms of how I try to 
keep body and soul together, I try to stay a little bit fit.

‘So I try to go for a run a week, I try to play a game of tennis every week and I try not to go to bed too late.

‘Like
all these things, that doesn’t always work, but the most important 
thing is to have a very good team around you to make sure you can 
delegate and have a team you can work with and get things done for you.’

David Cameron arrived in India with what he called Britain's biggest ever overseas business delegation for a three-day visit

David Cameron launched an attack on 'aggressive' tax avoidance today.

The Prime Minister said the Government wanted to keep business taxes low so long as businesses paid their fair share.

But he said it would be 'difficult' for new laws to force companies to pay their taxes.

Mr Cameron has made transparency over tax a key priority of Britain's presidency of the G8 group of world economic powers this year, after a series of controversies over the arrangements of huge companies which were shown to be paying little tax in the UK.

He told an audience at the Unilever headquarters in Mumbai that the government are cutting the rate of corporation tax on company profits down to 21 per cent.

He said: 'The message to business should be, "If we are cutting this rate of tax down to a good low level, you should be paying that rate of tax, rather than seeking ever more aggressive ways to avoid it".'

'I think the problem with that is that there are some forms of tax avoidance that have become so aggressive that there are moral questions that we have to answer about whether we want to encourage or allow that sort of behaviour.'

'Some would say, "Just change the law to make aggressive avoidance illegal", but, with respect to my friends in the accountancy profession, it is difficult to do that.'

He added: ‘If you are exhausted and if you are fried mentally, you will be a hopeless prime minister.

‘You have to try to keep a good equilibrium and balance and then hopefully you can make good decisions.’

The
PM was embarrassed by a recent biography which quoted a friend saying: 
‘If there was an Olympic gold medal for chillaxing, Dave would win it.’

Mr
Cameron also faced embarrassment at Unilever when he failed to name a 
single one of the multinational company’s products - which include 
Marmite, Persil and PG Tips - when asked which ones he buys.

Attempting
to be diplomatic, the PM said: ‘We have very similar brands in the UK. I
don’t want to start a flurry of excitement by saying I use Pears soap 
or whatever it is.

'I might get some of your brands wrong and mention a 
dishwasher liquid we use and find out it’s made by your competitor.

'So, I’m going to do that thing politicians always do when they get a really tough one - and dodge the question.’

The
Prime Minister also unveiled plans to offer Indians a ‘same-day’ visa 
service so that business people can travel to the UK more easily.

The move comes in response to unhappiness with the current system – it can take three days or more to process applications.

But
it will provoke claims that the tough line Mr Cameron strikes at home 
on immigration is not matched when wooing foreigners to Britain.

He
also said there was ‘no limit’ to the number of Indians who would be 
allowed to study at UK universities and stay on in graduate-level jobs 
after they qualified.

Mr 
Cameron said in Mumbai that his government had been forced to ‘turn 
around an immigration system that was completely broken’ by shutting 
down the ‘bogus colleges’ which thousands of migrants were using to 
enter the country.

But now,
he said, there would be ‘no limit on the number (of students) that can 
come’ from India to study at Britain’s ‘world class’ universities.

He
also called on the Indian government to be more open to British 
investment and to sweep away barriers to trade which were holding back 
development in India.
