Kabir Ahmed was the first person in the UK to be convicted of 'distributing threatening written material to stir up hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation'

A British ISIS fighter in Syria who told BBC's Panorama programme he wanted to be a suicide bomber has been twice convicted for spreading hatred against gay people in the UK.

Kabir Ahmed, of Normanton, Derby, who claimed to be called Abu Sumayyah on Panorama, was the first person in the UK to be convicted of 'distributing threatening written material to stir up hatred on the grounds of sexual orientation'.

He told BBC reporters that he wanted to be 'put up the (suicide bomber) list'.

Ahmed, 30, was sentenced to 15-month in February 2012 after a trial heard how he handed out leaflets outside a mosque showing a mannequin hanging from a tree next to the words 'Death Penalty?' in relation to gay people.

During the trial, the court heard how the group's activities intimidated residents and left gay people frightened to walk on the streets.

The first leaflet, entitled 'Death penalty?' proclaimed that 'Allah permits the destruction' of gay people and that 'the only question is how it should be carried out'.

The second, entitled ‘Turn or Burn’, featured a burning figure in a blazing lake of fire and warned that the decriminalisation of homosexuality was 'the root of all problems'.A third, entitled 'GAY - God Abhors You', warned of 'severe punishment' for homosexuals.

A fourth leaflet linked to the group, which was never distributed, described homosexuality as a 'vile, ugly, cancerous disease'. It referred to 'queer sinners' and 'faggots' and posed the question 'Gay Today, Paedophile Tomorrow?'

Later the same year, while still in jail, he was convicted of holding up homophobic placards and chanting 'we hope you die of Aids' to revellers at Derby’s Gay Pride procession.

Community leaders in Derby say Ahmed was a 'maverick' one-off who was probably radicalised outside Derby when he moved away to study.

Police confirmed that Ahmed is the same person who now calls himself the ISIS fighter Abu Sumayyah.

In a short Skype interview broadcast on BBC’s Panorama, Ahmed said: 'Everyone’s got their name on the list (to become a suicide bomber) and everyone is asking the Emir (leader) to push their name up. Everyone wants to fight for the sake of Allah.'

It has been reported that he left his wife and three children in Derby a year ago and is currently at a training camp in Syria.

Ahmed has changed his name to Abu Sumayyah and fights with ISIS (stock picture taken of ISIS fighters in Syria in June). He told BBC's Panorama: 'Everyone’s got their name on the list 
(to become a suicide bomber)

The Mirror claims Sumayyah spoke to a pro-ISIS internet station last month, telling them life with the group is 'better than that game Call of Duty'.

A spokesman for Derbyshire Police said: 'Derbyshire Police believe that Abu Sumayyah, who has appeared in the media in recent weeks, is also known as Kabir Ahmed who previously lived in Derby. We are monitoring the situation.'

In his Panorama interview, Ahmed claimed about 500 British men had joined ISIS.

He said: 'If the British commits terror against our people, is unjust towards our people, kills, murders and rapes our people then you can expect attacks on your soil. If you support our enemies against us then you can expect these attacks, and so can America and so can any other country.'

Leader of Derby City Council Ranjit Banwait, who grew up in Derby, said the council and police were working with community groups and schools on educating young people about the dangers of radicalisation.

No one at both Ahmed’s family home in Derby and the house in the city he shared with his wife and child, were willing to comment.
