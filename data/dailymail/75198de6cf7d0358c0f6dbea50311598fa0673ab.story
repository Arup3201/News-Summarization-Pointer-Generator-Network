Eight schools across three New England states have been forced to evacuate students after receiving bomb threats in just the past four days.

It all began Wednesday morning, when a bomb threat led to the evacuation of the Sandy Hook Elementary School in Monroe, Connecticut.

That same day, Ross A. Lurgio Middle School and Bedford High School in Bedford, New Hampshire and Bedford High School in Bedford, Massacusetts were all evacuated for the same reason.

Then, this morning, Westwood High School, Thurston Middle School, and Xaverian Brothers High School, in Westwood, Massachusetts received threats as well.

Number 2: Sandy hook Elementary had a bomb threat called in Wednesday morning

First: Franklin High School in Franklin, Massachusetts had a bomb threat emailed in Tuesday morning

Authorities are still uncertain if these threats are connected or just some awful coincidence.

A bomb threat was also emailed to Franklin High School in Franklin, Massachusetts on Tuesday morning, again forcing an evacuation, but principal Peter Light quickly realized it was a hoax after searching the school.  

At Sandy Hook,  Monroe Police Lt. Brian McCauley says the threat was called in to the school at 9:30 a.m. and the evacuation was ordered as a precaution.

He says the school building and grounds were checked and no evidence of danger was found. 

The former Chalk Hill Middle School in Monroe, Connecticut was repurposed for use by Sandy Hook students after their school in Newtown became the backdrop for America's most horrific school shooting to date in 2012. 

Number three: Bedford High School in Bedford, Massachusetts received a bomb threat via email

Number four: Another Bedford High School, this one in new Hampshire, received a threat that day as well

Number five: Ross A. Lurgio Middle School in Bedford, New Hampshire was also evacuated

That same day in Bedford, New Hampshire, Principal William Hagen received a bomb threat via email, and cancelled classes at the high school as well as Ross A. Lurgio Middle School.

It contained some details in it that gave us pause,' McGee said, including the time that the threat would be carried out, which McGee said was in the afternoon according to the New Hampshire Union Leader.

After an intense search, authorities determined there was no evidence a bomb had been planted.

The fourth school to receive a threat that day was also in Bedford, but this time Bedford, Massachusetts, as Bedford High School was evacuated after, again, an email threat.

And, again, authorities found no reason to believe there was a bomb. 

Number six: Students at Thurston Middle School in Westwood, Massachusetts, were told to shelter in place after a threat this morning

Number seven: Nearby Westwood High School was evacuated

Number eight: The most recent to receive a threat is Xaverian Brothers High School, also in Westwood

Now this morning three more schools, Westwood High School, Thurston Middle School, and Xaverian Brothers High School, all in Westwood, Massachusetts, received threats, though students at Thurston were not evacuated and instead told to shelter in place.

Once again, the threat came over email.

Public safety officials determined the threat to be unsubstantiated, Westwood High School Principal Sean Bevan told WCVB.

After the incidents that happened on Wednesday, the FBI announced it would be investigationg further into the threats in both Bedford towns.

It seems likely that investigation will also include Westwood now. 

There have been no arrests made in any of the cases.
