Jailed: Vanessa Marie Yanez, 24, struck cycling postal worker Jesse Dotson Jr. while driving along El Segundo Boulevard, California, on June 26 last year

The daughter of a LAPD sergeant who attempted to cover up a fatal hit-and run by reporting the car stolen has been jailed for two years.

Vanessa Marie Yanez, 24, struck postal worker Jesse Dotson Jr. while driving along El Segundo Boulevard, near Vermont Avenue, in Gardena, California, on the night of June 26 last year.

Mr Dotson, 60, who had been riding his bicycle, was taken to hospital but died of his injuries three days later.

Yanez, who admitted she had been drinking before the collision, failed to stop and told Huntington Park Police Department the next morning that her vehicle had been stolen.

But a police officer had seen news reports of the collision and notified Gardena police about Yanez’s possible connection, the Los Angeles Times reports. 

Yanez’s car was found with its windshield shattered at her family home less than a mile from the crash site and is said to have surrendered to police when they went to her address.

In August, she pleaded no contest to two felony counts - leaving the scene of a crash and perjury. She later pleaded no contest to vehicular manslaughter.

Yanez is the daughter of LAPD Sergeant Arturo Yanez - and the veteran police officer is currently the subject of an internal investigation into whether he had any role in his daughter's attempt to cover up the crime. 

LAPD said the investigation in ongoing, NBC reports.

Addressing Yanez in court, Mr Dotson's sister, Annette Dotson Woodard, said: 'You left my brother for dead. All along you knew you hit a human being.

'All you had to do was stop. This could have been avoided had you stopped. Just a few seconds may have meant my brother's life.'

The hit-and-run victim's wife, Lorna Dotson, added: 'We loved him. It's really despicable that that's a child of law enforcement. Somebody that should have taught their child to do the right thing.'

The family believe that Yanez’s two-year sentence was far too lenient, but with no criminal history prosecutors claimed the maximum six year term was always unlikely.
