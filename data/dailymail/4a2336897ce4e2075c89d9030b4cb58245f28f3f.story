Manchester United striker Radamel Falcao remains determined to break back into Louis van Gaal's starting XI despite talk of a permanent move to Juventus this summer.

The Colombian, who is currently on loan at Old Trafford from Monaco, has failed to impress this season and has not started a game since the 2-0 win against Sunderland on February 28.

Juventus are keen on the former Atletico Madrid man, with the Serie A side having opened talks with Monaco about a deal earlier this month.

However, Falcao is refusing to discuss a move to Italy and insists he is concentrating on helping United finish the season strongly by grabbing a Champions League place.

'Juventus looking for me? They talk a lot, but now I'm focused 100 per cent on Manchester United,' he told Radio Caracol.

The 29-year-old has just four Premier League goals in 19 games but he remains hopeful of breaking back into Van Gaal's plans for the last eight games. 

Falcao added: 'Before the end of the season there are some crucial matches and I hope that this situation will change.'

Falcao has struggled for form since joining Manchester United and looks unlikely to stay beyond this season
