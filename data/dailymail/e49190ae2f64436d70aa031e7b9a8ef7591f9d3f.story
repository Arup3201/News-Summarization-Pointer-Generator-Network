Three Americans being held by the North Korean government have given their second interview from captivity in Pyongyang and said their plight is 'urgent.'

Matthew Todd Miller, Jeffrey Edward Fowle and Kenneth Bae begged the U.S. government for help - asking that the State Department send a special envoy to North Korea to negotiate on their behalf.

A CNN TV crew and the Associated Press were given access to the men Monday. It is only the second time that Mr Miller and Mr Fowle have been seen by Western media since they were detained in April.

Kenneth Bae, who has been detained in North Korea for nearly two years, said he works in a labor camp six days a week, eight hours a day

Both men said they face trial in a month and will likely be sent to prison immediately thereafter. Mr Bae has been held since November 2012 and was convicted in April 2013 of forming a Christian plot to overthrow the government.

'My situation is very urgent, that very soon I am going to trial, and I would directly be sent to prison,' Mr Miller told CNN.

He was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor and currently works eight hours a day, six days a week at a camp in Pyongyang, he said.

Mr Miller was detained after he arrived at Pyongyang Sunan International Airport and tore up his tourist visa. He reportedly requested asylum in the hermit kingdom and said he had chosen North Korea 'as a shelter.'

Mr Fowle, a father-of-three from Ohio, is accused of leaving a Bible at a nightclub during a tourist trip to North Korea.

Last month, Mr Miller appeared humbled on video. No looking into the camera, he said: 'I am now requesting help from the American government, the citizens of America and the world to release me from this situation.'

Mr Miller and Mr Fowle are being held at a hotel in Pyongyang and said they are allowed outside for on hour each day and given three meals a day.

Mr Bae said that despite being forced to work in a labor camp, he is being treated 'as humanely as possible.' In a truly North Korean twist, he revealed that he is the only worker at the labor camp and his labor is supervised by 20 government officials - including guards and a doctor.

He asked Americans to pray for him and that he is allowed to return hoe to the United States.

All three men said they have signed confessions after being coerced by their captors.

A CNN TV crew was in Pyongyang as part of a government-sponsored tour of the country. Reporter Will Ripley said in the midst of an activity, he and his crew were whisked away in an unmarked van and told they would be meeting with a top North Korean official.

When they arrived at a Pyongyang hotel, they found not an official, but instead, the three American captives. CNN was allowed to speak to each captive for five minutes. 

This is the second time in two months, Western media has been allowed access to the hostages. Last month, Mr Miller and Mr Fowle met with an AP news crew and gave similar interviews.

A State Department official told MailOnline last month: 'Out of humanitarian concern for Mr Miller, Mr Fowle, and their families, we request the DPRK (North Korea) release them so they may return home.'

The United States has no embassy in North Korea - but is working through the Swedish embassy in Pyongyang to keep in touch to the captives and help secure their release.

The State Department said officials are in 'regular contact' with the families of the two detained men.

Little is known about Mr Miller. The State Department has refused to say where he is from or identify his family.

North
 Korea's state-run media have said the 24-year-old entered the country 
April 10 with a tourist visa, but tore it up at the airport and shouted 
that he wanted to seek asylum.

He traveled to North Korea after purchasing a private tour of Uri Tours, a New Jersey-based company that runs tours to the reclusive nation.

In an update in April posted to the company's website, Uri Tours said it had repeatedly tried to reach the family member Mr Miller listed a his emergency contact information, had gotten no response.

To date, no members of Mr Miller's family have come forward publicly to ask for his release.
