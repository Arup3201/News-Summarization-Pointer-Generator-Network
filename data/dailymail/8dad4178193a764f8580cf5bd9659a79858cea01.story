Family: Prime Minister David Cameron with his youngest child Florence

David Cameron has indicated he is ‘perfectly happy’ for him and his family to eat genetically modified foods that have been deemed safe by watchdogs.

Sources close to the Prime Minister said he took the same view as Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, who said this week that he had eaten GM foods and would happily feed his children a genetically modified tomato.

As the Government launched a push to end an effective ban on GM products in British supermarkets, Downing Street repeatedly declined to say whether Mr Cameron would eat them or give them to his family.

But yesterday a source close to the Prime Minister told the Mail: ‘Of course he would happily eat GM products that have been through proper procedures.

‘Anyone who has ever eaten a meal in the United States has almost certainly eaten GM, since almost all the soya produced there has been genetically modified for many years.

‘The point is we can’t carry on damning an entire technology as “Frankenstein foods”. Surely the sensible thing is to judge each product on its merits or demerits.’ 

Mr Paterson prompted a row with critics of GM foods this week when he insisted that they are safer than those produced using conventional farming methods.

He blamed European resistance to the technology for depriving the Third World of products such as ‘golden rice’, which is engineered to contain high levels of vitamin A to help prevent blindness.

Controversy: Environment secretary Owen Paterson viewing a genetically modified crop trial in Hertfordshire

Ministers claim British farmers and scientists are being forced to work with ‘one hand tied behind their backs’ because of an effective moratorium on GM products, which has been in place since they became the focus of controversy in the 1990s.

Mr Paterson insisted there was ‘no scientific evidence associating GMOs [genetically modified organisms] with higher risks’ for the environment or human health.

He said studies showed that the use of ‘more precise technology and the greater regulatory scrutiny probably makes GMOs even safer than conventional plants and food’.

Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, Dr Doug Parr, said it was ‘hard to take lessons on science’ from Mr Paterson and added that biotechnology not using genetic modification was already making a ‘real difference’.
