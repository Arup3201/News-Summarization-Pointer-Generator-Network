They've been locked away in dusty archives for decades but now the wills and fortunes of Australia’s pioneers and earliest celebrities are available online for anyone to see.

Among the 400,000 wills dated from 1800 – 1952, which are stored in the NSW State Records Authority in western Sydney, are the final wishes of billionaire casino mogul James Packer’s great grandfather.

Robert Clyde Packer, a successful journalist who founded the Packer media dynasty, died on April 12, 1934 and left behind an estate of £54,306 for his family - a huge $5,658,000 in today’s money.

Robert Packer was born in Tasmania on July, 24, 1879 and worked as a journalist first in Hobart and then around the country before arriving in Sydney where he launched the first Miss Australia beauty contest at the Daily Guardian in 1926.

He died of heart failure at age of 54 while cruising around the Mediterranean.

Billionaire casino mogul James Packer's great grandfather was the man responsible for launching their successful media dynasty. Robert Clyde Packer was Australian media tycoon Kerry Packer's (right) grandfather

In his will, he instructs that his wife Ethel Maud Packer is given ‘all my plate, linen, china, glass, books, pictures, prints and other house-hold effects (excluding however any motor cars) and also all my jewellery and articles of personnel adornment’.

He also requests that his trustees carry on employing his secretary Evelyn Mary Follett at a rate of $5 per week.

'[She] has given me loyal and efficient service,' he stated. 

Robert Packer’s will is just one of the 400,000 that are now available to view online after one of Australia’s leading historical records providers Findmypast.com.au spent 18 months digitising them.

Also retrieved from the archives is the final financial statement of Hollywood actor Mel Gibson’s paternal grandmother.

Australian-born Eva Gibson died in the United States without officially lodging a will, but records exist in the NSW files because her estate had to be distributed. The sum of ‘$131-13’ is lodged as her final wealth on her file.

The details on the letter of administration written after Eva Gibson, née Mylott, died simply reads:

The estate of the said deceased were granted to the public trustee interstate. Died 20th March 1920 - estate given at £131-13.

Actor and director Mel Gibson, 59, followed in his famous grandmother's footsteps by joining the world of showbusiness  

Eva Gibson, née Mylott, was a well-known opera singer and protégé of operatic soprano Dame Nellie Melba, one of the most famous singers of the late Victorian Era and the early 20th century.

Mrs Gibson was born in Tuross Head, NSW, to Irish immigrant parents and later moved to England to pursue her showbiz career. 

In 1917, she married businessman John Hutton Gibson in New York and they had two children together, one of whom - Hutton Gibson - is Mel Gibson's father. 

Mrs Gibson died in 1920, aged 44, in Chicago, after slipping in the shower and injuring her neck.

Aviator Sir Charles Edward Kingsford Smith – the man who Sydney’s international airport is named after - disappeared while flying from Allahabad, India, to Singapore over the Andaman Sea in the early hours of 8 November 1935

Sir Charles Edward Kingsford Smith  lovingly gave the whole of his estate ‘both real and personal of whatsoever nature wheresoever situation unto my wife the said Mary Kingsford Smith’

Along with the relatives of today's famous faces, the will of the first Prime Minister of Australia, Sir Edmund Barton, is also now available to view online.

It lists how the former Justice of the High Court bequeathed all of his law books to his eldest son, who also later went on to become a NSW judge.

Sir Edmund vowed to pay £40 per annum to his wife and left all his ‘trinkets and jewellery’ to his daughter Leila Stephanie, one of his six children.

Sir Edmund died from heart failure aged 70, on January 7, 1920, in a NSW hotel.

‘From a historical point of view, people can look at their ancestors and learn details that you would never know unless there were rumours from the family,’ Vicki Dawson, Country Manager for Findmypast.com.au, told Daily Mail Australia.

Although the digitised wills come from archives based in NSW, they belong to people from around the world.

'This is the last will and testament of me The Right Honourable Sir Edmund Barton, a judge of the High Court of Australia. I invoke all other Wills and testamentary dispositions at any time...

I bequeath to my wife Jane Barton my snuff box, the gift to me of his present majesty the King.

I bequeath to my son Arnold Hubert Barton the sum of forty pounds.

I bequeath to my son Oswald Barton my gold watch and chain.

I bequeath to my daughter Jean Alice wife of the said David Maughan all my books not being law books

I bequeath all my trinkets and jewellery not here in before disposed of to my daughter Leila Stephanie Barton.

I direct my trustees to value the whole of my law book and on my decease to give possession of such law books to my son Edmund Alfred Barton.'

The will of the first Prime Minister of Australia, Sir Edmund Barton, is also now available to view online

In his will, Sir Barton vowed to pay a sum of £40 per annum to his wife until the agreed value was reached

Australian military commander and civil engineer Sir John Monash, who was born to German Jewish parents and was widely considered to have been one of the best allied commanders of the First World War, was very generous with his bequeaths and included money to cousins, siblings and friends.

His will shows he was particularly fond of his son-in-law, noting: ‘To my son-in-law the sum of £1000 as a special mark of my esteem and affection.’

Sir John died on October 8, 1931, in Melbourne, from a heart attack and received a state funeral attended by an estimated 300,000 mourners.

Meanwhile, aviator Sir Charles Edward Kingsford Smith – the first person to fly across the Pacific from the United States to Australia - gave the whole of his estate ‘both real and personal of whatsoever nature wheresoever situation unto my wife the said Mary Kingsford Smith’.

Sir Sidney Kidman (left), who owned huge amounts of land in Australia, left a wealthy estate when he died in 1935. Brave Prussian explorer Ludwig Leichhardt's (right) will was not acted on until 20 years after his disappearance when he was presumed dead

The aviator, who also made the first non-stop flight across Australia, disappeared while trying to break the flight speed record from England to Australia. His will was distributed six months later.

The will states he was ‘presumed deceased on or after 7th day of November 1935’, which was the day he disappeared.

Brave Prussian explorer Ludwig Leichhardt, who famously vanished in the outback during his 1848 expedition and whose fate remains one of Australia’s greatest mysteries, did not have his will acted upon until 20 years later.

Leichhardt’s estate was finally left to his nephew when he was presumed dead and his survival was ruled out. No body was ever found. 

Children's author Rudyard Kipling's will is also held in NSW despite him being  English. Kipling died on 8 January 1936 at the age of 70,

In Rudyard Kipling's will he asks that his body be cremated and asks that his agent of 40 years be consulted 'in all matters connected with the disposition of my literary property' 

‘These Will Books are incredibly useful to family historians,’ said Carole Riley, Vice President of the Society of Australian Genealogists. 

‘Not only do the wills give insight into the family relationships and economic success of our ancestors, but their new accessibility can help us determine whether we have found the right ancestor in the first place. 

'We can see what they owned that they considered worthy of passing on, and which of their relatives they considered worthy of the inheritance.'
