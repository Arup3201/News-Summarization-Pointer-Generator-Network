A NBA star has decided to give up his celebratory six-shooter gesture in the wake of the Sandy Hook school massacre.

Joakim Noah, 27, who plays for the Chicago Red Bulls, has not used his trademark move since the attack last Friday where 20 children aged six and seven died along with six teaching staff.

The player, who earned $11million this year, had celebrated success on the court by miming guns with his index fingers.

During the Bulls last game against Boston Celtics, which the Chicago team won 100-89, Noah did not once make the gesture - or at two other games in the past week.

The player had been performing the celebration since the 2010-11 season.

He told the New York Post: 'It was kind of like a funny, comical thing. But I guess we’re in a situation right now where it’s not funny.'

He said that the high level of gun violence in Chicago added to his decision.

On December 14, the star player tweeted: 'This is so f***** up... There needs to be some kind of gun control.. For real.'

Joakim Noah has established a charity called Noah's Arc Foundation which helps underprivileged children through sports and arts programs.

New York Giants receiver Victor Cruz has visited the home of the six-year-old Connecticut shooting victim who was buried in a replica of his jersey.

Jack Pinto was among 20 children shot to death Friday in Newtown. Several elementary school-age children played touch football in the front yard of his family's home on Tuesday.

Six-year-old Jack was a huge Giants fan and Cruz his favorite player. 

Many wore Giants jerseys or Newtown football or wrestling shirts as they laughed, smiled and hugged.

The children and their families left after several hours. Young fans carried autographed Giants footballs and jerseys.

About 45 minutes later, Cruz left the home in an SUV and an escort of five police cruisers, sirens blaring.

He later tweeted that he has 'much love to the entire Pinto family. Great people with huge hearts'.

Several people leaving the home confirmed Cruz was there.

When the New York Giants took on the Atlanta Falcons this past Sunday, Cruz's boots were inscribed with the words 'Jack Pinto, My Hero', 'R.I.P. Jack Pinto' and 'This one is for you'.

Cruz later said: 'There's no words that can describe the type of feeling that you get when a kid idolizes you so much that unfortunately they want to put him in the casket with your jersey on.

'I can't even explain it.'
