England kick-off their Six Nations campaign against Wales at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on Friday night. Here is what Sir Clive Woodward believes England must do to win the Championship. 

1 GET IN THE FACE OF OPPONENTS

It’s been too cosy around the England squad for too long. Chris Robshaw and his side must be more confrontational.

2 LEAD FROM THE FRONT

This starts with Lancaster, he must stamp his authority on everything concerning England. The players will follow his lead. No compromise.

3 FEEL THE NEED FOR SPEED

England must pack their side with pace. It’s the only thing guaranteed to scare opponents. Selection against Wales is a very good start.

4 PILE ON THE PRESSURE

This England team need to have a ‘knockout rugby’ mindset that every game is their last. You only get one chance.

5 INCREASE THE NUMBER OFF OPPORTUNITIES

Players must know a gameplan to score from every position in the opposition third.

6 WIN UGLY IF NECESSARY

It’s all about winning and it doesn’t matter how you do it. Valiant losses count for little.

7 FORGET ABOUT TOMORROW

I’ve heard too much about the 2019 World Cup. The England team is not a development side.

Head coach Stuart Lancaster must concentrate on this Championship and not the World Cup in September

8 GIVE THE PLAYERS DIRECTION

This group of players is undoubtedly talented enough to win the World Cup. Can the coaches articulate their vision?

9 LOOK AFTER THE PLAYERS IN TRAINING

We all know our top players play too much rugby. They don’t need to be beasted in training. Intensity and focus are much more important.

10 ENJOY THE CHALLENGE

Being an England coach or player is the best job in the world and this will be a year unlike any other. But enjoyment comes in knowing everything is being done to become the best in the world.
