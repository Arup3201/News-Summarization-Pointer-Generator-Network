A leafy Surrey borough, dubbed the Beverly Hills of Britain, has been named as home to the highest income taxpayers in Britain for the second year running.

Sports stars and celebrities including Andy Murray and Sir Elton John are among the residents of Elmbridge, where HM Revenue and Customs collected more than £1.2billion in income tax in the 2011-12 tax year - more than a hundred times the £11.6million in corporation tax Google paid in 2012.

Those living in the district paid an average of £16,600 - a rise of more than 3 per cent on the previous year.

Residents in the area of Elmbridge, one of the 28 so-called 'stockbroker belt' areas in the top 30, paid an average of £16,600 - a rise of more than 3 per cent on the previous year

It is the second year in a row the district of Elmbridge has topped the table for those paying the highest average income tax bills.

It is one of 28 'stockbroker belt ' towns in the South East that make up the vast majority of the top 30 areas with the highest income tax payers, according to accountancy firm UHY Hacker Young.

Mark Giddens, head of private client services at UHY Hacker Young said: 'The Government is increasingly reliant on the wealthiest parts of the South Eastern commuter belt and London for income.

'The Government has gradually increased the tax burden on high earners since the credit crunch.

'Higher taxation of wealthy 
individuals in the South East has proven to be an effective means to 
boost tax receipts, but these numbers will not make for pleasant reading
 for those affected.'

Residents in Blackpool pay the lowest 
amount of income tax in the UK, with payments of £2,290 a year - a 
decrease of 4.6 per cent from £2,400 a year ago.

Last year residents in Elmbridge were reported to have paid a total of £1.18billion - which was twice the amount drawn from Cardiff and Newcastle combined.

Elmbridge's famous residents moved along the Thames to get away from the capital, and live in and around its principal towns of Esher, Walton on Thames and Weybridge.

In January it was reported Chelsea defender John Terry received £21.25million after selling his two neighbouring houses in Surrey.
