UKIP could form a tactical alliance with the Tories or Labour if the party wins a string of seats at the next election.

Nigel Farage signalled the possibility of a new ‘confidence and supply’ policy instead of a coalition deal.

Under such an agreement, his party would back key measures such as the Budget, but would not hold ministerial posts. Asked yesterday whether he would join a coalition, the Ukip leader said there were ‘other ways’ of doing it.

Nigel Farage has signalled that his party could back a 'confidence and supply' arrangement in the event of a hung parliament next year- agreeing to back key policies but voting freely on everything else

‘I don’t honestly think that has to be done just because the Liberal Democrats did that,’ he added.

‘There are other ways you can support a minority government in motions of confidence or supporting some of the key bills. There are ways of doing it.

‘Do I think we’ve got momentum behind us? Do I think we are picking up support across the board and do I think there’s a possibility that in May we will find ourselves in a position of a hung parliament where we have serious influence on the House of Commons? Well, yes, that’s a possibility’.

Mr Farage was given tacit support from Douglas Carswell, who will sit in the Commons as the sole Ukip MP from Monday.

Douglas Carswell has distanced himself from Nigel Farage’s (pictured) controversial remarks about foreigners – insisting he has ‘no difficulty with Britain as it is today’.

In his victory speech, Mr Carswell declined to endorse some of his leader’s views and revealed he had sought assurances that the party was not racist.

Mr Farage told his party’s spring conference this year that parts of Britain were like a foreign land and claimed he felt uncomfortable when he heard only foreign accents on the train.

The comments plunged him into his biggest political storm.

After holding his Clacton seat by a landslide, Mr Carswell urged his colleagues to show ‘compassion as well as passion’ and to be welcoming to first and second-generation migrants.

Mr Carswell, who supports securing Britain’s borders from illegal migrants, but believes that immigration is beneficial, tried to claim Mr Farage had been misunderstood.

As to whether he agreed with his view, Mr Carswell said: ‘I have no difficulty with Britain as Britain is today.’

But he admitted Ukip’s views on race were his biggest concern about joining. ‘I would never have joined a racist party’, he said.

Mr Carswell’s advice for his new party was: ‘Humility when we win. Modesty when we are proved right. If we speak with passion let it be tempered with compassion.’

He added: ‘Let us be a party for all Britain – and all Britons, first and second generation as much as any other.’

And he insisted he and Mr Farage saw eye to eye on most issues. ‘Sometimes, the things that people say in politics … are misrepresented in a way that doesn’t actually reflect what was meant.’

The newly elected MP for Clacton said he expected to back a Bill to recall errant members – one of his pet projects – when it is presented by Tory MP Zac Goldsmith.

Mr Carswell said he may support George Osborne’s Budget next April if it contained sensible measures to build on the economic recovery. 

But he said he would also back ‘good ideas’ from Labour and the Lib Dems, adding: ‘I can’t afford to be tribal now.’

Mr Farage downplayed remarks he made in a magazine interview claiming he would like to be Minister for Europe in a future coalition, saying ‘I don’t think they would have me.’

But a confidence and supply deal is becoming a real possibility because the polls indicate that neither Labour nor the Conservatives will win a majority next May and the largest party may choose to govern alone. 

Ukip feels it has little to gain from coalition when it can criticise both parties from the sidelines. Many Conservatives also reject the idea, saying voters would see it as a ‘stitch-up’.

Confidence and supply deals are struck when the largest party does not win the 326 seats required for a majority in the House of Commons – or if it loses its majority because of defections or by-elections.

The arrangement effectively means backing the bigger party in no-confidence votes (‘confidence’) and allowing it to pass laws to raise money (‘supply’) for their policies.

But in reality Ukip would demand concessions – while still allowing their MPs to speak their minds rather than having to support the Government.

Such an agreement took place in the ‘Lib-Lab Pact’ of 1977, when James Callaghan’s Labour government took power with a majority of just three seats but then lost MPs to by-elections. 

He asked David Steel for 13 Liberal MPs to vote with the government in exchange for accepting their proposals. However, the deal lasted just 15 months.

Faced with the same situation in 2010, the Lib Dems instead opted for a full Coalition under which MPs hold ministerial posts.

Iain Duncan Smith, the Tory Work and Pensions Secretary, wrote yesterday: ‘[Voters] are clearly tired of the Westminster games played out, the perception that in Westminster politicians make deals to help themselves and not the public.

‘That’s why I don’t believe making an electoral pact with Ukip – as some in my party have called for – is right.

‘Another Westminster stitch-up is not the answer to an electorate that wants to make a choice.’

Peter Bone, the Eurosceptic Tory MP for Wellingborough, said yesterday’s by-election results in Essex and the northern seat of Heywood made the need for electoral pacts with Ukip all the more urgent. ‘We need to lock David Cameron and Nigel Farage up in a room together until they come up with a solution’, he said.

Newly elected MP Douglas Carswell (pictured with Mr Farage today) has said he may support George Osborne's budget next April, but is open to 'good' suggestions from Labour and the Lib Dems

‘One way would be Ukip candidates supporting MPs locally who want to leave Europe, whether that is Tories or Labour people, they could endorse them.

‘At the end of the day, if the Tories and Ukip had run together in both Clacton and Heywood on a centre-Right ticket they would have won.

‘And it would be enormously disappointing if Labour get in next year with 33 per cent of the vote because we have split the vote between us.’

He dismissed the idea that the Conservatives and Ukip no longer have similar policies.

‘They are for coming out of Europe, against mass immigration and the folly of wind farms – these are views shared by Conservatives across the country.’

The Tories, who may fall short of a majority but remain the largest party next year, have discussed confidence and supply with the Democratic Unionist Party – which has eight MPs – if it takes the Conservatives over the finishing line. 

One significant factor in Clacton was a recent savagely anti-Ukip column in The Times by the gay ex-Tory MP Matthew Parris – a brilliant writer who is very much on the liberal wing of the party.

Here, we publish an abridged version of an article that was considered so damaging to the Tory cause that Ukip reproduced it in its Clacton campaign literature. 

Now Nigel Farage’s supporters are offering to fund visits by Mr Parris to the party’s other target seats . . .

Don’t buy the too-easy media picture of a rancid or untended town, or of bitter people; but understand that Clacton-on-Sea is going nowhere. Its voters are going nowhere, it’s rather sad, and there’s nothing more to say.

This is Britain on crutches. This is tracksuit-and-trainers Britain, tattoo-parlour Britain, all-our-yesterdays Britain. So of course Ukip will do well in the by-election.

My aim, though, is not to deny Ukip its likelihood of victory. They make a good fit for Clacton. 

Somebody has to represent the static caravans and holiday villages, and the people and places that for no fault of their own are not getting where a 21st century Britain needs to be going. 

Matthew Parris' column was considered so harmful to Tory chances in Clacton that Ukip supporters are now offering to pay for visits by him to other target seats

Nor do I deny that we Conservatives, if we tried hard enough, could get some of these voters back.

There are many in a place like this who might be attracted again to the Tories by a noisy display of hostility towards immigration-and-Europe, political correctness and health-and-safety: hostility to a Britain that has forgotten the joys of Ken Dodd, meat pies, smoking in pubs and the Bee Gees.

No, my aim is to ask this: is that where the Conservative Party wants to be? Is it where the Tories need to be if they’re to gather momentum in this century, rather than slowly lose it? 

Or do we need to be with the Britain that has its career prospects ahead and not behind, that can admire immigrants and want them with us, that doesn’t want to spend its days buying scratchcards and its evenings smoking in pubs, that’s amazed at all the fuss about whether gays should marry, that travels in Europe and would hesitate to let those links go?

I am not arguing that we should be careless of the needs of struggling people and places such as Clacton. But I am arguing – if I am honest – that we should be careless of their opinions.

Some of the Tory Right want to ... invest our political future in the disappointed, the angry, the nostalgic and the fearful. 

This is not a crazy strategy, because the market in pessimism is easy to capture, and easier to hold on to than the market in optimism; there will always be millions of pessimists.

But the truth from which the Right hides is this: You cannot look like a party for the resentful and still appeal to the cheerful. If you want to win Cambridge you may have to let go of Clacton.

From the train leaving London for Clacton, you can see Canary Wharf, humming with a sense of the possible. You must turn your back on that if you want to go to Clacton. I don’t, and the Tories shouldn’t.
