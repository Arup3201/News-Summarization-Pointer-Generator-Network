The beloved children’s cartoon Madeline celebrates its 75th anniversary this year, and to commemorate the occasion, the New York Historical Society is staging a retrospective of the work of its creator Ludwig Bemelmans.

More than 100 of his pieces, including original drawings from the Madeline books, are displayed in Madeline in New York: The Art of Ludwig Bemelmans – which marks his first solo show in close to 50 years.

Madeline, a series of six books (the first edition of which was published in 1939), is beloved worldwide for its expression of sweet sentiments and strong will.

A classic: Ludwig Bemelmans's career is celebrated in a new exhibit at the New York Historical Society, where his drawings, including those from Madeline, are on display (pictured, 'Madeline at the Paris Flower Market', an oil on canvas from 1955)

Singular approach: In the Madeline series, the title protagonist is a schoolgirl in Paris, and is shown escorted by a religious headmaster (pictured, a dummy cover by Bemelmans for the title Madeline and the Bad Hat c. 1956, pen, ink, watercolor, and gouache)

Original works: the exhibit includes original paintings from the first Madeline, like this page showing the schoolgirls in mid-winter (dated, 1939, watercolor and gouache)

The Caldecott Honor-winning book follows the life of title protagonist Madeline – the small, singularly red-headed student enrolled in a Catholic boarding school in Paris – alongside her fellow classmates, schoolmaster Miss Clavel, and neighborhood friend Pepito.

The first book famously starts with an illustration depicting Madeline and her fellow students filing behind their schoolmaster, accompanied by the inimitable intro line: ‘In an old house in Paris that was covered in vines, lived twelve little girls in two straight lines ...’

The Madeline character, as Bemelmans dreamed her to be, wore an endearing school uniform of a yellow sailor hat and blue overcoat – standing out from the rest of her classmates not only because of her fiery hair, but also her feisty personality.

Though the stories are based in the French capital, Madeline fans may be surprised to hear that the series is a thoroughly New York phenomenon.

On the road: Madeline has since become a successful TV series as well as a feature film (pictured, a sketch from Madeline and the Gypsies, 1959)

New York roots: While Madeline is based in Paris, the story was written and drawn in New York (pictured, a scene from Madeline's Rescue, 1953)

Humble beginnings: Ludwig Bemelmans wrote the manuscript for Madeline on the backside of a menu at Manhattan's Pete's Tavern (pictured, a drawing from Madeline and the Bad Hat, c. 1956)

Bemelmans wrote the first book in a corner booth at the famous Pete’s Tavern just off of Gramercy Park in Manhattan – an establishment that currently holds the distinction of being the longest continuously-running bar in the U.S. He scrawled the title’s manuscript on the backside of a bar menu.

Though Bemelmans considered himself more of an illustrator and artist than a writer, he did have unique prophecies when it came to catering to his literary audience.

He thought that children’s books should possess a certain degree of intelligence and was once quoted as saying: ‘We are writing for children, but not for idiots.’

The Austria-Hungary native, born in 1898, actually became a U.S. citizen in 1918 and lived the majority of his adult life in New York – where he died at the age of 64 in 1962.

Visitors to the city’s famous Bemelmans bar – located inside the Carlyle Hotel on the Upper East Side – especially privy to the author’s affinity for New York.

Defining points: While Madeline and her schoolmates all dressed the same, the title character stood out for her fiery hair and feisty spirit

Fearless: Madeline held a fearless spirit, and would help save her friends from trouble (pictured, a drawing from Madeline and the Bad Hat, c. 1956)

The bar is blanketed in Bemelmans sketches (Madeline included) – from the wallpaper to the tiny lamps adorning each cocktail table (two of which are on display at the NYHS) – because of an exchange the illustrator bartered in return for a year and a half worth’s free stay in the historic hotel.

Carlyle associates were so pleased with Bemelmans work that they also named the bar after him.

Bemelmans enjoyed success as a privately-commissioned illustrator - proof of which is also on display.

Among these relics are two remarkable panels that Bemelmans created for the walls of a playroom inside Aristotle Onassis’s yacht The Christina (commissioned in 1953).

Additional works also on display include the many cartoons that Bemelmans created for magazines including Town & Country, Harper’s Bazaar, and The New Yorker.

Madeline in New York: The Art of Ludwig Bemelmans will be on display at the New York Historical Society through October 19.
