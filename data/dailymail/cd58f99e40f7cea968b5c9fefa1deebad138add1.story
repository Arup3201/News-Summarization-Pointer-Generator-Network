Liverpool are ready to revive interest in Swansea pair Ben Davies and Wilfried Bony as their proposed moves to Tottenham stall.

Swansea are seemingly preparing for Bony's departure after they made an offer of around £6million for Watford striker Troy Deeney on Wednesday.

Tottenham's offer of Gylfi Sigurdsson for Davies and Michel Vorm was rejected but they have considered £20m-rated Bony, as well as Lille's Divock Origi.

Belgium striker Origi was at Liverpool's Melwood training ground though on Wednesday to hold initial talks over a £10m move.

He was pictured arriving at Melwood ahead of talks with the Liverpool hierarchy and manager Brendan Rodgers.

Liverpool also expect Benfica's Lazar Markovic to have a medical on Thursday ahead of finalising his £19.8m transfer.
