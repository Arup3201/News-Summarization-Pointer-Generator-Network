Mohamed Amin has been charged with four counts of preparing to enter a foreign state to engage in hostile activities

A New Zealand man accused of preparing to fight in Syria's civil war told authorities he was travelling to meet his fiancee, whose name he didn't know.

Mohamed Amin, 24, obtained a new passport and also got a phone in the 'unbeliever' name of Chris Wright as part of attempting to join the effort to remove president Bashar al-Assad, the Melbourne Magistrates Court was told on Thursday.

Amin booked a flight to Turkey and made plans to travel from there to Syria in September 2013, prosecutor Mark Gibson told the contested committal hearing.

But Amin was unable to leave Australia after authorities cancelled his passport.

In a text message Amin sent to someone after he was intercepted by federal police at Brisbane Airport, he wrote: 'She's not happy. She reckons I'm going to end up blowing myself up.'

Amin, who is being detained at Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre, is charged with four counts of preparing to enter a foreign state to engage in hostile activities.

Police monitored calls between Amin and Sydney man Hamdi Alqudsi, who allegedly sent Australians to Syria to fight in the civil war. He is charged but yet to face committal hearing.

Alqudsi told Amin there was a big operation coming up involving '1500 brothers', Mr Gibson said.

Police allege the 24-year-old, who appeared at Melbourne Magistrates Court on Thursday, was on his way to Syria via Turkey 

Alqudsi also told Amin of the urgent need to get to the front line and spoke of obtaining martyrdom, Mr Gibson said.

Amin said he and other 'doctors' were 'definitely' mentally ready for 'surgery', which prosecutors allege is code for individuals preparing to go to Syria.

Alqudsi also speaks of the 'boys' who've gone to fight in the battlefield.

'They will never come back until victory or martyrdom,' he said.

During the monitored conversations, Alqudsi tells Amin the most important thing is secrecy and no one was allowed to know anything.

Amin's passport has been cancelled and he is being detained at Maribyrnong Immigration Detention Centre (pictured) until his next hearing on December 18

On September 13, 2013, Amin tells Alqudsi everything is ready before he flew to Sydney, then Brisbane where he was bound for Turkey via Singapore.

But he was refused processing at customs in Brisbane as his New Zealand passport was cancelled.

He told the New Zealand Security Intelligence Service he recently got engaged to a girl in Denmark and was flying overseas to meet her, via Turkey, but he was unsure of her name.

Amin, a courier company worker formerly of Villawood, was living in Australia on a temporary visa.

The hearing resumes on December 18.
