Tied together with a pale pink ribbon dozens of World War II-era love letters from a New Jersey woman to her fiance have washed ashore in New York after Hurricane Sandy’s destruction.

Nearly hidden amid storm debris along an Atlantic Highlights beach, one day after Sandy, a 14-year-old boy discovered the box containing 57 letters in faded blues, purples and pink envelopes.

'I don't feel like sleeping so I thought I'd write you a few lines,' Katheleen Chaney whose son found the letters read to WNBC-TV.

Love story: A stack of 57 love letters dating back to WWII is seen after washing ashore following Hurricane Sandy

Long distance: The letters chronicled the long-distance relationship between a New Jersey woman and her fiance who was in Vermont

They chronicled the life of Dorothy Fallon and Lynn Farnham from 1942 until the week before they married in 1948.

'Well Darling, two weeks from today and we will be married,' she read the start of another.

Mr Farnham, a Vermont native served in the Pacific during the war placing some distance between the couple as she wrote from an address in New Jersey.

Ms Chaney tells WNBC-TV she started playing amateur detective as her son dried the letters by their fireplace, their only source of heat in their home after the storm.

Saved: Tied together with this pale pink ribbon the letters were protected by a box before dried by the fire by its finder, a 14-year-old boy

Their story: Written by Dorothy Fallon from 1942 until 1948, the young woman seen seated professed her love and excitement for her upcoming marriage to Lynn Farnham

Distance: Lynn Farnham, left, had served in the Pacific during the war placing some distance between him and Ms Fallon before their wedding in 1948

Mystery: What's not known is how the letters were released into the storm, with family of the couple saying they know of no one in the area

'I wanted to return them to whomever they belonged to,' Ms Chaney said. 'They're beautiful. She obviously adored him.'

Her first success came after finding Mr Farnham’s name on website FindaGrave.com. It wasn’t an immediate answer, tragically discovering that he had died in 1991, but a message on the page reaching out to his surviving family led her to a niece.

Writing Ms Chaney back, the niece said 91-year-old Dorothy Fallon Farnham was still alive as Mr Farnham's widower, however in frail health in Asbury Park.

Careful eye: Kathleen Chaney's son, seen carrying the letters along the shore, made the remarkable discovery one day after Hurricane Sandy made landfall

Preservation: Ms Chaney shows off a picture of her son carefully drying the letters by their home fireplace, serving as their own heat source in the storm's aftermath

Manhunt: So moved by the letters Ms Chaney, pictured, said she had to try her best to find the letters' owner, leading her to a niece of the couple in Virginia

‘She told me how wonderful her aunt was and her uncle and how absolutely in love they were,' she said of their first conversation which she said moved them both to tears.

It's believed the letters floated from the Rumson area, down a river and into Sandy Hook Bay.

What mystery still remains is who had been holding them before their release into the storm, with no known relatives said to be living in the area.

Despite an offer from someone to purchase the letters from her, she said she plans to mail them back to Mrs Farnham’s family.

'I love you dear and miss you very much,' Ms Chaney read in one letter's closing, a similar ending she said to all of them. 'All my love always, Dottie.'
