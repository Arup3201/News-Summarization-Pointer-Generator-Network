Almost 11,000 foreign prisoners are locked up in British jails, costing the taxpayer more than £430million per year.

This means around one in eight of the prison population are from another country, with overseas inmates accounting for 10,861 of the 86,048 total.

The Ministry of Justice estimates it costs £40,000 per year to keep a prisoner, which means the bill for foreigners is at least £434m.

The number of overseas prisoners in British institutions has soared over the past 15 years, with just 4,259 locked up here in 1996 - 7.8 per cent of the prison population, as opposed to 13 per cent now.

Jamaica, Poland and the Irish Republic are the countries with the most nationals in prison, according to MoJ statistics.

The number of foreign prisoners is probably even higher, since another 1,929 are classified as 'nationality not recorded'.

In May it emerged that more than 100 foreign criminals who the Government wants to deport are being released on to Britain’s streets every month to protect their ‘human rights’.

In total, there were 3,900 overseas convicts on bail in the community, free to commit new offences.

Once they have served their sentence, convicts can continue to be held only if there is a good chance of them being deported imminently.

Otherwise, they are free to use the Human Rights Act to say they have a right to a family life in the UK - and the courts have to let them go, pending lengthy appeals.

Tory MP Priti Patel, who questioned the figures in Parliament, said: 'Too many foreign nationals are enjoying themselves at taxpayers' expense in our jails.

'Foreign criminals flouting laws in Britain should be deported and ministers must get on with removing these dangerous people from our country.'

A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: 'It is Government policy to extend or negotiate compulsory prisoner transfer agreements with other countries.

'We have voluntary prisoner transfer agreements with more than 100 countries, allowing prisoners to serve their sentences in their home countries.

'An agreement which means that prisoners from certain European countries can be sent home to serve their sentences without their consent has recently come into force. We are taking steps to begin the implementation of this agreement in practice.

'We are in discussions with a number of countries to try to extend these arrangements.'
