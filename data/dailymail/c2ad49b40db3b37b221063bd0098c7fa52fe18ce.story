From beautifully detailed lions to terrifying zombies and even an elderly man, it seems there's little that make-up artist Belinda Maines cannot turn herself into.

Indeed, so impressive is the 21-year-old's portfolio, she has amassed more than 6,000 fans on Instagram and has piqued the interest of the team behind BBC show, Doctor Who.

What's more, Miss Maines, who hails from Newcastle, uses nothing more than cheap £1 face paints and discarded eye-shadows to create the looks.

'I just started doing this in my bedroom at night,' explains Miss Maines who spends her days doing make-up of the more conventional kind.

'I've had no training, it was just something that I enjoyed doing. It's a fairly cheap hobby. I buy face paints from fancy dress shops and they only work out at £1 each.

'As well as that I use things I find around the house, CDs that I cut up, beads from necklaces, pots of glitter and old eye-shadows.'

The designs, all of which are Miss Maines' own work, take days to plan and up to three hours to complete.

But once she has finished photographing the incredibly intricate looks, she washes them off and is never seen wearing the designs in public.

'It's a horrible feeling to see all that work go literally down the drain, but once I've taken a picture there is no reason to keep it on,' she explained.

'A few times my neighbours have caught sight of me in the garden trying to get good lighting for a photograph. They stand staring with their mouths open.

'Once a man even got the rest of his family to have a look but I always get positive reactions online though.'

Now Miss Maines' hard work appears to be paying off after the special effects team behind long-running BBC series Doctor Who got in touch.

'They got in touch to say how much they liked my work,' she reveals. 'I would love to do make-up for one of a zombie movie - that would be incredible.'
