The FA have launched a probe into allegations that Blackburn striker Rudy Gestede was racially abused at Middlesbrough on Saturday.

Both clubs have been contacted and asked for their observations after referee Mark Clattenburg included the incident in his match report. Cleveland Police have received a complaint and are also understood to be investigating.

Gestede scored Blackburn’s injury-time equaliser in a 1-1 draw at the Riverside but reacted furiously to what is believed to have been a ‘monkey’ gesture made to him from the Middlesbrough section of fans at the final whistle.

He protested to Clattenburg and was joined by Markus Olsson and Lee Williamson, Blackburn’s stand-in captain who then went to see the referee after the match.

The FA opened an investigation after receiving Clattenburg’s report on Monday and are working with both clubs to try and identify any culprits.

Clattenburg himself was accused of racially abusing Chelsea midfielder John Obi Mikel in a game against Manchester United two years ago. 

The 39-year-old was later cleared of any wrongdoing while Mikel was hit with a three-match ban and £60,000 fine for threats made to the referee after the game at Stamford Bridge.
