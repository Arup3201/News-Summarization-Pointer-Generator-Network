Two leaders of the English Defence League are to stand trial next month for obstructing police officers while trying to march to the scene of the murder of Lee Rigby.

Tommy Robinson, 30, the leader of the far-right group, allegedly wanted to defy a police ban by marching past a mosque to Woolwich Barracks in southeast London.

The EDL supremo - real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon - and his deputy Kevin Carroll, 44, were arrested when they tried to enter the borough of Tower Hamlets on June 29. 

Charged: English Defence League leaders Kevin Carroll, left, and Tommy Robinson are accused of obstructing police by trying to defy a ban on marching to the scene of Fusilier Lee Rigby's murder via the East London Mosque on June 29

Denial: Both men, who appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court today, denied a single charge of obstructing a police officer at the march

Upcoming trial: Tommy Robinson - real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon - and Deputy Leader Kevin Carroll, right, will go on trial next month

The pair are accused of deviating from a specific route laid down by the police which prevented them from entering the borough.

Robinson and Carroll appeared together in the dock today at Westminster Magistrates Court.

Carroll entered a not guilty plea to the single charge of obstructing a police officer, while Robinson had denied the charge at an earlier hearing.

The two men claim they were on a charity walk that day, culminating with the laying of flowers in Woolwich where Drummer Rigby was killed.

Not a protest: Both Kevin Carroll, left, and Tommy Robinson argue they were on a charity walk that day which would end in laying flowers at the scene of Lee Rigby's murder

Deviation: The EDL leaders are accused of deviating from a specific route laid down police during the march to the scene of Lee Rigby's death

Fixed date: The two men were released on bail until the half-day court trial in October

In the current case against Robinson and Carroll, the prosecution rests on video footage which is said to show the pair asking if they will be arrested if they pass Aldgate East Tube Station.

They argue they were on a sponsored walk to Woolwich Barracks where they were planning to lay flowers in memory of Drummer Rigby.

The Met Police say they had offered two alternative routes for the walk which avoided Tower Hamlets, home to the East London Mosque, and had warned that anyone who tried to march to Woolwich would face arrest.

Judge Elizabeth Roscoe freed the pair on bail to appear at the same court for a half-day trial on October 16.

She told them: ‘Bail will be unconditional, you have heard what I have to say about that.

‘But it doesn’t mean you are immune from sanction.’

Robinson and Carroll, both from Luton, deny obstructing a police officer.
