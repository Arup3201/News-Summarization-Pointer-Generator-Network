An inquest has begun into the death of a 28-year-old Perth woman who died 24 hours after seeing a doctor for shortness of breath.

Croatian born Petra Zele died from a blood clot in her lungs in May of 2010, only five months after she married her partner.

The professional dancer, who also worked as a sustainability officer in the western suburb of Cottesloe, died despite various test results showing abnormalities, the ABC reports.

Croatian born Petra Zele died from a blood clot in her lungs in May of 2010. She had visited a hospital two weeks before her death and a family doctor the day before, but was not told of her abnormal test results

The inquest into the facts and circumstances surrounding Mrs Zele's death was launched by her mother, Jackie Zele, who was concerned about how her daughter was treated.

A fortnight before her death, Mrs Zele had visited Fremantle Hospital after experiencing chest pain, according to the West Australian.

Doctors diagnosed her with musculoskeletal pain before sending her home with pain killers, but the results from an electrocardiogram had recorded abnormalities. 

Within 24 hours, Mrs Zele had collapsed en route to the hospital. She died shortly afterwards. 

She then visited her family doctor with shortness of breath, but was again sent home despite another test concluding that she had severe pulmonary hypertension – a result which she was never informed of.

The professional dancer, who also worked as a sustainability officer in Cottesloe, died only five months after marrying her partner 

Within 24 hours, Mrs Zele, had collapsed on her way to hospital. She died shortly afterwards.

On the first day of the coronial inquiry, a letter from Mrs Zele's mother was read out which paid tribute to 'a beautiful soul' who had only just married the love of her life.

'She was always the life of the party, so full of life and high on life itself,' the letter said.

'She was a beautiful soul, and her beauty touched everyone she met. We believe her tragic death was preventable.' 

The inquest into Mrs Zele's death will run until November 28 and will examine whether the actions of the medical staff involved were appropriate.
