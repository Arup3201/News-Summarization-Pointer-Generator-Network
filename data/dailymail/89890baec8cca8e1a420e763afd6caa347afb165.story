Mark Clattenburg makes headlines on and off the field and this week is no different.

However, following a tough match at Goodison Park, it was Ross Barkley and James Tomkins who should be highlighted after poor conduct during Everton's clash with West Ham on Saturday.

Disappointingly, Barkley fooled Clattenburg with a clear dive when the Everton man  went down without contact from West Ham’s Kevin Nolan; the blame for this must lie with Barkley but Clattenburg will be cross with himself for being conned.

Everton’s opening goal was clearly offside as Romelu Lukaku was in an offside position before Barkley’s shot was deflected to him. of course assistant referees are the judges of offside so again the Geordie referee should escape blame.

The melee which followed after Clattenburg awarded a free kick for James McCarthy’s very strong challenge on Morgan Amalfitano seemed to be down to the referee’s uncharacteristic casual approach to the incident. 

It was clear that West Ham’s players were angry at the tackle and looked to get back at McCarthy. Usually, Clattenburg would have diffused the situation but instead allowed players to confront one another. One could argue whether a red card could have been shown but replays showed both players going in with raised boots and so a yellow card for each player looked appropriate.

Fifteen minutes into a spiky second half, Clattenburg’s ‘laissez faire’ approach allowed the heat to rise again by failing to award Kevin Mirallas a free kick. The angry Everton man then chased back and chopped Amalfitano down – a clear caution.  

Before Clattenburg could issue a card,  Tomkins pushed Mirallas who responded by shoving him back.

Both players clearly pushed each other in the chest but embarrassingly Tomkins went down holding his face, simulating where contact had occurred. Both men were fortunate to escape with yellow cards.

At least Clattenburg ended the game with some credit as an excellent advantage led to the home team’s winning goal but this will not be a performance which he will list as one of his finest.
