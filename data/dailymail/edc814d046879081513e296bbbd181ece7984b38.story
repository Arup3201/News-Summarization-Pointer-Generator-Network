A global hunt has been launched for a mystery good Samaritan who returned a four-carat diamond ring to its owner on Valentine's Day after she lost it at an airport and boarded a flight to London.

Navneet Guleria, 52, from Pennington, New Jersey, was passing through security at Newark Airport when she dropped the ring - a 25th wedding anniversary gift from her husband.

By the time she realised the band was gone, it was too late and she and her husband were already taxiing the runway.

But she has now been reunited with her precious after an unknown woman found it and handed it in to Transportation Security Administration Officer Meredith Grillos.

'Every time I go through the checkpoint i take m jewellery off,' she told Pix11 News. 'I dropped it and never noticed. So when I got on the plane I looked for my ring and it wasn't there. I just panicked and started shouting at my husband to do something, go and talk to someone.'

But it was too late. Cabin crew told the couple the plane was about to fly and could not be turned around.

'God bless America': avneet said, 'I didn't think anybody would do this ... I was so happy. What a great country we live in. God bless America'

'I was devastated but when we got to London, my husband got on the phone and called the TSA and filed a claim,' she said.

When they returned home a week later, Navneet, who was born in New Delhi, India, called the TSA to see if there was any progress.

'They said, "we may have it and we will call you back in 15 minutes. She rang back and asked, 'what does the band look like? I said it was a thick band and she said, "okay, we have it."'

And now aviation advocacy group The Global Gateway Alliance want to track the good Samaritan down to offer her a free flight for her good deed.

'While all of us wait in long lines, struggle with security protocols and hear horror stories of thefts by airport workers, itâ€™s important to know that our fellow travelers have our backs and TSA agents work hard for passengers,' Alliance Chairman Joseph Sitt told the New York Post.

'I didn't think anybody would do this ... I was so happy,' Navneet added. 'What a great country we live in. God bless America.'

Anybody who might know the mystery good Samaritan are urged to email ring@globalgatewayalliance.org and include proof of travel date and time.
