When it comes to incentivising weight loss and encouraging a healthy population, one apartment building in Asia thinks it has the answer.

The Lady Share House B&D, an all-female residential facility in Osaka, Japan, have established a tenancy agreement whereby rent is set based on a person's fluctuating weight: the more weight you lose, the less rent you pay. And the reverse applies, too.

Landlords now deduct 1,000 yen (£6.50) from rent for every 2.2lbs lost at the building's regular three-month weigh-ins... or add the same amount if the weight has been gained.

This development comes in spite of 30 per cent of women in their twenties in Japan being underweight.

Base rent at the Lady Share House B&D is determined by multiplying the renter's weight in kilograms by 1,000 yen, in addition to a 38,000 yen floor price, according to the Japanese news website Otaku Kokka.

The building has also opened an exercise studio equipped fitness equipments in order to help renters control and lose their weight. They also offer discounted beauty products, snacks and free lectures on weight management.

Mari Kataoka, the enterprise administrator, told Associated Press the original goal was to create a supportive environment for overweight women looking to lose weight, but has attracted women with 'normal' body shapes who wish to be incentivised to stay in shape, according to the Huffington Post.

'Since the rent is lower if you lose weight, we thought overweight people would be coming to live here. Instead, we found that people who already have a great body come here and their goal is to maintain that physique,' she said.

Speaking of why the two-dozen tenants are provided with unlimited snacks and sugary soft drinks, Ms Kataoka said it was not a scam to increase rents.

She said: 'By having snacks at their disposal, we hope they will become more resistant to temptation. In this share house the residents have the same goals to lose weight, so it's easier not to give up.'
