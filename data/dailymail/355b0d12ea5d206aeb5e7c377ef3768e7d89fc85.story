This is the terrifying moment a balaclava-clad thief stormed into a betting shop and threatened staff with a two-foot long samurai-style sword.

Workers at the Coral betting store in Burnley were left petrified after the robber burst into the shop and demanded they hand over cash.

During the alarming incident, he approached the counter and yelled at staff to hand over money before smashing a computer screen with his weapon.

The suspect wielded a two-foot long sword at workers while demanding they hand over cash. There were two staff members working at the time of the incident, one behind the counter and one in the shop (top right)

The suspect took between £150 and £200 from the till in the shop before workers managed to contact police

It is understood he also jumped over the counter area while threatening two members of staff with the weapon before stealing between £150 and £200 from the till.

He then made off towards the city centre while shocked workers called police. 

Officers have now released CCTV footage of the incident, which occurred at 8.45pm on July 21, in an attempt to trace the suspect.

DC Dave Greenwood, of Pennine CID, is urging anyone with information about the ‘violent and aggressive attack’ to come forward.

He said: ‘I would like people to take a close look at these CCTV images.

‘If anyone knows who this man may be, please get in touch with us as soon as you can.
