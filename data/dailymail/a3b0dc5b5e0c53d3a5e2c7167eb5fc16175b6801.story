Oscar Pistorius' girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, admitted to being scared of the South African track star in a text message sent less than three weeks before he shot her dead, a police expert told his murder trial today.

Pistorius was in tears as the messages were read aloud in the Pretoria court - one of them from the model to the athlete read: 'I'm scared of you sometimes and how you snap at me,' while a later text read 'I can’t be attacked by outsider for dating u and be attacked by you the person I deserve protection from.'

The couple argued about what she alleged was the athlete's short temper and jealousy, police Capt. Francois Moller testified, citing text messages he extracted from cell phones.

One of the model's messages sent using WhatsApp read: 'I'm scared of you sometimes and how you snap at me'

Moller says that about 90 percent of the messages he downloaded were what he called normal and 'loving' exchanges.

But there were exceptions that he printed out for the court in Pistorius' murder trial.

The Olympic and Paralympic athlete is on trial for the murder of 29-year-old model and law graduate Steenkamp on Valentine's Day 2013.

He has pleaded not guilty to murder, saying he was deeply in love with Steenkamp, whom he had been dating for a few months, and that he mistook for an intruder hiding in a toilet at his luxury Pretoria home.

A message sent by Steenkamp read: 'We
 are living in a double standard relationship. Every five seconds I hear
 about how you dated another chick. You really have dated a lot of 
people yet you get upset if I mention one funny story with a long term 
boyfriend.'

Oscar Pistorius takes his seat in court today. A neighbour testified that she heard gunshots, screaming and then a
 second set of gun shots on the night that the double-amputee runner 
fatally shot his girlfriend

Pistorius calls his girlfriend 'Angel' and she called him 'Baba.'

In one message exchange the pair appear to be arguing over an incident at a friend's engagement party.

Steenkamp wrote: 'I regard myself as a lady and I didn't feel like one tonight after the way u treated me when we left.  I am trying my best to make u happy and I feel as tho u sometimes never are no matter the effort I put in. I can’t be attacked by outsider for dating u and be attacked by you the person I deserve protection from.'

Pistorius wrote in a message: 'I want to talk to you. I want to sort this out. I don’t want to have anything less than amazing for you and I’m sorry for the things I saw without thinking and for taking offense to some of your actions.’

He said that his illness and sickness was not ‘an excuse.’

‘I was upset you that you just left me after we got food to go talk to a guy and I was standing right behind you watching you touch his arm and ignore me and when I spoke up you introduced me which you could’ve done but when I left you just kept on chatting to him when clearly I was upset.'

In another message, Pistorius told Steenkamp that his friends will take the blame for a shooting incident that occurred a month before Steenkamp was killed.

Earlier today a
 neighbour of Pistorius testified that she heard gunshots, screaming and
 then a second set of gun shots on the night that the runner fatally 
shot Steenkamp.

Anette 
Stipp's testimony matched some of the evidence given by other witnesses 
earlier in the trial who said they also heard a woman screaming around 
the time that Pistorius killed Steenkamp before dawn on February 14, 
2013.

The defence has 
countered that the neighbors were actually hearing Pistorius screaming 
in a high-pitched voice after he shot Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model.

Pistorius has said he shot his 
girlfriend by mistake through a locked toilet door, thinking that she 
was an intruder in his home.

Chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel opened Monday's court session by noting evidence will include analysis of cellular telephones, including two that were removed from the bathroom where the shooting happened

Stipp,
 the neighbor, said under questioning from Nel that she heard gunshots 
while lying awake around 3 a.m. on the night of the shooting, and then 
heard the 'terrified, terrified' screams of a woman.

Her
 bedroom is situated across a grassy area about 70 metres (230 feet) 
from Pistorius' home, and the windows of the athlete's bathroom are 
visible from her window.

'The
 screaming at that stage just continued,' said Stipp, who recalled 
looking out from a balcony at two houses with lights on in the gated 
estate where her family and Pistorius lived.

Defence lawyer Barry Roux has said that after Pistorius fired into the door that he battered the door with a cricket bat to try to get to Steenkamp after realising she was inside the toilet cubicle

She
 said she told her husband Johan, who previously testified, that the 
screaming sounded as though a 'family murder' had taken place.

'There
 was definitely a female screaming for quite a period,' Anette Stipp 
said. 'You could definitely hear two different voices.'

She said she then heard a second set of shots, and the screaming stopped.

The defence has said that Pistorius fired into the door and then battered the door with a cricket bat to get to Steenkamp after realising she was inside the toilet cubicle.

It insists that some neighbors who testified mistook the sound of the cricket bat striking the door for gunshots.

Pistorius'
 camp also maintains that Pistorius fired with quick bursts that gave 
Steenkamp no time to scream, and so Pistorius did not realize he was 
shooting at Steenkamp.

A 
South African police ballistics expert, however, has testified that the 
first of three bullets that struck Steenkamp hit her in the right hip, 
giving her time to scream before she was hit in the arm and head.

Defence
 lawyer Kenneth Oldwadge pressed neighbor Anette Stipp on her 
recollections, questioning whether she was inside her house or on a 
balcony while hearing what she said were shots and screams, and whether 
she was alert because she had said she was slightly ill at the time.

He said she was wrong to say the light was in Pistorius' bathroom around the time of the shooting.

Stipp also testified about an incident this year in which she again heard screams in the estate at night.

The testimony appeared to refer to what Pistorius' defense lawyers have
 referred to as noise tests that they conducted to determine how sound 
carries and to prove their contention that the runner screams in a high 
voice when extremely anxious.

The sounds included a male voice screaming in both high and low pitches, Stipp said.

The
 screaming this year, she said, had 'very little emotion,' in contrast 
to the screaming she heard on the night of Steenkamp's death.

Nel,
 the prosecutor, has said he will wrap up his case against Pistorius 
this week after calling four or five more witnesses to support his 
contention that the Olympian intentionally killed Steenkamp after an 
argument.

The defence will then present its case.

Judicial officials say the trial will continue until May 16, with a recess in April.
