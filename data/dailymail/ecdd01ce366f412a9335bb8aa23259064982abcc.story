Liza Minnelli was originally due to star in the Pine Brothers Softish Throat Drops commercial that aired during the Golden Globes featuring Martha Stewart - but the Cabaret star canceled on the day of the shoot after making a host of diva demands and suffering an apparent ‘nervous breakdown’ according to brand’s boss.

The 67-year-old star, and daughter of Judy Garland, was all set to film the throat lozenges commercial back in September, but unexpectedly cancelled at the last minute claiming it was ‘too much pressure’.

Liza’s decision to cancel was all the more frustrating for the ad makers as they’d bent over backwards to accommodate her lengthy list of demands which reportedly included a $400 coffee service, black Egyptian cotton towels and two cartons of cigarettes, plus a team to do her make-up and hair at the Waldorf Towers in New York City.

‘Producers begged Liza to leave her apartment, which was only a few blocks away, and come to the shoot. She refused, saying this was 'too much pressure,' a source told the New York Post.

Pine Brothers boss Rider McDowell told Business Insider he turned to Martha ‘after our first actress had a nervous breakdown the morning of the shoot.’

The 72-year-old TV personality who rarely advertises products that don’t have her name attached was quick to step in and she on set within the hour.

‘Like a real pro. She was done in make-up within 10 minutes, and filmed the ad in 30. She probably earned $1 million in 40 minutes,’ said the source.

The old-fashioned soft-focus ad has been running since October on daytime TV, but a high profile spot during Sunday awards show on NBC has prompted renewed interest in it.

In the commercial, Martha walks into a room, introduces herself only by her first name and then starts to talk about the lozenge brand.

With no soundtrack and a very basic looking overlay of the product, the whole thing feels distinctly cheap.

It drew a flurry of criticism on social media on Sunday night with comments including that it looked like a ransom video and questioning if the entire budget had been spent on Martha.

‘While Liza had some initial conversations... they couldn’t agree on a script. So it didn’t get past that stage and all decided to part ways. Therefore [this] is a bit harsh. And untrue.

'While she may be showbiz royalty, she’s surprisingly easy. The most we ever ask to have on hand is a Coca-Cola. And if we’re being especially demanding, then some red Gatorade, too,’ said Scott Gorenstein.

A spokesperson for Pine Brothers said, ‘We prefer not to comment and remain big fans of Ms. Minnelli.’

Oscar-winner Minnelli, who has battled various addictions throughout her life, wasn't at Sunday's awards show but was in fine form just days before when she hosted a luncheon for Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto, the stars of Dallas Buyers Club.

‘Honey, if you don't win the Oscar, I'll give you mine!’ she told McConaughey.

Both actors won their respective categories at the Golden Globes on Sunday.
