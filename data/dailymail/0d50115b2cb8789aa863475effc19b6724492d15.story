Chilling footage has emerged of the moment a terrorist mercilessly gunned down a shopper in last month's bloody attack at a Kenyan shopping mall.

Surveillance video obtained exclusively by CNN from a supermarket in the Westgate shopping centre shows the moment terrified men, women and children ran for their lives from the attackers.

One man cowers in front of a cashier desk, but he is immediately spotted by one of the terrorists who shoots him at close-range and walks away.

Chilling: Surveillance footage has emerged of the moment a gunman shot down a shopper in the Kenyan mall attack last month

Sprawled out in a pool of blood on the shop floor, the man desperately tries to gather the strength to crawl away to safety.

He drags himself up to a sitting position, but falls back on to the tiled flooring.

The gunman soon returns and shows the terrified man no mercy, shooting him again.

In total at least 67 people died in the September siege - the chilling video clips obtained by the news outlet show just the first day of the bloody massacre.

Fear: Men, women and children run for their lives as the terrorists target the shop

In another surveillance video the British four-year-old who famously told one of the terrorists that he was a 'very bad man' can be seen with his mother and six-year-old sister.

His mother, a film producer, had been queuing to buy milk when the militants struck.

She hid under a cold meat counter in the
Nakumatt supermarket for an hour-and-a-half with her children beneath 
her before terrorists finally found them and shot her in the thigh.

Amazing courage: The boy with his sister,Â  stands holding a Mars bar given to him by a terrorist outside the Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi after being released

Hostile: A terrified teenage girl walks through the supermarket with her hands in the air. She is wearing a white top stained with blood and is being tailed by the gunman

The trio are shown walking through through the supermarket - the mother is pushing an injured child in a trolley.

They are followed by a terrified teenage girl wearing a white top stained with blood who is walking along with her hands up in the air.

Behind them a gunman, brandishing an assault rifle, gestures the way.

Bizarrely, the terrorists handed the children Mars bars before they fled. The woman, the children and girl were all eventually released.

Identity: The hostage takers in the video have not yet been identified by authorities

Outside knowledge: A terrorist uses a mobile phone as the bloody massacre continues. Authorities believe the group were receiving instructions from outside

Another clip shows the terrorists scouting out a supermarket while chatting on their mobile phones.

Al-Shabaab said it remained in contact with the attackers as they battled Kenyan forces during the hostage crisis.

At one point it looks as though one of the terrorists is looking for surveillance cameras.

CNN reports that the attackers appear relaxed in several clips - in one quiet period they are even seen taking turns for prayer time.

War against terror: The brazen attack by Islamic militants has underscored Kenya's value to the West in the war against terror

Hunt: Two attackers move their way through the mall car park

Horror: Terrified shoppers run in terror as the attackers stalk them through the mall

The brazen attack by Islamic militants has underscored Kenya's value to the West in the war against terror.

The Somali Islamic group al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the assault and said it was in retaliation for Kenya sending troops into neighboring Somalia.

The killers, who were dressed in Western clothes, ordered all Muslims to leave, before carrying out rudimentary tests to see if hostages could recite the Koran and name the mother of the Prophet Mohammed.

Witnesses told how terrorists with faces hidden by Islamic scarves stormed the building, tossing grenades and spraying shoppers with AK-47s.
