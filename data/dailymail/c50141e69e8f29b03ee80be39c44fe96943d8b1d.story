The children of a wealthy widow are in a legal battle with her former physiotherapist over the woman’s £30 million fortune.

The two adult children told a court how the female physiotherapist has possession of their frail mother’s jewellery including a ‘very valuable’ diamond ring and £5 million of her money.

They also feared she was planning to take their 81-year-old mother, who suffers from Parkinson’s disease and dementia, to Florida without their consent.

The children told the Court of Protection hearing that the physiotherapist helped herself to money and valuables

At a preliminary Court of Protection hearing, the children argued that the physiotherapist had helped herself to money and valuables from their mother and late father, who died in June this year, and ‘emotionally and physically abused’ the elderly couple.

District Judge Denzil Lush - who ruled no parties in the case could be identified - heard the physiotherapist was employed by the couple in 2000, and grew personally close to the husband, which led to a serious deterioration in his relationship with his children.

The children claimed that between 2009 and 2011, their father and the physiotherapist restricted contact with their mother.

When their father died in June 2014, they feared that the physiotherapist had ‘unfettered control of the household and could physically abuse their mother’.

The children’s barrister, Philip Jenkins, said: ‘There is a strong case of physical, emotional and financial abuse against their elderly and vulnerable parents.’

They also expressed concerns she was planning to take their mother to Florida (pictured), without their consent

At an earlier hearing in July, the children were granted a court injunction, forcing the physiotherapist to hand over their mother’s passport and not take her out of England.

The physiotherapist was also required to leave the widow’s home, and she later gave her up appointment as executor of the widow’s will, and flew to Florida.

At the second hearing, held to consider costs in the case, Mr Jenkins argued ‘it is not without significance that a substantial proportion’ of her 60th wedding anniversary jewellery purchased by her late husband in February 2014 was in the physiotherapist’s possession... plus a very valuable diamond ring’ belonging to their mother.

And they claimed she had received about £5 million of the family’s money since 2008.

Jordan Holland, representing the physiotherapist, said his client ‘does not accept’ the truth of the evidence against her, but if she gave detailed replies it would drive up the legal costs.

Mr Holland called for her £11,000 costs should be paid from the widow’s estate, which was worth £30 million.

She had complied with a wide ranging injunction backed by the threat of prison, he added, but that there was no real need for the order, as she had simply suggested to the children that their mother might like to go to Florida.

District Judge Lush ruled that the allegations against the physiotherapist were a matter for another court ‘in the context of any claim brought against her for the recovery for funds.’

He also lifted the earlier injunction.

Her conduct in the case, he said, had been satisfactory and he ordered all costs to be paid from the widow’s estate.

The judge also declaration that the widow’s decisions in her ‘living will’ were valid and applied to her treatment.
