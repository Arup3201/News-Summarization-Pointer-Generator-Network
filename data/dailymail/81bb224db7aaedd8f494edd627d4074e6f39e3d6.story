George Groves showed that he has become a better loser with a tweet poking fun at himself this morning.

Groves was knocked out by Carl Froch in the eighth round but this morning tweeted 'Haven't watched it back properly yet but I think... I got knocked the f*** out!'

The rematch was arranged after the pair's first bout was halted early in November. Groves did not react well to defeat and demanded a rematch.

Recovery: Groves was speaking to Sky Sports News this morning and thankfully he didn't look too bad

After this defeat the London boxer was much more calm and he and Froch were seen to embrace and Froch spent a lot of time talking to his opponent after the game.

The victory meant that Froch retained both his IBF and WBA super middleweight titles.

Froch has dismissed reports that he could be about to retire, instead hinting that he would like to fight in Las Vegas.
