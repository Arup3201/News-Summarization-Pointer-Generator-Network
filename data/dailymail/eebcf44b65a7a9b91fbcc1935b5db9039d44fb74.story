Of all the stories to emerge from the Costa Concordia cruise ship disaster, it's possibly the hardest to believe.

The human bridge created by British dancer James Thomas and the bizarre antics of captain Francesco Schettino pale in comparison to the claims of two Swiss brothers.

For they have revealed how the theme tune from the film Titanic was 
playing onboard as it struck rocks and started to keel 
over.

Eerie: Costa Concordia passengers say Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On, from the film Titanic starring Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, was playing in a restaurant as the ship went down

They said survivors of the disaster were 'astonished' by the eerie coincidence which saw them listening to Celine Dion's hit My Heart Will Go On as the cruise ship began to founder.

The song was made internationally famous in 1997 as the theme of James Cameron’s epic movie about the 1912 sinking of the Titanic, starring Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet.

The men said they were listening to My 
Heart Will Go On with passengers in a restaurant on board the ship when 
the accident happened.

Yannic Sgaga, who escaped from the Costa Concordia with his brother Keven, said: 'Images from the film Titanic are more realistic than one might imagine.'

Spooky: Two Swiss brothers have 'revealed' how the theme tune from the film Titanic was playing on the Costa Concordia (pictured) as it struck rocks and started to keel over

A survivor of the Costa Condordia cruise ship disaster is the grand-daughter of a woman who survived the Titanic tragedy 100 years earlier.

Valentina Capuano, 30, said she was 'dumbstruck' that history was repeating itself when the giant Italian ship began sinking on Friday night.

Her grandmother and great uncle had both been aboard the Titanic when it sank on its maiden voyage from Southampton to new York in 1912.

Her grandmother survived but her great uncle Giovanni - working as a waiter aboard the ship - was one of the 1,517 people who died.

Ms Capuano was travelling with her fiance, her brother and his girlfriend when the 140,000 tonne vessel struck rocks off the Italian island of Giglio.

She said: 'It was like re-living history, it was horrible, I was really shocked. I am still shaken up and get very upset when I think about what I've been through, I have heart palpitations.'

He said the tune was 'stuck in my head' as most crew members did absolutely nothing to help them.

He added: 'Besides kitchen staff, who helped, there were no other crew members.'

Georg Linsi, who is also Swiss, told the Geneva paper La Tribune: 'The evacuation was a catastrophe within a catastrophe.

'Never in my life have I seen such a display of incompetence, lack of awareness and irresponsibility.

'When the boat started to lean to the left, we held onto the right side. Besides one young sailor, there was not a single crew member near the life boats who was able to organise the evacuation.'

As the ship began to bank, he said 'hundreds of people were inside without information, with no indication of what to do.

'There was so much panic when the boat was so steeply inclined that we had to walk on the walls. We remained inside for three hours before managing to get out, and were able to leave the ship via a flexible ladder  and reached the a coast guard vessel.'

The Titanic sank in 1912 after hitting an iceberg on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York. A total of 1,517 people died.
