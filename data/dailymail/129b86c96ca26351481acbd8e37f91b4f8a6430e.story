It was the fire escape where Richard Gere declared his love, the diner where John Travolta shimmied back to stardom, and the New York city streets where Robert De Niro slowly went insane while driving his taxi.

These are the beloved settings for some of the cinema's most famous scenes. 

But what about when the cameras stop rolling - do these landmarks still resemble how they look on the screen?

The historic Golden Nugget casino, featured in the James Bond film 'Diamonds Are Forever' in 1971, underwent a $100 million renovation

And The Mint, a casino also seen in the film, was sold in 1988 and is now part of Binion's Horseshoe Casino

The images, captured by ScenePast, include side-by-side comparisons from 'Pretty Woman,' 'Pulp Fiction,' 'Taxi Driver,' 'Diamonds Are Forever,' 'Sunset Boulevard,' 'Back To The Future,' 'Fame,' 'It's A Wonderful Life,' 'Broadway Danny Rose,' 'Bullitt,' 'Naked City' and 'Serpico.' 

Some of the locations have remained almost identical despite the years that have passed.

The fire escape that Richard Gere's character climbed in 'Pretty Woman' to declare his love for Vivian, Julia Robert's prostitute with a heart of gold, remains intact at the Las Palmas Hotel  in Hollywood.

Quentin Tarantino's 1994 film Pulp Fiction transformed a Glendale, California, 44-lane bowling alley into Jack Rabbit Slim's. The location, famous for John Travolta and Uma Thurman's twist dance, has since been shuttered

The only difference is a new sign and a palm tree gracing the entrance. 

Although the stores next to New York's Carnegie Delicatessen featured in Woody Allen's 'Broadway Danny Rose' may have come and gone, the deli on 7th Ave is still standing strong. 

The police station in 1948 noir 'Naked City' is West 20th Street has also been preserved in the Big Apple, where it remains a NYPD precinct. 

The New York streets (pictured is 7th Ave and 43rd) have modernized to include a Walgreens and advertisements 

Schwab's Pharmacy, featured in 1950 classic Sunset Boulevard, was a real drug store where many movie actors and industry executives hung out. It was demolished in 1983 and a shopping complex featuring a Starbucks stands in its place

And fans hoping to see the McFly residence from Back To The Future will be happy to know little has changed at the Arleta, California home - except for a new basketball hoop. 

The Martini family's home from It's A Wonderful Life also remains unchanged in Los Angeles, 67 years after the Christmas classic was filmed.

The movie's only other filming location that remains intact is the gymnasium where the Charleston dance competition took place. The gym, which has a swimming pool beneath the floor, is at the Beverly Hills High School.

But the film's neighborhood doesn't look exactly the same. A sign reading 'Welcome to Bailey Park' has been removed, and now large trees hide the houses that could once be seen dotting the street.

Many other famous locations have also changed, whether they've been forgotten or modernized with the times.

The Jack Rabbit Slim's Diner from Quentin Tarantino's 1994 film Pulp Fiction has perhaps changed the most drastically. 

The Glendale, California location used to be a 44-lane bowling alley that had a cocktail bar, billiard room and even a place for children to play as their parents partied away, according to the Glendale News-Press. 

The Church of Saint Mary the Virgin, on 145 West 46th Street in New York, was used to film the exteriors for the high school in 1980's 'Fame' 

The Martini family's home from 'It's A Wonderful Life' also remains unchanged, 67 years after the Christmas classic was filmed

But the location where John Travolta and Uma Thurman famously did the twist has now been shuttered.

Schwab's Pharmacy, featured in 1950 classic Sunset Boulevard, was a real drug store where many movie actors and industry executives hung out. In an episode of 'I Love Lucy,' Lucille Ball tells Desi Arnez she was going to Schwab's to be discovered. 

The pharmacy was demolished in 1983 and a shopping complex featuring a Starbucks stands in its place. 

But the movie's neighborhood doesn't look exactly the same. A sign reading 'Welcome to Bailey Park' has been removed, and now large trees hide the houses that could once be seen dotting the street

Some houses lining the San Francisco streets used in the 1968 Steve McQueen crime film 'Bullitt' haven't even changed their paint job 

Transformations in these movie locations also show how the famous cities that hosted them have likewise changed. 

The historic Golden Nugget casino, featured in the James Bond film 'Diamonds Are Forever,' underwent a $100 million renovation in 2006. 

And The Mint, a casino also seen in the film, was sold in 1988 and is now part of Binion's Horseshoe Casino.  

But the same can't be said for the once fire engine-red building seen in Al Pacino's 'Serpico' in 1973
