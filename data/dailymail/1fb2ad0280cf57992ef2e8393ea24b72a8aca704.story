A Kate Spade tote bag is drawing negative response on social media platforms for seeming to support Ugandan terrorist and warlord Joseph Kony.

The $228 bag, which is clearly intended to read ‘I [heart] KSNY [Kate Spade New York]’, features a playing card ‘spade’ symbol in place of an ‘S’.

But the rotund symbol could also be interpreted as an ‘O’, much to the amusement of many Twitter users.

A mishap?: An abbreviation on Kate Spade's new tote bag is drawing an unfortunate comparison to Ugandan warlord Joseph Kony

On Sunday, Washington D.C.-based PR professional Lauren Jenkins tweeted a photo of the bag saying ‘Not sure Kate Spade thought this design through #ILoveKony.’ The post went semi-viral, receiving over 703 retweets and 719 ‘favorites’.

Responses on Twitter responses ranged from ‘Oh my’, and ‘Yikes’ to ‘He was the glitteriest of the warlords.’

Another wrote: ‘I prefer to think some designer with a sardonic sense of humor did that on purpose.’

A representative for Kate Spade issued the following statement to MailOnline: 'This bag was designed as a celebration of Kate Spade New York, using the abbreviation of our name, kate (spade) new york.  We regret the interpretation of this tote's design and apologize for any misunderstanding.'

They added:  'We take customer feedback seriously and are actively working to withdraw these items from our stores and wholesale partners.'

Kony is an unfortunate comparison for the Kate Spade label, given that he is known to abduct children and turn them into child soldiers – information that came to light in filmmaker Jason Russell’s Kony 2012 documentary that has been watched over 98,500,000 times on YouTube. He is now being sought for arrest by the International Criminal Court.

The tote was issued as part of Kate Spade’s Call To Action collection—a line of bags printed with declarative, millennial-friendly slogans like ‘Eat Cake for Breakfast’ and ‘Tequila Is Not My Friend #bagconeggandcheeseplease’.

It is still available for pre-order through online retailers including Nordstrom.

Made of cotton, leather, and PVC-trim, the item’s online description instructs consumers to ‘show the love with a canvas tote that features leather trim and a hot-pink zip tab.’
