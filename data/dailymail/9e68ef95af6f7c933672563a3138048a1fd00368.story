Acquitted: Joshua Tate, 22, has been found not guilty of assaulting a drunk classmate in 2012

A U.S. Naval Academy football player has been found not guilty of sexual assaulting a drunk classmate at an off-campus party.

Joshua Tate, from Nashville, Tennessee, had been accused of having sex with the woman at a party in 2012 even though she claimed she was too drunk to consent to having sex with him.

Following a three-day trial on Thursday, military judge Col. Daniel Daughtery acquitted Tate, 22, of aggravated sexual assault, saying prosecutors had not proved their case beyond reasonable doubt.

One of Tate's attorneys, Jason Ehrenberg, said his client's reaction to the decision was 'one of great relief' and called him a 'good young man'.

But an attorney for the woman said in a telephone interview after the judge's verdict that 'deeply disappointed doesn't adequately describe' his client's reaction to the case's outcome.

Ryan Guilds said his client was 'appalled by the lack of accountability' and said the case's outcome was a result of a 'flawed military system' and a failed investigation.

The woman, who testified for more than five hours, said she drank heavily before and during the 'Toga and Yoga' party, which was held off-campus near the school in Annapolis, Maryland.

She said she couldn't remember having sex with Tate - but when she found an open condom wrapper and began hearing rumors about her having sex with multiple people at the party, she asked him.

'What you don't remember?' he said, she claimed. 'I'm going to have to refresh your memory.'

Initially, she did not cooperate with investigators and held back information because she wanted the case to go away and did not want to disappoint her mother, she said.

But after the investigation was closed, she had a change of heart and it was reopened.

Prosecutors had tried to show that the alleged victim was too drunk to consent to sexual activity - and was so drunk she could not walk, talk or make decisions clearly.

But two men who had been initially accused in the case denied that she had been that drunk.

One of the men, Eric Graham from Eight Mile, Alabama, told the court that the woman had also performed oral sex on him in a car at the party.

During
 the incident, which occurred after she had allegedly had sex with Tate in the car,
 the woman also asked Graham to have sex, he claimed.

He added that the woman did not appear 'dangerously intoxicated' and was in control of her body.

Another football player who was also initially accused, Tra'ves Bush from Johnston, South Carolina, agreed that she was 'in control of her movements and her speech'. The couple, who had recently ended a casual relationship, had also had sex that night.

The morning after the party, she woke up on a couch with an aching back and asked another Navy football player to feel the knots in her back. About 45 minutes later, she and the player had consensual sex.

Afterwards, he suggested they take a ride back to the Academy with his friends and when she climbed in the car, she recognized it from the night before - and saw an opened condom wrapper.

When she returned to campus, she confronted Tate, who admitted they had had sex.

Bush and Graham were also initially 
accused of sexually assaulting the woman but Tate was the only student 
ultimately brought to court-martial, the military's equivalent of a 
trial.

The military held an Article 32 hearing, which resembles a preliminary hearing in civilian court, in August and September of 2013.

Following that hearing, the academy's head, Vice Admiral Michael H. Miller, decided not to pursue charges against Bush, saying there were no 'reasonable grounds' to believe he committed a crime.

Charges against Graham were dropped in January, which prosecutors had recommended after a military judge said statements he made during an investigation would not be admissible during a military trial.

Just hours before the verdict on Thursday, a separate court-martial unfolding in Fort Bragg, North Carolina also ended in favor of the defense.

Brig.
 Gen. Jeffrey A. Sinclair was reprimanded and docked four months' pay 
but avoided prison time for carrying on a three-year affair with a 
captain who later claimed she had been sexually assaulted.

The
 two cases underscore the military's attempts to grapple with sexual 
misconduct within its ranks.

A Pentagon report released last year 
estimated that as many as 26,000 military members may have been sexually
 assaulted in the prior year and that thousands of victims are unwilling
 to come forward out of fear their careers might be derailed.
