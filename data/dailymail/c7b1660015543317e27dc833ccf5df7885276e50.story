A father-to-be who accidentally ran over and killed his pregnant fiancée outside their baby shower just three weeks before the child was due has been jailed.

Both the unborn baby girl and Jessica Fenner, 22, died following the crash in Morden, Surrey, earlier this year.

Croydon Crown Court heard Daniel Dutfield, 24, who had passed his driving test just a year before, was nearly three times over the legal driving limit when he hit his pregnant partner on July 5 in his turbocharged 1.8l Ford Focus, which had been lowered and a 'racing style' clutch fitted.

Mark Paltenghi, prosecuting, told the court: 'To celebrate the coming of their baby a baby shower and barbecue was held at the defendant's mother's home.

'The defendant said he had drunk about six or seven pints of strong lager. He says he wasn't a drinker and felt drunk after two pints.

'It's clear that at some point during the afternoon things took a turn for the worse as far as the defendant is concerned.'

The court heard a drunken Dutfield had become agitated when members of his family had not shown up to the party.

Mr Paltenghi said: 'He said it was 'p***ing him off' how certain people he'd invited hadn't turned up.

'He then walked out of the house, down the driveway and crossed the street to where his Ford was parked and got in. He was worse for wear from the amount he had drunk.'

He then 'bombed off' down the road, accelerating up to 60mph around the loop of the quiet estate.

Mr Paltenghi said: 'At this point Jessica and her friend discovered the defendant had left. They came out of the house and stood on the street.

'Her friend said she heard the sound of a car engine revving and she saw the defendant's vehicle.'

By the time they were taken to hospital their baby girl was dead and Ms Fenner died the following day

An eye witness said he saw the defendant spin the wheel round like someone trying to get the back end to go out, but it was so quick he lost control.

Mr Paltenghi said: 'It careered from one side of the street to the other, mounted the pavement and collided with a street sign. The momentum of the car caused Jessica to be knocked down.'

He added: 'The insurance company has said that had it known of the vehicle's modifications, particularly, the suspension, they would not have insured him.'

Paramedics were called to the scene at 8.08pm and rushed Ms Fenner to hospital, where her child was pronounced dead on arrival.

She died the following day. 

Police called to the scene gave Dutfield a breath test, which revealed he was 93mg over the 35mg legal limit to drive. 

Dutfield, an apprentice engineer, pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving at Croydon Crown Court in September and has now been jailed for four and a half years.

Dutfield wept  as the court heard the pair, who had been in a relationship for six years, were 'joined at the hip'.

Judge Warwick McKinnon, the Recorder of Croydon, said: 'This is a totally tragic case. Everyone is agreed that this was a freak accident with totally, dreadfully, tragic consequences.

'However you drove drunkenly, aggressively, and at speed, in a residential area. Children could have quite easily been present.

'It's a tragic case, you killed the one you love.'

The court heard Dutfield is suffering from depression and had been deemed a suicide risk in custody

Referring to statement from Ms Fenner's mother, Julie Fenner, which was not read out in court, the judge said she spoke 'movingly' about the 'pain, grief, and all-encompassing anguish of losing a daughter, in such tragic, senseless circumstances.'

He added: 'This was a wholly avoidable and premature death but no sentence I can pass today, whatever its length can restore the human life that has been so senselessly lost.'

Avirup Chaudhuri, defending, said: 'The word tragedy is perhaps over-used these days, but nobody can deny the term is appropriate to this case.'

The court heard Dutfield is suffering from depression and had been deemed a suicide risk in custody, though he had helped prevent the suicides of two other inmates while on remand.

The court also heard he had no previous convictions and no points on his driving licence

Dutfield has been jailed for four and a half years after hitting his pregnant fiancée in his car while over the limit 

In the months prior to her tragic death Miss Fenner, a shop assistant at hardware store Wilkinson's, told family and friends how excited she was to have moved in with her boyfriend and to start a family.

On May 31, the mother-to-be wrote on her Facebook page: 'Had a lovely evening with Dan Dutfield - not long till us 2 become 3 can't wait to meet our beautiful baby girl xx.'

She also shared scans of their baby girl and asked for name suggestions.

Mr Chaudhuri, said: 'He was hard working, dedicated to his girlfriend and wider family and looking forward to becoming a father.

'Any punishment that this court can give will never compare to the torment he puts himself through on a daily basis.'

Dutfield, who appeared in the dock in dark suit and pink shirt, wept as he was sentenced.

He was ordered to pay a £120 surcharge and banned from driving for seven years.

The public gallery was packed with members of both Dutfield and his dead fiancée's family.

Speaking outside Scotland Yard Detective Constable Iain Lister said on behalf of the family: 'The sentence will not bring Jessica back, but we hope it brings some comfort and justice, and that the Fenner family can begin to move on from this tragedy.'
