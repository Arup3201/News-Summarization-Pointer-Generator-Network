Stand on a certain bridge in Texas, hold you breath and get ready to be amazed by what you see.

There are 1.5 million bats living under a
bridge in Austin that make up the world's largest urban bat colony, and
a historic drought is making them hungrier than ever when they come out
for food.

It’s good news for the people who gather each evening just a few blocks from the state Capitol building to watch their spectacular nightly trips into the nearby Hill Country to find nourishment.

The drought has killed off crops in Texas, and that in turn has killed off those delicious pests the Mexican free-tailed bats consider dinner.

They are leaving home earlier than usual each night to find food, giving the locals in the bat-crazy city a few more minutes to watch the normally-nocturnal critters fly before the sun goes down.

Each night they stream from under a bridge by the hundreds of thousands in a black cloud so large that it shows up on a local weather radar.

‘It's wonderful for people to be able to see them, and they are really spectacular,’ said bat conservationist James Eggers. ‘But it's an indicator that things are a little tougher for the bats.’

Austin resident Lawrence Collins joked: ‘They're attracting the tourists to the bridge earlier in the evening. That becomes a serious impediment to getting across the river for Happy Hour.’

The daylight departure is a bittersweet phenomenon, enjoyable to bat lovers only because naturalists do not see any negative long-term effects if the drought ends soon.

Mr Eggers said up to two years of drought is a natural cycle and won’t affect the species as a whole. But some scientists fear it’s not a regular drought but a change coming thanks to global warming.

‘If we have an extended drought for many years, that could affect the population of the Mexican free-tails,’ he said.

An extended drought could be a double whammy for central Texas farmers, who depend on the bats to remove some 1,000 tons of insects and pests from the air each night.

A study in 2006 showed that area cotton farming, which was a $4.5million-a-year industry at the time, saved some $750,000-a-year from pestilence thanks to the Mexican free tails.

Some 100 million bats live in Central Texas. The largest bat colony in the world resides in a cave northwest of San Antonio, with more than 20 million bats living there.

Big eaters: The bats under the bridge consume 10,000 to 30,000lbs of bugs every night and bring in about $8million in tourist revenue every year from the nearly 100,000 people who visit the bat colony each summer

Around March, about 750,000 pregnant females come to downtown Austin and nest under the Congress Street bridge, just blocks from historic Sixth Street and the governor's mansion.

A few months later, they have their babies - one offspring per year - and their numbers double to 1.5 million.

The nightly spectacle, which draws visitors from all over the world, lasts through about October, when the bats return to Mexico.

The bats moved into Austin in the 
1980s when the bridge, then 70 years old, was reinforced with beams that
surprisingly turned out to be a perfect habitat for them.

At first, locals were revolted by the
idea, and ignorant of the benefits of having them as neighbours. There 
was even talk of extermination.

But then an education campaign by the
founder of Mr Eggers's group Bat Conservation International, Dr. Merlin 
D. Tuttle, turned that around. Now, Austin embraces its friends under 
the bridge.

There is a huge bat sculpture next to
downtown. The Official Drink of Austin is the Bat-ini and the bat 
conservation group moved its headquarters from Milwaukee to Austin.

The once-reviled bats are now a point of pride for Austin and coveted by neighbouring cities.

‘The bats are our unofficial mascot. We even had a minor league hockey 
team (the Icebats) named after them at one time. Their return each 
spring marks the beginning of festival season. And, they're weird. Just 
like Austin'

Austin resident Susan Floyd

The Texas Department of Transportation works closely with Mr Eggers's group now to adapt new bridges and roadways across Texas in the same manner as Congress to attract bats.

In Austin alone, the bats bring in some $8million from eco-tourism. But that's not the only reason Austin, which loves to brag about its individuality, adores them.
