A 21-year-old aspiring model from Detroit was captured and charged with murder after police say she stabbed to death a convenience store clerk in Georgia during a robbery.

U.S. Marshals Service spokesman Gavin Duffy said Skyy Raven Maria Mims was arrested at a Bartow County home Tuesday.

Whitfield County sheriff's deputies responded to a service station in Dalton, Georgia, Sunday night and found 37-year-old Dahyabhai Chaudhari dead on the floor in a pool of blood.

The owner of Kanku's Express on Airport Road said Mims allegedly stole only a small sum of cash and a few lottery tickets, Atlanta Journal Constitution reported. 

Law enforcement officials finally caught up with the aspiring rapper and fashion model at around 5pm Tuesday and booked her into the Whitfield County Jail.

According to police, they also seized a stolen Kia Soul, which Mims was reportedly driving on the day of the murder.

Just hours after the deadly stabbing, the 21-year-old woman, who goes by the stage monikers ‘Yo Skyy’ and 'Gorgiee,' reportedly posted the word 'knowledge' on her Facebook and Twitter pages.

The victim, Mr Chaudhari, was popular among his customers and known for his friendly and easy-going demeanor. He had worked at the gas station store for only a few months.

Just before midnight Sunday, a woman in a hooded jacket and gloves later identified as Mims was captured on a surveillance camera entering Kanku’s Express.

A customer later recalled to News channel 9 hearing the store clerk and the woman arguing before they both fell silent. She then got into her car and drove off.

According to investigators, Mims found temporary refuge in the home of her boyfriend’s friend on Springmont Drive in Cartersville.

For two days, the 21-year-old murder suspect laid low, staying at the house with the family’s young daughter, who befriended Mims, reported the station WRCB-TV.

Acting on a tip, police officers surrounded the private residence Tuesday evening and cornered Mims, according to WSB-TV.

At around 4.30pm Wednesday, a makeup-free Mims dressed in red jail garb appeared before a judge for a bond hearing. She is due back in court Friday morning.
