Gay couples who wed less than a week ago have had their marriages annulled after Australia's highest court struck down a law allowing the nation's first same-sex unions.

The weddings were legalised in the capital Canberra on Saturday after regional authorities enacted a gay marriage law - but it was challenged by the government, which said it was invalid.

Today the High Court of Australia agreed, shattering the dreams of more than a dozen couples who had already married this week.

Devastated: Chris Teoh and Ivan Hinton had their wedding, pictured, on Saturday. It will now be annulled

Australia's Prime Minister is against gay marriage and the national Marriage Act was amended in 2004 to define weddings as 'between a man and a
woman'.

The government told the High Court that having different marriage laws in different states would cause confusion.

The Australian Capital Territory, which passed the law in
October, said it should stand because it governs couples outside the 
federal definition of marriage as being between members of the opposite 
sex.

Today the court sided with the government, saying the two laws could not run side-by-side.

Ivan Hinton, who married his partner Chris Teoh on Saturday, had only received their marriage certificate 
on Wednesday and had already applied to change their surnames to 
Hinton-Teoh.

Outside court he said he will always consider Teoh his husband and added: 'This was an unprecedented and historic opportunity. I wouldn't have missed it for the world.'

Upset: A couple hug outside the court. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott is against same-sex unions

Emotion: Couples embrace each other after the ruling, which defeated a regional law made in Capital Territory

The court said in a statement: 'The Marriage Act does not now provide
for the formation or recognition of marriage between same sex couples. 
The Marriage Act provides that a marriage can be solemnised in Australia
only between a man and a woman.

'That Act is a comprehensive and exhaustive 
statement of the law of marriage.'

Rodney
Croome, national director of the advocacy group Australian Marriage 
Equality, said his group knows of about 30 same-sex couples who have 
married since Saturday, though the actual number may be slightly higher.

Conservative: Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott is against gay marriage and blocked two bills

The court decision nullifies their marriages as it means 
the local law under which they were wed was invalid.

Outside the court in Canberra, a tearful Croome, flanked by several same-sex newlyweds, said the ruling was a defeat for marriage equality but there had been a 'greater victory'.

'That victory was the nation saw for the first time, I believe, what is really at the core of this issue,' he said.

'They've seen that marriage equality is not about protest or politics or even about laws in the constitution, ultimately. Marriage equality is about love, commitment, family and fairness.'

The ruling has effectively barred any other Australian states from legalising same-sex marriage, and the decision can now only be taken by the government.

However, Prime Minister Tony Abbott opposes gay
marriage and his coalition blocked two federal bills last year that 
would have allowed legal recognition of same-sex partnerships.

Lyle Shelton, managing director of Australian Christian Lobby, which opposes same-sex marriage, praised the court ruling and said common sense had prevailed.

As for the ruling's impact on the newlywed couples, Shelton said it was 'really sad that they were put in a position' in which they were allowed to marry before the court handed down its judgment.

The ruling comes a day after India's Supreme Court struck down a 2009 lower court decision to decriminalize homosexuality.

The verdict to reinstate gay sex as an 'unnatural act' as part of a 153-year-old colonial law prompted dismay from human rights groups across the world, which condemned the ruling as 'medieval and regressive'.

Homosexual acts in India, in many parts a deeply conservative country, are punishable with life in jail.
