Andy Murray has jumped to the defence of his fiancée Kim Sears after she appeared to launch a furious tirade at his opponent during his Australian Open semi-final victory.

In one of several heated moments during the clash, the usually poised 27-year-old appeared to hurl a string of expletives towards Czech player Tomas Berdych.

As tensions boiled over, the devoted supporter was caught on camera appearing to mouth 'F*****g have that, you Czech flash f***', or 'Take that, you flash f**k’.

Ms Sears was also facing a tennis WAG-off against Tomas Berdych's tanned model partner Ester Satorova (pictured left and right), who looked less impressed as the match developed 

The clip, which was recorded after the camera zoomed in on Ms Sears, sent Twitter into meltdown, with hundreds both amused and shocked by the outburst from Murray's usually-demure other half.

But speaking after the game, Murray said the seemingly uncharacteristic episode was down to 'a lot of tension' whipped up before the match.

He told reporters: 'When there's a lot of tension surrounding something which you (the media) created, which you created, then it's completely normal.

'The whole first set, everyone was tight. My physical trainer, physio, I'm sure for Dani it was uncomfortable.

'Even Tomas, who very rarely says anything on the court, there was tension there for him, as well. Yeah, in the heat of the moment you can say stuff that you regret. And, yeah, that's it.' 

The dramatic outburst came as Murray won a tense baseline rally in the first set to claim a break back against world number 7.

Luckily, there were no microphones nearby to pick up her exact choice of colourful words - but it was evident Ms Sears was deeply invested in the match.

The highly-charged match was the first time Murray and Berdych had come head-to-head since the latter hired Murray's former trainer Dani Vallverdu.

Mr Vallverdu helped Murray win his two grand slam titles and an Olympic gold before they stopped working together in November.

The dynamic dominated the pre-match build-up, despite both players trying to quietly play down tensions between the two camps.

But there was no doubt that it added a fiery edge to the match, with Murray admitting afterwards that there had been acrimonious mood around Melbourne Park.

Murray eventually beat the Czech in four sets, earning himself a spot in the coveted final this weekend. 

Speaking on court, he said: 'A lot was made of Dani working with him. We've been friends since we were 15 and I felt like that was a bit unfair and unnecessary.

'This is sport, there is more to life and I thought it was unfair and created a bit of extra tension. 

Berdych had won six of the 10 matches between him and Murray (pictured during today's game) and beat Rafael Nadal for the first time in nine years in the last eight - but Murray kept up his impeccable form

It was the first time Murray had played Berdych (pictured) since he hired Murray's former coach, which no doubt added a fiery edge to the match 

'It was there definitely at the beginning but I think everyone calmed down after the start of the match.'

But the Scot also used his victory to heap praise on his coach, Amelie Mauresmo.

He said: 'A lot of people criticised me for working with her and I think so far this week we have showed women can be very good coaches as well. 

'Madison Keys, who reached the semi-finals here, is also coached by a woman in Lindsay Davenport and I see no reason why that can't keep moving forward so I am very thankful to Amelie for doing it.

'I would say it was a brave choice from her and hopefully I can repay her in a few days.'  

Meanwhile, on the sidelines, Ms Sears was facing a tennis WAG-off against Berdych's tanned model partner Ester Satorova for the second day running.

Much has been made of the rivalry between the two women, both of whom have recently got engaged to their tennis pros.  

Murray and Berdych both proposed to their respective girlfriends  recently before presenting them with expensive diamond rings. 

U.S television coverage further built up the so-called 'battle of the bling', with ESPN displaying a split screen of Sears and Satorova, with added captions at the bottom showing the estimated worth of their rings

A 50-50 split screen was shown of Sears and Berdych's fiancee Ester Satorova, after which Ms Sears appeared to mouth: 'Oh for f**k sake.'  

Back on court, after coming out on top in a long exchange in the first set, Murray turned in the direction of Vallverdu, who sitting in his opponent's box, and let out a wild roar in celebration.

Berdych was clearly incensed, giving the Scot a long stare as both players walked back to their courtside chair. 

Then, as Murray sat down, he pumped his fist towards his own box, to which Sears responded with a fist pump of her own. 

The pair, both 27, had been together for nine years when Murray proposed in November last year

Moments later, Berdych complained to umpire Pascal Maria about the quality of the tennis balls, to which Murray responded: 'He always does this.'

As Murray let out some expletives in annoyance at his own play, the big screens in Rod Laver Arena further added to the drama.   

It then came to a head between Murray and Berdych after the latter claimed a 76-minute first set.  

But Murray quickly hit back on the court, putting on a convincing display as he clinched the remaining sets 6-0, 6-3, 7-5.

Afterwards,the handshake between the pair at the net was surprisingly civil.

But Berdych later said: 'I'm really not happy and not really in a good mood. I'm very disappointed to lose this match. I had one bad set for the second set, and that's it.'
