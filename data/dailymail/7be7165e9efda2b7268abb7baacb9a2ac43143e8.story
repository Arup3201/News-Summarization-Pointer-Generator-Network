Eastern European workers at a Waterstone’s warehouse have accused bosses of ‘human rights abuses’ after they were ordered to speak English to workmates.

The mainly Polish and Latvian staff at a Midlands distribution centre must use only English during working hours, but are free to talk in their native  language during breaks.

A novel idea: Waterstone's has banned its distribution centre staff from speaking all languages apart from English

This is to prevent English colleagues feeling ‘marginalised’ and ‘isolated’, while also ensuring that instructions and health and safety rules are heeded.

But the immigrant workers, who make up around half the 120-strong workforce, claim the policy is discriminatory.

They have drawn up a petition to hand to bosses which claims the rules constitute ‘breaches of their human rights’.

The rules have been implemented by logistics firm Unipart, which operates the site at Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, for the book retailer.

The foreign workers, who also come from countries such as Lithuania, Hungary, South Africa and Iraq, are being backed by the Unite union.

Unite spokesman Rick Coyle said: ‘It is ridiculous to  employ lots of people from other countries while insisting they must speak among themselves only in English. Unipart has a lot to learn about human nature and respect.’

A spokesman for Unipart said: ‘In order to work at the warehouse all workers must speak English because they will be  following instructions and being managed in English.

‘If half of the workforce speak English and the other half speak other languages then this is not conducive to teamwork and can be divisive.’
