A New York Man rowing across the Atlantic Ocean for the fourth time to raise money for AIDS was left stranded without food or water after pirates from Haiti robbed him.

Victor Mooney was not physically harmed when pirates near the island of Tortuga nabbed his food supply and survival equipment, said a statement released on Thursday by Rubenstein Public Relations.

'Although the pirates left the boat in his possession, Mooney was left with only the clothes on his back,' the statement said, and he 'is currently in an extreme state of distress.'

Robbed: New Yorker Victor Mooney tried for the fourth time to row across the Atlantic Ocean was raided by pirates who left him stranded without food or water near Haiti, according to his publicist

'Local authorities have been alerted of the ordeal and are thoroughly investigating the situation.'

The U.S. Coast Guard says the incident occurred when Victor Mooney began having trouble with his boat on Thursday near Tortuga Island.

The Brooklyn native was headed back to the U.S. from his trans-Atlantic journey but had diverted toward Haiti on advice of his U.S. weather router.

Mooney said he saw several fishing boats approach and that people aboard them began yelling in a language he did not understand as they tied his boat to theirs.

The Huffington Post reports that Mooney was rowing by himself towards Miami with an end goal of reaching New York City.

Fourth time's no charm:Victor Mooney made failed attempts at the same journey in 2006, 2007, 2011, and his most recent one this year that left him without food or water after being robbed 

His location: Victor Mooney was allegedly robbed near the Tortugas Island, Gulf of California, Mexico

Stranded: The U.S. Coast Guard says the incident occurred when Victor Mooney began having trouble with his boat on Thursday near Tortuga Island

He braved a 5,000 mile crossing beginning in the Canary Islands in February.

Two weeks prior to the alleged incident, Mooney left a port from the north coast of the Dominican Republic around 140 miles to the east of Tortuga.

This isn't Mooney's first attempt at rowing across the Atlantic Ocean.

In 2006 his boat leaked just hours after leaving from Senegal in Africa.

In 2007 he only made it 15 days before he had to be rescued after his desalination system was non-functional.

In 2011 he nearly met his bitter end, drifting 15 days in a life raft after his boat overflowed with water.

Mooney has not been in the condition to say whether or not he will attempt the perilous journey once again.
