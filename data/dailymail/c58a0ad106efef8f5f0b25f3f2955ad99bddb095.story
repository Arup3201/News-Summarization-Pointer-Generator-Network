Plenty of television innovations have come along over the years, promising to ‘change for ever’ our viewing habits.

First came colour pictures on BBC2 in 1967. Then it was Sky. Next there was Freeview. 3D was hailed as the next breakthrough. TV on your mobile phone was another.

But, as yet, few have matched the popularity of multi-channel packages. Now, though, the new YouView system is being touted as the technology that could change the way we watch TV.

Innovation: The new YouView system enables viewers to make use of TV catch-up services regardless of their computer skills

The principle of the system is, like all the best ideas, simple and intriguing.

While iPlayer from the BBC and the equivalent catch-up services from other broadcasters enable you to view shows you’ve missed, they involve a modicum of basic computer skills. For those people who are able to grasp these, it’s also possible to connect a laptop showing iPlayer to your TV.

But YouView has for the first time integrated standard TV and internet TV in a more or less seamless way, so archived programmes on these ‘catch-up’ services can be fed into your living room TV regardless of your computer skills.

The main advantage of YouView is that it has an on-screen guide (accessible at the touch of a button), showing programmes that were screened during the past seven days as well as those due to be broadcast over the next seven days on all the main channels.

Even the dreaded ‘buffering’, the frustrating intermittent delay often experienced while programmes download to a computer, has largely been done away with.

And by removing all the hassles involved in using the TV stations’ already available catch-up services, YouView has pulled off the trick much-loved by clever firms — taking a technology that’s already proven and adding a bit of magic to make it easy to use and desirable. 

In fact, being able to go back in time on your programme guide already exists on Virgin Media, but the launch of YouView is expected to see it really take off.

The YouView system has for the first time integrated standard TV and internet TV in a 'more or less seamless' way

YouView has other benefits.

The main one is that it gets you a wider variety of channels than a standard Freeview box, but without any subscription charges.

YouView offers more than 70 TV and radio channels, some in high definition, as well as a further 300 so-called ‘content providers’, such as Amazon’s Lovefilm (the online film rental service), which are in the process of joining the service.

Lovefilm has already announced as a first step that anyone subscribing to a phone and internet package with TalkTalk who opts for a YouView box will get 12 months access to its film and television library.

Newly released films and paid-for sports events will also soon be available on a pay-as-you-go basis - and without the need for a satellite dish.

However, the major drawback to YouView is that even though there are no subscriptions to pay, it will be expensive to get the initial equipment.

The YouView set top box currently being sold costs £299.

But these start-up costs are expected to soon come down. Many internet service providers — such as BT and TalkTalk - will soon be offering a YouView box as part of their broadband deal, typically for no more than a £50 charge. Existing BT and TalkTalk customers will be offered a £50 upgrade to the new box.

So if you think you would benefit from YouView’s ‘TV time traveller’ facility - and you baulk at those expensive Sky and Virgin subscriptions - is YouView the innovation for you?

Here are a few questions you may be asking . . .

So is this cable, satellite or what?YouView is neither and requires no drilling or messy installation. Presuming you have a good outdoor aerial, you can access the 70 or so Freeview channels with no fuss. To get full use of the service, however, you’ll need a broadband connection running at a minimum speed of 3 Mbps — which is not yet available in some rural areas. Ideally, you’ll need 5 Mbps. If you have a satellite dish but no longer have an aerial, you would need to get one installed — and check that there’s a good old-fashioned TV signal in your area — not always the case in some parts of the countryside.

Will it work with an older TV?Yes, but they won’t allow you to experience the box’s high definition (HD) capabilities.

How many channels can it get? YouView gets all the 74 Freeview channels, plus a lot of radio stations. Then, apart from the programme guide, there’s a section called On Demand, where you can find iPlayer and all the other main catch-up websites. Hundreds of other channels are planning to set up in the On Demand section. 

Can it get Sky Sports?This is the big question - especially for many men. The answer is ‘no’ - unless you get your YouView box by subscribing to TalkTalk and signing up for their broadband deal, on which you can pay for Sky Sports one to four. If you get YouView through BT, or buy a box outright in a High Street shop, you can’t yet get Sky Sports.

Does it bump up internet costs?Yes - it’s important to check your current broadband contract doesn’t have a data limit. Older broadband contracts didn’t envisage people getting most of their TV from the internet, and downloading, say, an HD film could use 3Gb — which may be a large part of your monthly data allowance, after which you will be surcharged. The kind of broadband contracts offered with a new YouView box will offer unlimited data.

What if you’ve got two or more TV sets?The YouView box works only with one TV; if you want YouView in other rooms, you’ll need to buy more boxes. Several boxes can ‘feed’ off one broadband connection, but the wiring required is complex and you’ll need to pay an engineer to fix it.

Is it worth buying now, or is it best to wait?Now is fine if you don’t mind the steep initial price. Because the box is internet connected, any upgrades will be made automatically by YouView, so new features — such as the crucial Sky Sports — will be added to your box. 

Can I control what my kids watch?Yes, and also, if you try to watch something recorded after the watershed in daylight hours, a warning will flash up and a PIN number will be requested — which hopefully your children won’t know.

So what are YouView’s drawbacks? Not many - something which worries the likes of Sky. No wonder Rupert Murdoch initially tried to block YouView setting up. One current niggle is that the first box launched doesn’t have built-in Wi-Fi, meaning you have to plug it into your router. Of course this is not very convenient though, and a strange oversight, since so many millions of homes have Wi-Fi.
