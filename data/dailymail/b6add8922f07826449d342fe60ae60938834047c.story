English football should set a target of at least 20 per cent of professional coaches being from black and ethnic minority (BME) backgrounds by 2020, according to a new report.

The report, carried out by the Sports People's Think Tank (SPTT), has revealed BME coaches fill only 3.4 per cent of positions in England, despite making up 25 per cent of professional players.

Figures also show 19 out of the 552 senior coaching positions at England's 92 league clubs are currently held by coaches from BME backgrounds, who make up just 6.4 per cent of those with the FA UEFA Pro Licence - England's top coaching qualification.

The research, funded by Football Against Racism in Europe (The Fare Network), points to 'institutional discrimination' and is urging governing bodies to set 'an overall target of at least 20 per cent of coaches in professional football be from BME backgrounds by 2020'.

Former Reading, Blackburn and Wigan striker Jason Roberts, who is a founding member of the think tank, told a meeting with MPs on Monday: 'I'm confident this report will increase the pressure because this debate has been going on a long time.

'Ten years ago we had three black managers, this season we had no black managers so it's not a matter of time.

'There's a hidden resistance in football stopping managers coming through.'

Roberts added in the report: 'It appears that football has lost successive generations of potential coaches and managers simply because they are black or from other ethnic minority backgrounds.

'The numbers do not add up, so many players from our communities who have achieved so much on the field of play - distinguished careers as senior players in some of the biggest clubs in this country, many with international caps, some who played at major tournaments - yet so few that have been given opportunities to achieve as coaches.

'Talk to these individuals about the realities they faced, the number of jobs they applied for, the number of interviews they had, and the feeling emerges that they have been the victims of a systematic denial of talent and ambition.'

Keith Curles is one of the 3.4 per cent of black and ethnic minority (BME) coaches employed in England 

To boost the number of BME coaches in English football, SPTT recommends a 'positive action scheme' similar to that used in America's National Football League, which makes it compulsory for employers to interview minority candidates.

It also put forward plans for networking events aimed at extinguishing an 'insider culture' where jobs are handed out based on 'who you know, not what you know'.

Loughborough University's Dr Stephen Bradbury, who carried out the report, concluded: 'Taken together, these findings highlight the limited transition of BME players into coaching and leadership positions in English professional football and the overwhelmingly White landscape of the senior decision making tiers of the sport.'

PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor attended the meeting in Westminster along with several football figures, including QPR head of football operations Les Ferdinand and former Tottenham first-team coach Chris Ramsey, who now works with QPR's academy.

Taylor said: 'Nowhere can the global village be seen better than on a football field but there is a stage two - an average playing career is only eight years.

'There is a clear, blatant and obvious piece of the jigsaw missing with regard to management and coaches.

More than 25 per cent of players are from BME background, including Sammy Ameobi and Wayne Routledge

'People always say why you can't do things but we can because any sane and right-minded person would know it is a natural follow-through.

'You can have top-class black managers the same as you can have top-class black players. That's what this campaign is about.

'It's not just an opinion now - it's an argument based on facts, reason and logic.'

The Football Association's Inclusion Advisory Board chair Heather Rabbatts said the governing body welcomed the report.

'It adds further evidence that bodies across the game need to work together to challenge discrimination,' she said in a statement on the FA website.

'This report underlines why we all need to continue to work together, to address the lack of BAME representation beyond the pitch and the 'closed systems' which maintain it.

'At The FA, we are committed to the long term programme of change from working with the PFA on preparing ex-players for the boardroom with the On Board programme, to developing our coach educator workforce from BAME backgrounds and introducing new mentoring opportunities for BAME coaches with the England development teams.

'We look forward to discussing these ideas with the FARE network and the Sports People's Think Tank and also working with the sports minister to bring all parties together to maintain the momentum of change and build, on the work already under way across the game.'
