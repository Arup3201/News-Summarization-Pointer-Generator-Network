A grainy sonar image captured off an uninhabited Pacific island could show the remains of Amelia Earhart’s doomed plane which disappeared in 1937.

The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) say the latest evidence could be a step closer to finding out the mystery behind her disappearance.

Earhart, then 39, was on the final stage of an 
an ambitious around-the-world flight along the equator in a twin-engine 
Lockheed Electra when she and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared.

The image was captured off an uninhabited tropical island in the southwestern Pacific republic of Kiribati and showed an 'anomaly' at a depth of 600 feet in the waters.

Aim: The purpose of the expedition was to test the hypothesis that the Earhart aircraft, after landing on the reef at Gardner Island (now Nikumaroro), was subsequently washed over the reef edge, broke up in the surf, and sank

Location: The anomaly is in the catchment area at the base of the second cliff

'What initially got our attention is that there is no other sonar return like it in the entire body of data collected,' Ric Gillespie, executive director of TIGHAR, told Discovery News.

'It is truly an anomaly, and when you're looking for man-made objects against a natural background, anomalies are good,' he added.

TIGHAR  have spent years investigating Earhart's 
last, fateful flight and now according to their researchers, a sonar image shows a strong return from a narrow object roughly 22 feet long oriented southwest/northeast on the slope near the base of an underwater cliff.

This ties in with a theory that Earhart
 was able to put her aircraft down safely on the reef, but it was washed
 off the edge before aircraft searching for her were able to spot it.

Nikumaroro, uninhabited in Earhart's 
time, and a mere 3.7 miles long by 1.2 miles wide, is about 300 miles 
southeast of Howland Island.

The holder of several aeronautical records, including the first woman to cross the Atlantic by air, Earhart had set off from New Guinea to refuel at Howland Island for a final long-distance hop to California.

In what turned out to be her final radio message, she declared she was unable to find Howland and that fuel was running low.

Several search-and-rescue missions 
ordered the next day by then-president Franklin Roosevelt turned up no 
trace of Earhart or Noonan, who were eventually presumed dead at sea.

Enduring riddle: American aviator Amelia Earhart, posing by her plane in Long Beach, California, in 1930, disappeared while flying over the Pacific in 1937

Fate: The Electra taking off from Oakland Airport at Alameda, California, on the first leg of her proposed world spanning flight

Nikumaroro Island: Researchers will scour the island for clues and crash debris

TIGHAR are operating under the hypothesis
 that the duo survived the crash, reached Gardner Island - which was 
then a British possession and now known as Nikumaroro - and managed to 
survive there for an unknown period of time.

TIGHAR believe that some key components of Earharts aircraft-
 such as the heavy Pratt & Whitney engines may still be left. 

Last year they returned to the island again equipped with a multi-beam sonar array mounted on a ship to construct a map of the underwater topography off the western end of the atoll.

They also used a Autonomous Underwater Vehicle to collect data along the west end of Nikumaroro, as well as a Remote Operated Vehicle capable of reaching depths of 3,000 feet, which produced hours upon hours of high-definition video.

But their recent expedition faced a number of technical problems coupled by the atoll’s difficult environment.

When the search failed to turn up dramatic and conclusive evidence proving that Earhart perished on the island, some media outlets were quick to declare the $2.2million mission a failure.

But on reflection the team realised they had found an 'anomaly' in the vast data they had collected.

Discussing the discovery on their website this week, they wrote: 'The better a piece of evidence looks, the harder you have to try to disqualify it. So far, the harder we’ve looked at this anomaly, the better it looks. Maybe the anomaly is a coral feature that just happens to give a sonar return unlike any other coral feature on the entire reef slope.

Discovery: This bottle of St Joseph's lineament was found on a desert island in the area Amelia Earhart is believed to have crashed on an ill-fated voyage around the world in 1937

Clue: This hunk of glass is from a bottle of Campania's Italian balm made in 1933

Amelia's freckles: Reassembled jar fragments (left) found alongside other artifacts on an island have been found to resemble a freckle ointment (right) possibly used by Earhart

Cosmetic: One of the substances found on the island was identified as rouge from the early 20th century

'Maybe it’s a sunken fishing boat that isn’t mentioned in any of the historical literature. Maybe it’s the boat nobody knows about that that brought the castaway nobody missed who died at the Seven Site. Maybe it’s pure coincidence that it‘s the right size and shape to be the Electra wreckage.'

Sustaining the search are clues worthy of detective story, including items from the 1930s previously discovered on the island such as a jar of face cream, a penknife blade, the heel of a woman's shoe and a bit of Plexiglas - all believed to belong to Earhart and her plane.

Skeletons of birds apparently cooked over a campfire have also contributed to the mystery, and settlers who reached Nikumaroro after 1937 have spoken of the existence of aircraft wreckage.

Conspiracy theories about Earhart's final moments have flourished for years. One contended that Earhart was held by Japanese imperial forces as a spy.

Another claimed she completed her flight, but changed her identity and settled in New Jersey.

Earhart's story - as well as her mysterious demise - have captivated America for decades.

She has been portrayed on the big screen by A-List actresses like Diane Keaton, Amy Adams and Hillary Swank.

Intrigue: In her day, Earhart was extremely popular, but her mysterious death has kept that fame alive 75 years later

The most widely accepted theory is that the aircraft ran out of fuel and ditched in the sea. There have been several searches by many different professionals eager to solve the mystery, but none have been proven.

Another popular theory is that they landed on the island of Nikumaroro in the Pheonix Islands, 350 miles southeast of Howland Island and fended for themselves for several months until they succumbed to injury or disease.

Improvised tools and bits of Plexiglas that are consistent with that of an Electra window were found on the island.

A few theorists reckon that she Earhart was spying on Japan and had been captured and executed. This theory has been discounted by the American authorities and press.

A rumour claimed that she was one of many women sending messages on Tokyo Rose, an English-language Japanese propaganda station designed to attack the Allies' morale.

An Australian aircraft engineer said he found a map that showed Earhart and Noonan may have turned round to try and refuel but crashed before getting to an airstrip.

The most whacky theory is that she was still alive and had a different identity.

A woman from New Jersey successfully sued for $1.5m in damages from the author of a book who pursued this theory.
