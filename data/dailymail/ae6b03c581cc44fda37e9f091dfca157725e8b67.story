Social networking and blogging sites were once reserved for photos of cocktails, cute 
animals and 'food porn'.

Then
came the dreaded 'selfie' - a trend for turning one's camera on oneself
and posting the (usually highly flattering and edited) results online.

Now a new breed of 'mini-me selfie' looks set to take off thanks to one photographer who has documented her pregnancy in a series of beautiful photographs.

Photographer Sophie Starzenski documents her pregnancy in photos, with her bump beginning to show (R) at week 4

Argentinian born photographer Sophie Starzenski documented her pregnancy in photographs, taking a picture at week 4 , week 15 , week 20 , 25 , 29 , 33 , 37 , 40 and then finally with her two month old son, Simon.

The 28-year-old, who was born in Buenos Aires, learned the art of photography at the age of 18 studing with the Italian photographer, Aldo Bressi.

The 28-year-old who hails from Buenos Aires has been studying photography since she was 18. The images here show her at week 15 of her pregnancy (L) and at week 20 (R)

At 19 Sophie started attending different courses and decided photography was more than a hobby. Her stomach is seen swelling at 25 weeks (L) and at 29 weeks (R)

Nearly there! Sophie's snaps, taken with a professional camera, show her in the third trimester at 33 weeks (L) and 37 weeks (R)

She began working in a lab and developing her own copies and at aged 19 she enrolled on various photography courses and decided it was more than just a hobby.

Sophie loves to travel and takes her camera with her everywhere she goes to capture her memories.

She has participated in expositions in her hometown of Buenos Aires, as well as working freelance and collaborating with local media.

The final stages: The last two snaps show her at 40 weeks (L) and then finally with her two month old son Simon (R)
