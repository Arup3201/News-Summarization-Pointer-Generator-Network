Naomi Cambell has denied accusations that she 'bullied' a contestant on her modelling competition show The Face.

Kira Dikhtyar, 24, from Russia, said that the supermodel's attitude had caused her psychological damage and claimed that the network is still paying for her psychiatrist.

'Naomi hates Russians,' said the aspiring model, who appears in the second season of Naomi's panel show set to debut next month.

'She's an amazing woman, but it's very hard to work with her. She put all her [negative] energy on me,' said Kira.

'After filming ended, they sent me to doctors. I'm still recovering,' she added, in an interview with New York Post.

Meanwhile, Naomi's team have categorically refuted Kira's claims.

'We're sorry Kira is unwell and we hope she gets the help she obviously needs,' a source close to the model told Vogue.co.uk.

'Her allegations are absurd,' the source added.

Kira, a former gymnast from Russia, appears on the American version of the show, which also has a British series. The shows aim to find the new face of modelling by asking contestants to compete in various tasks including speed-styling and runway walking.

Naomi, 43, is one of three model coaches and is also the executive producer.

A spokesperson for Oxygen, the TV channel airing The Face US added: 'These claims are false. Naomi and her fellow coaches are utmost professionals and judge the contestants on their ability as aspiring supermodels solely, and viewers will see this as â€˜The Faceâ€™ unfolds.'

Nigel Barker, noted fashion photographer and host of The Face US also leapt to Naomi's defence on Twitter saying: 'Sad when folk who r given an opportunity stoop to these levels casting untrue accusations @NaomiCampbell is a professional #TheFace @oxygen'
