A Ryanair flight was forced to make an unscheduled landing after a tyre burst while it was taking off from Edinburgh Airport.

Passengers reported hearing a loud bang and the flight crew in charge of the Boeing 737-800 decided to abort the journey to Dublin and make an immediate return to the Scottish airport.

Despite the blown tyre the plane landed safely shortly after 8am and taxied to a remote part of the airport to be inspected by an engineer.

Ryanair flight 813 turned around south of Falkirk and then briefly circled before landing safely

Passenger Keiran Steel, 20, told The Scotsman that he heard a ‘big bang’ moments after the plane’s wheels lifted off the runway.

He said: ‘Some people were screaming and there were kids crying.’

Passenger Rami Okasha tweeted a photo of fire trucks which met the twin-engine plane when it returned to Edinburgh Airport about ten minutes after take-off.

He wrote: ‘On a Ryanair plane stuck at Edinburgh. Unfortunately a tyre exploded on takeoff and we had to land again rather suddenly. All well.’

Other passengers on flight 813 complained about the delay, which lasted more than seven hours, and a shortage of vouchers to cover lunch costs.

Ryanair described the incident as a ‘precautionary air turn back’ and said no emergency was declared

Passenger Tony Gowland was unhappy with Ryanair's customer service while he was delayed in Edinburgh

Jenny Duncan said: ‘Idly wondering if we will get another voucher from Ryanair as I have spent my 3.50 and it’s now lunchtime.’

Tony Gowland added: ‘4.5 hours to replace a blown tyre, and just a £3.50 food voucher to apologise. Last time I fly @Ryanair’.

While passengers waited inside the terminal the plane was inspected by an engineer who was sent from Ryanair’s base at Prestwick Airport about 70 miles away in South Ayrshire. Passengers reboarded shortly before 4pm to continue their journey to Dublin.

After a lengthy delay passengers boarded a second time and departed for Dublin shortly before 4pm

A Ryanair spokeswoman described the incident as a ‘precautionary air turn back’ and said no emergency was declared.

She added: ‘A flight from Edinburgh to Dublin today suffered a burst tyre on take-off from Edinburgh Airport.

‘The aircraft returned to Edinburgh and landed normally, and customers disembarked and were provided with refreshment vouchers.

Passengers reported hearing a loud bang and the flight crew in charge of the Boeing 737-800 decided to abort the journey to Dublin

‘A Ryanair engineer was sent from Prestwick to replace the tyre and the aircraft will depart for Dublin shortly.

‘Ryanair sincerely apologised to all those affected by the delay to their journey.’
