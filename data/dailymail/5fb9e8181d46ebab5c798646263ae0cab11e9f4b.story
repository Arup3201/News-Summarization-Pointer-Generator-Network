Crackdown: David Cameron will unveil plans to stamp out the 'scandal' of binge drinking

David Cameron will declare war on the scourge of cheap alcohol today.

As part of a series of measures to stamp out what he condemns as the ‘scandal’ of binge drinking, the Prime Minister will make clear the Government wants to introduce a minimum price for alcohol and put higher taxes on strong lagers.

He will throw his weight behind plans to emulate Scotland where supermarkets and pubs are forced to charge a minimum of 45p per unit of alcohol to prevent the cut-price selling blamed for fuelling the orgy of public drunkenness.

His wide-ranging crackdown will also include plans for:

On a trip to a hospital in the North East, Mr Cameron will announce that treating patients with alcohol problems and victims of drunken attacks costs the NHS £2.7billion a year, or £90 for every taxpayer in Britain.

Last year there were 200,000 hospital admissions with a primary alcohol-related diagnosis, 40 per cent higher than in 2003. The number of patients admitted with acute intoxication has more than doubled to 18,500 over the same period.

Mr Cameron will say: ‘This is one of the scandals of our society and I am determined to deal with it. This is an area where the drinks industry, supermarkets, pubs and clubs need to work with government so that responsible drinking becomes a reality and not just a slogan.

‘Whether it’s the police officers in A&E that have been deployed in some hospitals, the booze buses in Soho and Norwich, or the drunk tanks used abroad, we need innovative solutions to confront the rising tide of unacceptable behaviour.’

Senior sources say the plans will be published in full in the Government’s long-awaited alcohol strategy due next month, but final decisions could be delayed until the Budget on March 21 since decisions on duty would have to be announced to Parliament by the Chancellor.

The plans are bound to provoke scepticism as to whether raising prices will be enough to change the behaviour of young drinkers, but they are supported by groups like Alcohol Concern.

Tory MPs have also expressed concerns about minimum pricing, amid fears that voters would be angered by paying extra for alcohol during a time of austerity.

But Mr Cameron is willing to overrule embattled Health Secretary Andrew Lansley, who fears minimum pricing will hurt the poor, because it would be popular with many in the medical profession who are fighting the Government’s NHS reforms.

Mr Cameron will say: ‘Every night, in town centres, hospitals and police stations across the country, people have to cope with the consequences of alcohol abuse. And the problem is getting worse.

‘Over the last decade we’ve seen a frightening growth in the number of people – many under-age – who think it’s acceptable to get drunk in public in ways that wreck lives, spread fear and increase crime.

‘As figures today show, the NHS is having to pick up an ever-growing bill of £2.7billion a year, including £1billion on accident and emergency services alone. That’s money we have to spend because of the reckless behaviour of an irresponsible minority.

‘Across the country hospitals, ambulance crews and the police are rising to the challenge. We must help them to do so and will be setting out how through the forthcoming Alcohol Strategy.

‘This isn’t just about more rules and regulation. It’s about responsibility and a sense of respect for others.’

A recent official study found that setting a minimum price of 30p a unit would prevent 300 deaths a year, 40p about 1,000 deaths, and 50p more than 2,000 premature deaths.

The new measures will be accompanied by an ‘aggressive’ public health campaign and a more draconian approach to curtailing the sale of alcohol in shops, pubs and clubs.

In America, police keep cells aside as ‘drunk tank’ holding pens for binge-drinkers to be incarcerated until they sober up.

For the past two years an alcohol recovery centre has been set up in Soho, London, over the Christmas period.

Drunken revellers are given advice on alcohol abuse as they recover from their nights out and wait to be collected by friends or family.

A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘A final decision is to be taken on the alcohol strategy, but this is an idea the Prime Minister has said publicly that he is interested in.’
