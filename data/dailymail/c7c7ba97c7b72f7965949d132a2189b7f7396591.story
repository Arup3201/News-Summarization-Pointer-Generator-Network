Oscar Tabarez claimed Luis Suarez had been made a worldwide scapegoat by FIFA during an extraordinary press conference at the Maracana on Friday evening.

Tabarez read a pre-prepared 13-minute statement to claim that pressure from the English media after he bit Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini last Tuesday forced FIFA to ban him for four months.

The Uruguay coach then immediately quit his position on FIFA’s technical committee and told Suarez that he has the full support of his country’s people.

Tabarez was then applauded out of the press auditorium by fawning Uruguayan journalists.

Tabarez 
said: ‘Many times you forget the scapegoat is a person who has rights 
and that in this specific case, besides the mistakes and faults he has 
committed, he has made significant contributions on the pitch. It is the
 contribution made by great football players is essential.

‘As
 a coach and a professor, and as a former teacher, I am presented with 
the theory of the scapegoat. You know what I am talking about, of giving
 a punishment, to someone who commits a transgression, not a crime.

‘We
 know the protagonists and not only because of the profile he has 
because of the mistakes, but there is another side to him. That is a 
message: the severity was excessive. 

‘Perhaps
 I do have the answers but like many people, those who not only have to 
make disciplinary decisions - who wins? Who loses? Who benefits? Who is 
harmed? Who got things their way?

‘To
 one of these questions, I will not give you a final answer, but I will 
try to find a response. On the basis of these exaggerated decisions, 
only with decisions of this nature I doubt it. After the Suarez and 
Chiellini episode we have seen other things measured with a different 
measure. 

‘When
 that happens we have the omission because not all cases have to do with
 the transgression with indiscipline. Unavoidably this leads to 
exaggeration in terms of punishment. 

‘We should punish and sanction, but one must always give the opportunity to hear from the person.’

Tabarez
 was highly critical of FIFA’s disciplinary panel after they failed 
to give Suarez the chance to speak for himself after the incident with 
Chiellini.

The
 Uruguay coach, preparing for Saturday’s World Cup second round match 
against Colombia in the Maracana, urged the country’s supporters to 
‘rebel’ against the decision.

Tabarez
 said: ‘And to conclude to Luis Suarez, the person, the person who has 
always co-existeed with us and we know him better than anyone else, the 
path that he covered is a path that he will go through attempting to 
start again to be better.

‘To let him know that he will never be alone in that attempt. To the Uruguayan fans, they are moved with the sanctions and to let them know we are hurt with an outstanding force and with the desire to rebel. So more than ever before we will do our utmost.’

Tabarez then went on to explain the reasons behind his decision to quit a FIFA technical study group.

He said: ‘We have the right to express our opinions as coach of Uruguay representing us at this World Cup.

‘I trained and grew up in Uruguay as a footballer and a coach. I would also like to appear before you with my background as a coach. Since I was linked to international competitions I was a hardcore defender of fair play, of the developments of values and that aspect has led me to awards and recognition by FIFA of the merits and the organisations such as UNESCO that has declared me a champion. This is recognition and awards and distinctions that I will forever have close to my heart.

‘When an inquiry is established because of fault or omission caused by a football player seen or not seen and therefore not sanctioned and you resort to videos to establish what happened. 

‘At the match we had not seen the images. But because of the inquiry that was opened and we saw the images we saw that there was a possibility that punishment of the participants, Giorgio Chiellini and Suarez, that both would be punished.

‘I cannot deny that we were waiting for the referee to caution or the corresponding disciplinary sanction.

‘We never thought that we were told that the details of the FIFA decision reached of an excessive severity. 

‘Any decision which obviously is much more focused on the opinions of the media, the media that attacked immediately after the match. And in the press conference, journalists that only took the only topic. 

‘And, I don’t know what their nationality was, but they all spoke English. Just like we are close to the media pressure we were quite away from the objective date from the match.

‘When I speak with media attacks, the topic that they concentrated on was above all the history of Luis and the things that have happened in the past.

‘We know of the sanctions, in spite of these harassment we know where the power lies. I will not discuss that.

'That doesn’t mean we should accept it and the indiscriminate use of that power, the disciplinary committee, which is there to impart justice.’

Tabarez intends to resign from FIFA after their World Cup clash with Colombia following the decision to suspend Suarez. He has the complete support of his players over his decision to suspend Suarez and he refused to take a single question.

Tabarez added: ‘Many years ago, I started being linked to FIFA as attache and the technical study group at World Cups and youth tournaments and other events. 

‘I had a position and I must leave that position. It is not wise or prudent to be in an organisation with people who exerted pressure, those who rendered the award, who managed criteria and values that are different to the ones I have. Therefore in the coming days I will file my resignation to that position because of these reasons.’
