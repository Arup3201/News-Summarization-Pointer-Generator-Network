An in-flight magazine is warning travellers to leave their copies of George Orwell’s classic novel 1984 at home if they visit Thailand.

Twitter users have been circulating a photo of the article – apparently found in a Philippines Airlines magazine – which advises visitors how they can ‘blend in’ and avoid trouble as Thailand remains under strict military rule.

The article warns: ‘Don’t carry George Orwell’s dystopian novel, “1984.” You don’t want to be mistaken for “an anti-coup protester.”’

Published in 1949, Orwell’s influential novel about life in a totalitarian surveillance state has reportedly been banned in Thailand, where it has become a symbol of political protest against a repressive military regime that seized power in a bloodless coup in May.

Anti-coup protesters have staged silent readings as an act of resistance against the military junta and there has been at least one arrest.

In June, a man was dragged away by half a dozen undercover police officers while reading 1984 outside an upscale shopping mall in Bangkok, the Associated Press reported.

The in-flight magazine lists five tips for visitors to Thailand, including the warning about 1984.

The article encouraged travellers to carry their passports at all times, avoid wearing red T-shirts that are associated with anti-coup protesters, ask for permission before snapping a selfie with a soldier and avoid getting into debates about the pros and cons of the coup.

The article reads: ‘Despite being under military control, Thailand is very safe for tourists.’

Philippines Airlines offers twice daily service between Manila and Bangkok.

The Foreign & Commonwealth Office makes no mention of the book in its travel advisory for Thailand, but it carries this warning for holidaymakers: ‘It’s illegal to criticise the coup and you should be wary of making political statements in public. You should monitor local news and social media for developments.

‘Over recent months there have been large-scale planned demonstrations, and spontaneous protests, in Bangkok and other cities. Some of these have turned violent. You should avoid any protests, political gatherings, demonstrations or marches.’

Over 800,000 British nationals visit Thailand every year, according to the FCO.
