Gareth Bale has hailed a ‘dream come true’ for the Real Madrid winger to head home to Cardiff and play the Super Cup Final in front of his friends and family.

The former Tottenham and Southampton star is used to playing in Wales with the hopes of a nation on his shoulders but this time he will take his Real Madrid side full of Galacticos back to Wales.

Real Madrid take on fellow La Liga side Sevilla next Tuesday at the Cardiff City Stadium for the first available piece of silverware of the new season and Bale is excited by the prospect.

La Decima: The Welshman won the Champions league and Copa del Rey during his first season in Madrid

Bale told Spanish newspaper Marca: ‘I was born there, I’ve been raised there, and I have a lot of friends and family still there.

‘For me it’s a special place I always go back to when I get a chance.’

The Welshman had a fantastic opening season in Madrid scoring 22 goals, including the winner in the Copa del Rey final against arch rivals Barcelona.

He also scored a crucial goal back in May to secure Real Madrid their precious ‘La Decima’, a tenth Champions League crown.

Homecoming: Bale has 44 caps for Wales and 12 goals since making his debut in 2006

‘I knew the Super Cup would be played in Cardiff a good 18 months ago.

‘When I came to Real Madrid it was always a dream of mine that if we could win the Champions League we could play in Cardiff. Now that dream has come true.’

The match will be a real family occasion for Bale and he’s all set for a hero’s welcome back in the city where his Mother Debbie still lives and works with just a four mile trip from the stadium to his old primary school.

Winner: The forward scored a superb winning goal against arch rivals Barcelona in the Copa Del Rey final

In fact Bale’s uncle Chris Pike used to play for Cardiff City at their former ground Ninian Park and Bale used to go and watch from the age of just three.

‘All my friends and family will be there, we’ve got as many tickets as possible.

'It will be a great occasion for me to come back to my hometown for Real Madrid and to play in Cardiff is special for me.'

Welsh wizards: Bale caught up with Wales legend Ryan Giggs before a pre-season match in the United States

With his place in Real Madrid history, Bale will attempt  to create more history in Cardiff, aiming to become the first Welshman to win the Super Cup since three Manchester United players succeeded over 20 years ago, when Bale was just two years old.

Ryan Giggs, Clayton Blackmore and Mark Hughes, participated in United’s 1991 win over Red Star Belgrade and Bale will hope to follow in their footsteps when he returns to his hometown.
