A restaurant which launched an online wedding competition has been forced to scrap the contest after cyber bullies trolled the entrants.

The Tavistock Retro in South Shields, South Tyneside, launched the Â£7,000 giveaway to coincide with its third anniversary, offering four couples the chance to battle it out for the dream wedding.

To win the prize the couples had to compete by saying why they deserved the prize and try to gain the restaurant more likes on its Facebook page.

Several of the likers of the Facebook page vent their disgust at some of the comments made towards the contestants

But the competition was axed by the 
Italian eatery after some of the brides-to-be and their families, some 
of which had terminally ill relatives, received abusive messages on the 
social network.

It is unclear what the abusive messages said as they have now been removed from Facebook.

One of the contestants of the competition, who did not want to be named, told Mailonline: 'The comments weren't on and I'm glad they were removed.

'I don't blame the Tavistock for pulling the competition, there was no need for some of the comments.

'These stupid people have ruined it for everybody else.'

A 
spokesman for the Tavistock Retro said: 'It was with great regret that 
we had to cancel the competition as things quite simply got out of hand.
 We do not condone bullying, and nor can we be seen to promote it.

'It's a great shame that a few individuals spoilt a lovely thing for four couples. But we could not endorse this.'

Up for grabs in the contest was a November wedding package, which included transport, venue hire, a cake, reception and entertainment.

The four short-listed couples had to compete for the prize by posting pictures of themselves on the Facebook page.

Within days of the competition's launch at the start of this month, all couples competing had amassed thousands of likes each.

Several posters, including this one urged the restaurant to reverse their decision to pull the competition

After being pulled, several posters urged the restaurant to reverse their decision.

One post said: 'Can't believe yous cancelled the wedding competition.

'Shame allot of people made a good effort I know you would agree as well.'

But a statement posted on the restaurant's Facebook page, which has also since been removed, read: 'After a lot of deliberation between the management team we regret to inform you all that the wedding competition is going to have to be cancelled.

'This was always the last resort and we honestly are shocked by some of the negative comments and verbal abuse which has been evident.

'We have received many personal 
messages from people accusing us of condoning internet bullying and even
 threatening us with police action.

'As a result, we feel the only option is to cancel the competition.

'This
 competition was intended to be a celebration of our third anniversary. 
It was a gift to the community, for all the amazing support we have had 
over the past three years.

'Unfortunately, we have been shocked that this gift has had to end in this way.

'We are not giving in to 'bullying' by this, we are merely putting an end to it by closing the competition

'We urge you to please refrain from any further personal attacks on either the finalists, or their friends and families.'
