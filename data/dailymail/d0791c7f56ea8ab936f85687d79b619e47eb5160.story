A federal jury in an New York City courtroom awarded a clothing clerk who was tormented and eventually attacked by a co-worker because of his name and race $4.7 million on Friday.

Osama Saleh, 27, a Yemeni man, was a earning minimum wage as a stock clerk at a Pretty Girl clothing store location in Brooklyn, New York, where he was tormented by a security guard.

Saleh claimed that the security guard, James Robinson, not only constantly referred to as 'bin Laden' and told that 'Muslims are dirty and terrorists', but was punched in the face during a September 2007 altercation with the store's security guard, which resulted in him sustaining a fractured cheekbone.

In Saleh's lawsuit, he claimed that nothing was done by the store's manager to stop the bullying from happening. In court documents, store manager Albert Hamra claimed to have thought that Robinson was 'kidding around.'

Front of 441 Knickerbocker Avenue in Brooklyn, New York, as of October 2013, where the Pretty Girl location Osama Saleh worked at once was. The outlines of the 'Pretty Girl' sign can be seen in the photo.

'Being called a terrorist and bin Laden is like an insult and a slur against me and my race,' Saleh told the NY Daily News.

In the September 2007 altercation that left Saleh with a facial fracture, Robinson confronted Saleh 
in the basement of the store after a previous work-related argument on the retail floor.

In the basement, Robinson allegedly told Saleh, 'I'm going to call 
the police on you, telling them that you don't have papers and you are a
 terror [sic],'  further adding that Saleh was 'not an American.'

Saleh, who responded to the threats with 'my father is an American, 
so I'm an American', was then punched in the face and knocked to the floor. Hamra sent Robinson home after the fight.

Robinson, who pleaded guilty to assault in the third degree, did not respond to Saleh's civil action.

In his deposition, Saleh said that the comments made by Robinson were 'serious and mean,' and that he attempted to defend himself by telling Robinson that like he was acting like 'a little kid and that he should act like a grownup.'

Hamra conceded in court that he was heard Robinson refer to Saleh as 'bin Laden' a 'few times', but said that the comments took place in the context of the two 'kidding around' and 'teasing each other.'

Hamra also admitted that Saleh told him on some occasions that he did not like being called 'bin Laden.'

The $4.7 million awarded by the jury to Saleh covered emotional distress, assault, negligence in the 
hiring of Robinson by Pretty Girl, Inc., and punitive damages.

According to Saleh, he still suffers 
hearing problems and difficulty chewing and eating as a result of the hit, for which he had to spend approximately seven days in the hospital. He sustained a fracture to the zygomatic arch in his face.

'That level of disregard is so dangerous in a multicultural society,' Saleh’s lawyer Fred Brewington told the NY Daily News outside of the courtroom.

The judge has set a deadline for the defendants to file a post-trial motion to reduce the verdict amount.

Saleh did not respond when contacted by MailOnline for further comment.
