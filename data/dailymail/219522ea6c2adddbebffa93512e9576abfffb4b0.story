The centerpiece: This uniform once worn by Saddam Hussein is the focal point of the exhibit

An exhibit dedicated to the 10-year anniversary of the capture of former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein will open this week – in Oklahoma City.

The Oklahoma Historical Society came into the items on display after they were donated by the man who led the US Army’s effort to topple the dictator.

Mr Hussein was removed from power in 2003 following a US-led invasion spearheaded by retired Army Lt. Col. and former Oklahoma State Sen. Steve Russell.

The exhibit will feature many of the former despot’s personal possessions, including a European-tailored military uniform worn by a younger Mr Hussein, several firearms and other objects.

‘We’re very excited to have this exhibit,’ Dr. Bob Blackburn, executive director of the Oklahoma Historical Society, said in a statement. ‘It is not every day that such historic items from recent history can be viewed by the public and we are very proud of the ties they have to Oklahoma.’

Those Oklahoma ties are in reference to Mr Russell, who is loaning the collection for a special temporary exhibit.

He helped lead the hunt for Saddam and is also the author of ‘We Got Him!” His personal memoir of the hunt and capture of Saddam.

Baghdad was captured months before the former Iraqi leader was infamously found hiding in an underground bunker

Deadly: Some of the many weapons formerly owned by the dictator

‘For years I have kept low key about these artifacts,’ Mr Russell said in a statement released by the Oklahoma History Center. 

‘I realize that they are an incredible part of our nation’s history that should be enjoyed by the public and hope the display will call to remembrance the soldiers wounded and lost during the hunt and capture of Saddam,’ he added.

The exhibit will go on full display later this month and is open to the public.
