Should FIFA ban Luis Suarez after latest bite storm?

FIFA has launched disciplinary proceedings against Luis Suarez after the striker appeared to bite Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay's 1-0 World Cup win.

The Liverpool striker looked to have sunk his teeth into the shoulder of Azzurri star Chiellini, who attempted to show referee Marco Rodriguez the mark left by Suarez's teeth.

The Mexican official failed to spot the incident but in a statement on their official website, FIFA confirmed that it will investigate the 27-year-old's actions in Natal. The maximum time FIFA are able to ban a player for is two years. Their disciplinary committee will meet at 5pm local time (9pm BST) to discuss the case and video evidence will be used.

Uruguay and Suarez have until 5pm local time (9pm BST) on Wednesday to provide evidence. He could be face a lengthy ban that would keep him out of the last-16 match against Colombia and beyond should Uruguay progress.

FIFA's statement said: 'FIFA can confirm that disciplinary proceedings have been opened against the player Luis Suarez of Uruguay following an apparent breach of article 48 and/or article 57 of the FIFA Disciplinary Code during the World Cup match Italy-Uruguay played on 24 June 2014. The player and/or the Uruguayan FA are invited to provide their position and any documentary evidence they deem relevant until 25 June 2014, 5pm, Brasilia time.

'According to article 77 lit. a of the FIFA Disciplinary Code (FDC), the FIFA Disciplinary Committee is responsible for sanctioning serious infringements which have escaped the match officialsâ€™ attention. Furthermore, according to article 96 of the FDC, any type of proof may be produced (par. 1), in particular are admissible, reports from referees, declarations from the parties and witnesses, material evidence, audio or video recordings (par. 3).'

Senior FIFA official Michel D'Hooghe told BBC Radio 5 Live that the 'serious' case should be brought to a hearing in front of its disciplinary commission and that 'biting is not compatible with normal football practice.'

FIFA's disciplinary code sets a maximum ban of 24 matches or two years, but the longest ban in World Cup history was eight games for Italy's Mauro Tassotti for breaking Spain's Luis Enrique's nose in 1994 with an elbow. Zinedine Zidane was given a three-match ban for headbutting Marco Materazzi in the 2006 final.

Jim Boyce, Britain's FIFA vice-president and head of FIFA's referees committee, expressed concerns about Suarez's actions.

He said: 'I have watched the incident several times on television. There is no doubt Luis Suarez is a fantastic footballer but, once again, his actions have left him open to severe criticism.

'FIFA must investigate the incident seriously and take whatever disciplinary action deemed necessary.'

Incredibly, this is the third time that Suarez has been involved in a biting incident with an opponent.

He
 received a 10-game ban for biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic 
in April 2013. After that incident he tweeted: 'I'm sad for what 
happened this afternoon, I apologize Ivanovic and all football world for
 my inexcusable behaviour. I'm so sorry about it!!'

Those
 words now seem even more hollow, especially as it was the second time 
he had failed to learn from his mistakes after previously receiving a 
seven-game ban for biting PSV's Ottman Bakkal while playing for Ajax in 
November 2010.
