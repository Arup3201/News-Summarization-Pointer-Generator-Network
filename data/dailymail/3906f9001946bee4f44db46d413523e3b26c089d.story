England manager Roy Hodgson says he is working making sure his players are 'comfortable being uncomfortable.'

The Three Lions squad are training at Vale do Lobo in Portugal where they hoped to get some warm weather ahead of the World Cup in Brazil next month.

But it has not been as hot as they had hoped meaning Hodgson and his coaching staff have turned to other methods to get the squad used to the temperatures they can expect at the tournament.

The players are training in extra layers as they try and replicate playing in the heat of South America.

Hodgson
 said: 'The weather is the weather; you never know what you are going to get with weather.

‘The weather is only part of what we wanted here (to Portugal). We wanted the facilities, we wanted to be away from England together in a foreign country.

‘We wanted to come to a country where there is at least a good chance that the sun will shine, because it will shine in Brazil.

‘But we weren’t 100 per cent dependant on that because we were going to prepare the players to be, as the sports science people have termed it, comfortable with the uncomfortable.

‘And that means playing in temperatures that make you feel uncomfortable.

‘But even if the weather got colder here, all we would do is put more clothes on and make them feel uncomfortable that way.

‘Today the players were pretty anxious to take their tops off when they were given permission to do so because they were beginning to sweat a lot and feel uncomfortable.'

 has not suffered any fresh injury setbacks as he prepares the players 
for next Friday's warm-up friendly against Peru at Wembley.

Manchester
 United defender Phil Jones is also recovering well from a shoulder 
injury and the England boss hopes he will be involved before the squad 
return home.

He said: 'The first three days have gone as well as I could possibly have hoped for. But there's a long way to go and three more days to get through but we've made a good start.

'We had a slightly unfortunate incident with John Stones. He twisted his knee very slightly in training but it's nothing serious.

'He could have trained but we decided to leave him out because it's so early on and we don't want to take any risks.

'It was nice to see Phil Jones joining in the warm-up. He's training very very well and it looks like he might be taking part even before the end of this week.'

Hodgson feels the competition for places in the squad, which will be reduced to a confirmed final 23 before England head to Brazil, has ensured the players take their training especially seriously.But while relaxation is not an option, he insists he is leading a 'happy' camp.

Hodgson added: 'We don't talk about relaxation, or about sessions being light-hearted or serious, we talk about the job that we need to do and we expect that every time the players go onto the training ground that they are 100 per cent following what we think needs to be done.

'If they happen to enjoy it then that's a major bonus but we don't set out to make it enjoyable, we set out to do the work that we think is absolutely necessary if we're to have any success at this World Cup.'

Hodgson made some tough calls before revealing his first selection - his decision to include Southampton teenager Luke Shaw instead of 107-time international left-back Ashley Cole was hotly debated.

He believes that fierce scrap for places on the plane has helped focus his players' minds sharply on the task in hand.

'I think they're excited to be selected and I think everyone realises that my choice was a difficult one,' Hodgson added.

'It wasn't just a case of taking the only players that were there, there were more players than these who could easily have come so I think there was a lot of tension among players before I made my selection as they waited to be chosen.

'So in this camp of course there's a lot of enthusiasm but they're also happy that they are taking part in this incredible adventure and that they're the ones who are going to be leading England over the next few weeks.'

Wayne Rooney, who at the age of 18 broke on to the international scene with four goals at the 2004 European Championships, has failed to impress at the last two World Cups.

Big things are expected from the Manchester United striker in South America, but should he flounder at the tournament then Hodgson insists it will not be 'for the want of trying'.

He said: 'He knows what a good player he is, he knows the eyes, certainly of England, if not the rest of the world, are going to be on him and he'll do everything he can to make certain he brings out his best qualities.

'He spent his week off here in Portugal and he trained during that time. He said to me, 'When you arrive on Monday, I'll meet you there and I want to be 100 percent ready to train from the first day'.

'He's a bit disappointed because I decided to leave him out of the exercise I was doing, which involved a lot of shooting, because I wanted to protect his thigh.

'If it had been up to him, he'd have been in it having as many shots as all the others.'
