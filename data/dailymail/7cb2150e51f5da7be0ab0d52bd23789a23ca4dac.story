Gabriel Agbonlahor has seen his red card from the Manchester United match rescinded by the FA after an appeal by Aston Villa.

The striker was facing a three-match ban but will be available for Villa’s Boxing Day clash at Swansea after a hearing on Tuesday afternoon.

Agbonlahor was sent off for using ‘excessive force’ in a challenge with Ashley Young but the United player later told Brad Guzan he expected the foul to be awarded Villa’s way.

Manager Paul Lambert expressed his pleasure at the outcome, given Agbonlahor’s importance to the team and the absences of Ashley Westwood, Nathan Baker, Philippe Senderos and Kieran Richardson.

'It is great for us,’ Lambert said. 'I said at the time I didn't think it was a red card and everyone's assumption was the same. Ex-referees have come out and said it wasn't.

'So your own common sense told you it wasn't a red card. Gabby is playing really well at the minute so we hoped it would be rescinded.

'We are still without a few - Westy, Nathan, Senderos and Richardson - so we didn't want another one out. Not one of your big players.’
