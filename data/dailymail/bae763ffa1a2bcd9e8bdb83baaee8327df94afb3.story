Drowned: Arianna Alioto, 18, died last week during a training session at Northern Michigan University

An investigation has been launched into how a standout soccer player drowned during a team workout at Northern Michigan University.

Arianna Alioto, who suffered from epilepsy, was with other teammates when she somehow drowned.

Tragically, the last message she put out on her Twitter account read: 'It's crazy how things can change so fast.'

Stunned college friends held a candle-lit vigil on Saturday night at the campus where the 18-year-old freshman lived.

Alioto, from Columbia, Missouri, was taking part in a training session at NMU's Physical Education Instructional Facility on Friday evening.

University officials have not released any details of what caused the drowning, but it is known more than a dozen other teammates were taking part in the session.

According to a report in the Columbia Daily Tribune from 2010 Alioto suffered an epileptic seizure during a match. Her coach said she had forgotten to take her medicine and she was passed fit to play in further games.

It is not known if a seizure was the cause of the drowning.

Alioto, who went by the nickname Anna, was a standout soccer player for her former high school.

She also played on the Carrera Soccer Club Elite team, a Columbia-based team that participated in tournaments in Michigan, Colorado and other states.

The teen was also a member of Missouri's Olympic Development Team.

Retired Rock Bridge soccer coach Marc VanDover called Alioto 'a pretty special kid' who 'probably trained harder than any player that I ever had and just a tremendous talent, and she worked very hard to improve every day.'

The teenâ€™s death has stunned the university campus.

'Arianna was not only a good soccer player, but a wonderful young woman,' NMU soccer coach Matt Granstrand said in a statement. 'We felt honored that she chose to play at Northern Michigan University.

'Our team and our extended team family are in extreme pain. It's hard to grasp that Arianna was with us one moment and gone the next. It just doesn't seem real. Her death is devastating. We will be grieving for her loss for a long time.'

N.M.U. President David Haynes extended condolences on behalf of the school to the Alioto family. Haynes said, 'It's difficult to express the emotions that take place when a university family suffers the loss of a student.

'Not only is the soccer team and athletic department in shock, but so too are Arianna's fellow students, professors and the staff she regularly interacted with. Our deepest sympathies go out to the Alioto family at this time.'
