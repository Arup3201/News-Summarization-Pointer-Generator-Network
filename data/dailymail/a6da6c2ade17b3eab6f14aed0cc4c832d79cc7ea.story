Arrested: 31-year-old English teacher teacher Stevie Glasspool was arrested Thursday after it was revealed that she tried to solicit sex from at least four of her students online

A South Florida teacher was arrested after allegedly soliciting sex from at least four students online.

Stevie Glasspool, 31, used to teach English at Mavericks Charter High School before she was arrested on Thursday for soliciting sex from students ranging in age from 15 to 17.

The teacher's affairs were revealed when the target of one of her solicitations showed inappropriate messages he received from Glasspool to another teacher and she was fired.Â 

She went on to get hired at another 
school, Hollywood Academy of Arts and Science, and worked the first 
four days of the new school year before being arrested by Palm Beach Police.

Broward
County Sheriff's Office says she sent the messages this past April and 
May, and all of her victims attended Mavericks. They believe there may 
be more victims who have not yet come forward.

According
to one of the victims, 17-year-old Chris O'Neill, her messages to him 
on Facebook started off innocent but progressed into something sexual 
quickly.

She
sent him messages saying things like 'You should spend the night' and 
'You will be graded on your performance', even luring him with the 
promise of marijuana.

Victim: Chris O'Neill, a 17-year-old junior at Mavericks Charter School where Glasspool taught, said she sent him inappropriate messages on Facebook last April and May

Proof: Student Chris O'Neill saved one of the messages that Glasspool sent to him on Facebook

'I
don't want you to fall in love with me but I also don't want you to hit
it and quit it either,' she wrote in one of her messages.

She also seemed to get irrationally annoyed when he wouldn't immediately respond to her messages.

'It
would be, "Hi, Hey, Hi, Hi. Why aren't you answering me? Are you mad at
me? What did I say?" It was just pathetic,' Mr O'Neill told NBC South Florida.

At
first O'Neill liked the attention, but when he found out that she 
propositioned a 15-year-old, he knew something was 'not right in her 
head'.

All four of the victims who have come forward so far went to Mavericks Charter School, left. Glasspool was fired from that school in May and went on to work the first four days of the new school year at Hollywood Academy, right, before being arrested

His father Frank O'Neill was equally as shocked.

'It
just disgusted me,' he told CBS Miami. 'It made me sick to my stomach. Who can you 
trust because I always put teachers up there with policemen, 
firefighters, you know - role models.'

The student turned her in and now she is being charged with soliciting a child for unlawful sexual conduct

O'Neill doesn't feel bad about reporting his former teacher.

'This lady is just a whack job,' he said. 'Whatever happens to her, happens to her and I have no remorse for anything.'

As for Mavericks, the school where all four victims are from, they say they conducted a background search and nothing turned up.

Broward County Sheriff's spokesman Detective Ann Suter said Glasspool went from charter school to charter school and since she didn't have a criminal background she never raised any red flags.

'Her background check would show nothing as far as her being fired from different schools and she has no arrest history, of course, so it wouldn't pick that up," Suter told the Sun-Sentinel. 'Now that she's been arrested, it will.'
