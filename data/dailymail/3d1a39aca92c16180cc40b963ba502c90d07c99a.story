Young love can be an awkward and embarrassing affair so one teenager picked a novel way to woo the object of his affections - he decided to record a cover version of a classic love song.

Tom chose to perform Bryan Adams' song Everything I Do, I Do It For You, for his friend Emily.

He then posted the video online and, predictably, it has gone viral.

Love-struck: Tom choose to perform Bryan Adams' song Everything I Do, I Do For You, for his friend Emily

Copy cat:Â  In one scene he leans against a tree 
and plays an electric guitar like Bryan Adams, bobbing his head 
emphatically to the music

Singing over the track, the five-minute video starts with Tom walking through a forest, with his hands in his pockets.

It's clear that Tom has closely 
studied the Bryan Adams original as, just like the singer's video, Tom performs against a forest background.

But unlike Adams who is wearing a blue denim jacket, Tom dons a Hawaiian shirt, beige cargo shorts and white trainers.

As he warbles along to the lyrics, the next shot moves to Tom perching on a green bike as he sings longingly into the camera.

The video ends with a rolling message
 on a black screen which reads: 'Special thanks to Emily for being 
beautiful, Bryan Adams for writing the song, Mike for being camera man.

'Once again Emily, you are beautiful and you are the best thing that's ever happened to me.'

Tom makes clear the depth of his adoration for Emily

But just when it looks like the love-sick 
tribute is over, Tom appears on the screen again.

'Hi Emily, I bet you probably think I am a creep after I gave you the music video and the song and everything,' he says.

'But all I can really do is tell you that I care about you more than words can express and that is why I had to make the video.

Last word: Just when it looks the love-sick tribute is over, Tom appears on the screen again against a backdrop of foliage with his hands in his pocket and speaks to the object of his affection down the lenses of the camera

'I mean you can hate me, do whatever 
you want as long as you know how much I care. How much pain I go through
 to come up with ideas, just to describe it.

'You're pretty much all I care about,
 even just to tell you about this I am making myself feel insane talking
 to a camera but I hope you like the video .'

Then he adds: 'Enjoy it. I enjoyed making it for you.'

The video has already been seen by over 200,000 people and has had over 3,000 likes.

Under the clip, which was posted on YouTube, the text reads:

'Alright, here is the deal, I made this music video for Emily, who you know I love if you watch my vlog.

'This is the full version, every clip is in it.

'I know it sucks, I can't sing very 
well. I gave Emily a copy of this before posting it, she liked it, and 
that is the point. I hope you like it if you view it, I put a lot of 
work in. Credit was given where credit was due.'
