Health and safety: Kirsty Hippolite, 39, has been told she can no longer bake cakes for her daughter Georgia's class bake sale

A girl of 12 was banned from selling homemade cupcakes to her classmates – because her mother does not have a food hygiene certificate.

Teachers at Georgie Hippolite’s school stopped her from bringing in the treats for an end-of-term charity cake sale because they breached ‘health and safety’ regulations.

Her mother Kirsty spent two hours making the 40 confetti and violet cream cupcakes – only to be told they were not fit for human consumption.

Georgie’s tutor Gareth Balch at Cowes Enterprise College in Cowes, Isle of Wight, had called to check if she had the food certificate usually held by catering professionals.

When she said she didn’t, the mother-of-five was told her cakes, which Georgie had previously sold at the school without issue, couldn’t be sold.

The teacher explained Cowes Enterprise College could be sued if a pupil fell ill having eaten a cake from an uncertified source.

And he added other pupils planned to bring in shop-bought slices, cupcakes, and sponges for the end of term sale instead.

However, eager to ensure the cakes did not go to waste, he suggested Georgie still take the cakes in - for the teachers.

Mrs Hippolite, 39, whose husband Paul is a 
landscape gardener, said: 'Georgie came home from school and said they 
were having an end of term cake sale to raise money for charity.

'I love baking and spend several hours a week making cakes and biscuits, so I offered to make some treats for her to take in.

'I spent about two hours baking and icing the cakes but got a phone call from her teacher later that afternoon.

'He was apologetic and sounded as if he felt a bit foolish as he asked if I had a food hygiene certificate.

'He explained Georgie was unable to sell
the cakes unless they had been made by somebody who had the 
qualification because of "health and safety".

'I couldn’t stop myself from laughing as
he told me the school could be sued if a pupil fell ill after eating 
one of my cakes. It’s ridiculous.

'People have been baking cakes at home for sale at fetes and village fayres for years without any issues.

'The teacher said other pupils planned to buy slices, cupcakes, and sponges from a supermarket and take them in to resell.

'My daughters never eat that sort of food because it is often pumped full of artificial preservatives and e-numbers.

'Risk': Mother-of-five Kirsty Hippolite, 39, was told she needed a food hygiene certificate to make cakes for her daughter to bring in to class because the school could be sued if a child fell ill after eating food from an uncertified source

'I would rather make them something 
fresh and natural - even though it’s easier to nip to a shop and spend a
pound on something in there.'

Mrs Hippolite, who lives in Cowes, Isle of Wight, criticised the health and safety regulations.

She added: 'The qualification 
the school was demanding is usually only held by catering professionals -
not mums who enjoy baking as a hobby.

'Health
and safety has gone mad when a mum must have a qualification to prove 
she is "safe" to make cakes for her daughter’s friends.

'However, the teacher did tell me all was not lost and that Georgie could still take the cakes in for the teachers to enjoy.'

The food hygiene certificate requires three hours of self-study time and costs about £15 to complete.

It ensures people working in catering understand the impact of food borne illness and how to prevent contamination.

Regulations: James Stewart, the headteacher of Cowes Enterprise College in the Isle of Wight, said the safety of the school's students was its number one priority

Bill Murphy, head of planning and regulatory services at Isle of Wight Council, said the school had been over-zealous.

He said: 'While it is indeed accurate that generally people preparing food for public consumption must be registered with the Environmental Health department, parents making the occasional cake to sell at a school event do not need to be registered.

'I am sure though that the teacher clearly had the best of intentions for the health and safety of their students.

'The council is very keen to support community events such as school fetes or village fayres and our Environmental Health service is more than happy to provide advice and guidance to organisers to ensure their day goes ahead with no problems.'

Headteacher James Stewart said: 'Our health and safety advisor told us it is good practice to make sure somebody with a food hygiene certificate has made or supervised the preparation of the cakes.

'The safety of our students is of paramount importance so we followed the recommended guidance.

'If somebody fell ill having eaten a cake in a classroom - and we had not done all we could to ensure they had been prepared safely - we would be liable.

'Home baked cakes which were not sold were left in the staff room where staff could leave a donation.'
