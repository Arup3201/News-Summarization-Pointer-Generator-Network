A camera set up in the Australian bush has caught the shocking moment a fox snatches a baby wallaby and attempts to run off with it in its mouth.

Without realising, the predator runs straight into the path of the poor joey's mother, and the hunter becomes the hunted.

The protective wallaby takes off after the fox, giving it a taste of its own medicine, as the pair flash past the screen, in  south-west Victoria.

The footage shows the orange-coloured wild fox pouncing on its victim as it mangles the baby joey in its mouth. 

But within seconds, the fox is seen sprinting off alone while the mother wallaby angrily hops after it not far behind.

The video, titled 'Fox mauls young Wallaby.Mother Wallaby chases fox.Australia' was posted onto YouTube by Michael Moss on Wednesday.

A caption along the video said: ‘My trail camera in late October 2014 caught this dramatic footage.

‘I am the leading Tasmanian Tiger/Big Cats searcher/researcher since 1995 on mainland Australia. The fox was introduced in the late 19th century on mainland Australia and is a pest animal in Australia.

‘This trail camera one of two in the Portland Catchment in far south west Victoria I have located in two sightings hotspots. I visit the cameras every six weeks and last Sunday I visited them and noticed this footage.

'Enjoy! PS There is no remains in this area and I have footage since then on this track of a wallaby and mum like what you can [sic] see on this video footage.'
