She is arguably the most famous girl in the world right now and not since the arrival of Kate Moss has one model made such a mark on the fashion world.

Cara Delevingne has already walked in five London Fashion Week shows, opening for Topshop Unique and closing for Mulberry,
and Saturday saw her walking for Sibling and Issa — then partying with 
Rihanna and fellow model Jourdan Dunn at trendy nightclub The Box.

Despite her packed schedule and hectic lifestyle, Cara still manages to wow on the runway and her flawless beauty has even led influential fashion website Who 
What Wear to say she ‘can do no wrong’. But what's her secret?

Secret weapon: Cara Delevingne has revealed her secret to amazing cheekbones...she has a freeze facial before she hits the runway

The 20-year-old model-of-the-moment has revealed that she gets a little helping hand in achieving flawless skin and those cheekbones.

'My skin gets worse during the shows because of all the travelling, so I prepare at the beginning of the season by having Venus Freeze Face Lift Facials, which zap heat onto your skin.

'You come out with plump skin because it helps to create collagen.

'Dude, it's insane,' the fashion darling said.

The non-invasive treatment, which is also favoured by Lisa Snowdon and Yasmin Le Bon, uses unique technology, which creates magnetic pulsed fields and activates the skin's natural healing response.

That healing response causes new collagen and new elastin fibres to form, generally making the skin look and feel firmer and more youthful.

By enhancing circulation, it also 
helps supply more vitamins, minerals and oxygen to skin cells, enhancing
the overall condition of skin by making it look more fresh and rested.

The £95 treatment takes between 30-60 minutes so is well suited to girls-on-the-go like Cara.
