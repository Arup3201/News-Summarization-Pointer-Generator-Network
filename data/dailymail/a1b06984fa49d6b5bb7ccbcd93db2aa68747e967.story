Cressida Bonas has been spotted buying a Marks & Spencer meal for two for a romantic Valentine's night in for her and Prince Harry

Cressida Bonas has been spotted buying a Marks & Spencers meal for two for a romantic Valentine's night in for her and Prince Harry.

The dance graduate is said to have picked up the bargain meal from the Dine in For Two for £20 range on Friday night before apparently heading back to Kensington Palace.

It is not the first time the pair have enjoyed a low key date.

They have recently been spotted at high street burger chain Byron and were also seen at the Cirque du Soleil production of Quidam at the Royal Albert Hall.

The Sun on Sunday reports that Miss Bonas, 24, went largely unnoticed as she visited the food hall, wearing a dark blue coat, jeans and her long hair loose.

Earlier that day Princes William and Harry had joined the flood relief effort by helping soldiers to lay sandbags in Datchet.

The
 brothers secretly joined members of Harry's Household Cavalry regiment 
to shore up the defences just a stone's throw from the Queen's 
residence, Windsor Castle.

Their
 trip to the front line of the crisis is reportedly the second 
intervention into the flooding crisis by the Royal Family, after the 
monarch apparently criticised the Government's response to the disaster.

According to sources, William and 
Harry had been keen to play a part for some days but did not want to 
publicise their presence for fear of distracting from the crisis facing 
householders.

Earlier today Prince Harry appeared at a special track day for veterans, and met Battle of Britain RAF pilots, Spitfire pilot instructors and viewed a Spitfire in the hangar at Boultbee Flight Academy at Goodwood.

He has created a scholarship to get wounded veterans behind the wheel of an iconic Spitfire.

The
 scheme, inspired by Second World War pilot Douglas Bader, will see the 
strongest candidates move up from a Tiger Mother biplane, to a Harvard, 
to the bespoke craft.

It is the latest project launched under his
 charity, the Endeavour Fund, set up in 2011 with the Duke and Duchess 
of Cambridge to ensure that wounded, injured and sick servicemen and 
women have the chance to rediscover themselves through physical 
challenges.

On Thursday Ms Bonas attended the funeral of her stepfather Christopher Shaw.

Prince Harry’s girlfriend attended the late ex-husband of her mother Lady Mary Gaye Curzon, who died last month, in Hampshire.
