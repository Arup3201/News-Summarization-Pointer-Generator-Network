Being labelled a witch would usually be considered an insult, but an unusual beauty pageant in Japan is attempting to change all that.

The National Beautiful Witches Contest celebrates a new category: women 'over 35 that possess an almost magical beauty untouched by age'.

Housewife Mayumi Nishimura, 39, from Aichi Prefecture, took home the top prize in the Halloween-themed pageant held in Tokyo last week, in the fourth annual event of its kind.

Japanese beauty magazine Bisuto coined the name Beautiful Witch in 2009 to describe fashionable and attractive women over 35 who might feel overshadowed by younger models and the industry's predilection for youth.

The pageant launched soon after. Every year, the magazine holds a nationwide search to find the most spellbinding beautiful witch in the country, report Rocket News 24.

Describing herself as a 'normal housewife', Mayumi, who measures B85-W64-H89, came out ahead of the 19 other finalists and 2,400 applicants, many of whom were professional models.

The judges said she stole the show with her big smile and cheerful disposition.

Nishimura said that to keep in shape, she watches a DVD from the K-pop group Girls’ Generation and dances along at least twice a week, much to her husband’s embarrassment.

The home cook also keeps a balanced diet and stays away from carbs, especially during late-night dinners with her husband, who works unsociable hours.
