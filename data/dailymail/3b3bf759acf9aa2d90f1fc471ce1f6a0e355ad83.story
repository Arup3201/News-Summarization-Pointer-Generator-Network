Argentina's players are now the subject of a FIFA investigation after making a political statement about the Falklands on Saturday night.

The players unfurled a banner which said ‘Las Malvinas Son Argentinas’ (The Falklands are Argentine) before their friendly encounter with Slovenia at the weekend.

That prompted the Football Association to react by ordering England’s players not to respond to any media questions about the Falklands conflict.

Making a statement: Argentina players unfurled a banner claiming the Falklands as theirs during a friendly with Solvenia in La Plata

Don't mention the... England's team have been warned against responding to questions about the Falklands

On Monday, FIFA officials confirmed that the action of the Argentina players is being reviewed by their disciplinary department. Once a statement has been cleared by FIFA’s legal department, a form of punishment is sure to follow. FIFA does not allow political messages during matches.

Meanwhile, Pablo Zabaleta has backed his Argentina and Manchester City team-mate Sergio Aguero to win the Golden Boot in Brazil.

Despite suffering an injury-hit season at City, Aguero still managed 28 goals and Zabaleta believes he will lead the way at the World Cup.

‘When it comes to scoring goals, I don’t think there will be anyone better at the World Cup finals,’ said Zabaleta.

‘When he sees the goal, he never seems to miss.’
