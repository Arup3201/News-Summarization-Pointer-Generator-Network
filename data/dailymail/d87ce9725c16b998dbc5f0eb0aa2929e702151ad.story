Football players are used to being at the centre of a storm over their behaviour.

But now it seems the conduct of one of the pint-sized mascots has provoked some amusement.  

Viewers of the England match against Denmark were shocked when one of the youngsters appeared to flick the V-sign at cameras.

Naughty: The boy, bottom left, was holding Liverpool right-back Glen Johnson's hand as he appeared to make the rude gesture

The boy, who was holding hands with 
Liverpool right-back Glen Johnson, was caught on live television 
repeatedly sticking his two fingers in the air.

Players and officials seemed oblivious to the rude sign made while a camera followed the team as  they emerged from the tunnel at Wembley Stadium for Wednesday's friendly match.

But the incident has caused a Twitter storm after eagle-eyed viewers spotted the gesture.

Fans have taken to the social network to express their incredulity at what they had just seen.

Team mascots are meant to rouse a crowd behind their players and help them strive for victory in the tightest of battles.

But it seems the mascots themselves can prove more entertaining than the team.

Burnley mascot Bertie Bee, right, was sent off after handing a pair glasses to the assistant referee during his team's Championship encounter last year.

Bertie had the crowd in stitches with his cheeky gesture just 15 minutes into top-of-the-table clash against QPR in October.

But referee Simon Hooper failed to see the funny side and sent him to the stands at Turf Moor.

And
 Bertie also felt the long arm of the law if a picture on Twitter, below, is to 
be believed, with crestfallen Bertie siting in one of the cells 
underneath the main stand.

But it all ended well for Bertie as Burnley ran out 2-0 winners.

It is not the first time Bertie has made
 the headlines.

During a match with local rivals Preston, the mascot 
rugby tackled a rogue streaker before celebrating with an impromptu worm
 dance.

And across the Atlantic, an American football team mascot was arrested after starting a snowball fight with opposition supporters and brawling with police during a match.

M Robert Garfield III was cheering on the University of Cincinnati team whilst wearing his cuddly bear costume when the snow fight got out of hand.

Police at the game told him to behave but he refused and shoved an officer, sending them both flying to the ground.

Chris Moore took to the social network to ask: 'Anyone else see the England mascot sticking his fingers up to the camera?'

Richie Firth tweeted: 'This annoys me. Would be ashamed if he were my son.'

ITV said it had not received any complaints about the incident.
