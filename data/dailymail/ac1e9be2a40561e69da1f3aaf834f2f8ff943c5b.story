TV presenter Trinny Woodall has revealed her battle with cocaine addiction – and fears her young daughter may follow in her footsteps.

The fashion guru and socialite, who is now dating Charles Saatchi, told how the drug and alcohol turned her into a ‘fake, lying, thieving, cheating person’.

Speaking at a recent debate on substance abuse, she said both she and former husband Johnny Elichaoff – a financial consultant who turned to prescription drugs – suffered from the ‘disease of addiction’ during their ten-year marriage.

But she now worries that ten-year-old daughter Lyla could follow the same path. ‘It makes me question what I can do for my daughter,’ she said. ‘Her mother and her father both suffer from the disease of addiction. So what are her chances?

‘She could grow up and be perfect. I do believe it’s in her. I see elements in her behaviour that are addictive with things. I want to make sure she is nurtured, a nurtured human being.’

The former What Not To Wear presenter, who has been sober for 23 years, began drinking and taking drugs at 16 after moving from boarding school to a day school in London.

She said she was a shy teenager who was insecure about her looks as she suffered from ‘chronic acne’.

Watched by 70-year-old multi-millionaire art collector Mr Saatchi as she took part in the debate, she said: ‘My parents were still abroad and I lived with a sister who was four years older and she had glamorous friends and I so desperately wanted to fit in.

‘One evening I was presented with cocaine and I wanted to take it.

'I had very long hair and I swept down and split five grams of cocaine on the floor and everybody was p****d off with me but I took it.

‘I thought, “I have got to have some bravado here”. I remember that I suddenly had this confidence and I had lacked it until then enormously.

'It was fun for three or four years. I did it at weekends and my friends did it, it was a right of passage.’

But a few years later it became to be ‘a bit of a problem’.

‘My family thought my personality had changed and I remember sitting at the dining room table and I thought I would cop it,’ she added.

‘I told my parents I took drugs and they were horrified. My father said to me, “Well now you have told me, you can stop” and my brother said, “I don’t think it is going to be that simple”. Miss Woodall described how she ‘stopped for a few weeks’ before starting again. A few months later she overdosed. After waking up in hospital, her mother drove her straight to rehab – but she was thrown out after showing a pornographic film. Soon, her addiction started again.

In her 20s she developed a second addiction, this time to alcohol.

‘I had a bottle of vodka a night and I took cocaine and I started to get into trouble,’ she said.

‘It ended in me losing jobs which I pretended were better than they were and I ended up feeling lonely and isolated.’

At the debate, organised by The Spectator magazine, Miss Woodall spoke against the motion that ‘Addiction Is Not A Disease’.

She claimed ‘it is second nature’ that addiction is a disease. ‘I have a healthy life today by knowing that.’ In an article written for the magazine, Miss Woodall revealed how alcohol and cocaine turned her into a ‘fake, lying, thieving, cheating person’.

She finally took steps to conquer her problems when she was 26, leaving London to spend seven months in a primary care centre and half a year in a half-way house in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset.

She filled the hole left by drink and drugs by throwing herself into her career, and later fulfilled her desire to have a child after 11 rounds of IVF.

Miss Woodall, whose TV show finished in 2008, is now back in the limelight following her relationship with Mr Saatchi following the end of his ten-year marriage to Nigella Lawson this summer.

But she will always be an addict in recovery. ‘It is like a diabetic with insulin,’ she said.

‘If they stop taking it, they will die. And I believe, a day at a time, that if I stop taking the primary drugs that can kill me at some stage my life will progress and I will have a greater chance of not living that life.’
