The NHS safety watchdog is to be given Bank of England-style independence from government to stop ministers ordering cover-ups of care failures.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said new powers would be rushed into law to stop officials from burying 'uncomfortable truths' about failures in the health service.

He said he wanted the Care Quality Commission to act as the nation’s chief whistleblower on health.

In a speech to the Tory party conference in Manchester, Mr Hunt announced he was giving up powers as Health Secretary to intervene what the CQC does. 

It means the CQC will not have to wait for ministers to order an investigation into a hospital or care home and the Health Secretary will not be able to dictate the content of its annual report.

The new posts of Chief Inspector of Hospitals, General Practice and Adult Social Care, will also be enshrined in law.

Mr Hunt said it was a major reform 'that will stop politicians ever attempting to suppress or cover up poor care again'.

'We’ll stamp out bad care wherever we find it - public sector, private sector, hospitals, care homes, surgeries - and never cover it up.'

He added: 'As soon as Parliament returns we will legislate to give the quality watchdog the statutory independence it so badly lacked under Labour. 

'This means never again can Ministers or political advisors lean on them to suppress uncomfortable truths, and never again will care failings be covered-up by managers dancing to their political masters’ tune. 

'We will also put the new Chief Inspector posts in statute, so that patients will always have powerful advocates to speak up for them without fear or favour.

'For the hundreds of families who suffered under a system that put political priorities first, we are determined to end the culture of poodle regulation, cover ups, and closing ranks when whistle-blowers and relatives try to speak up.’

Surgeries: David Cameron said GPs had to open later and at weekends to ensure patients get the care they need

The move came as David Cameron called for GP surgeries to open seven days a week and outside office hours.

The Prime Minister set out plans for the first wave of surgeries which will be open from 8am to 8pm every day, making it easier for patients who struggle to fit in visits with their family and work commitments.

The move is a response to growing concern over the quality of out-of-hours care.

Labour allowed GPs to opt out of responsibility for patients outside office hours and at weekends as part of a botched deal which came into force in 2004.

Since then, private companies have taken over and in many cases have been forced to employ foreign doctors, many of whom have a poor grasp of English.

Mr Cameron told ITV's Daybreak: 'I think it is the right approach to look at this because obviously our accident and emergency departments do a brilliant job but they do have 4million more people going through them than was the case in 2004, a lot of people going to accident and emergency really need a GP rather than accident and emergency, so I think this pilot scheme…is a very good step forward.

'There will be a pilot scheme to start with fully funded, properly funded by the government and then we look to rolling it out across the country.

I think it’s a very good idea and it will also help hardworking people who want to go to see a GP but find it difficult to see a GP when they need to.'

Response: Mr Cameron's announcement comes amid growing concerns over over the quality of out-of-hours care. The Prime Minister wants surgeries to open between 8am and 8pm

Ministers say soaring attendances at 
over-burdened accident and emergency units have been exacerbated by the 
failure of doctors to provide a good service around the clock.

The
 Government is now creating a £50million fund that will be available to 
50 practices across the country which will open next year. Together, 
they are expected to cover half a million patients.

Ministers say the scheme would then be extended across the country.

As well as seven-day-a-week access and evening opening hours, the new surgeries will also try out services to suit modern lifestyles, such as greater use of Skype, email and phone consultations.

They will also offer electronic prescriptions and online booking of appointments, online registration and use the latest technology to enable remote ‘tele-care’ of the elderly and vulnerable.

Ministers say they will take a ‘dim view’ of applications for funding from practices which want to cover the extra opening hours with locum GPs.

‘This is about family doctors finding different ways of working, perhaps with district nurses,’ said a source.

The move will not require a renegotiation of the GP contract, though ministers are already seeking substantial changes to it.

Surgeries will be scored on access by the chief inspector of general practice, using Ofsted-style ratings, and ministers say patients will quickly come to expect access outside office hours and at weekends and ‘vote with their feet’ by switching away from surgeries which don’t adapt.

Mr Cameron said: ‘Millions of people find it hard to get an appointment to see their GP at a time that fits in with their work and family life.

'We want to support GPs to modernise services so they can see patients from 8am to 8pm, seven days a week.

‘We also want greater flexibility, so people can speak to their family doctor on the phone, send them an email or even speak to them on Skype.’

He said the Government was looking at other ways of easing pressures on A&E, including opening more doctors’ surgeries in hospitals. 

Professor Steve Field, chief inspector of general practice, said: ‘This move towards seven-day services is great news for patients, and should be embraced by GPs.’

Dr Charles Alessi, chairman of the National Association of Primary Care, said: ‘This has the potential to be the most exciting development in primary care in the past decade.’

Earlier this year, it emerged that doctors were being paid £1,350 a shift to work  for Britain’s biggest out-of-hours care provider, Harmoni, because managers were so desperate to cover evenings  and weekends.

Dr Clare Gerada, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ‘We welcome the announcement of £50million as a small first step towards redressing the massive under-investment that general practice has seen in recent years.’
