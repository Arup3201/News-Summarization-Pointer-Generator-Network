Former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has been pictured enjoying a sunny holiday despite the spate of corruption charges levelled against him earlier this week.

Although he faces 10 years in prison and a £400,000 fine if found guilty of charges that include corruption and 'influence peddling', Sarkozy seemed happy to peddle his way across the picturesque coast of Southern France in his own private Tour de France.

The 59-year-old could be seen with a friend cruising on his bike through the windy roads of Cap Negre, where temperatures today reached the early 20s.

Clad in black lycra cycling shorts and a plain white T-shirt, he seemed happy to stop and chat along the way with locals.

Sarkozy this week became the first ex-French president to be detained by police when he was questioned by investigators for 15 hours.

And he has now accused investigators of ‘humiliating’ him after being charged with 'active corruption', 'influence peddling', and 'violating the professional secrecy of an active judicial enquiry'.

He appeared on French television to say ‘the country of human rights and the rule of law (France)’ should not have to put up with left-wing judges who want to scupper his longed-for return to power.

The Paris home Sarkozy shares with his wife was first raided by anti-corruption officers in 2012, within days of him losing that year’s presidential election to the Socialist Francois Hollande.

There has been a steady stream of corruption allegations aimed at Sarkozy ever since, with Sarkozy’s lawyer, Thierry Herzog, and Azibert Gilbert, a judge implicated in the corruption case, also charged.

The former French president also stopped to have photos taken with locals during his cycle

Sarkozy, who was president for five years from 2007, is suspected of having tried to pervert the course of justice through his contacts in the judiciary.

He is said to have offered an attractive job in Monaco to Judge Azibert in return for inside information about the progress of the so-called Bettencourt affair.

This was a case in which Sarkozy was accused of accepting millions in illegal cash from Liliane Bettencourt, the l’Oreal heiress and France’s richest woman, towards his election campaign in 2007.

Investigators also believe Sarkozy was illegally tipped off that his phone was being tapped as part of investigations into another matter, the so-called Gaddafi Affair.

This is said to have involved Sarkozy receiving millions more from the late Colonel Gaddafi – the former Libyan leader. Sarkozy, who was immune from prosecution while in office, insists that he is innocent of any wrong-doing.

Meanwhile, immediate family members have come to his aid with both his mother-in-law and son passionately defending him.

However, his 46-year-old ex-supermodel wife has been noticeably absent, leading to speculation the couple are having problems in their relationship.
