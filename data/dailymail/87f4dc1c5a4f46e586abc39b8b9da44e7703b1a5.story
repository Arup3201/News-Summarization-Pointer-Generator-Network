Daniel Sturridge could be out for up to a month after the extent of his hip problem was revealed by England boss Roy Hodgson.

The Liverpool striker was injured during last Sunday's game against Manchester United and was forced to pull out of the England squad for Friday’s Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley and the friendly in Italy on Tuesday.

The 25-year-old underwent scans with England that revealed a slight tear of a hip flexor muscles.

Sturridge has since returned to Merseyside for intensive rehabilitation with Brendan Rodgers hoping the forward doesn’t face too long a spell on the sidelines having already missed five months of the season through injury.

However, he is now a doubt for their crunch game with Arsenal on April 4.

'I’m a little bit disappointed for Daniel Sturridge, because when he came to us he didn’t really feel that the slight problem he felt was really any problem at all,' said Hodgson.

'When we did the scan and it turned out that there was a problem he was absolutely devastated because he didn’t want to leave us.

'There was no option because he has a slight tear and you can’t play through that.'

Liverpool are already without suspended duo Steven Gerrard and Martin Skrtel for their next Premier League game at Arsenal on Saturday week.
