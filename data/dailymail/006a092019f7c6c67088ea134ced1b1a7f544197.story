Virgil van Dijk insists that defeating Rangers would make a potential Treble taste even sweeter for Celtic this season.

The Glasgow giants will lock horns for the first time in almost three years when they descend on Hampden on January 31 or February 1 for the League Cup semi-final.

It’s the first time the teams will have met since Celtic won 3-0 at Parkhead on 29 April 2012 - with Rangers’ subsequent financial meltdown putting the fixture into cold storage for two-and-a-half seasons.

Ronny Deila’s side will undoubtedly start favourites for the hotly-anticipated clash, with Rangers still off the pace in the Championship race.

And, having helped Celtic to a fifth successive win against Inverness on Saturday, Van Dijk believes defeating the Ibrox club en route to the first showpiece occasion of the season would lend ever greater kudos to the prospect of a domestic clean sweep.

‘Yeah, it would make it more special if we beat Rangers on the way to winning the League Cup,’ the Dutchman said. ‘We want to win the Treble this season. If we beat Rangers, we will be in the final of the first trophy we can win. That’s what we want.

‘The semi-final is going to be an amazing game. I wasn’t really expecting to play games against Rangers when I signed for Celtic. I knew we could always meet them in a cup, but I didn’t think about it a lot.

‘But of course you want to play in that fixture because it is unbelievable, with everything around it.

‘Everyone wants to experience this game - and win it, of course, which is the most important thing. We have a lot of games before that one comes around, though, so we need to focus on them first.’

Despite having been in four knock-out competitions since 2012, the Glasgow giants had been kept apart until Saturday’s live TV draw paired them together, with holders Aberdeen and high-flying Dundee United fighting it out in the other half of the draw.

Celtic boss Deila made no secret of his delight at being handed the prospect of experiencing an Old Firm game in his first season at Parkhead - with a loud cheer from the dressing room on Saturday leaving no one in any doubt as to the feelings of his players.

John Guidetti, Saturday’s match-winner, has already stated that whoever Celtic landed in the draw would be ‘going down’ - a view subsequently endorsed by van Dijk.

‘It means a lot to everyone here,’ said the 23-year-old defender. ‘Winning it is the most important thing - it doesn’t matter how. We will be up for it.

‘We want to win the League Cup. What John said was true, it doesn’t matter who we play in the tournament, we need to win. But of course it makes it more special that we play Rangers. Hopefully it is going to be a great day.’
