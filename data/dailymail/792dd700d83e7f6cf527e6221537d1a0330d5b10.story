The 18-year-old baby-faced Australian who is believed to have fled to the Middle East to join Islamic State was an 'outcast' who was bullied at school, his former classmates say.

The young man - identified as 'Jake' from Melbourne - is a former Craigieburn Secondary College student who converted to Islam in Year 10.

Ulus Shefket, who was in the same year as Jake at school, said he was an outsider.

'He was quiet and barely had any friends. Whenever you tried to joke with him he would react aggressively,' Mr Shefket told Daily Mail Australia.

'He left Craigieburn Secondary College for another school because I think he felt like an outcast there.

Mr Shefket said Jake was bullied by others at the school.

'Verbal bullying, but nothing too serious, things that a normal person would shrug off easily,' he said.

Mr Shefket said Jake converted to Islam in 2012.

'He came to school one day late in year 10 and just told us that he converted to Islam, but when we asked him why he would give us very vague answers,' he said.

'"That's none of your business" and "I think I made the right choice."'

Another former classmate, Josh Green-Mercier, said: 'He always looked depressed and was always looking down.

'He never communicated unless it was to do with culture and beliefs or math, he always listened to our conversations. Mot many people knew him and he never opened himself up.

But Mr Green-Mercier said reports about his links to IS came as a 'surprise'. 

'I didn't think he could join something like that,' he said.

Jake appeared in a photo on Twitter in December holding an assault rifle in front of the Black Standard flag of IS as he sits flanked by two armed extremists.

When the picture first emerged on social media, the youthful fighter was suggested as  British or Australian, while there were unconfirmed comments that the  jihadi's name was Jonathan Edwards.

But Fairfax Media reports Jake, who now goes by the Islamic names Abdur Raheem or Abu Abdullah, was a maths genius from Melbourne who fled  to the Middle East to join Islamic State.

When Jake converted to Islam, he attended a number of mosques where he prayed with worshippers before disappearing.

Worshippers at the Meadow Heights Mosque claimed they recall Jake's family were not impressed over his new religious beliefs at the time, according to Fairfax Media.

A school friend, who wished to remain anonymous, told Fairfax Media Jake 'was not pushed into IS and was not pushed into Islam'.

'People can make their own decisions and this was one of his - he felt that it was right for him. He had done sufficient research to believe it was the right step in life,' the friend said.

'He was obviously a believer in Islam and wanted to fulfil what he believed was his duties to the religion.'

Jake told his family he had a 'journalist' job lined up in Istanbul after communicating online with an American journalist from the BBC. But it has now emerged the reporter was an Islamic State recruiter, according to Fairfax Media.

The revelations come after two teenage brothers were detained at Sydney Airport by counter-terrorism authorities on Friday night.

The two siblings, aged 16 and 17, from south west Sydney were trying to leave Australia to fight in a conflict zone and were reportedly brought home by their mother after being detained.

The pair had reportedly booked flights to an unidentified country in the Middle East and their luggage were searched while matters remain under investigation.

Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said the western Sydney brothers, who were stopped at the airport on Friday night, will be put on to a watch list.

'The authorities will be working really hard with the families,' he told the Seven Network.

'On the advice I've got, the mum and dad had no knowledge of what was going on.'

Mr Dutton said the online 'radicalisation' of Australian youth was a threat to society.

'We take it very, very seriously,' he said,

'It's a warning message to a lot of parents, you work with your kids, understand what they are looking at online.'

Mr Dutton also praised the move by NSW correction authorities to ban terror suspects in maximum security prisons from communicating in Arabic.

'This is a really good move,' he said.

'We need to make sure authorities are on top of any threat.'

Former immigration minister Scott Morrison, commenting on the case of the Melbourne boy 'Jake', said indoctrination was happening in unexpected places.

'It's very hard to make assumptions on who's going to fall prey to the death cult,' he told Sky News.

The government needed every available tool to stop people joining the fight overseas, he said.

Sydney jihadists Mohamed Elomar, Khaled Sharrouf, and teenager Abdullah Elmir - dubbed the Ginger Jihadist - are so far the most high profile Australians to have travelled to the Middle East to fight with Islamic State.

Elmir, a former Condell Park High student, was filmed on the banks of the River Tigris in Iraq last October. The 17-year-old gained notoriety when he declared that ISIS will not stop their murderous campaign 'until the black flag is flying high in every single land' in the YouTube video

While Elomar and Sharrouf have appeared regularly in Islamic State videos. One of which included a beheading of a prisoner.

Convicted terrorist Sharrouf served three years and 11 months in prison over his role in the 2005 Pendennis terror plot. He left Australia illegally last year and is believed to be fighting with ISIS.

Up to 40 Australian women were also known to have travelled to Syria and Iraq to become 'jihadi brides' or work with terrorists.

More than 100 Australians are thought to have travelled overseas to fight in Iraq and Syria.
