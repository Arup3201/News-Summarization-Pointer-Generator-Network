The family of James Brady, the White House press secretary who was wounded during the 1981 assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan, says he has died. Brady was 73.

Brady undertook a personal crusade for gun control after he suffered a devastating head wound outside the Washington Hilton Hotel on March 30, 1981 and confined to a wheelchair for the rest of his life.

A federal law requiring a background check on handgun buyers bears Brady's name and was singed into existence by former President Bill Clinton in 1993.

A family spokesperson said that Brady had suffered a 'series of health issues' following his injury on that March day in 1981.

Although Brady returned to the White House only briefly, he was allowed to keep the title of presidential press secretary and his White House salary until Reagan left office in January 1989.

The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence is named in his honor. The law requires a five-day waiting period and background check on all handgun purchases.

'Jim touched the lives of so many and has been a wonderful husband, father, friend and role model,' his family said in a statement.

'We are enormously proud of Jim's remarkable accomplishments - before he was shot on the fateful day in 1981 while serving at the side of President Ronald Reagan and in the days, months and years that followed.

'Jim Brady's zest for life was apparent to all who knew him, and despite his injuries and the pain he endured every day, he used his humor, wit and charm to bring smiles to others and make the world a better place.'

'Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to the family of former White House Press Secretary James Brady on his passing.  Jim is a legend at the White House for his warmth and professionalism as press secretary for President Reagan; for the strength he brought to bear in recovering from the shooting that nearly killed him 33 years ago; and for turning the events of that terrible afternoon into a remarkable legacy of service through the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.  Since 1993, the law that bears Jim’s name has kept guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals.  An untold number of people are alive today who otherwise wouldn’t be, thanks to Jim.'

'Every day, reporters and White House staffers walk past a plaque marking the day in 2000 that the White House Briefing Room was renamed the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room.  It reads, “May his courage and dedication continue to inspire all who work in this room and beyond.”  Those words will endure, as will his legacy.  Our thoughts and prayers are with Jim’s wife Sarah, who has been Jim’s steadfast partner in advocacy, and their children Scott and Melissa.'

Brady suffered a bullet wound to his head outside the Washington Hilton Hotel on March 30, 1981.

Although he returned to the White House only briefly, he was allowed to keep the title of presidential press secretary and his White House salary until Reagan left office in January 1989.

Nancy Reagan posted a statement on the death of James Brady on Monday afternoon.

The former First Lady said: 'I was deeply saddened to learn of Jim Brady's passing today.

'Thinking of him brings back so many memories - happy and sad - of a time in all our lives when we learned what it means to 'play the head we're dealt with.'

She went on to say that in the 'short time he was able to serve as White House Press Secretary, Jim brough sharp instincts, integrity to one of the most demanding jobs in Washington.'

Brady, who spent much of the rest of his life in a wheelchair, died at a retirement community in Alexandria, Virginia where he lived with his wife.

A federal law requiring a background check on handgun buyers bears his name, as is the White House press briefing room.

'He is somebody who I think really revolutionized this job,' said Josh Earnest, President Barack Obama's press secretary.

'And even after he was wounded in that attack on the president, was somebody who showed his patriotism and commitment to the country by being very outspoken on an issue that was important to him and that he felt very strongly about.

Brady 'leaves the kind of legacy ... that certainly this press secretary and all future press secretaries will aspire to live up to,' Earnest said.

Of the four people stuck by gunfire on March 30, 1981, Brady was the most seriously wounded. A news clip of the shooting, replayed often on television, showed Brady sprawled on the ground as Secret Service agents hustled the wounded president into his limousine.

Reagan was shot in one lung while a policeman and a Secret Service agent suffered lesser wounds.

Brady never regained full health. The shooting caused brain damage, partial paralysis, short-term memory impairment, slurred speech and constant pain.

The TV replays of the shooting did take a toll on Brady, however. He told The Associated Press years later that he relived the moment each time he saw it: 'I want to take every bit of (that) film ... and put them in a cement incinerator, slosh them with gasoline and throw a lighted cigarette in.'

With remarkable courage, he endured a series of brain operations in the years after the shooting.

On November 28, 1995, while he was in an oral surgeon's office, Brady's heart stopped beating and he was taken to a hospital. His wife, Sarah, credited the oral surgeon and his staff with saving Brady's life.

Brady was a strong Republican from an early age - as a boy of 12 in Centralia, Illinois where he was born on August 29, 1940, he distributed election literature for Dwight D. Eisenhower.

In a long string of political jobs, Brady worked for some well-known bosses: Sen. Everett M. Dirksen of Illinois, Sen. William V. Roth Jr. of Delaware, and John Connally, the former Texas governor who was running for president in 1979.

When Connally dropped out, Brady joined Reagan's campaign as director of public affairs and research. There, his irrepressible wit made him popular with the press, but not necessarily with the Reaganites.

He once ran through the Reagan campaign plane shouting "Killer Trees! Killer Trees!" as the aircraft flew over a forest fire.

It was a jab at his own candidate's claim in a speech that trees cause as much pollution as cars.

Brady remained as transition spokesman after Reagan's election.

But Reagan's advisers appeared hesitant to give him the White House job. Nancy Reagan was said to feel the job required someone younger and better-looking than the 40-year-old, moon-faced, balding Brady.

'I come before you today not as just another pretty face, but out of sheer talent,' Brady told reporters.

A week later, he got the job.

Previously, he had worked in the administrations of presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford: as special assistant to the secretary of Housing and Urban Development, as special assistant to the director of the Office of Management and Budget, and as an assistant to the defense secretary.

He was divorced from the former Sue Beh when, in 1973, he courted Sarah Jane Kemp, the daughter of an FBI agent who was working with him in a congressional office.

Sarah Brady became involved in gun-control efforts in 1985, and later chaired Handgun Control Inc., but Brady took a few more years to join her, and Reagan did not endorse their efforts until 10 years after he was shot.

Reagan's surprise endorsement - he was a longtime National Rifle Association member and opponent of gun control laws - began to turn the tide in Congress.

'They're not going to accuse him of being some bed-wetting liberal, no way can they do that," said Brady, who had become an active lobbyist for the bill.

The Brady law required a five-day wait and background check before a handgun could be sold. In November 1993, as President Bill Clinton signed the bill into law, Brady said:

'Every once in a while you need to wake up and smell the propane. I needed to be hit in the head before I started hitting the bricks.'

Clinton awarded Brady the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1996. In 2000, the press briefing room at the White House was renamed in Brady's honor.

The following year, Handgun Control Inc., was renamed the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence as a tribute to Brady and his wife.

Brady also served as vice chair of the National Organization on Disability and co-chair of the National Head Injury Foundation.

Survivors include his wife, Sarah; a son, Scott; and a daughter, Melissa.
