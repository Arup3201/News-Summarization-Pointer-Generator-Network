Actress Maureen Lipman has abandoned five decades of support for the Labour Party and announced that she would vote for 'almost any other' party at the General Election, partly in protest at Ed Miliband's support for recognising the Palestinian state.

The star of stage and screen gave a dim assessment of the present shadow cabinet, telling the magazine Standpoint: 'The Chuka Harman Burnham Hunt Balls brigade? I can't, in all seriousness, go into a booth and put my mark on any one of them.'

'For the first time in five decades, I shall not be voting Labour.'

Lipman, who is Jewish, reserved her most hostile comments for the Labour leader's decision to back a symbolic Commons vote in favour of recognising the state of Palestine alongside Israel.

She wrote: 'My late husband, Jack Rosenthal, canvassed for Sydney Silverman in the 1945 General Election. "In them days," said the father in his seminal television play Bar Mitzvah Boy, "they handed you your Labour Party membership just after your circumcision." They gave with one hand and took away with the other.'

She said that she had a 'sneaking suspicion' that David Miliband – who was unexpectedly beaten to the leadership by his brother in 2010 – may return strengthened by his time out in the real world'.

'I'm an actress, Ed, and I am often commended for my timing,' she wrote of the Commons vote.

'Frankly, my dear, yours sucks.

'The world is exploding around us. Isis is beheading our civilians while raping and pillaging across Syria and Iraq. Presidents [Vladimir] Putin and [Bashar] Assad are playing such heavy-handed games that we don't know which rebel group to support.

'Hong Kong may be about to see a replay of Tiananmen. Islamist terrorism in every spot on the globe and if one Jew had been responsible for any of those bombings, there would, I am afraid to say, have been another Kristallnacht.

'At this point in our history you choose to back these footling backbenchers in this ludicrous piece of propaganda?'

She went on: 'May I remind you that no one is tunnelling into Dover or sending rockets into Coventry, yet we seem to have every right to bomb the living daylights out of Iraq.

'Again. Conclusion: one law for the Israelis, another law for the rest of the world. Plus ça change.'

Lipman also took a swipe at Mr Miliband's awkward eating of a bacon sandwich in front of the TV cameras during the local and European election campaign in May.

Mr Miliband, who is from a secular Jewish family, had told her he wanted to 'learn more about his religion of his birth' by attending a traditional Shabbat dinner at her home.

'Two days later he was all over the papers, knocking back a bacon sandwich,'she said.

'Now there is nothing intrinsically wrong with a secular Jew chomping on a thinly sliced, pan-fried pig rump — my late husband, before we were married, had been known to queue up for such a thing from the catering van on an early morning film shoot. That was fine with me. His choice. I just couldn't kiss him.

'So, come election day, I shall give my vote to another party. Almost any other party. Until my party is once more led by mensches,' she concluded - using the Yiddish term for 'a person of integrity and honour'.

It seems unlikely the actress would lend her support to Ukip - after the eurosceptic party leader Nigel Farage sought to blame one of her best-known roles for too many young people going to university to study poor quality degrees.

The star's well-known 1980s BT television advert, where she told her grandson that having an 'ology' made him a scientist, meant now there were lots of students 'getting 'ologies', Mr Farage said.

'I blame Maureen Lipman for the whole thing.'
