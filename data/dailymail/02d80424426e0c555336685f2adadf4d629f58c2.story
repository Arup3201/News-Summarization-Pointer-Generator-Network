Tuesday... it's the day of the when workers across the world do a collective groan at the thought that they aren't even halfway through the week. 

But if you're sitting at your desk watching the seconds tick slowly by and wondering if you can get away with pulling a sickie tomorrow, spare a thought for the poor employees on the Please Fire Me website. 

The Tumblr blog features anonymous confessions of disgruntled office workers, fast food employees and shop assistants, who are praying to be fired to take them away form their miserable jobs.
