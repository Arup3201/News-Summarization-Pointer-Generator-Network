This is the dramatic moment a school bus burst into a ball of flames just minutes before the driver was due to pick up children for their first day back.

Miraculously, no-one was injured in the blaze after the quick-thinking female driver pulled over and fled from the empty vehicle when she smelt smoke and saw sparks coming from the underside.

Within three minutes the 51-seater bus was engulfed by a fire which spread to a nearby hedge and melted parts of the guttering of a nearby house.   

This is the dramatic moment a school bus burst into a ball of flames just minutes before the driver was due to pick up children for their first day back

Firefighters battled the blaze - feared caused by an electrical fault - but it completely destroyed the coach which was just a quarter of a mile from picking up 12 pupils.

The youngsters were about to be taken to Crispin School in Street, Somerset when the bus caught fire at Chilton Polden near Bridgwater around 8.15am on Monday.

It is the second time in three months that a bus taking children to the same secondary school has erupted in flames.

The driver had noticed smoke and quickly pulled over when smoke started to pour from the front

Within just three minutes the huge vehicle was completely engulfed in an orange fireball and billowing black smoke

Six pupils were safely evacuated when a coach belonging to a different firm was gutted by an electrical fault in the village of Ashcott, Somerset in October.

The terrifying footage of the blaze was filmed by builder Phil Heyward, 48, after he made sure driver Cara Veater was safe and the bus was empty.

The father-of-two said: 'It was quite dramatic to see. The bus was coming through to pick up children in the villages and I saw it when I was pulling into a property where I was doing work.

'I looked up towards the road and only about 200 metres from me and I saw the driver pull over and I saw smoke and a few cars reversing away from it.

'I headed up towards the bus and by the time I got there - literally within two or three minutes - the driver had got off and it was on fire.

Fire fighters battled to extinguish the blaze which completely destroyed the coach leaving it little more than a burnt out shell (pictured)

The blaze was so strong it consumed the nearby hedge and even melted parts of a house which the bus had pulled up by

It took three fire crews from Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service to finally put out the flames

Luckily no-one was hurt although driver Cara Veater was left shaken up and  frightened by the incident

The fire is thought to have started after an electrical fault in the vehicle's front headlamp 

'Thankfully the bus was empty and she was heading to her first pick up in the village.'

Phil added: 'I believe it was caused by a driver's lamp - the headlight on the drivers side was sparking. It went from there. The whole thing went up within minutes.'

The bus belonged to local firm Aston Coaches and boss Martin Veater said his daughter Cara - a driver for five years - was left 'shaken up and a bit frightened' but unhurt.

He said: 'She was about 500 yards from her first pick up and she smelt smoke.

'She stopped the coach, turned all the heating and that off, and drove another 50 years before she realised there was something not right.

'She stopped the coach and looked underneath and saw sparks behind the front wheel and that was that.

'There's nothing left of the coach. I think it started from the battery area somewhere.'

The blaze was extinguished by three fire crews from Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service and guttering on an empty holiday let cottage was melted.
