There is no hard and fast way into the world of stand-up comedy. Some get into it through touring the club circuit, others start elsewhere in the entertainment industry, others simply aren't funny enough. 

But this Olympics volunteer may have found her true calling as she became an unlikely YouTube sensation thanks to her dry humour while she shepherded crowds towards the Olympic Park ahead of Friday’s opening ceremony.

Thanks to onlookers, who caught the ‘routine’ on tape, more than 330,000 users have watched the unknown volunteer’s hilarious banter, titled 'Happiest Olympic Worker 2012', and it has become one of the UK’s most shared videos on the site.

Entertainer: A volunteer puts an unconventional spin on her stewarding at the opening ceremony

Armed with a megaphone whilst sat atop a chair mounted on a ladder, the steward put her own spin on proceedings three hours before the ceremony’s beginning – treating the lucky spectators of Danny Boyle’s spectacle to an impromptu warm up.

‘It’s here, gates are open, opening ceremony 2012, it all begins. Feel excited,’ she says.

When a solitary voice in the passing crowd whoops, the volunteer says in her sharp, witty response: ‘Yes, thank you. A single lady… one person, but I believe we are all cheering on the inside.’

She goes on: ‘My mouth is dry, I need some water but I am still talking because I am that happy I am going to overcome it.

Crowds begin to gather to watch the amateur comedian

The volunteer even thanks police officers for their services at the Olympics

‘That is my dedication I have for the role. Mouth dry but still talking, still happy, still excited. Yes I can’t contain my excitement everybody, today is a special day.’

As bystanders tune in to the amateur comedian’s monotone musings, she seems to be spurred on, and jokes about the experience she expects to have of the Games.

She quips: ‘We are going to be telling our children’s children’s children about this day. “I was a part of the Olympics, I worked for the Olympics”.

Missing out? The woman joked that she would only be able to hear the Games from outside

But at least she could take in the spectacular sites of the stadium's exterior

‘Some of you will say, “I watched the Olympics.”

‘I’ll say, “I listened to the Olympics from outside and I heard a bit. It was faint but I still heard it. I heard them having fun and celebrating and I felt happy inside, I felt a warmth in my heart and I carried on”’

Playing to the cameras, the volunteer decides to pay tribute to her mother, much like she’s accepting an award.

She says: ‘Hi mum, I love you. Thank you for making me who I am today.’

At one point in the video, one of the onlookers even says, ‘she should do stand-up’, and after one of her witty remarks, the volunteer even says: ‘I’m here until 2am’.
