The decisive moments of the 2015 Tour de France will take place at Alpe d’Huez after the route of the 102nd edition of the race was unveiled in Paris on Wednesday.

The Tour, which begins in Utrecht on July 4, promises to be thrilling, with defending champion Vincenzo Nibali, 2013 winner Chris Froome, two-time winner Alberto Contador and Giro d’Italia winner Nairo Quintana all chasing the yellow jersey.

The race concludes in Paris on July 26, after travelling through Holland and Belgium, continuing to commemorate World War One in northern France and then travelling to north western France.

There is a long transfer to the Pyrenees, but the decisive moments will take place in the Alps.

The penultimate stage will conclude with the ascent to Alpe d’Huez, with its fabled 21 hairpin bends, before the ceremonial finish in Paris.

The 101st Tour began in Yorkshire last July, with Froome and Contador among those to crash out during an attritional race which Nibali dominated.

Jean-Christophe Peraud and Thibaut Pinot reached the podium, the first Frenchmen to do so since 1997.

Froome was not in Paris for the team presentation, instead he was sailing in Weymouth with the British Sailing squad on a Team Sky training camp.

And there is no guarantee Froome will ride the Tour, with the possibility he could target May’s Giro d’Italia and August’s Vuelta a Espana instead.

The 29-year-old Kenya-born Briton said on chris-froome.com: “The team and I will have to give it some careful consideration before we make any commitments to which of the grand tours I will compete in.

“I see myself as quite a balanced GC (general classification) rider and the Giro with it’s inclusion of a long TT (time-trial) of 60km and tough uphill finishes will make it a well balanced race which suits me well.

“If I did the Giro I may also be able to get myself back to top shape for the Vuelta and go there with a realistic chance of aiming for the win.

“Next year’s Tour is going to be about the mountains. There’s very little emphasis on time-trialling which means the race will be decided up in the high mountains.

“With six mountaintop finishes it is going to be an aggressive and massively demanding race.”
