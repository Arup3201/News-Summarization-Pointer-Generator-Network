Flamboyant English designer John Galliano lost his job at fashion house Dior two years ago after he was filmed delivering an anti-Semitic outburst.

And although he has started to pick up the pieces professionally, landing a gig working with prestigious label Oscar de la Renta and currying favour once more with Anna Wintour and fashion's elite it seems that not everybody is ready to forgive and forget.

According to a report on Fashionista.com  the Israel Broadcasting Authority (IBA) have banned Moran Mazor, the Israeli entrant in 
next month’s Eurovision Song Contest, from wearing a dress by the 
designer on air.

Disgraced designer John Galliano was filmed praising Adolf Hitler during a drunken rant and accused of  making anti-Semitic remarks during a dispute at a trendy Parisian cafe

It has been reported that John Galliano was 
among several designers invited to create an outfit for the performance before a rep from the IBA sent her agent a memo 
prohibiting them from working with the designer.

The memo claimed that Galliano’s
actions 'preclude' him 'from dressing the Israeli Eurovision 
representative, at a time when racism and anti-Semitism is rampant in 
Europe, even if he had apologized.'

Having publicly forgiven Galliiano his
previous transgression the Anti-Defamation League’s national director 
Abraham H. Foxman doesn’t agree with the IBA’s decision.

He said in a statement to Haaretz that
he is 'outraged and embarrassed that an entity representing Israel 
would reject Mr. Galliano,' adding: 'This is not the lesson that you 
give your children. Rejecting someone who gave a sincere apology is not 
Jewish tradition. We are a people that forgive and this is not the way 
to overcome bigotry.'

In 2012 Englebert Humperdinck (left)scored a total of just 12 in the competition. This year's entrant Bonnie Tyler (right) is hoping to place better when she represents the United Kingdom

In a further twist to the story Galliano's publicist Liz Rosenberg has denied that the designer was ever contacted to create a performance outfit for Israel's Eurovision entrant Moran Mazor. 

Rosenberg told The Telegraph: 'Mr. Galliano was never asked nor was there any communication regarding being asked to design for Israel's contestant for Eurovision contest. Galliano has been hard at work on his sobriety and his efforts to seek forgiveness from those he offended.'
