It has been four days since gunman Ismaaiyl Brinsley opened fire on Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu  as they sat in their patrol car.

Brinsley fled after the shooting and turned his weapon on himself in a nearby subway station.

On Monday, his mother extended her condolences to the dead officers' families and said she was 'deeply sorry' for her son's actions.

Shakuwra Dabre, 54, from Brooklyn said she identified with the families pain because she too had lost a son.

'I am still deeply sorry about what happened at the hands of my son,' she told  the Daily News . 'And please accept my deepest condolences, sincerely.

'As a mother now I hurt for the loss of my son. Just like they're hurting for the loss of their sons.'

Shooter: Ismaaiyl Brinsley opened fire on Officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu as they sat in their patrol car

Threatening post: While he was travelling to New York, Brinsley posted this threat to police on Istangram

Dabre said that her son had struggled with mental illness his entire life but had refused attempts by the family to try and help him.

Brinsley had a long criminal record, and a deep hatred for the police and the government and a history of mental instability that included an attempt to hang himself a year ago. 

Since the shooting, a makeshift shrine of bouquets, lit candles and toys has been created in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of the city where officers Ramos and Liu were shot.  

Officers at the memorial fell silent to honor them, as city leaders urged people around New York and the country to do the same.

Yesterday, Mayor Bill de Blasio and his wife, visited the site and laid flowers in a show of unity with the police force, which, have, in part said the mayor turned against them before the deaths.

Guest: Mayor Bill de Blasio - who has faced criticism from some officers - came to the memorial with his wife Chirlane McCray. The pair laid flowers and later led a moment of silence

De Blasio also led city officials in a moment of silence at 2.47pm - the exact time Brinsley opened fire on the officers.

Eric Garner's daughter has also expressed her condolences to the families of the two fallen NYPD officers on a visit to their memorial on Monday.

Emerald Snipes, 22, laid a wreath at the site in Bedford-Stuyvesant where a gunman killed Officers Rafael Ramos and Weinjen Liu.

'I just had to come out and let their family know that we stand with them, and I’m going to send my prayers and condolences to all the families who are suffering through this tragedy,' Snipes said.

However, Ramos' family said they are still frustrated by the divisions between the public and police but that they don't fault Mayor Bill de Blasio for the deaths of their loved one. 

Officer Ramos will be laid to rest at a funeral on December 27 in Queens. Meanwhile, arrangements for Liu's funeral will take place after relatives have been flown in from China.

Paying respects: At the memorial in Brooklyn, officers bowed their heads and paused as well
