Forget Gangam Style. With everyone from retired grannies to the Norwegian army getting in on the act the Harlem Shake is the internet's newest dance phenomenon.

And now swimwear giant Speedo is tapping into the trend with a hilarious clip that sees models take to the pool - clad in Speedos naturally - to shake their booty Harlem style.

Shot behind the scenes at the swimwear brand's latest campaign shoot, the video shows a snorkel wielding model take to the pool watched by the crew on the edge of the pool.

Dance party: Seconds later, the whole cast and crew join in, with the exception of the underwater camera man

Soon joined by the rest of the cast and 
an intrepid underwater camera man, the water is left frothing - and the 
crew very wet - as a result of the wildly shaking posse of models.

The Harlem Shake song was originally released in May 2012, but the online phenomenon 
was born on January 30th, when one video blogger posted a video 
of himself and three others dressed in colourful latex suits dancing to 
the song.

Created by Harry Rodrigues, aka DJ Baauer, video tributes to the song have collectively generated 175million views 
to date.

The 23-year-old, who was born in West Philadelphia but is based in New York, said in a Q & A with Reddit users: 'The viral craze was something totally out of my control.
 I see it really positively.'

In an interview with The Daily Beast, he elaborated further: 'All I did was make the song so it’s kind of a weird place for me 
to be at,' he said. 'I birthed it, it was raised by others, and now it’s like my 
weird, f***ed up adopted teenage kid coming back to me.'

its own, with video tributes collectively generating 175million views

Is this the new Gagnam Style? In a new video craze, one person - in this
 case Supermodel Jourdan Dunn - is seen dancing unnoticed to Harlem 
Shake

Dunn and Rosie Tapner whip their hair to the catchy tune

Baauer, who at one point lived in Harlem, says the name of the track is not intended to be a tribute to the dance of the same name, nor his time in the Uptown neighborhood.

Instead, he explained, it references a line in Plastic Little’s Miller Time, 'then do the Harlem Shake', which Baauer's track samples.

'It just got stuck in my head for a while, so I used it,' he said.

Since then, thousands of people of all ages and walks of life have created their own versions of the popular meme.

Of his favourite Harlem Shake 
tributes, Baauer told Reddit that 'the underwater one is pretty great,' 
and also mentioned the T-Pain version as another of his top takes on the
 track.

One that was less well-received was one by rapper
 Azealia Banks, who released - and then forced to retract - a remix of 
Harlem Shake without the permission of his label, Mad Decent.

AttenSHUN!: A group of Norwegian soldiers line up in a neat square formation

Seconds later, the soldiers - who are suddenly wearing skis and standing on their heads - do the crazy dance

Unlike 2012's Gangnam Style internet 
dance craze, the Harlem Shake does not 
involve any specific 
dance moves and is instead more of a free-for-all, often leading
 to hilarious results.

In one video, a troop of Norwegian soldiers is seen lining up in formation.

One
 of the soldiers begins dancing, and 20 seconds into the video the other
 soldiers - who are suddenly wearing skis, standing on their heads or 
wrapped up in sleeping bags on the ground - join in on the dance.

Another
 video sees the crew and animals of San Antonio Sea World, all bopping 
their heads and shaking their fins to the beat of the tune.

Many sports teams have also put out their own versions of the meme.

In
 a unique take on the video, the University of Georgia's swim team took 
their camera under water to film their dance routine.

The video sees the team sitting around a table at the bottom of a swimming pool.

One swimmer wearing a Star Wars storm trooper helmet begins to dance, and then a group of his teammates suddenly joins in.

Party time: Members of the community look bored, before breaking into the Harlem Shake

At Clark Retirement Community, senior citizens bravely attempted their own adaptation of the dance.

A video shows members of the community looking bored in the lobby, before they break out in a frenzy of smiles and dance moves.

Celebrities have also tried their hand at the dance.

Backstage at London Fashion Week, models Cara Delevingne and Jourdan Dunn whip their hair to the catchy tune.

And T-Pain posted his own take on the meme.

In his video, which appears to take place in a game room in the rapper's home, T-Pain starts out by hula-hooping to the beat of the song.

But
 when the beat comes in, a dancing crowd appears in the room, and the 
rapper - suddenly wearing a marching band outfit - busts a move in the center of the group.

Even the Sports Illustrated swimsuit models have produced their own version of the dance.

In the video, blonde bombshell Kate Upton takes the lead as the girls bust a move under a Las Vegas sign.

Baauer, who is set to perform at a 
number of U.S. festivals this summer, thanks to his success, says he is 
appreciative of the recognition he has received in the videos.

He wrote on Reddit: 'At the end of 
the day lots of new people are listening to my music,' he wrote. 'I'm 
hoping that my music will speak for itself.'
