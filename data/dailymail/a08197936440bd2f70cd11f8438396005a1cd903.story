Federal police were watching over murdered student Jamie Gao for a staggering three years before his death, it has emerged.

Friends' claims that he was just a social and naturally smart pupil have been shattered by revelations that he has long been a suspected drug importer.

Suggesting that he was far from simply a straight-A student at the University of Technology Sydney, federal officers have provided a 20-page document about his dealings to NSW authorities, who say Mr Gao had been a 'person of interest' since as far back as 2011.

Police say that on the day of his murder the 20-year-old was carrying 3kg worth of methamphetamine.

Watched: Federal police were reportedly monitoring Jamie Gao for three years before his death

'He was not some lowly delivery boy,' one senior detective told The Daily Telegraph.

'No syndicate is going to trust some underling with 3kg of gear and you don't get trusted with that much for your first deal.'

It is believed Mr Gao was caught up in a Hong Kong-based Asian organised crime group, at the same time as living an active social life and being loved-up with his new girlfriend.

He still lived at home with his mother Catherin Sui Ying Gao and grandmother in a $1.5 million house in Hurstville.

Police have alleged that before he was killed on Tuesday May 20, he got inside a car with  former detectives Glen McNamara and Roger Rogerson and was driven to a storage unit nearby.

Police claim Mr Gao was killed for his bag's contents just before 2.30pm.

CCTV footage showed Mr Gao last getting out of his car holding a large bag in Padstow.

Friends of the murdered 20-year-old say 'his intention was not to be bad' and he was swayed by peer pressure

Earlier this week, MailOnline revealed details of an incident in January where Mr Gao abducted and bashed a teenager  on behalf of a scorned friend in a terrifying 90-minute ordeal.

Jaiwei Yu, 19, said he was kidnapped, taken to a park and bashed in the head and chest by Mr Gao and two accomplices.

Mr Gao had been called in as an enforcer to 'get revenge' on 18-year-old Alex Li on behalf of a female friend, who had been dumped by the victim's flatmate, the intended target of the assault.

But when Mr Gao arrived at the flat at Carlton in Sydney's south on January 9, Mr Li was not at home – so he abducted Mr Yu instead.

Detained after dark: It was to this park, Tindale Reserve, in southern Sydney where Jamie Gao and two teenage accomplices took 19-year-old Jiawei Yu after kidnapping and beating him and driving him around in his car on the night of Thursday January 9 as part of a revenge attempt gone wrong

'It was because Alex and his girlfriend' broke up,' Mr Yu told MailOnline at his home in Sydney's southern suburbs.

'[She] wanted revenge on Alex. She used Jamie to do it ... to come around and kidnap me.'

During the terrifying 90-minute ordeal Mr Yu was driven around nearby suburbs, taken to Tindale Reserve, a local park, and bashed around the head and chest by Mr Gao, who he had never previously met.

'They drove around, through the park and they beat him up with fists in the head,' Mr Li said.

Meanwhile Mr Li, the intended target, was staying at a house just one street away when Mr Gao arrived sometime after 10pm.

'They think I am with Jaiwei. We are friends,' Mr Li said.

'They thought I would be at his house. I'm not at home and they thought he might be here.'

Police interviewed Mr Yu at his home in February and on March 22 charged Mr Gao with taking and detaining Mr Yu in company with intent to get advantage and occasioning actual bodily harm.

Mr Gao was also charged with conspiring with the two teenagers to assault Alex Li and cause him actual bodily harm.

The girl and the third friend, who were minors at the time, will face Sutherland Children's Court on July 1 on charges relating to the kidnap and assault.

Meanwhile, a 19-year-old friend of Mr Gao's, who had lunch with him the day before he was murdered, told MailOnline his involvement in a drug deal seemed completely out of character, describing him as a 'nice guy' who was swayed by peer pressure.

'People say he's dealing drugs and he's bad. But his intention is not to be bad,' she said.

'He doesn't do anything on purpose to hurt anyone, I think he was just persuaded by his friends and by peer pressure.'

'He doesn't tell us about all the stuff he does,' she said.

'He does tell us about his private life, family and girlfriend but not about the illegal stuff.'

The day before his murder was reportedly as normal for Mr Gao as any other. He went to his morning university classes before stopping for lunch at a nearby cafe with a uni friend.

At no stage, his friend told MailOnline, did he seem nervous or on edge. Nor did he mention his plans for the following day. Instead he spent his time gushing about his new girlfriend - a young woman he'd had a crush on for some time and had been dating for just 'a couple of months'.

Pictures posted to Mr Gao's girlfriend's Facebook page show the couple hugging and kissing.

Mr Gao's girlfriend told MailOnline she was struggling to cope with the news. She declined to comment in detail, saying it was a 'very hard time' for her.

On Monday May 19, the UTS business student went to class in the morning and afternoon as normal. During a break between 11am and 1pm he lunched with a friend at Caffe Tiamo on Pitt St in Sydney's CBD.

His female friend, who did not want to be named, said Mr Gao did not talk about his plans for the next day.

'He was fine, normal. we had lunch,' she said. 'He didn't tell me about the meeting.'

Mr Gao's friend told MailOnline that, before the body was formally identified, his girlfriend was still hopeful he'd return, saying she 'still expects him to come back'.

'They've only officially been together a couple of months, but he liked her for a while,' she said.

The friend described Mr Gao as social and naturally smart.

'He wasn't crazy about study, he wasn't the nerdy type that studies every day, he was more social,' she said.

Mr Gao's body was found floating off Sydney's Shelly Beach, near Cronulla, wrapped in a blue tarp on Monday morning.

The discovery triggered a nation-wide manhunt for Rogerson, which ended in his arrest in a blaze of publicity at his Sydney home.

McNamara, a former police colleague of Rogerson's, was charged with Mr Gao's murder on Sunday night.
