West Ham boss Sam Allardyce has confirmed Mauro Zarate is set to complete a loan move to QPR after the forward hit out at his lack of opportunities at Upton Park.

The 27-year-old joined the Hammers in the summer from Velez Sarsfield but has made just eight first-team appearances since - with his last start coming against West Brom on December 2.

Zarate was the first of nine signings made by West Ham during the summer transfer window but, with fellow forward recruits Enner Valencia and Diafra Sakho hitting the ground running and Stewart Downing enjoying a renaissance in a No 10 role, the former Birmingham loanee has struggled for a sustained run in the side.

And he voiced his displeasure on Monday as a move across London to relegation candidates QPR moved closer - citing the fact he was brought in by co-chairman David Sullivan rather than Allardyce as the reason behind his lack of chances.

'I respect the other strikers at the club who have done a good job,' Zarate was quoted as saying.

'But I believe my record entitles me to respect and I have not had that from the manager. The chairman has confidence in me. I know this because he brought me to the club.

'But for this reason the manager has refused to play me. He did not want me. I made it clear many weeks ago that I wanted to leave.'

When asked at his pre-match press conference ahead of his side's New Year's Day clash with West Brom, Allardyce revealed Zarate was undergoing a medical at QPR. 

Allardyce also stated that he expected the forward to join Harry Redknapp's side on loan for the remainder of the season when the transfer window opens.
