Philips' SlimStyle light bulb, pictured, promises a comparable brightness to a 60W bulb instantly

Fumbling around in the dark to replace a lightbulb could soon become a thing of the past – or at least a task you only have to carry out every quarter of a century or so.

A new flat lightbulb, the world’s first of its kind to go on sale, has been launched by Philips.

The company promises its SlimStyle LED bulb is more efficient, less likely to break than other bulbs and will last for 23 years.

The bulb has a round shape to the front but is flat when viewed from the side so it is less three-dimensional than we’re used to.

It is covered in rubber and has LED lights arranged in a horseshoe shape on the inside.

The Dutch electronics manufacturer said it lasts 25 times longer than a traditional 60W incandescent bulb but has a similar output.

And unlike some other energy-saving bulbs, it lights up instantly.

Existing LED bulbs last for around 10,000 hours, while a halogen lightbulb lasts 1,000 hours.

But Philips said the new bulb should last 25,000 hours, which will mean nearly 23 years of use if lit for an average of just under three hours a day.

It is claimed that each bulb reduces energy consumption by 85 per cent, bringing electricity savings of £80 over its lifetime.

The company said the improvement to energy-efficient lightbulbs – which are often criticised for being more expensive and duller than classic filament bulbs – is down to advances in LED technology.

The SlimStyle lightbulb went on sale this week in the US for $10 (£6) and will be made available in Britain if sales are successful.

Mike Simpson, technical and design director at Philips UK, said: ‘The new design is expected to make LED lighting more cost-effective for the householder.’

The SlimStyle lamp, pictured, has a lifespan of 25,000 hours, according to Phillips, while a halogen light bulb lasts on average 1,000 hours. The LED light bulb is set to go on sale this month in the U.S. for less than $10 (£6) and come over to the UK if sales are successful
