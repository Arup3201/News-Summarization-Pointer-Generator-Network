Masked militia stormed a university in Caracas hurling stones and fireworks as tensions mount over Venezuela's crippled economy.

Pro-government students at the Central University of Venezuela battered their anti-establishment peers with sticks, hospitalising three.

Hundreds of riot police deployed tear gas and grenades to bring the hours-long conflict under control.

Pro-government students attacked their anti-establishment peers with sticks during a riot in the Central University of Venezuela in Caracas on Thursday

Prepared for violent action, student came clad in goggles, faces mask and hats, with many brandishing catapults to throw stones at police officers and rivals

The outburst on Thursday started as a march through the capital calling for an end to rocketing inflation and dwindling resources.

But within minutes, bandana-clad fundamentalists started throwing rocks at police officers and the scene descended into near-anarchy.

Student leader Juan Requesens says at least three protesters were hospitalised with serious injuries.

The militia members prevented journalists from photographing a student who lay on the ground, apparently gravely injured.

The students captured two counter-protesters and stripped them naked.

The protest was the latest in two months of unrest in the country, which has left at least 35 people dead.

Demonstrators have been on the streets since early February calling for Nicolas Maduro's resignation and complaining about a litany of problems from rampant crime to food shortages.

The government says they are seeking a coup against Maduro.
