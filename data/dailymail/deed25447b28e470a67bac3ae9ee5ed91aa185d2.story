UEFA launched its new Nations League this week, promising to shake up the international calendar and replace pointless friendlies with meaningful competition.

The inaugural tournament will take place in 2018 and 2019, helpfully filling the gap between the World Cup and European Championship.

But what is the Nations League and how will it work? We answer all the key questions for you.

England will be one of the 54 UEFA countries to take part in the Nations League, to be launched in 2018

How has this Nations League come about?

UEFA and its members have long wanted to find a way of spicing up those largely meaningless friendlies that fill the international calendar.

You only have to look at pictures of a half-empty Wembley for their September friendly with Norway to understand why England and other countries are in favour of introducing more competitive matches that generate more interest and shift tickets.

This idea has been on the agenda at UEFA committee meetings since 2011 and, on Thursday, UEFA finally unveiled the finer details of the new Nations League.

So what's the format?

The Nations League will be comprised of four Divisions (A-D). Each of these is then sub-divided into four groups of either three or four teams (numbered 1-4).

UEFA's 54 nations will be split between the four divisions, according to their position in the rankings as they stand in November 2017.

Division A will include the top-ranked European nations, like Germany, Spain, England, France and Italy. Division D will contain the minnows like San Marino, Luxembourg and Gibraltar.

Divisions A and B will consist of four groups of three teams. Division C will comprise two groups of three teams and two groups of four teams. Division D will feature four groups of four teams.

The nations in each group then play each other home and away across the double-header international weeks in September, October and November 2018.

World champions Germany will be one of the favourites for the Nations League when it launches 

The teams that finish top of the four groups within Division A - the top one - then progress to a Final Four competition to be staged in June 2019.

They will play in a knockout format with semi-finals and then a final at neutral venues to determine the UEFA Nations League champions.

There is also promotion and relegation between each of the Divisions with four teams moving in each direction for the next running of the competition.

How does this affect Euro 2020 qualifying?

UEFA claim the new system will make the European Championship qualifying more streamlined.

The qualifying tournament will take place as usual but will take less time, being held between March and November 2019.

The winners and runners-up from the 10 qualifying groups advance automatically to the finals as is the case now.

The remaining four places at the finals will come from Nations League play-offs. Within each of the four divisions, the four group winners will advance into the play-offs, to be played in March 2020.

They will then play semi-finals and a final to determine which four nations reach the tournament.

If the group winners have already booked their place at Euro 2020, their place will be allocated to the next best ranked team in their particular division.

So this is a fall-back for nations who haven't reached Euro 2020 via the usual qualifying route.

What are the advantages?

The main beneficiaries of the change will be Europe's smaller nations. Those minnows placed in Division D will have an equal chance to reach Euro 2020 because of the play-off system, which is designed so they're drawn against a nation of similar ability rather than a big gun.

For the fans, it means a big increase in the amount of competitive football on offer and more attractive fixtures to go and watch.

Won't it mean a more crowded calendar?

No, it shouldn't do. The international weeks will remain at roughly the same time of year as they are now.

UEFA even say the demands on players will be less because the games will all be in Europe, meaning shorter flight times.

Is this the end of friendly matches?

No, there will still be room in the calendar for friendly games against nations from outside of Europe.

The new competition offers hope that minnows like Gibraltar can qualify for the European Championships

Talk me through this then...

Ok, let's take England. Now as one of Europe's foremost nations, they will be drawn in Division A with the other top-ranked countries.

Let's say they're drawn with Holland and Russia in one of the three-team groups.

So between September and November 2018, England will play both of them home and away, meaning four matches in total.

England beat Holland and Russia at Wembley and draw both their away matches, meaning they finish in first place.

This means they advance to the Nations League Final four and have a semi-final with, say, Germany in June 2019. It will be held at a neutral venue determined by UEFA.

If they win, they'll make the final, again on neutral territory. Lose, and they're out.

At the same time, England will be playing through their Euro 2020 qualifying group as is the case now. This will take place between March and November 2019.

If England finish first or second, they qualify for Euro 2020 automatically.

But say they have a bit of a disaster and only finish third in their group. Their performance in the Nations League could save them.

Because they beat Holland and Russia to finish first, they'll advance to the play-offs in March 2020.

There, they will face the next highest-ranked nation who have not already secured their place at Euro 2020 in a play-off semi-final.

Win that and then the final and they will sneak into Euro 2020 as one of four teams who have qualified through the Nations League play-off route.
