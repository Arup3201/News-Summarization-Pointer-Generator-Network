It's been more than a year since experts announced the remains found in a car park in Leicester were those of King Richard III - but now experts have raised serious concerns about the findings.

Michael Hicks, from Winchester University, and archaeologist Martin Biddle, from the Winchester Research Unit, are challenging the results of the DNA testing, and the accuracy of the radiocarbon dating.

They are even calling for a coroner's court to be set up to independently review all of the evidence.

The University of Leicester concluded the remains, pictured, belonged to the king during a press conference in February last year. Experts from Winchester University are now challenging these findings including the results of the DNA testing and the accuracy of the radiocarbon dating

The remains believed to belong to King Richard III, painting pictured, were uncovered by archaeologists at former church in Leicester in 2012

The University of Leicester concluded the remains belonged to the king during a press conference in February last year, after the body was excavated in September 2012.

They claimed DNA samples matched that of a descendant of the king's maternal line, while the skeleton's spinal curvature also matched accounts of the humpback royal.

The team used radiocarbon dating to determine when the skeleton died, and said this confirmed it was around the same time the king was killed during the Battle of Boswroth in 1485.

Speaking to BBC History Magazine, 
Professor Hicks argued the remains could belong to a victim of any of the
 battles fought during the Wars of the Roses: 'Lots of other people who 
suffered similar wounds could have been buried in the choir of the 
church where the bones were found,' he explained.

He
 also queried the project's use of radiocarbon dating, which dates the 
bones to the period of Richard’s death: 'Such a technique is imprecise. 
It will give you an era, but nothing more.

'In this case, it covers a period of 80 years.'

Professor Hicks went on to question the prominence given to DNA testing in claims about the identity of the remains, too, adding: 'The DNA match could equally be the result of the bones being those of someone descended in the female line from Richard’s mother, Cecily Neville.'

King Richard’s grandmother, Joan Beaufort, for example, had 16 children, 'which made her the ancestor of much of the nobility of the Wars of the Roses - quite a few of whom died violently in those conflicts,' continued Professor Hicks.

'Indeed, it is very hard to prove 
that the skeleton belongs to a specific person. The Leicester team 
themselves acknowledge that it’s extremely rare for archaeologists to 
find a known individual, let alone a king.'

The University of Leicester concluded
 the remains belonged to the king during a press conference in February 
last year after the body was excavated in September 2012.

The skeleton was described of that of a slender male, in his late 20s or early 30s. Richard was 32 when he died.

Pictures also revealed a 
distinctive curvature of the spine synonymous with the hunchback king. There was, however, no evidence of a withered arm, which was also part of the Richard myth.

While DNA samples matched that of a descendant of the king's maternal
 line.

The 
team used radiocarbon dating to determine when the skeleton died and 
said this confirmed it was around the same time the king was killed 
during the Battle of Bosworth in 1485.

Trauma to the skeleton showed the 
king died after one of two significant wounds to the back of the skull -
 possibly caused by a sword and a halberd.

Experts said this was consistent with contemporary accounts of the monarch being killed after receiving a blow to the head.

The skeleton also showed a number of 
non-fatal injuries to the head and rib and to the pelvis, which is 
believed to have been caused by a wound through the right buttock.

The remains were uncovered by archaeologists at former church in Leicester, which is now a social services car park.

Professor Hicks argued the remains could belong to a victim of any of the
 battles fought during the Wars of the Roses, as 'lots of other people who 
suffered similar wounds could have been buried in the choir of the 
church.'

He
 also queried the project's use of radiocarbon dating, because it covers a wide period of 80 years.

Professor Hicks
added the DNA match could equally match anyone descended in the 
female line from Richard’s mother, Cecily Neville. King
 Richard’s grandmother, Joan Beaufort, for example, had 16 children.

Professor Biddle continued historians know very little about the graves in the east end of the church and is calling for a coroner's court, or similar, to review the evidence.

Professor Biddle echoed these concerns: 'We know very little about the graves in the east end of the church.

'How many burials were made there in the three centuries of the friary’s existence, and indeed after the battle of Bosworth?

'Without further excavation there is 
no certainty. Before all this goes any further, it would be wise to be 
certain the body really is his.

'Something akin to a coroner’s court 
should be set up to consider all the evidence.'

Two vertebrae of the skeleton, believed to belong to King Richard III, were found to show abnormal features relating to scoliosis, or curvature of the spine. Leicester University claimed this find corroborates historical accounts of Richard that described him as a hunchback

In
 response to the claims Philippa Langley, who commissioned and paid for 
the excavation, said: 'To say it cannot be claimed ‘with any confidence’
 that this is Richard is quite puzzling.

'Given
 the totality of the evidence, it can surely be said with considerable 
confidence. Hicks says that there may have been ‘lots of people with 
similar wounds’: perhaps he could name one who fits the bill?'

Richard, depicted by William 
Shakespeare as a monstrous tyrant who murdered two princes in the Tower 
of London, died at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, defeated by an army led
 by Henry Tudor.

According to historical records, his 
body was taken 15 miles to Leicester where it was displayed as proof of 
his death, before being buried in the Franciscan friary.

The team from Leicester University 
set out to trace the site of the old church and its precincts in 2012, including
 the site where Richard was finally laid to rest.

They began excavating the city centre
 location in August and soon discovered the skeleton, which 
was found in good condition with its feet missing in a grave around 27 inches (68cm) below ground level.

It was lying in a rough cut grave with the hands crossed in a manner which indicated they were bound when he was buried.

To the naked eye, it was clear the remains had a badly curved spine and trauma injuries to the rear of the head.

But archaeologists were keen to make no official announcement until the skeleton had been subjected to months of tests.

Meanwhile, a spokesperson from the 
University of Leicester added: 'The strength of the identification is 
that different kinds of evidence all point to the same result. Hicks is 
entitled to his views, but we would challenge and counter them.

Professor Hicks concluded: 'I’m not saying that it’s not Richard - 
it’s perfectly conceivable that it is - but we are not in a position to 
say with any confidence that it’s him.

'Similarly, while the curved spine
 suggests the skeleton is Richard’s, the presence of scoliosis does not 
represent conclusive proof.'
