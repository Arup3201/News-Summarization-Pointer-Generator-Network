It was always an unlikely union – the former socialite daughter of a disgraced Tory minister and a Sikh warrior from the foothills of the Himalayas.

Now the marriage between Alexandra Aitken and her Indian husband Inderjot Singh is said to be in trouble.

Family friends of the Aitkens say the couple have been spending long periods apart and that their relationship is effectively over.

And when questioned on her three-year marriage recently, Alexandra would only say: ‘God is my true love.’

Alexandra is one of three daughters of
 former treasury minister Jonathan Aitken, who was jailed for 18 months 
in 1999 for perjury and perverting the course of justice.

She
 was best known in her twenties for falling out of Mayfair nightclubs in
 revealing dresses and posing naked in GQ magazine. So it was a surprise
 in October 2010 when she married Mr Singh who is a member of the 
Nihangs, a distinguished Sikh warrior order.

Alexandra,
 now 33, had moved to Amritsar in Northern India that year after 
apparently having a dream about a Sikh who would change her life.

She
 noticed law graduate Inderjot while practising yoga at the Golden 
Temple and spent a week beside him without exchanging a single word.

She later said she knew she was ‘blindly in love’ and returned to the city a few weeks later to be introduced to him.

Alexandra
 rapidly adopted Sikh traditions, refusing to cut her hair or even wax 
her eyebrows, using only a wooden comb and carrying a ceremonial knife.

The couple were married on October 28 at a temple in Rayya, a village just outside Amritsar.

Guests
 included her twin sister Victoria but she was sworn to secrecy and her 
parents were not told about the ceremony until later.

When
 news of her marriage broke, Alexandra admitted her father and mother 
were initially ‘shocked’ and ‘upset’. She revealed in an interview: 
‘When I said, “Daddy, I might be wearing a turban next time you see me”,
 it was a bit of a shock.

‘But my father loves my husband – it’s impossible not to. He’s happy for us.’

Alexandra,
 who now uses the name Uttrang Kaur Khalsa, remains a devout follower of
 Sikhism but spent much of this year Italy, away from her husband. She 
is now thought to be back in India.

A
 friend of Alexandra’s twin sister said: ‘Victoria told me that the 
marriage had come to an end, and that they’re living separate lives.

‘But she didn’t know much more as she said it’s very hard to get hold of her sister these days.’

Asked
 by the Mail about her marriage at a Sikh conference in London where she
 was speaking during the summer, Alexandra became defensive and finally 
replied: ‘God is my true love.’  She told a newspaper at the weekend: 
‘Many believe, don’t talk unless it improves on silence.’

A
 brother of Mr Singh, Jyoti Singh, said he did not believe the couple 
had separated but had very little contact with them and was uncertain of
 their current whereabouts.

Traditional: After her marriage, Ally had stopped dyeing her hair blonde and adopted a simpler lifestyle

Alexandra
 was photographed last year walking barefoot in India dressed in long 
traditional robes and clutching a spear in one hand and a bag of bananas
 in the other.

Speaking 
about that moment she first saw Mr Singh in 2011, she recalled: ‘I was 
sitting on the roof of the Golden Temple at about 3am, and the most 
beautiful man I’d ever seen in my whole life walked in.

‘He seemed 100 per cent man, gentle and intuitive and poetic and sensitive, but also extraordinarily strong and manly.

‘And you don’t see many of these around. So I was like: “Oh wow!”’
