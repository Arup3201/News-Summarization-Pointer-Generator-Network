Driver: Gagandeep Kakkad, 23, was banned from driving after admitting causing death by careless driving after Neil Bird died

A drunken pedestrian knocked down and killed by a hybrid car while walking home may not have heard its quiet engine as it approached him, a court heard.

Neil Bird suffered severe head injuries and was pronounced dead in hospital following the collision with a hybrid Toyota Prius.

Gagandeep Kakkad was banned from driving, ordered to carry out community service and pay court costs after admitting causing death by careless driving.

The 23-year-old avoided going to prison as the judge heard Mr Bird had been in the middle of the road and dressed completely in black when he was hit in the early hours of the morning.

There was also evidence to suggest that Kakkad was only driving around 28mph at the point of impact.

Prosecutor Sandra Beck said: 'The deceased in this case was in the road and from where the car ended up we know he was right in the middle of the carriageway Mr Kakkad was travelling in.

'It was always the Crown’s case he should have seen him for a significant period. It was quite clear there was no braking, no deviation prior to the impact.'

The court heard Kakkad, a student of micro-electronics at Brunel University, had been working at one of his father’s restaurants.

He left to go home, giving a colleague a lift on the way, along a route he had never driven at night.

As they drove along Wokingham Road in Reading, Berkshire shortly after 4am, Kakkad claimed he was distracted by the lights of an oncoming car.

His passenger, however, saw the figure in the road and said: 'Slow, slow,' but to no avail.

Mr Bird’s head hit the corner of the roof and the windscreen pillar and although he was rushed to hospital for emergency treatment the 43-year-old died of his injuries.

He had been wandering home to Highgate Road, in Woodley, Berkshire, from Reading’s Purple Turtle bar, where he was a regular.

Thomas Garner, for the defence, said his client’s estimated speed of less than 30mph may have been significant, particularly given the type of vehicle involved.

'The evidence from a taxi driver, who had encountered the deceased in the road minutes earlier, the evidence from buses, from CCTV, does show the deceased in the carriageway and weaving in and out.

Silent: Neil Bird suffered severe head injuries and was pronounced dead in hospital following the collision with the hybrid Toyota Prius (file picture). The defence said the lack of engine noise might not have alerted him

'It may be the lack of significant engine noise may not have alerted him.'

He said his client had accepted he was responsible but that he nevertheless believed it had been a tragic accident.

Kakkad had stopped at the scene, dialled 999 and, together with a passing cyclist, desperately tried to help Mr Bird.

'It has caused him significant problems,' said Mr Garner.

'He described being in total shock for about a week afterwards. He didn’t really believe it had happened. There’s a degree of confusion on his part. He said he was having dreams that he had seen him (Mr Bird) earlier in the evening.

'It is clearly a tragedy that will stay with the Bird family forever but also a tragedy that will stay with Mr Kakkad forever.

Mr Bird had been wandering home from the pub to Highgate Road, in Woodley, Berkshire, from Reading’s Purple Turtle bar, where he was a regular. The crash happened in Wokingham Road, pictured

'It is a nightmare for him.'

The student had interrupted his university course because of what happened and was intending to resume it in 2014.

The court heard that Mr Kakkad was distracted by the lights from an on-coming car and should have seen Mr Bird.

Judge Zoe Smith said: 'You were driving a hybrid car and driving up the Wokingham Road. Mr Bird had been walking down the road and there is evidence from a taxi driver that Mr Bird had started walking into the road, both into the bus lane and the main carriageway itself.

'As you were driving along it seems your attention was drawn to the right. You thought there was a car coming round the corner.

'This is a little more than momentary inattention.'

She accepted Kakkad, of Purley on Thames, Berkshire was genuinely extremely remorseful.

The judge ordered him to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work over 12 months, to pay £1,200 pounds in court costs, and she also disqualified him from driving for 18 months and ordered him to take an extended test to regain his licence.
