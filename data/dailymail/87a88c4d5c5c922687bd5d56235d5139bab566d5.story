As research topics go, it has to be one of the most bird-brained.

A university has received £2million of taxpayers’ cash to investigate how humans have got on with chickens over the past 8,000 years.

The Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) awarded the grant to a three-year study, led by Bournemouth University, called ‘Cultural and Scientific Perceptions of Human-Chicken Interactions’.

Mark Maltby (pictured) reader in Archaeology at Bournemouth University is involved in the three year study. The controversial £2m grant, will be used to fund experts from six universities while they examine and collate data, write articles and go on field trips to examine the history of the chicken

But critics have reacted with fury 
that public money is going to such a project while funds for the 
disabled and sick are being cut.

Some
 of the cash will even be used to send students to live in Cuba and 
Ethiopia to learn about how  people there interact with chickens.

The study begins in January, and  will involve archaeologists, PhD  students, geneticists and anthropologists.

Project
 leader Mark Maltby, reader in archaeology at Bournemouth University, 
said: ‘What we uncover about chickens may lead us to find out more of a 
wider history about the people keeping them.’

And
 he defended the size of the grant, saying it will be shared between 
university researchers at Bournemouth, Roehampton, Nottingham, Durham, 
Leicester and York. The results of the research will be used in a series
 of exhibitions in museums across Britain.

Some of the funding will be used to send students to live in Cuba and Ethiopia (pictured) to study how people there interact with chickens. But taxpayer campaign groups are crying fowl over the publicly funded project and have branded it a 'ridiculous study'

The three-year investigation will start in January and will be carried about by academics including archaeologists, PHD students, geneticists, and anthropologists. Researchers will examine when domesticated chickens spread across Europe and when humans started using them for meat and eggs

A
 spokesman for the AHRC  said: ‘Today there are well over 20billion 
chickens worldwide, yet we still know very little about their social and
 cultural history.

pugh

Our attitudes towards chickens are complex – from the
 rituals of the roast dinner  on Sunday and the convenience of fast 
food, to named birds kept in back yards.

‘This
 project will conduct detailed analysis of their natural and cultural 
history in the West and the findings will be shared with poultry 
breeders and schoolchildren.’

But
 Robert Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said yesterday: ‘This is 
frankly an absurd sum of money to spend on what appears to be a 
ridiculous study.

‘Given the
 limited budget and important challenges facing the UK, research like 
this should be way down the pecking order for taxpayer-funded grants.’

Meanwhile,
 the Dorset Blind Association is struggling to secure £40,000 of funding
 to maintain services it offers to vulnerable people.

Its
 chief executive, Jonathan Holyhead, said: ‘I am really struggling to 
see why funding something of this nature should take priority over a 
charity supporting disabled people.

‘I am also struggling to understand the need for this research, especially given how tight funding is for a charity like ours.

‘We have spoken to the local authority several times about funding without success.’

The money will be used to send students to live in Cuba and Ethiopia as well as to pay academics for collating data and writing reports

The University of Bournemouth-led project aims to investigate the history of the birds, which could tell scientists more about the people who kept them
