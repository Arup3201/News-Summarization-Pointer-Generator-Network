A retired soldier flew thousands of miles to reunite with the intrepid German shepherd that served alongside him in Iraq and the touching footage has quickly gone viral.

Retired Air Force Sergeant David Simpson made a best friend in the form of military pooch Robbie as the two served together securing dangerous city streets in Iraq for four years.

But their beautiful relationship came to an abrupt halt a year ago when Simpson left the military and his canine comrade continued to serve.

Heartwarming: Touching footage of retired Air Force sergeant David Simpson reuniting with his canine partner of four years has quickly gone viral

The intervening months were so difficult for Simpson that he immediately purchased a $2,000 plane ticket to Germany to adopt Robbie when he learned that dog, too, was retiring.

'[It's] probably the most difficult task we have to do, other than having your dog passing away,' the father of three, who now lives in Mulberry, Florida, told FOX 13.

'It was very tough to go through, and you don't know if the dog understands. Having to say goodbye, that is heartbreaking.'

Thankfully, the heartbreak was only temporary.

pup missed Simpson as much as the soldier missed him.

'My goal for him is to allow him to have as much fun and relaxation for the rest of his life. I just want him to enjoy his retirement,' Simpson said

Now Robbie is living in the Simpson household, learning how to live ina family full of young children.

If more recent footage of the dog frollicking in Simpson's sunny backyard is any indication, the transition won't be all that hard.

And either way, Robbie deserves to be happy as much as master.

'My goal for him is to allow him to have as much fun and relaxation for the rest of his life. I just want him to enjoy his retirement,' Simpson said.
