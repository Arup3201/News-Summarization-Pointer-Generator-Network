A medical director at a Reading, Massachusetts, fertility clinic has been accused of molesting his patients while they were under anesthetic, for at least a decade.

A total of 18 witnesses, including nurses, surgical technicians, colleagues, and other fertility physicians at the Fertility Centers of New England said they saw Dr Roger Ian Hardy rub patients' genitals, attempt to stimulate them while sedated using a hose and touch their breasts.

The doctor received his first complaint from a patient in 2004, according to records of a state investigation but the Massachusetts Board of Registration in Medicine closed the case without taking action against Hardy.

Accused molester: Dr Roger Hardy, pictured, a medical director at a Reading, Massachusetts, fertility clinic, has been accused of molesting his patients while they were under anesthetic, for at least a decade

The 55-year-old was able to continue practicing despite employees reporting at least three other incidents of alleged molestation over the years.

According to the Boston Globe, which obtained the documents, it was only this year that the 20-year veteran of reproductive endocrinology resigned his medical license after new allegations were made to the medical board, sparking an investigation.

On January 21, Hardy stepped down. The redacted records do not shed any light on why Hardy's alleged behavior was allowed to continue for so long.

Hardy denied the claims to a board investigator before his resignation, suggesting they might be a competitor attempting to frame him for their own benefit, according to the records.

It's not known who the latest allegations came from.

But it was a patient who first complained in 2004 about the physician, writing the board in a 2004 letter, 'I was afraid ... that something criminal had been done to me.'

According to the Globe, the alleged victim described suffering trauma to her genitals during a procedure Hardy performed in December 2003 at the Hunt Center in Danvers, then part of Beverly Hospital.

She said she was sedated at the time.

Hardy vehemently denied the accusation at the time, insisting three 'professional assistants' were present in the operating room.

The Department of Public Health, which licenses the fertility clinic, has confirmed it too is conducting 'an ongoing investigation' into the alleged molestations.

One fertility physician at the clinic told board investigators that nurses were afraid to speak out for fear of losing their jobs after.

The Globe cites an investigatorâ€™s affidavit as saying that a nurse and a technician who reported one incident to a superior were told not to talk about it. But records show one nurse ignored this advice and filed an anonymous report with the board.

However it was only until last October, when one physician filed a formal complaint with the medical board, that an investigation was launched.

That doctor said she was 'horrified' after a longtime patient revealed to her that Hardy had touched her sexually and rubbed her genitals, telling her it was a routine part of the examination and her fertility treatment.

The patient, in her 40s, said the alleged molestation took place during several unchaperoned appointments in 2011.

The patient later came forward to the board.

Hardy, a University of Cincinnati College of Medicine graduate, was also licensed in Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine, and California. Maine and New Hampshire authorities have suspended his license.

His attorney, Martin Foster of Cambridge, did not return the Globe's calls seeking comment.
