Will Brazil win the World Cup without Neymar?

Brazil fans have brought posters of the Rolling Stones front-man dressed in a Colombia shirt to try and ensure they don't lose like Jagger.

Mick Jagger has developed a reputation for his woeful predictions as every team he has backed so far has crashed out of the World Cup.

And superstitious Brazilians have sought to harness his power of incorrect prediction by depicting him supporting their quarter-final opponents.

Jagger's reputation has developed over the past four years, but has been particularly noticeable this World CUp.

At a concert in Rome last month he predicted to 70,000 fans that four-time World Cup champion Italy would pull off a clutch victory over Uruguay to advance to the knockout phase. The Italians lost 1-0 and headed home after the Group Stage.

At a show in Lisbon in May, the singer predicted that Portugal, led by Cristiano Ronaldo, would win it all at the month-long tournament in Brazil. Portugal also went home before the knock-out stages.

Earlier in the World Cup, Jagger suffered some good-hearted ridicule after taking to Twitter on June 19 to urge on his native England in a game, also with Uruguay. "Let's go England! This is the one to win!!," he wrote. England lost.

While Brazilians may laugh at Jagger, they love his music. The Stones' 2006 concert on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro drew an estimated 1 million people, a lot more than the 20,000 or so that have been packing the beach to watch World Cup games on a giant screen.

Jagger also loves Brazilians, having fathered one 15 years ago with former Brazilian model Luciana Gimenez.

Brazilians' obsession with Jagger's footballing insights, or lack thereof, began four years ago at the World Cup in South Africa.

Searching for an explanation for their country's stunning quarterfinal loss to the Netherlands, Brazil's fans settled on Jagger, who showed up at the stadium accompanying his son dressed in a Brazilian shirt.

Earlier in that tournament, he had already earned a reputation for picking losers by showing up in the stands with Bill Clinton to cheer on the United States, who lost to Ghana in the second round, and then a day later watched as England were trounced by Germany 4-1.
