A quick-thinking shopkeeper bravely snatched a blundering robber's knife and turned it on his attacker during a 'terrifying' armed raid.

University student Tom Henry Waller burst into Manish Patel's Bargain Booze store brandishing a nine-inch carving knife strapped to a golf club.

But Waller's planned hold-up was foiled by Mr Patel, who grabbed the makeshift weapon and turned it on the masked robber, jabbing him with the blade before driving him out of his shop.

CCTV footage of the attack shows the would-be robber rushing out of the shop in Hull as Mr Patel thrusts the golf club at him from behind the counter.

Waller, 26, of Hull, East Yorks, has been jailed for five years after admitting the foiled raid.

The budding social worker had become 
addicted to heroin while studying and admitted his disgust at himself 
during his conviction at Hull Crown Court on Friday.

Waller said: 'My recent abhorrent and
frankly disgraceful actions are inexcusable under any circumstances. I 
am truly sorry for the grief I have caused my victims and the shame I 
have brought to my family.'I
wanted to ask my university tutors for a reference but I was too 
ashamed, particularly given the subject I was doing and the contrast 
between who they know me to be and my recent actions.

'I
have had plenty of time to seriously reflect on where my life is 
heading. The one thing I am left with is an overwhelming sense of 
clarity, which has led me to the most important epiphany of my life.'Waller added that he wanted to meet his victims to apologise personally.

Judge
Michael Mettyear said: 'You are clearly a young man who has had 
advantages in life. You are educated and articulate and your life has 
now been blighted by the drugs you take.

'You had gone to Hull University and 
you had been hoping to do well there until the addiction to heroin 
emerged or increased. Any of these would be serious offences on their 
own but, together, they are all the more serious.'Waller burst into BetFred with a carving knife and demanded money from the cashier before escaping with just £80 on March 12.Jharna
Jobes, prosecuting, said: 'There was a customer in the store at the 
time, who grabbed a chair to protect himself. There was a tussle between
them and the defendant told the cashier, "Give us some money or I will 
hurt him".'

Jailed: Mr Patel emerged from behind the counter to make sure Waller, who has been jailed for five years, was gone

Waller, of West Hull, was caught after he left his bike outside Bargain Booze after the raid on March 14. He later called police to report his bike - matching the description of the one left outside the shop - had been stolen.Mrs Jobes said: 'When he entered the store, he had a weapon that appeared to be two golf clubs that had been attached together, with a knife on the end of them.'His face was covered with material, leaving two holes for eyes, and his mouth was covered with a scarf. Mr Patel grabbed the golf club, which caused him to run out of the shop.'All of his victims had been left 'terrified' insisted Mrs Jobes.When officers searched Waller's home, they found a note in his jacket pocket which read 'I have a 9mm pistol and I will use it if you don't keep calm and hand the money over quickly'.It was not used in any of the crimes. Waller pleaded guilty to the robbery at Betfred and attempted robbery at Bargain Booze.His barrister, Steven Garth, said Waller turned to crime to pay off drug dealers who were threatening him with violence.Mr Garth said: 'If ever there was a case which illustrated the evil of drugs, this is it. He is riddled to the core with guilt for what he has done.'
