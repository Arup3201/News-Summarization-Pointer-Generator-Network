A father left his two sons feeling over-the-moon after building them a Nasa space simulator and life-like mission control center in their bedrooms.

Jeff Highsmith, 35, spent more than four months piecing the spacecraft together for his four-year-old boy, Jasper, and around $800 on the gravity-defying desk for his six-year-old son, Gavin.

The spaceship features a number of switches, sound effects, LED readouts, joysticks and even a fully-functioning robotic arm.

Out of this world: Father-of-two Jeff Highsmith built this space simulator for his four-year-old boy, Jasper

Having a blast: Gavin Highsmith uses the mission control desk that his father built him

Father-of-two Mr Highsmith, from Raleigh, North Carolina, said: 'When my older son started kindergarten, he needed a desk upon which to do his homework.

'I figured I'd build him a dual purpose desk, one for work and play - thus, the mission control desk was born.

'While building that, I realised that I should do something cool for my other son's room, and the natural solution seemed to be a spaceship.

Switched on father: Mr Highsmith built in plenty of buttons and dials for his two sons to play with

Missions: Mr Highsmith said that his sons love playing at astronauts and take it in turn to be in charge

Ambitious: The project Mr Highsmith undertook for his sons certainly wasn't' an everyday DIY job

'They both love playing space and their ability to work together impresses me.

'They haven't learned all the space lingo yet, so their missions are often silly, but that's perfect.

'They spot aliens and deploy payloads and make up all sorts of strange things.

'They incorporate other toys into their space play, as well, such as wooden blocks, Legos, and stuffed animals - they really enjoy using it.'

Full-time videomaker Mr Highsmith said he completed the entire project from the comfort of his garage and that his sons often enjoy going on 'space mission' together.

He said: 'They alternate mission control and astronaut duties - it all depends on who feels like they want to run the show and who feels like they want to fly the ship.

'I designed every aspect to be inexpensive, yet straightforward enough for other self-taught hobbyists to replicate.

'Although it was a rather complicated build, no-one should rule it out as something they can't do.

'I'm not an engineer and I have no formal training in electronics.

'I'm just a self-taught hobbyist fairly far along in my learning journey.

'With the Internet, so much knowledge is available for folks that want to teach themselves new skills.

'I just want to provide my boys with a broad variety of experiences to show them what is possible and help them discover and develop their talents and passions.'
