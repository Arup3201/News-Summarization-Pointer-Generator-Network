Rory McIlroy may have been left disappointed after a certain BBC awards ceremony earlier in December but events on Sunday evening went some way to reconciling that.

The 25-year-old beat 11 other nominees to win the RTE Sports Personality of the Year Award  for a second time in four years.

Niamh Briggs, Seamus Coleman, Briege Corkery, Mark English, Carl Frampton, Michael McKillop, James O’Donoghue, Jonathan Sexton, Jason Smyth, Richie Hogan and Katie Taylor were the 25-year-old's competitors for the title.

McIlroy has enjoyed a remarkable 2014, winning two Majors, the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational and the Race to Dubai.

The world No 1 also scooped a host of individual awards in 2014 including the Arnold Palmer Award, PGA Player of the Year, PGA Tour Player of the Year, Vardon Trophy, and Byron Nelson Award. 

Ireland rugby coach Joe Schmidt was named manager of the year 

Many were surprised when McIlroy lost out to Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton in the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award earlier in the month.

But the Open Championship-winner was spared a second disappointment after being voted top of the pile by Irish sports fans.
