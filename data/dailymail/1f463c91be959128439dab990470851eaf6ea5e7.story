It has the best bits of Christmas dinner with all the trimmings - but in a doughnut.

Made from sage infused dough and a roasted potato crumb, this savoury treat has a sausage and onion gravy filling and is topped with cured maple candied bacon, turkey salt and cranberry glaze.

The festive doughnut, which costs £2.25, is on sale at Essex bakers Godfreys.

Mark Godfrey who owns Godfreys thought the idea for a Christmas dinner doughnut 'sounded a bit crazy' 

Mark Godfrey, owner of Godfreys of Hornchurch, said: 'To start with it sounded a bit crazy, but classic flavour combinations, a wealth of baking experience and a bit of Christmas spirit have made it into something really special.'

Stephen Cross, from London advertising agency Karmarama, who helped come up with the idea and who is a regular at the bakery, said: 'We're always on the lookout to make interesting ideas happen and it's great to do them with someone like Godfreys who are willing to try something new.'

The Ho-Ho-Honuts will be available in Godfreys flagship store in Hornchurch, Essex while stocks last. 

Tesco's Turkey and Stuffing 'weirdoughs'

When it comes to doughnuts there are few combinations that haven't been tackled with Krispy Kreme serving up a mincemeat treat every December.

So it was only a matter of time before savoury takes on the snack hit the shelves.

Tesco is the true pioneers in this area with its range of 'weirdoughs' including a smoky bacon and cheese and onion flavour.

The supermarket giant's festive take on its range is Turkey & Stuffing flavour.

Priced at £1 for ten mini-doughnuts, reviewers have compared them to 'the real thing' adding that the doughy consistency helps make it more true to life.

And Tesco isn't the only supermarket jumping on board the bizarre dough trend.

Iceland has added a range of savoury doughnuts to its frozen party food range.

The Duck In Doughnuts contains a variety of savoury duck filled doughnuts with various crunchy toppings.

This Christmas season has seen the creation of some weird festive food fads.

Mayfair Pizza Co debuted its Christmas Pudding Pizza served flaming at the table and made with Christmas pudding, custard brandy and redcurrant compote.

It also launched a savoury Christmas Dinner Pizza laden with pulled turkey, pigs-in-blankets, chestnut stuffing, roast potatoes, root vegetables, redcurrant compote and bread sauce.

Sainsbury's teamed up with London Cocktail Club owner JJ Goodman to create a mincemeat cocktail

As well as party food taking an unusual turn party drink also took on a strange identity this season.

Marks & Spencer unveiled a Christmas Cake Liqueur described as the 'taste of the festive season in a glass'.

Sainsbury's teamed up with London Cocktail Club owner JJ Goodman to create an unusual mincemeat cocktail.

Marks & Spencer went one step further and combined the much-maligned Brussels sprout with apple and pear for a sweet drink.

Ingredients:  50ml Irish Cream, 25ml  Cognac, two teaspoons of fruit mincemeat, 25ml whole milk one whole clementine

Method

1. Apart from the clementine, add all of the ingredients to a cocktail shaker filled with ice.

2. Shake vigorously for ten seconds to allow for some of the dilution and to properly chill the drink. 

3. Then strain the cocktail into a martini glass or a short glass filled with cubed ice.

4. Take a clementine and a potato peeler, zest a strip of peel 3cm wide and 6cm long. 

5. Twist the peel over the glass orange side down to spray the oils over the drink, which will give you an amazing smell as you sip.
