As the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow is used to unruly, screeching crowds.

And as these pictures of him in a 1975 episode of the chaotic children's television programme, Crackerjack, show, he started young.

The 12-year-old schoolboy looked nervous in his school blazer and tie as he was introduced to an audience of chanting children on the popular show by host Ed Stewart.

TV debut: The 12-year-old John Bercow appeared on Crackerjack in 1975 but came last in an obstacle race

Stewart told the audience: 'Let's meet the lads', before introducing 'John' as one of four schoolboys to take part in a race involving scooping up curtain rings onto broom handles.

Bercow managed to scoop up just two of the four rings and finished last in the weekly show, known for its catchphrase 'It's Friday, it's five o'clock, it's Crackerjack!'

The long-haired future politician was awarded a Crackerjack pencil for his efforts, and was told by the host: 'I hope you have happy writing days', reported Guido Fawkes in the Sun on Sunday.

Crackerjack ran from 1955 to 1984 and was presented by hosts including Eamonn Andrews, Leslie Crowther, Michael Aspel, Ed Stewart, and Stu Francis.

Every time the host said the word 'Crackerjack' the children in the audience at the BBC Television Theatre (later the Shepherds Bush Empire) would scream 'CRACKERJACK' back, giving the show its frantic atmosphere.

Last week Bercow, now 51 and the Conservative MP for Buckingham, was branded a hypocrite after ordering MPs to cut out 'yobbery and public school twittishness', but using 'bully-boy' tactics himself in the Commons.

The Commons Speaker is leading a new 
campaign for them to think about how they appear on TV during Prime 
Minister's Questions.

But this weekend, Bercow was accused of hypocrisy by the man he branded a 'nutter' in  a Commons debate shortly before becoming Speaker.

In April 2009, the MP took  part in a debate led by his friend and fellow Tory MP Julian Lewis which featured a series of highly personal attacks on Terry Scriven, the Liberal Democrat candidate in Mr Lewis’s New Forest seat.

After Mr Lewis accused Mr Scriven of being behind efforts to make public the MP’s home address, Bercow intervened to say: ‘He’s a nutter.’

Mr Scriven, who failed to beat Mr Lewis at the 2010 Election, said the experience had led to him giving up ever becoming an MP because of the impact on his family, and said the Speaker should apologise.

The son of a taxi driver, John Bercow grew up in 
north London, attending Finchley Manorhill comprehensive.

He enjoyed his first taste of fame as Britain's top junior
 tennis player, but a career in the sport was ended by glandular fever.

In 1985 he graduated with a first-class degree in Government from the University of Essex, where he was known as 'very right-wing', 'very bright', and 'quite stroppy'.

Order!  The Speaker has recently asked MPs to stop behaving like 'yobs' during debates in the House of Commons

He
 became secretary of the notorious Conservative Monday Club, and once 
campaigned for 'assisted repatriation' of immigrants. He later described
 his membership as 'utter madness'.

Bercow
 then began a political journey from the hard right to the left. Jobs in
 merchant banking and lobbying were followed by a spell as a special 
adviser to Tory Cabinet ministers Jonathan Aitken and Victoria 
Bottomley.

Elected as an MP
 in 1997, he served on the Tory frontbench but was sacked after backing 
Anne Widdecombe for saying then-leader Michael Howard had 'something of 
the night' about him.

Campaigning
 on gay rights, Burma, international development and special needs 
teaching, there were rumours he would defect to Labour.

Instead
 he quietly manoeuvred to become a frontrunner to become Commons 
Speaker, and won the election almost entirely thanks to votes from 
Labour MPs. It is thought only three of his Tory colleagues backed him.

Family: Bercow is married to Sally, pictured, and they have three children, Oliver, Freddie and Jemima

Since
 then Bercow has been repeatedly accused of bias, favouring Labour MPs 
while launching verbal assaults on many Tories, including David Cameron.

He married Sally in 2002, and they have two sons and one daughter.

Despite his early TV exposure, he was said to be furious at his wife for appearing on screen in Celebrity Big Brother.

Not
 known to use one word when five will do, he was reluctant to get drawn 
into commenting after photographs emerged of his wife kissing DJ and personal trainer 
Clinton Oliver at a London nightclub.

'People shouldn’t assume that they know what is right or that it is necessary for them to prescribe for others,' he said.

'Sally and I have known each other for a very long time and I think we’re quite capable of looking after ourselves.'
