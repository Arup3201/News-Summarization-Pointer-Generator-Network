On trial: Noel Bertrand, 27, is accused of violently raping a 22-year-old woman he met in a bar in Denver International Airport last April

A 23-year-old woman who claims she was brutally raped at Denver International Airport by a man who spoke with her at a bar told the jury on Tuesday that she did not scream for help because she was being choked.

The woman testified that the suspect, 27-year-old Noel Bertrand, of Portland, Oregon, told her during the April 2011 attack that the gagging sound she was making was sexy.

On the first day of the trial, jurors heard emotional testimony from the 23-year-old woman many of them wincing in response to the graphic details of the alleged attack.

The accuser said while they were at the deserted gate, Bertrand asked if he could get a kiss, and when she effused, he became violent, telling her that she was his ‘sex slave,’ and that he was going to teach her to ‘feel pleasure for pain.’

‘Every time I tried to move he kept hitting my head on the ground,’ she said in court, the Denver Post reported.

The woman said her attacker eventually took her pants off and raped her. She said he slammed her head to the ground so many times to keep her subdued that she became dizzy, had blurry vision and trouble hearing.

The woman previously said that the attack lasted 20 minutes, during which time two janitors walked past, including a woman, but they looked away and did nothing.

Eventually, a pair of airline mechanics intervened during the incident that took place on the deserted Concourse A at the usually crowded airport.

However, Bertrand's lawyer, Wadi Muhaisen, claims the woman had rough, consensual sex with Bertrand and then regretted it.

Face to face: The unnamed accuser left, told the jury how Bertrand, right, repeatedly slammed her head to the ground and ripped her crucifix while sexually assaulting her

Fateful meeting: The alleged attack took place on April 12, 2011, after both Bertrand and his accuser missed their flight connections and got stranded at the airport overnight

On April 12, 2011, the alleged victim was on her way to a Catholic convent community in Illinois where she was set to enroll in a religious studies program.

She missed her connection and went to the airport bar, where she ran into Bertrand, who was also stranded at the airport overnight.

The 23-year-old told the jury that Bertrand, then 26, appeared to be a nice guy, and the two struck up a conversation about religion, philosophy and his military service. At around midnight, the two were captured on surveillance video walking together to the waiting area at one of the gates.

That is when the decorated former U.S. Marine suddenly turned on her, demanding a kiss and then grabbing her by the hair after she rebuffed him, the woman told the court.

‘I was making gagging sounds,’ she said. ‘I wasn't trying to say “no” anymore. I was just trying to breathe. He was saying that the sound I was making was sexy.’

Appeal to higher power: The woman, a Catholic who was on her way to a religious studies program, said she was reciting the Hail Mary prayer throughout the attack

At one point, Bertrand ripped her crucifix and threw it to the ground. Throughout the assault, the alleged victim, who is a practicing Catholic, continued praying.

‘The whole time I was trying to pray Hail Marys in my head,’ the woman recalled. ‘Then I heard shouting. It sounded really far away.’

The screams came from two Frontier airline mechanics, Kris Musil and Mark Adams, who came to her aid and pulled Bertrand off the woman.

In response, the Marine tried to hug the bruised woman and told them that they could not distinguish between rough sex and fighting.

Evidence A surveillance camera at the airport captured Bertrand walking with the woman prior to the alleged attack

Rescuers: Two Frontier mechanics, Mark Adams, left, and Kris Musil, right, saw the woman on the floor and came to her aid, pulling Bertrand off of her

Bertrand is said to have told the 
detective who interviewed him that he prefers a 'dominant-submissive 
role' and believed the woman wanted to be submissive.

Stellar service: Bertrand was a Marine for about six years, from 2003 to 2009, during which time he received won the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal

During the Tuesday’s hearing, the 
defense challenged the alleged victim’s claim that it was a rape, saying
that she did not make any effort to distance herself from Bertrand.

‘You didn't pull away from him. You didn't roll over. You didn't just drop,’ Muhaisen said.

In response to the 23-year-old’s assertion that she could not call for help because she was  having an asthma attack, the attorney said that in the past, she was capable of screaming even at a time of respiratory distress, but not on that day last April.

Muhaisen challenged other parts of the woman's testimony as well, pointing out that she had not told anyone about certain details of the attack, among them Bertrand biting her face around her mouth or groping her breasts, prior to the trial.

The Denver Post reported that Bertrand was a Marine for about six years, from 2003 to 2009, and that he won the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal.

According to Leatherneck, a Marine magazine, Bertrand served as a corporal at U.S. embassies including Dublin in Ireland and Caracas in Venezuela.
