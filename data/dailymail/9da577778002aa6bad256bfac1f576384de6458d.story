Most girls who keep a diary don't expect anyone to read it, let alone the whole world to watch it play out on a big screen.

But that's just what's happening to Maya Van Wagenen, who was 13 when she began keeping a diary about her endeavor to become popular - with the help of some seemingly archaic tips from a Fifties advice book .

Now, at the age of 15, Maya's journal is being turned into a six-figure book deal by Penguin and has been recently bought by DreamWorks for a film, making her 'the youngest non-actor to ever make a feature deal at DreamWorks,' according to Deadline.

Maya Van Wagenen, now 15, was 13 when she began a diary about her endeavor to become popular, with the help of a Fifties advice book. Now, her diary is being turned into a film by DreamWorks

Some of the guidance she followed and wrote about included 'every girl should wear a girdle' and 'be the girl who . . can do a million and one tricks with a strand of pearls'

The movie, which is expected to be written by Sex and the City screenwriter Amy B Harris, will be based on her forthcoming two-part memoir called Popular: One Geek's Quest For The Impossible.

It chronicles how in eighth grade, Maya, a self-confessed 'geek', discovered how to become popular at her new school in Brownsville, Texas, thanks to advice from Betty Cornell's Glamour Guide for Teens, a book written over 50 years ago.

Some of the guidance she followed included 'every girl should wear a girdle,' 'be the girl who . . can do a million and one tricks with a strand of pearls' and 'as for making up your eyes, don't. Young eyes need no enhancement.'

Betty Cornell's Glamour Guide for Teens was written in 1951 by former model Betty Cornell, who was known as 'the toast of the teens'

While these may tidbits sound outdated, Deadline notes that the most important lessons she took from the book were 'timeless ones' like being open, honest and kind to everyone.

'She found that each social clique was distrustful of the others, and that all of the kids bore similar insecurities,' notes the website.

Ultimately, 'she was able to find common ground and feel for the first time like she belonged.'

Penguin Group bought the rights to Maya's diary in June, reportedly striking a deal in the $300,000 range.

The first title in the two-book series will be published in 2014 under Dutton Children's Books.

Julie Strauss-Gabel, vice president of the publisher, said in a statement: 'Her voice instantly grabbed my attention.

'Maya is not only a strong teen voice, she is a standout writer of any age.'

Betty Cornell's Glamour Guide for Teens was written in 1951 by former model Betty Cornell at the age of 24, just a few years after she became known as 'the toast of the teens' for her junior modeling work.

According to a release about Maya's story, one of the many surprises the teenager encountered during her experiment was getting to meet and befriend Betty herself.
