Hundreds of coloured post-it notes are adorning the facade of Hong Kong House in Sydney in support of the tens of thousands of pro-democratic protesters in Hong Kong.

Hand written messages of solidarity with the city's 'umbrella revolution' have been stuck all along the heritage building that houses Hong Kong's economic and trade office in the heart of the central business district of Sydney.

Supplies of post-it notes and pens are available for passers-by to offer encouraging words for the protesters calling on the Chinese Government to allow free and democratic elections to take place.

These are just some of the hundreds of words of support for pro-democratic protesters in Hong Kong

Tens of thousands of pro-democracy protesters extended a blockade of Hong Kong streets on Tuesday, stockpiling supplies and erecting makeshift barricades ahead of what some fear may be a push by police to clear the roads before Chinese National Day.  

Australian students, parents and tourists have added their personal messages on the building around a sign saying 'Support Hong Kong's fight for democracy' with hundreds more notes already blown away throughout the city streets.

'Democracy is not only about Hong Kong, it's about a hope for the future,' said one note as it peeled off the sandstone wall. 

'Support the students - condemn violence' one supporter wrote.

'You are not alone - Go HK!' another said.

While one post-it simply said 'never give up'.

Some notes expressed signs of heavy emotions with one saying 'Chinese gov is worse than terrorist.' 

'If you don't fight for HK Shame on you! stop heavy police force against residents and students Democracy for Hong Kong,' another note said.
