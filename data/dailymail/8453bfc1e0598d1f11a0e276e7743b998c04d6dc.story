A healthy adult should be consuming something in the region of 2,000 calories a day, according to the Department of Health.

But a new photo series by the New York Times reveals just how different 2,000 calories can look at America's favorite food chains. In fact, in some cases just a single dish is enough to meet that quota.

At the Cheesecake Factory, for instance, the Louisiana Chicken Pasta clocks in at 2,370 calories - no drinks or sides required.

Cheesecake Factory: The Louisiana Chicken Pasta clocks in at 2,370 calories

Sonic: The chain's Peanut Butter Caramel Pie Shake contains 2,090 calories

IHOP: A Classic Skillet, with sausage contains 1,880 calories (the pancakes are included and served alongside the main dish). A glass of orange juice contains 110 calories

And while IHOP's Classic Skillet with sausage might appear to feed two (or even three), it is actually intended as a 1,880-calorie dish for one. A glass of orange juice at 110 calories brings it closer to a 2,000 total. 

At Sonic, all one needs is a Peanut Butter Caramel Pie Shake to consume 2,090 calories in one swift sitting, while a slice of Zuccotto cake at Maggiano's Little Italy  is 1,790 calories all by itself (a cappuccino on the side would be an additional 220 calories).

You get more bang for your calorie buck at McDonald's, where you'd need to order a Crispy Chicken sandwich with bacon (750 calories), fries (340 calories), Coke (200 calories) and a McFlurry with Oreos (690 calories) to hit that 2,000 mark. 

Prefer Burger King? A Double Whopper with cheese gets you halfway there at 1,070 calories. Onion rings (410 calories) and a vanilla milkshake (550 calories) complete the feast.

Burger King: A Double Whopper with cheese gets you halfway there at 1,070 calories. Onion rings (410 calories) and a vanilla milkshake (550 calories) bring the total to 2,030

Subway: A cold-cut combo (375 calories), chips (230 calories), chicken noodle soup with oyster crackers (155 calories), cookie (220 calories), Buffalo-chicken salad (360 calories), Coke (200 calories), egg-and-cheese flatbread (370 calories) and juice (100 calories) equates to 2,000 calories

One would really need to order a lot at Subway to hit 2,000 calories as many salads and sandwiches clock in at under 400 calories. A cold-cut combo (375 calories), chips (230 calories), chicken noodle soup with oyster crackers (155 calories), cookie (220 calories), Buffalo-chicken salad (360 calories), Coke (200 calories), egg-and-cheese flatbread (370 calories) and juice (100 calories) would get you there.

Two-thousand calories also equates to a hearty feast at P.F. Chang's, including orange beef (565 calories), pad thai (580 calories), spinach (120 calories), dumplings (195 calories), caramel cake (430 calories) and wine (125 calories).

At Olive Garden, it doesn't take much effort to consume 2,000 calories. In fact, just a standard meal of a salad (150 calories), breadstick (140 calories), Tour of Italy sampler (1,500 calories) and a quartino of wine (230 calories) will do it.

Starbucks: To consume 2,000 calories, one would need to order a Java Chip Frappucino (460 calories), latte (190 calories), orange mango smoothie (270 calories), grilled cheese (580 calories), popcorn (125 calories) and a sausage croissant (410 calories)

Pizza Hut:  A Meat Lover’s Stuffed Crust pizza is 880 calories. Add a cup of Mountain Dew at 440 calories, baked wings with blue cheese (340 calories), and two cookies (360 calories) and you've met your daily quota

And careful you don't overdo it at Starbucks - while away a few hours there and one could easily consume 2,000 calories in the form of a Java Chip Frappucino (460 calories), latte (190 calories), orange mango smoothie (270 calories), grilled cheese (580 calories), popcorn (125 calories) and a sausage croissant (410 calories).

The same applies to Pizza Hut, where a Meat Lover’s Stuffed Crust pizza is 880 calories. Add a cup of Mountain Dew at 440 calories, baked wings with blue cheese (340 calories), and two cookies (360 calories) and you've met your daily quota.

At Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, you could achieve the same result simply by ordering the Cowboy Ribeye steak (1,690 calories) and a martini (230 calories).

Maggiano's Little Italy: Don't order a main, don't even order a starter. This slice of Zuccotto cake is 1,790 calories all by itself. A cappuccino on the side would be an additional 220 calories

Ruth's Chris Steakhouse: Meet your daily calorie intake simply by ordering the Cowboy Ribeye steak (1,690 calories) and a martini (230 calories)

Gourmet fast food: At Chipotle you could hit 2,000 calories by ordering a carnitas burrito (945 calories, left), chips and guacamole (770 calories) and a Coke (276 calories). At Shake Shack, the same could be achieved with a Double ShackBurger (770 calories), fries (470 calories) and a Black and White shake (760 calories)
