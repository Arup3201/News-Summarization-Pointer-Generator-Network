Murder: Shelby Dasher admitted beating her baby son to death when he wouldn't stop crying

The mother of the 13-month-old baby whose body was found wrapped in a blanket and dumped in woods has been charged with his murder.

Shelby Dasher, 20, was charged with second-degree murder after admitting to police she repeatedly struck her son Tyler in a rage  because he was crying and 'wouldn't lay down, wouldn't go back to sleep'.

She also admitted disposing of his body, which was found discarded near a cemetery about a mile from his home on Tuesday, hours after Dasher reported him missing.

It followed a frantic four-hour emergency services search for the child.

Dasher originally told police she overslept that morning and discovered him gone from his crib when she awoke after claiming she put her son to bed at 10.30pm on Monday night.

Robert P. McCulloch, the prosecuting attorney, told reporters at a press conference today: 'At this point, there's no indication that we have that there's anyone else involved other than Miss Dasher.'

He said that Dasher arrived home drunk at 2.30am on Tuesday. When her mother left for work at 7.30am, Tyler would not stop crying so she beat him to death.

What happened after that is 'a bit fuzzy', according to what she told prosecutors.

Homicide: Tyler Dasher died from blunt force trauma to the head and body

Confession: Shelby Dasher said she had been drinking until 2.30am and when her mother left for work at 7.30am, she then beat her son in a rage. Everything after that was 'fuzzy' she said

Scene: Police launched a frantic search for Tyler after he was reported 'missing' by his mother Shelby

Police and the FBI mounted a massive search while questioning the mother. They noted there was no forced entry to the home.

Tyler's father, Joe Ellington, lives elsewhere in the St Louis area.

Mr
McCulloch said the child died of blunt-force trauma to the head and 
body. He said that 'as far as we know' Dasher carried the body to the 
cemetery herself.

He said officials are not aware of any prior acts of abuse.

Yesterday an area near the cemetery was cordoned off with yellow police tape as force dogs sniffed the ground. A cluster of young adults cried and hugged as they looked on.

A candlelit vigil and one minute of 
silence will be held for Tyler at 6.45pm today. Several Facebook pages 
have been set  up in his memory.
