Manchester United starlet Adnan Januzaj has revealed he has been undergoing extra work in the gym to aid his development.

The Belgium youngster made his breakthrough under David Moyes last season but has been used sparingly under new manager Louis van Gaal this term - making just eight starts.

The 20-year-old has also been criticised for going down too easily and picked up his fifth booking of his career for diving during United's 2-1 FA Cup defeat by Arsenal on Monday night.

Although Januzaj has built up his slight frame since making his debut at 18, he revealed he has been putting in extra hours at the gym to become 'stronger' during games. 

Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, he said: ''I do a lot of work in the gym,' Januzaj said.

'I am trying to be faster and stronger so I can be tougher when I go out on the pitch.

'I am doing a lot of short, sharp stuff so, when I turn a defender or go past a player, I can just get a few metres away from them with my acceleration.'
