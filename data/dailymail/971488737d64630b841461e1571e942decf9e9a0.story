A two-year-old boy has died at the home he shared with his mother and her partner.

Liam Fee was found by the emergency services after a neighbour heard a woman’s screams coming from the flat on Saturday evening.

Police are investigating his death, which is being treated as ‘unexplained’ – but said they were not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident.

Scene: Police outside a house in Fife, Scotland, where a two-year-old boy was found dead

Door-to-door: Police, who are treating the death as 'unexplained', were in the area on Sunday carrying out their investigation

Liam lived with his mother Rachael 
Fee, her lesbian partner Nyomi Fee and his seven-year-old twin brothers,
 JJ and Matthew, in the three-bedroom flat in Thornton, Fife.

Gillian
 McCusker, a friend of the couple, saw them taking Liam to the shops in 
his pushchair at around 4pm, four hours before the alarm was raised.

Miss McCusker, 35, said: ‘He seemed perfectly fine. They all seemed OK. 
The twins said hello and Liam smiled at my son. It’s horrible to think 
that was the last time he’d be seen alive. It is such a tragedy.’

Parents: Rachel Fee, Liam's mother, and her life partner Nyomi Fee

Another
 neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: ‘I heard a woman’s 
crying coming from the flat. She sounded hysterical. Then the police 
arrived.’

Local residents later saw Rachael leaving in a police car with one of the twin boys.

Police
 last night said no one had been arrested or detained in connection 
with Liam’s death. A post-mortem examination is yet to be carried out.

Uniformed officers maintained a highly visible presence outside the flat yesterday and carried out door-to-door inquiries.

Forensic experts also spent  several hours at the property on Saturday night.

Floral tributes and soft toys were left on the grass outside the flat by neighbours.

The
 two women both came  from Tyneside and struck up a relationship with 
each other after Rachael split up with  the father of her three sons.

The couple moved to Scotland about two years ago.

They
 took part in a civil ceremony in Fife a year ago and  Rachael changed 
her name from Telfer to take Nyomi’s surname. The boys also began using 
the name Fee.

The couple 
told friends that Liam suffered from autism. JJ had to use a wheelchair 
after being  diagnosed with an infection in his lower leg and foot.

But
 the two women enjoyed a lively social life and often held parties at 
their privately rented flat, where they also kept nine snakes, two dogs 
and several pet rats.

Tragic: An ambulance was called to a home in Donald Crescent, Fife, last night. Police are treating the death as unexplained

Neighbours had complained about loud music coming from their home.

Superintendent
 Dougie Milton of Police Scotland said: ‘This is a tragic set of 
circumstances where, sadly, a two-year-old boy has lost his life.

‘We are undertaking a thorough investigation and working with and supporting the immediate family.

‘It would be unfair at this time, and not right, to speculate on the cause of the death.’

A report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal.
