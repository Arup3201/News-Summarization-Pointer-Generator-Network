It was always going to be the most awkward of diplomatic encounters, as Prince Charles met Vladimir Putin after comparing him to Adolf Hitler.

But yesterday the Russian president was forced to endure a series of tense stand-offs at the D-Day commemorations.

Mr Putin cut an isolated figure as he brazenly stood apart while other world leaders were clustering around the Queen to help her down a flight of steps for the 70th anniversary event.

Icy encounter: German Chancellor Angela Merkel seemed sombre as she spoke with Mr Putin at Sword Beach in Normandy

As
 the Queen and French President Francois Hollande climbed the steps on 
to the platform, Mr Putin appeared to be one of the few world leaders 
not clapping

Not only did he have to face the 
Prince of Wales for the first time since the war of words triggered by 
Charles’ remarks, likening Mr Putin to Hitler and criticising his policy
 in Ukraine.

He also came 
face-to-face with Ukraine’s president-elect Petro Poroshenko, who 
appeared to give him the cold shoulder as he strode past the Russian 
leader.

And German Chancellor Angela Merkel seemed sombre as she spoke with Mr Putin at Sword Beach in Normandy.

There
 had been intense interest in whether Mr Putin and the Prince of Wales 
would exchange words or shake hands at the commemoration.

The
 Kremlin launched a furious attack on Prince Charles after the Daily 
Mail revealed his controversial remark, made to an 87-year-old Jewish 
woman as he met Second World War veterans during a royal tour of Canada 
last month.

He told 
great-grandmother Marianne Ferguson, who lost many family members during
 the Holocaust: ‘And now Putin is doing just about the same as Hitler.’

Prince Charles appeared happier to see Mr Obama at an International Ceremony with Heads of State at Sword Beach in Normandy, where senior figures from around the world shared a platform in the sunshine

While the Prince's criticism of Russia acting like Hitler came in an unguarded remark with a member of the public, Mr Obama has been more outspoken, warning further Moscow against taking further action against Ukraine

His
 remarks were seen as a reference to Russia’s seizure of the Crimea – 
the first annexation by a major power in Europe since the end of the 
Second World War.

Russia 
has been accused of sending undercover military forces into eastern 
Ukraine under the pretext of protecting the Russian minority population.

The
 prince’s comments provoked outrage in Moscow, where senior officials 
pointed out that nearly 30million Russians died fighting the Nazis.

Mr
 Putin accused the heir to the throne of ‘unacceptable’ behaviour 
unbefitting of a future king and said the prince’s criticism of him was 
‘not what monarchs do’.

In another awkward moment of international diplomacy, German Chancellor Angela Merkel holds her hand up to Mr Putin, while Mr Poroshenko looks on 

Mr Putin and Mr Poroshenko held talks for 15 minutes today to discuss how Russia could recognise the Ukrainian elections, according to French officials

The International Ceremony at Sword Beach brought the leaders together again, with Mr Putin, Mrs Merkel, Czech President Milos Zeman, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Ukrainian President-elect Petro Poroshenko applauding as other politicians and veterans arrived

As the diplomatic crisis escalated,  pro-Putin media in Russia linked the Royal Family to the Nazis.

A
 Russian newspaper close to the Putin regime hit out at  Charles as ‘a 
clearly defined eccentric’, whose remarks were in keeping with his 
‘royal foolishness’.

But public opinion seemed to support the prince’s intervention. He also received the support of David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband.

Mr Cameron said: ‘I’m not going to comment on the private conversations of anyone, least of all Prince Charles.’

Earlier Charles and Camilla joined the Queen at a bi-national France-UK D-Day commemoration ceremony at the British War Cemetery of Bayeux

German Chancellor Angela Merkel held a meeting with Mr Putin at the Barriere Normandy Hotel in Deauville, France today

But
 he insisted: ‘Of course, everyone’s entitled to their private 
opinions.’ Mr Clegg said the prince should be ‘free to express 
himself’.

‘I obviously 
can’t comment on a conversation which was clearly private…and I’m not 
going to start comparing one period of European history to another, but 
Prince Charles is able, I would have thought, to be free to express 
himself,’ he said.

‘I have 
never been of the view that if you are a member of the Royal Family 
somehow you have to enter into some sort of Trappist vow of silence.’

Feeling the heat, Mr Putin walks away from the meeting with Mrs Merkel held in the margins of the D-Day commemorations to mark 70 years since the Normandy landings

David Cameron met President Putin last night, the first talks since the Ukraine crisis began. Aides said it was a chance to 'look him in the eye' and tell him his behaviour was unacceptable

French President Francois Holland shook Mr Putin's hand as he arrived at the Elysee Palace last night

Yesterday
 the prince and Mr Putin stood only yards apart but there was no sign of
 any communication between them. Charles cast a glance down the line of 
world leaders towards Mr Putin, but made no attempt to approach him.

The
 Russian leader received an even cooler reception from Ukraine’s 
president-elect, who was stony-faced when he saw Mr Putin approach.

The reaction to Mr Putin’s presence contrasted starkly with the warm welcome extended to the Queen by world leaders.
