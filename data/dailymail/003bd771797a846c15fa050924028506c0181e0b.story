The mugshot of the Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev was released today giving proof that his violent streak started years before the fatal blasts.

Tsarnaev was booked in 2009 for hitting his then-girlfriend following an argument about another woman, prompting assault and battery charges that were dismissed before trial.

The mugshot photos come the day after it was announced that his body will be buried in Boston in spite of local outrage that his final resting place will be within the bounds of the city that he terrorized with pressure cooker bombs that killed three and injured more than 250 others.

Criminal past: Tamerlan Tsarnaev was arrested for assault and battery in 2009 after slapping his girlfriend during an argument, though the charges were dismissed before going to trial

Tsarnaev's body was released to a local funeral home on Thursday after his family made arrangements to schedule a funeral.

The hearse transporting his body was met with protesters throughout its journey, but funeral director Peter Stefan said that he was just doing his professional duty by making the arrangements.

'They can protest but again what do you do? In this country, you bury the dead. I can't control the circumstances of somebody's death or what they've done or how they died,' he told Fox News.

The girlfriend: The blonde woman in this photo with Tamerlan was identified by The National Enquirer as being Nadine Ascencao, the woman who filed the charges against him

Mr Stefan added that all of the 
cemeteries in the state of Massachusetts have refused to use one of 
their plots for the terrorist, with the suggestion that a low-profile 
nondescript headstone might be best.

Tsarnaev's family also said that they 
would be ordering a second autopsy as they do not trust the American 
government rulings, fearing that his death during a gun battle with 
police was part of a conspiracy.

Medical examiners only ever release suspects bodies after they have determined the cause of death, but that verdict has not been publicly disclosed yet.

Years before he allegedly opened fire on police alongside his younger brother Dzhokhar as they were on the run from authorities, the first apparent victim of his abuse was his girlfriend.

Nadine Ascencao, 25, accused him of slapping her on July 28, 2009 during an argument over another woman - presumably Katherine Russell, whom he met at a club that year and went on to marry in 2010 - at his home in Cambridge.

At around the time they were dating, Tsarnaev posed for a series of photos in a boxing ring, and Ms Ascencao was identified by the National Enquirer as being the blonde seen wrapping his gloves in one of the pictures.

Ms Ascencao was 'crying hysterically' and called 911 to report that she was 'beat up by her boyfriend', Cambridge Police Officer Angela Pereira wrote in the arrest report.

Doing his duty: Peter Stefan, the funeral director and owner of Graham, Putnam and Mahoney Funeral Parlors, said that he can't help what Tsarnaev did but 'in this country, we bury the dead'

He admitted to slapping her and was arrested on charges of assault and battery, the complaint said. The charges were dismissed before trial.

Around 11 months after the alleged slapping incident, Tsarnaev, 26, married his wife, Katherine Russell.

Ms Russell is now the one gaining the attention of police as they are trying to determine what role, if any, she played in helping plan, execute or cover up the attacks on April 15.

Though she was initially helpful, agreeing to be interviewed for hours and giving a DNA sample to test against a trace of female DNA found on one of the bombs, she has reportedly stopped cooperating with authorities.

The New York Times cites federal sources who say that they are 'skeptical' about her prior claims to have had nothing to do with the bombings considering that she is not cooperating.

Other relatives of the bomber confirmed that they would be arranging a funeral for the 26-year-old and that his body would remain in the U.S. and not be sent back to Russia.

'Of course, family members will take possession of the body,' his uncle Tsarni said.

'We'll do it. We will do it. A family is a family.'

The move outraged Massachusetts residents, whose lives were terrorized for the week after the bombing as local, state and federal officials searched for Tamerlan and Dzhokhar.

The only ones who have received some sliver of good news in the past few days were the relatives of the three victims who died in the blasts at the marathon finish line.

A lawyer overseeing the fund dedicated to the victims announced that the families of the three who died could receive more than $1million in compensation.

Not only that, each of the people who lost a limb in the attack could expect to receive close to $1million as well. The final number of people who lost a limb- some of whom lost more than one- has not been tallied but it could be upwards of 20 people.
