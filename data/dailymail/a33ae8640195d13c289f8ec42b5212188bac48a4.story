British killer: Security experts believe the man ranting on the video has a distinct English accent

Mystery continues to surround the exact identity of the British jihadist believed to be responsible for beheading three innocent hostages, including British aid worker David Haines.

Security experts believe the black-robed killer ranting on the video has a distinct English accent, rather than another British person dubbing over the footage.

The jihadist wears a black mask, concealing all but his eyes, making it difficult to be sure the voice belonged to him. But audio experts have claimed they are ‘99 per cent’ certain the words were spoken by the man seen on camera.

Intelligence sources are understood to have identified the fanatic whose voice is heard on videos of the murders of Mr Haines, James Foley and Steven Sotloff, and are trying to track him down in Syria with state-of-the-art military technology.

Jihadi John is thought to be one of 500 British Muslims fighting with IS to impose a caliphate in Syria and Iraq.

Because of the devastating impact of air strikes on IS positions in northern Iraq, jihadist leaders are increasingly suspicious of Western fighters, amid fears they could be spies pinpointing enemy locations. But Jihadi John’s role in the latest murder suggests he remains a crucial member of the terror network and its propaganda war.

Hostages freed earlier this year said the killer was one of three UK-born militants who held captives in Raqqa, Syria – who they nicknamed John, Paul and Ringo after members of The Beatles.

Jihadi John is said to be the most intelligent of the trio. He has taken responsibility for communicating with the outside world via negotiations with the prisoners’ families and beheading videos.

He also seems to have been in charge of security, reportedly ordering captives to be moved at least ten times to foil attempts to rescue them.

Paul and Ringo are thought to have been more junior, but together with Jihadi John they carried out the most sadistic beatings.

There were also French-speaking extremists among the guards, including at least one Belgian. But the British jihadists were the most feared because of their gruesome ‘taste for the macabre’, according to a freed French hostage.

The violence included beatings, use of Taser guns, and waterboarding – a form of torture where water is poured over a cloth blocking the nose and mouth.

They forced some of the Western prisoners to take part in mock killings – US journalist Mr Foley was forced to stand in a crucifix pose. The captives were also mostly kept underground in the dark, often shackled to one another.

The first beheading video sent shockwaves across Britain as the killer spoke with a distinctive London twang and English appears to be his first language.

Linguistic experts believe the way he pronounced certain words, such as Iraqi place names, suggest he has a foreign language background – indicating his parents or grandparents may have come from the Middle East. He appears to have a skin tone consistent with African, Middle Eastern or South Asian descent.

Academics claim Jihadi John has a multicultural East London accent, a kind of ‘new cockney’. The voice patterns will have been studied in painstaking detail by security chiefs desperate to glean his identity and match it with snippets of conversation picked up in Syria.

Aircraft fitted with sophisticated equipment, which can ‘eavesdrop’ on conversations taking place tens of thousands of feet below, are listening to see if they can pick up a voice match – potentially leading them to the location of the terrorist.

However, his voice in the latest beheading video appears to be distorted, suggesting IS are trying to disguise it.

Experts believe the killer is aged under 30. He is tall and slender, and appears to be left-handed.

In the third beheading video his feet are not visible – different from footage of him murdering the two Americans when he wears modern desert boots.

Ex-captives have described Jihadi John as intelligent, educated and a devout believer in radical Islamic teachings.

He is thought to be behind a final email sent to James Foley’s family, dated August 12 – seven days before the journalist was beheaded.

In a hate-filled message, the jihadis vowed to kill Mr Foley saying: ‘You [America] and your citizens will pay the price of your bombings! The first of which being the blood of the American citizen James Foley! He will be executed as a direct result of your transgressions towards us!’

Experts said the language, use of capital letters, poor grammar and spelling mistakes supported the belief that the email was written by a working-class militant from Britain.

The fanatic has raged against Western foreign policy – in particular US air strikes on IS targets – in rants directed at Barack Obama and David Cameron in his beheading videos.

He has referred to recent US attacks, such as the targeting of the Mosul Dam and Haditha Dam in Iraq, to make it clear that the films were shot shortly before their release.

Jihadi John also appears to be motivated by a desire to fill IS’s coffers with ransom money, demanding £80million from Mr Foley’s family. European governments are believed to have paid millions of euros to free at least nine hostages held with Mr Haines and the Americans.

The militant is said to have called for the release of female Pakistani scientist Aafia Siddiqui, currently held in a US prison, as part of a deal to free Mr Foley.
