After three weeks deliberating, a Detroit jury has convicted six members of a nation-wide motorcycle club following a months-long trial that heard from 42 defendants, on charges they ran a violent drug and gambling-based organization that had meth labs all over the country.

'For too many years the Devils Diciples spread fear and violence throughout Michigan and the country,' Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell said, according to The Detroit Free Press.

'This outlaw motorcycle gang thrived on intimidation and its ability to avoid prosecution - but no longer.'  

The jury convicted the 60-year-old leader of the Diciples, Jeff 'Fat Dog' Smith, and five others.

Leader: Devils Diciples head Jeff 'Fat Dog' Smith, 60, was found guilty Friday of methamphetamine trafficking, conspiracy to obstruct justice, violent crimes in aid of racketeering and other charges

Smith, of Mount Clemens, was found guilty Friday of all charges, including racketeering conspiracy, illegal gambling and witness tampering.

Defense attorney Jerry Sabbota acknowledged that Smith anticipates a long prison sentence, expected to be life.

The trial lasted nearly four months in Detroit federal court.

The Devils Diciples has about 150 members and was formed in 1967.

The headquarters is in  Clinton Township, southeastern Michigan, and Grand Rapids.

However there were chapters in Alabama, Arizona, California, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and beyond.

The prosecution said the Devils Diciples steamrolled their operation by drug trafficking, stealing and selling motorcycles, gambling, robbery and running meth labs.

Would-be members had to see out a probation before being accepted into the club, which required approval from all other members.

Once accepted, a member was required to own a Harley Davidson, The Detroit Free Press reported.

Convicted: Paul Anthony Darrah, 50 (left), also known as Pauli, the national vice president - who relies on a breathing tank - and and Cary Dale Vandiver, 56 (right), of Alabama, also known as Gun Control, the national warlord for the club, received the same charges as their leader, Jeff Smith

Members were forced to go after and threaten or intimidate people upon request of the club.

They also were asked to lie to police, the court records show.

A major part of the indictment allegedly occurred inside the Devils Diciples clubhouse in Arizona.

A group of members, including Witort, stormed the clubhouse under the belief the chapter had broken some of the key Diciples rules.

The victims were tied up with duct tape and assaulted with guns, tasers and knives.

They were then put inside a pickup truck, driven into the desert and dumped in a ravine, where they were left to die.

The court indictment accused the club of, over the years, committing murder, attempted murder, robbery, extortion, assault and threats of violence, the indictment said. 

More than 60 firearms and more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition were seized during the investigation, and eight methamphetamine labs were dismantled, authorities said.

Meth: Scott William Sutherland, 49 (left), and Paul Anthony Darrah, 50 (right), were found not guilty of RICO and meth conspiracies. Darrah is known as the 'methamphetamine cook'

Auhtorities all over the US were involved in the case, from the FBI to state police incolved with the assorted chapters.

The Times-Herald reports the convictions as: Jeff Garvin Smith - 'Fat Dog' - was found guilty of racketeering influenced corrupt organization (RICO) conspiracy, methamphetamine trafficking conspiracy, conspiracy to obstruct justice, violent crimes in aid of racketeering (VICAR) and various substantive charges.

Paul Anthony Darrah, also known as Pauli, 50 of Macomb Township, the national vice president of the Devil's Diciples, and Cary Dale Vandiver, 56 of Alabama, also known as Gun Control, the national warlord for the club, were found guilty of the same charges as Smith .

Vincent John Witort, also known as Holiday, 64, of California, was found guilty of violations of the RICO and meth conspiracies.

Patrick Michael McKeoun, 60 of Alabama, also known as Magoo, was found guilty of RICO and meth conspiracies. The U.S. Attorney's Office lists McKeoun as a 'methampetamine cook.' 

Lesser sentence: David Randy Drozdowski, 38, was spared charged of RICO and meth conspiracy, but was found guilty of VICAR and felon in possession of a firearm

David Randy Drozdowski, 38, of Fair Haven, also known as D, was found guilty of VICAR and felon in possession of a firearm. The jury was hung on charges of RICO and meth conspiracy.

Scott William Sutherland, 49 of Redford, also known as Scotty Z, was found not guilty of RICO and meth conspiracies. He previously pleaded guilty to felon in possession.

However defense attorney Jerome Sabbota, who was representing ringleader Smith, told The Detroit Free Press that the prosecution 'did not prove its case', and that Smith wrongly wore the blame for crimes committed separately by other members.

'These guys are not mafiosos,' Sabbota said. 

'That's like saying because Obama is president he's responsible for everyone's misdeeds.'

Long-running: The Devils Diciples - who purposely misspell their name - were first formed in 1967

Online: The club has an official website that sells Devils Diciples merchandise, such as baby bibs

All six men will be sentenced at a later date.

The group sells many products online via their website, including a baby bib that says: 'My dad can beat up everybody!'
