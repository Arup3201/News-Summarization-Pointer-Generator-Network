It was one of the first big brands on the Internet - and then it died a quick death when Facebook came along.

But now MySpace is planning a triumphant return, and a sneak peek at the re-design suggests the pioneering social network may well be able to attract old fans and new with a new look that has already attracted admiring glances.

The site - which has Justin Timberlake among its investors - is apparently vanquishing the old glitzy appearance, which was never helped by giving users control over their own colour-schemes, and brining in a sleek, minimalist experience which seems influenced by Microsoft's tile-based approach seen in the latest version of Windows.

A new interface for a new era: MySpace has been redesigned 'entirely from scratch' to take on Facebook

New tune: As before, MySpace will sell itself as a strong music destination, providing playlists and utilising its 42-million song library

A message posted yesterday on the myspace.com homepage promised: 'Coming soon. The new
MySpace'.

A demonstration video showed off how the new interface both deeply integrates into Facebook and Twitter while offering its own spin on communicating online.

MySpace's was one of the darlings of the internet in the early 2000s, but faltered fo0llowing a $580m purchase by News Corp in 2005.

News Corp sold MySpace this June for $35million - just six per cent of its original purchase price.

He played Napster entrepreneur and Facebook investor Sean Parker in the 2010 cinema hit The Social Network.And apparently the musician-turned-actor took the role home with him, as he was a key player in the $35million MySpace purchase from News Corp last year.Timberlake was announced as the leader of the business strategy during the take-over, and his profile is used within the MySpace demo video.At the time of the purchase, he said: 'There's a need for a place where fans can go to interact with their favorite entertainers, listen to music, watch videos, share and discover cool stuff and just connect. MySpace has the potential to be that place.'Art is inspired by people and vice versa, so there's a natural social component to entertainment. I'm excited to help revitalise MySpace by using its social media platform to bring artists and fans together in one community.'In another interview he said: 'They weren't successful in treating and evolving the product enough, it was basically this junkheap of bad design that persisted for many many years.'There was a period of time where if they had just copied Facebook rapidly, they would have been Facebook. They were giant, the network effects, the scale effects were enormous.'

As Facebook's popularity soared, 
MySpace tried to re-launch itself as a music-centric online community, 
but never managed to reclaim its lost glory, and was stigmatised as a 
site where people's profiles descended into a clash of colours and poor 
layout.

But MySpace promised to change yesterday.

In a statement, the company said: 'We're hard at work building the new MySpace, entirely from scratch.

'But we're staying true to our roots in one important way - empowering people to express themselves however they want.

'So whether you're a musician, 
photographer, filmmaker, designer or just a dedicated fan, we'd love for
you to be a part of our brand new community.'

Visitors could leave email addresses to be sent invitations to the redesigned MySpace service.

The new photo library uses large images to navigate between albums

Earlier this year, MySpace launched a new music player that it said attracted a flood of new fans.

MySpace is vying with hot Internet music services such as Spotify, Pandora, and Rdio as people increasingly go online for entertainment content. MySpace claims the largest library of online music with about 42 million tracks.

New Corp's chief executive Rupert Murdoch told shareholders last year that the 2005 acquisition of MySpace was a 'huge mistake' and the social network was mismanaged 'in every possible way'.
