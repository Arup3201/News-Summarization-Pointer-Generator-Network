Graham Spanier, the former Penn State University president who stepped down as a result of the Jerry Sandusky child-sex abuse scandal has denied that he ignored any warning signs during his tenure.

Citing his own child abuse at the hands of his father, the 64-year-old former family therapist has come out fighting to restore his reputation after an independent report accused him of failing to prevent a 'child predator harming children for over a decade.'

Claiming that he does not know, 'anyone who had a higher level of awareness' than himself, Spanier spoke of the terrible injuries that he received at the hands of his father, which resulted in him having four surgeries as an adult to correct the damage to his nose.

Graham Spanier spoke to ABC's Nightline to explain that he did not cover-up Jerry Sandusky's sexual abuse while he was president of Penn State University

'It resulted in, of course, some emotional scarring, but also some substantial physical damage,' said Spanier to ABC Nightline.

Rejecting out of hand the findings of July's damning Freeh Report, Spanier calls its conclusions 'wrong'  and denied outright that 'he conspired to conceal a known child predator'.

The former professor said that he was only told that Sandusky had engaged in 'horseplay' with a boy in the team showers in 2001 and that his mind did not automatically think of sexual abuse.

The Freeh Report, which was commissioned by Penn State University openly questioned why Spanier failed to begin any investigation into Sandusky's behaviour.

Graham Spanier explained that he was very sensitive to any child abuse allegations after suffering physical abuse for years at the hands of his father as a young boy

'Never in my time as president of 
Penn State did I ever receive a report or even a hint that Jerry 
Sandusky was engaged in child abuse, a sexual act, criminal activity or 
anything resembling that with any child,' said Spanier.

'Had I known that, or even suspected it, I would have forcefully intervened. But I never heard a report like that.'

Furthermore,
Spanier told ABC's Nightline that he met Sandusky once only and was not
fully involved with a police investigation into another earlier 
incident of child abuse conducted by Sandusky in 1998.

'I
do not get involved in police matters. I always had a very hands-off 
attitude and issues pertaining to people were dealt with by the police, 
by human resources, or by supervisors in various areas of the 
university,' said Spanier of the 1998 incident which at the time led to 
no charges against the former defensive coach.

However,
during the second 2001 incident, Spanier received an email from 
Athletic Director Tim Curley and retired Vice President Gary Shcultz 
that spoke of letting Sandusky off with a warning after he was caught 
with a boy in the showers.

Spanier
agreed to this, but noted in an email that by failing to report it to 
the police, they would be 'vulnerable for not having reported it.'

Speaking to Nightline, Spanier said that his choice of words was unfortunate and that he had 'no recollection of being concerned' that the school might be leaving itself open to be legally liable.

'I never, ever heard anything about child abuse or sexual abuse or my antennae raised up enough to even suspect that. So I know that’s been taken out of context, and I suspect that whoever leaked those e-mails wanted them to be taken out of context,' said Spanier to the New Yorker Magazine.

Penn State president Graham Spanier and his lawyers also attacked the Freeh report on the Jerry Sandusky sex abuse scandal on Wednesday, calling it a 'blundering and indefensible indictment' as they fired a pre-emptive strike while waiting to hear if he'll be charged in the case.

Lawyer Timothy Lewis called Louis Freeh, the former FBI director and federal judge behind the report, a 'biased investigator' who piled speculation on top of innuendo to accuse Spanier in a cover-up of early abuse complaints.

'The Freeh report, as it pertains to Dr. Spanier, is a myth. And that myth ... ends today,' Lewis said at a downtown Philadelphia news conference.

Spanier did not attend. But he told media outlets in stories published hours later that he never understood the early complaints about Sandusky, who this year was convicted of molesting 10 boys, to be sexual.

'I'm very stunned by Freeh's conclusion that - I don't think he used the word `cover-up'; but he uses the word `concealed,'' Spanier told The New Yorker magazine. 'Why on earth would anybody cover up for a known child predator? Adverse publicity? For heaven's sake! Every day I had to make some decision that got adverse publicity.'

Spanier told ABC that he was told only that Sandusky had been seen engaging in 'horseplay' in a campus shower with a boy and he took that to mean 'throwing water around, snapping towels.'

'I wish in hindsight that I would have known more about Jerry Sandusky and his terrible, terrible hidden past so that I could have intervened because it would have been my instinct to do so,' he said.

The New Yorker interview was published online after ABC News began promoting its own interview with Spanier, set to air in parts on several of its networks Wednesday and Thursday.

boys that he would 'groom' to be his victims

At the news conference, Lewis, also a former federal judge, complained that Freeh never interviewed key witnesses, ignored inconvenient facts and manipulated the truth.

For instance, he said, the report assumes former graduate assistant Mike McQueary told coach Joe Paterno in 2001 that he saw something sexual in a locker room shower and that Paterno echoed that to athletic director Tim Curley and vice president Gary Schultz. Freeh likewise, he said, assumes that they in turn told Spanier the same thing.

'Curley and Schultz have denied that they ever told Dr. Spanier anything of the sort,' Lewis said. '`Horseplay' was referred to over and over again, but never with any sexual connotation or suggestion of abuse. But Judge Freeh paid no attention to that.'

The Freeh group said Wednesday that it stands by its report.

Its investigation uncovered documents that suggest Spanier had deeper knowledge of the early Sandusky complaints, including an email in which the president appeared to agree with Curley's decision to keep a 2001 assault from child-welfare authorities and instead work directly with Sandusky and Sandusky's charity for at-risk youths.

The 'Freeh Report' also pointed a finger at legendary football coach Joe Paterno who is accused of being complicit with Spanier in ignoring Sandusky's actions

'The only downside for us is if the message isn't `heard' and acted upon, and we then become vulnerable for not having reported it,' said Spanier's email, dated Feb. 27, 2001. 'The approach you outline is humane and a reasonable way to proceed.'

Spanier's four high-profile lawyers, who are being paid by Penn State, argue that Freeh took the email out of context.

As for a 1998 report that Sandusky had showered with a boy - a complaint that led to a campus police investigation referred to county prosecutors - they note that prosecutors declined to charge Sandusky.

'There was thus nothing to conceal,' the lawyers wrote in a rebuttal to the report released Wednesday.

Spanier and Paterno were ousted in November, days after Sandusky was charged. Sandusky, who maintains his innocence, awaits sentencing.

Curley and Schultz are charged with perjury and failing to report suspected child abuse; they maintain their innocence, and their attorneys issued statements after Wednesday's broadcast also blasting the Freeh report.

Spanier's lawyers said they don't know whether he will be charged.

'That's out of our control,' lawyer Jack Riley said.

A spokesman in the attorney general's office has declined to comment on possible charges, while calling the Sandusky probe 'ongoing and active.'

University trustee Anthony Lubrano, who attended the law firm news conference, said the board has never adopted Freeh's report, unlike current university President Rodney Erickson.

'I'd love for us to come out with a statement that says, we've never accepted this report,' Lubrano said.

With Erickson's approval, the university has agreed to pay $60 million in NCAA fines over the scandal.

Spanier, who remains a tenured faculty member at Penn State, has told trustees he would never cover up abuse because he himself had been physically abused as a boy by his father, as a form of discipline.

'Someday I hope to have my name completely cleared when it becomes evident that this was unfair and untrue,' Spanier told The New Yorker.
