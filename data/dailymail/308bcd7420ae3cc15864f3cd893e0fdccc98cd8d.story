Wolves have insisted that Danny Batth is not for sale despite interest from neighbours Aston Villa.

Villa are understood to be considering a £5million offer for the 23-year-old centre-half who signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract in January. 

They are expecting bids for Holland international Ron Vlaar with Southampton keen and see Batth has a potential replacement.

Head boy: Danny Batth is vital to Wolves going forward and the club do not want to sell him

Wolves head of football operations Kevin Thelwell said: 'We’ve had no-one contacting us about Danny Batth, and neither would we welcome anyone contacting us about him.'

Wolves are hopeful of signing Rotherham United forward Kieran Agard over the weekend.
