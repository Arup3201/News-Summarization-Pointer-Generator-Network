'Shocking': Katerine Kerswell received £589,165 from Kent County Council

MORE than 450 council bigwigs have picked up six-figure pay-offs despite pressure to slash public spending.

The biggest redundancy package of the last financial year went to Kent County Council's former managing director, Katherine Kerswell, who received a staggering £589,165 after only 20 months in the role.

She lost her £200,000-a-year job at the Tory-run in December and was described as the 'architect' of a savings programme aimed at slashing 1,500 staff by 2015.

The council said Ms Kerswell had done an exceptional job' at reshaping its 'approach to service delivery' and 'recasting our overall management arrangements'.

More than £100,000 was also handed to 36 employees at Lancashire County Council, including two who walked away with £300,000, and 13 staff at Staffordshire County Council.

Golden goodbyes of more than £200,000 were given to at least 25 council workers, including one at London's poorest boroughs, Tower Hamlets, while three Glasgow City Council top brass shared packages totaling nearly £1.3m.

Development and regeneration assistant director Tommy McDonald was given £586,000, head of service development Kenneth Harkness received £425,000, and development and regeneration executive director of  Gerry Gormal picked up £288,000.

The Sunday Telegraph investigation revealed many of the officials got highly-paid jobs elsewhere in the public sector, including Andrew Kerr, who was earning £131,000 as Cardiff's chief operating officer six months after walking away from Wiltshire's chief executive post with £144,000.

Jo Williams was re-employed by Merton council in London within months of losing her £130,000-a-year job as head of housing, while former Scottish Borders council chief executive, began consultancy work with a quango just months after receiving a massive £318,000 pay-off.

Public spending: Minister Bob Neill said councils must account for casual attitude

The figures were described as 'shocking' and 'galling' by the TaxPayers' Alliance, and local government minister, Bob Neill, said: 'Councils must account for what appears to be a very casual attitude to spending public money.'

But Local Government Association spokesman, Dale Atkinson, told MailOnline: 'Councils have delivered bigger savings than almost any other part of the public sector.

'They have reduced the local government headcount by 214,000 and sliced £1.4 billion from the annual paybill.

'Ninety per cent of councils have also lowered senior staff costs.

'There are inevitable short-term costs associated with restructuring on this scale but the overall savings to the public are significant and ongoing.

'Councils will always meet the legal requirements in relation to redundancies'
