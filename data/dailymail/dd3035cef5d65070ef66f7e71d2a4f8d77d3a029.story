In a stadium full of cheering football fans, it was classical opera quartet Amore's job to grab the crowd's attention with their performance of the FA hymn 'Abide With Me'.

And one member clearly aimed to do that, with her dress split to the navel and baring her cleavage.

Soprana Monica McGhee, a member of quartet Amore who kicked off the FA Cup Final match today between Wigan Athletic and Manchester City, chose to perform the song in a risque cream ruffled dress.

The camera focused on Monica McGhee, member of Amore, a little bit too long as the band performed

Grabbing the crowd's attention: The ruffled dress was an eye-catching addition to the ensemble's outfits

Amore had Tweeted about how excited they were to perform with the orchestra, and to the fans

With her cleavage on show the camera chose to linger on the Royal College of Music graduate as she and her bandmates performed the hymn at Wembley stadium this afternoon.

Her other bandmates mezzo soprano Victoria Gray chose a strapless - but more demure - blue floor-length gown, while bariton Peter Braithwaite and tenor David Webb chose smart suits and Dune shoes.

The camera swept over all of them - but seemed to focus intently on a side shot of Ms McGhee, highlighting how low-cut her dress' neckline.

One Twitter user, called Chris Guy, referred: 'Highlight so far the side on view of one of the opera singers during 'Abide With Me'.

On their official Twitter, the band were clearly pleased with their looks though.

Despite their energetic performance, the quartet drew criticism from viewers - some who despised the operatic style of singing, and others who just wanted the crowd to sing

They wrote: 'Huge love to the amazing
 team @lockonego & @jonnylockonego for making us glam for FA Cup 
Final! #Wembley #buzzing XxX'.

But despite her attention-grabbing outfit, the quartet drew many comments for all the wrong reasons.

Many fans took to Twitter to complain about how the hymn 'completely ruined by those operatic style singers!'.

User Colin Murray said: 'Abide with me? Okay, but only if you allow me to wear earplugs. It's meant to be simple and poignant, not layered.'

Another, under the name of Anthony Hamilton, said: 'Abide With Me normally an FA Cup highlight. That sounded like a fire in a pet shop.'

One user called dangerhere referred to one of the member's brightly-patterned suit jacket, saying: 'Murdering Abide With Me with histrionics and that jacket. Shameful.'

Twitter users vented their disappointment at the rendition of the song by the band

There was a host of criticism about the performance, despite the band's enthusiastic version of the song

Amore are signed to Warner Music Entertainment label and have made a debut album with the Grammy winning producer and arranger, Simon Franglen.

On her website's biography page, Ms McGhee said: ''Singing this kind of music is really daunting as it requires such precision and hard work but it is completely worth it.

'We love communicating with audiences and sharing the great stories of operas.

'We are all still working on our voices everyday as we know we never stop learning-the singers we look up to are the ones who are constantly bettering themselves and bring the most moving performances to audiences!'
