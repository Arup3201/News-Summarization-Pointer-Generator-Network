An elderly Miami woman was riding her bicycle Saturday afternoon when she was viciously attacked and mauled by four pit bulls.

Maria Sanchez, 67, says if it were not for her four 'angels' - Good Samaritans who came to her aid - she would have been killed on the spot by the dogs.

The victim was rushed to Kendall Hospital with chunks of flesh missing from her lip, nose and feet. On Tuesday, Ms Sanchez underwent surgery but her doctors say they may have to amputate one of her chewed-up toes.

Scarred but alive: Maria Sanchez, 67, was left with chunks of flesh missing from her lip, nose and feet after an encounter with four pit bulls in Miami

Four-legged bandits: These animals attacked Ms Sanchez and began tearing at her

Speaking from her hospital bed Tuesday, the heavily bandaged, scarred 67-year-old woman recalled to NBC6 how she was biking in the Cutler Bay section of Miami Saturday afternoon when she spotted a pack of dogs eying her.

‘It’s not like, “Oh, little puppies.” No, I knew they were going to kill me the minute I saw them,’ Sanchez said. ‘I looked at them; I knew they were going to get me.’

The animals, identified by the Miami-Dade Animal Services as pit bulls, lunged at Sanchez, knocked her to the ground, and then proceeded to tear at her body.

Four neighbors, among them John Green, overheard the woman's desperate cries for help and ran over to chase away the animals.

'They were eating this lady up, you know,' said Green, who came unarmed but tried to distract the out-of-control canines.

The other three Good Samaritans came at the dogs with baseball bats, but the pit bulls continued biting her ever as they were being struck.

Police officers who responded to the scene determined that the four dogs escaped from a house in Cutler Bay.

When investigators came up to the residence, they allegedly detected marijuana odor coming from the inside. A search of the premises yielded several pot plants.

Law enforcement officials arrested Angel Gonzalez and Veronica Sanders on drug charges. The couple also received a citation for keeping pit bulls in violation of a Miami-Dade County ordinance.

The four-legged ringleader of the dog pack who did most of the biting was euthanized, while the other three will be put up for adoption outside the county.
