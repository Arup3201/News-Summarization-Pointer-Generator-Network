The president of Ukraine could still sign an agreement with the EU despite insisting he wanted to seek closer ties with Russia instead last month.

EU diplomat Baroness Ashton has been in talks with Victor Yanukovich following his decision to reject the pact which resulted in angry protests on the country's streets and claims that she received his assurances during a visit to Kiev.

Lady Ashton claims that Yanukovich still intends on signing an agreement that would bring Ukraine closer to the EU but that short term financial issues need to be resolved beforehand.

She hinted that the country's economic
problems 'can be addressed by the support that not only comes from the 
EU institutions, but actually by showing that he has a serious economic 
plan in signing the agreement'.

Her
claims come after weeks of fierce protestors from thousands of 
demonstrators who oppose embattled Yanukovich's apparent pro-Russian 
sympathies.

Demonstrators clashed with police on Tuesday night in Kiev as Ukranian police tried to put an end to a stand off.

Ukraine's tough tactics against the protestors led to US Secretary of State John Kerry voicing his 'disgust' and threatening sanctions against the county.

While Lady Ashton remained positive that an EU trade deal was still on the cards, Russian President Vladimir Putin used a national address to convey his interest in maintaining a close relationship with Ukraine.

Following Tuesday's failed attempt to crush pro-European demonstrators, the crisis appears to be reaching boiling point with US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel attempting to gain reassurances from the Ukranian Government that the armed forces would not be brought in to tackle protests.

Ukranian Defence Secretary Pavlo Lebedyev said that the President is against the use of the armed forces despite Tuesday's crackdown angering even more civilians.

President Yanukovich added that his government would never use force against peaceful protestors.

He urged demonstrators to sit down for talks.
