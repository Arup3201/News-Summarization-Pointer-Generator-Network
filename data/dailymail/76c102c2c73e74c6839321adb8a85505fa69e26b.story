Hero: Shakil Afridi, the doctor who helped the CIA track down Osama bin Laden, claims he is being held in total isolation in Pakistan's Peshawar prison

The heroic doctor who helped the United States pinpoint the location of Al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden has been held in complete isolation in a Pakistani prison since September 2012 - without access to lawyers or family - as he waits for a court to decide his future, according to a letter smuggled out of the country by a supporter.

Shakil Afridi, 49 - who worked with the CIA on a fake vaccination operation to confirm the presence of bin Laden in an Abbottobad compound, resulting in the fateful May 2011 SEAL mission that killed the terrorist mastermind - is regarded as a hero in the US but has been tried as a traitor in Pakistan.

Originally sentenced by a court in a remote tribal area to 33 years jail for 'conspiring against the state', he now awaits a new verdict to be handed down on Dec. 18 on whether he will serve out the term or be granted a retrial.

But, according to a one-and-a half page handwritten letter smuggled out of Peshawar prison, Afridi says he is being denied basic rights at a time that is crucial.

'My legal right to consult with my lawyers is being denied,' he wrote in the letter.

'What sort of justice system is this?'

The authenticity of the letter - obtained by Fox News - has been verified by Afridi's cousin, Qamar Nadeem, who used previous correspondence to match the handwriting.

Nadeem said the letter, written in the Hindustani language Urdu, also referred to the 'mental torture' the physician is forced to face with on a daily basis.

Afridi was arrested soon after the unilateral raid by US commandos that killed Bin Laden.

While he was arrested for running the fake vaccine operation, his 33-year sentence was for allegedly being a member of militant terror group Lashkar-e-Islam, which he has vehemently denied.

Pinpointed: Afridi ran a vaccination program for the CIA to collect DNA in an attempt to verify Bin Laden's presence at a compound in the town of Abbottabad (pictured), prior to the U.S. raid that killed him in 2011

The sentence was widely seen as punishment for assisting the United States in the capture and kill of Bin Laden, which came at a major international embarrassment to Pakistan.

Dead: Osama bin Laden was killed during a covert US mission to Pakistan in May 2011

In the almost-10 years between the 9/11 attacks in 2001 and the mission, the country continually said it was not plausible for the Al Qaeda leader to be hiding in Pakistan, only for him to be located in one of their most affluent towns.

The operation subsequently lead to suspicions Pakistan were harboring Bin Laden.

In August, Afridi's conviction was overturned, with a court citing procedural errors and ordering a retrial.

However the judge that overturned the sentence soon died in a suspicious gas explosion at his Islamabad apartment.

The trail court has since to grant the new trail and, as the final nears, local authorities have gathered a host of other charges together in an attempt to keep Afridi imprisoned if the terrorist charges are dropped.

One is the 'murder' of a teenage boy, who died after the doctor performed surgery on him for appendicitis in 2006.

A three-member tribunal, which operates under the archaic tribal law system, heard arguments on the merits of a new trial at a court in Peshawar on Monday. 

The tribunal’s decision, which could force local authorities to launch a new trial, is expected to be handed down on Dec. 18.

Behind bars: Afridi has remained jailed in Peshawar Central Jail (pictured in this file photo) since 2011. In a new letter smuggled out of the prison, the physician writes he has been denied access to his lawyers and family since September 2012

'We are confident that Dr. Shakeel Afridi would be freed after a free and fair trial,' said Afridi’s lawyer, Samiullah Afridi.

But others from the defense team feel the case has been crafted on political rather legal grounds and a favorable verdict is unlikely.

Another of Afridi’s lawyers fears the letter going public could hurt the doctor’s bid for freedom.
