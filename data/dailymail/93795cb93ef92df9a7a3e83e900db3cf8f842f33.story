A 23-year-old woman has spent an astonishing £10,000 on new clothes because she doesn't want to be seen wearing the same thing twice online.

Rachael Adams from Essex, says that after being tagged on Facebook or Instagram in a new dress, she will then banish it to the back of her wardrobe.

The personal assistant has admitted she's splurged a small mortgage on an array of party outfits so she can keep up appearances on social media.

'It's social media's fault,' Rachael says. 'You know other people will notice if you wear the same thing twice and you don't want to be seen as boring.

'It would just be so embarrassing to be seen in the same dress again. I'm usually tagged in about 80 pictures after a night out so it's really obvious.'

She goes out at least twice a month and buying a new outfit each time has cost her over £10,000 in six years.

Rachael says: 'I notice if my friends or people on Facebook and Instagram do it and I wouldn't slag them off. But it is frowned upon.'

The party girl will happily pay up to £70 for a brand-new dress - which she will wear just once.

'If it's a birthday or special occasion I buy something a bit more special,' she admits. 'I go on at least two big nights out a month, so I need to buy two new outfits.'

When Rachael was younger, she didn't feel under so much pressure.

'I wasn't too bothered, Facebook and Instagram wasn't as big when I was at high school,' she explains.

But when she started going out aged 17, she felt she needed to shop for a new outfit for each new occasion.

Sometimes for a spur of the moment night with the girls, she'll reluctantly wear something old.

'I really try not to do it, but if that happens, I'll ban any pictures,' Rachael says. 'All my friends are the same. 

'If I do have to dig out something I've worn before I always confess because I know they'll notice.'

Her boyfriend of two years, Luke Tappin, doesn't have the same problem. 'He thinks it's such a waste of money, he's got suits and blazers that he wears over and over again,' Rachael says.

 'It's more of a girl thing, we're a lot more judgemental.'

Rachael has to clear out her bulging wardrobe three times a year, selling clothing on eBay, at boot sales and by donating to charity shops.

'If I really love something, I might keep it but I wouldn't wear it again,' she says. 'Most things I get rid of after a few months to make space for my new stuff.'

She's already planning for the festive season.

'I've worked out I'll need to buy nine new outfits for girls' nights as well as work parties and family get togethers. 

'For New Year's Eve and Christmas Eve, I'll definitely be spending more. It'll be about £500 in total on new clothes.'

Rachael's now joined forces with Oxfam to encourage more women to donate their barely worn clothes to its charity shops.

She says: 'When they've only been worn once, they're just going to waste so you can make space in your wardrobe and help charity at the same time.'

A survey carried out by Oxfam has revealed an astonishing 67 per cent of 18 to 24 year olds feel the same as Rachael.

Thousands of women are suffering from so-called 'Outfit Repetition Syndrome'. Out of the 2,000 women surveyed, 46 per cent said they wouldn't wear their favourite party outfits more than five times. 

Women in the Midlands are the most prone to ORS, with the East and West Midlands taking the top two spots of being the most concerned about outfit repetition online.

Scottish ladies meanwhile remained largely unfazed. East and West Midlands also topped the poll of women who re-use their staple party outfits the least and are the most eager to find something unique at an affordable price.

A spokesperperson for Oxfam said: 'The days of the staple party dress are officially over. As social media usage increases, so does ORS.'

Fee Gilfeather, of Oxfam Trading added: 'Bring in your overexposed but hardly worn party outfits to an Oxfam shop, and make your new selection from somebody else's pre-loved style. 

'It's the low-cost, feel good way to create a unique party look. Then you can be the star of the ball, as well as the social media wall!'
