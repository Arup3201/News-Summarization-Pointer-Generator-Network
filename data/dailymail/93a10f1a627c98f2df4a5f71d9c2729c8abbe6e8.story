An avalanche killed five Saturday, some 12,000 feet high in Colorado’s rugged Rocky Mountain back country.

The snowboarders were found dead  after becoming trapped in Colorado’s White River National Forest.

Authorities believe it was the snowboarders, themselves, who triggered the avalanche that occurred around 1pm.

Only one member of the back country snowboarding group survived the tragedy on Loveland Pass, which juts to over two miles above sea level.

Clear Creek County Sheriff Don Krueger said in a statement that six snowboarders were caught in the slide, but did not release the condition of the lone survivor.

The Colorado Department of Transportation closed a highway as many skiers were headed home from nearby Arapahoe Basin ski resort.

Lisa Clarke Devore, who was headed back to Denver from the resort, told The Associated Press she saw a fire truck and ambulance on the pass, as well two search dogs headed into the area of the slide.

She says she saw several ambulances, including one towing snowmobiles, headed toward the pass.

On Thursday, a 38-year-old snowboarder died in an avalanche south of Vail Pass. Eagle County sheriff's officials said the man and another snowboarder likely triggered the slide after a friend on a snowmobile dropped them off at the top of Avalanche Bowl.

Nationwide, more than 18 people have died in avalanches this season, according to the Colorado Avalanche Information Center.

U.S. avalanche deaths climbed steeply around 1990 to an average of around 24 a year as new gear became available for back country travel.

Until then, avalanches rarely claimed more than a handful of lives each season in records going back to 1950.
