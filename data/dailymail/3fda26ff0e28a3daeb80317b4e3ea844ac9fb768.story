The world's most technologically advanced bin being trialled with a London council that thinks despite its hefty price tag, it could save them money

The world's most  technologically advanced bin has gone on trial, with a London council believing that despite its hefty price tag, it could save them money.

The BigBelly Solar bin harvests energy from the sun and uses it to compact waste to an eight of its size.

The cost of leasing the high-tech bin is an eye-watering £1,000 a year when leased for five years but because of its huge capacity, it could save councils money in vehicle journeys and fuel to collect waste.

The solar-powered unit runs on a 12v battery.

It needs just eight hours of sunlight per month to function as intended and is currently on trial in Merton, south west London.

According to the distributors of the BigBelly Solar bins, Kyron Energy & Power, the compactor technology increases the capacity six to eight times that of a normal street bin.

Consequently the company says the bin has been proven to reduce the number of waste collections needed by 86 per cent.

Each compactor comes equipped with a wireless monitoring system.

This enables the refuse collection teams to view fullness of each bin on computers and smart phones. 

The system sends a text or email when the bin is 85 per cent full and in need of emptying. 

The cost of leasing the high-tech bin is an eye-watering £1,000 a year when leased for five years but because of its huge capacity, it could save councils like Merton money in vehicle journeys and fuel to collect waste

Merton council invested in 30 bins and if the year-long pilot is successful, it predicts savings of £15,000 per year could be made on expenditures such as vehicle journeys and fuel costs. 

Merton Council cabinet member for performance and implementation, Councillor Mark Betteridge said: 'These new bins are great and a fantastic example of Merton’s business-like approach to running our services.

'Not only will they assist in keeping our parks clean, they should also help us be more efficient, delivering better value for our residents.

'We want to see local people and their families out and about in our parks this summer. There’s so much to enjoy from paddling pools to great play areas, walks and picnics - there’s something for everyone.'

The system sends a text or email when the bin is 85 per cent full and in need of emptying and the information (pictured) helps customers reduce collection and disposal costs by 70 per cent, if the number of collections, staffing and fuel costs are taken into account

Two bins will be placed in Wimbledon Park, while Dundonald Rec, Sir Joseph Hood, Colliers Wood and South Park will each get one.

The company also makes recycling bins that are used by many councils.

Just like the compactor bins, the recycling units send details about real-time fill levels to computers and smartphones, to eliminate 'milk-round collection rounds.

The company said its products reduce collection and disposal cost for its customers by 70 per cent, if the number of collections, staffing and fuel costs are taken into account.
