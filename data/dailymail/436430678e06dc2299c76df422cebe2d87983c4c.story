Back in July, Ronald Koeman tweeted a photo of training at Southampton. There were cones meticulously laid out, a pristine grass pitch and footballs at the ready. Just one thing was missing: players.

It seemed like a caustic comment on the state of affairs he had inherited at the club. At that time £170million worth of talent was being sold; no one had come in. It didn’t bode terribly well.

‘I didn’t mean it that way!’ insists the Southampton manager, now linked with Barcelona and facing his one-time mentor and former friend Louis van Gaal at Manchester United. ‘It was not a message that we don’t have players. Other people took that decision to say that. If it was a joke, I would be the first to say it was a joke but it wasn’t. Seriously.’

While it is undoubtedly true that all around sensed chaos and crisis at Southampton, he had sufficient self-belief to convince onlookers that the club could have a good season, though he does have the good grace to admit he is surprised to be in a Champions League spot with more than half the season gone

‘No, I didn’t expect this,’ he concedes. ‘In that time, players were a little bit afraid about the situation but that’s normal. Because if you are like Jose Fonte, you are the captain of the team and you see four, five or six players out of the dressing room, signing for other clubs, of course you have reasons to be afraid.

‘My job was to calm that and to talk to the players and to give them the confidence that when we start the season, we will have a good team to continue what they did last season.’

Their progress since then has been stunning. Only Manchester City and Chelsea had scored more goals prior to this weekend’s games and they have the best defensive record, with just 15 goals conceded. Van Gaal, Arsene Wenger, Brendan Rodgers and Roberto Martinez would all crave a record like that.

In the circumstances perhaps it’s no surprise that Koeman gives short shrift to those managers who say they need time to adapt to new circumstances.

‘It’s an easy answer as a manager to say, “I need time”. You don’t have time in football. I think sometimes they are more excuses of the people than to expect something.’

Mangers like Louis van Gaal who need more time are just making excuses, according to Koeman

Easy to say, of course, when you win 11 of your first 14 games in the Premier League; not so easy for Van Gaal, who won three of his first 11 and has spent much of the first half of the season saying that it will take time for players to adapt to his ideas. 

‘Maybe he is different to other managers but I don’t believe in football that you need two years or one year. It’s all about qualities of the players. And the better the players, the easier it is for the manager.’

Once friends, Koeman and Van Gaal fell out while working at Ajax together. Now Koeman hopes to upset the older man again by guiding his Saints into the Champions League.

He says: ‘Games like Man United are good tests to see if the players believe in the qualities of the team and if we can reach that kind of position in the table.’
