Recent killings by an unidentified croc slayer in the Northern Territory, who's gone as far as skinning and beheading saltwater crocodiles, has sparked deep concerns among wildlife and conservation groups.

One crocodile was recently found at Dundee Beach, southwest of Darwin, which is where a previous two  were brutally mutilated earlier in the month.

A crocodile conservationist says such incidents have 'gone on forever' in the Northern Territory but are now distressingly on the rise.

Mr Edlund says it is illegal to kill protected wildlife, which include crocodiles, with the maximum penalty being a $74,500 fine or five years behind bars

While it is unknown whether the suspected croc killer is working alone or with others, it is believed a fisherman could be responsible for the recent murders of saltwater crocodiles in the area.

NT Parks and Wildlife spokesman Edwin Edlund says he is 'disturbed' by the recent killings.

'It is more likely there has been human involvement in these recent incidents,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'If it is the same person who is doing this multiple times, who knows when the next incident will be.'

Mr Edlund says it is illegal to kill protected wildlife, which include crocodiles, with the maximum penalty being a $74,500 fine or five years behind bars.

Mr Edlund says he receives about 10 reports of such incidents each year, most of which involve firearms.

However he says there are no official reports issued by those who found the dead animals on the beach and urged them to come forward.

'We heavily rely on the public to come forward with evidence and report these incidents,' he said.

'So it's very hard for us to pursue any inquiries without reports.' 

Mr Edlund urged anyone with information to call NT Parks and Wildlife on 0419 822 859 or NT Police on 131 444

The spokeswoman for NT Crocodile Conservation and Protection Society told Daily Mail Australia she was 'disgusted' by the latest killings and believes the culprit could be a fisherman.

Broady, who only revealed her first name, says residents and passers-by have been sending her images of the 'brutal and inhumane' incidents.

The most recent being Rachel Maddox who told Broady she discovered the croc on Friday.

'This has gone on forever in the Northern Territory and it's only just getting exposed,' Broady said.

'It happens all the time and it's increasing. It's so unregulated here, it's ridiculous. 

'Crocodiles are a protected species but no one cares.

'If this happened to a koala, the country would be livid.'

Mr Edlund urged anyone with information to call NT Parks and Wildlife on 0419 822 859 or NT Police on 131 444.
