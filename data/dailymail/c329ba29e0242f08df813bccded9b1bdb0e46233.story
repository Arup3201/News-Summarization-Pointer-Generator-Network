Yawning as it huddled in the undergrowth on a rainy day in Rwanda, this dejected looking gorilla decided there was nothing for it but to settle back for a snooze.

The mighty mountain gorilla was captured appearing to sulk as it took shelter from the drizzle amid the vegetation in the Virunga Mountains.

Perhaps the silverback had a touch of the bad weather blues - the region sees more than 70inches of rainfall every year.

Fed-up: The grumpy looking gorilla was captured yawning as it sat amid the foliage in Rwanda's Virunga Mountains

The gorilla was spotted hunched in the foliage yawning, before eventually nestling down for a nap.

The fur of a mountain gorilla is often longer and thicker than other gorilla species, enabling them to live in areas with cooler temperatures.

But a thick coat appeared to be of little comfort to this silverback, which was seen wrapping its furry arms around itself in the damp greenery.

Nearly half of the worldâ€™s estimated 700 critically endangered mountain gorillas live in the Virunga Mountains region, which is situated at the intersection of Uganda, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
