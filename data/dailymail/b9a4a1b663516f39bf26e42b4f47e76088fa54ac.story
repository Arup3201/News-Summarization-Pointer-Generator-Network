At first glance, this breathtaking shot looks like two brightly coloured flowers pictured next to each other.

In fact, the photo is of a flower and a beautifully coloured hummingbird hovering beside it.

With its wings outstretched, at first glance it's almost impossible to tell the little bird is different from the flower. The only give-away is its small, thin, bill that peaks through its wings.

The picture appears to be of two flowers, but one is a brightly coloured hummingbird hovering in the air

The brightly coloured hummingbird was photographed sweeping down onto the pink flower so it could feed off its nectar.

But while feeding peacefully, another bird invades and tries to get some of the nectar. After a few moments as the two birds sized each other up, the intruder decided to leave.

The spectacular photos were taken by photographer Florian Kuster on the slopes of a volcano in Costa Rica.

Mr Kuster visited the Poas Volcano National Park, which is home to the volcano, to scout for locations good enough for his photo tours.

The 32-year-old, who is from Switzerland but lives in Costa Rica, drove for an hour on a narrow mountain road before finding the hummingbirds.

He said: 'I went there for location scouting for my photography workshops. I drove for one hour on a bumpy, narrow mountain pass.

'I enjoyed a beautiful landscape and cold winds at the highest elevation, rain and heavy clouds are guests all year round and give the region a mystic atmosphere.

'Rufous-tailed hummingbirds are about 10cm from bill to tail. The flower about the size of a small honeydew melon.

After hovering above it for some time, the hummingbird lands on the flower to try and look for nectar

It then starts digging through the flower petals to try and find some food. The birds can consume up to twice their body weight in nectar every day

Before long, it is interrupted by a second hummingbird which hopes to join in the feast

The two birds then have a brief confrontation as they fight over the rights to the flower's nectar

After the brief spat, the intruder decides to leave and the first hummingbird returns to its mealÂ 

'Being from Switzerland I was not familiar with hummingbirds until my first journey to the American continent.

'Since then I was fascinated by this little helicopters designed by nature. Their ability to stand still in the air and accelerate within a blink of an eye to 100km/h is aviational design in it's perfection.

'I like the pictures because of their colours and its unusual pose.

'Most hummingbird pictures are with the bird sipping nectar and the wings backwards while the hummer hovers in an upright position.

'But the bird seemed to hug the flower.

'Even though the flower is disproportional to the bird, the picture looks balanced. I like the small details which my camera was able to capture.'

He added that the birds were not shy and he managed to get four metres away from them whilst they battled over the flower.

He said: 'The gardens are full of hummingbirds due to hummingbird feeders. When this happens there is competition between them.

'So even if it looks like a ballet in the air, they were most probably fighting for the food source.

'After their 'dance', the coppery-headed emerald took off and left the field.
