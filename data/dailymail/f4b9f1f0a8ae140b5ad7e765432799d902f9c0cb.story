The British Army will be reduced to a ‘largely ceremonial’ rump if the Tories are allowed to push ahead with their planned spending cuts, Business Secretary Vince Cable said this morning.

The Liberal Democrat Cabinet minister said George Osborne’s plan to balance the books would be ‘devastating’ for public services.

He accused the Chancellor of ‘veering off to extreme ideology’ with the general election less than five months away.

It comes as the independent Office for Budget Responsibility predicted the public sector would have to shrink to a size not seen since the 1930s to hit the Chancellor's budget deficit forecasts.

Mr Cable said the Tories had been ‘let off the leash’ and were becoming ‘extreme’.

The intervention comes after a poll showed voters now saw the Tories as more right wing than UKIP. 

Referring to the poll, Mr Cable said: ‘This is what happens when you remove the restraints we put on them in Coalition government.’

He told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show that he would be ‘really worried’ if the Conservatives were able implement the cuts outlined after winning the next election.

The Business Secretary said: ‘There’s a table in the Autumn Statement which suggests that if those plans were realised we would roughly halve the total spending on the Home Office, i.e., the police, on the defence services, which would become largely ceremonial.

‘We would be almost halving the spending of local governments on areas like social care, let alone all the things that I and my colleagues are doing around training and science. It would be devastating and it would be ideologically-driven and I would be very strongly opposed to it.’

Mr Cable, one of the most common critics of the Conservatives from inside Government, said there are ‘big differences’ in the way the Liberal Democrats wanted to cut the deficit compared to the Tories.

He said Mr Osborne's plan ‘destroys public services in the way we do them’, adding that ‘just continuing’ cuts ‘on ideological extreme grounds is very, very foolish’.

Mr Cable did not rule out another power-sharing deal with the Conservatives if, as widely expected, the general election fails to deliver any party an overall Commons majority, and said there remained ‘a lot of common ground’ between them.

But he pointed to a poll showing voters - especially Tories themselves - considered the party to be further to the political right than Ukip as evidence of a major lurch to more extreme positions.

‘While we have been in coalition we have kept the Tories on quite a tight leash and they have been well behaved,’ he said.

‘Now they have been let off the leash and confronting the possibility of majority government we are getting into all kinds of extremes.

‘This is what happens when they are removed from the constraints we put on them in coalition.’
