Dale Bolinger, 57, is alleged to have told police he had fantasies about eating kindergarten staff at the age of six

A male nurse accused of arranging to meet a 14-year-old girl he planned to have sex with, behead and eat started having fantasies about cannibalism at the age of six, a court has heard.

Dale Bolinger, 57, formerly of Canterbury, Kent, is said to have told police fantasied about taking kindergarten staff in to the kitchen and eating them when he was a child.

Prosecutor Martin Yale told the court the male nurse made the confession when he was first arrested in February last year for attempting to sexually groom a girl under the age of 16.

Bolinger is on trial at Canterbury Crown Court accused of arranging to meet with a girl, 14, that he met online on a site called the Dark Fetish Network (DFN).

It is alleged he planned to meet up with the girl - known by her online profile name Eva Gonza - at Ashford International station before taking her to his home to have sex with her.

He then planned to behead her with an axe and eat her, it is claimed.

Reading Bolinger's police interview to the court, Mr Yale said: 'By the time I got to 14, I turned into the villain of the piece and I wondered what it would be like to eat a girl.

Bolinger, who worked at the Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Hospital in Margate, Kent,  also blamed his 'very domineering' mother for his behaviour which he described as 'weird' and 'very strange', the jury was told.

He told police he had never discussed his fantasies with his wife Rosemary or his son Rick and said he felt ashamed, the court heard.

He told police: 'It was less to do with sexual gratification and more to do with anger.

'The people that do it (cannibalism) are seriously deranged, and I may be many things but I am not deranged.'

Prosector Mr Yale said Bolinger described his cannibalism fantasy as 'Jekyll and Hyde' but not something he could fulfil as he would never harm anyone.

Bolinger said in interview: 'I think it was more to do with disliking my mother more than hating women.'

He told police he had been brought up in a military household because his father was in the US Air Force and he had been suppressed as a child.

Bolinger is said to have told police 
that his mother had also made a drunken pass at him when he was 15, 
which had left him 'shocked'.

He said he had been emotionally absent from his son, the way his father had been with him, the court heard.

Bolinger is said to have told police his cannibalism was 'less to do with sexual gratification and more to do with anger' during an police interview conducted when he was first arrested in February last year

He
 told police he had had online chats with a girl he believed was 14 and 
called Eva, who wished to be decapitated, the court heard.

Bolinger
 claimed he was so concerned by their conversation that he believed the 
girl to be at risk, which is why he travelled to Ashford International 
station in Kent to meet her, it is alleged.

Mr Yale said Bolinger told police: 'At no time have I ever killed, kidnapped, taken or eaten a person.'

The
 court heard that Bolinger told the police he had bought the axe from 
Homebase to remove two tree stumps from the side of his house.

He admitted in interview that the discs found in his home which 
contained indecent images of children were his, the jury heard.

When
 questioned about the images, Bolinger told police: 'I do not find 
children sexually attractive but I do find them interesting as a food 
source.'

Paul Jarvis, 
defending Bolinger, said: 'There is not a single piece of evidence from 
the family home to say that anyone met their death there or has been 
consumed at the property.'

He asked Bolinger whether he had ever killed anybody, eaten human flesh or sexually assaulted a child.

He said: 'Have you ever attempted to do any of those things?'

'I do not find 
children sexually attractive but I do find them interesting as a food 
source.'

Bolinger replied: 'No, not in reality, just in fantasy.'

He
 told the court he had previously been married for about 34 years and 
that he and his wife had four children, including a boy called Martin 
who had died before the age of one.

Mr Jarvis asked him: 'When did your interest in the sorts of things we have been hearing about begin?'

Bolinger said: 'Probably with puberty but before that it was me saving other children.

'When I first started school I had a fantasy about children being stolen and cooked and I would save them. That changed around puberty.'

He also told the court he had found the DFN website through another website which contained cartoons of cannibalism.

Bolinger told the court he had visited the DFN website out of curiosity and that the people he spoke to seemed to be 'willing to accept anything'.

He said: 'I wanted to get them to the point where they said "surely this is fantasy?"'

He claimed he would say things to try to shock the people he was chatting to and that he did not believe that Eva was a 14-year-old girl.

The male nurse is on trial accused of grooming an underage girl for sex. It is alleged he planned to meet up with a girl, 14, that he wanted to sleep with, behead and eat at Ashford International station, pictured

He told the jury: 'Initially, I was looking to find people with like minds and to see where they came from, but it soon spiralled down into trying to shock people enough that they would ask "is this fantasy?"'

Mr Jarvis asked Bolinger what he got out of the chat groups.

Bolinger replied: 'I think it goes back to the feeling of power. When you have people trolling others I always think that they are trying to get some sort of power.

'They are trying to get a rise out of someone, and I am ashamed to say that is what I was trying to do.'

Asked what sort of a buzz he got from the chats, he said: "My buzz on it is non-terminal, biting, licking, that sort of thing.

'The idea of killing, eating someone, no.'

He told the court he was there to work with people's fantasies but that he had taken it to the extreme.

Mr Jarvis asked Bolinger whether he would ever decapitate someone in reality.

Bolinger said: 'No, not only would you be killing somebody but the mess would be quiet incredible.'

Mr Jarvis said: 'Why did you buy the axe?'

'At no time have I ever killed, kidnapped, taken or eaten a person.'

Bolinger replied: 'Initially, I had been thinking about buying one, secondly they were on sale, and thirdly, she (Eva) said she would not come unless I bought one.'

He told the court his concern for her safety was the only reason he had gone to meet her at Ashford International station and that he 'probably would have wet himself' if she had turned up, but that he would have called social services and the police.

Bolinger was also asked about administering a poison or a noxious substance to his friend Urlene King after he put a cloth soaked in dry cleaning fluid over her mouth in July 2010 - a charge he pleaded guilty to in February this year.

He told the court he had loved her and had sexual feelings for her and that he had made this known but Miss King had not really made her feelings towards him clear.

He said they had been shopping, bought some fish and returned to his home.

As he went to wash his hands he saw some gauze and the dry cleaning fluid and put it over her mouth.

He said: 'I was intending to put it over her face. Why I was intending to put it over her face; I don't really remember it.

'I was watching myself from above. I was not aware; I could not feel any emotion or anything.

'Was I living out one of these fantasies? No. Was it to kill her? No. Was it to rape her? No.

'Why I was doing it I am not too sure. I cannot really give an adequate answer.'

The trial was adjourned until 10am on Friday when Bolinger will be cross-examined by the prosecution.
