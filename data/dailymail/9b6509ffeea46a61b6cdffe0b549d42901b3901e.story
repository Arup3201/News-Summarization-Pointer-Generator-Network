From a hungry-looking tortoiseshell inspecting the wares at a fish market in Valparaiso in Chile to a tiny black kitten snapped in the Swedish city of Gothenburg, no cat is too small to escape the attention of photographer Jesse Hunter.

Now the fruits of the animal lover's travels have been turned into a new book, All The Cats In The World, which brings together snaps of pets taken in 44 different countries.

Among them are the sleepy street cats of Morocco, pampered pets living the high life in the US and the daring felines who call the abandoned rocky city of Petra in Jordan home.

'The country with the most cats that I encountered was colourful Morocco, followed closely by Greece,' explains Hunter in the foreword to the book.

'I photographed hundreds of felines during our journey - and a lot of these can be seen on the cover of the book.

He added: 'I love stalking these intriguingly curious animals.'

His travels, which began in 2010 and lasted for more than two years, took in more than 44 countries across six continents, among them the US, Denmark, Turkey and Australia.

The quirky tome that resulted includes shots of adorable pets fast asleep on doorsteps in Greece, a cat getting a cuddle in Danish capital Copenhagen and a colony of ginger felines living in Turkey.

Hunter's journeys have also resulted in other books: All the Happiness in the World, which depicts smiling faces from all over the globe, and All the Love in the World, which shows happy couples.

'Thank you kitties of the world for being the most intriguing and playful posers,' he added. 'You will forever fascinate me.'
