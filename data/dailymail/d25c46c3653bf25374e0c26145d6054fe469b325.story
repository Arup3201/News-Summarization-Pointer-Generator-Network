A brave young boy who has been given just weeks to live by doctors has taken over the reins of Collingwood Football Club, as he ticked off another huge 'bucket list' wish.

Four-year-old Peter Gourlay, who has terminal cancer, ousted Eddie McGuire as the Melbourne club's president on Thursday.

And he achieved his Magpie mission with his twin brother Daniel by his side.

In charge: Eddie McGuire handed over the reins to Collingwood to Peter Gourlay on Thursday

The pair got to meet their favourite player, Jesse White, who released black and white balloons into the sky with the boys.

Peter has been battling neuroblastoma cancer since he was just 18-months-old and his mother Meredith is determined to help him realise some of his dreams.

He will turn five on July 13 but doctors say he's unlikely to make that birthday.

He cheekily blew raspberries and joked 'did you hear that?' as he was shown the club's grounds.

His mother told Channel 7 news: 'In time, we can look back and say these were the good times.'

She said the hardest part when Peter leaves is that she will still be celebrating his twin Daniel's birthday and will 'every year remember how precious Peter was'.

'It's heart breaking but the one thing you hope to do as a football club and as a community, is just give a little bit of brightness at a dark time in peoples' lives,' said Eddie McGuire.

The TV star has been the boss of the AFL club, based in the Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Precinct in Melbourne, since 1998 and doesn't usually hand over his chairman's badge.

Earlier this week, Mr McGuire heard an interview on 3AW Mornings with Peter's mother Meredith and said he felt compelled to offer the boy opportunity to run his favourite club for a day.

He gave Peter the president's badge proudly and the little boy beamed.

Meredith told 3AW: 'It's good to give them the memories because even though Peter may leave this world, his twin brother is going to feel it for the rest of his life.

'At least he's going to have something that's absolutely precious to hold on to.

'His pain is increasing (but he says) he's not ready for hospital.'

The young boy has already ticked a balloon ride and magic show off his bucket list and will spend the morning at high school on Friday.
