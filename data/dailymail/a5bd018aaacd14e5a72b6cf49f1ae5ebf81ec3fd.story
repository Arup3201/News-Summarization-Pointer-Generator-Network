The 67-year-old sex-line worker known as Gloria, whose story of desperate measures made Australia's prime minister wink, has finally responded to the controversial incident.

The Melbourne grandmother whose real name is Judith Power, told the Mail Online that Tony Abbott was as sleazy as some of her clients.

'I didn't see what he did until they replayed it on ABC news. I just couldn't believe it – it was the sleaziest looking smirk I've seen in a long long time and he looked sleazier than most of the blokes that ring me up…. And some of them are seriously weird,' Ms Power said.Scroll down for video

67-year-old grandmother, Judith Power, who told Prime Minister Tony Abbott on talkback radio that she worked on a sex line to make ends meet just before he winked, has dubbed his behavior 'sleazy' and 'misogynistic'

Mr Abbott has since admitted that he shouldn't have winked while listening to Ms Power's radio talk-back call while she told him she had to work on a phone sex line to make ends meet.

He said the wink was directed at the host of the ABC radio program and was not meant to be disparaging of the caller, who described herself as a chronically ill pensioner in tough financial circumstances.

Mr Abbott said he was looking at the host - the ABC's Jon Faine - and was winking his assent to take the call.

'Look, I was looking at Jon Faine, he was smiling at me and I winked back at him,' Mr Abbott told the Nine Network on Thursday.

'I shouldn't have done it ... I should have been more focused on the caller and less focused on the interviewer.'

Asked if he was being disparaging towards the woman, Mr Abbott said he was attempting to engage with the caller.

'Mistakes are always regrettable ... and I will do my best having made a mistake yesterday to make none today,' he said.

Mr Abbott has so far acknowledged that he shouldn't have winked during the interview, but claims that he was only winking his assent to take the call at the radio host John Faine

But Ms Power is not convinced, claiming the prime ministers words are just part of 'damage control' protocol.

'He wasn't leering at John – he was leering and sniggering because I said I was 67 and a sex line worker,' she said.

Mr Faine's comments so far, have also been somewhat removed from Mr Abbott's claims.

JON FAINE:Gloria in Warburton. Good morning Gloria you are talking to Tony Abbott the Prime Minister.JUDITH POWER:Hiya.TONY ABBOTT:Hi Gloria.MS POWER:Mr Abbott, I would like to ask you if you would like your mother or your grandmother to be in my situation. I am a 67 year old pensioner, three chronic incurable medical conditions – two life-threatening. I just survive on about $400 a fortnight after I pay my rent and I work on an adult sex line to make ends meet.[MR ABBOTT WINKS]Now, that's the only way I can do it. I've worked out and my maths isn’t crash hot that it’s going to cost me at least an extra $850 a year with the increases in medical visits and medication. I’m on a number of different medications that may probably increase as my conditions deteriorate. What do you suggest I cut out Mr Abbott – food, electricity, firewood, Christmas/birthday presents to my grandchildren or should we all just die and get out of your way?MR ABBOTT:Well Gloria, I absolutely understand that you're doing it tough – I absolutely understand…MS POWER:You don't give a stuff though, do you?MR FAINE:Keep it nice. Gloria, keep it nice. It's the Prime Minister you’re speaking to.MS POWER:No, I don't feel very nice about you Mr Abbott and why should I?MR ABBOTT:Well Gloria, what I want to do is get rid of the carbon tax, but you will keep the compensation that the former Labor government gave you to pay for the carbon tax. So, even if you spend $70 going to the doctor, even if you pay an extra 80 cents per prescription, almost certainly in pure cash terms, Gloria, you will be somewhat better off. Now, I’m not saying that you're on easy street, I'd never say that. Obviously you’re doing it tough. But let’s look at the reality here. The safety net kicks in after ten visits to the doctor – that's after $70 and yes there's an 80 cent increase in the pensioner co-payment, but you would’ve had an extra couple of hundred dollars a year as a result of your carbon tax compensation and we want to take that carbon tax off you.

'I raised an eyebrow because it's not every day that a grandmother on radio says that she supplements her pension by working on a sex call line,' Mr Faine said during his radio program on Thursday.

'It is a complete fabrication to say I somehow winked at the prime minister or was smirking or anything like that. Nor was I indicating that I needed his permission to continue which was the statement from the Prime Minister's office.'

But the grandmother of three from Warburton, who doesn't have internet in her home nor follow social media, is still quite shocked at the amount of attention the incident has received.

'If he'd then just said "I'm an old fashioned bloke and I got a bit embarrassed, and something like that happening had never occurred to me so I pulled a stupid face", it would have been over by now,' Ms Power said.

She described how she instantly received numerous calls of congratulations from friends and family before she fully understood the impact of what had happened.

'This has gone far enough, it's out of control – if he hadn't behaved how he did, what I said would have been forgotten by the end of the day if not before,' she said, revealing she was eager to get back to her normal life.

Ms Power had called in to the Talk back show to let off some steam over the planned introduction of a $7 GP co-payment, announced in the budget.

As a pensioner suffering from a range of illnesses including emphysema and arthritis, she revealed that she began to work on a sex line almost four years ago to make ends meet.

'I just survive on around $400 a fortnight after I pay my rent,' she told Mr Abbott.

'I work on an adult sex line to make ends meet. Now that's the only way I can do it.'

Mr Abbott's faux pas, which was caught on camera, comes as he faces a collapse in his personal approval rating.

The coalition is suffering in the opinion polls in the wake of the budget, with Labor having opened a 10-point lead on a two-party preferred basis at 55 per cent to 45 per cent.

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, the only woman in Mr Abbott's cabinet, said there was nothing sexist in the prime minister's wink which was intended as a go-ahead signal for the call.

'I think people are far to quick to judge others through this prism of everything being about misogyny or sexism,' she told ABC radio.

Ms Bishop said she was always treated with respect by Mr Abbott and her male colleagues in cabinet.

'Believe me, I've worked in some sexist environments and this isn't one of them,' she said.

But Ms Power claims the complete opposite, telling the Sydney Morning Herald that she was glad the incident received attention.

'I was a catalyst for him showing himself for what he is, which is sleazy and a misogynist,' she said.

Describing herself as a long-time feminist and anarchist, Ms Power said she was concerned about the fact that her real name had been revealed due to the line of her work.
