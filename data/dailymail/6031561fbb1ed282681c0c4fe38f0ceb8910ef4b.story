A new device promises to record your entire life - and save any 60 second slot for playback.

The Kapture, worn on the wrist like a watch, is a tiny recorder on a loop which continually overwrites itself.

This means that if anyone says anything that you wish you could keep for posterity, you simply tap the device.

The last minute of conversation or sounds are then sent to a smartphone app for storage where the extract can be left or edited down.

From there is can be stored or passed on to friends.

The device was invented by friends Mike Sarrow and Matthew Dooley based in Cincinnati.

They said possible uses could include saving the reaction of a child experiencing something for the first time.

It could also be used to record the unexpected interactions of daily life or a humorous anecdote from your family reunion.

Snippets of memorable conversation are immediately downloaded via Bluetooth onto a user's smartphone with one touch of the wristband

'With this technology, you can preserve and share real-time memories in a completely new way,' said Mr Sarrow. 

The wristband features a retro-inspired sound grill for its built-in microphone.

Both the bands and coloured grills are interchangeable, and are offered initially in black, white, seafoam, hard yellow, and hot orange. 

A company spokesman said: 'For the first time, an organic experience can be shared socially through the medium of sound. 

'With no distracting screen, Kapture promotes an acute awareness of one's surroundings, and empowers users to save interactions without leaving or disrupting the flow of conversation.

'Kapture is always running, ready to preserve the fleeting moments of our lives that pass too quickly.

'Instead of trying to retell an experience, Kapture allows you, as the creator, to share your story exactly as it happened.'

Snippets of memorable conversation are immediately downloaded via Bluetooth onto a user's smartphone with one touch of the wristband.

The audio can then be edited, enhanced, tagged, and shared via the Kapture mobile app to the user's social media platform of choice.

The device continuously overwrites itself, saving audio only when tapped, allowing the user to save just the moments they wish to remember.

The app also filters sound to improve recorded conversations, while minimising background noises that could get in the way. 

The Kapture itself can be charged in less than an hour using a micro-USB port. 

The inventors hope to have a product on the market by March 2014 and the company is looking for $150,000 (£96,000) of pledges from investors on crowdfunding Kickstarter.No retail price has been announced but a $75 (£48) pledge gets a Kapture in black and white plus the app.

One pledge level of the Kickstarter campaign features a 14-carat gold-plated grill.
