Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest installment of his weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The Barnet boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football.

YAYA NEEDS HIS COMEUPPANCE 

What an absolute farce the situation at Manchester City with Yaya Toure has become. There's only one thing that man wants – and that is more money and a longer contract.

It was rubbish what his agent Dimitry Seluk said about him being unhappy that the club did not celebrate his birthday. There's no doubt he is top quality and top class, and without him Manchester City would not have won the Barclays Premier League.

Exit: Yaya Toure wanted to leave City after claiming that nobody wished him happy birthday

Evidence: Manchester City said that Toure did receive a cake on the plane on their post-season tour

Influence: Toure was instrumental in City winning the Premier League this season

But why his agent didn't just go and knock on Sheikh Mansour's door to negotiate another year and a further pile of wedge is beyond me. The conduct and behaviour of some of these agents is quite despicable.

At 31, Toure has no resale value and I would love it, really love it, if City told him he was not going to get a new contract, point out he's got a deal in place at the moment and tell him get on with it.

He can take his birthday cake and stick it where the sun doesn't shine.

THE WEST HAM EVOLUTION

There is an interesting situation developing at my old club West Ham. How will it evolve there? 

The board are now taking more responsibility for signings and have ordered a change in the style of play and the introduction of a new attacking coach.

Is an attacking coach one who concentrates on technical finishing skills in and around the 18-yard box, or do you give him a bag of balls, the bibs and the discs and let him dictate the style of play of the team?

Brief: Sam Allardyce has been told West Ham must play a more attractive style of football next season

For me, you defend as a team, and defend from the front. And you attack as a team, starting from the goalkeeper and going through all the players in your squad.

Does the attacking coach make decisions on where the full-backs pass it to retain possession or look for penetrating diagonal and forward passes? 

Does he work with the back four, the midfield four, the one in the hole, who at the moment is Kevin Nolan, and the big man up front Andy Carroll?

Back in the swing: Teddy Sheringham has been lined up for a role as attacking coach at Upton Park

It will be very interesting to see if this works, or if it turns into a catastrophe.

There will certainly be interesting discussions at the West Ham training ground this summer.

QPR'S PROMOTION RETRIBUTION

I only ever managed one cup final and that was for QPR in 1986 against Oxford at Wembley Stadium, on a Sunday afternoon, in front of almost 91,000 people.

We lost, I was the worst player on the pitch and got substituted after a shocking display. My legs just would not move and the occasion proved too much for the young pup I was at the time.

We are going up: QPR beat Derby at Wembley in the Championship play-off final on Saturday

Hero: Bobby Zamora scored the winner in injury time to send QPR back to the Premier League

Glory: QPR's fans celebrate their promotion in the Wembley sunshine

The QPR fans left early on the day, leaving the blue and white end of Wembley virtually empty. Sitting on the bench, having been substituted, I shook my head with tears in my eyes knowing I had let them all down.

To see those fans on Saturday, when they won promotion back to the Premier League, singing and celebrating for what can only be described as daylight robbery, was very special.

Hopefully that makes it up to all of those fans who made the trip in 1986 that I so badly let down, and can finally put that one bed.

My week...

For three weeks it's been non-stop negotiation with an agent to sign a centre forward for the season ahead.

His name is John Akinde, we signed him from Alfreton Town. He's big, he's strong, he's powerful and hopefully he will do the business.

However, he's getting married this weekend and is off on his honeymoon to Thailand.

Unrest: Protesters confront soldiers in riot gear during a city centre anti-coup rally in Bangkok

Concern: Allen hopes his new striker John Akinde avoids danger on his honeymoon in Thailand

Now, after seeing the reports on the news about the goings on in Bangkok, where the army are clashing with protesters, I'm starting to get a little concerned.

I'm sure he will have a wonderful time, but it's not the most ideal place to visit at the moment and I'd like my new striker to be terrorising defences for me next season.

As a manager you always hope players do the right thing through the summer break and I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that he comes back in one piece.

Yaya Toure's agent should have knocked on Sheikh Mansour's door to negotiate a new contract rather than behave the way he did

West Ham's board are taking more responsibility for signings and want a better style of play
