Irish Republicans plotted to kidnap Queen Victoria at Balmoral to help free prisoners, it has emerged.

The ‘desperate and daring’ terrorists wanted to take the Queen from her Scottish estate and hold her hostage in a shabby cottage, according to newly-released records.

The rifle-wielding gang from Salford, Greater Manchester, intended to keep her until the government agreed to release Republicans from prisons across Britain and Ireland.

After a respected former police officer raised the alarm about the plot, dozens of undercover detectives, armed with revolvers and cutlasses, were sent to the estate, according to the Mirror.

A warning about the plot was sent to Scotland Yard from Manchester’s chief constable on October 14 1867.

Although he conceded he found it hard to believe such an ‘audacious’ plot would be carried out, he made clear he trusted his ‘intelligent’ and ‘perfectly sober’ informant.

The paper reports him as writing: ‘[The 
Republicans] believe Her Majesty goes about the country with very few 
attendants, no guard and that there will be no difficulty in 
accomplishing their design.’

He said the assault was planned for the 
following Tuesday.

Detectives were sent to the Aberdeenshire estate but the operation was scaled down after a few days when plotters may have realised their plans had been found out.

Queen Victoria was 48 years old at the time of the plot and 30 years into her reign. She died in January 1901 at the age of 81.

The files have been made available in the National Archives at Kew, West London, after 147 years.
