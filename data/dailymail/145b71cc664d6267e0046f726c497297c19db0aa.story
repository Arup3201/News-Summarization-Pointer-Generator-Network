Amanda Knox's retrial over the murder of Meredith Kercher opened in Florence today - but neither the American student nor her Italian ex-boyfriend was there to see the start of proceedings.

Instead, the 26-year-old was photographed taking a walk in her home town of Seattle, more than 5,000 miles from the the trial.

Miss Knox has said she will not return to Italy where she is accused of murdering her British roommate in 2007.

Knox and her one-time lover Rafaelle Sollecito served four years in jail for the murder of Meredith Kercher, who was found semi-naked with her throat slit in the flat she shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy.

Both were freed on appeal in 2011 but in March this year Italy’s highest court sensationally ordered them to face retrial.

In June judges published the reasons for that decision, saying the ruling by the appeal court that freed them was full of ‘deficiencies contradictions and illogical conclusions’.

Knox has said that her decision not to attend the re-trial was ‘common sense’.

‘I was imprisoned as an innocent person and I just can’t re-live that,’ said told NBC television.

In a memoir released earlier this year, Knox sought to portray herself as a naive young woman railroaded by a foreign justice system and not a callous sexual deviant as she was painted in many reports after her initial conviction.

Knox is not obliged to attend the retrial and can be represented by her lawyers. 

If found guilty, she would be able to appeal again, but Italy could apply for her extradition if that failed.
