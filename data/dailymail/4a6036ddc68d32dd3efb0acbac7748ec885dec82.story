Multi-millionaire Charles Gillion, 64, has shunned the high-life to be near his family and friends

Forget swimming pools and balconies, it's a red-brick, semi-detached, council home in Corby that multi-millionaire couple Charlie and Penelope Gillion really want.

It's an unlikely choice, but Britain's most modest lottery winner and his wife have vowed to buy their beloved home of 30 years from the local council.

Down-to-earth Charlie Gillion, 64, is one of 12 bus drivers
in Corby who sensationally scooped a massive £38million jackpot on the
Euromillions earlier this year.

Charlie, along with his wife Penelope, 65, a retired
cleaner, were left overwhelmed by the win and sensibly chose to sit on their
stash until they decided what to spend their fortune on.

Now the humble couple are patiently waiting for Corby Borough
Council to organise the deal, after being putting on a waiting list.

Incredibly, the winners have not even been on holiday to
celebrate their lottery scoop and admitted to happily ‘plodding along as before’.

The couple have shunned the idea of the ‘highlife’ and ‘flash
mansions’, instead happy to stay in their double-fronted, red-brick home to
stay close to their family and neighbours.

Penelope, originally from Scotland, said: ‘We are still here
at the moment. We have not moved on yet. We are still waiting to buy this
place.

‘We told the council and have been waiting nine or ten weeks
but they have not even been round yet to value the place.

‘They said there are so many other people applying to buy
that we have to wait. We are just hoping they get back to us shortly.

The Gillians have shunned fancy mansions to buy their semi-detached council home, pictured on the left-hand side, in Corby

‘We won’t be leaving Corby as all our close family are here.

‘We have not done much else really, Charlie still has the
same car, we’ve not been anywhere - nothing has changed much, we are still just
the same.

‘We are just plodding along as before - we are not worried
about buying flash cars or flash mansions or anything like that.

‘We have not started living the millionaire life style and
we never would it has not changed us a bit. You get some people who like to
live the highlife but not us.’

The generous couple have already made surprise visits to family
to share their winnings and plan to hand their current council house over to
their granddaughter and her young son in the future.

Penelope who has three children, ten grandchildren and six
great grandchildren added: ‘We won’t be leaving Corby as all our close family
are here.’

Neighbours heaped praise on the couple, proudly revealing
their good fortune hadn’t changed them at all.

Margaret Donnachie, 64, said:  ‘They’re great neighbours, very kind, very
considerate.

‘Everyone gets along well and it’s the kind of place where
people really know their neighbours, we’ve know them for 30 years.

‘They still shop in Asda, I still see them walking to the
shops, there are no airs and graces.

‘They’re just lovely people, I wish it were me but I’m happy
for them too.’

Another neighbour said the Gillions were really ‘genuine’
people.

He said: ‘With the kind of money they’ve got now you’d
forgive people for thinking it was time to move on to bigger and better things.

‘You wouldn’t blame them if they wanted to zoom around in
sports cars or buy a swimming pool but those two aren’t like that.

‘It’s great to see they’re in no rush to move away from
their home and their friends no matter how much money they have.’

The bus drivers had all been part of the syndication for a
number of years before they had the big win on Friday, March 16.

Shockingly a former member of the group, single mum Hazel
Loveday, 36, dropped out of the syndication shortly before the amazing win.
