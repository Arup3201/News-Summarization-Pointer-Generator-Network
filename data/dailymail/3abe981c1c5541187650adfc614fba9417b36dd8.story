An Italian politician has come under fire for suggesting on Twitter that two aid workers captured by jihadists had consensual sex with their captors.

Maurizio Gasparri was referring to Vanessa Marzullo, 21, and Greta Ramelli, 20, who were captured by militants in Syria believed to be from Al-Qaeda affiliated group Jabhat al-Nusra in August.

They arrived back in Rome on Friday, after which Mr Gasparri, the vice president of the Italian senate, tweeted: ‘#Vanessa and Greta [had] consensual sex with their captors? And we pay!’

An Italian politician has come under fire for suggesting that two aid workers captured by jihadists - Vanessa Marzullo, 21, and Greta Ramelli, 20 (pictured arriving in Rome on Friday) - had sex with their captors

A huge row has erupted in Italy over claims that a ransom was paid to guarantee the release of the aid workers. Here Marzullo is jostled by the press as she arrives home

It’s likely that his comment about money was a reference to claims that the Italian government paid the Islamic extremists a £9million ransom to guarantee their release.

However, Mr Gasparri strenuously denied that he was suggesting the girls had sex with the jihadists.

He claimed he had heard reports they had, and was merely asking if it was true, according to the Daily Telegraph.

It reported he told La Repubblica: ‘A [news] site reported the two girls had told the authorities [they had sex].

Gasparri (pictured) found himself in hot water last year when he tweeted disparaging remarks about the English following England's World Cup defeat to Italy

‘I also wrote that I hoped it wasn’t true. I simply noted the claim and asked if it was true. I didn’t state anything.’

Last year he found himself in hot water after he posted an insult on his Twitter account following England's World Cup defeat.

Gasparri labelled English people 'pretentious d***s' just minutes after the final whistle of the 2-1 setback.

Diplomatic sources at the British Embassy in Rome said at the time that the reports were "highly insulting."

Gasparri, a member of disgraced former PM Silvio Berlusconi's People of Freedom Party, wrote: 'It's always a pleasure to say 'go...themselves" to the English...pretentious and d***s.'

Minutes later he posted another offending Tweet writing: 'Great game, great victory it's great that it gets the English right in that place always arrogant and unbelievable.'

His offensive postings were also heavily criticised by Italians on Twitter with many saying it was 'hardly the language of a politician' with others calling on him to apologise.

Instead Gasparri, who used to Minister of Communication in Berlusconi's government, later wrote on his account: 'Detestable English, is that OK?'

News of Ramelli and Marzullo’s return was applauded in Parliament in Italy, but also drew heavy criticism from opposition politicians after Arab media reports suggested a ransom of 12 million euros (£9m) had been paid.

European governments including Italy have long tolerated or facilitated ransom payments to secure the release of hostages although the practice has frequently been denied officially.

The leader of the Northern League party, Matteo Salvini, said on Twitter: 'If the government really paid a ransom of 12million euros, it would be disgusting!'
