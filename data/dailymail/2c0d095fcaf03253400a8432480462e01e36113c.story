One of Australia's finest jewellers  has died after she plunged to her death from a Queensland high rise apartment block after a tough recovery from ovarian cancer.

Ann Middleton, 62, died suddenly on the Gold Coast on Friday night.

She had beaten ovarian cancer two years ago but spent the past two years in unbearable pain following nerve damage.

Dubbed Australia's Queen of Diamonds, Ms Middleton had designed jewellery for several high profile personalities including former US President Bill Clinton, Ian Thorpe and Olivia Newton John.

She also raised more than $5 million for Australian charities by donating several of her designs, as well as donating a number of pieces to Olivia Newton John's charities.

Ms Middleton had also collaborated with international model Jessica Hart to design a piece of a Queensland flood victims charity auction.

Her son Jaime said Ms Middleton's death would be felt around the world, the Courier Mail reports. 

'She was much admired and loved by not only Australians but clients and celebrities the world over,' he said in a statement.

Her friend Karen Phillips said the jewellery designer had been a true gem.

'She was larger than life ' she really was Australia's Queen of Diamonds – and a true shining light for so many,' Ms Phillips said.

Ms Middleton's jewellery career, which spanned 40 years, saw her recognised with a number of high accolades including being named the Diamonds International Award Winner in 1994.

She was also awarded the Order of Australia medal and was named the first South Australian of the year.
