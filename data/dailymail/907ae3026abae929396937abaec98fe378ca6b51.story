Cuddle: TV presenter Lizzie Cundy pictured with chancellor George Osborne at the Winter Ball

The Dom Perignon flowed like water at £100 a bottle, served in blue glass flutes which matched the azure carpet and the collars of the mandarin jackets worn by the silver-service waiters.

But the Conservatives’ £400-a-head winter ball, once the social highlight of the party’s year, was meant to be a private affair.

All the same there was not much sign of recession. Around 600 guests arrived at the glass-roofed ballroom of the Hurlingham Club in West London — where the dress code was ‘winter glamour’: black tie for men and floor-length ball gowns for the women.

But not quite so low-key for when ordinary club members complained about being unable to get in the entrance because of all the Rolls-Royces and Daimlers clogging the drive. They were airily informed by staff: ‘We’ve been told not to say anything.’

With an eye, no doubt, on last night’s vote, David Cameron, dressed in a lounge suit, made a speech about how the Tories had modernised and were no longer the party of privilege.

‘It was brilliant,’ says TV presenter Lizzie Cundy, who cuddled Chancellor George Osborne and tackled the PM about gay marriage.

‘I had brought a gay friend, Nick Ede, and was determined to speak to Cameron about gay marriage and introduce him because he wants to get married,’ says Lizzie, ex-wife of Chelsea footballer Jason Cundy. ‘The Prime Minister was very encouraging so I kissed him on the cheek to say thank you.’

Cameron’s egalitarian theme was somewhat at odds with the opulence of the party, where guests included property magnates Nick Candy and Bruce Ritchie and an auction where one wealthy supporter paid £100,000 for a painting of the PM.

Tables were laden with vases of 
ivory-coloured roses and lilies and the menu included goat’s cheese with
beetroot, lamb in samphire and strawberry mousse.

But perhaps the most significant feature was Cameron’s speech. ‘Not everyone stood to applaud,’ I am told.

Beards, almost extinct at Parliament under Thatcher and Blair — both hated facial hair — are making a comeback.

The latest MP to have sprouted is Wiltshire North Tory James Gray, who has returned from a research trip to Antarctica bewhiskered.

‘I am going for the George V look,’ laughs Gray, stroking his furry chops.

Impressive though his three-week growth is, Gray has some way to go before matching W. G. Grace lookalike Lib Dem Viscount Thurso.

For all this there are no beards in Cabinet. Though that is not to say high office is not a hairy place.

While the cake-baking brother of the Duchess of Cambridge has his heart set on building up his own successful business empire, it seems that James Middleton still has a little way to go.

The latest set of accounts for a company set up by Middleton, 25, show it was far from being in profit at the end of its first financial year and had debts of more than £24,000.

But an entry in the accounts for his grandly named Nice Group London Ltd suggests there is no need to panic — his debts are guaranteed by a relative.

‘The bank overdraft is secured by a member of the director’s family,’ says the note.

In an interview last year, Marlborough-educated Middleton said that he wanted to be known for standing on his own two feet, and added: ‘Nothing is handed to anyone on a plate’.

He set up his first business selling ingredients for people to make their own cakes at home in 2007.

It now operates through his parents’ Party Pieces website from premises next door to their business in Berkshire.

The accounts for Nice Group London for the year up to the end of last April show it had debts of £32,575 owing to creditors.

After the deduction of stocks worth £3,320 and money owed from debtors of £5,151, it had net current liabilities of £24,104.

Last heard of working in a Brighton cake shop, former TV presenter Annabel Giles is unlikely to tuck into pastries in future, well not if she heeds the advice of her bank. She claims staff there told her to ‘eat less food’.

While that might be good advice for someone overweight, pencil-slim Annabel, ex-wife of rock star Midge Ure and a former face of Max Factor, was not impressed.

Cutting costs: Annabel Giles was told by her bank she could cut her outgoing by eating less food

Annabel , 53, who has a daughter by Midge and a teenage son by another relationship, says: ‘I have just agreed to part company with Nationwide after over 30 years. Having frozen my accounts I was told by an “adviser” to cut my outgoings by eating less food.’

Nationwide says: ‘We can’t comment on individuals, but if someone had gone over their agreed overdraft it would be a reason to freeze the account. We would give them an expenditure sheet and there would be questions about their outgoings including the cost of any mortgage and household bills, including food.’

Adored by London’s right-on critics, architect Lord (Norman) Foster is not quite so revered in New York, where his plans for Manhattan’s public library, which featured in the film Breakfast At Tiffany’s, have attracted opprobrium.

Michael Kimmelman, of the New York Times, says: ‘The designs have all the elegance and distinction of a suburban mall.

‘What results is an awkward, cramped,  banal pastiche of tiers facing claustrophobia-inducing windows, built around a space-wasting atrium with a curved staircase more suited to a Las Vegas hotel. I’m not buying it.’

Turning to one of Foster’s London projects, Kimmelman adds: ‘I am reminded that he is also responsible for the canopied enclosure of the inner court at the British Museum, a pompous waste of public space that inserts a shopping gallery into the heart of a sublime cultural institution.’

These are tough times for Bianca Jagger. The former wife of Rolling Stone Mick is in Nicaragua to tie up the affairs of her brother Carlos, who has died unexpectedly.

Bianca cut short a conference on ocean pollution with Prince Albert of Monaco to dash to Carlos’s hospital bedside in Los Angeles when he was taken ill.

‘Bianca is devastated,’ a friend tells me. ‘She and Carlos were very close growing up in Managua, where their father was a diplomat.’ Bianca’s daughter Jade, is said to have been a considerable comfort to her mother.

Apropos the Tory winter ball, David Cameron made a beeline for louche club owner Peter Stringfellow.

Shaking 72-year-old Stringy’s hand, Cameron told him: ‘I see you are taking on Nick Clegg,’ — a reference to my item last week about Stringfellow’s threat to stand against the Lib Dem leader if he made another reference to his taking the pensioners’ Winter Fuel Allowance.

‘David was very jovial and joked with Peter that he could provide some tips for handling Clegg,’ I am told.
