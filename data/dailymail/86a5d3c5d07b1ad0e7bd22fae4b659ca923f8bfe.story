Carer: Sarah Biggs, 45, pleaded guilty to fraud and was jailed for 21 months at Chichester Crown Court

A carer who stole £90,000 from a dementia-suffering pensioner's bank account has been jailed for almost two years.

Sarah Biggs orchestrated the sale of 85-year-old John Gallo's family home in Wallington, Surrey, before moving him 50 miles away to Worthing, West Sussex, so she could pocket the proceeds.

The 45-year-old, who had cared for him since 2003, exploited her position to almost empty his bank account over three years - then left him alone and uncared for when the money ran out.

She had been informed by her bosses at Sutton London Borough Council that Mr Gallo was a vulnerable elderly man who had been conned by rogue traders in the past, a court was told.

In 2006, she helped him sell his large house in Wallington - where he had lived since childhood - then played a big role in his £82,000 purchase of a flat in Worthing, near where she lived.

Biggs had isolated Mr Gallo from his estranged family and care services while she helped herself to £92,367 left over from the house sale, Chichester Crown Court in West Sussex heard.

Her crime was only uncovered after Mr Gallo was found wandering outside in the snow in his underpants in winter 2008 and West Sussex County Council took over management of his affairs.

Position of trust: Gallo (outside court on Friday), who had cared for the man since 2003, exploited her position to almost empty his bank account over a three-year period - then left him uncared for when the money ran out

Biggs, who had claimed the money was given to her by Mr Gallo, pleaded guilty to fraud and was jailed for 21 months on Friday by Judge Claudia Ackner.

The judge told her: ‘This offence is a very great breach of trust by you as the carer of a very elderly and vulnerable gentleman. You knew Mr Gallo was a man of some considerable financial means.

‘As his care worker throughout that period, you knew he was vulnerable to all forms of abuse - in particular financial abuse. You were in a position of trust by Mr Gallo.

‘The basis of your plea is you entered a situation where you received huge sums of money from Mr Gallo when you were aware to do so was improper. In receiving these sums, you acted dishonestly.’

Biggs had stashed the proceeds from the sale of Mr Gallo's home in Wallington in a Nationwide bank account she had opened by forging the pensioner's signature.

She then forged 11 cheques from the account to pay herself £27,000, and made cash withdrawals of £12,360 using a debit card.

The rest of the money was received by standing orders to her own account, and large transfers funnelled through an internet savings account she had also opened in Mr Gallo's name.

Jonathan Edwards, prosecuting, said Biggs ceased contact with Mr Gallo when the account was ‘practically empty’ in late 2008.

'He was losing weight. He had no mattress on his bed. He kept a sparsely furnished flat which was filthy. He had poor quality clothes and had stopped paying his bills'

‘The Crown says it could be viewed that he was simply no longer of any use to her,’ he said. ‘At that time, he was losing weight. He had no mattress on his bed.

‘He kept a sparsely furnished flat which was filthy. He had poor quality clothes and had stopped paying his bills.’

Biggs, of Worthing, had been instrumental in moving Mr Gallo to Worthing.

Mr Edwards added: ‘It was said by Miss Biggs in interview that Mr Gallo wanted to move to the coast to be nearer to his sister. There had not been contact between Mr Gallo and his sister for 20 years.

‘With that in mind, Miss Biggs telephoned Mr Gallo's sister but it seems she did not facilitate in a reunion of Mr Gallo and his sister. Miss Biggs told Mr Gallo that his sister did not want contact with him.

‘That seems to be untrue. The move to 
Worthing had the effect of isolating Mr Gallo and making him vulnerable 
to exploitation by Miss Biggs.’

Simon Gruchy, defending, said Biggs could repay the money in full. He added: ‘She should not have taken those sums and she had accepted it was dishonest and that is where her criminality lies.

‘She has lost her good name, she's lost her job - a job she was good at and did for over 20 years. This was a relationship which developed in a way that was completely out of character as far as this lady was concerned.’

'To be treated like this by someone who claimed to be caring for him was simply appalling and the team that worked with him and his family have found this quite traumatic'

Amanda Rogers, West Sussex County Council

Judge Ackner said Biggs could be out of jail within ten and a half months.

After the sentencing, West Sussex County Council's director of adults' services Amanda Rogers said: ‘This was a shocking case.

‘To be treated like this by someone who claimed to be caring for him was simply appalling and the team that worked with him and his family have found this quite traumatic.

‘This is a vulnerable elderly gentleman, who has long term mental health problems and dementia.

‘He was let down and manipulated by the person who claimed to be caring for him. She cut him off from his family, she took all his money and didn't ensure he was safe.

‘He wasn't managing his food or fluids and didn't have a bed in his flat. In terms of the scale of the financial abuse and the level of manipulation and pre-meditation, this is one of the worst cases we've seen.

‘We are glad to have secured this outcome and to have got him back in regular contact with his family.’
