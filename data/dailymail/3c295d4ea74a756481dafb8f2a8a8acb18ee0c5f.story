Apple is planning to put some muscle behind its future iPhones - literally.

The Cupertino-based company yesterday published a patent application to use an ‘artificial muscle system’ for focusing cameras in devices such as its iPhone and iPad.

The patent claims the system would contract in a similar way to how muscles move to focus the lens and take images.

Apple yesterday published a patent application to use ‘artificial muscle’ for focusing cameras in devices such as its iPhone and iPad. The artificial muscle structure is pictured here. It is based on a class of ‘smart material’ that change shape when near an electric field. The contracting movement is similar to a real muscle

The system could allow for much slimmer mobile systems that use less power while carrying larger camera components, the company said.

United States Patent Application No. 20140168799, entitled ‘Artificial Muscle Camera Lens Actuator’, describes how the structure will be based on electroactive polymers (EAP).

EAPs, or artificial muscles, are a class of ‘smart material’ that deform in the presence of an electric field.

The muscle that Apple has outlined would replace the comparatively large voice coil motor (VCM) currently used to focus mobile phones cameras.

While it may sound like science-fiction, the idea to use artificial muscle isn’t new. The technology, for instance, is already being used in touch feedback in some video game controllers.

The construction is built inside a metal frame and supported by springs.

A circular electrode-EAP sits on top of the conical lens, with a hole that works as the camera's aperture. The movement is produced when the lens is subjected to an electrical field

Whether Apple will use the EAP technology in the future iPhone 6  (leaked image pictured) remains unclear

‘There have been suggestions to use artificial muscle technology for implementing a camera autofocus lens actuator,’ Apple said in its application.

However, the filing claims that EAP materials can now be ‘engineered and developed to for high volume manufacture.’

Apple claims they have also tried to use EAP to create an autofocus lens, ‘but a completely engineered solution for high volume manufacture or mass production may not be available.’

Their solution involves placing EAPs in a cone truncated shape, which is surrounded by negative electrodes on top, and positive electrodes on the bottom.

Apple's solution involves placing EAPs in a cone truncated shape, which is surrounded by negative electrodes on top, and positive electrodes on the bottom. In this layout, the ‘artificial muscle’ can use the electrical potential between negative and positive electrodes to move the lens up and down

The iPhone 6 may be able to track altitude, weather and even air pressure, according to code found in the iOS 8 operating system.

The files suggest a built-in barometer could provide instant weather readings by forecasting changes in the air pressure.

The barometer could also be useful for mountain climbers, runners or bikers, who want to keep track of their altitude while training.

And as well as environmental readings, the new sensors would improve the accuracy and speed of the phone’s location services.

In this layout, the ‘artificial muscle’ could use the electrical potential between negative and positive electrodes to move the lens up and down.

As well as this, a circular electrode-EAP sits on top of the lens, with a hole that works as the camera's aperture, according to Apple Insider.

Apple said this will not only reduce costs ‘significantly’, but it will also ‘exhibit extremely low power consumption.’

The assembly, they claim, also has the ability to support larger optical technologies.

However, whether Apple will use the technology in the future iPhone 6 device remains unclear.
