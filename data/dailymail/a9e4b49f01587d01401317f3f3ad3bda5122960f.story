A four-year-old boy was accidentally killed after he fell on top of a hammock where his uncle was using a knife to whittle a piece of wood.

Little Bralyn Shively was pushing the 
hammock in his family's Piedmont, Oklahoma backyard on Saturday afternoon when it suddenly broke and fell to the 
ground.

Police said the boy was impaled when he fell on top of his uncle, 36-year-old Chris Coates, who was still holding the 
knife used for carving.

Tragic: Bralyn Shively, 4, had just blown out the candles on his birthday cake the week before. Little did the family know it would be the last birthday they would celebrate

Losing battle: Bralyn Shively, 4, seen here with his dad, was rushed to the hospital, but could not be saved

Close-knit: Bralyn was one of six children and considered all of his brothers and sisters to be his best friends

The Shively family released a statement paying tribute to Bralyn's short, happy life.

'Little Bralyn, at age 4, was full of life. His sweet spirit radiated for all to see. Bralyn showed love on his family and friends, and everyone loved him.

He called his brothers and sisters his best friends. If you asked him what he was doing, he would respond ‘playing with my best friends.'

Bralyn was loving, imaginative, intuitive, spontaneous and feisty. Bralyn is such a blessing to us, and we love him very much!

We miss him terribly, and his passing has left an emptiness in our lives.

Bralyn was a huge part of our family, a void we will never fill.

The only thing that helps is knowing our family will be together again in heaven.'

Bralyn and a family friend: Oklahoma Police Department said the fatal stabbing was an accident

NewsOK reported Coates, who was visiting from Iowa, called out to family members for help as he performed CPR on Bralyn.

The child was rushed to hospital where he died.

'When officers arrived, they found paramedics trying to revive the child, work on the child,'
 said Msgt. Gary Knight with the Oklahoma City police department. 
'Ultimately they transported the child to an area hospital, where he was
 pronounced dead.'

Oklahoma City police Sgt. Gary Knight said it was a tragic accident, but the Canadian County District Attorney’s office will make a formal ruling on the case.

'All evidence points toward this being an accidental death,' he said today.

Medical examiner’s 
spokeswoman Amy Elliott said an
 autopsy was being performed to determine the cause and manner of Bralyn's death.

Coates was not arrested.

The family had just moved into their home in Piedmont two months ago. A house they considered to be their dream home.

The
 family was out enjoying the beautiful day when tragedy struck. Bralyn's
 father says the kids were huddled around their favorite uncle, who was 
in from out of town.
