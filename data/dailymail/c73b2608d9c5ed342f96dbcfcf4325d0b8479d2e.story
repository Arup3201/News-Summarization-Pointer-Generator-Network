Romania's prime minister has moved out of his office because he believes the country's president has bugged his phone. 

Victor Ponta cleared his desk in an office in the defence ministry to escape the alleged surveillance by President Traian Basescu. 

It is the latest development in a bitter feud between the two politicians.

The president and prime minister have in the past accused each other of corruption and dislike for each other. 

Mr Ponta is expected to run against a candidate appointed by Mr Basescu, who is stepping down after two terms in office.

According to The Telegraph: 'Since this morning I have moved office. I asked the defence minister if I could have an office in the ministry,' Mr Ponta said on Wednesday. '

As it's a military facility, everybody who comes in is registered,' he added.

Mr Ponta believes an alleged phone call made from his office was cited in a corruption investigation involving a party colleague.

The prime minister has claimed the investigation is a 'set up'. 

Elections will take place in November. 

Critics of the prime minister have accused him of making the allegation up in the run-up to the political battle.

Mr Ponta recently described the president as a 'corrupt communist' who 'will end up in jail'.
