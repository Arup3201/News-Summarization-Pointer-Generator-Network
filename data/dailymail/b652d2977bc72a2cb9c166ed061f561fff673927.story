West Bromwich Albion manager Tony Pulis is continuing his search for strikers after going cool on a couple of early targets.

Pulis watched Rudy Gestede of Blackburn on Sunday but the 26-year-old Benin international failed to impress as his side lost to Wolves.

Albion have asked about Rickie Lambert but Liverpool will not loan him out and would only sell for the money they paid Southampton for him in the summer. Lambert himself wants to fight for his place.

Baggies boss Tony Pulis has no interest in bringing Leicester's Jamie Vardy to West Bromwich Albion

Pulis will not pursue interest in Jamie Vardy of Leicester while any possibility of a move for Demba Ba would stall over his wages.

The 29-year-old, who Pulis tried to sign for Stoke City from Hoffenheim, is on around £130,000 a week before tax in Turkey with Besiktas and Albion don't have that kind of budget to play with.

Pulis is also reluctant to go back to Stoke to try and sign players although he does admire Jon Walters, Robert Huth and Marc Wilson.

The Albion manager may be forced to continue without assistant Paul Jewell as the 50-year-old is understood to be considering his role at The Hawthorns just a week after joining the backroom staff.

Manchester City are ready to rebuff Juventus interest in Stevan Jovetic. The Italian side want Jovetic on loan but City would like the 25-year-old to stay as part of the squad chasing domestic and European titles.

A deal could be revisited in the summer when City will fine tune their squad again and look to add a different striker. Juventus have also asked about taking Paulinho on loan from Tottenham but the White Hart Lane club are reluctant to loan also.

Meanwhile, Anderlecht midfielder Denis Praet, who has been monitored by Manchester City says he would be reluctant to move to the Premier League champions.

The 19-year-old Belgium international said: 'I think for my development it would be best if I switch to a middle-class club in a bigger league. Should I go to a club in Manchester, I would not have good prospects.'

Wigan striker Shaun Maloney has attracted bids from Celtic and Leicester City this window but Chicago Fire are continuing to press for his signature.

The MLS side believe Maloney, 31, can be a big hit in the USA and the Scotland international is impressed by the league's growing profile. Everton have also made tentative enquiries for Maloney, who joined Wigan from Celtic for £850,000 in 2011. Leicester had a £750,000 bid rejected earlier this month.

Owen Coyle iis keen for Huddersfield Town forward Martin Paterson to join him in the MLS with Houston Dynamo.

Northern Ireland international Paterson, 27, played for Coyle at Burnley and was instrumental in their promotion season. 

He struggled with injuries and moved to Huddersfield where he has had loan spells with Bristol City and Fleetwood but with little success. 

Linking up with Coyle again for a new challenge appeals and he is ready to cross the Atlantic.

Sampdoria held further meetings with Samuel Eto'o's representative Claudio Vigorelli on Monday evening.

The Italians remain interested in the 33-year-old Everton striker but the parties are some distance apart on the player's current wages. They have proposed a two-year deal with the option of a third. 

Everton maintain they have yet to receive an enquiry from Sampdoria but it seems the Italians are working out if they can afford him before making an official bid.

Aston Villa will not be able to sign Adnan Januzaj on loan from Manchester United while they have Tom Cleverley.

Under Premier League rules clubs cannot have two players on loan from the same club. United have been trying to reach agreement with Villa over a permanent deal for Cleverley but the player is reluctant to commit at this stage and is free in the summer. Everton have always maintained an interest in the 25-year-old.

Southampton scouts were at Braga vs Sporting Lisbon on Sunday as they ran the rule over midfielder Rafa Silva.

The 21-year-old, who can play on either wing or behind the strikers, has been on Southampton's radar for nearly a year. He has a £15m release clause but Braga would negotiate as they need the money. Rafa was part of Portugal's World Cup squad although he didn't play and has also attracted interest from Sevilla.

Tottenham are understood to have turned down the opening salvo from Besiktas for defender Younes Kaboul. The Frenchman is available if the right offer comes in and has also been discussed as a potential bargaining chip along with Aaron Lennon should Tottenham step up interest in Everton midfielder James McCarthy. As revealed by Sportsmail, Tottenham like the Everton midfielder, as do Arsenal, but Everton do not wish to sell.

Tottenham are waiting for Leicester and Swansea to formalise bids for Kyle Naughton but otherwise are anticipating a quiet window. They are prepared to wait until summer to restructure their squad and at better value prices.

QPR are continuing to show interest in Inter Milan midfielder Yann M'Vila. 

Inter want QPR to take over their loan of the player from Rubin Kazan and that means QPR picking up 80 per cent of his wages. M'Vila has so far shown little inclination in moving to Loftus Road but has few better offers. 

QPR's budget is limited but Italian clubs are continuing to court Adel Taarabt and his wages could go towards incomings.

Manager Harry Redknapp is still keen to add another forward if possible and has shown an interest in Standard Liege winger Paul-Jose M'Poku. The 22-year-old was at Tottenham as a teenager.
