Elliot Rodger often complained on his YouTube videos that his life wasn't fair. But, his own social media presence reveals that the son of Hunger Games assistant director Peter Rodger lived a life of privilege.

He posted several videos and pictures behind the wheel of his black BMW 328i, a luxury coupe with a starting price tag of nearly $40,000.

Rodger is believed to have killed six people in Santa Barbara on Friday night because he was frustrated that he was still a virgin at age 22.

But in 2012, he posted a YouTube video of his first class flight from London to Los Angeles. He flewÂ  Virgin Atlantic.

He posted pictures of a limo ride to Heathrow Airport, the meal he was served on his in-flight meal and even included a picture of his legs, lounging luxuriously in the roomy first class sleeper seat.

In London, according to his Facebook profile, he attended a private Katy Perry concert and was close enough to snap a photo of the 'California Girls' singer on his phone.

Rodger grew up in tony Woodland Hills, Los Angeles in a four bedroom, five bath home that is valued at just under $1million.

His father is Peter Rodger, a top Hollywood honcho, who served as assistant director for The Hunger Games. His grandfather, George Rodger, was a legend in the photography world who was a founding member of Magnum Photos.

His mother, Lichin 'Chin' Rodger, is a nurse from Malaysia. Peter divorced Chin and married Soumaya Akaaboune, a French-Moroccan actress who stars in the French version of the Real Housewives.

She recently had roles in 2013's Lovelace and the 2012 film Playing for Keeps.

Elliot Rodger has one little sister and a half brother from his father's second marriage.

Elliot Rodger took great pains on his social media accounts to boast about his luxurious life.

In addition to posting several pictures of him with his black BMW - the same car he used on his rampage - he also showed off a Mercedes-Benz M-Class SUV, which has a starting price tag of $48,000.

'I have a nice car, a BMW. Well, nicer than 90percent of the people in my college,' he boasted in one video.

Rodger also dressed well. In his online manifesto, he wrote about having his Gucci sunglasses broken when he was beaten up. He later replaced them with another designer pair of shades.

'These sunglasses here are $300, Giorgio Armani,' he cooed in the same video.

'See? Look at how fabulous I look.'

Police say Rodger shot himself in the head after stabbing his three roommates to death, gunning down two sorority sisters and a man in a convenience store at the University of California - Santa Barbara.
