The new Brains, Parker and Lady Penelope from the upcoming Thunderbirds Are Go! series have been unveiled - but the characters' looks are not quite what was expected.

All three have been given a makeover for the modern age - but have ended up looking eerily similar to some famous faces.

The revamped Lady Penelope looks dramatically younger than the original version, while her blonde bob haircut has been replaced by a shoulder-length do, more akin to that of Paris Hilton or Taylor Swift.

But the digital makeovers made the characters look more like Paris Hilton (left) and Noel Gallagher (right)

Nick Wilson, former Channel 5 director of children's programmes and now a producer and script editor, said the new-look Lady Penelope might 'ruffle a few feathers'.

He said: 'There is an increasing tendency today to make girl characters more tomboyish, to put them in dungarees. Broadcasters don't want them to be butch but they don't want them to be too girly. They want stronger role models for girls.

'But Lady Penelope is a pretty strong role model so you can't just go on looks, it's what underneath that counts. Let's see how she turns out three or four episodes in. We have only seen a glimpse.' 

Brains, who traditionally always donned a bow tie and blue spectacles, has kept the snazzy glasses but now has an open neck shirt, giving him an uncanny resemblance to comedian Alan Carr.

Meanwhile, Parker the chauffeur appears to have aged incredibly well and, with his casual jumper and black coat look, has similarities to Noel Gallagher.   

Earlier this month, ITV caused a stir when it unveiled the new-look Tracy brothers from International Rescue.

The first look at the CGI enhanced Tracy brothers (left to right - Scott, Virgil, Alan, Gordon and John) didn't go down as well as expected as fans compared them to a boyband

The most noticeable difference with the brothers comes in the form of their new outfits. Ditching their trademark hats, the men now have metro-sexual haircuts with the help of styling wax.

Their pilots' suits have also been swapped for lyrca while their sashes have been given a massive gadget upgrade.  

At the time many fans reacted angrily on social networking site Twitter, with one writing: ‘Thunderbirds are meant to be puppets. Nothing more, nothing less.’

Another joked: ‘Is That 1D Or The Thunderbirds?!’ and another wrote: ‘One Direction a bunch of puppets, well the new Thunderbirds adds evidence to this theory.’  

ITV has confirmed Gone Girl star Rosamund Pike will be voicing Lady Penelope, while Fonejacker and Four Lions star Kayvan Novak will provide the voice for Brains.

Game of Thrones and Love Actually actor Thomas Brodie-Sangster will voice John Tracy.

How they were: The original series was made up of puppets whereas the remake relies heavily on CGI

Actor David Graham, who voiced Gordon Tracy, Brains, Parker and Kyrano in the original Thunderbirds, will return as the voice of Parker. 

One episode of Thunderbirds are Go is written by David Baddiel and will feature Sylvia Anderson, who voiced Lady Penelope in the original series,

Thunderbirds was turned into a live-action film in 2004, but the Hollywood production was poorly received by fans and critics. 

ITV have promised that the new show will 'deliver a new level of action-adventure animation whilst also paying tribute to the classic 1960’s phenomenon.' 

The new series is a co-production between ITV Studios and New Zealand-based Pukeko Pictures in association with the Weta Workshop, the team behind The Lord of the Rings and Avatar.
