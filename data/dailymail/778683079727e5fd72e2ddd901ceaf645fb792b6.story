European migrants should be restricted from working in the EU, according to almost three-quarters of MailOnline readers.

It reveals 44 per cent want Britain to leave the EU while 40 per cent disagree with the idea of severing ties with Brussels.

MailOnline readers are split 44-40 on whether the UK should remain in the European Union

A majority of the 40,000 people who took part in the survey say that resources should not be distributed across the EU from rich to poorer countries 

Some 48 per cent of those surveyed said that overall EU membership has been a 'bad thing' for the UK

More than 9 in 10 people said immigrants must adapt to the values and culture of the United Kingdom, with just 4 per cent of people disgareeing

The EUvox quiz was launched by a collaboration of leading academic institutes and NatCen Social Research on 22nd April and completed by 40,000 people through MailOnline.

Analysis of the data reveals what MailOnline readers really think of Europe, as political parties slug it out in the final days of campaigning before polls open on Thursday morning.

The question of whether Britain should remain in the European Union has been central to much of the debate, with Ukip wanting to pull out altogether and the Tories promising an in-out referendum by 2017 after clawing back some powers.

Overall 23 per cent of MailOnline ‘completely disagree’ that the UK should remain part of the EU, while another 22 per cent ‘disagree’. By contrast 11 per cent completely agreed Britain should remain, with another 28 per cent saying they also agreed, while 16 per cent said they neither agreed nor disagreed.

Almost half – 48 per cent – agreed that ‘overall, EU membership has been a bad thing for the United Kingdom’.

Just one in five – 21 per cent – thought the EU should ‘redistribute resources from richer to poorer countries’, with 63 per cent disagreeing.

Giving gay couples the same rights as heterosexual couples to marry is backed by 57 per cent of MailOnline readers surveyed

On tax, most people said it was wrong to redistribute wealth from the richest people to the poorest, with only 27 per cent of people agreeing

44 per cent of people want to see the top rate of tax - currently 45p - to be reduced, with 39 per cent of people disagreeing

A large majority of people - 76 per cent - think that when a state rescues a bank it should also take control it, with 13 per cent take the opposite view

The ability of EU migrants to move to Britain to work, or claim benefits, has also dominated headlines in the run-up to polling day.

Some 72 per cent of readers agreed that the right of EU citizens to work in the United Kingdom should be restricted, compared to 21 per cent who disagreed.

Users were asked whether ‘immigrants must adapt to the values and culture of the United Kingdom’. Nine out of 10 people – 91 per cent - either completely agreed or agreed, with less than 1 per cent completely disagreeing.

More than half of readers – 57 per cent – backed same sex couples having the same rights as heterosexual couples to marry, but fewer than a third disagreed.

On the economy, more than half of MailOnline readers who took part in the survey – 55 per cent – do not think that wealth should be redistributed from the richest to the poorest, while 27 per cent said it should.

Exploiting shale gas trapped deep underground is backed by 51 per cent of those people who took part in the survey on MailOnline last month

People convicted of less serous crimes should avoid prison, according to 53 per cent of MailOnline readers

47 per cent of people said restricting citizen privacy was acceptable to combat crime, with 37 per cent disagreeing 

Just 12 per cent of people who took part in the survey said the UK should welcome a larger number of asylum seekers from war-torn countries

The top rate of tax should be cut further from 45p, according to 44 per cent of readers while 39 per cent disagreed.

More than three-quarters said that when a state rescues a bank it should take control of it while more than half of people said the government should go ahead with the exploitation of underground shale gas through the process known as fracking.

On law and order, restrictions on citizen privacy to combat crime are backed by 47 per cent of readers, but opposed by 37 per cent.

More than half of those who took part – 54 per cent – said less serious crimes should be punished with community service and not prison, with 35 per cent disagreeing.

Only 12 per cent said the UK should welcome a larger number of asylum seekers from war-torn countries, with 71 per cent saying they disagreed.

Dr. Matthew Wall, Lecturer of Political and Cultural Studies, Swansea University added: ‘The huge amount of readers that took the quiz has provided us with remarkable level of insight and understanding about how Mail Online readers feel about the issues being brought up by the European Elections.

‘What’s perhaps most interesting is the relatively even split over whether the UK should remain in the EU. It’s certainly going to make for an interesting election come May 22nd.'
