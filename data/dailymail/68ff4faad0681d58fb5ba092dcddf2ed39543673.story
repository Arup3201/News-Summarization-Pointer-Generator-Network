Five-year-old Chloe Johnson drowned in a hotel swimming pool during a family holiday in Sharm el-Sheikh

The devastated mother of a five-year-old British girl who drowned at an Egyptian holiday resort last night claimed no lifeguards were on duty when the tragedy happened.

Sarah Thompson revealed how she and her partner had left their daughter Chloe Johnson playing at the side of the resort’s shallow toddler pool with a friend for five minutes  while they fetched drinks.

But Chloe wandered into a wave pool yards away and was found lying unconscious at the side of the pool.

‘She was playing with her little friend,’ said Ms Thompson, 32.  ‘I explained to her twice, called her, told her exactly where  we were before we went to  get a drink.’

Ms Thompson, from Forest Hill, South London, said there were no lifeguards at the pool and staff at the Coral Sea Waterworld Resort in Sharm-el-Sheik made no attempt to resuscitate her daughter, leaving Chloe’s dad Tony, 43, to attempt mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

Ms Thompson also revealed that Chloe had survived open-heart surgery when she was just two days old. ‘I am just empty without her,’ she added.

Chloe’s grandparents April and Gordon Johnson say it took four hours for emergency services  to arrive after Friday’s tragedy.

Mrs Johnson, 67, from Welling, Kent, said: ‘My son was looking for Chloe and a man came running along with her in his arms. We are angry and so hurt. We can’t understand why there were no lifeguards on duty.’

Chloe was taken to her hotel room until an ambulance arrived. The Johnsons claim  it came four hours later.

Tragedy: Chloe Johnson was on holiday with her family when the tragedy happened in a waterpark

Asked how the family was feeling, in an interview with Sky News April Johnson said: 'Angry, angry, angry and so hurt.

'We have all got knives in our hearts to think that if she had been seen, would she still be with us?

'Where
 were the lifeguards? Even if they didn't see her when she was pulled 
out of the pool, why did they not come forward and start resuscitation? 
Why was it left to other people?

'I can't get my head around that one. I need to know why to put Chloe at rest and try to help my son as best I can.' 

She
 described Chloe as 'a lovely, lovely girl' who was 'intelligent for her
 age' and said the family were 'devastated' by her death. 

The waterpark had only opened at the beginning of this month, according to BBC correspondent James Pearce.

The tragedy is being investigated by local police and tour operator First Choice.

A spokesman for the holiday company said: 'First Choice can sadly confirm that a child has 
died while staying at the Coral Sea Waterworld hotel in Egypt.

'The 
incident occurred in a pool in the hotel's waterpark. Our thoughts and condolences are with the family at this extremely 
difficult time.

'The British Consulate were immediately informed and they
 are now working with our dedicated resort team in Egypt, to offer every
 assistance possible to the family in resort.

'In partnership with the hotelier, our resort team are working to 
understand how the incident occurred, and we will be carrying out a full
 and thorough investigation.

'At this time our priority is to provide 
support to the family.'

The Foreign Office said: “We are 
aware of the death of a British national in Sharm el-Sheikh on May 17. 
We are providing consular assistance.”

Sharm
 el-Sheikh is a popular holiday destination overlooking the Red Sea, 
located on the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula, in Egypt.

It
 has a population of about 35,000 and is a popular destination for 
British tourists. About a million tourists from the UK visited Egypt 
last year, according to travel association ABTA.

But
 the number has dropped by about half a million since the start of the 
political unrest which came with the Arab Spring in 2011.

The Coral Sea Hotels and
 Resorts website, says the Waterworld hotel is 'a magnificent 
resort leaving nothing to be desired' and is 'set amid colourful 
landscape gardens and the resort two pools'.

It is described as a 'perfect setting
 for complete relaxation', as well as being 'an ideal venue for many 
exciting activities'. It is on Nabq Bay and has 369 rooms.

An ABTA spokeswoman told the BBC there had been no concerns regarding water parks in the region in recent times.

She said: 'There is a lot of focus on health and safety in water parks because they are often visited by families with children and major tour operators will have very strict criteria in place.'

Ashraf Khalil, the general manager of the Coral Sea Waterworld, told the Press Association: 'The hotel is waiting to finalise its investigation into what happened together with the official investigation of the Egyptian district attorney and Egyptian police.

'We are also, in collaboration with First Choice, flying in investigators from the UK today. We want to see the facts and the most important fact here is that our hearts and souls are with the family and with little Chloe.

'We have moved them from the scene of the hotel so they can at least not be in premises where the accident happened.

'We are taking care of them so they are not bothered in this time of grief and we wish to express our deepest condolences to them. We are sorry this has happened. When the investigation concludes we will be able to give answers.'
