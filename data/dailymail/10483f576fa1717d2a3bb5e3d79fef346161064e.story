The Duchess of Cambridge is to undertake her first official public engagement since the birth of her baby on September 12, palace sources have confirmed.

Kate, and her husband, Prince William, will be guests of honour at the inaugural Tusk Conservation Awards, Mail Online can reveal.

It will be the Duchess’s first royal job since Prince George was born on July 22, although she is still formally on maternity leave.

Duty calls: Kate, pictured outside the Lindo Wing the day after she gave birth to Prince George on 22 July, will attend the inaugural Tusk Conservation Awards on September 12

Fashion watchers will no doubt be keeping a keen eye on Kate’s first post-baby outfit given her immensely stylish maternity wardrobe.

She also earned worldwide plaudits for her appearance on the steps of the Lindo Wing the day after giving birth wearing a chic baby blue polka-dot dress by British designer Jenny Packham, showing off her still prominent baby bump.

The event next month has been organised by Tusk Trust, a UK charity that funds African conservation projects of which William is patron. 

He is a passionate supporter of their work and has visited many of the charity’s projects in Africa – which accounts for the Duchess’s decision to leave baby George at home and join him.It is not clear yet who will be baby-sitting the new third in line to the throne, but it is most likely to fall to her mother, Carole Middleton.

Hard at it: Prince William yesterday carried out his first solo public engagement since becoming a father when he handled a Harris Hawk, during a falconry display at the Anglesey Show, in Anglesey, North Wales

Kate went to live with her parents at their home in Bucklebury, Berkshire, for almost a month after George was born and friends say Carole has taken to being a grandmother for the first time with gusto.

The Tusk Conservation Awards will honour the unsung heroes of wildlife conservation. The Duke and Duchess will meet the nominees at a private reception beforehand. 

A Kensington Palace spokesman confirmed today that the Duchess would be attending. ‘It is a long standing engagements,’ they told MailOnline.

William has also given his first interview since the birth of Prince George to CNN’s Royal Correspondent Max Foster, it was also confirmed today.

In a documentary entitled Prince William’s Passion: New Father, New Hope the prince talks passionately about his conservation work and new baby George - particularly his hope that his son will continue that work.

William is a patron of Tusk Trust and has long been involved in raising awareness surrounding issues of conservation. Here he feeds a 5-year-old black rhino called Zawadi as he visits Port Lympne Wild Animal Park

Some of Tusk Trust's work involves protecting rhinos which are killed, usually shot, by poachers who can sell their horns for the equivalent of several months' salary

The interview will be broadcast on CNN internationally and also on ITV in the UK on 15 September at 10pm, although excerpts will be released next week.

The interview with the prince will be part of a one-hour special, chronicling the Prince’s passion for Africa and his dream to save the world’s most endangered species. 

As a new father, the Prince discusses his hope that one day his son can experience the same Africa that he and Prince Harry did as young boys.

The brothers were visitors to Africa with their parents and continue to visit the continent regularly – indeed William proposed to his wife in Kenya, while Prince Harry has just concluded a working trip to Angola.

William also reflects on becoming a new parent and how it has forever changed him. 

The Royal Family has worked on conservation in Africa for generations.  In Prince William’s Passion:  New Father, New Hope, William  discusses how he is continuing the tradition. 

His love of Africa and its endangered species were instilled in him by his father Prince Charles, and late mother Princess Diana.  

The Duke of Cambridge also highlights some of the incredible work done by individuals in the area of conservation, including Tusk.
