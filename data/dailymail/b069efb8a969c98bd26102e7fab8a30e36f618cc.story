Here, ALISON SMITH-SQUIRE tells one nominee's story.

Cradling their longed-for twins should have been the most joyous moment for Julia and Tony Rees.

But Oliver and Maisie were born just 23 weeks into Julia’s pregnancy — too premature to survive. They died five hours later in their parents’ arms.

Dream come true: After multiple miscarriages, Julia and Tony Rees now have a daughter, Ruby

Just a year earlier, Julia had miscarried twin boys at 17 weeks. In fact, Oliver and Maisie were the seventh and eighth babies the couple had lost after ten cycles of IVF over eight years. ‘The emptiness we felt, the loss, was indescribably painful,’ recalls Julia, 38, from Caerphilly in Wales. ‘We’d given up almost any hope of ever having a baby.’

When Julia, a former customer services assistant, became pregnant again, their happiness was tempered with anxiety about whether their hopes would be dashed again. It was all so overwhelming that at an 11-week antenatal check, Julia broke down in tears.

The doctor doing the scan was Dr Bryan Beattie, consultant in foetal medicine at University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff.

‘He looked at my medical history and said he would personally ensure this time we’d go home with a baby,’ recalls Julia. ‘There was something about the way he talked, the way he took control and spoke in such a positive way  that made me feel for the first time there was a chance things would be all right.

‘Unlike other doctors, who passed us to one of their huge teams, Bryan was always personally available. He even did my scans himself.’

Health hero: Dr Beattie gave the parents hope and support

Dr Beattie arranged for Julia to be one of the first women in the UK to have the cutting-edge foetal fibronectin test to warn of premature labour. The couple could text him ‘about even the smallest worry’.

‘How many patients can text their busy consultant day or night and know they will always get a text back?’ asks Julia.

Julia and her husband Tony, 47, an engineer, have no doubt that if it hadn’t been for Dr Beattie, they would not be the thrilled parents of Ruby, now two.

‘When you desperately want a child and your hopes are raised, then so cruelly dashed, you just can’t describe what meeting a specialist like Bryan means,’ says Julia.

Julia suffered the first of her miscarriages in 2002. The pregnancy was ectopic — where the foetus develops in the fallopian tube instead of the uterus. The embryo and both Julia’s fallopian tubes had to be removed.

After eight heartbreaking miscarriages, having spent close to £80,000 on IVF cycles, the couple decided to have one last attempt. ‘We simply couldn’t afford more emotionally or financially,’ says Julia.

With Dr Beattie’s help, Ruby was born naturally at 37 weeks in December 2010. The labour lasted just an hour-and-a-half and she weighed a healthy 7lb 3oz. 

‘The moment she was placed in my arms and looked up at me will stay with Tony and me for ever,’ says Julia. ‘Even now we pinch ourselves — we can hardly believe we have such a gorgeous little girl.’

Luan Pessall, 38, a clinical psychologist from Cardiff, was also referred to Dr Beattie after previously miscarrying twins.

During her second pregnancy, again with twins, she went into labour at just 33 weeks.

‘Bryan was on holiday when I sent him a text at 6am,’ Luan says. ‘Despite being hundreds of miles away, he rang the hospital to make sure two intensive-care cots were available and that they knew it had to be an emergency caesarean.’

Luan is now expecting a third baby. ‘I would never have gone ahead with another pregnancy if I couldn’t count on Bryan’s care.’

Dr Beattie recently set up a charity running free events about fertility and antenatal care, and he’s campaigning for the foetal fibronectin test to be introduced into routine antenatal care from 22 weeks.

‘Premature birth accounts for  40 per cent of baby deaths. This test could not only save the lives of tiny babies but save millions of pounds, too,’ he says.

Dr Beattie has also campaigned for a blood test for Down’s syndrome at ten weeks and screening for group B streptococcus, a common bacteria that can cause a baby’s death. ‘As a dad myself, I’ve always felt being able to have children is a gift. I am driven by the joy I know my patients realise when they have a healthy baby,’ says Dr Beattie, a father-of-three.

‘At the same time, obstetrics sometimes involves heartbreaking decisions for parents-to-be. I want to make sure that even when there has been a bad outcome, they know that somebody cares.’
