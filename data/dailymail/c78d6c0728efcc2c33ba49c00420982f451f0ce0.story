'Loveable rogue': Thomas McAnea pictured leaving the the High Court in Edinburgh in 2007, when he was jailed for six years

On the face of it, he ran a tiny printer’s shop, apparently producing nothing more exciting than menus for Chinese restaurants.

Behind the scenes, however, Thomas McAnea was a master forger at the centre of a major counterfeiting operation with the power to threaten Britain’s economic stability.

Nicknamed ‘Hologram Tam’, McAnea relied on just a few simple tools – a pair of spectacles, a magnifying glass and an engraving pen – to produce the detailing on fake banknotes so authentic that by the time he was caught nearly £700,000 worth were in circulation.

Yet, despite his fabled ability to conjure up dodgy currency, McAnea, whose death from lung cancer at the age of 63 was reported yesterday, could scarcely be said to have cashed in on his dubious talents.

Police sources say he appeared to have barely two pennies to rub together at his death and, in the greatest of ironies, the illness which killed him is believed to have been caused by a lifetime spent inhaling toxic printing fumes.

A family friend said: ‘Tam was a lovable rogue but one of the biggest names in crime.

‘It’s a bit ironic he got lung cancer from printing – the job where he made his name as the forgery master. There will be a big turnout at his funeral.’

McAnea, who died at his home in Glasgow on Friday, was jailed for six years and four months in 2007 after he was unmasked as the ringleader of a professional gang which had the capacity to pump out  £2million worth of fake notes a day.

His tiny shop, Print Link (Scotland), at St George’s Cross, Glasgow, appeared to offer small-scale printing, mainly menus for Chinese restaurants.

But its proximity to the M8 allied to the forger’s peerless skills with holograms made it attractive to criminals from all over the UK.

Police became interested in the shop after a tip-off from the Metropolitan Police that an unusually large number of fake Bank of Scotland £20 notes were in circulation in London.

McAnea, who became the number one target of Operation Fender launched in October 2005, was already on the police’s radar.

Convicted: This picture, taken in 1998 when McAnea was aged 48, was at his trial for forgery which landed him a 10-year stretch, although this was later overturned

In 1998, he and sidekick John McGregor were sentenced to ten years in prison for an earlier plot to flood the market with £1.6million of fake notes via unwitting Scottish fans attending the Euro 96 football championships in England.

In 2000, however, both were freed on appeal and had their convictions quashed on a technicality – ironically related to a misprint on a warrant.

In 2007, they were not so lucky. When detectives from the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency (SCDEA) raided Print Link, McGregor was caught red-handed printing £500,000 in Bank of Scotland £20 notes.

The gang also had in their possession  €500,000 (£350,000) in forged notes.

Following the raid, another £672,880 worth of counterfeit notes was recovered from the banking system, although one police source said at the time: ‘Some of Hologram Tam’s money is still out there. If I gave you one of his notes, you wouldn’t know it.’

Detectives also found templates for other forgeries including passports, driving licences, ID cards, bank statements, utility bills, MoT certificates, postage and saving stamps and TV licences.

A photograph of judge Lord Cameron, who had freed McAnea and McGregor on appeal seven years earlier, adorned the wall of the print room, below which was scrawled: ‘Go on yersel big man’.

At the High Court in Edinburgh, McAnea admitted delivering, selling and disposing of fake money between October 2006 and January 2007.

Five other gang members were also jailed for a total of 16 years.

McAnea’s defence counsel said that he turned to drink after losing two sons, one aged two, and the other aged 22 after a drugs overdose.

He had also run up debts and a previous business collapsed owing £15,000. To make ends meet, he offered to help organised gangs.

Gangs: The proximity of McAnea's dodgy business near the M8 made it an attractive proposition with criminal gangs all over the country

Yet, as the gangs profited, McAnea had no assets worth seizing at the time of his arrest. All officers could find was a battered old BMW, while his flat in Glasgow’s Yorkhill area was mortgaged to the hilt.

One SCDEA source said: ‘We expected to see him drinking champagne or going to lap dancing bars. But the only place he went was the pub or to buy messages.’

Scottish Labour Justice Spokesman Graeme Pearson, who was director of the SCDEA when McAnea was caught, said the former print union official ‘had the touch of the geek about him’, but added: ‘People think it’s a bit of a wheeze, a  B movie, producing banknotes in your kitchen, but in actual fact what we have is something that enables criminal gangs to profit.

‘This counterfeiting gang had the ability to destabilise the British economy.’ 

McAnea’s funeral is due to take place tomorrow at Anniesland, Glasgow. Last night, his partner Lesley-Anne McKinnon was too upset to comment.
