It isn't wise to get too close to a monkey - even if it is behind bars.

One tourist discovered this to his cost when he peered into a cage while filming some furry locals near a restaurant in Koh Samui,Thailand.

Stu Lang filmed one monkey eating a mango before attempting a close-up shot of another monkey behind bars

Having 
filmed one monkey happily munching on a mango, Stuart Langrish then moves 
around to the other side of the cage get a closer look at one of the monkey's friends.

As he bends down to get a better shot, the cheeky inmate immediately reaches out through the bars and snatches the phone out the man’s hand.

To add insult to injury, he then slaps the man’s girlfriend, who can be heard to scream out.

Having grabbed the phone, the monkey turned the camera on himself before filming his lunch on the floor

The nimble thief then appears to take a selfie with the camera before trying to eat the phone.

After realising it doesn't taste all that good he decides to film his lunch on the floor instead.

Mr Langrish eventually got the phone back, complete with added teeth marks.
