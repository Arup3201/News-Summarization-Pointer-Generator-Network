A road bike freestyler risked life and limb while traversing a railing over a 65-ft high cliff for a TV programme that is trying to find the world's most talented person.

Vittorio Brumotti, who is representing Italy in the interactive talent show, 'World's Most Talented', fought the wind on the seafront during his challenge before safely completing it.

Watched by David Brain, one of the show’s presenters, who filmed the feat on a tablet, the fearless cyclist skilfully jumps onto the top of a wall to begin the stunt.

The extreme cyclist put his life on the line and displayed incredible concentration during the stunt 

Approaching the railing, the road bike freestyler steadies himself and gets into position with a series of small bunny hops. 

As Vittorio, 34, cycles along the narrow railing with one leg in the air for balance, footage from his helmet camera shows the drop to the sea to his right and the jagged rocks that stick out from the wall.

A number of observers look on nervously behind recording phones, while David looks genuinely petrified for Vittorio.

Finally the road bike freestyler reaches the end of the railing and after putting two feet back on the pedals jumps down onto the path safely.

The video concludes with the crowd of observers clapping while David bows and laughs in disbelief at what he has just witnessed.

David said: ‘Going along the edge of a building, that’s not just physical, that’s mental. That blew me away.’

After the stunt Vittorio, a former bike trial world champion, reflected on the dangers involved.

Beachgoers and a film crew looked on in suspense as the 34-year-old completed the stunt

He said: ‘I think about my mum, because it is important to me to come back to my mum. It’s important to have fear, because without fear, you go down.’

Vittorio holds a total of 10 Guinness World Records for his extreme talent and claims to have always enjoyed riding bikes. He once climbed Dubai's Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest tower, by hopping up the stairs on his bicycle.

He said: ‘I started when I was eleven years old, my father and mother bought me the first bike and it was magic, this is my dream.’

'World's Most Talented' airs on every Tuesday at 9pm from 31 March.
