A teacher has been arrested after allegedly bringing brass knuckles and a methamphetamine pipe into an elementary school in Texas. 

Jake Contreras, a 'paraprofessional redirection aide' who worked on student behavior, was detained when police searched his backpack at Frank Madla Elementary School in San Antonio.

In the bag, officers reportedly found a set of brass knuckles and a pipe that tested positive for traces of methamphetamine after receiving an anonymous tip earlier this week.

Contreras, who may have also been carrying a knife, was taken into custody and questioned following the discovery by South San Antonio Independent School District officers.

He was later charged with possession of a weapon in a prohibited place and possession of a controlled substance in a drug-free zone.

The teacher, who was seen staring forlornly at the camera in a red top in his mugshot, resigned immediately from his job following his arrest on Wednesday, police told KENS-TV.

He has been released from the Bexar County Jail on $30,000 bond. Online jail records did not list an attorney.

It is not the first time an American teacher has been charged in relation to methamphetamine.

Earlier this month, Alexander Rudine, 38, from Portland, Oregon, was arrested on suspicion of possessing, delivering and manufacturing the drug near an elementary school.

The chemistry teacher at Mount Hood Community College has denied the felony charges.
