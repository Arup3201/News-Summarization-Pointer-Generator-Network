Cesc Fabregas believes Chelsea's win against Swansea on Saturday was vital to ensure the Blues took advantage of Manchester City's draw with Arsenal.

Jose Mourinho's side eventually strolled to a 4-2 win against the Swans, largely thanks to a Diego Costa hat-trick shortly after City played out a 2-2 draw with the Gunners.

Fabregas bagged his third and fourth assists of the season during the Stamford Bridge clash, but was more concerned about his new side getting one over on their title rivals.

The Spanish midfielder claims he feels 'comfortable' after bagging four assists this season

He told Chelsea's official website: 'Obviously we wanted three points as usual, but the more we take advantage of our rivals the better.

'We know it doesn’t mean much because there is still a long way to go but we knew [before the game] Manchester City and Arsenal had dropped points so it was very important.

The Spanish midfielder also revealed how settled he feels in a Chelsea shirt after a bright start to his Blues career.

He added: ‘I feel comfortable, I feel good, I feel happy,’ declared Fabregas. The Premier League season is very long so we have to keep it up until the end.'
