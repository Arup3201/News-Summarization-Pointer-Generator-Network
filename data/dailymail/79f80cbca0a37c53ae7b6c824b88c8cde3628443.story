He was born into a home which could not have been further removed from privilege.

Michael Ha, 21, grew up in an East London council house with Chinese parents who spoke little English and got by on benefits, and attended an inner-city state school once branded the ‘worst in Britain’.

But when, at the age of ten, the youngster set his heart on going to Cambridge University, he decided no amount of adversity was going to hinder him.

Now, after becoming an A-grade A-level pupil, he is the star medical student of St John’s College, Cambridge, and has just won an award for academic excellence.

Telling of his rise to success yesterday, he said he hoped he could be an inspiration for other youngsters from disadvantaged backgrounds.

He said: ‘My parents couldn’t find work because their English wasn’t up to scratch. It was tough but we made do. I never knew any different.’

Michael’s father, Bao Van Ha, 67, worked as a factory welder in Vietnam before moving to Britain in 1980 with his wife Yen Thang Trinh, 58, a seamstress.

The family lived in a small terrace house in Hackney – an area known for petty crime and gang problems.

Michael, the youngest of four siblings, said: ‘There was always trouble on the streets of Hackney. There were times when it got scary. A couple of times people tried to mug me. But I managed to stay out of trouble. I just kept my head down.’

At 11 Michael started at the new Mossbourne Academy, which had replaced Hackney Downs School – described by a Tory government as ‘the worst school in Britain’.

The new school was run by inspirational headteacher Sir Michael Wilshaw, who is now chief inspector of schools at Ofsted.

As well as passing his A-levels with flying colours, Michael also got an A in AS-level further maths – after teaching himself from a textbook in just four months ‘as a bet’ with a friend.

‘I always saw Cambridge as this mythical place where the best would go,’ Michael said. ‘I was really ambitious and I dreamt of going there myself.’

Michael applied for St John’s College to do medicine – one of the most competitive courses. He will resume his medical studies at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge and hopes to become a reconstructive surgeon.

‘I want other people to know they shouldn’t be afraid of Cambridge and Oxford,’ he said.

‘All the tutors are looking for is the brightest people in the country. If you work hard, it will be within your grasp.’
