A Texas family law judge seen beating his older daughter in a video she posted on YouTube has been placed under a temporary restraining order, which his ex-wife's attorney says effectively prevents him from visiting his younger daughter.

Under the order issued Thursday by another judge, Aransas County Court-at-Law Judge William Adams is forbidden from visiting his 10-year-old daughter without getting permission from the girl's mother, his ex-wife.

The order also says Adams can't disparage the woman or drink alcohol within 24 hours of seeing his child.

History of violence: Hillary Adams said she was regularly beaten by her father

the hands of Judge William Adams at their home in Rockport, Texas

Brett Pritchard, the attorney for 
Adams' ex-wife Hallie Adams, said in a prepared statement that the 
ruling 'temporarily terminates the visitation between Judge Adams and 
his younger child'.

William Adams' attorney did not respond to a request for comment Friday from The Associated Press.

State District Judge Kemper Stephen 
Williams scheduled a hearing for Nov. 21 to decide on Hallie Adams' 
request to have William Adams' visitation denied or require that it be 
supervised.

William Adams has not held court since his 23-year-old 
daughter Hillary Adams released a secretly-recorded 2004 video of him 
beating her with a belt.

Disciplinarian: Judge Adams faced public calls for his resignation after the video went viral

William Adams faced public calls for his resignation and threats after Hillary Adams posted the 8-minute clip on YouTube that shows her father viciously lashing her with a belt and trying to force her to bend over her bed to be beaten despite her pleas to stop.

Hallie Adams filed an affidavit Thursday claiming a dysfunctional 22-year marriage and conflict that continued since their 2007 divorce. Pritchard said the furious reaction to the video triggered the legal move.

'The impetus is she (Hallie Adams) doesn't feel at first that her daughter is safe going down there to be with the judge right now,' Pritchard said. 'The impetus now is the result of the video, not necessarily the video itself.'

The district attorney and federal prosecutors both declined to bring charges against William Adams, but the State Commission on Judicial Conduct continues its investigation.

Last week, Rockport Police Chief Tim Jayroe said that police did not interview the younger daughter, but asked both Hallie and Hillary Adams about it and there was no indication of abuse of the younger daughter.

It comes after police revealed the judge would not face criminal charges because too much time has passed.

Adams likely would have faced
charges of causing injury to a child or other assault-related offences 
for the savage 2004 beating.

But the five-year statutes of limitations expired so the Aransas County Court-at-Law Judge probably won't be charged for beating the cerebral palsy sufferer, Rockport Police Chief Tim Jayroe said.

It came shortly after the judge's wife and 
daughter appeared in a televised interview to reveal that she had been hiding her
husband's 'secret of addiction for a long time.'

Hallie Adams appeared with her 
daughter Hillary to describe years of abuse in their 'dysfunctional' family and 
Hillary revealed her father dared her to post the video online.

Hillary Adams also told CNN’s Anderson 
Cooper that she uploaded the video to make it clear her father was in 
‘some denial about the way you are treating me and my mother’.

‘I thought he was a monster,’ she 
added. ‘I thought that I was a witch. I really don't know what the 
solution for him is. Except that I really want him to seek some kind of 
help.’

attack on his daughter Hillary, who suffers from cerebral palsy 'was not
as bad as it looks'

The judge was granted joint custody of his 10-year-old daughter in his 2007 divorce.

Hallie Adams, who also appeared 
in the video, tried to explain why she too had hit her daughter and 
stood aside to let her husband attack.

She said: 'My answer to you and to the world is
something that I've been hiding for a very long time is a family secret
and that's addiction.'

When asked if she has an addiction, 
the mother said no but when asked if her ex-husband did, she told the 
interviewer: 'Yes sir.' She offered no further explanation as to what the addiction might be.

Hallie Adams added: 'I lived in an 
environment of dysfunction and it steadily got worse. I 
did leave him... but he shamed me into going back.' 

Hillary Adams, now 23, said she had 
forgiven her mother and did not regret making the video public. It has been viewed more than a million times.

'We're very close now,' Hillary said.

Speaking to the Today show, she said: 'I told him I had the video... and he dared me to post it.'

Judge Adams, who presides mainly over cases involving children, remained unrepentant.

He released a three-page statement earlier this month, saying his daughter posted the clip to get back at him for telling her he would be reducing the amount of financial support he gives her and taking away her Mercedes.

The statement did not include an apology for the beating, but he told Corpus Christi television station KZTV that the video 'looks worse than it is,' that he had already apologized to his daughter and that he was just disciplining his child for stealing.

Miss
Adams, who has suffered from ataxic cerebral palsy from birth, said her 
condition causes problems including difficulty with balance, shaky 
movements of hands or feet, and difficulty with speech.

Hillary Adams was asked by the Today Show how she felt about the ordeal she had suffered now.

Miss
Adams said: 'I've experienced everything from crying about it to 
laughing.'

She added: 'It did happen regularly 
for a period of time, and I could tell because of the pattern that 
things were escalating again, so I set up my video camera on the dresser
and covered the little red light with a scarf.

'About half an hour after I set the camera up this happened and it was amazing that I was able to capture such a thing.'

Miss
Adams explained that she waited seven years to release the video 
because she feared for her safety and that of her mother and younger 
sister.

Hallie Adams said: 'I was completely brainwashed and controlled. I did every single thing that he did. When I leave the room he is telling me what to say, what to do.'

The video, entitled 'Family law judge beats own daughter for using the internet, please spread', shows the motive for the attack was because Miss Adams, who suffers from cerebral palsy, had been caught downloading music to the computer in her bedroom.

In the footage, Judge Adams can be seen delivering around 
ten powerful strikes across his daughter's legs and backside. His wife then grabs 
the belt from him to take over, at which point he walks out only to 
return moments later with another belt so he can continue beating her.

On the seven-minute long clip, as his daughter begs him to stop he can be heard snarling: 'Bend over the f***ing bed.

Widespread viewing: After the video was uploaded to YouTube by Hillary 
Adams, it was then posted on Reddit and thousands more times across the 
Internet

Demands: A Facebook page Don't Re-Elect Judge William Adams was set up shortly after the video was released

'Lay down or I'll spank you in the f***ing face.'

In total the girl receives 20 hard lashes from her father and one from her mother.

The mother screams: 'You turn over like a 16-year-old and take it like a grown woman.'

As the child lies crying on her bed, 
her father shouts: 'Do you want to put some more computer games on? Are 
you happy disobeying your parents?

'You don't deserve to be in this f***ing house. What happened to you Hillary?'

The shocking footage appeared to have 
been filmed on a webcam set up in the bedroom and dates from 
2004 but only became public on October 27.

Judge Adams said that he informed the Judicial Review board himself after seeing the video had been posted online by his daughter.

In a court judgement last October, 
Judge Adams said that a child's statements 'amounted to no evidence' 
despite the fact the child's words had been confirmed by third party witnesses 
and recorded on video several times.

Judge Adams also agreed with a lawyer who claimed all children are 'fantasisers' and their testimony should just be ignored.
