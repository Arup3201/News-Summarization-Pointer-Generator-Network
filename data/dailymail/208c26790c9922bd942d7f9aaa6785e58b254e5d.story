A die hard fan of rock star Kid Rock got the surprise of a lifetime when the singer turned up to his birthday party on Monday to wish him a happy birthday.

Dan McGurk, from Toledo, Ohio, was celebrating his 30th birthday with family and friends at the Clarkston Union restaurant in downtown Clarkston, Michigan.

McGurk, who has Down's Syndrome, had been working to get a party invitation to Rock for months and even posted a Youtube video asking him to come to his party.

But he never expected the busy star to actually turn up. 

In a video posted on Youtube on October 28, McGurk is seen sitting at a table celebrating his big day.

He is given a cake, with candles and then listens to a bad rendition of Happy Birthday sung by a friend before making a wish for what he really wanted.

He then blows out his birthday candles and says, ‘My wish is that the American Bad Ass is here,’ referring to the 2000 Kid Rock tune.

Suddenly, he lights up with sheer delight as Rock strolls in singing ‘Happy Birthday.’

'I've been waiting for this ...Kid Rock finally came to my birthday,' he said. 

'He came in singing happy birthday and my face light up and I as so excited to meet kid rock,' he told WTOL-TV.

The singer, known for his brief year-long marriage to Pamela Anderson and chart topping hits like All Summer Long and Bawitdaba puts his arm around McGurk and says hello.

He is greeted by a look of sheer delight plastered over his number one fan's face. 

The singer, whose real name is Robert James Ritchie, then sits down to chat with McGurk before presenting him with several gifts, including a custom Kid Rock guitar. 

He also promises him tickets to his next concert. 

McGurk had posted a YouTube video in August showing off his sizable collection of Kid Rock gear and announcing, ‘Hi, my name's Dan and I'm the No. 1 Kid Rock fan.’ 

The clip got thousands of views and through social media and word of mouth Rock heard about McGurk's invitation through friends, the artist's publicist said Wednesday.
