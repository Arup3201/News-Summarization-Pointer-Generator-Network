Cristiano Ronaldo may have picked up his second consecutive FIFA Ballon d'Or award earlier this month, but what will no doubt be a memorable night for the Real Madrid star is probably remembered more by others for that celebration. 

True to form, the world of social media picked up on his 'roar' of glory when he lifted the illustrious World Player of the Year gong, cutting him into videos with the likes of Taylor Swift and Katy Perry.

But new smart phone app 'Dubsmash' - that allows users to dub over sound clips with their own footage - was the weapon of choice on Wednesday for Roma star Francesco Totti.

The 38-year-old Serie A veteran may be getting on a bit, but he certainly knows how to treat his fans using the latest technology.

Posting his clip on Vine, the Italian filmed himself miming along to Ronaldo's extravagant bellowing and even got his friends in on the act.

Totti also made the headlines recently when he posted a selfie after scoring an equaliser for Roma in the famous Lazio derby.
