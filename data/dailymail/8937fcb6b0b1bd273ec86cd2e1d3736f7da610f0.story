Sergio Aguero allayed Manchester City fans' fears that he could be set for another lengthy injury layoff after being substituted for Edin Dzeko for the closing 20 minutes of their win over Stoke. 

The Argentine marksman scored in each half, once from the penalty spot, before being taken off after 73 minutes in as Manuel Pellegrini's side dismantled Mark Hughes' men 4-1 at the Britannia.

'For the ones asking I'm OK,' he posted on Twitter in English and Spanish. 'I stepped out only for precaution. Now let's keep on working for the very important upcoming commitments.'

But the Argentine striker tells Twitter followers 'I'm OK. I stepped out only for precaution.'

Aguero's eventful night included the best and worst of the prolific striker as he found the net for the first time since his return from a knee injury.

The unlikely stage of a cold night in Stoke was what he needed to get back on the score sheet but it was far from a supportive crowd, especially after he handled into the back of the back in an act reminiscent of his countryman Diego Maradona's 'hand of god'.

Aguero's opener after 33 minutes was a gem as he showed his superior power and balance against Marc Muniesa, beat Phil Bardsley and shot clinically beyond Asmir Begovic.

Peter Crouch's equaliser five minutes later saw the sides go to the break on level terms. 

City thought they'd reclaimed the lead when Aguero was celebrating his second but replays clearly showed his 'glove of god' moment and the Britannia crowd let him know about it. 

After consultation with his assistant referee Lee Mason disallowed the goal and booked the striker, who spent the rest of his night as the villain in a panto such were the boos from Stoke's faithful.

The City striker could have headed it in following good work from David Silva but put the ball in with his hand

Nevertheless, City were soon ahead legitimately through a James Milner header 10 minutes into the second period. 

And when City won a penalty Aguero, of course, stepped up to drill it high into Begovic's net for his 21st goal of the season. 

With the arrival of Wilfried Bony imminent it was a poignant time for Aguero to remind those around him why he's regarded the Premier League's most dangerous striker.
