Two children have been rescued from squalor after sheriffs found them living in a home where feces covered the walls and rooms were caked in mold and rotting food.

The two-year-old girls - who have not been named - were found in a stinking home in Venice, Florida, after law enforcement were called to a disturbance at the house.

Elizabeth Davis, 32, and Wesley Benoit, 35, were arrested and charged with child neglect for allowing the girls, who were found unclothed and not wearing diapers, to live there.

Parents: Elizabeth Davis, 32, and Wesley Benoit, 35, were charged with child neglect. Davis said that she cleans regularly and didn't think her home was messy

A grim police report describes a house where floors, walls and even some ceilings were smeared with feces, urine and other garbage.

The children's bedroom, according to the deputies, was particularly ridden by feces.

In the bathroom, the shower contained a kiddie pool reportedly filled with stagnant water covered in a brown film, while mold coated the floor.

In the kitchen, the report said, there were dirty dishes and pans piled high, with decaying food inside.

In the sink sheriffs described stagnant water covered with a white, milky film, while an outside patio was reportedly covered in garbage and cigarette butts. 

According to NBC2, Davis told deputies that she cleaned the house every day and didn't think the conditions were a problem.

Reports said that when talking to sheriffs after their arrest both said the other was a 'danger' to their children.
