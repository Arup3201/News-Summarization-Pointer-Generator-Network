A pregnant teenager from the Dominican Republican has died from leukemia complications this week after her mother said the hospital had delayed her chemotherapy treatment due to the Caribbean nation’s stringent anti-abortion laws.

Doctors at Semma Hospital in Santo Domingo were reluctant to give Rosa Hernandez’s 16-year-old daughter her chemotherapy because it could terminate the pregnancy, which is against the law in the island nation where the Catholic Church remains a powerful force.

According to Article 37 of the Dominican Constitution, which was passed in 2009, ‘the right to life is inviolable from the moment of conception and until death.’

Heartbroken: Rosa Hernandez said she tried to convince the Dominican government to make an exception for her daughter and approve her chemotherapy, but to no avail

Dominican courts have interpreted Article 37 as a strict ban on abortion even in extreme cases of incest, rape and malformation of the fetus, CNN reported.

A Dominican doctor who provides chemotherapy treatment for a pregnant patient that results in the termination of the pregnancy may find himself in legal trouble. As a result, medics are afraid to carry out the procedure because it’s unconstitutional.

Hernandez said she tried to convince the Dominican government and the doctors to make an exception for her daughter in order to safe her young life, but her pleas fell on deaf ears.

‘My daughter's life is first,’ she told CNN. ‘I know that (abortion) is a sin and that it goes against the law…but my daughter's health is first.’

Hernandez said her daughter, who has not been identified due to her age, started getting treatment for her illness only 20 days after being admitted to the hospital. On Friday, she passed away, according to Dr Antonio Cabrera, the legal representative for the hospital.

‘They have killed me, I'm dead, dead. I'm nothing,’ the girl’s grieving mother said. ‘She was the reason for my existence. I no longer live. Rosa has died. Let the world know that Rosa is dead.’

The body of the teen, dubbed ‘Esperanctia’ in the press, rejected a blood transfusion and did not respond to the chemotherapy, and her condition worsened, Cabrera said.

National debate: Dominican Minister of Health Bautista Rojas Gomez said he favored chemotherapy over protecting the girl's pregnancy

The teen, who was 13 weeks pregnant, suffered a miscarriage early Friday. She then went into cardiac arrest, and doctors were unable to revive her.

The plight of the 16-year-old girl has sparked a national debate over abortion in the Dominican Republic, with some lawmakers calling on officials to reconsider the abortion ban.

Leaders of the liberal opposition took up the girl’s cause, calling on the government to reconsider the nation’s stringent anti-abortion stance, and even Dominican Minister of Health Bautista Rojas Gomez said he favored chemotherapy over protecting the girl's pregnancy.

However, Pelegriin Castillo, one of the sponsors of the Article 37, said the ban does not bar doctors from administering the treatment to treat cancer, but rather prevents them from using chemotherapy specifically to induce an abortion.

However, the teen’s doctors were allegedly hesitant to start treatment for fear of facing persecution if the chemotherapy were to end the pregnancy.

Reuters reported that Amnesty International has found that that in countries where abortion is totally banned, the rates of maternal mortality rise because doctors are unable to provide life-saving treatment that endangers pregnancy even when such treatment is necessary to save the mother's life.
