An ex-con was arrested after trying to rob three banks in one afternoon while using a taxi as a getaway car.

Luke Radick, 26, of Howell, NJ, is accused of hiring a cab Thursday to be his driver to three separate banks in the northern Philadelphia suburbs. He skipped the fare and was arrested a short time later after cops recognized his face from an earlier arrest.

Calling ‘the system broken’ the accused serial bank robber told local media he did it because he ‘needed the money. Why the (expletive) do you think I did it?’ on his way into an arraignment hearing.

Just released from jail only days earlier after serving four years in federal prison for a previous robbery attempt, Mr Radick decided to give his old trade another go.

Starting with a Sovereign Bank in Bensalem, PA at 12:15pm, Mr Radick then moved to another Sovereign Bank in nearby Yardsley before deciding not to push his luck any farther after robbing a Wells Fargo Bank in Morrisville around 1:45pm, according to Bensalem Patch.

Still fresh from prison, Mr Radick is said to have even written the note he handed tellers on the back of his bail release form, authorities told local media.

Coming to grips with what he was a part of, the cab driver booted Mr Radick from the cab, the miscreant fled without paying the fare, according to reports.

‘Certainly we’re not charging the cabby, but he finally woke up and realized this guy was out robbing banks,’ Bensalem Police spokesperson Fred Harran told KYW.

The felon allegedly only collected money from the second bank he robbed, a grand total of $125, according to WPVI. The teller in the first bank ran away after Mr Radick handed her the note, causing him to flee, KYW reported. The teller at the third bank  

The teller at the third bank also fled, according to NBC Philadelphia, causing Mr Radick to run out empty-handed.

Mr. Radick was arrested just before 4pm after police recognized him from an arrest only a week earlier.

‘[An officer] spotted him and Bensalem officers were right behind him. We picked this guy up on Aug. 24, for allegedly doing drugs in a car,” Morrisville Police Lieutenant Tom Herron told PhillyBurbs.com.

When asked if he was sorry for his crime spree on his way into his arraignment hearing, Mr Radick replied ‘I’m not sorry I did it, I’m sorry I got caught.’

The earlier bank robbery that landed Mr Radick in jail ended even worse. After walking into a Stroudsburg, PA bank armed with a shotgun and handing a teller a note, the bank's double security doors trapped him harmlessly in the vestibule until cops arrived. His four-year sentence came after pleading guilty to a single count of attempted robbery, PhillyBurbs.com reported.

This time he is charged with one count of robbery, two counts of attempted robbery and three counts of making terroristic threats.
