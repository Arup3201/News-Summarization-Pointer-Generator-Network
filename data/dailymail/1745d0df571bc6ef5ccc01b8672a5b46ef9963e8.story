A mother was ordered not to breastfeed her baby in public because she was in a ‘multicultural building’.

Emma Mitchell, 32, was about to feed 19-week-old son Aaron when a receptionist at a town hall warned her to stop.

Last night Mrs Mitchell condemned council staff, saying it was time people recognised the law which allows nursing mothers to breastfeed in public.

Carer Emma Mitchell was told she couldn't breast-feed her five-month-old son Aaron

‘It was just awful. I felt  humiliated, intimidated and guilty through the whole thing,’ she said.

‘What I was doing was one of the most
 natural things a mother can do. You hear everywhere  that breast is 
best for your baby, so why wouldn’t I be allowed to do that?’

The incident occurred when Mrs Mitchell, from Oldham, was in the Citizens’ Advice Bureau in Oldham Civic Centre.

The mother of two was asking  about hiring a babysitter for her two boys when Aaron became hungry and started crying.

She then asked the receptionist if 
she could use a corner of  the room to feed him, but she refused, saying
 it was a ‘multicultural building’.

Mrs Mitchell, who is married to Neil,
 43, a lorry driver, said: ‘She then rang the manager who told me that I
 couldn’t breastfeed here and to go into the shopping centre’s public 
toilets instead.

Ms Mitchell was visiting the Citizens' Advice Bureau at Oldham council

‘A member of the complaints department came down and spoke to the receptionist.

‘But she then told me that I had caused an uproar. I just asked to be allowed a place to feed my crying baby.’

Michelle Booth, 38, a friend who was 
at the civic centre, said: ‘I don’t understand. It’s political 
correctness gone mad when they’re worried about offending people of 
other cultures over something so natural.’

Under UK law, mothers can breastfeed 
in public under the provision  of goods, services and facilities  
section of the Sexual Discrimination Act, whatever the age of the baby, 
 in places such as council buildings, cafes, restaurants, libraries and 
 doctors’ surgeries.

Last night councillor Shoab Akhtar, 
of Oldham Council, said: ‘We fully support the right of mothers to 
breastfeed their children and actively encourage it due to the long-term
 health benefits it provides.

‘Mrs Mitchell’s disappointing 
experience has highlighted the need to make all our staff fully aware of
 our policy and our legal requirements.

‘Staff will be trained in the coming 
days to ensure this never happens again, and we will be contacting Mrs 
Mitchell to apologise.

‘Staff should make every reasonable 
effort to assist a mother’s need to breastfeed, whether she requests the
 use of a private room or otherwise.’

Council says it has no obligation to provide facilities but then makes embarrassing U-turn
