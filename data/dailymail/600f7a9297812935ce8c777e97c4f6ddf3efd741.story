Relaxing on a beach with an ice lolly on a hot day is a summertime treat people of all ages enjoy.

But now two entrepreneurs have started selling lollies strictly for grown-ups – because they’re laced with alcohol.

University graduates Harry Stimpson and Noah Greeves, both 23, showcased their cocktail-flavoured lollies – available in Pina Colada or Mojito varieties – in Brighton yesterday.

Beach booze: Love Iced Cocktails launched yesterday in Brighton, offering Pina Colada and Mojito flavours

The pair, who have been best friends since their schooldays, launched their business Love Iced Cocktails last year.

After scooping a £25,000 prize in an enterprise competition and winning grants from organisations including the Prince’s Trust, they are launching their cocktail-flavoured ice lollies, called Mahiki LIC, this summer.

The idea for the business came from Harry’s mother, Maureen, who fancied a frozen Pina Colada as she sunbathed on the beach in Miami.

Each lolly, created by a university graduate duo, contains the equivalent alcohol content to a glass of wine

Their formula, developed with professors at Nottingham University, allows the freezing of alcohol at 15 per cent ABV (alcohol by volume), with each lolly the equivalent of drinking one glass of wine.

But last night the chief executive of the British Liver Trust, Andrew Langford, warned: ‘They must be very clearly labelled. 

‘What we don’t want is for children to have yet another opportunity to consume alcohol.’
