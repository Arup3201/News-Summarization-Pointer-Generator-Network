A man whose video of himself being chased by police to test if they were 'fit and healthy' went viral is being threatened with court for wasting police time.

Sylwester Wardega, 26, from Warsaw, Poland, clocked up over 4.5 million YouTube hits for his video Police Trainer which shows him approaching police officers while pretending to drink beer and then running off when they ask for his ID.

At the beginning of the video he says: 'The security of people is very important to me.

Joker: Sylwester Wardega (centre) made a YouTube video of him pretending to drink beer in front of police then running off to get them to chase him

Irritating: The 26-year-old said he wanted to test whether the officers were 'fit and healthy'

Viral: The video called Police Trainer has clocked up over 4.5 million hits on YouTube

Not taking the bait: In most cases, the officers simply watch as he runs off into the distance

'Police officers in order to successfully catch criminals need to be fit and in good physical condition.

'That’s why as a concerned citizen I have been encouraging officers to run frequently.'

He
 fills a beer bottle with apple juice to make it look like he is breaking the law as drinking is prohibited in public places in Warsaw.

He then proceeds to be chased on 
various occasions, although in most cases the officers simply watched as
 he ran off into the distance.

On
 only a few occasions was he caught, but then released. Now police have 
threatened to take him to court for wasting their time.

Drastic measures: Mr Wardega even climbs a tree to get them to follow him

Not so funny now: Police are now threatening to take him to court for wasting their time

Snared: On only a few occasions was he caught, but then released without charge

Speaking to local media, Wardega said: 'The police have told me they may be taking me to court.

'Officially this is because in the last scene of the video they catch me but couldn’t charge me with anything because I hadn’t broken any laws.

'So now they say I was wasting their time.'

A police spokesman confirmed they were looking into the matter.

Making a point: At the beginning, he fills a beer bottle with apple juice to make it look like he is breaking the law
