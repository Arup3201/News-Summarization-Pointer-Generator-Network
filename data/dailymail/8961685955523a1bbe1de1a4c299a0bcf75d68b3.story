A Colorado community shaken by the loss of their beloved elk held a walk to honor the creature while accusing the local police department of cruelly misusing their authority.

Several dozen residents of Boulder marched in a silent protest on Sunday, some blaring elk calls on their outstretched cell phones.

The elk, who's affectionately known as 'Big Boy,' was shot dead by police officer Brent Curnow, who was later revealed to be the operator of a taxidermy website.

Probe: Boulder police officer Brent Curnow allegedly shot the elk and didn't report the killing while on-duty; he is now under investigation by the Colorado Parks & Wildlife department

Big Boy's death fueled massive public outcry after the officer claimed the elk was injured and he shot it to put the animal out of its misery, a claim neighbors in the Mapleton Hill area deny.

'We're concerned about the larger culture of misconduct that needs to be addressed in order for taxpaying voters to regain trust in the department,' a resident involved in the walk told CBS Denver.

The officers were later identified as Curnow and Sam Carter, who have been suspended pending the results of an internal probe.

On January 4, Boulder Police Chief Mark Beckner tweeted: 'Two officers involved in Elk shooting incident have been placed on Admin Leave w/pay pending the outcome of investigations.'

Vigil: Hundreds of Boulder residents gathered last Sunday for a vigil to remember Big Boy

Guardian: The elk had been seen around the community for several days before he was shot

CBS Denver reported that the district attorney is preparing to file charges against the police officer who shot the famous elk.

The walk was the latest in a series of events for Big Boy. Last week, the community held a candlelight vigil in his honor.

The massive creature was described as their 'guardian' by some.

Curnow has been with the department for 14 years, according to the Boulder Daily Camera.

The officer, who is facing a criminal investigation by Colorado Parks and Wildlife, failed to report the kill. The Daily Camera revealed that Curnow also owns a taxidermy website.

Spirit: Many admired the elk for its grace

The Estes Gazette reports that Curnow initially reported that he killed the creature because it was injured, not aggressive.

His taxidermy website advertises 'quality taxidermy at an affordable price,' according to the paper.

It is believed that Curnow and Carter were going to cut up the animal for its meat.

There were mixed reports from Boulder residents that the bull elk had been behaving aggressively.
