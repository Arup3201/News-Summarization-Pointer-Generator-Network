Millions of Indonesians have watched on television exactly how Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan will be executed on 'Death Island'.

Chilling video has emerged of the mobile paramilitary brigade called Brimob in firing practice ahead of the last round of executions on Nusa Kambangan, where Chan and Sukumaran are due to be shifted 72 hours ahead of their deaths by firing squad.

This comes as coffins arrived at a Christian Church in Cilacap, the nearest port to Nusa Kambangan, where a local Indonesian caretaker was pictured preparing four caskets in preparation for the executions.

Hooded figure: Indonesia's Channel 1 recreated the method of execution by firing squad which was used to kill six foreigners on Nusa Kambangan last month using the hooded figure (pictured) to represent the prisoner. It is the same method that will be used on Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran

Target practice: These members of the Brimob paramilitary group practice firing at targets ahead of last months execution on 'Death Island'. The same group will carry out the executions of Chan and Sukumaran

Bali Police Chief A.J. Benny Mokalu on Wednesday confirmed the procedures that will lead to the executions.

The condemned Australian pair would be taken from Bali's Kerobokan prison to Ngurah Rai airport during the night and flown 900 kilometres west to Cilacap, in central Java, then transferred by boat to Nusa Kambangan.

Exactly when this will take place is still unknown. Indonesian officials have repeatedly rejected appeals from the condemned men's lawyers and the Australian government to stay the executions of Chan and Sukumaran, who were convicted on heroin trafficking charges in 2006. 

The footage of the execution practice round was aired on television on January 17 to demonstrate to Indonesian viewers just what would take place when five foreign drug traffickers were executed the following day. 

Those executions, of nationals from Brazill, the Netherlands, Malawi, Vietnam and one Indonesian, were the first since President Joko Widodo came to power last October.

A tough stance on drug criminals was part of his campaign, and he has been uncompromising about using the death penalty despite pleas from foreign governments and rights activists.

The video shows  the Brimob executioners dressed in military fatigues with semi-automatic rifles aiming loud volleys of fire repeatedly at bullseye targets.

Even more horrifying is the spooky step-by-step recreation by Channel 1 Indonesia of the execution, using a white figure with its arms tied behind the back and a black hood over its head to represent the condemned man.

Death men: This eerie recreation of how the firing squad, which Channel 1 Indonesia represented with nine scary looking robotic figures, lines up to carry out the execution 

The wives of convicted Indonesian terrorists imprisoned on the island where Australians Chan and Sukumaran are due to be executed visited their husbands the facility this week 

The mobile paramilitary brigade, Brimob, who will execute the two Australians is pictured in firing practice last month before they executed five foreign drug traffickers on Nusa Kambangan Island

In the recreation, the firing squad is represented by a row of toy or robotic looking figures. The television report also lists a 27 point manifesto about how the execution will proceed, including the execution 'commander' raising a sword 'as a symbol for the firing squad to aim at the heart of the convict'.

Points 24 and 25 give specific instructions for doctors to check the condition of the convict immediately after the shooting, 'and if the doctor thinks that the convict is still showing signs of life ... the firing squad commander must put a pistol to the temple just above the ear of the convict' and finish the job.

Some of the last words the men being executed will hear are 'laksanakan, laksanakan' - meaning 'execute, execute' in Indonesian - shouted by the firing squad commander before three live rounds and nine blanks are loaded into the twelve rifles of the firing squad shooters.

Part of the process includes clergy attending to 'give offenders a last chance to calm down for a maximum of three minutes' before they are shot.

At at Wijaya Pura port in Cilacap, there are currently no signs of the horror awaiting the two Australians or the seven other people who may also be executed at the same time - four from Indonesia and one each from Brazil, Ghana and Nigeria.

The topical island appeared idyllic on Wednesday, and children jumped in and out of the calm waters of the port.

Indonesian residents, living on the mainland across from the island (pictured in the background), reported hearing volleys of rifles shots as the firing squad performed practice drills in preparation for the execution

But the scene at Wijaya Pura port in Cilacap, where the island serves only as a seemingly peaceful backdrop, showed no signs of the horror waiting to unfold as children jumped in and out of the calm waters
