A woman accused of leaving her newborn baby to die in a trash can near Salt Lake City is not mentally competent to stand trial, a Utah judge ruled today.

Court-ordered evaluations found that Alicia Englert, 23, is mentally disabled and has an IQ too low for her to legally stand trial on a felony attempted murder charge, lawyer Josie Brumfield said.

Utah law says a defendant must have an IQ of 70 to face trial. In a Wechsler IQ Test, an 'average classification' score is between 90 and 109.

Court-ordered evaluations found that Alicia Englert, 23,  is mentally disabled and has an IQ too low for her to legally stand trial on a felony attempted murder charge for allegedly leaving her newborn baby to die in a trash can near Salt Lake City

Judge Elizabeth Hruby-Mills said Englert will enter treatment. The judge set a new hearing date for June 8 to re-assess whether she's become competent for trial

Judge Elizabeth Hruby-Mills said Englert will enter treatment. The judge set a new hearing date for June 8 to re-assess whether she's become competent for trial.

Englert had a difficult childhood, Brumfield said. Her mother went to prison when she was about 18 months old, and though she was able to finish high school, a single in-depth conversation shows she didn't function at typical adult level.

'She kind of got lost in the cracks, really didn't get any help or treatment,' Brumfield said.

An attorney for Englert's parents called for the charge to be dismissed. 'She doesn't understand the gravity of what took place, and the finding of incompetency confirms that,' Jessica Peterson said.

Alicia Englert has not entered a plea. She appeared in court with her parents wearing a black jacket and green blouse, and did not take questions from reporters. 

She remained free on bail after Monday's hearing, and state authorities will evaluate Englert to decide what form her treatment will take, Brumfield said.

Court documents say Englert gave birth in a bathroom at her home in the Salt Lake City suburb of Kearns and left the baby girl without food or medical care for a day before wrapping her in a towel and abandoning her in the trash on August 26 

Prosecutors say the infant would have died if she had not been found by a neighbor who thought she heard a cat purring in the garbage. She was suffering from hypothermia, respiratory distress and a blood-borne infection when she was found

Her father, Robert Englert said at the time of the incident that his daughter had a learning disability and didn't understand the pregnancy or the implications of abandoning the baby

Prosecutors will take another look at the case to decide what happens next, Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said.

In some cases, defendants are able to face charges after treatment, but sometimes the setback for prosecutors is permanent, he said.

Englert's daughter was taken into custody and has recovered from the horrifying incident. She is now five months old and being adopted

She was suffering from hypothermia, respiratory distress and a blood-borne infection when she was found.

Englert's father, Robert said at the time that his daughter had a learning disability and didn't understand the pregnancy or the implications of abandoning the baby.

Her baby was flown to a hospital and placed on a ventilator, but she recovered and is being adopted.

Judge Hruby-Mills granted a supervised 90-minute goodbye visit for Englert and her family in December, a fairly common allowance for parents whose rights are terminated after their children are taken into state custody.

Fox13 previously published a photo album of Englert allegedly drinking alcohol, dancing and clubbing - 'potentially within the same window of time that she was pregnant,' the station said.

Investigators don't believe other family members knew about the baby being in the house, Salt Lake County Attorney Sim Gill said.

But Robert Englert, said in September that his daughter had only just started to realize what she had done.

'She doesn't even realize that it's a crime and it's bad,' Englert told The Salt Lake Tribune. 'Even when the police were taking her to jail, she thought they were taking her to her room.'
