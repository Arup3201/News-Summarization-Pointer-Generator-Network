Bing Crosby's dreams look set to come true this year as forecasters predict a white Christmas across the UK.

The heavy winds, rain and flooding which have battered the nation in recent weeks are set to continue right up to December 25.

But on Christmas Eve, temperatures will plummet, leaving some parts of the country covered in snow by morning - albeit a light dusting.

According to the Met Office, heavy rain will pass late on Christmas Eve to make way for snowfall across the UK

Parts of the UK, including the Yorkshire Dales, already have a light coating of snow that will thicken

Eddy Carroll, chief forecaster with the Met Office, said: 'We can expect stormy weather in many areas to start the Christmas week, but looking forward to Christmas Eve and Christmas Day we are expecting it to turn colder, with a mix of wintry showers and sunny spells but for wind speeds to drop.

'So there is a chance that some places may see a White Christmas.'

Officially, a white Christmas is defined as just one single snowflake falling from the sky.

But those hoping to bring the sledge down from the loft or dress a snowman with scarf and hat might be a little disappointed - unless you live in the mountains of Scotland.

'It's not going to be cold enough for 
widespread snow, it's more of a showery picture,' said Chris Burton, 
from weather forecasters MeteoGroup.

'There
 will be a bit of sleet and snow on the higher ground, such as the hills
 of Wales and in northern England, and wintry showers will be heavy in 
the mountains of Scotland.

Rain: Extreme weather conditions have battered the UK for days, filling rivers and streams, like this one in Wiltshire, to the brim. Rain is set to continue right up until December 25

'But it's probably not going to be a white Christmas in central London.'

Widespread covering of snow on the ground - where more than 40 per cent 
of Britain's stations reported snow on the ground at 9am - has happened 
just four times in the last 52 years.

Christmas 2010 was the last white Christmas. With a thick layer of snow coating the nation, it was extremely unusual.

Snow
 on the ground was recorded at 83 per cent of stations, the highest ever
 recorded, and snow or sleet also fell at 19 per cent of stations.

While most dream of gardens blanketed with crisp, white snow, the Met Office says the definition is of a single snowflake falling in the 24 hours of December 25.

But we are often left disappointed as climate history shows wintry weather is more likely between January and March.

Snow or sleet falls on average five days in December, compared to 7.6 days in January, 6.8 days in February and six days in March.

But we can remain optimistic as at least one snowflake has fallen on 38 Christmases in the last 52 years.

Snow lying on the ground on Christmas Day is much rarer.

White Christmases were more frequent in the 18th and 19th centuries, according to the Met Office.

The change of calendar in 1752, which effectively brought Christmas Day back by 12 days, also minimised the chances.

Climate change has also brought higher average temperatures over land and sea, which generally reduces the probability of a white Christmas.

But experts claim that will not make them less likely in the future.

There
 was also a white Christmas in 2009, when 13 per cent of stations 
recorded snow or sleet falling, and 57 per cent reported snow on the 
ground.

Until then, the weather is set to be blustery and extreme across the nation.

Much
 of the weekend will be cool and showery, the Met Office said, with low 
pressure developing over the Atlantic on Sunday and passing to the north
 west of the UK on Monday and into Tuesday.

That
 low pressure will bring widespread strong winds and heavy rain from 
Monday morning for 24 hours, and the Met Office has issued severe 
weather warnings for wind and rain across the South West and northern 
areas of the UK for the next few days, bringing the possibility of 
flooding.

Travellers 
expected to crowd on to trains, boats and planes over Christmas have 
been warned to take care as Britain enters some of the busiest days of 
the year for the transport system.

Those hoping for an easy ride could find the journey hampered by a stormy few days.

Parts of western Scotland could see up to 20in of rain, and 10 to 15in the south-west of England as the unsettled outlook continues.

The rest of the UK will also see much the same which has led to a series of weather warnings being put in place for later with gale force winds and more heavy rain forecast.

Met Office forecaster Dan Williams warned that anyone using the roads for their Christmas getaways should be careful.

He said: 'Driving conditions won't be good, there will be strong winds across the country today and rain. We would advise people to allow extra time for their journeys and drive to the conditions.'

A spokesman for the Environment Agency said: 'People who are set to be away from home for the festive period are urged to check the flood situation and take precautionary steps to prepare, for example by moving valuable items to safety, before travelling.

'People are also urged to check the flood risk situation for their journey and at their destination.

'People are also being urged not to drive through dangerous flood water. The Environment Agency has teams on the ground checking flood defences and monitoring river levels and will have teams ready to respond throughout the Christmas period.'

Travellers are warned to take care when driving over the Christmas period as temperatures plummet

A white Christmas is technically when one snowflake falls, which has happened 38 Christmases in the last 52 years. Widespread snow has only occurred four times in the same time period

John McTaggart, head of on-road services at the Highways Agency, said: 'We are working closely with the Met Office to monitor conditions ahead of the weather being forecast for next week.

'Road users are urged to check traffic and weather conditions before setting out on journeys and to heed any advice such as speed restrictions once they are on motorways and major trunk roads.

'We aware of sudden gusts of wind, and give high-sided vehicles, caravans, motorbikes and bicycles plenty of space. In the event of persistent high winds we may need to close certain bridges to traffic for a period, so please be alert for warnings of closures and follow signposted diversion routes.'
