Earlier this month the ex-basketball player had been charged with unlawful possession of a short-barreled shotgun, The Seattle Times reported.

Citing court records, the charge stemmed from a raid on a home that Swift and Trugve 'Trigg Bjorstam' inhabited, the newspaper reported.

54-year-old Bjorkstam has been charged with drug offenses, The Seattle Times found.

The newspaper - citing charging papers - reported Swift possessed multiple guns and took heroin each day when the arrest took place.

Redmond police investigated for two months leading up to Swift's and Bjorkstam's October 4 arrests, according to the news outlet.

Swift was allegedly the owner of multiple guns and a daily heroin user at the time of his October 2014 arrest

Prosecutor Dan Satterberg's spokesman Dan Donohoe told The Seattle Times that Swift had been told to attend the arraigment before being booked and having $20,000 bail set.

Satterberg said the bench warrant was set for $20,000 by the judge after Swift did not turn up.

The Seattle Times noted that Swift only played in 97 NBA games, after he was the 2004 NBA draft's 12th overall pick, and he stopped playing with Tokyo Apache after an earthquake and a tsunami struck took place in 2011.
