Footballer John Terry has bought the £4.35million former mansion of golfer Colin Montgomerie, downsizing from the £16million home which he sold earlier this year.

The £170,000-a-week Chelsea captain has bought the seven-bedroom property, which is nestled in a half-acre estate in Oxshott, Surrey, after selling his nine-bedroom mansion, situated just a few hundred yards away.

He made a £10million profit by selling his luxury home to General Sultan bin Mohammed al-Naamani, a senior minister for the Arab state - who reportedly purchased it for his boss Sultan Qaboos bin Said in January.

Terry, 33, had planned to move into the brand new white mansion, which he built next door to his old property – a red-brick house which he sold last year for £5.25million after three years on the market.

However, he received an out-of-the-blue £16million offer for his new home from Mr al-Naamani, who is believed to have bought the home for his wealthy boss - Sultan Qaboos bin Said, 72 - who has an estimated fortune of £650million.

Terry, together with his wife Toni and twin children, then had to move into rented accommodation while searching for a new home - which he has now bought from the world-famous golfer.

The property, which boasts seven bedrooms, six bathrooms, four reception rooms, and a two-bedroom staff annex, is just a few hundred yards from Terry's former properties.

However, it is considerably smaller than his former homes, which are all located just a short drive from Chelsea's training ground in Cobham.

A source told The Sun: 'It's a lovely house but a considerable downsize. Obviously he has invested his huge profits from the last place elsewhere or they are sitting in the bank.'

It is understood Terry has carried out an extensive  refurbishment of his new property, estimated to be in the region of £1.5million, which saw high-spec renovations to the interior, exterior and garden.

The property was owned by Montgomerie a few years ago and he is thought to have used it as a place to stay while he had a neighbouring house renovated. 

The Scottish golfer bought a house in a nearby road and had it razed to the ground before building a multi-million mansion in its place. He stayed in the property now owned by Terry while the works were being carried out. 

It is thought Terry looked at several houses in the area before his purchase, including Montgomerie's new mansion which has an estimated value of £18million. 

Terry's new property boasts seven bedrooms, six bathrooms, four reception rooms and a grand stairway. These photographs show its interior before it underwent an extensive top-to-bottom refurbishment by Terry

The Oxshott mansion is nestled in the wealthy suburb and boasts a large garden and beautiful views. Terry is thought to have had the interior, exterior and gardens completely renovated to a cost of in the region of £1.5m

Terry - who is estimated to be worth £29million - received a total of £21.25million after selling his two neighbouring houses, including one which was to be his dream home.

The footballer bought his first home in Oxshott for £2.25million in 2003 and reportedly had to re-mortgage four times.

A few years later it went on the market and, after receiving no offers, the former England captain was advised to drop the asking price by £750,000 in 2010.

However, helped by the burgeoning property market, he was finally able to sell it for more than the £5million asking price, helping him finance his second mansion.

The second property, built next door to his former home in 2007 for £1.8million, had a further £4million spent on renovating it, with a fishing lake even being built in the back garden.

Terry's former homes were situated adjacent to each other (centre) after he chose to build a custom-made nine-bedroom mansion next to his original red-brick house in Oxshott, Surrey. He later sold both of them

Terry was reported to have incurred a mortgage debt of £4.6million on the building of the new house.

Construction work started in December 2011 and the finished mansion was believed to include a 33 x 40ft indoor swimming pool, complete with a jacuzzi, steam room and changing facilities.

It also reportedly had nine bedrooms, eight bathrooms and a cinema, as well as staff accommodations and a visitor annexe in a separate wing.

Following the sale to Mr al-Naamani in January, it was reported that the Omani royal family wanted the house 'at any cost' and made Terry 'an offer he couldn't refuse'.

Representatives of John Terry declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.
