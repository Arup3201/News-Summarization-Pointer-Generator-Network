The world’s fastest fiddler can add another string to his bow - he’s been declared the quickest human on the planet.

Talented violinist and four-times world speed-violin record holder Ben Lee was awarded the title of World’s Fastest Superhuman for his rendition of The Flight of the Bumblebee, at an average of 15 notes per second.

Judges and scientists for the Quest programme Superhuman Showdown unanimously voted the 32-year-old musician the fastest superhuman on earth, beating off competition from a speed shooter and a base jumper.

Mr Lee, from Eastbourne in Sussex, said: 'I set new records not only in electric violin, but in classical as well and from there I took the next challenge - to appear on Superhuman Showdown beating some incredible competition.

'It’s taken tens of thousands of hours of practice to reach this speed but it definitely helped that my parents were musical and encouraged me to play.'

Mr Lee was tested for speed against world base race champion Frode Johannessen, who can ‘fly’ unassisted at 170pm and speed shooter Jerry Miculek who can fire eight rounds on four targets in 1.06 seconds.

He was also up against head spinner Aicho Ono, who can perform 135 head spins in one minute without experiencing dizziness, and speed eater Pete Czerwinski, who can eat a 12 inch pizza in 34 seconds.

They were measured for speed in a controlled environment by scientists including former Olympic pentathlete Professor Greg Whyte from the Research Institute for Sport and Exercise Science at Liverpool John Moores University.

The result was announced researchers used magnetic electrical pulses to measure brain activity during the tasks.

Ben has played the violin since the age of five. At 16 he was awarded Daily Telegraph Young Jazz Composer Of The Year.

He is one half of rock violin duo Fuse and was the first person to hold the Guinness World Records for the Fastest Violinist In The World in both the electric and acoustic categories.

'I’ve been challenging myself to play as fast as I can since I was five years old,' said Mr Lee, who insured his lightening quick fingers for £3million last year.

'It wasn’t until I had a serious bike accident and nearly lost the ability to play that Linzi Stoppard, my music partner, challenged me to enter the Guinness World Records as the world’s fastest violinist.

'Meeting Linzi, who changed my image, got me physically fit and turned my life around so I’d have the same professional stage presence as she did helped my stamina and my focus.

'I believe that all of this combined to help me win the Superhuman title and set new world records which I plan to hold onto. I can only get faster from here.'

Each contestant on Superhuman Showdown was specially selected from hundreds of fast performing humans around the world.

Professor Whyte said: 'Through dedicated and long term practice, Ben is able to devote larger portions of his brain to a task.

'Ben bows with his right hand, which means that his left cortex should utilised more than his right.

'However, with the focus and control he uses with his left hand, Ben has developed a greater proportion of his right cortex, giving him powerful dexterity and the ability to play at 810 notes per minute.'

It is because of this that Mr Lee has become the first person to break the ‘magic minute’ barrier, which most professionals said could not be done.

His record for playing Flight of the Bumblebee note perfect on the electric violin is 58.05 seconds.
