Cincinnati Bengals defensive tackle Devon Still and his four-year-old daughter are releasing a children's book to inspire children who are battling cancer.

Four-year-old Leah Still, who was diagnosed with pediatric neuroblastoma in June, wrote the book with her father after many sought the football player's advice in dealing with his daughter's difficult diagnosis, USA Today reports. 

The book is called 'I am Leah Strong,' and Still, 25, said the entire book was written by the youngster.

'That book was written by her,' Still told USA Today. 'I just had an outline of questions I wanted to ask her. Whatever answers she had I wrote in book form.' 

The book will be released in February and is currently available for pre-order on the book's website. 

Leah's battle with the disease gained national attention in 2014 when the Bengals cut Still from the roster, only to sign him again once they learned of Leah's illness.
