Experience counts for a lot: Don't be rookie; use these experts tips to help you have a hassle-free trip abroad 

DELETE COOKIES

This is a sure-fire way to ensure you get your flight for less. João Leitão from adventure travel blog Nomad Revelations says: 'Airline websites keep track of your cookies and they  increase the price of tickets to rush you into buying if they see you keep looking at the same page. 

'Every time you actually search for a plane ticket, either go incognito - by using a new computer - or just clean your cookies browser options each time.' 

TRAVEL BY LAND  

Flying may be speedy but you miss out on a lot along the way. Robert Schrader, the creator of travel website Leave Your Daily Hell says: 'Not only does travelling by land allow you to experience a destination better than flying, but it's cheaper and more flexible (you can often buy train and bus tickets last-minute, with little or no close-in booking penalty), allowing you to adjust your travel based on what you're feeling each day, as oppose to how you felt at your desk planning out every detail of the trip.

Trust locals: Pick a restaurant that is full to the brim with locals at dinner or lunch as it will be the best value

TRUST LOCALS 

You might think they are trying to get one over on you, but when it comes to food they know the best places to eat. 'While choosing a place to eat, always pick the restaurant with the most local customers inside. These places will serve the freshest, best value food,' says João Leitão.

LEAVE GUIDE BOOKS AT HOME

They weigh down your hand luggage and take up space in your suitcase. 'Rather than taking your entire copy of the Rough Guide or Lonely Planet, just photocopy the pages you need, then discard after you have used them. Saves space and weight,' says James Teideman, Skyscanner Marketing Communications Executive.

CUT YOUR TOOTHBRUSH IN HALF

It's this kind of space saving initiative that will get you far while on the road. Save space and reduce weight by sawing your toothbrush in half. The extra three cubic centimetres in your hand luggage can be used to carry extra sheets of paper (see above tip),  toothpaste or toiletries. Bravo!

TRAVEL IN A HOODIE

Hoodies may be the uniform of ASBO holders, but they also make great travel garments. Hide your face when you need a snooze or turn it into a makeshift pillow. 'Just slip up your hood to retreat from the world of noise and light when you want to sleep on a flight, airport seat or bus,' says Sam Baldwin, Skyscanner Travel Editor.

PACK HALF OF WHAT YOU WANT 

Paul Johnson, a member of the Professional Travel Bloggers Association and who started A Luxury Travel blog, one of the most popular travel blogs in the world, has  simple (if brutal) packing advice. 

'Lay out your clothes and any other belongings you wish to take with you, and pack only half. It’s always so much easier to travel light.' Others suggest constraining yourself to 10kg of luggage, no matter where you are going.

CHOOSE YOUR SEAT ON EACH FLIGHT 

No matter how long or short your flight, Paul Johnson says you should always check in early and pick the right seat. 'Some people will want the leg room, others the window seat, others an aisle and some will want to be either near to, or away from, the lavatory,' he says.

'Your best bet to make a proper evaluation would be to look at online resources such as SeatGuru.com and SeatExpert.com, or Skytrax’s own airplane seat guides and maps.'

PICK ASIAN OR VEGETARIAN OPTIONS ON FLIGHTS

Food cannot be cooked on board a flight so everything must come pre-cooked ready to be heated up. For this reason vegetables or Asian food is a safer option. 

'You get fed before anyone else, you avoid anything too greasy and stodgy (it helps the jet lag, allegedly) and I’m convinced the more niche meals are much better quality as they’re made in smaller batches,' warns Victoria Baillie, Skyscanner PR Manager.

GET LOUNGE ACCESS

According to Paul Johnson: 'Even if you’re not travelling business or first class, there are many ways to gain access to the airport lounges and start your journey in a little more comfort, away from the hustle and bustle of the main terminal thoroughfare.'

'This can be achieved by being a frequent flyer, by signing up for lounge access for the year, purchasing a lounge pass, or – in some cases – by being a premium credit card customer.' Research before you leave the house for stress-free terminal time.

MOVE SLOWLY 

Paul's last tip is invaluable.  'Too many people try to 'tick off' as many sights, cities and countries as they can.

'Take more time to do less and you'll get a better chance to truly appreciate and get to know a destination. It's a much more relaxing and enjoying way to travel, too. 

'What's more, you'll also have plenty of excuses to return to explore other destinations on your next visit.'
