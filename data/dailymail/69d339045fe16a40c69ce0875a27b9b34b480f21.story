An Ohio man has been charged with murder after a baby boy was hit with a coffee mug thrown during an argument between his parents and died.

Anthony Benjamin Grove, 33, was arrested on Tuesday after the two-month old baby died of serious head injuries at Akron Children's Hospital, in Akron, Ohio.

Investigators in Canton said the baby was hit in the head by the mug and hospital workers subsequently notified police.

Police say Grove has also been charged with child endangering and domestic violence.

He is currently being kept in Stark County Jail.

Police said Grove is accused of throwing the ceramic coffee mug at his wife during an argument but accidentally hit his baby son Zeeland Grove instead.

Anthony Grove also was arrested on a warrant for failing to appear in an unrelated theft case, authorities said.

Baby Zeeland died at 11.30 am on Tuesday morning. 

Authorities say they are holding Grove on a $2 million bail after prosecutors charged him with murder, child endangering and domestic violence, reported Daily News.

Neighbors say Grove often fought with his girlfriend.

'It makes me feel so sad. A freak accident. They shouldn't have been fighting. It's just wild. Just sad,' said neighbor Dorothea Stoudemire told 19 Action News.

Resident Edwin Davies told the television station: 'He left my house, threw a beer can and I blocked it. 

'Then he went to his house and I guess he started arguing with his girl. 

'He loved that baby. He was crazy about that baby. I can promise you that.'
