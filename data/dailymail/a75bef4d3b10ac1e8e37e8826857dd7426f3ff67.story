Set against a stunning autumnal backdrop hundreds of foxhunters have taken to the saddle to ride out to the blaring sound of the horns, signalling the start of the hunting season.

Mounted high on their horses, foxhunters of all ages and dressed in smart hunting jackets, gathered as scores of British hunts gathered today.

Cutting a majestic sight through the countryside surrounding Headlam village in County Durham, the Zetland Hunt paraded through the rural lanes, drawing crowds to watch the spectacle.

Tally ho: Hundreds of foxhunters rode out for the start of the hunting season today. Hounds from the Zetland Hunt in North Yorkshire set off at dawn with huntsman David Jukes at the healm

Following tradition, Reverend Andy Pell blessed the hounds and the riders warmed themselves with glasses of port before setting off.

Moments later huntsman David Jukes sounded a horn to signal the start of the hunting season.

Meanwhile in Appleton Roebuck, North Yorkshire, the York and Ainsty South Hunt 
filled the roads around the village, with hoards
 of riders following the leaders clad in bright red jackets.

Despite the overcast weather the huntsmen and women of all ages relished the start of the new season.

Traditionally the hunting season starts at the beginning of November.

Many
 supporters of fox hunting are continuing to press for a repeal of the 
ban on hunting with dogs, in force since February 2005.

They say the current law is hard to interpret and enforce.

Tim Bonner, director of campaigns at the 
Countryside Alliance, told The Guardian: 'We are now going into the ninth hunting 
season under the Hunting Act â€“ an act that is not working for hunts, 
antis, the courts or the wildlife it claims to safeguard.'

But anti-hunting campaigners warned their team of investigators will be out in a bid to catch those flouting the law.

Joe Duckworth, chief executive of the League Against Cruel Sports, told the paper: 'Hunters found to be flouting the law need to watch out. Our team of 
investigators and the Hunting Act are here to stay.'

Between 2005 and 2011, a total of 332 individuals were prosecuted under the Hunting Act. Of these, 239 were found guilty.

Earlier this month Prime Minister David Cameron was reportedly said to be keen on relaxing hunting laws, showing sympathy to land owners who are losing stock to foxes.

A cross-party alliance of MPs suggested that the law banning farmers from using more than two dogs to flush out foxes and shoot them should be scrapped.

The Prime Minister said the House of Commons 'may wish to consider' a vote on the issue to make hunting with a full pack of dogs legal.

A Downing Street spokesman said: 'There is a very specific issue here around pest control and the impact it has on hill farmers.

'The Prime Minister has some sympathy with these concerns. Given the cross-party nature of concerns this is something which the house may wish to consider.'

However, Number 10 would not guarantee a free vote on repealing the ban during this Parliament.
