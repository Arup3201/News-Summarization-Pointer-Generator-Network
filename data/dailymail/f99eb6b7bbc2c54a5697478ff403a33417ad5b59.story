Marriya Wright, 34, stepped down from her position in Spokane County, Washington on Wednesday

A married deputy prosecutor has resigned from her job after she allegedly had an improper relationship with a jail inmate.

Marriya Wright, 34, stepped down from her position in Spokane County, Washington on Wednesday after court document released details of her alleged relationship with 31-year-old Matthew Baumrucker. 

The pair allegedly exchanged more than 1,200 text messages and phone calls in a month including one picture of Mrs Wright wearing a bikini. 

Baumrucker, who has 'criminal' tattooed on his forehead and words 'West Side' above his eyebrows, along with others, was facing drug and assault charges earlier this year. 

Under his eyes, he appears to have the word 'Hoover' and 'Crips' which could refer to a Washington gang '74 Hoover Crips'.

The relationship came to light in March after police sought out Baumrucker in connection with an assault. 

A witness later told police that Baumrucker called someone and said: 'Marriya, the police are chasing me...'

She apparently gave him advice on search warrants and went to meet him at a gas station - the incident which may have her facing charges of rendering criminal assistance, according to Oregon Live.

Mrs Wright had been on administrative leave since April while under suspicion of rendering criminal assistance. According to spokesman.com, she made $83,000 last year.

According to an online employment profile, Mrs Wright is married to Scott Wright, a Department of Corrections officer in Washington state. The couple recently adopted a child and are in the process of adopting a second. 

Her defense attorney Chris Bugbee told OregonLive that Mrs Wright overlooked Baumrucker's tattoos, was 'trying to save his soul' and bring him into the church.

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from Mr Bugbee today.  

Wright visited Baumrucker in jail several times in the attorney-client booth but she was not working on his cases. 

According to KREM, on one occasion, a jail officer spotted Baumrucker with a picture of Mrs Wright wearing a bikini. 

Baumrucker wrote to the TV station in August and said their relationship was 'above and beyond what anyone could have ever imagined'. 

State charges against Baumrucker were dropped on August 15 but he is still facing a federal charge of felon in possession of a firearm for allegedly having a semi-automatic gun. 

He remains in jail until his trial next month. 

The FBI is now investigating to see if Wright may have compromised any other investigations. No criminal charges have been filed against her.
