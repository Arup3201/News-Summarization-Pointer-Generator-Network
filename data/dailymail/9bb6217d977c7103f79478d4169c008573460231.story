When choosing your Christmas dinner playlist, select carefully - it could improve the taste of your food and drink. 

Eating a festive meal while listening to Elton John's Step Into Christmas will reduce the intensity of flavours, while the sultry tones of Eartha Kitt's Santa Baby improves them, according to a study. 

The world's largest multisensory tasting experiment found that a change in colour and sound can immediately affect the taste of wine by nearly ten per cent - and also changes how we taste food.

Listening to Elton John's Step into Christmas and Wham!'s Last Christmas will reduce the intensity of wine 

Everything from the colour of the tablecloth, and the scent of the candles to the songs playing in the background can significantly impact the taste of traditional Christmas dinner and drinks, says the research by Oxford University experimental psychologist Professor Charles Spence.

The professor analysed the nation's favourite Christmas tunes to find out which ones will most affect the taste buds – creating a perfect playlist to enhance this year's festive experience.

The traditional Christmas colours of red and green provided the perfect palette for the research and ten songs were divided into two categories to help identify key results.

The experiment showed that drinking red wine while listening to 'sweet' music - such as Kitt - under a red light was the preferred combination, increasing enjoyment of wine by as much as 10 per cent. 

Green light and 'sour music' - such as Elton's track or Wham!'s Last Christmas - increased freshness and reduced intensity of the wine by 14 per cent. 

Sweet music has a high pitch and a consonant harmony, while sour tunes and dissonant harmony.

Sweet Christmas Tunes to enhance the taste of wine

Celine Dion – The Christmas Song

Eartha Kitt – Santa Baby

Bing Crosby – White Christmas

Rod Stewart & Dave Koz – Let it Snow! Let it Snow! Let it Snow!

Dean Martin – Baby, It's Cold Outside

Sweet music is associated with music that has a high pitch, consonant harmony, legato articulation, and slow tempo. The piano is an instrument often associated with sweetness.

Sour Christmas Tunes to reduce the intensity of wine

Mariah Carey – All I Want For Christmas

Elton John – Step Into Christmas

Daryl Hall & John Oates – Jingle Bell Rock

Jackson 5 – Santa Claus is Coming to Town

Wham! – Last Christmas

People tend to associate sourness with music that has a high pitch, dissonant harmony, staccato articulation, and fast tempo. Brass instruments are often associated with sourness. 

Commenting on the findings, Professor Spence said: 'We knew that the results would have an impact on the environment created by restaurants, but it's now clear it can have a huge impact on the environment you create in your own home.

'This festive season applying the findings to your own dining table may well make the food and wine taste even better.'

The research also found that serving food in different coloured plates and settings would increase the enjoyment of the item. 

'Research has shown how everything from the glass we drink to the colour and shape of the plate we eat off can influence what we think about whatever we happen to be consuming,' he said. 

Guests  are more likely to enjoy sprouts served off a green plate because the visual cue counteracts the bitter flavour, the study found. 

And using a red tablecloth and serving a fruity red wine in red tinted wine glasses will enhance the sweet flavour profiles of cranberry sauce and pigs in blanket.  

People eat significantly more mince pies in an environment that looks, sounds and smells like Christmas, so pine needle and orange scented candles will help clear those plates.  

The research was commissioned by Spanish winemaker Campo Viejo and involved 3,000 people who took part in the brand's Streets of Spain festival.
