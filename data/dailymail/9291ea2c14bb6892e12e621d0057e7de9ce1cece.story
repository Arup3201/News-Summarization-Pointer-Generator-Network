A young woman and her boyfriend are pursuing legal action against Thomas Cook after they became severely ill during their stay at an Egyptian hotel.

Kayleigh Stannard, 26, and Luke Burns, 23, claim their ‘holiday from hell’ was caused by unsanitary conditions at the Stella Makadi Beach & Gardens Hotel in the resort of Makadi Bay last November.

The couple says they noticed insects around the eatery and birds inside the dining area, and chefs and kitchen staff were not wearing gloves when handling food.

'Holiday from hell': Kayleigh Stannard and Luke Burns say they became ill during their Egyptian getaway

They both fell ill midway through what was supposed to be a relaxing holiday in the sun, suffering from diarrhoea and severe abdominal pains.

Kayleigh developed a rash on her legs and was forced to take a week off work due to ongoing symptoms after she returned to her home in Horsforth, Leeds, West Yorkshire.

She visited her GP and was shocked when she was diagnosed with Trichostrongylus (round worms), a parasite that occurs through the ingestion of infected larvae.

The post office worker said: ‘It was such a shock to return home and hear that I had contracted a parasite. The illness ruined the holiday for me and my partner, Luke.’

She added: ‘The conditions in the hotel's 
dining area were worrying; we saw chefs handling food without wearing 
gloves quite a few times and on occasions there were insects and birds 
flying around where the food was being served and eaten.

‘This was supposed to be a dream holiday but it quickly turned into an absolute nightmare. It should have been a holiday to remember but is definitely something I'd rather forget.’

The couple have instructed travel lawyers from Irwin Mitchell to look into their case. 

Travel law expert Elizabeth Tetzner said Irwin Mitchell is investigating how the couple became ill and how Kayleigh became infected with the parasite.

She said: ‘The infection resulted in Kayleigh becoming extremely ill over a number of days and Luke suffered from similar symptoms - ruining their holiday and resulting in Kayleigh taking time off work for recovery when she returned back home.

"We hope that Thomas Cook will now work with us to provide Kayleigh and Luke with the answers they clearly need about these issues to allow them to move on and put the experience behind them.

‘Gastric illness can have a devastating, impact on people's health and the effects of it cannot be underestimated.’

In a statement provided to MailOnline Travel, Thomas Cook said it takes health and hygiene issues extremely seriously and it closely audits all the properties to which it operates. 

The travel company said its records show that sickness levels among customers staying at the resort were minimal during the couple’s stay.

A Thomas Cook spokesperson said: ‘The health and safety of our customers is of the utmost importance to us, and we are always concerned to hear of any illness reported while on holiday.

‘We can confirm that we have been approached by a no-win, no-fee lawyer on behalf of Ms Stannard and Mr Burns.

‘As a result, and while our investigation into the illness continues, we are unable to provide further comment so as not to prejudice any future legal proceedings.’

The statement added: ‘We are confident that those due to stay at the hotel will experience the excellent levels of quality and standards they would expect from Thomas Cook.

‘We ask any customers who may have concerns relating to their holiday to contact us directly and as quickly as possible so that we can deal with them personally in an open, honest and fair manner.’
