It might be the festive season but the pet hate of most Australians when they're dining out is parents not making sure their children are well behaved, 70 per cent in fact.

The dining etiquette of Australians are revealed along, with some rather annoying habits that make other diners see red, in a new survey by Yumtable.com.au.

It revealed almost half of us don't like waiting in line when going out for a bite to eat, with 41 per cent of diners not prepared to wait more than 10 minutes for a table over the festive period, and 28 per cent, only 15 minutes.

What really ticks us off when we are dining out, is unruly children but diners are nearly equally annoyed with drunk and obnoxious guests at 60 per cent, while 29 per cent have heard guests argue.

As for PDA (public displays of affection) a few diners weren't too impressed, with 13 per cent saying they've nearly lost their appetite watching loved up couples and seeing them play footsies under the table.

But while we are harsh critics when it comes to other diners it seems we're a little more relaxed when it comes to those we are dining with. 

'I'll have the chicken, take off the cheese, add avocado, no dressing on the salad ooohhh and swap chips for mash thanks,' 64 per cent of Australians say they don't mind a fussy eater.

As for those diners who have the nerve to snap their fingers to get the attention of waiters and waitresses, that's one of the biggest gripes for diners, considered a definite 'no no' while 46 per cent hate when other diners eat with their mouth open and smell food.
