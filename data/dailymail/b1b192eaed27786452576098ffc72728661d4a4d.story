Nightmares of snowstorms and flight cancellations are more common than visions of sugarplums around this time of year.

But luckily the weather seems to be helping the millions of holiday travellers by causing few delays as people head out to visit family over Christmas weekend.

As of Thursday evening, there was nothing to indicate any widespread weather disruptions at the beginning of the Christmas travel period.

Little to fear: While there may be some snow-related problems in New Mexico and Western Texas, the only other area is between Boston and New York where wind and fog may be an issue

Weather.com only listed Boston, New York, and Albuquerque as potentially risky airports, and even those weather warnings were limited to low clouds, rain, light snow and wind.

Road travel warnings are listed in Massachusetts, the Upper Hudson Valley of New York, the I-25 spanning from Wyoming to New Mexico, and the Texas panhandle.

Heavy snow did force the cancellation of more than 100 flights Thursday at Denver International Airport, one of the nation's busiest, but that tapered off by Thursday evening.

Severe thunderstorms are forecast today in the southeast part of the country, while snow falls in the mountains of New England.

Mountainous areas of New York state and New England were expected to get several inches of snow by Friday morning, and rain and thunderstorms were forecast down the coast to the Carolinas.

These unexpectedly pleasant weather warnings come a year after much of the East Coast was completely shut down from a massive pre-Christmas snowstorm.

Talk about changing times: The holidays last year (shown left in D.C.) were filled with snow as compared to this year (right, Minnesota) where much of the country is left brown and dry

The relatively-sunny outlook is good news as more Americans are expected to take long trips this holiday season.

About 92 million people will travel 50 miles or more from Friday through Jan. 2, an increase of 1.4 per cent more than last year, according to AAA.

The federation of motor clubs said 90 percent will travel by car. Drivers will find gasoline prices higher than last year, but well below this year's peaks.

Air travel will be down about 10 per cent.

Airlines have trimmed the number of flights and are packing planes fuller than ever before. That means if something goes wrong, there are fewer options to rebook stranded passengers. There are just no spare seats.

Bad weather also can mean more cancellations than in the past.

A Department of Transportation rule that went into effect in April 2010 limits planes to three hours on the tarmac. Airlines that violate it face penalties of up to $27,500 per person â€” that's more than $3.7million for just one Boeing 737.

That has made them skittish about operating in bad weather, leading to 20 per cent more cancellations in the typical month.
