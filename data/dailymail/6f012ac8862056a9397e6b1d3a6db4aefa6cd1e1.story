A Ryanair passenger got a surprise when he became the budget airline’s 13 millionth customer to pass through Shannon Airport yesterday.

Piotr Rachuta received a personal visit from the Dublin-based carrier’s controversial chief executive, Michael O’Leary, who is making strides to tone down his abrasive persona and improve his reputation in the public eye.

Mr O’Leary congratulated Mr Rachuta and his wife, Marta, and their four-year-old daughter, Amelia, and informed all passengers that they would be given a free flight.

The family, from Poland, was travelling from Shannon to Wroclaw when they were surprised by Mr O’Leary, who made the announcement as passengers waited at the gate.

Mr Rachuta told the Irish Independent: ‘I didn’t expect this today when I came to Shannon Airport for sure. I am very surprised and very happy.’

The Rachuta family was given a free flight and hotel accommodation, in addition to duty free vouchers and executive lounge passes.

Mr O’Leary said: ‘This is such an important flight for us because on today’s flight to Wroclaw, we have our 13th millionth passenger that Ryanair has carried through Shannon Airport.’

Mr Nice Guy: Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary has admitted that he should have been 'nicer' sooner

The publicity stunt was part of the airline’s charm offensive to win over customers and, ultimately, boost its traffic.

Mr O’Leary has admitted in interviews that the airline, notorious for its surcharges and customer service, should have been ‘nicer’ to passengers sooner.

The executive, who once called his customers ‘stupid’ and told refund-hunters to ‘f*** off’, has admitted his loose-lipped and coarse persona is perhaps bad for the airline’s brand.

He is trying to position himself as a warmer and friendlier executive as Ryanair looks to expand.
