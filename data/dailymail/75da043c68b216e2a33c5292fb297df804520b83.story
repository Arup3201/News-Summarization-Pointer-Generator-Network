WAITING FOR WILFRIED

City will understandably be anticipating new signing Wilfried Bony’s return from the African Cup of Nations next month. However it will be interesting to see how manager Manuel Pellegrini accommodates him in to the team. The Chilean seems happier to build his team around one central striker and – as fearsome as it will be – the Bony/Sergio Aguero partnership will perhaps require some tweaking elsewhere in the line-up to make it work.

Wilfried Bony is currently away in Equatorial Guinea with the Ivory Coast at the Africa Cup of Nations 

A CITY MAN GOES MISSING

Happily City are a club that still welcome supporters’ flags and banners but they may wish to consider where they put them. Two homemade efforts draped over the top tier on Sunday were so unfortunately placed that one of City’s own slogans read ‘...chester thanks you Sheikh Mansour’ and another was reduced to ‘The ONLY football team to come from ….chester’. 

TIME TO STRIP THINGS BACK

Whatever happened to the days when teams played in their most recognisable colours? Arsenal, we should remind ourselves, are a team that play in red and white. On Sunday they played a team wearing all blue. So what justification for wearing a ‘change’ strip that actually constituted more a colour clash than their usual one? None at all, clearly.

Manchester City's all blue kit wouldn't have clashed with Arsenal's red... so why do they have to wear yellow?

SUPPORT AT ALL LEVELS

City’s new Football Academy has had more openings than an envelope but on Sunday afternoon was one of which they really should be proud. The £200m facility was opened to spectators for the first time as Patrick Vieira’s EDS squad took on Schalke from Germany. It was freezing cold, foggy and then it started snowing. But City got more than 5,000 through the gate. A fine effort.

HEADER BY FERNAN...WHO? 

Sky commentator Martin Tyler suffered a case of mistaken identity yesterday, crediting Fernando with a header instead of Manchester City team-mate Vincent Kompany. Last week Sky pundit Charlie Nicholas was forced into making an on-air apology after mixing up Fernando witwh his colleague Fernandinho. Thankfully Sky didn’t feel the need this time. 

Patrick Vieira was in the stands at the Etihad, but earlier had steered the City Development team to victory

HELLO TO OLD FRIENDS

The tunnel at the Etihad Stadium is always a cosmopolitan place when these two clubs meet but yesterday there were so many hugs, handshakes and high fives going on in the moments before kick-off that it didn’t do much for the occasion’ s competitive edge. Further support, perhaps, for Graeme Souness’s pre-match theory on Sky that too many of Arsenal’s players would make ‘nice son-in-laws’.

Wilfried Bony is away at the Africa Cup of Nations but Manchester City will be glad to see him arrive in Manchester after the tournament

There were banner problems in the home end at the Etihad - City are the 'ONLY team to come from ...Chester' apparently

Man City played in blue, so why couldn't Arsenal wear their home red?

There was a battle on the pitch, but hugs all round in the Etihad tunnel
