She's always embraced her curves by wearing figure-hugging outfits and low-cut necklines.

However, Holly Willoughby may have just worn her most revealing outfit yet as she unleashed her inner vamp at the live final of The Voice on Saturday.

The mother-of-two showed off a lot of cleavage - and a lot of leg - in a daring black maxi dress with a naval-grazing neckline and thigh-high split.

Flashing the flesh: As well as her low-cut neckline, Holly was also showing off plenty of leg thanks to the thigh-high split

The 32-year-old certainly lived up to her 'Willoughbooby' nickname which she was famously given by her Celebrity Juice co-star Keith Lemon.

When the live show started on BBC1 on Saturday night, Holly was soon trending on Twitter due to her super sexy outfit.

However, she also made headlines for the wrong reasons when she declared Andrea Begley was the winner of The Voice 2003 - instead of 2013.

She realised her mistake and later tweeted: 'Well done Andrea!!! Can't wait till 2004! What a year that will be!!! Oops! X.'

Distracting: Holly's cleavage was a hot topic on Twitter as she talked to contestants, including Leah McFall

Even the official Voice Twitter feed 
commented on Holly's dress: 'WARNING: when you see what @hollywills is 
wearing, you might need a little lie down. #theVOICEukFINAL.'

Fashion critic Hilary Alexander tweeted: 'Holly Willoughby's cleavage and thigh split on #thevoiceuk reaches new lows and highs. No sudden movements Holly!'

One Twitter user wrote: 'Imagine if OFCOM receive a "number of complaints" about Holly Willoughby's dress tonight #theVOICEukFINAL.'

Another tweeted: '@BBCTheVoiceUK @hollywills put them away luv...... But I do like the dress.'

Another viewer commented: '@hollywills looks amazing on the voice but how on earth are her boobs staying in place??? I want what she's got!! #PerkyBoobs.'

Ahead of the show, Holly admitted she was losing her voice, which probably wasn't helped by the shouting she's known for doing into the microphone on the show.

Stealing the limelight: Some viewers tweeted they couldn't concentrate on the singing because of Holly's outfit

She wrote: 'So ironically my 'Voice' is getting more croaky/manly by the second! X.'

Holly recently admitted she didn't mind the public fixation on her cleavage and had embraced the attention, despite admitting she didn't understand it.

She said: "I don’t mind people fixating on my cleavage and I mainly blame Keith Lemon for bringing it into the main arena so people feel the need to talk about it all the time.

'But it’s fine, it’s fine - they’re only boobs.'

Defying gravity: Holly was clearly not wearing a bra under her daring dress

Oops! Holly declared Andrea Begley was the 'winner of The Voice 2003'
