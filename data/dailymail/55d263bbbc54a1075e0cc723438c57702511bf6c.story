Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood has appointed Tony Parks as his first team goalkeeping coach.

Former Tottenham Hotspur and Brentford goalkeeper Parks leaves his role at Norwich City to join Mark Robson, Kevin MacDonald and Seamus Brady in Sherwood's new-look backroom staff.

Parks and Sherwood worked together at White Hart Lane when the former succeeded Hans Leitert as goalkeeping coach in 2008 before his move to Carrow Road last year in July 2014.

Sherwood has been ringing the changes at Villa Park, having announced MacDonald as his assistant manager on Friday after first-team coach Robson and performance analyst Brady were confirmed.

Parks brings with him coaching experience for the Football Association and a professional playing career that lasted between 1980 and 2002 for 15 different clubs.

The 52-year-old spent six years at Tottenham - training Hugo Lloris, Brad Friedel, Heurelho Gomes and Carlo Cudicini - and was named goalkeeping coach of the year in 2013.

Sherwood became assistant manager of Spurs under Harry Redknapp a month before Parks was appointed, and trusts him in working with current goalkeepers Brad Guzan, Shay Given and Jed Steer.

Villa moved into the Barclays Premier League's relegation zone at the weekend following their 2-1 defeat by Stoke City at home. 

Next up for Sherwood is a trip to St James' Park to face Newcastle United on Saturday.
