A former lighthouse-keeper’s cottage which has no electricity and can only be reached by boat in the winter, has gone on sale for £225,000.

The isolated Rubha nan Gall cottage on the Isle of Mull in the Scottish Highlands is one mile away from the nearest town, Tobermory, and has no running water. During the winter months, the path to Tobermory is impassable, making the cottage accessible only by boat.

But the estate agents say its remoteness and lack of comforts are made worthwhile by the 156-year-old home’s spectacular waterfront views.

Isolated: This 156-year-old Rubha nan Gall cottage on the Isle of Mull is only accessible by boat in winter

Remote: The lighthouse is a mile away from the nearest town, but estate agents say its isolation is made up for by the stunning views

Views: The cottage is one mile north of Tobermory, Scotland and has views over the Sound of Mull and the old lighthouse

The cottage has four bedrooms, a sitting room, study, parlour, WC, washroom and seven storerooms, and when the weather is at its worst, the occupant requires a boat to come and go.

The only water supply is from a private spring on the estate, while heat is provided by solid fuel fires or stoves and light by paraffin lamps or gas lamps.

The home, which has not been lived in 
for years, boasts 80 acres of surrounding land and a mile of untouched 
shore front which includes the Rubha nan Gall lighthouse.It was put on the market for £225,000 with property agents Bell Ingram. 

Limited resources: The cottage does not have mains electricity and the only available water is from a spring located on the 80-acre estate

Surroundings: The cottage, which looks out onto the lighthouse, is only accessible by boat during the winter because the path leading to it becomes flooded and freezes over

Keeper: The Rubha nan Gall cottage still contains the keys to the lighthouse, but the buyers access to the landmark would be restricted

A spokesperson for the estate agency’s Oban office said: 'This is definitely a unique property which offers superb potential for a buyer who is really looking for the ultimate get-away-from-it-all property, or the buyer who is looking for a property in a stunning setting that can be developed into a luxury home.'The house in its current state offers a
real back-to-basics living experience - and while this may be appealing
to some buyers, there is potential for the property to be extensively 
modernised.

'It’s very secluded. There’s a one-mile 
pathway that you have to walk down to get there which you couldn’t even 
get a quad bike down.

Beautiful: The lighthouse one mile north of Tobermory on the Ardnamurchan Peninsula is inaccessible in winter but has spectacular views out over the Sound of Mull

'In winter the pathway is either turned into mud or ice and becomes impassable. The only way to travel to and from the cottage in winter months is by boat via the landing jetty.'

The spokesman insisted the price tag is all worth it for the stunning views and wildlife in the area.He added: 'Mull is famed across the UK and further afield for its rugged natural beauty and awe-inspiring coastline.

'To accompany the scenery, Mull has an incredible variety of wildlife including golden eagles, herds of red deer, and otters can occasionally be seen basking in the sheltered bays and dining on brown trout.'

The lighthouse and cottage, originally designed as two semi-detached houses, were built in 1857 by David and Thomas Stevenson.
