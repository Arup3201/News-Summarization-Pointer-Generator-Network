Leicester City have signed former Aston Villa midfielder Marc Albrighton on a four-year contract.

Albrighton will sign for the Foxes on July 1 when his contract with Villa has officially ended.

The 24-year-old has spent his whole career at Villa but struggled to nail down a first team place in Paul Lambert's side.

Albrighton told Leicester's official website: 'I’m absolutely thrilled to be joining. Everything about Leicester City is moving forward at the moment and it’s going to be a great Football Club to be a part of.

'It was a great 16 years for me at Villa and I had some really wonderful times there that will stay with me forever.'

Leicester also announced the signing of experienced defender Matthew Upson on Friday after the 35-year-old turned down a new contract offer from Brighton.
