Some might call her barking mad, but Alisha Caffrey thought nothing of throwing the wedding of the year - for her pet dogs.

Alisha, 27 from Liverpool, has had Eddie, a Yorkshire Terrier, and Squidgy, a Bichon Frise, since they were puppies, but after seeing their romance blossom and Squidgy giving birth to a litter, she didnâ€™t want them living in sin.

The pampered pooches, who get Christmas and birthday presents from Alisha, are now are officially dog and wife thanks to the service on Friday, which included a three-tier wedding cake and a custom made outfits.

girlfriend, but when Squidgy fell pregnant I looked into them getting 
married.

'I honestly didn't think we would be able to do it, but we organised everything and held the service on Friday.

'It was important to me that they tied the knot now that they have puppies together.'

Despite having dogs when she was younger, she didn't consider getting another one until she set her heart on a Bichon Frise puppy.

But before she could find one, she laid eyes on little Eddie and fell in love.

She said: 'I brought him home, but I still wanted a Bichon Frise - they are so cute when they are puppies. That's when I decided to get Squidgy. The two have been inseparable ever since.

'They are very spoiled - we celebrate their birthday and Christmas with chew toys and treats.

'Both of them are my babies. I treat them all the time and they both have little outfits that they wear.

'I don't think Peter really knew what he was getting himself into when he got me the dogs. He tells everyone I'm nuts but he loved the idea of the wedding and told all his friends.'

Alisha joked that Squidgy has stolen her dream wedding dress.

The gold bejewelled gown was designed and made by Angel Thomas who, at just 11-years-old owns her own dog clothing boutique, Pawabella.

Alisha said: 'Angel designed and made it for me and it's just like the one I would have worn myself.'It's gold with a taffeta skirt and loads of crystals - perfect for my princess.

'I can't believe I've been beaten down the aisle by my dog.'
