Google has hit back at Apple in the war of the map apps with the biggest ever update of its street view service, adding over 250,000 miles of roads around the world the the service.

It comes days after Google made Street View available to iPhone owners via a web browser, after Apple dumped Google's map app for its own.

Experts say the move is the latest round in the 'maps battle' between the two tech giants.

The updates places include Catherine Palace and Ferapontov monastery in Russia, the Chiang Kai-shek
Memorial Hall in Taiwan, or Stanley Park in Vancouver.

You can even 
virtually walk through the urban jungle of Singapore's Fort Canning Park, and visit the castle which inspired Hamlet.

'Today we’re making our Street View coverage more comprehensive than ever before by launching our biggest ever update--doubling our number of special collections and updating over 250,000 miles of roads around the world,' Google's Ulf Spitzer, Street View Program Manager, said in a blog post announcing the update.

'We’re increasing Street View coverage in Macau, Singapore, Sweden, the U.S., Thailand, Taiwan, Italy, Great Britain, Denmark, Norway and Canada. And we’re launching special collections in South Africa, Japan, Spain, France, Brazil and Mexico, among others. '

'We hope you enjoy taking a virtual stroll around some of the world’s
beautiful places, and stay tuned for more Street View updates as we 
look to make our maps more comprehensive and useful for you'

Stuart Miles of web site Pocket Lint said the move put Google's maps even further ahead of Apple.

'They will continue to try and improve as much as they can, and with Street View in particular its going to be critical for when Google introduces driverless cars.'

Google has already begun testing its driverless cars in Californai and Nevada. They will use Google's maps and Street View software to navigate.

'It's going to be very important for Google to have accurate maps,' said Miles.

'I'm not sure they care that much about Apple at the moment, they are so far ahead they just want to keep improving their product and made sure it stays the best on the market.

Google chairman Eric Schmidt says the biggest innovation from the firm is its driverless cars.

'It’s really an error that we’re allowed to drive the car,' he said in an interview with AllThingsD's Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher.

'Don't you want a car that drives you?' later calling it a 'life changing' experience.

The cars work by using a series of cameras to and laser scanners to constantly check their surroundings.

GPS systems built into the car  can pinpoint exactly where the car is, and the system uses Google's maps and Street View service to find its way around.

Google has already driven hundreds of thousands of miles in the cars, and believes they will soon become commonplace.
