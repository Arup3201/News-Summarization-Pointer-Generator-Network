Couples planning a romantic meal for two this Valentine’s Day might consider dining by candlelight.

But a new smart cork turns any empty wine bottle into an attractive light bulb for some standby ambient lighting.

The LED ‘bottlelight’ cork costs £10 ($15), can be charged using a USB socket to glow when it is switched on.

A new smart cork called the bottlelight lets you convert any empty wine bottle into a light (pictured) for some standby ambient lighting

SuckUK's Bottlelight can turn any empty bottle into a light.

It emits a warm, ambient glow much like a candle.

It costs £10 ($15) from the company's website.

The smart cork can be charged using a USB connection and one hour of energy produces two-and-a-half hours of light.

The top of the plastic device is made from real cork, which comes off to expose the USB part of the device.

It measures 2.3cm in diameter to fit most bottle necks and 5cm in height.

The light is amplified when placed in the neck of a bottle and can be turned on and off by twisting its white body.

An hour of charging provides around two-and-a-half hours of light, which should be enough for most dinners.

If the charge does run out, the innovative bottle stopper might at least provide a subtle hint for guests that have out-stayed their welcome that it is time to call it a night.

The device has a tough plastic body which houses the necessary wires.

The top is made from real cork, which is harvested sustainably in Portugal and this portion of the stopper can be pulled off to expose the USB connector, used to recharge the device.

It measures just under an inch (2.3cm) in diameter to fit most bottle necks and 5cm in height.

SuckUK, which makes the smart cork and is based in London believes its device will come in particularly handy in the summer, when a breeze is enough to extinguish candles stuck in the top of wine bottles.

The device can be ordered now from the company’s website.

The smart cork can illuminate your dinner for two-and-a-half hours - but if it does run out it might serve as a gentle reminder for you dinner guests to leave you in peace
