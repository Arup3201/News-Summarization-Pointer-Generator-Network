Demolition workers have finished knocking down the house where Mick and Mairead Philpott set a deadly blaze which killed their six children.

Work to pull down the fire-damaged semi-detached house in Derby began just after 8am with the final smoke-blackened wall demolished shortly after 2.30pm.

Clearing the remaining rubble and flattening the site is expected to take several more days.

Neighbours have welcomed the demolition of the house, although some said it brought back memories of happier times which were now painful to recount.

Demolition: Work began today on the demolition of Mick and Mairead Philpott's family home after they were jailed for starting a fire which killed their six children

Welcomed: Neighbours have welcomed the demolition of the house, which is expected to last several days

Memories: Peggy Perry-Tarrant, whose mother and father had lived in the house years before the Philpotts, was among those watching the demolition

Family: An aunt of the children also turned up to witness the demolition

Evidence of the intense black smoke thrown off by the fire became apparent as more of the house's innards were exposed during the work.

In one of the out-buildings a full-size snooker table was uncovered with the balls still set up, ready to play.

It will be sent to landfill along with all the other rubble.

There is also round-the-clock security at the site to stop people entering the site.

Mick and Mairead Philpott were jailed
in April, along with their friend Paul Mosley, after being convicted of
killing the couple's six children in the petrol-fuelled blaze in 
Allenton.

Jade 
Philpott, 10, and her brothers John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, and 
Jayden, five, died in the blaze in May 2012. Duwayne, 13, died days 
later in hospital.

Landfill: The bricks and tiles are to be taken away and ground to dust

Among those watching the digger pull the property apart was 65-year-old Peggy Perry-Tarrant, whose mother and father had lived in the house years before the Philpotts.

She recalled those happier times and said it was 'sad to see it coming down' but agreed it was the right thing to do.

'There's so many good memories there for our family, and it's ended in such a bad way,' she said.

'With every wall they pull down, it brings up another memory for each room coming to mind.

Tragic: Mick Philpott, with his six children - he is serving life in prison for their manslaughter

'We all think it's the right thing to do to take it down and when we walk on by we'll remember those kids and what happened there, and they'll never be forgotten.

'But then someone will build a new house for people to live in, and there'll be happy memories again.'

As she spoke she paused to look at the rubble, then took a photograph to send to her sister who now lives in Essex.

'It hurts to watch it - it's heartache, but it's the right thing to do,' she said.

'We'll have new life, new kids living there, and new memories.'

Work: A mechanical digger has started pulling down the former family home brick by brick, along with its neighbouring property

Witnessed: Other than workmen and members of the media, there were only a handful of witnesses to the start of the demolition

A mechanical digger has started pulling down the former family home brick by brick, along with its neighbouring property.

Daniel Walsh, managing director of Derby Demolition Ltd, said: 'It's a bit emotional, especially for the area.

'I think most of them (the neighbours) will be glad to see it gone. I think it's really sad what's happened and once it's gone it'll bring some sort of closure to it.'

Neighbour: A woman who lives opposite but declined to be named, said it was 'time it happened'

He said it will take two days to fully demolish the properties, then work will start to clear the rubble.

Other than workmen and members of the media, there were only a handful of witnesses to the start of the demolition with a few brief glances by passing schoolchildren and commuters walking to work.

One neighbour, a woman who lives opposite but declined to be named, said it was 'time it happened'.

She said: 'I'll be glad when it's gone because it's gone on so long. I knew the children, you see.

'It's become a monument for the wrong reasons.'

'Emotional': Daniel Walsh, managing director of Derby Demolition Ltd, said: 'It's a bit emotional, especially for the area'

Another neighbour said: 'We want it all done and dusted. We want it cleared, then we can all get on with our lives.'

As she looked on, she added: 'It gives me a funny feeling in the pit of my stomach just watching it.'

An aunt of the children also turned up to witness the demolition.

Staring intently at the work going on, she said: 'My niece, nephew and godson were in that house.'

She declined to comment further.

'We want it all done and dusted. We want it cleared, then we can all get on with our lives'Â

Last week, as workmen put up scaffolding around both vacant houses, Mairead Philpott's mother, Vera Duffy, briefly visited the scene to see the work going on.

The 55-year-old said: 'I'm here just to see it. The children will be resting in peace now.'

Derby City Council said demolition is likely to take up to two weeks, beginning with the outbuildings and roofing structures.

New social housing is expected to be built on the site in due course.

Derby Demolition Ltd, John L Morgan & Sons, Maxplant Ltd and Ward Recycling have each agreed to donate their fee for the demolition work to Derbyshire Children's Holiday Centre in Skegness, which provides disadvantaged local children with holidays in the Lincolnshire resort.
