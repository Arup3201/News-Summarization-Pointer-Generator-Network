It's one of the most colorful weekends on the calendar with Gay Pride events taking place around the world, but less than 45 years ago there were few celebrations of the LGBT community at all.

There were no openly gay politicians. No TV show had any identifiably gay characters. It was legal to fire gay men or women, and deny them housing.

When Hollywood made a film with a major homosexual character, the character was either killed or killed himself.

There were no openly gay policemen, public school teachers, doctors, or lawyers.

In 1970, to mark the first anniversary of the Stonewall uprisings, the very first Gay Pride marches took place in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Chicago.

And progress is still being made. This week the U.S. Supreme Court dumped the federal Defense of Marriage Act and declined to reinstate a ban on same-sex marriage in California.

Adopting the rainbow 'peace' flag as it's symbol, the early gay pride parades of 44 years ago depict a community coming out of the shadows and a little more reserved than today's colorful marches.

The New York Public Library archives has some pictures of the first-ever Pride parades around the world...

Brotherly love at Philadelphia's first Gay Pride rally: Obtaining gay rights was hard work and serious business in 1972

Equality for all: Philadelphia's first Gay Pride rally and march, June 11,1972

Where it all began: Gay Liberation Day march and dance, New York City, June 27, 1970

NYC parade: In the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, violent protests and street demonstrations took over the streets of New York after a police raid of Stonewall Inn

New York City Gay Liberation Day 1970: The now-legendary Greenwich Village gay bar saw the Stonewall Riots, these protests are commonly considered the tipping point  and the birth of the modern gay rights movement

On message: Gay Liberation Day march and dance, New York City, June 27, 1970

All walkers and no floats in 1970: GAA and Vito Russo marching in 1st Christopher St. Liberation Day Parade

North of the border: lesbian couple at Toronto's first Gay Pride Week, August 1972. Who knows if they're still together?

Gay couple at Toronto's first Gay Pride Week, August 1972: Now in 2013, Canada marked the 10th anniversary of its first same-sex marriage

Marching for a cause: For some equality is still a goal, not a reality, and the struggle is far from over

Chicago Gay Pride celebration, 1972: The first marches were both serious and fun, and served to inspire the widening activist movement; they were repeated in the following years

Fitting in instead of standing out: Pride marchers wanted to be seen as the same, not different

Light-hearted: Activists used humour to break the ice and win people to their cause

Coming together: It's easy to forget these people were marching FOR something as much as in celebration of something!

More and more annual marches started up in other cities throughout the world

In Atlanta and New York City and the marches were called 'Gay Liberation Marches'

In Los Angeles and San Francisco they became known as 'Gay Freedom Marches'

In the 1980s there was a cultural shift in the gay movement and the name 'Gay Pride' was adopted

Many parades still have at least some of the original political or activist character even if it can feel like Mardi Gras!
