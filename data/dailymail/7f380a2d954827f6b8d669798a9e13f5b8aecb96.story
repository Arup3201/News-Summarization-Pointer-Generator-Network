The Government’s controversial £50billion high-speed rail project has been given a damning ‘amber-red’ warning - meaning it is at serious risk of failure.

Spending watchdogs say successful delivery of the flagship 330-mile HS2 line, which will run from London to Birmingham and then onwards to the North, remains ‘in doubt’

They claim there are ‘major risks in a number of areas’ which require ‘urgent action’ if the scheme is to be saved.

The alarming assessment by the 
watchdog Major Projects Authority (MPA) appeared in its second annual 
report published by the Cabinet Office.

The report covers 199 projects across Whitehall departments - totalling what ministers admit is an ‘eye-watering’ £400billion of taxpayers’ money over their lifetimes. It rates the projects on a five tier traffic light system from red for ‘unachievable’ to ‘green’ for success being ‘highly likely.’

The delivery of two Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers was rated as 'red' for a second year in a row, while the controversial Universal 
Credit scheme was excluded from the review after it was 'reset' by Work 
and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith.

HS2's 'amber-red' rating follows an earlier row over the Government’s refusal to publish documents relating to an earlier damning assessment on the scheme.

The Information Commission is currently taking legal action to force the disclosure of those documents.

The new MPA assessment - covering the period from July to September last year - was welcomed by opponents of HS2, who have condemned the project as a ‘white elephant’ and an expensive ‘vanity project.’

But they also criticised the timing of the report’s release – the day after the local government and European elections as votes were still being counted – as ‘a good day to bury bad news’ and another example of Government ‘spin’.

In the foreword to the report, Francis Maude said the Government must identify and address problems early on before they become an issue

The 'amber-red' grading, the second worst of the five possible levels, means: ’Successful delivery of the project is in doubt, with major risks or issues apparent in a number of key areas. Urgent action is needed to ensure these are addressed, and whether resolution is feasible.’

The MPA report states: ‘The amber/red delivery confidence assessment on HS2, like other projects with a similar assessment, indicates that the focused attention that is being applied to addressing the remaining issues must continue.’

It adds: ‘High Speed Rail (HS2) is a high-profile example of a project that displays many of these challenges. It is not unusual for projects of this scale to have a lower delivery confidence assessment early in their project life, highlighting the substantial issues that inevitably remain to be resolved.

‘Significant progress has been made in the last year on HS2, for example in depositing the High Speed Rail Bill in Parliament and securing successful second reading in the Commons.’

But Penny Gaines who chairs campaign group Stop HS2 said: ‘The MPA have kept giving HS2 amber/red ratings. The Department for Transport may claim that it is a project in excellent shape, but the evidence says otherwise.’

And Richard Houghton of HS2Action Alliance said: ‘It’s no surprise the report concludes HS2 is at risk of failure. This project is running out of control.’

The Bill for HS2 recently survived its second reading - despite fury and a backbench rebellion by dozens of Tory backbenchers.

But a Department for Transport spokesman 
said: ‘As the MPA itself makes clear, HS2 has made significant progress 
in the eight months since the evidence for this report was gathered, 
most recently with MPs voting 452 to 41 in favour of the Second Reading 
of the hybrid Bill.

‘We have met all major milestones and are on track to have spades in the ground in 2017 as planned.

'HS2 is a vital part of the Government’s long term economic plan and we are determined to ensure Britain will benefit from the jobs, skills and extra capacity it will provide.’

In the foreword to the MPA report, Cabinet Office Secretary Francis Maude admits the budgets are ‘eyewatering’, but insists: ’Delivering projects will never be easy – they are some of the biggest and most complex things the Government will do.

'But we must not pretend problems don’t exist. Instead, we must identify and address them early on before they become an issue.’

And Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, wrote: ‘The Treasury remains committed to the  important work that this Government is undertaking to improve the  delivery of our most important projects.’

The report's publication comes as 
campaigners have been fighting for months to have details of earlier 
internal correspondence between ministers and HS2 Ltd made public.

In
 April, Britain’s freedom of information tsar announced he was to launch
 an ‘unprecedented’ High Court challenge against the Government after 
ministers used a wartime veto to censor embarrassing details about the 
controversial HS2 high speed rail project.

Information Commissioner Christopher Graham said he was seeking a judicial review of Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin’s decision to block publication of secret internal report highlighting official fears that the proposed £50billion project could fail – saying such censorship was ‘unlawful’.

Mr Graham said he had 'not taken the decision lightly’, but that a fundamental point of principle is at stake.

He added that ministers have acted unfairly and unreasonably in banning publication, despite there being ‘no demonstrable flaw in fact or law.’

The furious confrontation began in January when Transport Secretary Mr McLoughlin invoked rare emergency veto powers to ban publication of a damning Whitehall Project Assessment Report into the Government’s controversial HS2 high speed rail.

The banned report is also believed to have put an ‘amber-red’ rating on the scheme, suggesting it was in danger of failing.

Six months earlier, the Information Commissioner had already ruled that the Government had to disclose the controversial HS2 report. But the Government refused to comply.

And after first appealing against the decision. Ministers subsequently withdrew their appeal and in January, imposed a blanket veto of the kind issued in wartime.

Ministers argued the report into the Y-shaped line from London to Birmingham and beyond to the North, was private and confidential advice from civil servants to them, so shouldn’t be published. The veto aimed to  ensure that.

New figures revealed last week that taxpayer spending on consultants  for the controversial high speed HS2 project is accelerating 86per cent and £87million over budget.

Expert analysis of the Department for Transport’s spending to the end of February 2014 by construction magazine Building reveals that the Whitehall-run firm set up to manage the project - HS2 Ltd - has overshot its allocated £101m budget by £87million for four lots of professional services contracts.

That takes total spending on consultants to £188m – or 86per cent over budget.

Preparatory work on HS2 is set to start in 2016, ahead of building work in 2017.

The first phase from London Euston to Birmingham will be completed by 2026, with an ‘accelerated’ section to Crewe finished the following year.

The full route to Manchester and Leeds is expected to be completed by 2030.
