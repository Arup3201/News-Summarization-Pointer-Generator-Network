Time consuming: The big six energy firms have been criticised for making customers wait up to an hour before calls are answered

The big six energy firms have been criticised for making customers wait up to an hour before their calls are answered.

Researchers from BBC1's investigative programme Rip-Off Britain recorded call handling times for the UK's largest energy providers.

They targeted British Gas, nPower, E.ON, EDF Energy, Scottish Power and SSE, ringing them 14 times each over two days and recording the waiting times.

The longest time a caller was kept on hold was with Scottish Power - where it took an infuriating 53 minutes to be connected before the call was cut off.

But when researchers ran the company's helpline for new customers, all calls were answered within 90 seconds – with one being picked up within just 31 seconds.

On average, it took 34 minutes to be directed to one of the Scottish Power's agents, with the shortest time being 18 minutes, the Daily Star Sunday reported.

The firm with the second longest waiting time was nPower, which took an average of 13 minutes and 30 seconds to connect.

The shocking findings follow energy regulator Ofgem's report that there have been more complaints about the six firms in the first quarter of 2014 than ever before. 

Pete Murray from consumer magazine Which? said: 'Energy companies need to up their game and make sure they answer phone calls quickly.

'Existing customers need to be treated in the same way as new customers and that is something energy companies have got to put right.' 

Scottish Power blamed a new £200million account management system on their dismal call handling times, saying that it had caused a 'dip in customer service levels'.

But in another call handling test conducted last year, the company again recorded the worst waiting time for a single call at 46 minutes.  

The firm now claims to have taken on hundreds of additional call handlers and to have extended call centre opening hours to improve its service.

The longest time a caller was kept on hold was with Scottish Power - where it took 53 minutes to be connected before the call was cut off

British Gas performed well in the investigation, with the average waiting time amounting to just 2 minutes and 14 seconds. 

All six companies told Rip-Off Britain that they are committed to customer service and to dealing with calls quickly.

The investigation into waiting times will be aired on Rip- Off Britain tomorrow on BBC1 at 9.15am
