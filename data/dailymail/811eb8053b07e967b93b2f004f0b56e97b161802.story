If Californians thought they had it rough dealing with the drought plaguing the state they now have a new concern. The dry spell is causing a higher number of skunks to come out of the woods and into residential areas as they look for food and water.

The problem is particularly bad in El Dorado County, an area east of the capital, Sacramento, in the famous Gold Country.

Jennifer Hamburg of the El Dorado Animal Control Division told CBS Saramento that in a typical year, the department gets between five and seven reports of skunk sightings. But in the last two months alone, she has received word of 7 sightings. And alarmingly, many of the sightings are in residential areas.

Rabid skunks are on the rise in some parts of California as the drought there is causing more skunks to come out to search for food and water

While skunks are usually harmless as long as you keep your distance from them, Hamburg said the drought is causing some skunks to become more hostile.

“They’re dangerous in the fact that the calls that we have received so 
far seem to be they are a little bit more aggressive complaints,' she said. 'They are charging after people’s dogs.'

Rabid skunks can be spotted as they tend to have trouble walking or drinking water. And if your pet spends time outside, it's best to have them vaccinated against rabies as well.

Unfortunately, the drought situation doesn't seem to be letting up anytime soon.

Residents say some of the skunks seen have been aggressive even charging at their dogs

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Thursday released its seasonal outlook. The agency found that California just had its warmest and third driest winter on record. However, NOAA added that the drought is expected to persist or intensify.

And if that wasn't enough of a concern, a good portion of the state is under an above average wildfire threat for the spring.
