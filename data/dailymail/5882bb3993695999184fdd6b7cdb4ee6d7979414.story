At least seven people are feared missing after parts of a major road tunnel collapsed west of Tokyo - trapping vehicles as smoke from a fire inside initially prevented rescuers from approaching.

Several burned bodies have reportedly been found among the rubble at the Sasago Tunnel, around 50 miles outside the capital.

Video footage from cameras inside the tunnel, after the fire was extinguished, showed firefighters picking their way through cement roof panels that collapsed onto vehicles.
