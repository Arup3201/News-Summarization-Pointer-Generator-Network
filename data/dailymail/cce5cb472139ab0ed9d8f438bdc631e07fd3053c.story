Fernando Alonso is wanted by McLaren and may well end up there.

It is understood from sources close to the situation that meetings have recently taken place to this end. Although Ron Dennis, the McLaren chairman, and Alonso fell out in 2007, the animosity may not prevent a reunion.

Dennis wants to sign a big name. Alonso is struggling to obtain success at Ferrari. McLaren's partnership with Honda, which starts next year, offers an obvious attraction.

As does the fact Eric Boullier, the new de facto team principal, is unconnected to the 2008 turbulence.

The notion of Alonso leaving Ferrari was fuelled this week, when he said: 'It is sometimes strange to see good comments and compliments from people outside the team, and the opposite from people who are supposed to be close to you.

'It's motivating for me and to see good comments and is funny when you see the opposite from your closest friends.'

This outburst prompted Ferrari president Luca di Montezemolo to issue an unusual statement-cum-love letter.

He said: 'Fernando is the best driver in the world, who always gives 200 per cent in the races.'

Alonso may end up staying, but at this stage I would be tempted to put a fiver on him going to McLaren.  

Tough going: Jenson Button, pictured here in practice, and team-mate Kevin Magnussen have struggled in 2014

The only problem that people in Monaco have ever had with alcohol has been trying to walk down the gangway.

But while the champagne-fuelled roistering is in full swing on lilting yachts, miserable plans are afoot to ban all alcohol advertising from sport, including Formula One.

In an echo of the ban on tobacco advertising, a pincer movement is starting to move across the continent. France has already outlawed alcohol advertising: what we call the Heineken Cup is called the H Cup just over the border from Monaco.

Other countries will follow suit, experts say, and then the European Union will introduce a Europe-wide ban. Labour have included a ban in their draft manifesto for next year's general election.

This move is bad news for the likes of Williams with their Martini sponsorship, Force India with Smirnoff, and McLaren with Johnnie Walker.

In all, drink advertising brings £300million into British sport. The FA Cup (Budweiser), the Grand National (Crabbie's) and Everton FC (Chang Beer) would all lose out.

Dr Kerry O'Brien, head of behavioural studies, at Moash University, Melbourne makes the case for the ban.

It sounds sanctimonious rubbish to me but here goes: 'Formula 1 has displayed such strong leadership in ensuring their driver safety, so it seems odd that they remain happy to promote alcohol given its a factor in around one third of all road fatalities in western nations.

I'll drink to that: Williams' title sponsor this season is alcohol brand Martini

'We know that young people are particularly influenced by alcohol sponsorship and advertising, with those exposed to alcohol marketing early in life more likely to be problem drinkers later in life. Unfortunately, young men are also much more likely to die from drink driving than any other group.

'Expecting a few anti-drink driving messages to reduce the problem of drink driving in the face of a 1000 times more "please drink alcohol messages" along with heavy alcohol discounting, defies logic.

'If you really thought you needed to address alcohol consumption and drink driving you would not put alcohol and driving together in the first place.

'Formula One has some of the most intelligent and decent folk you could meet, but you really don't need to be smart to know that alcohol and driving cars don't go together in any context. But young people watching Formula One could certainly gain that impression with the current alcohol sponsorship arrangements.

'France took the global lead in banning alcohol sponsorship and advertising, and it didn't affect the success of sport in their country. Indeed they hosted the very successful 1998 FIFA World Cup, and won it! Perhaps Formula One can be the moral leaders of international sport and be the first to ban alcohol sponsorship and advertising.'

I have never heard anyone in Formula One say that they want alcohol advertising banned. It seems illiberal to me. People, I would argue, should be able to decide for themselves whether they want to buy drinks or not.  Where will all this legislation end? With bans on drinking in public places?    

Driving seat: Lewis Hamilton leads the drivers' championship by three points from team-mate Nico Rosberg

Lewis Hamilton said this week that he is 'hungrier' for success than Nico Rosberg because he, unlike his team-mate, was not born into privilege.

Now think if Rosberg had made the claim in reverse. If he had said his more expensive education, for example, made him better equipped for Formula One. Imagine the outrage.  

I think Hamilton was on to something, though. There is a certain chippiness to Lewis and his father, Anthony (and I say that more admiringly than critically).

Anthony, it always struck me, had a sense of 'Lewis and me against the world,' derived from their lowly beginnings as a poor immigrant family. This is part of what made them so successful and Anthony such a power for good as a father.

As promised last week, I returned to the track at Monaco to sample the new, quieter engine noise. Would it, I wondered, damage my enjoyment of watching the cars at close quarters, especially around the swimming pool.

The answer is yes and no.

Yes: because there was a lack of sheer screaming violence. No: I was not deafened. I feel my quandary is shared by many within Formula One.
