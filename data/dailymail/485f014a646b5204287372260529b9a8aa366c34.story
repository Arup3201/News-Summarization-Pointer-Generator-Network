Court case: Lawyers for the French woman, known only as SAS, said that her religious rights were being violated by France's burka ban (picture posed by model)

Lawyers for France’s Socialist government today insisted that it would be ‘undemocratic’ for European judges to reverse the country’s burka ban.

The made their claims during a hearing of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in which a 23-year-old Muslim is challenging the legislation.

It was introduced in 2010, and prohibits the wearing of full-face veils, with offenders facing fines of up to 125 pounds.

Ramby de Mello, a British lawyer representing the plaintiff – who was only referred to her by her initials of SAS – said she currently felt like ‘a prisoner in her own country’ and that the veil was ‘as much part of her identity as our DNA is of ours’.

But Edwige Belliard, for the French government, said the ban was ‘democratic’ and was backed by ‘a strong conviction among the French public’.

Ms Belliard added: ‘Wearing the full veil not only makes it difficult to identify a person, it makes her indistinguishable from other full veil wearers and effectively erases the woman who wears it.’

In a statement presented to the ECHR yesterday, SAS said she is a ‘devout Muslim and she wears the burqa and niqab in accordance with her religious faith, culture and personal convictions.’

It comes as President Francois Hollande’s government firmly implements a ban which has seen ordinary housewives arrested and criminalised in court.

There have also been a number of vigilante attacks on women seen wearing the veil illegally.

In a related development, the Paris Appeals Court today agreed that a private nursery had been justified in firing an assistant director who refused to remove her Islamic headscarf at work.

Fatima Afif was sacked from the Baby Loup nursery school, in the Paris suburb of Chanteloup-les-Vignes, five years ago under the nursery's private rules.

Such measures are viewed as highly repressive by Muslims living in France, who make up a community of more than five million people.

Religious dress: A statement read to the court explained that the woman wears both the burka, left which covers the whole face, and the niqab, right, which leaves a gap for the eyes (pictures posed by models)

Decision: The European Court of Human Rights, pictured, is expected to rule on the case in 2014

Mr Hollande and his ministers insist 
the so-called burka ban is needed to protect France’s secular traditions
and to stop potential terrorists and thieves using veils as disguises.

But the ban has increased social tensions, with Muslims complaining of increased discrimination since it was introduced.

There
were serious disturbances in the Paris suburb of Trappes this summer 
after a man was arrested for attacking a police officer who stopped his 
wife for wearing a veil.

After
the violence in Trappes, French Interior Minister Manuel Valls said: 
‘The law banning the full-face veil is a law for women - it is not for a
second a law against Islam.’

Belgium
and some parts of Switzerland have followed France’s lead in banning 
the veil, while Italy and Holland are also considering outlawing it.

There
have been calls for a similar ban in Britain, but David Cameron’s 
government has to date shown no interest in implementing one.

The ECHR is expected to make a decision next year.
