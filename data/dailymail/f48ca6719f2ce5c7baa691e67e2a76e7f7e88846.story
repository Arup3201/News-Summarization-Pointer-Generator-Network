At 5ft 11in, Prince Charles is no small fry. But today the heir to the throne was dwarfed by Penny Lancaster as he welcomed the leggy blonde to a Prince's Trust reception.

The
6ft 1in model towered over the prince at the event this morning, when she joined him to open to open his organisation's new office.

As Prince's Trust ambassadors, Penny and singer husband Rod Stewart, along with designer Kelly Hoppen, were invited by Prince Charles to join him in opening the doors to the Prince's Trust's
new offices.

Hello up there! Prince Charles is towered by 6ft 1in model Penny Lancaster as he opens his new Prince's Trust store in London today

The trust has moved from its former home near London's West End to a building close to the financial heart of the capital.

Penny, 41, looked younger than her years in a tight leather pencil skirt and on-trend animal print T-shirt, which she teamed with black heels.

Her husband Rod, 68, looked smart in a navy blue blazer and red chinos, which he coordinated with his shoes and tie.

The
couple laughed with Charles as they posed for photographs despite the 
veteran rocker and his wife arriving late for the event.

Protocol
dictates that members of the Royal Family arrive last for a public 
engagement - with the Queen usually turning up just minutes before an 
event begins.

But 
Stewart and his wife, Penny Lancaster, blamed London traffic for their 
10-minute delay while travelling from their Wapping apartment, and the 
singer apologised to the Prince when the pair eventually met.

Charles
had already opened a Prince’s Trust shop, near the City of London, 
called Tomorrow’s Store, which sells jewellery, clothing, shoes and 
decorative objects designed by young entrepreneurs who have been helped 
by his charity.

After the apology, the two men were soon sharing a joke and when the Prince asked how the singer’s voice was, Stewart replied 'improving with age' and his wife quipped 'like a lot of other things'.

Stewart, a Prince’s Trust Ambassador along with his wife, said afterwards that he always tells he children to be on time: 'We have a place over in Wapping and it took us three-quarters of an hour to get here.'

He added, laughing: 'I wish I had my own police escort, I would always be on time.'

Ms Lancaster praised the work of the Prince’s Trust, which has helped young entrepreneurs through its business enterprise programme.

Referring to her husband, she said: 'We both became ambassadors about 10 years ago. We are able to inspire and encourage our children, who have a strong support system and financial support. But what about the children that don’t have that support system? The Prince’s Trust is a real helping hand - it’s fantastic.'

The Tomorrow’s Store is within the new offices of the Prince’s Trust, which moved from its former home near London’s West End to a building close to the financial heart of the capital after the lease on its previous premises expired.

Bending down? Penny appeared to be crouching low as she posed for photographs and shared a few jokes with the Prince

Charles is taking part in a number of 
engagements this week to highlight the work of his charities, which 
Clarence House said had given business support to almost 400,000 and 
helped created more than 125,000 entrepreneurs.

During his visit to the new offices, Charles received two presents for his new grandson, Prince George of Cambridge.

Kimberly
Smith, who runs a children’s clothes shop in Port Talbot, South Wales, 
had some of her garments on sale in the new store and presented Charles 
with a baby bib decorated with the flags of the UK’s four nations.

The
Prince also accepted a blue romper suit decorated with elephants from 
Cecilia Crossley, chief executive of the company From Babies With Love, 
which donates its profits to good causes.

Ms
Crossley’s business has received marketing help from Arc, a programme 
run by the charity Business in the Community (BITC), which has Charles 
as its president.

The 
Prince met other business people who have benefited from Arc, which was 
established in 2011 and aims to connect social entrepreneurs in the 
Olympic host boroughs with expert support from companies like BP, 
Deloitte and Visa Europe.

Penny, 41, looked young beyond her years in a stylish outfit consisting of a black leather skirt and on-trend animal print top

Charles
officially opened the new Prince’s Trust offices and, speaking about 
the start of the Trust in 1976, told the staff: 'I can never get over 
how everything has grown from such a small desk - one man and a dog - 
and I was the dog.'

He 
added: 'It is extraordinary for me just to see the expansion - in staff 
numbers, the huge numbers of people in different teams.'

He went on to tell them he felt 'pride' at the success people have achieved after being helped by his Trust.

Ahead
of the opening, the Prince of Wales shone a light on young 
entrepreneurs helped by his trust when he visited a London shop stocked 
with their innovative products.

Charles toured Tomorrow's Store near the City of London where jewellery, clothing, homeware and stationery were on sale.

Charles
also met people who have been taking part in the Arc programme run by 
the charity Business in the Community (BITC), which has the Prince as 
president.

Arc
is BITC's flagship enterprise programme which began in 2011 and aims to
connect social entrepreneurs in the Olympic host boroughs with expert 
support from companies like BP, Deloitte and Visa Europe.

The programme focuses on job creation and boosting social enterprise growth.

Later
today Charles, president of the Prince's Initiative for Mature 
Enterprise, will host a reception to celebrate entrepreneurs who have 
benefited from the project, its supporters and volunteers.
