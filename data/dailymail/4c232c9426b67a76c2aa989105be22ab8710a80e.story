Some Liverpool fans might look down tonight’s team-sheet and wonder who many of the Bournemouth side are. But one name will evoke pain, far more even than was felt during the weekend humbling at Old Trafford.

It’s five years since Dan Gosling waltzed inside the Park End penalty area at Goodison Park in the dying minutes of extra time to score the winner in a fourth-round FA Cup Merseyside derby replay.

The goal went down in Everton legend. Then 19, Gosling became big business overnight but saw a hugely impressive start curtailed by two season-ending injuries.

With the scores tied 0-0 in the 2009 fourth-round replay, Gosling fires a shot just two minutes before full-time

Now, under the watchful eye of Eddie Howe, Gosling and the rest of this small seaside town are ready to have a crack at Brendan Rodgers’ beleaguered Reds in tonight’s Capital One Cup quarter-final.

‘It was a proud moment, one of the greatest of my career so far,’ says Gosling, reflecting on a goal that half the country didn’t see after television feeds momentarily failed.

‘It flashed back on when I was at the bottom of the pile. It cut off down in Brixton where my mum lives, but they made the Tic Tac advert out of it (the company recreated the goal), so it probably got more exposure than it would’ve done. It’d be nice to replicate it tonight.’

Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has steered his side to the summit of the Championship table 

While the central midfielder is finding it difficult to force his way into the Championship table-toppers’ league side, the former Newcastle man has been key in this cup run.

Bournemouth are the top scorers in the country, and a 12-match unbeaten run has propelled them from quirky outsiders to potential New Year league leaders.

Gosling and Howe laughed off suggestions that they are favourites for tonight’s tie, but the problems sweeping Anfield makes this a tougher result to call than it was when they met in January.

Why the Cherries, whose 12,000-capacity Goldsands Stadium would be the smallest ever in the top flight, are performing way above their natural station is no mystery. Howe is the hottest young property in English management.

‘Training’s very intense,’ says Gosling. ‘It gets videoed, so there’s no slacking off. We video every training session, and the coaching staff watch it every afternoon.’

That has the stamp of Rodgers on it. The two managers are good friends and Howe has observed his methods. But this level of analysis isn’t even common practice in the Premier League. ‘Sometimes you get pulled in the morning after yesterday’s display,’ Gosling adds. ‘When I signed and they told me I was a bit like, “really?” I didn’t believe it.

‘Whether it’s rain, snow, the cameras are always up. You end up forgetting about it. This is your profession. If you’re not working hard and not enjoying it there’s something wrong.

‘Our manager is so young (37) and so clever tactically. To know all the stuff he does is amazing really.

‘When we do some of the drills — how has he thought of them? Give me a week and I wouldn’t think of some of the passing drills he does.’

Howe puts his rise down to watching football all week, every week, much like Roberto Martinez or Rodgers. When asked exactly how much he watches, Howe said: ‘I would have to lie — my wife will see this.’

As for Gosling, he hopes a Bournemouth goal to sink Liverpool will be replayed just as many times as that one back in 2009.
