A psychologist who is accused of decapitating her abusive husband before scattering his remains across Mexico City allegedly sent text messages from his phone so friends and family would think he was still alive.

Maria Alejandra Lafuente Caso, 40, who claimed she had been repeatedly beaten by her husband Allan Carrera Cuellar, 41, drugged him by slipping sleeping pills into his drink at their home in the Mexican capital.

Prosecutors allege she then took his chainsaw to dismember his body and wrapped his remains in several black bags, before disposing of them across the city.

Police launched an investigation after children discovered his head while playing in a local park.

His hands and feet were later found in another part of the city.

But so that friends and family would not ask where he was, she told them he had gone on a business trip and allegedly sent them text messages from his phone.

A police spokesman said: 'Before the body parts were found she convinced everyone that he was alive and well by sending text messages.

'After we found the remains and managed to identify him from DNA, she pretended to be a grieving widow.

'But a forensic examination of her home found traces of his blood and bone gristle in the carpets and bits of flesh in the bathroom.

'She then tried to have herself sectioned using her knowledge of mental illness as a psychologist so she wouldn't have to stand trial for his murder.

'But we had a doctor carry out tests and she is of perfectly sane mind.'

Ms Caso is currently awaiting trial in Mexico City where she is accused of murdering her husband.
