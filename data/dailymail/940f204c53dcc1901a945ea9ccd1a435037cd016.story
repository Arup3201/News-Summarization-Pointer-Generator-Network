Labour risks being out of power until 2030 if Ed Miliband fails to win next year’s election, former Cabinet minister David Blunkett has warned.

In a stark message to the party, the ex-Home Secretary claimed Labour would be left in the ‘wilderness for as much as 15 years’ if the Tories remain in power in 2015.

The blunt message came as pressure mounts on Mr Miliband, after a string of gaffes and dire opinion polls which suggest voters do not think he is up to the job of being Prime Minister.

Former Home Secretary David Blunkett warned defeat in 2015 for Ed Miliband would leave Labour in the 'wilderness' for 15 years

With less than a year to go, senior Labour figures have begun to voice doubts about Mr Miliband’s ability to seal the deal with the electorate.

Mr Blunkett insisted he thought Mr Miliband could win the election and was the 'only man' for the job of leading the party.

But he issued a warning that if Labour loses next year, the party will be out of office for a generation.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I think we would be in the wilderness for as much as 15 years because all the changes that the Conservative majority government would bring in would actually not be about fairness or equity or even sharing power, it would be about excluding the Labour Party.

‘We are talking about the future of the people we care about, we are talking about how we handle continuing levels of austerity and fairness, and whether the rich get richer and those at the very, very sharp end of austerity measures, the loss of public services gets worse.

‘Yes, we are talking about whether the vehicle for achieving everything that I stood for, and I have been in the Labour Party for 51 years, would be made that much more difficult by victory in 2015 by the Conservatives.’

The blind former home secretary told his local party in Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough that he would not seek re-election in next year's contest, ending a career as an MP which began in 1987.

Labour is ahead in the opinion polls but voters are less impressed with Mr Miliband as a leader

Just 11 per cent of people think Mr Miliband is a strong leader and only 21 per cent say he is up to the job of being Prime Minister

Meanwhile John Denham, a former frontbencher trying to win back support in the south of England, warned the party is losing working class voters.

He told a One Nation conference on June 5 that warned that working-class voters 'don't believe they are in any story that Labour is telling about the future of this country', the Sunday Times reported..

‘They can list lots of other people that they think are in Labour's story, but not them. And it's not a matter of having a policy for this or for that, but actually including them legitimately in the story and saying: 'You are part of the people that we're here for.

He added: 'If they're not part of our story I don't know what the Labour party is for.'

A YouGov poll for the Sunday Times showed just 11 per cent of people think Mr Miliband has been a strong leader, 21 per cent say he is up to the job of being Prime Minister and only 25 per cent think he is in touch with ordinary people

To add to the sense of crisis, former leader Neil Kinnock rushed to Mr Miliband’s defence.

Lord Kinnock, who led Labour to two crushing defeats in the 1980s and 1990s, praised Mr Miliband’s ‘great personal and political courage’.

In an interview with The Observer, Lord Kinnock blamed the media for the leader’s woes and hit out at the 'vindictiveness' of the press.

But he added: 'It won't stop him; his genuine strengths of thought, action and toughness will get through and help to win victory.'

Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna took to the airwaves to defend his leader as a 'man of great beliefs'.

Mr Miliband has faces claims he has developed big political concepts but fails to connect with voters on a day-to-day basis.

Mr Umunna told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: 'We are not playing some game of Celebrity Big Brother. We are talking about big issues that are affecting all of our different communities - how are we going to pay our way in the world, how are we going to ensure that everybody can achieve their dreams and realise their aspirations?

'If Ed is guilty of focusing on the issues that people really care about and taking a serious, deep, hard long look at what needs to happen in our economy to change it, then fine.

'Because that is what he is seriously focused on.'
