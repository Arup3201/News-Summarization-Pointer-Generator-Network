MPs warned last night that NHS hospitals could go bust as a result of Labour’s botched PFI deals.

Many trusts’ chances of breaking even were being undermined by ‘unaffordable’ contracts with private sector companies under the much-derided private finance initiative, the Public Accounts Committee said.

But members also criticised the present Government for having no idea how to respond if a trust does go bankrupt and is forced to close down – saying the controversial reforms imposed on the NHS could make things worse.

Former Health Secretary Andrew Lansley put South London NHS Trust in the failure regime - the trust was losing more than £1 million per week

They said it appeared the Department of Health was ‘inventing rules and processes on the hoof’ to deal with hospital trusts which get into financial difficulties.

It raises the possibility of communities being left without vital services because managers at their local trust have not been able to keep the organisation solvent. At least 22 trusts, running 60 units, are facing severe problems as a result of PFI burdens, and earlier this year the DoH had to put in £1.5billion to bail them out.

But the Coalition’s reforms will devolve the vast majority of the NHS budget to GPs, meaning there will be less available for the central department to prop up failing trusts. The committee said ministers had done nothing to establish a robust protocol for action should a hospital go bust.

Chairman Margaret Hodge said ministers were unable to provide MPs with reassurance that financial problems will not damage the quality of care or access experienced by patients of troubled trusts, at a time when the service is already struggling to find £20billion-worth of cuts.

Although NHS bodies reported an overall surplus of £2.1billion in 2011-12, the apparently healthy financial picture masked a ‘significant minority’ of bodies which are in difficulties, said the report.

Ten NHS trusts, 21 foundation trusts and three primary care trusts reported a combined deficit of £356million, £115million of which was accounted for by two London trusts, one of which was put into special administration in July.

A further 31 struggling NHS trusts and 11 foundation trusts may not have broken even if they had not been bailed out with cash injections worth £1.1billion from the department and other NHS organisations, said the report.

During the committee’s inquiry into the future financial sustainability of the NHS, the department was unable to explain clearly how the ‘failure regime’ would work under the new arrangements, or what circumstances would trigger it being applied to a struggling hospital.

'Ensuring a viable financial future for healthcare providers is vital if the public are to have confidence in the delivery of their local services,' said the report.

'Yet we still do not have critical details of how the new system introduced by the NHS reforms will work so that services remain available to patients in their locality.'

Mrs Hodge said: 'The Department of Health could not explain to us how it will deal with an NHS trust that goes bankrupt. Nor could it provide reassurance that financial problems would not damage the quality of care or equality of access to all citizens, wherever they live.

She added: 'We are particularly concerned that the financial viability of a number of trusts is being undermined by the fact that they are locked into unaffordable PFI contracts.

'It is unclear how the department will continue to underwrite payments once most of the money moves to the NHS Commissioning Board.’

The MPs’ warning came on the day that administrators of an NHS trust on the brink of bankruptcy said it should be dissolved, with the possibility that one of its hospitals will be run by a private company.

The South London NHS trust was losing more than £1million a week. Special administrator Matthew Kershaw said a nearby A&E department should close down and the Princess Royal hospital in Farnborough, near Bromley, should be taken over by another provider.

Former health secretary Andrew Lansley put the trust in the failure regime after it emerged that it ran up deficits of more than £150million over the past three years.

Sources close to Mr Lansley said long-standing difficulties had been made worse by two PFI deals which are now costing £61million a year in interest. Mr Kershaw said PFI debts accounted for ‘around a third’ of the trust’s £65million overspend in the last financial year.
