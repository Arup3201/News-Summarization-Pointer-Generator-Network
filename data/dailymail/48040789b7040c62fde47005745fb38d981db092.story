McLaren racing director Eric Boullier has revealed the team may yet embark on their new partnership with Honda later this year.

After a seven-year absence, when Honda ran their own team, they will be back in 2015 as power-unit supplier to McLaren, replacing Mercedes.

It reunites one of the most famous partnerships in the history of the sport as McLaren-Honda won four consecutive constructors' titles from 1988-91, as well as four drivers' crowns - three for Ayrton Senna and one for Alain Prost.

Relationship: McLaren and Honda will renew their relationship next season

Honda motorsport boss Yasuhisa Arai claimed earlier this week the world would have to wait until the first test in Jerez in February for the new McLaren-Honda to hit the track.

But Boullier reckons there is a possibility the car could be seen for the first time at a two-day test in Abu Dhabi in November that follows immediately after the final grand prix of the campaign.

Asked as to Arai's comments in Monza ahead of the race in Italy, Boullier replied: 'I am 100 per cent aware.

'There is constant and consistent communication between both companies, so we know exactly where we go.

Test: Eric Boullier said that the date the car will be tested is unsure but it will be before Jerez

'Regarding the first test of the McLaren/Honda-powered car, there is no decision yet about when and where. This is still open.

'It is true there was a comment, but we will not give a definite answer now because we do not know exactly, but it is very likely it will be before Jerez.'

Asked whether that could be in Abu Dhabi, Boullier said: 'Yes.

'This is not definite. It is true the safe side is we will be in Jerez with a McLaren-Honda car.

'But we are keeping the door open to run earlier should everything match our schedule.'
