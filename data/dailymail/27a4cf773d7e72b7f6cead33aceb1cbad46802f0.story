Orangutans have an 'innate' ability to use Apple iPads - and enjoy using the touchscreens, say researchers at a Milwaukee zoo.

The great apes at a Milwaukee zoo enjoy video-calling other apes on their iPads via Skype, and like watching other zoo creatures such as penguins. They can even draw their own artworks.

'The Apple iPad is a perfect device for orangutans,' say the researchers.

The 'Apps for Apes' project came into being because orangutans need constant stimulation - otherwise they become bored or depressed

The 'Apps for Apes' project came into being because orangutans need constant stimulation - otherwise they become bored or depressed.

Previous experiments have proved that the animals have an innate ability to use touchcreens.

'The original idea came literally when Steve Jobs gave his opening presentation 
introducing the iPad,' said conservationist Richard Zimmerman.

'Independently, one of our supporters in Milwaukee was at the zoo showing the 
orangutan his iPad, and they were fascinated by it. We started to put things 
together.'

An orang utan watches an animated book on iPad. Even when not watching each other, the apes seem to enjoy colours and movement, the researchers say

The apes can recognise and enjoy videos of other animals such as penguins - and even make their own art.

But it's video-calling that might be the most valuable - particularly for lonely apes in zoos far away from their homes.

'By using wireless Internet connections 
and free video technology such as Skype, orangutans - with close 
guidance from their keepers - can communicate with each 
other over long distance, keeping mothers and babies in contact,' say the researchers.

The reseachers are now looking for donations of 'lightly used' iPad for the orangutans - who have a habit of damaging the devices.

'We would like to consult with Apple's 
engineers to work together to make them as 'orangutan-proof' as 
possible,' say the researchers.

The devices could also be useful for educating orangutans in zoos about how to survive in the wild.

'It can show images of foods they can eat as well as those to avoid. They will be able to learn about predators and learn how to climb and navigate their way around the treetops by watching video footage of orangutans in action,' say the researchers.

The researchers are now asking for donations of 'lightly used' iPads - and hope for technical help to make them more 'orangutan proof'

'We are planning to eventually incorporate the devices into rescue and rehabilitation centers in Indonesia in order to allow orangutans in zoos to communicate with their semi-wild cousins,'Â  the researchers say.
