The last British man other than Andy Murray to win a Grand Slam singles match outside Wimbledon was to be found in Sheffield on Tuesday, playing at a humble Futures level event.

Dan Evans reached the third round of the 2013 US Open and looked like making the top 100. The 24-year-old made his comeback this week after a lengthy lay-off with knee problems, but lost his first round match on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, barring unexpected setbacks to her rehabilitation from wrist surgery, it looks increasingly likely that Laura Robson will start playing next month in some lower-tier events in America before returning to the main WTA Tour in March.

These were the kind of scraps of consolation being looked for at Melbourne Park on Monday as the weekend feelgood factor for British tennis was quickly cut away like a broken racket string at the Australian Open.

The relatively bumper representation of three players on the second day were all eliminated, although there was a strain of sorrow and misfortune running through their defeats.

Heather Watson, coming in from her weekend triumph in Hobart, was unwell and resolved to discuss with the doctor the sporadic onset of viral-type symptoms.

2005: The last time Britain had two men in the second round of the Australian Open — Tim Henman and Greg Rusedski. Both were knocked out before the fourth round.

James Ward gave a decent showing against Fernando Verdasco but could not win and is now flying home for the funeral of his grandmother, who passed away last week.

Kyle Edmund had done well to qualify but against America’s world No 38 Steve Johnson he was overmatched and went out in straight sets.

The results are a reminder that unearthing a critical mass of British players with international class remains an elusive thing.

Australian Bob Brett, brought in to try to invigorate the Lawn Tennis Association’s hapless attempts at producing the necessary quality, is here but he will have known the task already.

He might cast an envious eye on the situation of his home country, now coming up with a host of exciting prospects.

Heather Watson lost in the first round of the Australian Open after feeling unwell

Watson was the only player facing lower-ranked opposition but went down 6-4, 6-0 to Bulgaria’s Tsvetana Pironkova, calling on the trainer and doctor when 2-5 down.

She had felt unwell the previous day and talked of having sporadic viral-type symptoms.

Her 2013 season was wrecked by glandular fever, although she stated that she did not feel it was related to that. ‘I have one or two days when I feel like this.

'I’m going to see the doctor but I think it’s just the way my body works,’ she said. ‘It’s very frustrating, especially as this is one of those times I want all my energy. It sucks.’

Watson still plans to play in the doubles event before heading home to prepare to represent Great Britain in the Fed Cup early next month in Hungary.

After playing well for long spells in a 2-6, 6-0, 7-6, 6-3 defeat to a high-quality opponent in Verdasco Ward said he would be heading straight home to his family in Euston.

James Ward put in a good performance against Fernando Verdasco - but ultimately fell to defeat

‘My grandmother passed away five days ago. I’ve lived with her a lot and it’s been tough as we are a close family. I am going home for the funeral next week, at the moment that is the priority,’ he said.

‘I don’t know what I will do (tennis-wise) the next couple of weeks.’

On the court he showed how much he has improved in areas such as his speed and court coverage, but the golden rule in beating players of Verdasco’s calibre is to take your chances when they come. 

He led 4-2 in the third set and had a set point at 6-5 in the tiebreak, before the Spaniard stepped it up.

‘He produced at the big moments,’ reflected Ward correctly.

It is tempting to think that if the likes of Edmund, Ward, Liam Broady, Evans, Watson, Robson and Jo Konta were all fit and played to their potential (not to mention wannabe Brit Aljaz Bedene) then there might be the makings of a nucleus to support Murray.

But it is a very big ‘if’ indeed.
