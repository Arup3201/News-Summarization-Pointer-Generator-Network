HBO series True Detective is the TV phenomenon of the year.

And while Carrie Bradshaw and her Sex and the City girls embraced New York City as an extra character in their show, detectives Rustin 'Rust' Cohle and Marty Hart have an imposing - if slightly dangerous - version of Louisiana as their backdrop.

The southern American state is drenched in drama and history, and as the thrilling TV manhunt reveals a darker side to the sleepy Southern stretch travel fans are treated to a display of fascinating nature and architecture.

The sweeping landscape shots including bayou banks, lush fields and sprawling trees play a huge part in adding to the show's cinematic style. So taking inspiration from the hot show and its brooding stars we look at five ways to enjoy Louisiana (that don't involve serial killers, corduroy suits or CID squads).

TV talent: Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey star in True Detective, a crime series set in Louisiana

Drama: Matthew McConaughey plays 'Rust' Cohle and Woody Harrelson plays Marty Hart, two men trying to come to terms with themselves and each other

Drive the Creole country: There's a lot
 of car chat between the two 
detectives. There's also a lot of psychobabble from Cohle that we can't 
really understand but the scenery is so pretty that we don't mind. In 
their Drives of a Lifetime book the National Geographic recommends 
taking a trip along the Cane River Road, a 70mile loop thatÂ starts and ends in Natchitoches
 and is the perfect way to learn about the state's Creole culture, derived from 
French settlers and African slaves.

The 'Culinary Trails: Louisiana app' is also a brilliant way for foodies to explore the area by car, offering information on, and directions to, the best local restaurants from five-star eateries to mom-and-pop diners.

Grand: Old plantations are dotted throughout the countryside and many are now serving as tourist sites

Take a cocktail tour: Booze and 
bars feature heavily in the series and while we definitely wouldn't 
condone turning to the bottle with quite as much enthusiasm as Detective
 Cohle there's no denying that the people of Louisiana know how to enjoy
 a drink.

New Orleans is king when it comes to cocktails, holding the 
honour of inventing the drink in the form of the Sazerac, when local 
chemists mixed cognac with absinthe and bitters as a medicinal tonic.

The Gray Line company 
offers a cocktail-based walking tour of the city's pretty French Quarter
 that acts as a history tour with a twist, including tipples such as 
the Hurricane, the Mint Julep and the Gin Fizz.

Get woo'd with Voodoo: Dark magic is an underlying theme of the show, taking the form of twig people, 
cult fiction and a exploration of Mardi Gras.

Louisiana, and more 
specifically New Orleans, is the home of Voodoo practice in the U.S and 
'psychics' and tarot readers line the streets of the city ready to swap 
your money for their insight.

A more comprehensive way of learning about
 the African magic might be a visit to the quirky Voodoo Museum, whose 
owner's great-great-grandmother claimed to have been brought up with
 a Voodoo Queen (and if you can't make it all the way to Louisiana the 
museum offers handy telephone readings for just $40).

Bourbon Street: Voodoo, blues and booze rule in the French Quarter

The agents spend most of their time on location in the fields and swamps of the 'Pelican' state

Spooky: Abandoned houses and churches on the banks of the bayou feature throughout

Paddle the bayou: The 
slow-moving water of Louisiana is the perfect way to explore the area's 
distinctive landscape and some of the waterways of the state parks feature 
protected wildlife areas that feature families of fierce-looking alligators.

If 
rowing or paddling around reptiles isn't your idea of a good holiday then there are yacht charters galore, or a trip on one 
of the original Mississippi mud steamers is a more civilized way to 
watch Louisiana go by. Request an 
official travel guide from the Tourist Board at LouisianaTravel.com 
which features information on all of these options.

Wild waterways: Huge trees and alligator-infested rivers

Release your inner nature-lover at Pelican Island:
 In the show the remote Pelican Island is the setting for a rather 
terrifying cliff-hanger, in real life the island is just as remote, 
buried at the very Southern tip of the state, but you don't need to 
visit Pelican Island to see the birds in their natural habitat as they 
are all over the place.

Not
 a bird fan? Why not go and see the 'other' Pelicans on the basketball 
court at Smoothie King Center in New Orleans (see NBA.com for game 
details).
