When MailOnline launched a competition for one lucky mother to meet Enrique Iglesias, unsurprisingly, the entries came in thick and fast.

But one entry, sent in by Josephine Haydney's son Myron, really stood out so FEMAIL granted them the opportunity of a lifetime to meet the global superstar.

Myron, 16, explained what a huge fan his mother was in his entry: 'She has absolutely adored Enrique for the best part of 15 years (since I can remember).

Best day ever! Josephine Haydney and son Myron were granted the opportunity of a lifetime to meet global superstar Enrique Iglesias

'Literally, every single day mum listens to his albums for at least an hour, if not...2 or 3 hours.'

Myron went on to explain how his 7-year-old sister is severely disabled and relies on his parents for all of her personal care and needs. 

She suffers from a rare condition called Cask Gene Mutation, and when she received her diagnosis, she was only the seventh person diagnosed in the world.

Tragically for the family, last August, mum Josephine was diagnosed with breast cancer.

'Because of this, my family's whole world has turned upside down,' Myron told us.

'Mum hasn't been able to care for my sister like she used to because she hasn't had the strength to. She has had chemotherapy and she has been really sick and I feel helpless as there is nothing I can do to help her. 

Hero: Josephine had breast surgery a few days before the meet and greet, so, explained Myron, to meet Enrique a few days later (on Mother's Day) would be 'out of this world' for her - and it really was

'All I want is to see her smile again like she did on her last chemo session and if she met Enrique, I am sure it would give her the extra strength to carry on.' 

Josephine had breast surgery a few days before the meet and greet, so, explained Myron, to meet Enrique a few days later (on Mother's Day) would be 'out of this world' for her.

He added: 'It's not fair because my mum always puts other people before herself and she is just a complete inspiration to me.

'It's easy for me to say because she's my mum but I have never known anyone who is so caring and warm -hearted.

'I just think mum deserves this so much because Enrique is what gives mum strength at the moment, let alone if she actually met him.'

Myron and Josephine were whisked down to London from Cornwall for a luxurious night away and met the superstar.

Speaking after the event, Myron said: 'I wanted to give my mum something to smile about again.

'We had a fantastic time meeting Enrique. It's given my mum the inspiration to fight cancer and stay positive.'

A thrilled Josephine said: 'Winning the competition made me think that anything is possible.

'I never thought I would make a 6 hours journey from Cornwall to London just four days after my breast cancer surgery. It was the best Mother's Day present I could've ever wished for.'

AND JOSEPHINE AND MYRON WEREN'T THE ONLY TWO TO MEET ENRIQUE...FEMAIL WRITER DENI KIRKOVA MET THE SPANISH HEARTTHROB

His fortieth isn't too far off but Enrique Iglesias looks hotter than ever.

In an exclusive interview with FEMAIL the sexy Spaniard reveals the inspiration behind his new album, his top chat-up lines and his grooming secrets.

Enrique, 38, reveals he doesn't like too much hair and he personally depilates everywhere.

When asked about his top grooming tips for men, Enrique reveals he keeps his routine simple but thorough.

'If you have a hairy back, shave it; brush your teeth; fake tan I'm not so much into. Not too much hair I guess - I shave everywhere. I'm kidding, I don't shave everywhere... But most places you do try to trim.'

Enrique likes to keep things fragrant as well as tidy: he reveals he is coming out with a new fragrance for men called 
Adrenaline - a completely new venture for him.

'I never thought I would say this but I was pretty involved in it, I wear it myself and I like it.

'It
 has a woody kind of smell to it. I just went with my other favourites 
that I would wear in the past and combined them and said "This is the 
direction I want to take it in". It's going to come out towards the end 
of the year.'

Looking - and smelling - good is a priority for the star, who claims that since he's turned 30 keeping in shape hasn't been as easy.

Enrique Iglesias, pictured earlier this month, says he prefers performing to burn calories rather than the gym

'One of the things I've noticed, when 
you turn 30 and up, you've gotta watch a little bit more what you eat. 
But in my case going on tour, two hours on stage, you actually lose a 
lot of calories which is good. I notice when I'm not on tour I'm not in 
as good shape. It helps me like a workout.

'When it comes down to the gym or 
anything that's cardio, like running on the treadmill, I'm very lazy. 
What I like to do more is sports. Whether it's surfing or paying 
racquetball with my friends, you sweat a lot and I like that better.'

And talking of getting sweaty... we had to grill him about his chat-up lines.

'My
 lines tend to be kind of stupid and immature,' he says.

'If a girl can laugh at a 
joke then I always think that's cool. That's fun, it's a good opener.'

And when it comes to dating, he likes to prepare things in advance but doesn't like anything too loud or fancy.

'I like dinner and a movie, and places that are not very loud.'

'My lines tend to be kind of stupid and immature. If a girl can laugh at a joke then I always think that's cool'

The craving for simplicity is reflected in the title of his latest album, Sex and Love.

'Sex And Love is the first title I thought of when I listened to the album,' he says.

'A
 lot of times I thought, "maybe it's too simple, too straightforward", 
but every time I thought of a new title kept coming back to Sex & 
Love.

'It's something we can all relate to.'
