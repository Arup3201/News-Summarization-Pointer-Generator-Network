Good for you: Red wine has been proven to keep your cholesterol down

Yesterday’s blowout may have left you splayed on the sofa with a tum you fear will take January in the gym to work off.

But despite its button-bursting reputation, your Christmas dinner could actually have done you no end of good.

The meal takes some of our healthiest seasonally available foods and combines them with goodness-packed spices from the store cupboard.

In fact, what you eat at this time of year is a classic celebration of the best nutrition available in Britain’s darkest months.

Here, we reveal how Christmas foods will keep you hale and hearty long after the spinster aunts have gone home.

So raise a glass to the knowledge that enjoying them all in sensible moderation — or in moderate moderation at least (it is the season of goodwill, after all) — will keep you going through the bleak midwinter.

Turkey sharpens up your brain

Free-range turkeys are rich in protein
 and contain amino acids that support cell repair, according to 
nutritional studies. The dark meat is a good source of iron, and turkey 
is low in fat, too, if you don’t eat the skin.

Turkey
 contains the amino acid tryptophan, which produces mood-boosting 
serotonin and plays an important role in strengthening the immune 
system. The chemical also makes us less impulsive and improves our 
decision-making abilities.

Sprouts protect you against cancer

Sprouts contain cancer-fighting chemicals that protect our DNA against damage and may be effective against breast and colon cancer.

The International Journal of Urology found that the more sprouts men eat, the lower their risk of prostate cancer. They are an excellent source of immunity-boosting vitamin C and are high in vitamin A, which promotes supple skin.

Sprouts are loaded with folic acid, important if you’re planning to become pregnant, and are high in fibre.

They also protect against arthritis. Steam them to retain their anti-cancer chemicals; boiling diminishes them.

Meal of the year: Despite how you may feel today, your big Christmas dinner may be the healthiest meal you have had all year

Cranberries save your heart and gums

Cranberries
 are a source of antioxidants — substances that help neutralise free 
radicals, which are the by-products of metabolism in the body that can 
damage cell membranes and DNA.

A laboratory study found that cranberries can help to protect against cancer and heart attacks.

In
 tests, people who drank two glasses of cranberry juice a day reduced 
their levels of LDL (‘bad’) cholesterol. An experiment also discovered 
that women who drank the juice suffered fewer urinary infections such as
 cystitis.

Cranberry juice was also seen to reduce dangerous strains of bacteria in the women’s bodies.

Other studies have shown the juice to have anti-viral properties that may reduce the risk of gum disease and stomach ulcers.

Potatoes put your tum in tip-top shape

Carrots are excellent, not least for their eyesight-boosting beta carotene. They also have cancer-fighting properties. And, if you have them with a splodge of mayonnaise, their nutritional powers are strengthened.

Those humble-yet-tasty glazed parsnips also have anti-cancer properties — thanks to a group of chemicals called polyacetylenes that kill off leukaemia cells.

Then there are mashed and roast potatoes, which are a source of B vitamins and carbohydrates to keep your gut healthy.

Bloody good pud: The fruits and spices in your Christmas pudding help regulate the blood pressure and stabilises your blood sugar levels

Red wine controls your cholesterol

Every week there seems to be some new finding about the health-giving powers of red wine.

Principally,
 its antioxidant nutrients protect against heart disease. Moderate wine 
drinkers have higher levels of HDL, the so-called ‘good cholesterol’, 
says cardiologist Geoffrey Tofler.

His
 study of 3,000 people found that the blood platelets of people who 
drank three to six standard measures a week are much less likely to 
clump together in a way that could cause clotting.

Christmas pud is good for your joints

All the fruit in Christmas pudding offers a potassium-rich energy boost that helps to regulate blood pressure.

Meanwhile,
 spices bring a healthy balance to the mix. Cinnamon stabilises 
blood-sugar levels and softens the post-prandial crash big meals can 
cause.

Cinnamon may also 
reduce inflammation in joints. Arthritis patients given half a teaspoon 
of cinnamon powder with honey every morning suffered significantly less 
pain after one week.

Nutmeg 
oil has been used to treat stress, pain, menstrual cramps and 
indigestion. Studies have shown that nutmeg’s key component, isoeugenol,
 has very powerful antibacterial properties — particularly against germs
 in food.

Cloves contain 
eugenol and possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. 
Studies have found this ingredient can kill cancer cells in melanoma, 
leukaemia, and stomach tumours. They are also used in folk medicine to 
treat nausea and toothache.

On
 top of all this, scientists have found that nutmeg, cinnamon and cloves
 may all prompt our bodies to produce two groups of chemicals called 
allylbenzenes and propenylbenzenes. These give us an amphetamine-like 
energy buzz.

Clementines keep your skin healthy

Reach for the satsumas and clementines to fill up with fibre and get a rapid fix of vitamin C.

Just one satsuma can provide nearly half your daily allowance of vitamin C, which is not only good for your digestive health, but also for nails, hair and complexion.

Fruit fibre makes you feel fuller, quicker, so oranges can help you to stay within sight of your normal daily calorie consumption.

Walnuts help cut  the risk of stroke

Nuts contain a kind of omega-3 fatty acid called alpha linolenic acid (ALA). This has benefits for body and brain, helping us to deal better with stress.

A 2010 study showed the ALA in walnuts and walnut oil damp down the cardiovascular reactions that occur when we feel under pressure. Such heightened responses can put us at greater risk of heart attacks and strokes.

Other research has found that walnuts have high levels of  antioxidants — more than any other type of nuts. These  antioxidants are also particularly effective, protecting our brains and helping circulation.

Chocolates stop blood clots

Chocolates have proven to be another stress-reliever. Cardiologists have found that polyphenols in dark chocolate may help inhibit the formation of blood clots. So, come on . . . there’s still room for another choccie or two from granny’s selection box.
