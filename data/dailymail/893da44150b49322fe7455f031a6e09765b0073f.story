He's about to become a father for the first time, so perhaps Bill Clinton was imparting his own pearls of wisdom as he took a Sunday stroll with his son-in-law Marc and their dogs.

The former President and his investment banker son-in-law, who married Chelsea Clinton four years ago, were spotted on July 27 walking to a dog run in Madison Square Park, close to the young couple's $10.5million condo.

The father and son-in-law appeared relaxed in each other's company as they chatted, showing off their like-minded fashion sense of trainers, jeans and loose T-shirts.

Bonding time: Bill Clinton and his son-in-law Marc Mezvinsky took a stroll in Madison Square Park on July 27 with their dogs and the former President's Secret Service minders, who appeared to be subtly dressed for summer in suits and dark glasses

The former President and Chelsea's husband Marc hung out and chatted with their little dogs in the dog run on Madison Square Park in the Flatiron district 

Mr Mezvinsky, who is due to become a father for the first time, looked at ease in his powerful father-in-law's company, and appears to favor a similar dress sense

The pair went relatively unnoticed in the Sunday crowd of joggers and families but at one point Clinton stopped to shake hands with a cyclist

With their tiny dogs on leashes, the pair mostly blended in with the weekend crowd of joggers and stroller-pushers, despite Clinton's Secret Service detail trailing behind. At one point, Clinton stopped to shake a cyclist's hand.

The father-son team then relaxed by a fence but both kept their dogs on the leash. 

Chelsea Clinton, 34, announced she was pregnant with her first child in April and is due to give birth in the fall. 

At the time of the news, Bill Clinton, 67, tweeted: 'Excited to add a new line to my Twitter bio.. grandfather-to-be!'

The former first daughter was on a reported $600,000-a-year contract with NBC News earlier this year has now been moved to a month-to-month deal. She also continues to take an active role in Bill and Hillary's Clinton Foundation, regularly making speeches at events. 

Ms Clinton and husband Marc, 36, celebrated their fourth-wedding anniversary at the end of last month. 

They were married in a lavish inter-faith ceremony in Rhinebeck, New York on July 31, 2010.

Mr Mezvinsky is an investment banker at 3G Capital Management whose parents were both members of Congress for the Democrat party.

At the time of his daughter's engagement, Mr Clinton said of his future son-in-law: 'He's great. He's a great human being.'

Grandfather-to-be Mr Clinton looked at ease in the company of Chelsea's investment banker husband as they took a stroll close to Mr Mezvinsky's $10million condo 

Mr Clinton and his son-in-law spent time strolling around Madison Square Park in the Flatiron district of Manhattan on Tuesday

Mr Mezvinsky enjoyed a dog-walking outing with his dog Soren accompanied by his father-in-law Bill Clinton and his own dog 

Chelsea Clinton, pictured on July 25, announced that she was expecting her first baby in April. The 34-year-old  former first daughter is due in the fall
