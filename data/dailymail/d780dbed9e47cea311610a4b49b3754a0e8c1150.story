Colin Montgomerie was satisfied to mark his return to major championship golf with a highly respectable round of 70 in the US PGA Championship.

Montgomerie’s last appearance in a major came in this event in 2010, but the 51-year-old qualified by winning the senior version in May and outscored Tiger Woods by four shots thanks to a round containing three birdies and two bogeys.

'It’s great being back in a regular major and while winning is one thing, I wanted to represent the Champions Tour well and 70 is okay to start with,' the former Ryder Cup captain said. 

Back at a major: Colin Montgomerie was very satisfied with his performance

'I drove the ball well and knew if I did that I could get round.

'I can’t remember anything about being here in 2000. Hell, that was 14 years ago. What I can say is that the golf course is much, much longer. 

'I have gained about four per cent (in length) and the golf course 20 per cent so you’re very much shorter and I’m hitting longer shots into the greens.

'Also today the pin placements were very tight compared to the Champions Tour. 

'The greenkeeper here did quite well to actually find the green for some of the pins.'
