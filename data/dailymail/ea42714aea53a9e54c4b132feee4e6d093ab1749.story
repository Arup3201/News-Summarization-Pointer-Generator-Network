Gillian Weatherley - who was one of the officers present when Andrew Mitchell clashed with police in Downing Street sparking the 'Plebgate' scandal - gave evidence at Mr Mitchell's libel case today

A WPC at the centre of the Plebgate row who later claimed she could ‘topple the Tory government’ was yesterday accused of telling the High Court ‘a pack of lies’.

Gill Weatherley was the first police officer to stop MP Andrew Mitchell from cycling through the main gates that evening.

Her colleague PC Toby Rowland then intervened and claims the former chief whip called officers ‘f****** plebs’ when he was forced to use the pedestrian gate.

Two days later Miss Weatherley sent a sick friend a text saying: ‘This will make you feel better. I’m the officer that stopped the chief whip leaving Downing Street on Wednesday. He didn’t swear at me but [at] Toby that let him out the side gate. I could topple the Tory government.’

A month later the police marksman sent a text to her builder saying: ‘I’m at the front gates [of Downing Street] tomorrow so I still have time to bring the government down.’

She claims the messages were meant to be sarcastic.

Miss Weatherley was dismissed for gross misconduct in April after a Scotland Yard disciplinary panel examining the leaking of information found her to be a ‘thoroughly dishonest witness’.

Giving evidence at the Plebgate libel trial yesterday, she was accused of telling the ‘same pack of lies’ by James Price QC, representing Mr Mitchell. ‘The truth is that you were intent on doing some damage to Mr Mitchell and the Government, weren’t you?’ he said.

Miss Weatherley denied that was the case and said she did not even know who the MP was when she confronted him in Downing Street. She claimed she was ‘somewhat surprised and shocked’ when PC Rowland told her that Mr Mitchell had called the officers ‘f****** plebs’ who should know their place.

The following day Miss Weatherley sent a copy of PC Rowland’s account of the altercation to James Glanville, another officer in her squad.

PC Glanville was later sacked for passing a photograph of PC Rowland’s email to The Sun newspaper.

He had told her he wanted to read the email to see if the stories he had heard at work had been exaggerated, the court heard.

Miss Weatherley said PC Glanville told her he had deleted the email and she did not suspect him to be the source of the leak.

When she heard he had been arrested she told her chief superintendent what had happened.

The disgraced officer was also accused of speaking to PC Rowland on the phone for 22 minutes in the aftermath of the incident to ‘get their story straight’.

She said the conversation was simply a ‘sort of welfare’ chat because of the press attention the pair were receiving.

Mr Mitchell is suing News Group Newspapers, publishers of The Sun, over the allegation that he called officers ‘plebs’ during the altercation in September 2012.

Mr Mitchell denies using the word, but admits saying ‘I thought you guys were supposed to f****** help us’. News Group Newspapers argues its article was substantially true.

PC Rowland is suing the MP for suggesting that he made up the allegations. The case continues.
