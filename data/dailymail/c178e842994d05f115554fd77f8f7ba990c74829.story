Shots were fired by armed officers as police arrested a suspect in the middle of a busy road during rush hour.

Witnesses said they saw police in unmarked vehicles swoop on a Mercedes on the A27 in Lewes, East Sussex, as part of an operation led by London's Metropolitan Police.

The firearms officers discharged breaching, or Hatton rounds, at the tyres of a car, bringing it to a 'hard stop', before a man was seen being escorted away in handcuffs, close to a nearby roundabout.

Breaching rounds usually consist of metal powder contained in a wax canister and are also used by officers to blast open locks or hinges, as they disintegrate on impact and do not ricochet dangerously, like a bullet can.

The officers were part of the Trident Gang Crime Command, which works to tackle gang violence and investigates shooting incidents.

The man was arrested on suspicion of possessing a firearm, and was being questioned at a police station tonight.

A Metropolitan police spokesman dismissed online rumours that the arrest had been linked to terrorism, and said the claims were 'pure speculation'.

He said that
 armed officers had stopped the vehicle and rounds were discharged by 
officers, but that no injuries had been reported.

The spokesman also confirmed that a weapon had been found in the car.

'MPS detectives and armed officers from the MPS Specialist Firearms 
Command stopped the car at around 15:30hrs in relation to firearms,' he 
said.

The operation was led by officers from the Metropolitan Police, based in New Scotland Yard, London, who were part of Trident Gang Crime Command, which tackles gang violence

'No shots were fired during the stop but Hatton rounds where discharged to incapacitate the car.

'There were no reports of any injuries.

'A suspected firearm was recovered.

'Aman
 (no further details at this time) was arrested on suspicion of 
possession of a firearm and has been taken into custody at a local 
police station.'

The disruption caused chaos on the road, with commuters caught up in heavy delays as they tried to get home from work.

Following
 the incident, which took place at around 4.30pm, one lane of the dual 
carriageway's eastbound stretch was sealed off, with traffic backed up 
for around five miles.

One witness told the Brighton Argus: 'I came through minutes after the incident and this appears to be quite a large Police operation there are approx.

'Four or five un-marked police vehicles were involved and plain clothes police officers were in the road.

'They appear to have stopped or rammed a Mercedes car and handcuffed a very large gentleman at the side of the round.'

Drivers in East Sussex faced further traffic woes after a house fire in Rottingdean caused the closure of the A259 coast road.
