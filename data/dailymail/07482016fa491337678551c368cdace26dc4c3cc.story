David de Gea insists he will not be replaced by Victor Valdes as Manchester United’s first-choice goalkeeper.

Valdes is a free agent after leaving Barcelona at the end of last season and has been training with United as he continues to recover from the posterior cruciate ligament injury he suffered in March.

De Gea dislocated a finger while on international duty with Spain and is a doubt to face Arsenal on Saturday but the 24-year-old maintains his position as No 1 is not under threat.

'Yes, my contract runs out in 2016 but they didn’t sign him for that. Victor had a difficult injury, he had a bad time and the boss (Louis van Gaal) knows him well and has given him the opportunity to recover there,' De Gea told AS.

'Victor is training over in Manchester; he’s still not 100 per cent after his injury. When he is fully fit he will start to train with us. He’s still not training in goal with us. From time to time he comes out with the goalkeeping coach but very little still.

'Van Gaal knows him well because he gave Victor his debut at Barca and has a special affection for him and whenever possible we have to help where we can.

'Football is cruel at times, it’s difficult. When things go well, you’re very good and, when they go badly ... well, it’s awful.'

United play Blackpool in a behind-closed-doors game at Carrington on Tuesday. Blackpool are looking to include former United winger Chris Eagles and Manchester City midfielder George Evans who is joining on loan.
