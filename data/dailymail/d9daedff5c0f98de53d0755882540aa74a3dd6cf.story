SAS soldier Sgt Danny Nightingale has been jailed for possessing a 'war trophy' pistol presented to him by the Iraqi Army for outstanding service

The SAS sniper jailed for keeping a pistol as a war trophy said yesterday that he was ‘overwhelmed’ by the support he was receiving from the public.

Sergeant Danny Nightingale, 37, spoke out as his family and legal team took the first step to challenge his conviction and 18-month sentence at a Court of Appeal hearing in London next Thursday.

The development came as Defence Secretary Philip Hammond took an extraordinary swipe at Attorney General Dominic Grieve for failing to intervene in the case, claiming lawyers get ‘tremendously pompous’.

Campaigners believe the non-commissioned officer, who has served with valour in Iraq and Afghanistan, should never have been brought to trial.

In a statement last night, father-of-two Sgt Nightingale, from Crewe, Cheshire, said: ‘I have been trained to prepare for the worst so cannot allow myself to get optimistic about how things may unfold.

‘I remain overwhelmed by the public support. I’ve written thank you notes to over 200 people who have sent letters to me.

'I obviously want to be back with my family as soon as possible but I realise this is a matter for the court.’

His wife Sally, 38, said she hoped he
might be freed from custody at the Military Corrective Training Centre 
in Colchester, Essex, before Christmas.

‘I can’t explain how amazing this 
is,’ she said. ‘All along it’s been the worst case scenario and now it’s
the best case scenario. I’m hopeful now we will get him home for 
Christmas.’

Mr Hammond launched a broadside after
Mr Grieve, the Government’s top lawyer, refused a call from Mr Hammond 
to study whether prosecuting Sgt Nightingale had been in the public 
interest.

Mr Grieve, who sparked a Cabinet row 
by rejecting the request, said it would be inappropriate for ministers 
to intervene in the judicial process.

In what was seen as a fresh slap-down
to Mr Grieve, Mr Hammond said lawyers ‘get tremendously pompous about 
protecting the legal system’.

He told BBC2’s Daily Politics: ‘I had
hoped that I would get some reassurance one way or another about this, 
but I understand the Attorney General has responsibilities within the 
judicial process and he obviously has to take them very seriously.’

Sgt Nightingale, who has served in 
the Forces for 17 years, was given 18 months in military detention after
admitting owning a 9mm Glock pistol and 400 rounds of ammunition.

The weapon was a gift from a group of
Iraqis he helped train. He left it behind in Iraq, but it was then put 
in a container and sent to SAS headquarters in Britain and then to his 
home.

Sgt Nightingale had planned to pass 
the gun to his SAS regiment as a trophy but claimed he forgot he had it 
after suffering brain damage which affected his memory during a charity 
trek in Brazil.

His lawyers and family say he was bullied into pleading 
guilty on the grounds that he would be put in a civilian jail for up to 
five years.

Sgt Nightingale's wife Sally Nightingale wrote to David Cameron urging him to meet her to discuss the case

A former British Army officer has admitted bringing an illegal weapon into the country in the 1970s.

Bob Stewart, now a Tory MP, was a United Nations commander in Bosnia.

He said it was 'wrong' that Sgt Nightingale had been jailed and branded the law an 'ass' for imprisoning him.

Mr
Stewart, who retired from the Army in 1996, told Victoria Derbyshire on
BBC Radio 5 Live he was given a rifle in Londonderry in 1970 by a 
captain in the “B-Specials” - the Ulster Special Constabulary - who was 
decommissioning an armoury.

He put the weapon in his armoury in Ebrington Barracks in Londonderry, he said.

After around six months he decided he did not want to be accused of doing anything wrong and resolved to 'spike it'.

'Spiking a weapon is fundamentally making the barrel unusable, which is what we did by pouring lead down the centre of it.

'It
was clearly an IRA weapon from some stage between 1904 when it was made
and 1970 when I found it. I had no ammunition for it.'
