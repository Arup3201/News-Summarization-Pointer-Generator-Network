Investigators used a GPS device that was in a New Jersey man's vehicle to find the body of his wife, who had been missing since New Year's Eve, along the side of a rural road in Maryland, a New Jersey prosecutor said Wednesday.

The body of Erica Crippen, 26, was found under branches and brush in Sykesville, Maryland, on Tuesday; she was wrapped in a blanket; her arms, legs and neck were bound with an electrical cord and duct tape was on her face and nose, Burlington County Prosecutor Robert Bernardi said.

Crippen's husband, Kyle Crosby, 28, was charged in January with murder in his wife's death. He remained in jail Wednesday. Court and jail records didn't list a lawyer for him.

Bernardi said that after Crosby's arrest, investigators found a GPS device in his Ford Taurus that contained 8,500 points, or what the prosecutor characterized as 'bread crumbs' that showed where the vehicle had stopped.

Crippen's body was found less than 100 feet from one of the points, Bernardi said.

It's unclear how or when Crippen died but authorities believe Crosby dumped her body either on the evening of January 10 or morning of January 11, Bernardi said. 

An autopsy was scheduled in Baltimore.

Investigators searched three times in Maryland for her body, but their efforts were hampered by the brutal winter, the prosecutor said.

The couple lived in Mount Laurel with their infant daughter and Crippen's seven-year-old daughter from a prior relationship.

Crippen's body was found the same week Crosby's 67-year-old mother, Jo, was charged in the case with hindering and tampering with physical evidence.

Authorities allege Jo Crosby deleted several text messages from her phone sent to her son the morning police believe he killed his wife.

According to an affidavit, at least 15 text messages between her and her son on New Year's Eve were retrieved during a forensic examination of their cellphones. 

The two also had an 18-minute phone conversation, according to an affidavit obtained by The Associated Press through an open records request. 

Murder: The Mount Laurel woman had an electrical cord around her neck and duct tape binding her hands and feet; the cold weather preserved the body, police said

Jo Crosby eventually admitted deleting the messages when she learned authorities were coming to interview her, the affidavit said.

She has been released on $12,500 bail. 

It wasn't clear Wednesday if she had an attorney who could comment on the charges. 

A phone number could not be found for her.

Crosby told Crippen's family he didn't know where his wife was the day after she went missing, however he didn't report it to police.

Authorities only found out a week later when they went to the couple's home to check on Crippen's seven-year-old daughter, who had not attended school for the week.

After being questioned, Crosby went missing.

One week later he was arrested and charged with murder.

Investigators said they found several items that had 'evidential value in connection to (Crippen's) disappearance' in the trunk of the vehicle.

Following the arrest, Crippen's family spoke out about Crosby, saying he had been on a drug binge with a prostitute following his wife's disappearance.

They said he sold some of her clothes in order to pay for the drugs.
