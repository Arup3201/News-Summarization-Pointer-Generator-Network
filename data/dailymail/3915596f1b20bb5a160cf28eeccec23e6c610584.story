A state agency in Minnesota is claiming the world record for largest ball of paper.

The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency says the ball measures 9 feet 7 inches tall and 32.2 feet in circumference. 

The 426-pound ball was displayed at the Minnesota State Fair to show how much recyclable paper state residents throw away every 30 seconds.

The agency that made the ball recycled it, turning it into cardboard for cereal boxes

But anyone who missed seeing the ball at the fair is out of luck: The agency recycled it, turning it into cardboard for cereal boxes.

Spokeswoman Taylor Holland said Monday that the agency got confirmation last week from Guinness World Records.

There wasn't a previous record. But in keeping with Guinness guidelines, no adhesives or tape was used. 

The ball was built around a cardboard frame and held together with paper netting.
