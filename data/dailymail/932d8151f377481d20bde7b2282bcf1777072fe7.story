Half of all cancer cases are spotted at a late stage when treatment is less likely to be successful, experts have warned.

They calculate that more than 52,000 patients a year are having their odds of survival cut because the disease is not being caught quickly enough.

The shocking figure is based on huge variations in diagnosis around England, with some cancers almost five times as likely to be diagnosed late in some parts of the country as others.

Lung cancer is the most likely to be spotted late – with fewer than one in four cases caught early.

Late diagnosis is blamed on factors from a ‘stiff upper lip’ to GPs under pressure not to refer patients for costly tests.

Cancer Research UK, which commissioned the analysis of NHS data, said that early diagnosis is ‘crucial to give patients the best chance of survival’.

Delays in treatment can not only be deadly, but can also mean patients are subjected to much more aggressive treatments than would have been necessary earlier in the disease’s progress.

For instance, a woman with breast cancer might only have surgery if the tumour is spotted early. But if the disease has spread, she may face rounds of gruelling chemotherapy and radiotherapy as well. Overall, 46 per cent of cancer in England are diagnosed at an advanced stage – when they have spread to other parts of the body, making them harder to treat.

The figure rises to 77 per cent for lung cancer, Britain’s biggest cancer killer. When it is diagnosed early, seven in ten patients will live at least a year – compared to around one in four when found late.

Cancer Research UK’s chief executive Harpal Kumar said: ‘Not to invest in earlier diagnosis is to fail cancer patients'

If every part of the country did as well as the best, the ‘survival prospects’ of more than 52,000 patients a year would be improved, the Incisive Health report estimates.

This does not mean all would be cured – some would simply live longer or be spared gruelling treatments. But 5,000 more patients would be alive five years after diagnosis. The added cost of treating advanced cancer means that catching the disease early would also save the NHS an estimated £210million a year.

Cancer Research UK’s chief executive Harpal Kumar said: ‘Not to invest in earlier diagnosis is to fail cancer patients.

‘Earlier diagnosis saves lives and it could save critical NHS funds - and in the face of an overstretched NHS and a projected growing number of cancers diagnosed in the years ahead, we need to do everything we can to ensure that all patients have access to the best treatment as early as possible.’

NHS England said it is working to improve outcomes for patients though earlier diagnosis.

It added that survival rates have ‘never been higher’.
