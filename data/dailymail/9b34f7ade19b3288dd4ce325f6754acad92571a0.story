Scientists have bottled the Earth’s most colourful light show, along with several auroras from other planets.

The colours were created inside a glass dome known as a Planeterrella where charged particles glow vividly when exposed to a magnetic field.

This is similar process to that which creates the Northern Lights and will help scientists better understand how different auroras are formed.

Dr Guillaume Gronoff and 
his intern Sam Walker from Letourneau University in Texas, built the 
Planeterrella at the Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia.

‘It recreates the atmosphere of the Earth at 80km in altitude when an aurora is occurring,' said Dr Gronoff, a research scientist at Nasa Langley.

'The aurora is created when particles, originally from the sun, precipitate into the atmosphere.'

The Planeterrella machine is a spinoff of an experiment from the 19th century called the Terrella.

The Terrella, created by Norwegian physicist Kristian Birkeland, first demonstrated the glowing result of electrically charged particles mixing with a magnetic field.

From, 1896 to 1917 the Norwegian physicist Kristian Birkeland designed an
experiment called the Terrella, to better understand the formation of the polar lights.

The experiment consisted of shooting electrons from a duct to a magnetised sphere in a vacuum. The electron gun represented the sun, and the magnetised sphere represented the Earth.

A century later, new designs of the experiment have branched out to simulate different interactions between different stars and their planets, hence the new name, 'Planeterrella'.

Dr Gronoff and his team upgraded the old experiment by adding several spheres, which allowed them to recreate the auroral ovals that occur on Earth and several other planets.

‘For example, we can show the reaction when Io, the satellite of Jupiter, sends particles to Jupiter. We can also simulate the aurora at Neptune and Uranus, when their magnetic fields are directly pointing towards the sun,’ said Dr Gronoff.

There are around 10 other Planeterrella machines in Europe, and the first was created by Dr Gronoff’s PhD advisor, Dr Jean Lilensten, in France.

Studying auroras and the relationship between the sun and the Earth is a key focus area of Nasa’s Science Mission Directorate. The Planeterrella machine will used for demonstrating how each variable interacts to create an aurora.

The colour of the aurora in the bottle is purple because of the nitrogen used. The aurora on Earth is usually green due to reactions with oxygen in the atmosphere

‘The Planeterrella allows us to create analogies with existing processes, like the aurora at Mars, which do not have a global magnetic field, but several localised magnetic fields, or Uranus and Neptune, when the magnetic fields of those planets point towards the Sun,’ explained Dr Gronoff.

Dr Gronoff warned that the experiment is only an illustration; more complex phenomena are occurring in the magnetospheres of planets.

For example, there are various gases on each planet that can create different colour effects within auroras.

Dr Gronoff is now planning on incorporating this variable using a few extra magnets and some carbon dioxide to simulate the aurora on Mars.
