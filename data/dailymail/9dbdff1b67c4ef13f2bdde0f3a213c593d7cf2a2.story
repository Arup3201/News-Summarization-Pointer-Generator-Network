Stay back because they bite!

After a number of reports of seals sighting on beacheson the South-West coast of Australia, the Department of Parks and Wildlife has released a statement to remind people not to approach the large animals.

Wildlife officer Cameron Craigie said it was common for species including the leopard seal,sub-Antarctic fur seal and New Zealand fur seal to come ashore during winter fronts.

'These seals haul up on beaches to rest – they are not ‘stranded’ and don’t require assistance from people,' Mr Craigie said.

If you spot a seal or a sea lion sun baking on a beach do not approach it or you may be bitten

Mr Craigie said some seals seen on metropolitan beaches recently were juveniles or sub-adults with poor body condition.

'Human intervention with these animals causes a high level of stress, which may result in a further deterioration of their health and even cause death,' he said.

'In the majority of cases, the best thing for the seal is to be left undisturbed.'

People may also notice seals and sea lions spinning or twisting around in the water and sticking their flippers in the air.

'This is a natural behaviour known as thermo-regulating where by the seal is controlling its body temperature by exposing different parts to the sun and sticking flippers in and out of the water,' Mr Craigie said.

If people see a seal with obvious body injuries they can report it to the department’s Wildcare Helpline on 9474 9055.
