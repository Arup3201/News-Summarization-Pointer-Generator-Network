The son of Lord Lucan has, for the first time, spoken about the horrific aftermath of his nanny's murder as police led him and his young sisters from a scene of 'terrible carnage'.

George Bingham, who was just seven years old when his nanny Sandra Rivett was bludgeoned to death, described how officers guided the three children through the house in total darkness to shield them from seeing the blood-soaked walls.

In an interview, Bingham - now aged 45 - has recalled how, on the night of the brutal attack on November 7, 1974, he was woken from a deep sleep by a policeman standing over his bed and then taken out of the house in London.

thinks may have happened to him

Sandra Rivett, nanny to Lord Lucan's children, was found dead in Belgravia, London, in November 1974

The youngsters had no idea that their nanny Sandra was dead and their mother had been seriously injured. Their father, Lord Lucan, had disappeared from the scene, presumed guilty of the attacks.

Bingham and his sisters were cared for by relatives in the wake of the murder as the full scale of the horror emerged.

In an interview with the Sunday MIrror, Bingham described how the memories of that night were still 'crystal clear' in his mind but that he rarely revisited it in his head.

The 29-year-old nanny had been looking 
after George, his older sister Frances, then aged 10, and four-year-old 
Camilla - the youngest of the siblings - for six months

He recalls how the evening had begun as it always did - with Sandra tucking him up in bed with a cup of cocoa and blowing him a kiss, saying goodnight with her 'usual smile' before turning out the lights.

This was his last memory of his 
beloved nanny. Within an hour she had been bludgeoned to death, his 
mother Veronica seriously injured and his father had vanished.

Bingham had been in a deep sleep and 
had heard nothing of the incident. The first he knew something was wrong
 was when he was woken by a policeman standing by his bed, telling him 
to get dressed and leave the house.

Officers turned off all the lights in
 the house before guiding the children out, in a bid to hide the horror 
of the blood-splattered crime scene from them.

He told the Sunday Mirror: 'The 
officers turned off the lights in the hallway where there was blood on 
the walls and some terrible scenes of carnage.

'There was so much blood and they didn’t want us to see it.'

Detective believed Lucan killed Sandra by mistake in the dark, that his intended target had been his estranged wife. The couple were in the middle of acrimonious divorce proceedings.

They also believed that he attacked Veronica when she disturbed her husband, before he fled the scene.

Bingham added: 'I remember the police officers being very tense but trying to be very friendly.

'There were several policemen, and a 
­couple of plain-clothes officers. My ­sisters and I were gathered up 
and driven by a police car to my ­grandmother’s around the corner in St 
John’s Wood, where we stayed most of the night. I got plonked on the 
sofa and just went to sleep.

'We weren’t told exactly what had 
happened but we were finger-printed at some stage. Even us, despite the 
fact we were children.'

They were reunited with their mother a week after the attack and the family went to stay with relatives.

However, it was to be a whole nine 
months after the incident that the children were finally told that their
 father and nanny would not be coming home.

The police named Lucan as the prime 
suspect, but were unable to locate him, instead only finding a 
blood-stained car he was seen driving, abandoned at Newhaven, east 
Sussex.

A coroner, in the absence of the prime suspect, declared in 1975 that Lucan had indeed killed the pretty nanny.

But
 Lucan's son said he was certain that his father was not the 'prime 
mover' in the situation. He added that he hoped he was partly culpable 
because it would make his abscondment easier to cope with.

Bingham
 believes that his father would not have absconded, leaving his children
 (which included sisters Camilla and Frances) behind without real 
reason.

And that's why he hopes his father did have some part to play in that tragic night's events.

The graphic nature of the killing and in particular the amount of blood that was found at the scene, leads Bingham to suspect that one or more parties were involved in the murder, yet he does not entirely discount his father being one of them.

He does, however, disagree with the version of events according to his mother, with whom he no longer has contact with, believing that the state of her relationship with Lucan at the time clouded her details of fact.

Lucan left two letters behind addressed to his brother in law William Shand Kydd, written on the night of the murder.

In these letters the tone is clear that he was not to return, giving details of his banking details and estate.

The second letter, in particular, is most interesting.

In it, he refers to a 'fight' he broke up at the property, and that a man left following the assaults.

However,
 speaking with a worry for the welfare for his children, Lucan appears 
adamant that 'V' (Veronica) would make things difficult for him, and 
that he couldn't face being charged with attempted murder.

Bingham
 hopes his no-hold-barred account of that horror night can put to bed 
many rumours that came out at the time, and are still prevalent today.

Some say Lucan mistakenly killed Rivett instead of his wife, as the lighting was poor in the house at the time.

Others say he hired a hitman to do his dirty work, and then escaped to Kenya with the help of some of his high-powered friends.

An assistant of zoo owner John Aspinall revealed this year that she booked flights for Lucan's children in 1979 and 1980 to visit a reserve in Kenya - but in reality it was for Lucan to see how his children had grown up.

The children lived with their mother until 1982 until all custody was transferred to their aunt and uncle, Lucan's sister Christina and her husband William Shand Kydd, the recipient of Lucan's letters.
