President Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin publicly ignored each other today as they stood just feet apart during a for state leaders' commemorating the 70th anniversary of D-Day.

World figures met in France in the midst of a current geopolitical crisis, with Putin standing alongside leaders, including Obama, who are against his aggressive moves into Ukraine.

All eyes were on Putin and Obama as they refused to acknowledge each other at the group photograph before keeping their distance as they headed to lunch at the Chateau de Benouville.

But as 
speculation mounted over whether or not they would talk, the White 
House confirmed that the pair did indeed speak 'for 10 to 15 minutes' 
once they went inside for the luncheon.

'President
 Obama and President Putin did speak with each other on the margins of 
the leaders lunch,' his assistant Ben Rhodes said. 'It was an informal 
conversation - not a formal bilateral meeting.'

A video of the interaction, captured by the French government, shows the men initially smiling with each other before the conversation apparently turns more serious.

On Friday afternoon, a White House official released a readout of the 15-minute conversation, saying Obama warned Putin that 'de-escalation' of sanctions against Russia 'depends upon Russia recognizing President-elect Poroshenko as the legitimate leader of Ukraine, ceasing support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, and stopping the provision of arms and materiel across the border'.

Obama, the readout continued, 'noted President-elect Poroshenko's commitment to pursue reforms to ensure that the rights and interests of all Ukrainians are respected, and urged Russia to work immediately with the government in Kiev to reduce tensions.'

'President Obama made clear that a failure to take these steps would only deepen Russia's isolation.'

Putin
 spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the leaders had exchanged views about the 
situation in Ukraine and the crisis in the east, where Ukrainian forces 
have been fighting with pro-Russian insurgents.

Is that a smile? Putin and Obama were captured on video during their conversation at the lunch on Friday and both men smile as they begin talking - despite giving each other the cold shoulder just minutes earlier

'Putin and Obama spoke for the need to end violence and fighting as quickly as possible,' he said.

The
 leaders had been placed just seats from each other - with only Queen 
Elizabeth II, French President Francois Hollande and Queen Margrethe of 
Denmark separating them.

The pair had not previously met about the crisis, although they have spoken multiple times by phone.

During the photo, Obama and Putin went to great pains not to speak to each other.

'Obama and Putin were at times close 
enough to touch but did not speak with or acknowledge each other in the 
pool's presence,' the White House pool reporter noted.

Within touching distance: The pool reporter noted that Obama could have easily tapped on Putin's shoulder as he walked towards the lunch with Queen Elizabeth but he avoided the interaction

As
 Putin hovered nearby, the president 'made a point of jovially greeting 
other leaders, kissing Merkel on both cheeks, but he and Putin seemed to
 go out of their way not to encounter each other'.

The men 
were also pictured walking within feet of each other as they headed to 
the chateau - with Obama accompanying the Queen just a few steps behind.

Obama
 'could have tapped him on the shoulder if he wanted to but instead 
focused his attention elsewhere as if not noticing who was there', the 
pool reporter noted.

Obama told
 reporters on Thursday that if he and Putin did speak, he would tell him
 that he has a new path to engage with Ukraine through President-elect 
Petro Poroshenko, who takes office Saturday.Â 

At odds: Only the Queen, France's Francois Hollande and Denmark's Queen Margrethe separated Obama and Putin at the lunch on Friday. The men did speak for 10 to 15 minutes, the White House said

'If
 he does not, if he continues a strategy of undermining the sovereignty 
of Ukraine, then we have no choice but to respond' with more sanctions, 
Obama said.

Putin
 and Poroshenko were pictured meeting at the event in France on Friday -
 their first meeting since Poroshenko was elected last month.

They were pictured speaking briefly with Germany's Angela Merkel following the leaders' photograph.

Reporters couldn't hear 
any of the animated minute-long conversation. No plans have been 
announced for a formal meeting between the men.

Obama said on Thursday that he hoped the Russian leader would be 'moving in a new direction' on Ukraine since 
he didn't immediately denounce Poroshenko's election - 'but I 
think we have to see what he does and not what he says'.

French 
officials reportedly went to elaborate lengths to keep Obama and Putin 
apart in Paris, at Washington's request, before the D-Day events.

On
 Thursday, French President Francois Hollande held separate dinners with
 the U.S. and Russian leaders in an attempt to unlock Europe's worst 
security crisis since the Cold War.

'This
 is an important occasion to express gratitude and fraternity, but it is
 also major international event which should serve the interests of 
peace,' Hollande told a news conference after a summit of G7 leaders in 
Brussels - a meeting to which Putin was pointedly not invited.
