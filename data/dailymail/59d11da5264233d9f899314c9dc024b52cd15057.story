The body of a woman found in a wooded area on Long Island Thursday has been identified as missing mom Sarah Goode, sources say.

Her body was found on Thursday evening, nearly a week after the mother of a 4-year-old girl, vanished.

Her partially decomposed body was discovered at about 6 p.m. and the medical examiner confirmed her identify on Friday lunchtime.

Found? Police have found a body in woodland they believe might be Long Island medical technician, Sarah Goode. Her car was found, empty and near the woods, shortly after her family reported her missing last week

Police are thoroughly searching the woods near where Goode's car was found but they have found nothing as of yet

Ms Goode, 21, is thought to have gone missing under 'suspicious circumstances,' last Friday night after she went to work and then out with friends.

Police found Goode's 1999 BMW parked a mile away from her house on Fire Avenue near new London Avenue in Medford.

Police say the car showed obvious signs of a struggle and a witness said that there appeared to be blood in the vehicle.

Suffolk police say they received a call shortly after 6 p.m. from a member of a search party organized by Goode's family reporting a body in the woods off Camden Court in Medford.

Detectives found her body within a mile of where Goode's car was found earlier this week, about a mile from her home.

Family and friends had been leading the search for Goode and called the situation a 'nightmare.'

'I feel horrible for them and her 4-year-old daughter,' said family member Joseph Miller to PIX11.  'She loved her daughter so much, I know that.'

Goode who works as a medical technician and who is the mother of a four-year-old lives in Suffolk with her mother and her daughter.

NBC reports that a woman who lived a mile away  on the street where the car was found noticed that the license plate was bent and that the numbers were obscured. Thinking the car might have been stolen, she reported it to police.

'Your baby girl can¿t wait to give you that great big hug when you come home. We just want you to come home safely,' Goode's sister Elizabeth DeMuria (pictured) said tearfully

'This
 is a 21-year-old lady. She has a 4-year-old daughter, a very close 
family — and the circumstances, as I’ve explained, are suspicious to 
us,' said Suffolk County police Detective Sgt. Michael Fitzharris.

'Your
 baby girl can’t wait to give you that great big hug when you come home.
 We just want you to come home safely,' Goode's sister Elizabeth DeMuria
 said tearfully.

'Please, if anybody knows anything, please let somebody know,' she added.

Goode recently broke up with her boyfriend but police don't have any suspects nor have they chosen a person of interest.

Goode's friends and family say she has no drug or alcohol problems and they describe her as 'gracious, outgoing, and caring.'

Anyone with information regarding Goode's disappearance is asked to call Suffolk County Crime Stoppers at (800) 220-TIPS.
