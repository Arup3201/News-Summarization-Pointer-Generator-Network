Mario Balotelli might have failed to light up AC Milan's friendly with Manchester City, but as usual he was never too far from the spotlight.

While his side went down 5-1 to his former club, the controversial Italian forward was accosted by two pitch invaders late in the game - and even let them snap a selfie with him.

It wasn't long before security were on the scene to pull the two frizzy-haired miscreants away, but Super Mario still obliged for a quick picture with a cheeky smile in Pittsburgh.

At least the 23-year-old wasn't among the most miserable performers for Milan.

He came on as a half time substitute with the Rossoneri already 4-1 down courtesy of Stevan Jovetic, Scott Sinclair, Jesus Navas and Kelechi Iheanacho, with Sulley Muntari scoring a consolation goal for Milan.

Jovetic added a second after the break as he outshone Balotelli - although he has had more pre season time after not appearing at the World Cup.

But Balotelli's former team mate Micah Richards was still happy to see him, posing for another selfie before the game - at least Richards was allowed on the pitch, despite his minimal game time with City.
