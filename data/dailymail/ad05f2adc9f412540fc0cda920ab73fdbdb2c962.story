For the ‘Sand Flea’ robot, clearly, the only way is up.

This is a tiny four-wheeled surveillance machine with an amazing trick up its sleeve – it can spring an incredible 30-feet into the air.

Footage of Sand Flea performing its circus tricks has been uploaded onto YouTube by its manufacturer, U.S robotics firm Boston Dynamics.

Petman can do squat thrusts, star jumps and even press-ups - and can even 'sweat' by releasing heat and fluid into garments. He is used to test chemical warfare gear so that the fabric won't rip

At first the clip seems unremarkable as Sand Flea trundles along on its small plastic white wheels.

But then it comes to a halt as it’s confronted by a large garage wall – and the fun begins.

Sand Flea’s front wheels rise up and a piston shoots it into the air on to the roof of the garage.

Boston Dynamics says: ‘An onboard stabilisation system keeps it oriented during flight to improve the view from the video uplink and to control landings. Current development of Sand Flea is funded by the U.S Army's Rapid Equipping Force.’

According to CNET nine Sand Fleas are being sent by the Army to Afghanistan for more rigorous testing.

The clever machine is one of several ground-breaking robots developed by Boston Dynamics.

It has also made ‘Petman’, which it claims is the first human-shaped, human-sized robot that walks like a man. It can hit speeds of 4.4mph.

The robot has been designed to act as a walking mannequin to ensure soldiers' chemical warfare suits don't rip.

There is also a prototype for a robotic battlefield 'pack mule' called Alphadog.

The mechanical quadruped - which bears a passing resemblance to the At-At walkers from the Star Wars films - has a series of improvements on its predecessor which will leave the Big Dog cowering in its kennel.

And recently the firm broke the record for legged machines with Cheetah.

It resembles the cat-like Decepticon Ravage, seen in the Transformers 2 movie, and in tests recently the speedy machine managed to run at 18mph, which means it would be able to outrun most humans.
