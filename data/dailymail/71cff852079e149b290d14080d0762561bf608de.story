Hackers posted a picture of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un portrayed as a pig on the country's official flickr account today.

The account and the official Uriminzokkiri Twitter account were apparently hacked today as tensions in the Korean Peninsula continued to rise.

The North’s Uriminzokkiri Twitter and 
Flickr accounts stopped sending out content typical of that posted by 
the regime in Pyongyang, such as photos of North’s leader Kim Jong Un 
meeting with military officials.

This picture of Kim Jong Un as a pig appeared on the official Flickr page after activists hacked the account

Instead, a picture posted today showed Kim’s face with a pig-like snout and a drawing of Mickey Mouse on his chest.

Underneath, text read: 'Threatening world peace with ICBMs and Nuclear weapons/Wasting money 
while his people starve to death.'

The mocked-up Wanted poster included a $1million 'bounty' placed on Kim and accusations of 'human rights violations'.

Another posting says 'We are Anonymous' in white letters against a black background.

Anonymous is a name of a hacker 
activist group. A statement purporting to come from the attackers and 
widely circulated online said that they had compromised 15,000 user 
records hosted on Uriminzokkiri.com and other websites.

The images have since been taken down but the Twitter account stills appears to be hacked.

Tweets on the North’s Twitter account 
said 'Hacked' followed by a link to North Korea-related websites. One 
tweet said 'Tango Down' followed by a link to the North’s Flickr page.

North Korea opened its Twitter account
 in 2010. It has more than 13,000 followers. The North uses the social 
media to praise its system and leaders and also to repeat commentaries 
sent out by North’s official Korean Central News Agency.

Anonymous have previously been accused of a number of planned cyber-attacks government websites across the world.

One of their biggest coups was to secretly record a conference call between U.S. and British cyber investigators tasked with bringing the group to justice.

Kim Jong Un has been ratcheting up tensions on the Korean Peninsula in recent days.

North Korea warned today that 'the moment of explosion is near' as it declared that troops have  been cleared to 
attack the U.S. using 'smaller, lighter and diversified' nuclear 
weapons.

The rogue state 
has moved a missile with a range of 3,000km (1,800m) to its east coast -
 within range of Japan - and claimed it would be ‘merciless’ against its
 enemies.

Kim Jong 
Un’s dramatic deployment came after the U.S. announced it was sending 
ballistic missile defences to Guam - the tiny Pacific Island on a list 
of possible targets for attack including Hawaii.
