Research by mySupermarket has shown that special offers on wine can be misleading, with some bottles sold for cheaper just months before

They are the offers designed to turn shoppers’ heads – wine at marked ‘half-price’ or ‘two  for £10’.

But research appears to confirm what many have long suspected: The bargains are often not what they seem.

Six in ten bottles sold by the big supermarkets are wines on promotion. But stores frequently put up prices in the weeks before a wine goes on offer to make discounts seem artificially big, says price comparison website mySupermarket.

The ‘yo-yo’ pricing can be so varied that Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Asda have sold brands at a lower price when they were not on offer.

Critics say shoppers need to be wiser to retailers’ pricing ploys but add that the public is partly to blame for allowing its buying habits to be driven by special offers.

Among the wines singled out is Tesco’s Ogio Pinot Grigio, on sale yesterday at £5.49, billed as half price, reduced from £10.99.

According mySupermarket, Tesco has sold this wine for £10.99 on only 63 days in the past year, while on 58 days it was £4.99 – less than the supposed half-price offer.

Also at Tesco, Hardy’s Legacy Shiraz was £4.99, down from £9.99, yet in March it was only £4.

Sainsbury’s was selling Toretta de Mondelli Pinot Grigio for £5.32, marketed as ‘Save 33%, was £7.99’.However the wine was priced at £7.99 for only 16 days in the past 365, according to mySupermarket.

On 148 days it was being sold for £4.99 – again less than the current ‘offer’ price. Asda had Campo Viejo Crianza at £6, down from £8.50.

But according to mySupermarket it has been sold at £8.50 for only 85 days in the past year and had been as low as £5.

And at Waitrose, Robert Mondavi Woodbridge Chardonnay – currently on a ‘Save £2’ offer at £7.99, was only £6.29 in April.

'Yo-yo' pricing means that shops inflate the price of a bottle in the weeks before it goes on offer to make the discount seem larger

The mySupermarket research is based on store’s websites so does not cover Morrisons, while Aldi does not run wine promotions.

The offers are not illegal as rules on ‘price establishment’ require only that the higher price cited in the promotion has applied recently for 28 consecutive days.

Nevertheless former Sainsbury’s wine buyer Allan Cheeseman said some supermarket offers were ‘blatantly manufactured’.

‘You will see a Mondelli or an Ogio on sale for a very high price for a period of time, then discounted massively,’ he said. ‘The problem is that as a nation we have become promotion junkies.’

Most stores insisted they were simply responding to what shoppers wanted.

Tesco said: ‘We realise that not every wine will be to the particular taste of every customer, but our half-price wine offers remain popular, indicating customers are satisfied with both the quality and value for money.’

Sainsbury’s blamed its fluctuating prices on harvest yields, transport costs and global demand.

‘We work hard to mitigate these and keep prices down for customers, including offering price reductions and promotions whenever possible’ it said.

And Waitrose took issue with the mySupermarket research, pointing out that the Robert Mondavi wine had been sold for the full price of £9.99 on 127 days since May.
