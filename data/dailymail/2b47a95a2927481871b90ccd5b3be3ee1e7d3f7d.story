Illness: Lilian Kershaw, 84, developed the little-known disease bird fancier's lung after breathing in particles from her grandson's cockatiel Charlie, causing breathing problems

A grandmother died from a rare and deadly lung condition after almost ten years of being exposed to her grandson's pet cockatiel.

Lilian Kershaw, 84, developed the little-known disease bird fancier's lung after breathing in particles from the bird's droppings and feathers when its cage was being cleaned out,

Despite never handling cockatiel Charlie, the retired cotton mill worker became increasingly breathless while exposed to the bird in her living room, an inquest heard.

But unbeknown to her family the ill health was partly due to the bird, which was bought for grandson Lloyd in 2002.

Mrs Kershaw's death was passed to the coroner over fears that her employment in the cotton mills could have resulted in an industrial type disease.

But further inquiries into her death were prompted because of the presence of the cockatiel, with a doctor having previously diagnosed her with the condition.

After a coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death, daughter Denise Bacchas, 56, said: 'I certainly regret buying Charlie, my son will be heartbroken.

'Hindsight is a wonderful thing and if we had known we would never have got Charlie.

'I'd never even heard of this before and it was not something that had crossed my mind, we just thought she was a little old lady with a lot of health problems.'

The bird has since been handed over to a local RSPCA bird sanctuary to be rehoused.

Mrs Bacchas added: 'Of course we were
 attached to Charlie as you are with a pet but he had to go when we 
found out he was affecting mum. There was no other option, by then it 
just had to be done.'

The
 widow, who had six children and 13 grandchildren, lived with her 
daughter and grandson Lloyd, 24, at their home In Failsworth, Oldham.

She had become wheelchair-bound after developing arthritis.

The
 inquest heard that Mrs Kershaw had developed breathing problems in 
later life, which were blamed on damp conditions in a previous house.

Bird fancier's lung is a rare allergic reaction caused by inhaling dust from the feathers and droppings of certain birds.

Birds linked with the disease include parrots, pigeons and budgerigars.

It is one a group of conditions, known as hypersensitivity pneumonitis, that relate to the breathing in of dust from organic materials.

Symptoms usually develop four hours after exposure, including breathlessness and coughing.

The symptoms, which can also include a high temperature and wheezing in extreme cases, usually disappear within three hours of exposure.

The disease can become progressive, causing loss of weight, fatigue and breathing difficulty.

Corticosteroids will relieve the symptoms, but preventing exposure to the dust is the easiest way of easing the symptoms.

When cleaning the bird's cage, Mrs Bacchas would take the sandpaper-lined bottom from it, putting the bird's droppings in a bin bag.

She added: 'My mother never handled him, nobody could because he was so vicious. He would peck you to death and he would draw blood. Whoever cleaned him would have to wear gloves.'

She added that her mother rarely spent time in the loving room where the bird was kept but had to walk past it to get into other rooms.

The inquest was told that Mrs Kershaw had been treated for lung disease and congestive heart failure.

She also had panic attacks and became scared and frightened saying she couldn't breath and had to be taken into the fresh air for walks.

Mrs Kershaw became reliant on oxygen for 18 months before her death and was referred to a chest physician at the Pennines Acute Hospital in 2010 because of the breathlessness.

After breaking her collarbone, a 
frail Mrs Kershaw was admitted to the Royal Oldham Hospital on November 
1 in 2011 where she rapidly deteriorated. She died on November 13 last 
year.

Dr Georges Ng Man Qwong, who diagnosed
 her with the condition before her death, told the inquest that she had 
had an allergic reaction in her lungs because of contact with the dust 
and protein emitted from the bird.

He
 said: 'Bird fancier's lung is an uncommon condition and we do not see 
it very often and a GP may only see a case once every 10 years.

'It
 is caused by the exposure to a bird's protein in the feathers or 
excrete. We do not know why people get it, but if they inhale the 
protein there can be an allergic reaction in the lungs.

Employment: It was initially thought that Mrs Kershaw's death may have been linked to her previous employment in Oldham's cotton mills, before the rare disease came to light

Deteriorated: Mrs Kershaw was admitted to the Royal Oldham Hospital in November 2011 after breaking her collarbone. Her health rapidly deteriorated and she died on November 13 last year

'Contact with the protein and dust from the bird can happen when cleaning out the cage, the dust can become airborne and can be breathed in.

'If you are exposed it can cause illness even a few hours after cleaning the cage you can feel quite breathless. If you are exposed to the protein over time it can cause a reaction and it is seen as progressive breathlessness.'

Dr Ng Man Qwong added that the diagnosis was supported by blood tests, CT scans and said that she was put on steroid therapy and exposure to the bird was to be reduced.

Rochdale coroner Mr Simon Nelson said it was the first time in 10 years he had come across such an occurrence of Bird Fancier's Lung.

He said: 'It was sadly and unbeknown to her at 
the time of her exposure to dust and protein emulated by Charlie that 
brought about her death.

'It would be an unnatural occurring 
disease process, the only factor to bear in mind is whether she was 
particularly susceptible, I do feel that her death was by reason of the 
lung disease Bird Fancier's Lung.'
