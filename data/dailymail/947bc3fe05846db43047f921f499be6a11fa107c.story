Final straw: New York Philharmonic Music Director Alan Gilbert saw red when a mobile phone went off during a New York Philharmonic performance

For many it is just one of the daily afflictions of the digital age. 

But when a mobile phone went off during a New York Philharmonic performance the conductor saw red, stopping the orchestra in its tracks.

Orchestra music director Alan Gilbert was so appalled by the continuing distraction during one of the most poignant parts of the performance that he brought the musicians to a standstill.

The phone’s 'marimba' ring-tone went off from a front row seat of New York's Avery Fisher Hall during Tuesday night's performance, according to eyewitnesses. 

The untimely interruption happened 
during the final and most moving bars of Mahler's Ninth symphony, just
 13 bars before the beginning of the last page of the score, blogger 
Michael Jo reported. 

Jo
 wrote on his blog thousandfold echo: ‘As Alan Gilbert turned to the 
first violins and the sound grew ever more hushed and veiled, the 
unmistakable chimes of the iPhone Marimba ringtone resounded loud and 
clear’.

In full flow: Mr Gilbert conducting the New York Philharmonic. The phone went off in the front row during the final and most moving bars of Mahler's Ninth symphony

In an almost unprecedented measure, an obviously annoyed Mr Gilbert cut the orchestra.

The conductor then turned around on the podium to face the offender, the superconductor blog reported.

During a pause of several minutes the
 music director asked 'Are you finished?' When the culprit didn’t reply 
he said: ‘Fine, we'll wait.'

Some furious members of the audience called out for punishment: 'Thousand dollar fine, Get out!' and 'Kick him out! we all heard'

When the ringing eventually stopped Mr Gilbert asked the man if he had turned off the phone. The man indicated that it wouldn't go off again.

Addressing the audience the conductor
 said: 'I apologize. Usually, when there's a disturbance like this, it 
is best to ignore it, because addressing it is sometimes worse than the 
disturbance itself. But this was so egregious that I could not allow 
it.'

'We'll start again.'

Mahler Ninth is the composer’s final 
completed symphony, the last movement of which is a measured 
contemplation on death that ultimately falls silent.

The composer’s work has special 
meaning to the New York Philharmonic which Mahler conducted 
during the final years of his life.
