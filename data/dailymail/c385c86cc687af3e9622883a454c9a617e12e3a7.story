Prince Andrew last night spoke out personally for the first time over allegations he slept with a woman who claims she was a teenage ‘sex slave’.

In an unprecedented move, the strained-looking royal used a televised speech to repeat Buckingham Palace’s ‘emphatic’ denials that he had ever had ‘any form of sexual contact or relationship’ with his accuser, Virginia Roberts.

His reference to the scandal, which contained 46 words and lasted only 37 seconds during his address at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, was brief and limited.

In Davos: Prince Andrew spoke for the first time to deny the sex accusations, at the World Economic Forum

But the very fact that the Queen’s son, a man who is fifth in line to the throne, even felt he had no choice but to speak out was remarkable.

Reading from carefully scripted notes, the prince said: ‘Firstly I think I must, and want, for the record to refer to the events that have taken place in the last few weeks.

‘And I just wish to reiterate and to reaffirm the statements which have already been made on my behalf by Buckingham Palace.’

He added: ‘My focus is on my work and this evening’s reception allows me to tell you about just a couple of the initiatives that I have founded and am passionate about.’

Denial: Prince Andrew (pictured with Virginia Roberts in 2001) fiercely denies ‘any form of sexual contact or relationship’ with her

Weeks of damaging claims about his alleged relationship with Miss Roberts were sparked at the beginning of the month when her lawyers lodged papers with a US court as part of a legal battle against the prince’s friend, billionaire banker Jeffrey Epstein, who served a prison sentence for sex crimes involving under-age girls. 

In the papers, she claimed that Epstein had not only repeatedly abused her from the age of 15 but had also ‘procured’ her for several of his ‘powerful’ friends, including Andrew.

Miss Roberts alleges she and the royal had sex when she was aged around 17, still a minor under US law in some states.

Buckingham Palace has issued two strong denials on Andrew’s behalf, which state that not only is there is no foundation in the allegations but that he never had any sexual contact or relationship with his accuser.

Then on Wednesday papers were filed in a Florida court revealing that Miss Roberts’s lawyers have written to Andrew asking him to testify on oath about the nature of their relationship. 

Miss Roberts’s lawyers sent Buckingham Palace a letter (above) requesting his ‘voluntary cooperation in answering question about his sexual interactions’ with her

Sources at last night’s Davos party said you ‘could have heard a pin drop’ as the prince started to speak, with some describing it as an ‘awkward quiet’.

Courtiers said it had not been an ‘easy or comfortable’ decision for the prince to speak publicly about such a personal issue.

But after long conversations with senior aides and legal advisers, he concluded that the continuing allegations were so damaging he had no choice but to confront them.

The packed reception at the five-star Belvedere Hotel was held amid tight security.

It is a big annual draw at Davos, and this year attracted the likes of disgraced former Barclays boss Bob Diamond, BT boss Gavin Patterson, BP’s Bob Dudley, Mark Bolland of Marks & Spencer and former trade secretary Lord Mandelson.

Former Labour prime minister Tony Blair, accompanied by his wife Cherie, was also there, however he was said to have left before the prince took to his feet.

Many of the prince’s supporters greeted him warmly. John Cridland, director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said Prince Andrew was right to turn up to Davos and host the reception.

‘He has always been a big advocate of British business,’ he said.

Another male friend was seen to put his hand supportively on his shoulder for a few moments, prompting a smiling Andrew to shake him by the hand.

The prince, dressed in a smart suit but with trainers on due to the slippery conditions outside, left in a chauffeur-driven Range Rover 15 minutes after the event ended at 8pm local time.

Andrew was driven back to the nearby ski resort of Klosters, where he is staying in a luxury chalet owned by William Lawton, a senior executive for HSBC’s Private Bank in Singapore.

Sources said the prince is paying for the cost of the trip himself.

It is not known whether Prince Andrew is covered by legal immunity simply by being a royal because this has never been tested in international law.

However, the prince may be entitled to diplomatic immunity against questioning in any criminal inquiry because some of the allegations relate to when he was a Whitehall-sanctioned business envoy. 

Diplomatic immunity protects foreign diplomats from legal action in the country where they work.

Extradition lawyer Karen Todner said the prince could be formally asked to give evidence ‘only in criminal proceedings’.

If he refused to co-operate, he could in theory be banned from entering America.

The letter offered to interview the prince, pictured on a skiing holiday on January 4 after the initial allegations were revealed, under oath. But her lawyers said the letter had been 'refused by the recipient'

Smiling coyly for the camera in a simple white blouse, this is Virginia Roberts around the time she has accused Prince Andrew of having sex with her.

The photograph was taken by paedophile billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, the man she says turned her into a ‘sex slave’ and procured her for the Queen’s son.

Photos: Virginia pictured aged 17 (left), in a picture taken by Epstein, and aged 15 (right). These pictures are two of five photos included in Miss Roberts's new legal submission

The snapshot is one of five photos included in Miss Roberts’s new legal submission to show how young she looked. ‘I was approximately 17 at the time,’ she said.

She adds: ‘I visited and travelled with Jeffrey Epstein from 1999 through the summer of 2002.

‘I had sex with him often in these places and also with the various people he demanded that I have sex with.’ She said she included the photos to ‘illustrate my connection to these places’.
