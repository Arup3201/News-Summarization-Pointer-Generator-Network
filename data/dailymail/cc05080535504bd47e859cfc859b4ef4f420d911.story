Rennes striker Paul-Georges Ntep scored one of the most audacious goals ever seen on the final day of the French Ligue 1 season - but was it the ultimate act of showboating or disrespectful gamesmanship?

The 21-year-old did not little to improve relationships with rival club Reims in what should have been a meaningless mid-table clash before everyone turned their attention to holidays.

Rennes were already leading 2-1 when Ntep steals the ball from the out of position Reims goalkeeper.

Best foot forward? Paul Georges Ntep scored an outrageous goal that was either entertaining or insulting

Step 1: Ntep steals the ball from a well out of position Reims goalkeeper

Step 2: The France U21 international races through clear on the unguarded goal

Step 3: Just as he gets there Ntep stops the ball on the goal line and stoops to his hands and knees

Step 4: To complete his party trick, Ntep nudges the ball over the line just before a Reims defender arrives

But, instead of just passing the ball into an unguarded net, Ntep races towards the goalline before stopping the ball, stooping to his hands and knees and nudging it over to complete a 3-1 victory.

Even the late, great George Best, who was something of a showman himself, admitted thinking against using the trick while playing for Manchester United.

While the France Under 21 international will have gained cult status from his own supporters, it's unlikely that any of his opponents will be sending him a postcard during the off-season.
