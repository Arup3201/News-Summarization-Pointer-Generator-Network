For Yasmine Smart, granddaughter of circus supremo Billy and niece to Billy Smart Jr, childhood was like growing up in Disneyland.

'I used to think the chimps were my best friends. They'd come to my birthday parties. And I'd play with lions and tigers and polar bears. It's only as an adult that I came to realise just what a great childhood it was.'

She's back with Billy Smart's Circus on a tour that will criss-cross the UK for the rest of the year. But any preconceptions of a brash circus veteran, sawdust in her veins, are dispelled in the flesh.

Yasmine is now the Ringmaster of her uncles legendary circus

Yasmine, who now takes the role of ringmistress, sounds a bit like Angela Rippon and looks quite a lot like Fiona Bruce's glamorous elder sister. Her family's story is one of fabulous wealth, fierce rivalries and – in Billy Smart Jnr – a playboy dedicated to the pursuit of famous female flesh.

Diana Dors, Jayne Mansfield, Shirley Bassey and, yes, even Princess Margaret (or so it was rumoured) all had their names linked to the flamboyant showman in the 50s and 60s.

The story begins in the 1930s when Billy Smart Snr, one of 23 children and father to 11, set up a successful travelling fairground. Immediately after the war he added a modest circus which quickly went on to eclipse the funfair. Yasmine recalls her grandfather with affection.

Billy Smart was known for hosting some of the world's most glamorous celebrities

'I was 12 when he died but I remember him well. He was a big personality and a wonderful grandfather although an extremely old-fashioned, autocratic father. He had seven daughters and insisted they were locked up in their caravans by nine o'clock when the funfair was travelling the country.'

In 1966, Billy Snr collapsed over a cup of tea in his caravan, felled by a fatal heart attack at 72. There was no shortage of family members only too happy to carry on plying the famous name, and the three surviving brothers – David (Yasmine's father), Ronnie and Billy Jnr – picked up the baton.

'My father was the impresario, Uncle Ronnie was the businessman and Uncle Billy was the larger-than-life figure who appeared in the show.'

He was the second Billy Smart Jnr. Tragically, the first died as a lad following an accident in which a vat of scalding water fell on him.

'My grandparents' 11th child was a boy they named Stanley but he hated it and was soon known as Billy, something he changed officially by deed poll when he was older.'

The second Billy Smart Jnr quickly became the stuff of legend. Though it was known to few at the time, he was illiterate, unable to read or write until the day he died.

He'd ask his wife Hanna or only daughter Baccara to tell him what was on the menu so he could order in a restaurant and then get one or other of them to sign his cheques.

But all that happened much later. Billy didn't succumb to marriage until he reached his 40s. First, there was the urgent business of sowing as many wild oats as possible. A child at the time, Yasmine can still remember rumblings of an affair between her uncle and Princess Margaret.

'She came to see one of the shows,' she says, 'and spent lots of time with him in his trailer afterwards.'

She can also recall Shirley Bassey being a frequent visitor. 'This was the very end of the 50s and she'd just had her first big hit, Kiss Me, Honey Honey, Kiss Me. I deliberately learnt the words so I could sing them to her. She couldn't have been nicer to me.'

Yasmine was her Uncle Billy's favourite niece, she says. 'Every Sunday I'd go and have a cuddle with him. It was entirely innocent, I should add. But I do remember one particular Sunday trotting over and discovering three girls in his trailer: a blonde, a brunette and a redhead.  I was little but I felt very indignant. Clearly he liked having his hands full.'

Princess Margaret, Billy Smart and Yasmine when the Princess came to visit the circus

Billy Smart Jnr cut a similar dash in his professional dealings. When the costs of touring became prohibitive at the beginning of the 70s, the big tent was folded for the last time and the three brothers bought Windsor Safari Park as well as a 100-room mansion overlooking it.

The Smarts still performed charity shows for the Variety Club and presented TV specials every Easter and Christmas. Yasmine enjoyed a certain notoriety on these TV shows in which she was ringmistress, the first woman to perform such a role and kitted out in fishnet tights, black boots and a red tailcoat.

'I had quite a following. My father used to vet my fan mail in case it contained anything he judged to be unsuitable.'

Billy was dazzled by celebrity. Stanley Baker, Michael Caine, Paul Newman – all became friends of the family (Caine later became godfather to Billy's daughter).

'Princess Maragaret came to see one of the shows and spent lots of time with him in his trailer afterwards'

Ringo Starr was a regular visitor with the other Beatles dropping round from time to time. After one of Elvis Presley's concerts in America, Billy invited him out for a drink, impressed so legend has it by the King's impeccable manners.

And then there were the Royals. Prince Rainier of Monaco loved the circus and would often come to visit. Although the British Royals were fans of Windsor Safari Park – and near neighbours, of course – the relationship suffered a strain after a visit from Prince Charles in the 70s.

The Smart brothers had bought a whale, unaware that it was a killer. Charles phoned one day to ask if he could swim with the newcomer.

Just as the whale was beginning to eye up the heir to the throne, he was hauled out of the water in the nick of time. 'I don't think his parents were amused,' says Yasmine. 'He nearly became the Prince of Whales.'

Yasmine was heartbroken when the circus folded in 1971. 'They told me it would only be for a year and that all efforts in the meantime had to go into the safari park. But everyone got too comfortable living in bricks, as it's known, the park was making lots of money and life was much easier than being on the road.'

For the past two decades she's mostly performed in circuses in Europe and America. But when her father, David, died in 2007 of lung cancer, she returned to the UK to be nearer her mother, Olga. Billy had died two years earlier aged 70.

Yasmine's cousin Gary revived the circus in 1993 and now, after nearly four decades, she's once again back in scarlet tails and high boots, 'but no fishnets these days,' she says with a smile.

'The moment I stepped into the ring and said: "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Billy Smart's Circus," it just felt right. It was like coming home.'
