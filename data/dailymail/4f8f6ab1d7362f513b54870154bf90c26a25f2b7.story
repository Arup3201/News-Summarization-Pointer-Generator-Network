Snooze channel: Hampshire County Council's tv channel has been dubbed 'Ken TV' after leader Ken Thornber, pictured

It is hard to imagine there are too many people keen to watch council meeting proceedings as they happen.

But, clearly, Hampshire County Council thinks differently.

The cash-strapped council spent £220,000 of taxpayers money on a TV channel to broadcast their meetings live.

But the snooze channel only attracted 57 viewers for its last performance.

Viewing figures have plummeted as those who tuned in were exposed to 'terribly boring' debates that often last for hours.

Councillors have also been blasted for 'in-fighting' and talking 'waffle', as their debates are streamed worldwide over the internet.

The cost works out a staggering £3869.65 per viewer for their last broadcast, which is 26 times more than a colour TV licence.

One was even the daughter of a councillor who had tuned in from Hong Kong to see what her father was doing.

Now there are calls for Hampshire County Council to pull the plug on the scheme, dubbed 'Ken TV' after their leader Ken Thornber.

The Conservative-led council has axed 1,400 jobs since January 2011 in a bid to save £100million over two years.

Those who have lost their jobs include librarians, museum workers and administrative staff.

Cllr Thornber previously said: 'Reducing our costs further will neither be easy or painless.'

Riveting: Hampshire County Council streamed meetings to 'encourage greater understanding'

More than 800 people tuned in to watch the first televised budget in February when the ruling Tories approved cuts of £45million.

But just 108 people watched May’s meeting and a mere 57 tuned in to this month’s meeting.

A cabinet meeting in April was watched by 167 people, who tuned in live or delved into the council’s video archive.

Conservative Cllr Thornber revealed the figures at the most recent council meeting, adding: 'Maybe Cabinet is more popular than the council.'

He was heckled by a councillor on the Liberal Democrat benches, who shouted out: 'More comedy', to laughter in the chamber.

The council spent £223,000 on audio, video and web-streaming equipment and paying an outside company to operate it.

County chiefs hoped the project would 
'increase transparency' and 'encourage greater understanding and 
participation' in local decision making.

A
spokesman said at the time of launch: 'With so much of Hampshire being 
rural in nature, residents from all corners of the county who may not 
normally have the opportunity to attend meetings themselves, will be 
able to follow the discussions and debates that are streamed live over 
the internet, from a computer in their home, school or office.

'It will also be possible to watch previously webcasted meetings.

'Viewers will be able to skip through to individual items on the agenda or to individual speakers, which will make meetings even more accessible and open to all.

'By opening up some public meetings to a wider audience in this way, we hope that this will empower local residents and communities.'

But Councillor Keith House, Liberal Democrat opposition spokesman, said it was a 'waste of money'.

He said: 'The Liberal Democrats have always said this was a waste of money and could have helped keep library hours up or more buses or youth services in place.

'It’s always been a Conservative vanity project.'

Christine Melsom, from anti-council-tax group IsItFair, said: 'The TV channel is a waste of money.

'I am not at all surprised it gets so few viewers because council meetings are terribly boring - even for someone like me who is interested in local politics.'

Mrs Melsom said the broadcasts had a 'novelty value' but viewers were turned-off by meetings that last for hours, 'waffle' and party political in-fighting.

However Councillor Colin Davidovitz, who is responsible for communications at the council, said he was not disappointed by the viewing figures.

Cllr Davidovitz said the channel was a good use of taxpayers’ money and added: 'These viewing figures are to be expected.

'The first meeting was the budget setting meeting and there was a lot of interest.

'The Cabinet meeting also attracted interest as there was discussion about the amalgamation of a couple of schools.

'My daughter watches from Hong Kong to see what her father is up to.'
