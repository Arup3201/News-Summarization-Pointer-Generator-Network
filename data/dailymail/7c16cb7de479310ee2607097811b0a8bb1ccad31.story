Mario Mandzukic took a step closer to leaving Bayern Munich today when he was left out of Pep Guardiola's squad for the German Cup final.

The 27-year-old Croat is wanted by Arsenal, Chelsea and Real Madrid but Guardiola has dropped him, allegedly for disciplinary reasons.

Mandzukic has played a key role for the Bavarians this season, scoring 26 goals in all competitions but also clashed with Guardiola in January when he was excluded from the team.

Man in charge: Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola says that Manzukic could've played against Dortmund despite an injury

'He was injured, but on the other hand he actually was able to play,' Guardiola said cryptically.

'But I decided to take 18 players with me. And Mandzukic is not in the squad.'

The Bundesliga champions were initially reluctant to sell Mandzukic despite Robert Lewandowski arriving next season from Saturday's opponents Borussia Dortmund but now they are willing to listen to offers.

Arsenal have made enquiries to ascertain the scale of the fee and wages while Chelsea want him as a second striker to support and cover Diego Costa.

Guardiola wants Chelsea's £30m-rated defender David Luiz and could be willing to agree a compromise deal with Mandzukic, also valued at £30m, going the other way but the Croat is keen to play regularly rather than be a secondary figure.

That may 
put Arsenal in a stronger position depending on what happens to Olivier 
Giroud and whether they push for Karim Benzema instead.

Madrid
 have other other priorities but Mandzukic will not be short of offers 
with Manchester United and City also watching events unfold.

Bayern
 Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge says the club is open to 
Mandzukic leaving the club due to the imminent arrival of Robert 
Lewandowski.

Rummenigge said: 'Naturally if Mario stays it won't be easy for him because a world class player is coming to us. The question is whether he confronts this competition or would rather go to another club.'

Mandzukic was dropped by Guardiola despite being fit for Saturday's German Cup final against Borussia Dortmund, fueling speculation he is leaving the club.

Rummenigge says, 'We'll talk openly and fairly about everything. The issue is open.'

Lewandowski is joining Bayern on July 1 after failing to reach an agreement with Dortmund on extending his four-year contract.
