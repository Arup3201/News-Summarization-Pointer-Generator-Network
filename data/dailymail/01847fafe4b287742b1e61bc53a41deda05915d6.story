David Moyes is on Inter Milan’s shortlist as the Italian giants scout Europe for a new manager with current coach Walter Mazzarri coming under increasing pressure with the club struggling in Serie A.

The former Manchester United and Everton manager is considered a potential replacement for Mazzarri, whose team plays Cesena today and who is under considerable pressure after a run of poor results which has seen Inter sink to ninth in the table.

But though Moyes himself has always made it clear the coaching abroad would appeal to him, the current instability at the Italian club may deter him should he be offered the job.

Current Inter manager  Walter Mazzarri is coming under increasing pressure with the club struggling in Serie A

Former owner and president Massimo Moratti resigned from his honourary post on Friday, having publicly questioned Mazzarri. 

New owner Indonesian Erick Thohir has stuck by the former Napoli boss until now – but the Moratti family still own one third of the club and, according to reports in Italy, the boardroom split has been caused by their desire to sack Mazzarri now.

Michael Bolingbroke, the former chief operating officer at Manchester United, is the current chief executive at Inter and would provide an obvious point of contact and potential reassurance to Moyes. 

Former Everton boss Moyes is currently without a club after being sacked by Manchester United in April 2014

Bolingbroke had already announced he was moving to Inter before Moyes was sacked by United last April and so had no direct part in his dismissal.

Moving to Serie A would be an attractive option to Moyes, especially to one of Europe’s superclubs. 

Though Inter are currently playing in the Europa League and finished fifth last season, there is clearly an expectation of qualifying for Champions League football, which would allow Moyes to prove himself again at that level after his disappointment in following Sir Alex Ferguson at United.

However, he is known to regard the stability of a club as a key factor when he does come back to management, meaning Inter would have to present a united front to convince him it was the right job.
