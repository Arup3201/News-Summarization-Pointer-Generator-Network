Lily Allen has upset health campaigners by accepting money to plug an e-cigarette

Lily Allen has been condemned by health experts for being paid to plug e-cigarettes in the video for her song Hard Out Here.

The mother of two, said to be worth about £8 million, was paid an unspecified sum to promote E-Lites, which deliver a nicotine hit in vapour form.

The video features dancers taking drags on the devices – promoted as alternatives to cigarettes with the suggestion they help smokers to quit – and close-ups of the packaging.

It comes after a Public Health England report on the uptake of  e-cigarettes last month warned of the risks of their promotion by celebrities on young people.

Last night one of its authors, Professor Linda Bauld, said: ‘There really isn’t any role for celebrity endorsements in  e-cigarette advertising.’

She warned that using an icon such as the pop star ‘makes the product look very appealing’.

The organisation’s director for health and wellbeing, Professor Kevin Fenton, has now called for ‘rapid action’ to introduce regulation, while charity Action on Smoking and Health said the brand should be ‘ashamed’.

An E-Lites spokesman said: ‘The Lily Allen video is 18-plus and not targeted at teens.’

A spokesman for the singer declined to comment.
