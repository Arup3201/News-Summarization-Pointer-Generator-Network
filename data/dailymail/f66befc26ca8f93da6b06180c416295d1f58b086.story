A stone with unusual carvings that was sold as a garden ornament could contain a hidden message.

Plucked from a garden in Leicester, the stone was purchased by an archaeologist who believes the intricate pattern was probably carved in Anglo Saxon times, over 1,000 years ago.

James Balme, who is also a television presenter, said that the pattern ‘may be some form of writing,’ although there are so far no suggestions about what the 'text' or shapes may mean.

The intricately carved stone block (pictured) was discovered in a garden in Leicester and was purchased by an archaeologist who believes the carving dates from Anglo Saxon times, over 1,000 years ago.t could even be a form of writing and hide a message.

It is believed that the sandstone block was discovered several years ago and someone thought it would make an interesting decorative feature in the garden.

Mr Balme found the stone while he was looking for interesting stone carvings to buy on an auction website.

'I came across the carved stone block that was up for sale as an "unusual garden ornament," he told MailOnline.

'As I immediately recognised just how important it could prove to be I just had to purchase it to save it from ending up in another garden or even thrown away at worst. 

'At the time it was dirty, covered in moss and a lot of the carved pattern was not clearly visible. 

'When I finally received the stone I was shocked as it seemed far more important than I had first thought - and after gentle cleaning the true extent of the carving became clear.  

It weighs around 60lbs (27kg) and is wider at the base than at the top.

The ‘ornament’ caught Mr Balme’s eye because of its unusual shape and upon closer inspection, he noticed the carving.  

He told LiveScience: ‘It's possible the ‘pattern carved may be some form of writing’. 

The relief work does not resemble any known text, however, but the shape and style of the rock is typical of Anglo-Saxon monumental art.  

He told MailOnline: 'Regarding the carvings on the stone my initial feeling is that these are symbols rather than straightforward text. 

'There is a great deal of further research to be done in the coming weeks and months.'

Mr Balme suggested that the stone could be ‘a keystone from an archway or indeed a vaulted ceiling.’

He also tweeted that the stone could be the base of a cross or a tombstone.

The hand-carved rock is 18 inches (46cm) tall and 5.5 inches (14cm) thick.

In 2009, a garden ornament that had been sitting on a patio for 20 years turned out to be a 3,000-year-old ancient Egyptian jar.

The 13inch-high vessel was made during the time of the pharaohs to hold the organs of the dead ready for the afterlife.

With a distinctive top in the style of a face and easily recognisable headdress, the Canopic funerary jar had blended into its surroundings in an English garden for two decades.  

The terracotta jar with the top shaped with the face of the god Imseti was built to hold a human liver. The goddess Isis would have protected it.

Dating from the New Kingdom - 1550-1069 BC - the brown-coloured jar would once have been a painted receptacle fit for a pyramid. 

The owner of the jar, from Dorset, explained: 'It came from an uncle who was a bit of a collector and when he died about 20 years ago it came to us.

'We didn't know what it was and we have kept it on the patio and in the shed over the years. 

'It was just used as a decorative piece, a lump of stone.

'Then I looked at it and saw it had a face and it looked a bit Egyptian so we took it in to be valued and was told it was from ancient Egypt.

'It was a great surprise that something that had been sitting there for some time unrecognised turned out to be so old.'

The unusual stone is only decorated on one side, although there are chisel marks on other faces.

Mr Balme believes the stone dates to the Anglo-Saxon period, which stretched between 410 and 1066AD.

The period is known for its intricate patterns, which appeared on buildings and jewellery, for example, as well as written literature such as the poem Beowulf.

However, the date is only a guess and he has asked his Twitter followers for help in learning more about the mysterious stone.

He Tweeted: 'Any help welcomed in identifying this carved stone recently recovered, is is Saxon or earlier ???'

Restoring the block to its original state has been a labour of love and Mr Balme has gently removed paint applied to the stone.

He said: '[It’s] one of my best finds ever'.

On his YouTube page, he added that the stone could  'prove to be of major importance in the story of Saxon Britain.'

But he is not the only person to stumble on an interesting archaeological find in a garden.

And in the town of Migdal in Israel, architectural remains were being used as garden ornaments, which led experts to discover a Biblical settlement, including an ancient house with a bathtub inside.
