She had just thrown a tantrum, as little girls do, after her mother and father told her she couldn’t go out to play.

But April Jones cried and kept asking to be allowed outside – so eventually they gave in.

Less than 20 minutes later she was gone, driven into the darkness.

Heartbroken: April Jones's parents Paul and 
Coral (pictured today) had not wanted their daughter to go out to play 
on the night she disappeared, the jury heard today

Trial: Mark Bridger arrives at court today, where he denies kidnapping and murder

Yesterday her mother relived the 
heartbreaking moment she let her five-year-old daughter play on the 
street that evening and never saw her again.

Coral Jones said she and her husband 
Paul had both told April it was too late to go outside on her bike. ‘She
kept on and on and had a little bit of a tantrum,’ Mrs Jones said.

‘We eventually gave in. I zipped up 
her coat and she went off to play outside with her friend. I told her I 
didn’t want her to be long. I think that was around 7pm. This was the 
last time I saw her.’

Mrs Jones said that at about 7.20pm it was getting dark and colder, and she wanted April to come back inside.

‘I sent her brother out to get her in
and within a very short time he came running home in an hysterical 
state. When I calmed him down he said April’s best friend said she had 
got into a car with a man and she had gone.

‘I was frantically trying to find her. I searched around the estate everywhere I could think of. I even looked in bins.’

By that time, however, April was 
already in the hands of her killer. The prosecution says Mark Bridger 
murdered her after driving her off in his Land Rover.

Yesterday the 47-year-old former 
slaughterhouse worker – who claims he accidentally ran April over and 
can’t remember what he did with her after bundling her into the 
passenger seat – wept and bowed his head in the dock as the girl’s final
moments with her family emerged.

Mrs Jones, 43, sat with her 
41-year-old husband in the public gallery of Mold Crown Court as their 
written accounts of what happened that evening were read to a jury.

Each wore a pink ribbon in April’s memory and occasionally held hands.

Carole Jones said that her daughter April was a 'happy-go-lucky child'

Their statements to police told how an ordinary day with their ‘happy-go-lucky little girl’ turned to tragedy.

‘April had been complaining of an 
upset tummy that morning but she was fine,’ Mrs Jones said. ‘We had a 
cwtch in bed – that’s Welsh for a hug or a cuddle.’

While Mr Jones made breakfast, she 
dressed her daughter, tied her blonde hair in a plait and sent her off 
to school with her father. After a day shopping, they picked her up from
school.

‘She was a bit grumpy because she was tired,’ Mrs Jones said.

Filmed: Bridger was first filmed as he left his cottage on October 2, before they zoomed on him walking down the hill from his home

Footage: A camera at the Tuffins garage spotted Bridger's car, which may have contained April at the time, the court heard

But she cheered up when they dropped 
her off for a swimming lesson at the local leisure centre near their 
home in Machynlleth, mid-Wales, while they attended her school parents’ 
evening.

When they brought her home, April ate
a whole plate of spaghetti on toast then watched her favourite film – 
the Disney animation Tangled.

Mr Jones said she was pleading to be allowed out to play with her seven-year-old best friend but they told her it was too late.

‘She had a little paddy and I suppose
we just gave in,’ he said. The couple said April knew about ‘stranger 
danger’ and would never have got into a car with someone she didn’t 
know.

There were links between them and 
Bridger, the court heard – Mrs Jones used to play darts in his local pub
– but they were never friends, she said. Mr Jones got to know him when 
they dated sisters. Bridger was then about 32, he said. The sister was 
15.

‘I can’t think of any reason why Mark
Bridger would take April and hurt her,’ he said. ‘He’s a father too. I 
cannot understand why he would do this to me.’

Bridger had previously tried to 
befriend April’s teenage half-sister on Facebook, the court heard. But 
the 15-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, spoke to her 
mother, who told her not to accept his request.

Visit: Jurors arrive by coach at the home of Mark Bridger, Mount Pleasant in Ceinws, Mid Wales, on the third day of his trial for the abduction and murder of April Jones. it is surrounded by trees, outbuildings and a river runs down its left side

The court has previously been told how Bridger collected photographs of the girl from the internet.

They were saved on his computer along
with those of April, her other half-sisters and murder victims 
including Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman.

Bridger denies abduction, murder and perverting the course of justice.
The trial continues.
