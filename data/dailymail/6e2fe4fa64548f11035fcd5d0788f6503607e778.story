Its brutal concrete exterior and reputation as a dumping ground for society’s ills earned it the name ‘Hell’s waiting room’.

But now, one of London’s toughest council estates has been given a brighter look after its residents posed for photographs recreating famous works of art.

The images, which were inspired by the likes of Picasso, Rembrandt, Renoir, Beryl Cook and Andy Warhol, have been erected around the perimeter of the notorious Aylesbury Estate in Walworth, South-East London.

The giant canvases mask the demolition of parts of the sprawling 1960s development, which is undergoing a multi-million-pound, 15-year regeneration after the labyrinth of concrete corridors linking its 2,700 flats became a magnet for crime.

People living on the 28-acre estate volunteered to dress in costume and pose for the 15 photographs.

Charlotte Benstead, director of the Creation Trust, the group behind the art project, said it was a way to get tenants involved in the regeneration.

'Forgotten': Tony Blair chose the estate to make his first speech as Prime Minister, in which he described its 7,500 residents as the 'forgotten people' and promised to tackle their problems

Donna Grant, 51, moved to the Aylesbury Estate two days before her tenth birthday and appears  in the re-creation of Beryl Cook’s witty depiction of female bowlers, Sabotage. 

She said: ‘Taking part in the art project was one of the best things I’ve ever done. We had so much fun together – it was hilarious getting dressed up.’

Nursery assistant Ryan Harris, 18, who recreates a Vincent Van Gogh self-portrait, said: ‘I’m proud to have my photo up on a billboard – I’m one of the faces of Aylesbury.'

But not everyone is unhappy there. Tony Taitte, 61, who recreated a 1661 Rembrandt self- portrait, said: ‘Where I live will be knocked down soon. We are being asked if we want to stay on the estate or move elsewhere.

'I’m definitely staying. I love it here, it’s the very essence of London.’
