Scotland’s Justice Secretary told the Lockerbie bomber to drop his appeal to smooth the way for him to be released on compassionate grounds, it was claimed today.

Kenny MacAskill allegedly told Abdelbaset Al-Megrahi indirectly that he would be let out of jail in 2009 if he dropped his court case after he was given just three months to live.

Shortly before the official announcement Al-Megrahi did mysteriously abandon the appeal against his conviction - even though he was under no legal obligation to do so.

The bomber, who has terminal prostate cancer, is still alive in Libya two-and-a-half years after his release, to the embarrassment of the Scottish Government.

The Scottish Government has denied claims that Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill, pictured left, suggested that Abdelbaset Al-Megrahi, pictured at a Tripoli hospital in December 2009, drop his appeal against his conviction to smooth the way for being released on compassionate grounds because of his prostate cancer

The allegations - strongly denied by the Scottish government - appeared in a new book published today about the release entitled Megrahi: You Are My Jury.

It claims Abdelbaset Al-Megrahi was the 'innocent victim of dirty politics, a flawed investigation and judicial folly'.

Al-Megrahi is the only person to ever be convicted of the bombing of a Pam Am flight on December 21, 1988, which killed 270 people when it crashed in Lockerbie, Scotland.

He repeatedly proclaimed his innocence and launched several appeals against his conviction. However, he abandoned the case just days before Mr MacAskill announced he would be released from jail.

The new book claims that Mr MacAskill met a delegation of Libyan officials ten days before announcing his decision to release Megrahi, including foreign minister Abdulati Al-Obedi.

Al-Megrahi, now 59, claims in the new title: 'After the meeting, the Libyan delegation came to the prison to visit me.

'Obedi said that, towards the end of the meeting, MacAskill had asked to speak to him in private.

'Once the others had withdrawn, he stated that MacAskill gave him to understand that it would be easier to grant compassionate release if I dropped my appeal.

'He said he was not demanding that I do so, but the message seemed to me clear.

'I was legally entitled to continue the appeal, but I could not risk doing so. It meant abandoning my quest for justice.'

A Scottish Government spokesman branded the book, published today, as 'third-hand hearsay'.

He stated: 'We can say categorically that neither the Scottish Government had any involvement of any kind in Mr Al-Megrahi dropping his appeal, or indeed any interest in it.

'That was entirely a matter for Mr Al-Megrahi and his legal team.'

The book’s author John Ashton, who spent three years as a researcher with Megrahi’s legal team, also recounts a report in The Herald newspaper four days before the meeting citing 'a growing expectation he would be encouraged to first drop legal proceedings'.

Mr Ashton stated: 'The source of this information was not stated, but it seems likely that it was someone within the justice department.'

Scottish Labour's justice spokesman Lewis Macdonald said: 'Kenny MacAskill has repeatedly claimed that the decision for Al-Megrahi to drop his appeal was "a matter for him and the courts", yet these extraordinary reports throw all that into question.'

The MSP added: 'These are very serious allegations. If these reports are true, then Kenny MacAskill will have knowingly misled Parliament. It is only proper that he comes before Parliament as a matter of urgency to spell out exactly what happened at Greenock Prison and in the alleged private meetings with Col Gaddafi's ministers.

'The families of the victims deserve to know whether this secret meeting took place, and if so, exactly what was discussed.'

Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said: 'It is important that the Justice Secretary answers serious questions.'

Today a spokesman for David Cameron said that the Lockerbie bomber should never have been released.

He said: 'This is yet another reminder that Alex Salmond’s government’s decision to free the UK’s greatest mass murderer was wrong.

'Writing a book three years after he was released is an insult to the families of the 270 people who were murdered.'

But speaking at the launch of the book in Edinburgh this morning, Mr Ashton described these comments as 'outrageous'.

He said: 'The Prime Minister knows nothing about this case. He should read the book, and if he read the book he would know that this conviction was not safe.

'I think it is pretty outrageous that he would comment on something that he knows nothing about.'
