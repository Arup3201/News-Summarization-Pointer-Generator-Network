An Indonesian town was high on more than just life when police set fire to more than three tons of confiscated cannabis.    

Residents of Tangerang, 15.5 miles west of the capital Jakarta, reported suffering from headaches and dizziness after inhaling the tangy smoke given off by the bonfire. 

The 3.3 tons of marijuana were burned by Palmerah police at their subprecinct office in West Jakarta earlier this month.

Indonesian police accidentally intoxicated the population of the entire town of Tangerang, 15.5 miles west of Jakarta, by holding a bonfire of 3.3 tons of confiscated marijuana outside a subprecinct office

The haul was valued at $1 million, according to Breitbart.com

Tangerang police chief Senior Commander Riad told The Jakarta Post his officers seized the stash in south Tangerang on February 2.

Police wore masks to protect them from the fumes but watching civilians were left unprotected.

The smoke spread from the yard to surrounding residents' houses.

One resident named Deden said: 'I got a headache because I wasn't wearing a mask.'

A journalist reported having to 'sit down and have a cup of tea' to deal with the high.

Officers also destroyed 1.8 kilograms of crystal methamphetamine and 2,538 ecstasy pills by blending them.

The destruction of the illicit substances was witnessed by several officials from the West Jakarta municipality. 

A police officer throws packages of cannabis onto a fire  in Banda Aceh, Indonesia, in August last year. That blaze destroyed two tons of the drug while the latest one in Tangareng burned 3.3
