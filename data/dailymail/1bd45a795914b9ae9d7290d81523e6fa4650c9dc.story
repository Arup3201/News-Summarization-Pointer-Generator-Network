Basil the African Grey parrot should have been a prized exotic addition to any pet lover's home.

However, his new owners' pride soon turned to shock after he began hurling swear words at them - in a Welsh accent.

Sarah Fisk, 34, was thrilled when she brought Basil back to her house in Bristol and he greeted her with a polite 'hello'.

That was where the niceties ended, 
however, as the bird began chirruping a string of expletives before 
telling her, 'I'm in the Valleys.'

Sarah and Adam Fisk were left stunned when Basil the African Grey Parrot began swearing at them in a Welsh accent just hours after arriving at their home in Bristol

The care worker said: 'It was quite shocking the first time he did it. I didn’t quite believe my ears. He settled in so quickly and was obviously making himself at home.

‘His accent is so strong sometimes that we aren’t sure what he is saying, but it definitely sounds Welsh. And when he says the swear words, that is in a distinctive Welsh accent.’

Basil had previously lived in the Vale of Glamorgan, and his owners had admitted to Mrs Fisk that he had picked up some colourful language.

Proud Polly: Basil the parrot remained true to his Welsh roots by declaring to his new owners: 'I'm in the Valleys'

The mother-of-three adds: 'His previous owners had said he had sworn in the past, but I thought that a change of scenery would leave that behind - not a chance.'

The parrot, originally native to the rainforests of West and Central Africa, then caused Sarah and her husband Adam, 39, even more trouble when he escaped out of a window while they were cleaning his cage.

After launching a missing poster campaign, the couple found Basil safe and well three days later at a nearby vets, where he had a new target for his foul-mouthed rants.

Mandy Stone, veterinary manager at the RSPCA Bristol Clinic, said: ‘He kept calling the nurses t*****s and there were a few other phrases he used that I won’t repeat. It was quite shocking.

The bolshy bird caused more trouble for his new owners after escaping. He turned up at a nearby vets, where he had also targeted nurses with his foul mouth

‘He was very quiet and shy for the first day, but then all of a sudden he started talking and rather surprised us with his adult vocabulary.

‘He also whistled the McDonalds tune and he danced for us when we asked him to, so we forgave his bad manners.’

Despite the nurses eventually coming round to Basil's lewd ways, Mrs Fisk admits the debacle left her red-faced.

She adds: 'I had to apologise for his bad manners when I collected him. It seems that when he is being left on his own away from humans he gets quite angry and swears even more.

‘He doesn’t like to be ignored, especially if you are eating something he likes, like chocolate. He just says ‘chocolate, chocolate, chocolate’ over and over until you give him some. He loves the stuff.

‘He gets quite upset if you say no. He really can be a diva.’
