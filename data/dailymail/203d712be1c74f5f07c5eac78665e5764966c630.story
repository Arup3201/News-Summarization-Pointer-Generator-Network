Have you ever travelled abroad for a relaxing holiday only to spend time responding to work emails or browsing status updates on your mobile phone?

If you thought it was a waste of precious time, you’re not alone.

In an age where it’s becoming increasingly difficult to unplug, a third of Brits say they regret spending too much time on their mobile device while they’re on holiday, a global survey reveals.

Time to unplug: 36 per cent of Brits admit they are reluctant to go on holiday without their mobile devices

Half of all Brits polled admit to checking work e-mails while away and four in 10 say having access to social media is 'very important' to them when they’re abroad.

For some travellers it’s becoming even tougher to leave the smartphone at home.

According to a poll conducted by Hotels.com, 36 per cent of Brits admit they are reluctant to travel without their mobile, placing the UK in a tie for 15th (with Germany) in a ranking of 28 countries.

But when it comes to must-have travel items, a smartphone ranks behind a passport, sunscreen, travel insurance and sunglasses, the study found.

Having the time of our lives: Just under a third of Brits admit to fibbing about their adventures while on holiday

The study analysed the digital holiday habits of almost 2,500 people from 28 countries.

Of those polled in Britain, 83 per cent admit that they try to use their holiday to forget about work.

The survey offers a glimpse into which nations are finding a healthy work/life balance.

It turns out holidaymakers from Thailand are the last prepared to give up their mobile devices with 85 per cent of them saying they can’t travel without one.

South Korea came in second place at 78 per cent, followed by Japan in third at 69 per cent.

The study also looked at which countries are most likely to exaggerate their holiday experiences, with China finishing at the top of the list.

Sixty-seven per cent of Chinese travellers are likely to lie to friends and family when returning home, the poll suggests.

Germany finished second in that category at 64 per cent.

The UK came in 13th place with just under a third of Brits (31 per cent) admitting to fibbing about their adventures, the survey found.

Alison Couper, of Hotels.com, said: ‘Going away on holiday should be a time to take stock and unwind, whether you're lying on a beach in the Seychelles or snowboarding down a mountain in Canada.

‘While smartphones have their plus points while on leave from work, using them to check the weather or view maps, it seems travellers would benefit from switching off their e-mails to disconnect, restoring a little more of the all-important work/life balance.’
