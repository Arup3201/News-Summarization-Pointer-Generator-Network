Two rhinos have survived being drugged while their horns were sawn off using a battery powered hacksaw by poachers.

The white rhinoceros, called Bonnie and 
Clyde, were darted from the air with a powerful drug which left them 
paralysed - but still conscious of what was happening and able to feel 
the horrific pain of the entire episode.

The poachers escaped with more than 15kg of horn, worth about £160,000.

Rare white rhinos Bonnie and Clyde survived the attack in which their horns were removed with a hacksaw

If the horns had been removed 1cm closer to their heads then both animals would have bled to death

The pair were set upon at their home in 
Schotia Game Park, South Africa, with a drug called M99, which is strong enough to kill a man and left
the rhinos unable to even blink.

Keepers said it is the first time they known rhinos to survive such an attack where the horns are separated from their skulls in this way.

The incision was done with an amazing 
amount of precision and just one cut a centimetre further from the horn 
would have seen the rhinos bleed to death.

Head ranger Justin Bean said: 'The horns were really cleanly cut off.

'We
believe the poachers used something like a hacksaw with a very thin 
blade which then gets rid of forensic evidence. There's not much 
shavings or dust left behind.

'Because
we've been monitoring them so well and the police have been so good at 
what they're doing, they've had to resort to being this organised and 
sophisticated.

The animals were darted from the air by poachers who then used a battery powered hacksaw to steal the horns

Bonnie lost her unborn calf after the ordeal and Clyde has been left partially blind and has organ problems

Head ranger Justin Bean (pictured giving medicine) said poachers are becoming more sophisticated

'They can't just run around hacking horns off, it's not that easy for them anymore so they're coming up with new ideas.

'A
serious change is needed, if it carries on as it is now, within ten 
years the species will be extinct. That's the white rhino and the black 
rhino - the rhino species will be extinct.'

Male rhino, Clyde, has been left partially blind with severe kidney, liver, heart and lung damage as a result of the incident.

Bonnie, the female rhino was four months pregnant and the stress of the poaching caused her to miscarry.

Both are now recovering with the help of the medical team at the Investec Rhino Project.

Investec Rhino vet, Dr William Fowlds, said whoever was involved had advanced knowledge and medical training in rhinoceros anatomy

He said: 'When we were first called to the poaching of these two rhino we found Clyde the bull in a very drugged state.

The rhinos were attacked as they grazed at Schotia Game Park, in South Africa, and are now recovering

'He was stumbling around but he was able to walk, he seemed to have use of all his legs which was surprising because the particular drugs that were used to poach these animals are very very potent.

'I have never been called to living animals that have had their horns so neatly removed.

'With these syndicates we know that the level of professionalism is very high because of the amount of organisation that goes behind orchestrating a poaching procedure like this.'

M99 is a powerful paralysing agent that tricks the host into reacting to an infection of all of the major organs.

A darted rhino will produce an extreme amount of white blood cells in a bid to fight the drug.

This causes all muscles and blood vessels to become so saturated with white cells that they body locks up and can no longer function.

Experts fear this new tactic of shooting M99 from the air could spark a new trend amongst poachers.
