It might feature magical ice princesses, mythical trolls and a talking snowman. But Frozen's enchanted storyline hasn't fooled Isabella Tanikumi.

The little-known Peruvian author believes that the fairy tale epic was in fact stolen from her own true-life story - and she is now suing Disney for a staggering $250 million for plagiarizing her work.

According to TMZ, Ms Tanikumi insists that the popular kid's movie was not based on the Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale The Snow Queen, but rather her on her 2010 autobiography about growing up in the Andean mountains in Peru.
