Wanted: This is the unnamed man wanted in connection with the beheading of a swan at 18-acre Bennett's Lake in Hildenborough, Kent

A man is wanted by police on suspicion of beheading a swan and stuffing it in his bag at a picturesque lake.

The unnamed man seen wearing a red jacket, was seen stuffing the lifeless body of a swan into his red and black rucksack at 18-acre Bennett’s Lake in Hildenborough, Kent.

It's not known why the man took the swan, but some locals have speculated that he may have wanted it for his dinner.

The amateur photographer who took the picture of the man allegedly stealing the swan last week, passed it onto his friend, wildlife lover Steve Robinson - who immediately handed it in to Kent Police for further investigation.

Mr Robinson said: 'This b****** is killing swans in the Tonbridge area, here he is after putting one in his bag.'

Mr Robinson said his friend was fishing at the popular lake when he spotted the man apparently attack the swan on March 18, at around 4pm, cutting its head off at the bottom of the neck so it would fit into his rucksack.

The onlooker rushed over to tell the man to stop, but it was too late and the swan had already been decapitated and slung into the rucksack.

The man then ran off when he realised that someone had spotted him.

Kent Police have launched an investigation, but said no arrests have been made.

A spokesman told Mail Online: 'Kent Police is investigating a report that a man decapitated a swan in Tonbridge.

'The incident is believed to have taken place at Bennetts Lake on Powder Mills, between 4pm and 4.30pm, on Tuesday 18 March. Enquiries are ongoing but no arrests have been made.

'The offender is described as aged 20-30 and 5ft 8ins tall. He was wearing a red and black jacket, blue tracksuit bottoms with three black stripes and grey trainers. Carrying a red and black bag.'

All swans in Britain are the property
 of Queen Elizabeth II, who owns all mute swans. In a law dating back to
 the 12th century, swans have been owned by the Royal household who once
 considered them a delicacy.

The swans were marked by a 
royal Swan Marker, a job still in existence, but it now focuses on offering advise to various 
organisations about the welfare of swans and 
vandalism against the bird.
