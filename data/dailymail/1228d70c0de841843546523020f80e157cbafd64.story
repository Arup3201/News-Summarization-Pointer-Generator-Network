A couple got a shock when they noticed their unborn baby’s ultrasound scan looked like the evil galactic overlord from the Star Wars movies, Emperor Palpatine.

Heather Large, 39, was having her 20-week scan with husband Toby, 33, in Pingree Grove, Illinois, when they caught sight of the shadowy Dark Lord apparently lurking inside her womb.

They immediately recognised the image as that of Luke Skywalker's power-hungry nemesis, Dark Side devotee and mentor to Darth Vader, known in later episodes as Darth Sidious.

But fortunately, four months later when the baby, real name Bowie, emerged from the shadows of Heather's uterus, the couple were relieved to find he looked nothing like the malevolent tyrant, played in the films by English actor Ian McDiarmid.

Evil surprise: Mother Heather Large, 39, immediately spotted the seemingly cloaked figure during the ultrasound during the 20th week of her pregnancy and pointed out it looked just like Emperor Palpatine, right.

Toby said: 'During the ultrasound, 
Heather noticed that one of the images appeared to look like Emperor 
Palpatine from Star Wars.

'At this point, everyone in the room had a laugh, including our eight-year-old daughter Hannah and the ultrasound technician.

'At the end of the ultrasound, the tech asked us if we would like to include that image on our take-home CD, since we were so amused.'

Evil baby: Toby only realised the scan of his son Bowie, who is now eight months old, would cause a fuss among Star Wars fans when he uploaded it to his webpage last week

Toby only realised the scan of his son Bowie, who is now eight months old, would cause a fuss among Star Wars fans when he uploaded it to his webpage last week.

Web user ‘MasterGnet’ commented 'The Force is strong with this one! Like it!! Congrats from Switzerland!', while ‘Khz-acid’ write 'Grats on the sith lord baby!'

'And now Heather is both amused and slightly disturbed that images of her uterus are making the rounds on the internet,' added Toby.
