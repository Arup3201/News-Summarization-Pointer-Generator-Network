Police have released nearly 200 images of looters who ransacked a Ferguson grocery store the night it emerged that a grand jury would not indict the officer who shot dead Michael Brown.

The photographs and footage showing 180 suspects were released by St Louis County police on Wednesday to ask the public for help identifying the people inside the store.

The group descended on Dellwood Market on December 24 after authorities announced that Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson would not be charged over killing Brown, 18, in August.

The decision sparked protests and widespread looting across the area, with some people setting fire to vehicles and businesses and raiding their shelves for items.

Looters: Police in Missouri have released images showing people breaking in to a St Louis-area store in November after authorities announced that Darren Wilson would not be indicted for killing Michael Brown

Do you know them? Images clearly show the people breaking into the convenience store on November 24

Destruction: The group broke in after smashing down a flimsy wall and pouring into the store

In the footage, a small group of people can be seen trying to break into the store by yanking the handle and then by using a crowbar to bust down the door.

After two minutes of failing to get into the store, some males smash through a flimsy wall - and suddenly crowds of looters stream inside.

For several minutes, they rush into the store and crowd the aisles, grabbing items and pushing past each other before leaving the store with their arms full.

While some of the looters covered their faces with  masks and others hid behind hoods or hats, many of them are clearly identifiable in the footage. 

It is the third time police have released photos and surveillance video in an effort to track down those responsible for looting in and around Ferguson.

Earlier this month, they released surveillance images from Phillips 66 and so far the public has helped identify five of the suspects, KSDK reported.

Thieves: Some of the looters filled their arms with goods before fleeing and now police are looking for them

About a week later, they released surveillance images from looting at Crazy Deals and Rehoboth Pharmacy.

A dozen Ferguson-area businesses were destroyed in fires and many other businesses were damaged in looting in the hours following the announcement.

It was the third time that Dellwood Market was hit amid the uproar over Brown's killing. It was also targeted in August when looters shot off the locks, entered the store and started a fire.

The store's owner, Mumtaz Lalani, told Fox that he was looted twice in August and it cost him between $50,000 and $100,000 to rebuild after each incident.

He said that following the November attack, he would not be rebuilding his store.
