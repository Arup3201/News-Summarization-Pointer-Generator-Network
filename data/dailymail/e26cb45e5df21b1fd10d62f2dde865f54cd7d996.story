He then made the landscapes even more spectacular by digitally altering the colors.

Larry, 60, from Los Angeles, 
traveled regularly to the area, often standing atop Steptoe Butte, a 
3,612 ft tall monument - the elevation gave him a unique bird-eye view 
of the startling landscape.

The Palouse stretches from Spokane 
to Walla Walla, and is bounded by mountains in Western and Northern 
Washington and Western Idaho.

The landscape, formed during the ice 
age 10,000 years ago, displays three primary colours through the year - 
green in the spring and summer, harvest gold as the wheat ripens in the 
summer and early fall, and reddish brown when the land is being tilled.

While capturing his series of images,
 Larry also focused on the unique old style barns and farming equipment 
used in the area of natural beauty.
