Expecting: Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, pictured in October, have confirmed they are having a baby

Kim, who was sat in the audience during the show, is said to have not known that her man would reveal their pregnancy and was in shock like many of the rappers fans.

She confirmed the news in a message to fans titled 'New Year, New Beginnings' on Monday.

She wrote: It’s true!! Kanye and I are expecting a baby. We feel so blessed and lucky and wish that in addition to both of our families, his mom and my dad could be here to celebrate this special time with us. Looking forward to great new beginnings in 2013 and to starting a family. Happy New Year!!! Xo

The two have been dating for eight months. They have previously denied pregnancy rumours.

Kim is thought to be around the 12-week mark.

Kim, 32, and Kanye, 35, were last seen together on Christmas Day when they attended a basketball game to watch Kim's brother-in-law Lamar Odom play with his new team The Clippers.

Kanye was seen carefully attending to his girlfriend and holding her hand as they sat side by side in the front row. They left at half time, with Kim later tweeting that she felt 'unwell'.

'In bed with the flu all day. Praying this goes away fast!' the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star wrote.

Kim won't be letting her pregnancy get in the way of her work - she is hosting a party in Las Vegas for New Year's Eve at the 1 Oak nightclub.

Kim will earn a six-figure sum for the appearance with tickets costing $125 for entry into the VIP area and $3,000 for a table, according to TMZ.

Of course, Kim is still married to her 
estranged second husband Kris Humphries. The pair's divorce has been prolonged 
as the basketball star has insisted on a court case, claiming the 
marriage should be annulled as it was 'fraud'.

After the news of Kim's pregnancy broke late on Sunday her excited family took to Twitter.

Sister Kourtney wrote: 'Been wanting 
to shout from the rooftops with joy and now I can! Another angel to 
welcome to our family. Overwhelmed with excitement!'

Kanye spent the Christmas period with Kim's family, who have welcomed him with open arms.

Kim has also become close to Kanye's family after being he took her to visit them in Oklahoma City while visiting his mother Donda West's grave last month. 

Since Kim and Kanye began dating in April they have rarely been apart.

Despite the shortness of their relationship, the two have been friends for years.

It has even been speculated that the rapper had been in love with Kim back in 2009, when he appeared to refer to her in his track Knock You Down.

At the time the song was penned, Kim was in a relationship with NFL star Reggie Bush, whom she went on to date on and off for three years.

The song includes the lines: 'You was always the cheerleader of my dreams... To seem to only date the head of football teams... And I was the class clown that always kept you laughing... We were never meant to be, baby we just happened.' 

He then goes on to rap: 'You should leave your boyfriend now.'

And in December 2010, Kanye was on hand when Kim filmed her music video Jam (Turn It Up).

In scenes later broadcast on her reality show Kris Jenner was seen jokingly criticising Kanye for eyeing up Kim, telling him: ‘Don’t be looking at her a**’.

Not one to miss a beat, quick-witted Kanye replied: ‘I’ve never seen it actually.’
