Two British women are under arrest in Brazil after attempting to smuggle £170,000 worth of cocaine to the UK.

The 23-year-olds hid 7.7lbs of the class-A drug in their suitcases and tried to board a flight to Britain.

Police detained the pair after sniffer dogs detected the drugs at a boarding gate at San Paulo Airport on Monday morning.

Detectives opened their luggage to find the cocaine hidden in in small plastic bags within the lining of their cases.

Last night the unnamed women were being held in a nearby jail ahead of an appearance before an investigating judge.

They face between 20 and 25 years in jail if convicted of drugs smuggling.

Police said the women have told them they bought the cocaine in the city of Rio Branco, the capital of the Amazon state of Acre which serves as a major conduit for cocaine trafficking from nearby Peru.

The border city was the launch pad in Brazil for lethal cocaine derivative oxi, dubbed the drug of death, which contains chemicals including kerosene and battery fluid and kills most users within a year.

A spokesman for Brazil's Policia Federal said: ‘The PF has arrested two British women trying to board a flight to London with 3.5 kilos of cocaine.

‘They were stopped at the boarding gate after sniffer dogs detected the drugs in their luggage.

‘A number of small plastic bags containing the cocaine were hidden in the lining of the suitcases which according to the women, were acquired in the city of Rio Branco.

‘The suspects are now being dealt with by the judiciary who will be investigating them on suspicion of drugs trafficking.

‘They face a prison sentence of between 20 and 25 years if convicted.’

San Paulo's Guarulhos International Airport, the airport where the women were arrested, is the main exit point for people carrying cocaine from South America to the rest of the world.

An average of five people a day are arrested for drugs trafficking.

Less than a decade ago, only 40 foreign women were imprisoned in the entire state of San Paulo.

But the number of arrests of foreign women has risen so dramatically that all such prisoners have moved to the San Paulo Capital Jail for Women where, at more than 400, they account for more than half the prison's population.

Brits Kimberley Anderson and Sasha Brooks were seized at Guarulhos airport in May 2009 with 5kg of cocaine.

Kimberley's mum Trudy Anderson, from Nottingham, has spoken of the appalling conditions she is being held in.

She told after one visit to see her how was sharing a cramped cell with three other girls and had to use a bucket as a toilet in front of the other prisoners and sleep on the floor because of the limited bed space.

Sasha, talking to the BBC in December 2009, said: ‘I was in debt, I needed money.

‘I just came across some guys who happened to do this kind of thing and was persuaded and told everything would be all right.

‘No amount of money in the world can give you back your freedom, your family.

‘Here you don't have love, you don't have freedom, you don't have anything.’
