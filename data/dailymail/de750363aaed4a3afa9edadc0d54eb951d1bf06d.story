The case of a fisherman who was left dead at sea after his boat was attacked by a rival three-man fishing crew was 'murder for lobster,' his murder trial was told.

The body of Phillip Boudreau, of Cape Breton in Nova Scotia, Canada, was never found after he went out on his speedboat in Petit de Grat harbour in June last year - at the height of lobster season.

Joseph James Landry denies second-degree murder. 

But on the first day of his trial at Nova Scotia Supreme Court in Port Hawkesbury yesterday, prosecutor Steve Drake declared: 'This case is about murder for lobster.

'Not a momentary lapse of reason…James Landry carried out a sustained attack.'

'Murder for lobster': The court was told that fisherman Philip Boudreau, pictured, was killed in Petit de Grat harbour over shellfish

The court heard Joseph James Landry launched a 'sustained' attack. He denies second-degree murder 

Mr Drake told jurors that Mr Boudreau, aged 43, died after an attack by a lobster-fishing crew on a boat from the area called the Twin Maggies - that included Landry. 

He explained that the crew on Landry's boat saw Mr Boudreau near their lobster traps off the and the Twin Maggies charged at his smaller, open boat.

The court heard deckhand Craig Landry was told to load a rifle. 

He added: 'You will hear through witnesses Landry using his own words, 'Get him … Kill him'.' 

The court also heard Joseph James Landry, 67, of Little Anse, aimed a rifle at Mr Boudreau and hit him in the leg after the crew of three men took deliberate aim at his boat - ramming into it three times. 

The boat capsized and Mr Boudreau disappeared. 

Three others have been charged in the death of Mr Boudreau. 

Dwayne Matthew Samson, of d'Escousse, who is the captain of the boat, also faces a second-degree murder charge. 

His wife Carla Samson, the owner of the lobster boat, who is also Joseph Landry's daughter, also faces a charge of accessory after the fact. 

Deckhand Craig Landry faced a second-degree murder charge at first - which were later withdrawn. 

He now faces a charge of accessory after the fact. 

Nova Scotia Supreme Court, pictured, heard Mr Boudreau left his Cape Breton home on his speedboat in June last year but he never returned

Craig Landry told police that Mr Boudreau, who was wounded, clung to a gas can floating in the water after his boat capsized. 

Joseph James Landry hooked him with a fishing gaff, reported the National Post.

At one point, Mr Boudreau freed himself only for Landry to hook him again. 

The crew then tied an anchor to his neck and arms and dropped him in deep water.

According to Craig Landry, Joseph Landry then said 'That's deep enough', and the crew then continued fishing.

A bullet recovered from Mr Boudreau's boat came from a gun that was later found at Dwayne and Carla Samson's home. 

Jurors heard that diving teams, as well as helicopter crews and the navy, spent more than a week looking for the fisherman's body. 

All that was recovered was a  teal baseball cap on the shore near the Petit de Grat harbour, which is believed to be Mr Boudreau's.
