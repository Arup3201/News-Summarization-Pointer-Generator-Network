Amanda Moss' 7-year-old daughter, Kylee, is 3-foot-10 and weighs only 54lbs, but according to her elementary school, she is overweight.

Moss, from Belton, Missouri, said she was outraged when Kylee came home from Hillcrest Elementary School last Friday with a letter from her physical education class stating that her body mass index was too high for her weight and height.

‘She is tiny. She has no body fat at all,’ Moss said of the slender, bespectacled second-grader.

Lifestyle tips: The note made recommendations for more exercise and healthier snacks 

The note also included recommendations for more physical activity and healthier snacks.

The mother told the station KMBC when Kylee read the note on the bus, she instantly became concerned about her weight and body image.

‘She goes, “Does this mean I'm fat?” and I said, “No, this does not mean you are fat,"’ Moss recounted.

The parent said the school should have sent the note home in a sealed envelope to avoid making children feel self-conscious.

Heidi Hicksam, whose 10-year-old son, Kaleb, also attends Hillcrest Elementary, was equally despondent when she got the note indicating that her son's BMI was above average.

Hicksam said to Fox4KC Kaleb suffers from a liver disease, and the family did not need a letter reminding them of his health struggles.

Students at Hillcrest elementary School in Missouri recieved the notes last Friday after being weighed in and measured by PE teachers 

Body mass index is calculated by multiplying a person's weight by 703 and dividing the result by the height. Age and gender are factored in when determining BMI parameters.

According to a chart included in the note from the school, a 7-year-old girl's healthy BMI should fall between 13.5-17.5. Kylee's index was 17.9. 

'They send home a piece of paper that says, "Here is a box. Your child doesn't fit into it. Here is what you should do to fit into the box,"' her mother fumed.  

Belton Superintendent Andrew Underwood said the letters are sent home to parents every year to promote a healthy lifestyle as part of a county-wide program called Healthy Hillcrest.

Underwood insisted that it was not the school's intention to be malicious towards students. Going forward, parents will be notified of the weigh-ins in advance and will get the chance to opt out.
