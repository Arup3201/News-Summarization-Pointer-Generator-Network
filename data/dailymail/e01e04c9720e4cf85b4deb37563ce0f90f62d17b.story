Manny Pacquiao has decided to take a break away from his preparations for his upcoming fight against Floyd Mayweather by taking part in a basketball match between Kia Carnival and Talk 'N Text.

Kia's player-coach took part in his side's shock 106-103 win against Philippines basketball giants Talk in Manila.

Pacquiao and his team-mates were pictured with several boxes of Pizza Hut before the basketball showdown as they relaxed in the locker room ahead of the match.

Talk's players towered above the 36-year-old, who stands at just 5ft 6½ ins, however that did not deter Pacquiao from giving his all.

Pacquiao is set to feature against Blackwater Elite on Saturday before flying to Los Angeles to step up his preparations for his upcoming mega-fight against Mayweather on May 2.

The 36-year-old, speaking after his side's win, said Kia will be able to cope without him during his time in America as his assistants 'know what to do'.

Pacquiao trained at a gym in General Santos City, located in the Philippines' southern island of Mindanao, on Monday.

The 36-year-old will travel to America to step up his training after representing Kia on Saturday

He previously took to Twitter to say: 'I am very happy that Floyd Mayweather and I can give the fans the fight they have wanted for so many years.

'I dedicate this fight to all the fans who willed this fight to happen and, as always, to bring glory to the Philippines.'

Sky are said to be favourites to screen the fight in the UK despite stiff competition from BT, ITV and Box Nation.
