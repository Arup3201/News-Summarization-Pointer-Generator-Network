A fresh supermarket price war on the forecourts is underway with giants Asda and Sainsbury's cutting up to 3p a litre from the price of fuel.

The retailers said the new charges would come into effect tomorrow.

The slash follows April’s record high petrol prices, which pushed the price of filling a family car to £100.

Slashed: Supermarket giants Asda and Sainsbury's are cutting up to 3p a litre from the price of fuel. The retailers said the new prices would come into effect tomorrow

The cuts mean that filling a typical car will be the cheapest since February 2011, according to  experts. 

Asda said an ease in global oil prices has enabled it to pass those savings on to motorists.

Transport Secretary Justine Greening said the Government would be prepared to introduce new laws to control prices

Drivers filling up at any of Asda's 195 forecourts nationwide will now pay no more than 129.7p per litre for unleaded and 134.7p per litre for diesel.

Andy Peake, Asda's director of petrol trading, said: 'Motorists will be pleased to know fuel is now at the lowest price in over a year as prices have fallen 11p since their peak in April.

'Unlike other retailers, our price cuts benefit everyone across the country, meaning that no-one filling up at Asda will be forced to pay a premium for their fuel.'

A Sainsbury's spokesman said: 'From tomorrow we will be cutting petrol and diesel prices in our petrol stations by up to 3p per litre. Sainsbury's is committed to delivering great value and helping customers cut down on cost wherever possible.'

A spokesman for the AA welcomed the cuts, saying that motorists would be getting a 'good price' for fuel.

But the cost 
of petrol looks set to rise again in the summer - in August the 
Government has planned 3.02 pence per litre rise in fuel 
duty.

The move to pass on lower prices to 
drivers comes after a warning from Government that it was looking at 
ways to ensure petrol retailers do not delay price cuts when wholesale 
costs fall.

Two weeks ago, Transport Secretary Justine Greening said companies should develop a code of practice to stop the 'indefensible' practice of petrol companies raising prices at the pump as soon as wholesale petrol and oil prices rise, only to delay lowering them again when costs fall.

She said the Government would be prepared to introduce new laws to bring about the change if companies failed to come up with a code of their own.
