Secret celebrity crushes are a secret no more after a new survey revealed the nation's most coveted fancies.

Topping the list for the men were the formidable Dragon's Den star Deborah Meadon, followed by Vicar Of Dibley star Dawn French, with Princess Beatrice third and Former This Morning host Fern Britton fourth.

Curvy Ex-EastEnders star Natalie Cassidy came fifth and as for the women, celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, funny men James Corden and David Mitchell topped the polls.

Dragon's Den star Deborah Meaden and TV funny woman Dawn French topped the list as men's secret celebrity guilty pleasure

Controversial television host Piers Morgan was fourth and Eddie Izzard was fifth.

Yesterday, a spokesman for Iphone app Celebalike, who carried out the research, said: 'We're flooded with images of people that conform to traditional "Hollywood" notions of beauty, but it isn't always about looks.

'The results show many Brits have a secret celebrity crush that they would be less keen to voice or feel others wouldn't agree with them about.

'That shows that there's more to attraction and it seems a strong personality or authority plays a part, with Deborah Meaden and Gordon Ramsay proving popular.'

The Celebalike app works using a complex algorithm through a computer program that performs high-performance face identification and facial feature recognition.

And it means men may be able to find their own Deborah Meaden - the dragon has been matched nearly 80,000 times since the app launched.

As for the women, it was celebrity foul-mouthed chef Gordon Ramsay who took the crown and James Corden was also a favourite

While, according to the app results, there are also 73,527 James Corden look-alikes out there and 24,444 Piers Morgan doppelgangers.

Three quarters of Brits admit that they are attracted to a celebrity that wouldn't really be classed as good-looking in the traditional sense.

And six in ten people have a crush on a celebrity that they think other people wouldn't be able to understand.

In fact, a quarter of Brits have been attracted to a celebrity without really knowing what it is about them that they like so much.

Of course the Brads and Angelinas of this world are always going to be held up as sex symbols, but many people have a soft spot for people who don't conform to the traditional stereotypes, said a spokesperson

The Celebalike spokesman added: 'Of course the Brads and Angelinas of this world are always going to be held up as sex symbols, but many people have a soft spot for people who don't conform to the traditional stereotypes.

'It's reassuring to see that we aren't always consumed by the perfect images of celebrity and that those people that are a bit more 'real' are still able to win our hearts.

'Unfortunately for most of us, we can't emulate the standard of beauty shown to us in the media, but the celebrities on this list are a lot more down to earth in their appearance, and that's reflected by the number of Celebalike matches people like Deborah Meaden have.'
