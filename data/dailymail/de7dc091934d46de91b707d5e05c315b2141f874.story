Tim Rice has said he may no longer vote for the Tories because of David Cameron’s enthusiasm for ‘hideous’ wind farms.

The lyricist said that he could have made more than £1million from offers to put turbines on his Scottish estate, but believes green energy schemes are a ‘scam’.

Sir Tim, 68, who was once a high profile support of the Conservative Party, said its wind-farm policy has made him unsure how he will vote.

‘Wind farms are one of the most dishonest scams perpetuated by any organisation ever,’ he told Country Life.

‘They don’t work, are hideous to look at, destroy birds and bats, are bad for people’s health and put up people’s bills.

He added: ‘We have some land in Scotland and we were asked to put wind turbines on it. I could have made £1million or more out of it with all the grants and so forth- it is an absolute racket.’

The UK is currently signed up to a legally binding European Union renewable energy target requiring it to produce about 15 per of its energy from renewable sources by 2020.

Sir Tim’s criticism came as a Church of England bishop said no more wind farms should be allowed in the countryside as they are a ‘blot’ on ‘God’s creation’.

Scam: Sir Tim reveals he could have made £1 million from wind turbines on his land in Scotland, but has dismissed the renewable energy initiative as an 'absolute racket'

Bishop of Newcastle the Right Reverend Martin Wharton said he has a Christian duty to protect the beautiful landscapes in his diocese from ‘becoming marred and disfigured’.

Breaking ranks with an unofficial consensus within the Church strongly favouring wind energy, the 69-year-old said there are ‘critical questions’ about if turbines will even reduce carbon emissions.

In a letter to a local newspaper, the bishop said that having spent time touring his diocese, which included Northumberland, he had been unable not to notice the growing number of wind farms.

‘It is a basic Christian truth that we all have a duty and a responsibility to care for and exercise wise stewardship over God’s creation, which has been entrusted to us,’ he wrote.

‘Our countryside needs to be protected and preserved for ourselves, for our children and for our grandchildren as a place of refreshment and renewal for the spiritual health and wellbeing of us all.

‘The danger is that in parts of Northumberland, our landscape is becoming marred and disfigured and turned into one industrial site after another.’

Referencing the Northumbrian saints such as Bede, Cuthbert and Hilda in his letter to the Newcastle Journal, he continued: ‘We are blessed to live in an area of outstanding natural beauty.

‘We enjoy a wonderful physical and spiritual heritage in this land of the Northern Saints.

‘Is now not the time to say “enough” to any further blots on our landscape? Please remember above all that “The earth is the Lord’s, and all that fills it” Psalm 24.’

He added: ‘Whilst we all recognise the need for a greater reliance on sources of renewable energy, there are critical questions to be asked not only about the efficiency of wind turbines in general but also about the massive environmental impact that the significant growth and cumulative effect that wind farms are having in Northumberland.

‘There is no evidence that I have seen that suggests that wind farms will ever provide the reliable, controllable energy that is required by our society, however many there might be.

‘Furthermore some studies have even suggested that far from reducing CO2 emissions, wind farms actually increase them.’

Sir Tim, who co-wrote Jesus Christ Superstar, Evita and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat with Andrew Lloyd Webber, owns the 33,000-acre Dundonnell estate in Wester Ross on the west coast of Scotland.

The Oscar-winning songwriter is worth £149million according the Sunday Times Rich List.
