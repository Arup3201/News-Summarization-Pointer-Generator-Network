Five generations of the real-life 12 Years a Slave protagonist, Solomon Northup, have been reunited in three U.S. cities.

The Hollywood Reporter brought together 47 family members from Rochester, New York, Los Angeles, California and Washington, D.C., who all share a deep pride of their ancestor's incredible odyssey.

Seeing their forefather's harrowing tale writ large in Steve McQueen's 2013 film was moving, but difficult, for the racially-diverse group.

'Growing up hearing the story and then 
seeing it gave me mixed feelings,' 15-year-old Milan Linzy of Valencia, 
California, said. 'I was upset because of what happened, but excited that I finally
 got to see this real thing.'

Solomon Northup was a free-born African American from New York, the son of a freed slave.

In 1841, he was kidnapped and sold him into slavery. He tried to escape from the clutches of various plantation owners over 12 years, before he finally he got news to his family, who contacted friends and enlisted the Governor of New York, Washington Hunt, to his cause.

He regained his freedom in January 1853 and returned to his family in New York.

Northup recorded his incredible tale in a memoir which was adapted for the 2013 film 12 Years a Slave.

For Leonard Holton Jr., 28, a fourth great-grandson of Northup, watching the visceral depiction of slavery on the big screen was confronting.

'It was hard to watch, knowing it was someone who had a hand in creating me,' he said.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, many in Northup's direct lineage have known about their 
ancestor's story from an early age.

Several return to his hometown of Saratoga 
Springs, New York, annually for the city's Solomon Northup Day, which just 
celebrated its 15th year.

Their ages range from 72 to just 10-months-old.

'There are people in our family who are very strong, and I think they get that from Solomon's side,' Rebecca Bicksler, a white 
fifth-generation descendant who lives in upstate New York, said.
