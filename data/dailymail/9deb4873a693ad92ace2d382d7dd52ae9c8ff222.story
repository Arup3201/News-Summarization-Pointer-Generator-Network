The brother and wife of online celebrity gun enthusiast Keith Ratliff, who was found dead shot once in the head, say the victim likely knew his killer.

‘For him not to pull out that gun and try to defend himself, he had to feel comfortable around somebody,’ his brother Kelly Ratliff told ABC News affiliate WSB-TV. ‘Either that or he was ambushed.’

‘You know, it just doesn't really add up,’ said Amanda Ratliff, who lives in Lexington, Kentucky, with their 2-year-old son.

Found dead: Authorities found Keith Ratliff, 32, dead at his office in Carnesville, Georgia, on January 3 with a single bullet wound in the head

Local authorities in Carnesville, Georgia, found Mr Ratliff dead at his office on January 3 with a single bullet wound in the head. His corpse was reportedly surrounded by several guns, but not the gun that killed him.

‘We are interviewing people of interest, but we have not named a suspect,’ Franklin County sheriff, Stevie Thomas, told the New York Times. ‘We are not ruling out any options.’

Mr Ratliff, 32, was last seen alive at 7pm on January 2, authorities said.

The news of his death quickly spread across the Internet where his videos had grown in popularity. 

His YouTube channel, FPSRussia, became the site’s ninth largest, with nearly 3.5 million subscribers and more than 500 million views as of January 2013.

The online channel features dozens of videos of Mr Ratliff’s friend Kyle Myers acting zany as he fires rifles, machine guns and rocket launchers, rides choppers and tanks and blows things up.

Quiet shooter: Neighbors in Carnesville said the Kentucky-bred gun enthusiast kept to himself

Following Mr Ratliff’s unexpected death, fans on Facebook and Twitter said they were surprised that such a well-armed expert had not been able to defend himself.

The online video producer had recently moved from Kentucky to Carnesville, a city of 540 people, where he opened his business, FPS Industries, which made and repaired firearms.

He was licensed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, authorities said.

Mr Ratliff was a vocal advocate for all Americans having access to firearms, including assault weaponry.

Neighbors in Carnesville said the Kentucky-bred gun enthusiast kept to himself.

Prior to his death, a local sheriff said he was called to his property only once, after neighbors reportedly heard gunfire.
