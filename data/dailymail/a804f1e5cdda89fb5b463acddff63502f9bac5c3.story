Marie McKinlay, 40, pictured arriving at court, is alleged to have run a high-class escort agency called Allure

A brothel madam used the profits from her £500,000-a-year business to put her two children through private school, a court heard yesterday.

Marie McKinlay allegedly employed 25 high-class prostitutes able to offer clients everything from ‘girlfriend experience to porn star experience’.

They charged as much as £300 an hour and £1,500 for overnight bookings that had to ‘include some sleep’.

McKinlay’s online escort agency was no more than a front for a prostitution racket, London’s Southwark Crown Court was told.

The 40-year-old rented a £1,500-a-month apartment in central London where clients could romp with two girls from a roster with names such as ‘Sophie Sweetness’ and ‘Beth Angel’.

She is said to have made more than £350,000 in profits from the racket in three years.

When the officers who arrested her told her what her earnings were she claimed to be shocked but said the money had ‘put two of her children through private school and paid her £1,500 monthly rent’.

Edmund Vickers, prosecuting, said: ‘Marie McKinlay ran an internet escort agency which provide prostitutes at what could be described as the high end of the market, the expensive end, for clients who were willing to pay £300 or more an hour for sexual services.

‘She interviewed and recruited the girls, she uploaded their details to the website – not only their photos but the services  that each girl offered and their prices – she dealt with the clients, and she organised the girls’ bookings.

‘She charged the girls 30 per cent commission on all the takings, which made her a small fortune.

‘In less than two-and-a-half years between December 2008 and May 2011, when one looks at her bank account, one can see she received cash deposits totalling something over £350,000.

'You will see that when the defendant was arrested, for the period from January to June 2011, she had already made over £90,000.’

When McKinlay was detained at her 
home in Southampton in July 2011 police seized a diary which recorded 
‘the names of the working girls and the amounts owed by each girl for 
each day of the year’.

In interview in December 2011 
McKinlay admitted setting up the agency and said her ‘ambition’ was that
 it should become ‘a top or elite agency’ and that she had 25 girls on 
her books.

She admitted to officers that she had
 rented the flat in London Bridge but had been forced to cancel the 
contract in August 2010 as ‘the girls had used it for too many late 
night parties’.

Mr Vickers added: ‘The defendant was 
responsible for putting in services provided by each of the girls that 
could range from French kissing to what is described as girlfriend 
experience to porn star experience.

‘The Crown say there can be no doubt that this was prostitution and that the defendant was controlling it.’

McKinlay, of Lewisham in South-East London, denies controlling prostitution for gain and converting criminal property.

The trial continues.
