A pair of grandmothers have been banned from taking their mobility scooters into a town's shopping centre after they were accused of stealing a packet of kitchen rolls.

Bosses at the Britannia Centre, in Hinckley, Leicestershire barred Lillian Clarke and Margaret Yates, labelling them a 'nuisance' after Mrs Clarke, 75, left a branch of Wilkinsons without paying for the paper towels.

The grandmother of four says she had placed the rolls in the bottom of her scooter and had forgotten to pay for them, returning with the money the following day.

Trouble: The ban came into place after Mrs Clarke left the centre's branch of Wilkinsons without paying for the paper towels. She returned to pay for them the following day, only to be banned on her next visit

'I went back to pay for them the next day when I realised,' said Mrs Clarke, a widow with three children.

'But next time I went to go in with Margaret we were accused of stealing.

'I went to get two scratchcards and as I came away from the till the manager came up to me and said that I was barred.

'Then the next thing is we are barred from the whole of the Britannia Centre.'

Mrs Clarke said she was told by a staff member at centre that she and Mrs Yates were 'a nuisance on their scooters'.

Defiant: Mrs Yates has dubbed herself the Silver Lady following the dispute with the shopping centre

Divorcee Mrs Yates, 71, who has two children and three grandchildren, said: 'This ordeal has made me ill. I suffer with my nerves as it is and it upsets me that I can't go there to do my shopping.

'We go to all the shops in there and everyone loves us. We've not done anything wrong.'

Mrs Clarke admitted trying to enter the Britannia Centre - despite the ban.

She said she called into the centre's Argos branch to pick up a catalogue, but was 'chased out of the centre'.

She added: 'The man that chased me was like a peeping Tom - hiding around the corner and then he just chased me. I can't go anywhere at all.'

Still welcome: Mrs Clarke and Mrs Yates  have refused to let the ban get them down, and are still welcomed elsewhere on the high street

The friends have refused to let the ban get them down, and are still welcomed elsewhere on the high street in their mobility scooters emblazoned with signs for their alter-egos - the Silver Lady and Scarlet Woman - and heart-shaped badges on the back, advising: 'Love is all you need.'

Mrs Yates added: 'We used to spend a lot of money at the Britannia Centre. It's a good job we don't have to pick up our medication from the chemist there.

'We go to Morrisons now.'

Phil Wheeler, manager at Britannia Centre, said the ban against Mrs Clarke and Mrs Yates must remain in place.

He said: 'This applies to anyone - if someone is caught shoplifting from any of the shops in the centre they will be automatically banned.

'If they try to come back into the centre when they are banned, technically they are trespassing.'

A spokesman for the Britannia Centre added: 'We cannot comment on individual cases but we always consider all of the facts and, where necessary, we do not hesitate to impose a ban on those who take goods from our stores without paying.'
