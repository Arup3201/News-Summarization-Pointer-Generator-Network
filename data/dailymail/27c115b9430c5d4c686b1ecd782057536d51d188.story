'Messiah': Unification Church leader Rev. Sun Myung Moon has died at the age of 92

The Rev Sun Myung Moon, the self-proclaimed messiah who turned his Unification Church into a worldwide religious movement and gained fame and notoriety in equal measure for his mass weddings, has died.

The 92-year-old famously befriended North Korean leaders as well as U.S. presidents.

He died on Monday at a church-owned hospital near his home in Gapyeong, north-east of Seoul, according to church officials.

His death came just two weeks after being hospitalised with pneumonia, Unification Church spokesman Ahn Ho-yeul said.

Moon's wife and children were believed to have been at his side.

His youngest son, the Rev. Hyung-jin Moon, was named the church's top 
religious director in April 2008 and will now lead the movement.

Moon, who was born in a town that is now in 
North Korea, founded his religious movement in Seoul in 1954 after 
surviving the Korean War.

He
preached new interpretations of lessons from the Bible and made 
headlines in the 1970s and 1980s for holding mass weddings of thousands 
of followers.

The ceremonies
often included couples from different countries, whom Moon matched up 
in a bid to build a multicultural religious world.

The church was accused of using 
devious recruitment tactics and duping followers out of money, while 
parents of followers in the U.S. in particular expressed worries that 
their children were brainwashed into joining.

The church responded by saying that many other new religious movements faced similar accusations in their early stages.

In later years, the church adopted a 
lower profile and focused on building a business empire that included 
the Washington Times newspaper, the New Yorker Hotel in Manhattan, 
Bridgeport University in Connecticut, as well as a hotel and a fledgling car manufacturer in North Korea.

It
acquired a ski resort, a professional soccer team and other businesses 
in South Korea, and a seafood distribution firm that supplies sushi to 
Japanese restaurants across the U.S.

These, and other, lucrative ventures are at the heart of Hyung Jin Moon's takeover of the church's leadership.

The Unification Church founded in Seoul in 1954, performed its first mass wedding in 1961 with 33 couples and went on to host many more, including this one in 2010

Increasingly influential over the 
last few years, his leading role in the church has nevertheless failed to offset
divisions in the Moon family over what to do with the movement's 
substantial business portfolio.

His siblings are more interested in pursuing the family's business interests than getting involved with the church.

Dr George Chryssides, of Birmingham University, 
recently told the BBC: 'If you look at the history of religious 
movements, the person who gets the assets is key to how the organisation
develops.'

The
Unification Church claims millions of members worldwide, though church 
defectors and other critics say the figure is no more than 100,000.

In
2009, Moon married 45,000 people in simultaneous ceremonies worldwide 
in his first large-scale mass wedding in years. Some were newlyweds and 
others reaffirmed past vows.

He married an additional 7,000 
couples in South Korea in February 2010. The ceremonies attracted media 
coverage but little of the controversy that dogged the church in earlier
decades.

Born in 1920 in 
what is today North Korea, Moon said he was 16 when Jesus Christ called 
upon him to complete his unfinished work.

While preaching the gospel in North 
Korea in the years after the country was divided into the 
communist-backed North and U.S.-allied South, Moon was imprisoned in the
late 1940s for allegedly spying for South Korea - a charge Moon 
disputed.

He quickly drew young followers with his conservative, family-oriented value system and unusual interpretation of the Bible.

He conducted his first mass wedding in Seoul in the early 1960s.

The
'blessing ceremonies' grew in scale over the next two decades, with a 
1982 wedding at Madison Square Garden in New York - the first outside 
South Korea - drawing thousands of participants.

'International
and intercultural marriages are the quickest way to bring about an 
ideal world of peace,' Moon said in a 2009 autobiography.

'People should marry across national and cultural boundaries with 
people from countries they consider to be their enemies so that the 
world of peace can come that much more quickly.'

Moon
began rebuilding his relationship with North Korea in 1991, when he met
the country's founder Kim Il Sung in the eastern industrial city of 
Hamhung.

Moon said in his autobiography that he
asked Kim to give up his nuclear ambitions, and that Kim responded that
his atomic program was for peaceful purposes and he had no intention to
use it to 'kill my own people.'

'The
two of us were able to communicate well about our shared hobbies of 
hunting and fishing. At one point, we each felt we had so much to say to
the other that we just started talking like old friends meeting after a
long separation,' Moon wrote.

He
added that he heard Kim tell his son: 'After I die, if there are things
to discuss pertaining to North-South relations, you must always seek 
the advice of President Moon.'

When Kim Il Sung died in 1994, Moon sent a condolence delegation to North Korea, drawing criticism from conservatives at home.

Kim's son and successor, Kim Jong Il,
sent roses, prized wild ginseng, Rolex watches and other gifts to Moon 
on his birthday each year.

Kim
Jong Il died late last year and was succeeded by his son Kim Jong Un. 
Moon sent a delegation to pay its respects during the mourning period 
for Kim Jong Il.

Moon also 
developed good relationships with conservative American leaders, 
including former Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W.
Bush. Still, he served 13 months at a U.S. federal prison in 1984-1985 
for tax evasion.

The 
church says the U.S. government persecuted Moon because of his growing 
influence and popularity with young people in the United States, his 
home for more than 30 years.

As he grew older, Moon quietly handed 
over day-to-day control of his multibillion-dollar religious and 
business empire, which included dozens of companies ranging from 
hospitals and universities to a ballet troupe, to his children.

His
youngest son, the Rev. Hyung-jin Moon, was named the church's top 
religious director in April 2008. Other sons and daughters were put in 
charge of the church's business and charitable activities in South Korea
and abroad.

After ending a
first marriage, Moon remarried a South Korean, Hak Ja Han Moon, in 
1960. She often was at Moon's side for the mass weddings.

The
youngest son told The Associated Press in a February 2010 interview 
that Moon's offspring do not see themselves as his successors.

'Our
role is not inheriting that messianic role,' he said. 'Our role is more
of the apostles, where we share ... where we become the bridge between 
understanding what kind of lives (our) two parents have lived.'

Moon is survived by his second wife and 10 children.

Although best known for conducting mass weddings involving thousands of couples, Moon was at least as good at attracting dollars as converts.

His church amassed lucrative business ventures over the years, including the Washington Times newspaper, Manhattan's iconic New Yorker Hotel, and a seafood distribution firm that supplies sushi to Japanese restaurants across the U.S.

It gave the University of Bridgeport $110 million over more than a decade to keep the Connecticut school operating, while in South Korea it acquired a ski resort, professional soccer teams, schools, hospitals and other businesses.

Moon, who apparently has 10 surviving 
sons and daughters, had hoped to help bring about the reunification of 
Korea during his lifetime.

His church operates the Potonggang Hotel in Pyongyang, jointly operates the North Korean automaker and has a huge 'peace' institute in the North Korean capital.

And yet he also developed a good relationship with conservative American leaders such as former Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.

One of the more bizarre chapters in Moon's relationship with Washington came in 2004, when more than a dozen U.S. lawmakers attended a 'coronation ceremony' for Moon and his wife in which Moon declared himself humanity's savior and said his teachings have helped Hitler and Stalin be 'reborn as new persons.'

Some of the congressmen later said they had been misled.

Moon also served 13 months at a U.S. 
federal prison in the mid-1980s after a New York City jury convicted him
of filing false tax returns.
