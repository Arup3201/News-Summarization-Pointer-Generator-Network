A game warden has captured amazing footage of two deer with their antlers trapped around a pole.

Warden Michael McCall was on patrol in Comal County, Texas, when he spotted the distressed animals who appeared to have become entangled in some rope.

The white tailed deer then became caught either side of a metal pole and could not free themselves.

The warden decided to film the scene as he attempted to free the animals as, although the deer are common in the area, the predicament was quite unique.

Mr McCall approaches in his car and can be seen trying to figure out how to get close enough to free the deer without accidentally being gored by them.

Eventually, the warden decides to sit on the hood of his car and lean down to saw through the rope while staying out of harm's way.

The agitated deer were seen tugging at the rope entangled around their antlers 

Mr McCall said he gets called out to at least a few incidents a week involving animals at Comal County.

But the chance to help out gives him great job satisfaction.

He explains: ' It is law enforcement off the pavement; Texans helping Texans in conservation enforcement since 1895.'

Mr McCall  cut the animals free without putting himself in danger by balancing on the hood of his truck

Mr McCall says he became a Game Warden to 'help that which has no voice of its own, our cultural and natural resources'.

Luckily for the rescuer, the deer seem to pleased to be free of the rope attaching their antlers that they sprint off at the end of the video without even a glance back.
