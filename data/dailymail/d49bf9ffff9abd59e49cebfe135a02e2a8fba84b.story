Yaya and Kolo Toure both started for Ivory Coast in their crucial Group C showdown with Greece just days after the death of their brother.

Ibrahim Toure, a 28-year-old player 
with the Lebanon-based Al Safa, died in Manchester on Thursday. He had 
been suffering from cancer.

Reports had claimed the brothers would leave Brazil to be with their family, but the duo have vowed to play on in a bid to help their country reach the last 16.

VIDEO City didn't let me visit my dying brother - Toure

Ivory Coast's player wore black armbands in tribute to Ibrahim.

Yaya Toure has suggested that Manchester City did not offer him sufficient support during a period which he describes as 'the hardest in my life.'

He told France Football: 'At the end of the season, I wanted to stay for four or five days with my brother before I flew to prepare for the World Cup with Ivory Coast, except that City did not want to grant me a few days.

'I went to celebrate the title championship in Abu Dhabi while my brother was lying in his sickbed. By fortune, Kolo was at his bedside. After that I blame myself for not insisting and for not making them respect me.

'However, club officials knew very well that I was suffering for a few months as the health of my brother declined. This is the reason I had several injuries at the end of the season, because my head had taken control of my body. These last four months have probably been the hardest in my life.Â
