A black man filmed the moment a white homeowner pulled out a gun as he approached him outside his home.

The man, Demetrius Taylor, of St. Paul, Minnesota, claims he was sitting in his car with a friend, who is black, as they discussed him selling his car to the man, when they noticed the white homeowner taking photos.

Taylor walked over to confront the man, filming as he approached, and that is when the white homeowner can be seen holding a gun in his hand.

'You just pulled a gun on me!' Taylor says on the video. 

'For no reason at all... that's crazy, that's crazy.'

The white homeowner seems unfazed however, justifying his actions by saying; 'We have a lot of drug dealing going on... no one is stereotyping.'

This is a woman starts yelling at the men from across the street, and asking if the homeowner would like her to call 911 on Taylor.

'You saw two black guys having a conversation in the car and you started taking pictures,' Taylor goes on to say in the video. 

'When you see me walking down this street, because I'm black, you got nervous and you pulled out your gun.'

In the end, both men ended up calling 911, and authorities were able to come and diffuse the situation

In the end, both men ended up calling 911, and authorities were able to come and diffuse the situation according to Fox 9. 

Neither of the men decided to file a report at the time, but Taylor apparently changed his mind after that according to police and will be making a report.

'In my personal opinion, had I been Caucasian, had I been Mexican or Asian, he wouldn't be taking pictures,' said Taylor. 

What's more, Taylor, who said he has never before interacted with this man, spoke to some neighbors who he claims said; 'It's not the first time he's done this, he's done it before.'

The homeowner never pointed the gun at Taylor and was on his property at the time, so may not have broken any law.
