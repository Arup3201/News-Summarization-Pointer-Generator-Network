A Connecticut man who assaulted acclaimed Irish author Colum McCann last month outside a hotel after the author tried to help the man's wife following a domestic dispute has been charged.

Michael Mott, 34, of Oxford was charged with assault in the June 28 incident outside the Study Hotel in New Haven.

Mott confessed to assaulting McCann, 49, and turned himself in Monday evening, police said. They declined to elaborate.

McCann, the author of 'Let the Great World Spin,' was treated for significant facial injuries at Yale-New Haven Hospital.

Witnesses suggested McCann had tried to help a woman who was involved in a dispute in the hotel lobby, police said.

Police said Mott had a dispute with his wife after hotel staff told the couple the credit card Mott used didn't have sufficient funds to pay for the room.

‘What we 
believe happened is that the victim tried to intercede in what appeared 
to be a domestic dispute between a man and a woman,’ Assistant Police 
Chief Archie Generoso told the New Haven Independent last week. ‘He saw a woman pushed to the ground. He tried to assist the woman.

‘He asked the woman if she wanted him to call the police. 
He urged her to do so. She said she didn’t want to call the police. The 
guy said, ‘It’s your decision.’ He turned around, began to walk away, 
and he was assaulted.'

McCann went outside where he was attacked, police said. Police say Mott punched McCann, who lost consciousness.

Mott was also charged with family violence breach of peace for the altercation in the lobby, police said.

'This was a particularly disturbing case because Mr. McCann was specifically targeted after he tried helping another victim,' Chief Dean Esserman said in a statement.

McCann ended 
up with a concussion, a broken cheekbone and some broken teeth from the 
'shocking, cowardly attack in broad daylight on a busy street,' he told 
the Irish Times in a statement.

First responders arrived to find McCann on the sidewalk bleeding from the head, police told the Independent.

He was taken to the hospital, released later that night and returned home to New York City.

‘I was trying to help someone out,’ his statement said. ‘I was cold-clocked without warning. I had a severe concussion, a broken cheekbone, some broken teeth and a spirit that has been temporarily bruised.

‘But I am recovering quickly and I’ve been overwhelmed by the generous response from friends and strangers alike.’

He credited an nearby off-duty paramedic with rushing to his aid as his attacker fled the scene.

McCann told the Times he was in New Haven to attend a conference on empathy at Yale University for Narrative 4, a non-profit organization he is involved in. He was forced to pull out of an event because of the attack.

Where it happened: McCann was knocked out on this sidewalk just outside The Study, a hotel just off campus

‘I suffered a few injuries but nothing that can’t be quickly healed,’ he continued.

‘If anything, I was shaken out of the ruts of my ordinary perception, and I have been struck the genuine caring nature of people asking about how they can help out.’

The award-winning author then used the opportunity to call attention to ‘others who suffer far worse violence.

‘It could have happened anywhere in the world. The fact that it happened on the edge of one of the world’s foremost colleges campuses simply highlights how prevalent this sort of situation is,’ said McCann.

New Haven, where Yale University is located, does have an above-average crime rate, but it is not as common for attacks like this to occur on or near the campus.

McCann is home recovering and should be back to normal within a few weeks.

McCann is 
from New York City. He just released the story 'Gone' through the online
 publisher and subscription service Byliner. It's his first short story 
in a decade. He has written six novels, including 
2011’s 'Let the Great World Spin' – which earned him international acclaim
 and several awards including the International Impact Award and many 
other honors.
