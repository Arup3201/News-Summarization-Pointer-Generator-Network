Robbie Williams incurred the wrath of Led Zeppelin rocker Jimmy Page over plans to revamp his mansion - and now he's upset M&S heir Mr Sieff

He is used to the adoration of pop fans – but when it comes to neighbours, Robbie Williams is having the opposite effect.

The Angels singer has already incurred the wrath of Led Zeppelin rocker Jimmy Page over plans to revamp his £17.5 million London mansion.

And now the former Take That star has upset Marks & Spencer heir Jonathan Sieff.

Mr Sieff has written to Kensington and Chelsea Council to complain about Williams’s request to install air conditioning units at the bottom of his garden, which backs onto Mr Sieff’s property.

The great-great grandson of Mr Marks is worried the machines’ noise will detract from his quality of life. 

He wrote that the three units together will produce a constant sound of 43.5dB, ‘which is nearly the same comparison as an adult speaking’.

He added: ‘My garden is only 90 sqm and from the location of the units to my kitchen doors is 9.5 metres so why should I have someone else’s noise affecting my surrounding property, where the applicant in question can put the condenser units anywhere the applicant wishes on his property as it is vastly bigger.

‘If the resident would like to install the condenser units, I would grant the applicant permission to install them but nowhere near my property so it doesn’t affect my family from going outside, enjoying the garden from some tranquillity and freedom from disturbance.’

He is also worried about the disturbance that might be caused to local residents if the proposed works on the nineteenth century property are given the green light.

Mr Williams, 41, bought the 46-room mansion in the Holland Park area from the late film director Michael Winner in 2013. He lives in the property, called Woodland House, with his wife Ayda Field, 35, and their two children.

He first submitted plans to modernise the home in early December last year, claiming he wanted to create a ‘contemporary standard of family living.’

However, Mr Page,who has lived in the neighbouring Tower House for four decades, quickly submitting an objection to the assorted proposals, which included building a recording studio, partly filling a swimming pool and adding a window overlooking his garden.

In a letter to the council, the veteran rocker wrote that he was ‘extremely concerned’ the works would create an eyesore and might even damage his own Grade I listed property.

He added: ‘I have been responsible for the protection of the Tower House for over 40 years and I am always concerned when proposals are made for nearby properties which may be detrimental to the wellbeing of this important heritage asset.’

However, rather than backing down, Williams upped the ante by submitting another tranche of planning requests, which would see him build a 3,600sq/ft basement – complete with swimming pool – under his back garden and a ‘like for like’ replacement of a first floor balcony.
