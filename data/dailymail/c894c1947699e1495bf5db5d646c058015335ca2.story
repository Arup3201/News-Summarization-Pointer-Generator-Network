The Royal Bank of Scotland is in danger of failing within the next decade and putting the British taxpayer's £45 billion stake at risk, a new study has claimed.

The book, by financial expert Ian Fraser, warns there is a £100 billion 'black hole' in the disgraced bank's finances despite the massive bailout it received.

Fraser blames 'five broad areas of alleged criminality and wrongdoing' and said Gordon Brown and David Cameron's governments failed to reform it properly.

Disgraced: Fred Goodwin, the former Royal Bank of Scotland chief executive who was at the helm when the bank needed a massive bailout

RBS, which had a bonus pool of £900million last year, brought the UK to the brink of financial ruin under the stewardship of Fred 'The Shred' Goodwin in autumn 2008.

Since then RBS has been at the centre of a string of scandals that have cost the bank – still 81 per cent owned by taxpayers – billions in fines and settlements.

It has already paid out £2.2 billion on PPI loan insurance, £750 million for interest rate swaps and £390 million for its role in the Libor scandal and some £60 million for violating US sanctions.

In Shredded: Inside RBS, The Bank That Broke Britain, Fraser wrote: 'The result has been that, at the time of writing, RBS is probably a worse bank than it was under Fred Goodwin.

'If the right moves are now made, RBS could become a great bank again. If they're not, I doubt it will even exist in 10 years' time.

'Whatever happens, it now seems impossible that British taxpayers will ever see a return on their £45.5bn investment in the bank.'

Fraser claims Goodwin, who in 2012 was stripped of the knighthood given to him by Gordon Brown, squandered billions of pounds on overpriced acquisitions, fleets of Mercedes and extravagant buildings and decor.

The book alleges that Goodwin and his wife, Joyce, avoided tens of thousands of pounds in personal tax liabilities over their repeated use of a controversial £20 million Dassault Falcon 900EX private jet bought by RBS in 2002, The Independent on Sunday reported.

The book also claims most senior RBS executives dreaded going on the plane with Goodwin because of his lack of social skills.

Fraser quotes one former RBS insider who criticised the amount of money the bank spent on sponsorship of Formula One motor racing.

He described it as 'a vanity thing for Fred and because he liked motor sport'.
