Two Texas teachers are building a home made of Styrofoam that's as sturdy as bricks and could withstand the huffs and puffs of a Big Bad Wolf. 

According to Shannon and Lesa Cockrell of Hudson, Texas, their 1,400-square-foot house could survive winds of 200 mph. The entire project will cost less than $100,000 to build.

A similar wood-frame house would cost $150,000, they estimate.

'We decided this is something we want to do,' Shannon Cockrell told KTRE-TV.

'To one: help our environment, and two: to make it economically possible for all of us to afford housing. It's safer, it's more secure [and] you get better energy efficiency.'

DIY: High school teachers Shannon and Lesa Cockrell are trendsetters by building their home out of Styrofoam instead of brick

Just like LEGOs: The blocks are assembled the same way one would imagine building with LEGOs; teeth from the top of the block slide into slits at the bottom of another block

Mr Cockrell and his wife, Lesa, are teachers at a high school in town, but Mr Cockrell believes that despite careers that may not be ideal for a Do-It-Yourself home building project, they are still confident that they can build the walls in virtually no time.

'My wife and I are not contractors and we are not home builders at all and we can have these walls built in about a week, week and a half,' he said.

The home, of course, isn't made entirely of styrofoam. Concrete is poured into the hollow styrofoam blocks and becomes the actual structure of the house.

The outside of the blocks are coated with stuccos, waterproofing finishes, drywall or siding. The Cockrells plan to add a stone finish.

Before the styrofoam sandwich is made, however, the hollow blocks are stacked on top of each other like LEGOs - teeth from the top of the block slide into slits at the bottom of another block.

The Texas couple is working with Utah-based SmartBlocks, a supplier of styrofoam blocks for residential and commercial properties.

Cost-effective: The Cockrells plan on building the 1,400-square-foot house for less than $100,000 and hope to finish in November

The Cockrells said the fact that SmartBlocks is owned by disabled American veterans is another reason they sourced from them.

The Cockrells may be on to something, too. The Styrofoam is becoming an ever-more popular building material, Mike Trolle, a member of the Connecticut Green Building Council, told The Stamford Advocate earlier this year.

Insulated concrete foam -- ICF -- has been around for decades, but it's still a phenomenon in the residential space, he said.

One drawback, however, is the loss of space to the numerous layers of wall that go into supporting, decorating and protecting the styrofoam, according to architecture blog Architangent, which explored the 'hidden costs' of ICF.

Hard to tell: This otherwise nondescript home in Idaho was built with the same Styrofoam system used by the Cockrells

'The disadvantage of this type of construction is the overall wall thickness; ICF walls tend to be very thick, and total wall assemblies (the structure plus interior finish and exterior cladding) can be upwards of 14 inches thick,' according to the blog. 'It is easy to see that choosing ICF means giving up some interior space to the wall.'

The Cockrells said they hope to open their doors in late November.

'My wife and I, both of us teach, and we're always telling our kids do something different, make a difference in something," Mr. Cockrell told KTRE.
