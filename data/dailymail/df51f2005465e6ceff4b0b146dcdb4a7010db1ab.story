Your washing might smell fresh but don't be lulled into a false sense of cleanliness.

The move away from the high-temperature washes and harsh detergents of our grandmothers’ era may be kinder to fabrics, the environment and sensitive skin but it could costing us our health.

Research has shown that potentially harmful bacteria in our laundry is not being killed off in low-temperature washes, turning the average spin cycle into a breeding ground for germs.

How clean is your laundry? Scientists say today's gentle washing methods create a 'bacteria soup' for clothes to swish around in and spread contagious bugs such as E.coli and Salmonella

The levels of bacteria found by microbiologists in our washing machines 
and on supposedly ‘clean’ laundered clothes has led leading hygiene 
expert, Dr Lisa Ackerley, to call for an increased awareness of what is 
being termed the ‘Sick Laundry Cycle’.

Dr Ackerley said: 'Consumers believe that normal laundering produces ‘clean’ clothes but this does not necessarily translate to ‘hygienically’ clean.

'The trend towards reducing washing temperatures and water volumes alongside using gentler detergents has affected the efficacy of the laundering process for reducing bacteria on contaminated clothing. It’s time to re-evaluate the hygiene of our laundry.'

Do at least one cycle without any clothes in the machine at 90°C once a month to spring clean the interior of the appliance.

Wash
 bed sheets or underpants and socks in a separate wash from face 
flannels and tea towels - especially during a low-temperature wash.

Don’t shut your machine door immediately after a wash. Let it air to reduce the growth of bacteria inside.

Regularly
 clean your washing machine’s door seals and detergent drawer and wash 
your hands thoroughly after handling heavily soiled laundry.

If
 washing at low temperatures without a laundry disinfectant then always 
wash your hands after you take wet items out of the machine.

In fact a microbial assessment to evaluate the infection risks associated with laundry found an estimated average of 0.1g grams (10,000 organisms) of faecal matter on every pair of ‘clean’ knickers.

The Sick Laundry Cycle isn’t just about the inadequate removal of bacteria from contaminated clothes. Cross-contamination also plays a part.

'If you put something ridden with bacteria in the washing machine you will simply be swishing the germs around - creating a ‘bacterial soup’ - unless you do something to kill them.

'I am very concerned about bacteria from soiled underwear transferring onto items such as tea towels which are then used to wipe dishes,” says Dr Ackerley.

Items that are most likely to be 
contaminated with pathogens are those which come into direct contact 
with the body - underwear, towels, facecloths, bedlinen and nappies.

Bacteria
 lurking inside washing machines can also be responsible for 
cross-contamination: 'Studies have shown that a build-up of bacteria in 
the interior of the washing machine transfers to the wash water of 
subsequent cycles – with as many as one million bacteria found in just 
two tablespoons of wash water.

Bacteria from soiled underwear and dirty dishrags have been shown to get distributed to other pieces of clothing in the laundry load

'Low-temperature washing provides optimal conditions for germs to breed and multiply in favourite hideaways such as the detergent drawer and door seals,' explained Dr Ackerley.

In particular, the Sick Laundry Cycle is a problem if someone in the house is ill.

Segregating clothes, bedding and towels infected by a bout of sickness from the rest of the household laundry isn’t enough to stop the risk of spreading infection if you are handling items washed at low temperatures.

Dr Ackerley warned: 'Bacteria on wet clothes are more likely to contaminate hands. Thetransfer of germs from hands to objects in the home and ultimately our mouths is thereforea risk.

'By increasing our understanding of why bacteria are not always removed in the washingmachine, how they can cross-contaminate and the simple everyday steps needed toprevent potential sources of infection, the Sick Laundry Cycle can be broken.'
