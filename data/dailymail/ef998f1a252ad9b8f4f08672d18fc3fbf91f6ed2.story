Adam Lallana is ready to play through the pain barrier to help revive Liverpool’ s season at Old Trafford.

The England international didn’t figure in Tuesday’s 1-1 draw with Basle after he broke two ribs during the 3-1 win at Leicester seven days earlier.

Lallana had played against Sunderland last Saturday with the aid of a pain-killing injection and will do the same against Manchester United.

Lallana sustained two broken ribs during Liverpool's 3-1 win against Leicester City 

It has been a stop-start season for Lallana, who cost Liverpool £23.7million when he arrived from Southampton in June, as he missed the first four weeks of the campaign after damaging his knee ligaments.

Mario Balotelli, meanwhile, has an outside chance of being involved at Old Trafford after he returned to training at Melwood on Thursday.

Balotelli has not played for Liverpool since November 8 because of a groin problem sustained on international duty.
