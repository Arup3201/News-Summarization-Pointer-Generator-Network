Alastair Cook's increasingly desperate run search has not gone unnoticed by England’s opponents in the upcoming Test series, and yesterday India batsman Virat Kohli piled more pressure on the home side’s troubled captain.

England’s opening batsman will start Tuesday’s first Investec Test at Trent Bridge under more intense scrutiny than at any point since taking over from Andrew Strauss in 2012.

After beginning his captaincy tenure with five hundreds in nine Tests — including 562 runs at an average of more than 80 in leading his side to an historic series win in India — Cook’s flatlining form has coincided with an alarming slump in his side’s fortunes.

Without a hundred in 24 Test innings, and following successive series defeats to Australia and  Sri Lanka, Kohli believes the  captaincy is weighing heavily on the 29-year-old’s shoulders.

‘Cook was batting brilliantly when he came to India (in 2012) and he made full use of that,’ Kohli said.

‘Obviously, right now, things have been pretty difficult for him. Everyone goes through that phase where they don’t score runs, but because he has the captaincy as well that might be troubling him.

‘We know he’s a quality player and he can come back at any  time. We’d like to keep him under  pressure and get him out early, because the English batting has revolved around him for the last few years.

‘He’s going to be a big player in this series and we’d like to get him early to get momentum.’

Cook retains overwhelming  support within the England dressing room and yesterday received more backing from one of his  senior lieutenants, Stuart Broad.

After supporting Cook to the hilt following the winter’s 5-0 Ashes whitewash, and sacking Kevin  Pietersen in the process, senior  figures at the ECB have much to lose if he fails to deliver.

But defeat at Trent Bridge and a failure to make a significant contribution with the bat would surely leave Cook on the brink.

‘He is our highest scorer of hundreds ever and he has not got one for a year so he’ll be desperate to get back on that wagon,’ Broad said. ‘We all know the quality he has.’

Heavy hitter: England are expected to recall fit-again Ben Stokes for the Test series against India

While his batting form speaks for itself, Cook’s tactical acumen has also been questioned, with his apparent reluctance to go for the jugular costing England on more than one occasion.

This week at Trent Bridge  England are expected to recall their most exciting prospect with fit-again Durham all-rounder Ben Stokes — one of the few England players to return from Australia with his reputation enhanced — likely to return at the expense of Chris Jordan.

Stokes fielded at third slip alongside Ian Bell and Cook in practice yesterday and his impressive bowling form for Durham in recent weeks, allied to his proven batting record, should see the 23-year-old return for the first time since he broke his hand punching a locker in Barbados last March.

‘Ben has the X-factor and is a maverick,’ said his Durham coach Jon Lewis yesterday. ‘He has the ability to change a game faster than any other player I’ve known and that makes him stand out. He is a competitor in every sense of the word. He has the ability to make things happen.’

Stokes’s return would see  England take the field boasting nine batsman with Test hundreds to their name.

Centurion: Stuart Broad leaves the field after hitting 169 runs against Pakistan in 2010

Broad, who made three figures against Pakistan at Lord’s in 2010, would bat at nine, though his bowling will be more useful during a five-Test series packed into 42 days.

The 28-year-old has been hampered by patella tendinitis over recent months and he, along with England’s other fast bowlers, are likely to be rotated at some point in the series.

‘We’ve got a great opportunity to play a lot of cricket for  England in the next five or six weeks, but we will have to look after our bodies,’ he said.

‘It’s an annoying phone call you get from the selector that you’re missing out the next game because you’re being rotated, but I think it is pretty sensible.’
