Like everyone in the boxing world I cannot wait to see Floyd Mayweather fight Manny Pacquiao. I’m not sure yet whether I will make the trip – for travelling fans, the tickets will be like gold dust but more expensive.

I am not part of the promotion and yet I have still had hundreds of calls from people asking for tickets. I have heard some interesting rumours on this one. Some people are saying tickets could trade for as much as £100,000 for ringside. I have also heard rumours that no tickets will go on general release to the public.

I desperately hope that is not the case. Boxing needs to stay accessible even though this is an extraordinary fight with an unmatched ability to make money. It will generate hundreds of millions whichever way they sell it.

On the fight itself, I think it will be compelling. People will say it should have happened years ago but I still think it is a great match-up. The general feeling is that Floyd will win by a wide unanimous decision. I’m not totally convinced by that.

I think Floyd will win, but it could be close. The one thing that Floyd won’t like is Manny’s speed. He will put Floyd under tremendous pressure and in those circumstances anything can happen. It might even lead Floyd to let go of his punches more frequently and perhaps even force a stoppage. I can see that happening, though my instinct tells me he will win on points.
