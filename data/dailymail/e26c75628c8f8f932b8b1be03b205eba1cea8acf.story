The Prime Minister will re-introduce a Bill committing whoever is in government to holding a vote by 2017 later this year

David Cameron must start from scratch in his attempts to pass legislation guaranteeing a referendum on Britain’s EU membership after it was killed off by Labour and the Liberal Democrats yesterday.

The Prime Minister will re-introduce a Bill committing whoever is in government to holding a vote by 2017 later this year.

He suggested he would use the Parliament Act to force the plans into law against the wishes of the House of Lords, where peers voted last night by 180 to 130 to end the debate.

The Conservatives attacked Labour and
 the Lib Dems as ‘enemies of democracy’ for their stance, insisting the 
majority of voters want a say on the Europe issue.

But
 some ministers privately doubt the wisdom of the Prime Minister’s 
backing for the Bill. Its failure risks confusing voters after his 
public pledge to hold a referendum by 2017 if he remains in Downing 
Street.

And amid 
growing signs of trouble for Mr Cameron’s plans to renegotiate looser 
ties with Brussels before an in/out vote, Francois Hollande yesterday 
publicly rebuffed hopes of fundamental EU reform yesterday by telling 
him it was not a ‘priority’.

The
 French president used a summit between the two countries to tell the 
Prime Minister that the EU ‘cannot be expected’ to follow the example of
 just one country.

Mr
 Cameron hit back, making it clear that he wants to see changes to the 
EU’s fundamental treaties before the 2017 vote. But he said he would 
hold the referendum whether or not he gets substantial changes.

The
 Prime Minister had ordered all Conservative MPs to back the Private 
Members’ Bill, introduced in the Commons by Tory backbencher James 
Wharton, which would guarantee a referendum.

In
 a highly unusual move, a three-line whip – the strongest possible 
instruction – was imposed on Tory MPs, meaning any members of the 
Government who voted against would have had to resign.

The
 legislation cleared the Commons with a big majority but last night, 
after Labour and Lib Dem whips met to agree tactics, it was effectively 
killed off as peers voted to end debate.

UKIP leader Nigel Farage and Tory backbencher James 
Wharton who introduced the private members' bill on a European referendum criticised Labour and the Lib Dems for derailing the legislation

As well as opposition peers, crossbenchers voting against the Bill included Lord Hannay and Lord  Kerr – both former British ambassadors to the EU.

Mr Cameron said last night: ‘Today the Labour Party in the House of Lords voted to block our Bill that would have ensured a referendum on Britain’s EU membership by the end of 2017.

‘This is disappointing news for all of us, but we are not going to give up in our efforts to turn our referendum commitment into law. Far from it. After all, we succeeded in passing it through the House of Commons – a huge achievement.

‘We are going to try to re-introduce the same Bill in the next session of Parliament and, if necessary, rely on the provisions in the Parliament Act to stop Labour and Liberal Democrat peers killing the Bill once again.

‘Irrespective of these attempts, the Conservative Party remains absolutely committed to giving the British people their say in  a referendum.’

At their meeting at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire Mr Hollande told Mr Cameron that change to EU treaties was 'not a priority for the time being'

Mr Wharton, the MP for Stockton South
 who brought forward the Bill at the behest of the Tory leadership, 
said: ‘Labour and the Lib Dems have conspired in the House of Lords to 
kill this important piece of legislation, doing the bidding of their 
political masters in the Commons.’

Conservative HQ went further, branding Labour and the Lib Dems ‘enemies of democracy’.

UKIP
 leader Nigel Farage said: ‘The Labour Party have once again 
demonstrated just how much they do not want ordinary people to have 
their say on the EU.’

Douglas Alexander, Labour’s Shadow Foreign Secretary, said: ‘The House of Lords today has once again raised serious questions about the Prime Minister’s approach towards such a serious constitutional matter.’

As Mr Cameron and Mr Hollande met at RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire to discuss plans for greater defence co-operation between Europe’s two largest military powers, Mr Hollande said change to EU treaties was ‘not a priority for the time being’.

‘France would like the UK to remain within the EU,’ he said, adding that he wanted a ‘more efficient’ and ‘better integrated’ eurozone, but that any amendments to the text of treaties were not urgent.
