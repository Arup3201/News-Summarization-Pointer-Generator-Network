Meet Wilbur, the charismatic sea lion with one impressive hidden talent.

TheÂ Florida-based marine mammal may well be the next Picasso with his artistic gifts, which he uses to regularly entertain visitors at the Theater of the Sea facility in Islamorada.

Sea lions are known for their friendly dispositions and ability to perform trained behaviours, but painting is something that hasn't been often seen before.

Gripping the paintbrush with his mouth, the sea creature paints abstract art to the delight of visitors

Each day, Wilbur eagerly grasps the paintbrush with his mouth and gets to work, urged on by his encouraging trainers.

For those hoping to share inspiration with this adorable sea creature, rest assured that the Theater of the Sea does offer regular 'paint with a sea lion' sessions.

Theater of the Sea has been open since the 1940s and acts as a rescue and rehabilitation organisation, as well as a park.

The park currently houses injured sea turtles, crocodiles, and approximately 40 cats, as well as this very talented sea lion.

Still, there's no denying that Wilbur is the star showman of the facility.
