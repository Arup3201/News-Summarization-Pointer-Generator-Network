Russian air traffic controllers have been blamed for the plane crash which killed Polish President Lech Kaczynski and 95 others.

A Polish report has stated they gave incorrect and confusing landing instructions to pilots - and has put further strain on the relationship between the two neighbours.

But it also heavily criticised Polish officials and procedures, and has seen the immediate resignation of Defence Minister Bogdan Klich - whose department oversaw the training of the crew of the doomed flight.

Fatal: The plane carrying Polish president Lech Kaczynski crashed near the Smolensk airport killing everyone on board

Today's report challenges a Russian aviation commission report, published in January, that put sole blame for the disaster on Polish officials.

That report struck Poles as an attempt to avoid any responsibility for the plane crash in heavy fog at a rudimentary airport near Smolensk.

Since then Poland has eagerly awaited its own experts' report.

They hoped it would create a more balanced picture of the crash on April 10, 2010, which killed dozens of senior officials along with the president and first lady, in the worst Polish disaster since World War II.

As key causes of the crash it cites wrong positioning of the plane during attempted landing, due to insufficient training of the pilots to fly the plane, a Tupolev-154.

It also said there was a lack of proper cooperation among the crew and an overly slow reaction to an automatic terrain warning system that warned pilots they were flying too low.

Incorrect information from the airport control tower on the plane's position prevented the crew from realizing they were making mistakes, it added

Jerzy Miller, the interior minister and head of the investigation commission, said at a presentation today: 'There was no single cause, but an accumulation of causes led to the crash.'

In Moscow, deputy chairman of Russia's State Duma's foreign affairs committee, Andrei Klimov, said he believed the Polish pilots were to blame and lashed out at Warsaw for what he called politicizing the investigation.

He said: 'This report is not a technical, but a political one. The results were compiled with a nod to the political situation in order to show that Russians were to blame for at least something.'

Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Klich submitted his resignation Thursday evening, knowing that the report would point to mistakes in the military training of pilots and flight procedures.

He described Klich as an honourable man who did not want to burden the government.

General elections are scheduled for this autumn and Tusk's centrist party, Civic Platform, hopes to hold onto power.

The Polish plane crashed when Kaczynski and his delegation were on their way to honour some 22,000 Polish officers killed during World War II by Stalin's secret police, a crime known as the Katyn massacres.

The symbolism of the plane disaster occurring on a mission to remember the dead added another layer of Polish national grief and resentment in the weeks and months after the crash.

At first it seemed the accident had helped Poland and Russia heal some of their historic wounds, because an outpouring of sympathy by Russians was met by Poles with much gratitude.

But the Russian report again strained relations, adding to a lingering sense of aggrievement in Poland.

Poles remain bitter about the Katyn massacres, the Soviet Union's occupation of Poland's eastern half during the war and Moscow's domination of Poland during the Cold War.

Right-wing groups have promoted conspiracy theories, with some saying they believe Russians killed Kaczynski and the others by producing artificial fog that blinded the pilots.

Miller said there was no artificial fog at the Smolensk airport that day.
