Growing up in 1960s Liverpool and it would have been hard not to get swept up in Beatlemania. 

But now a digital image expert has brought the Fab Four up to date by superimposing them into today images of their home town. 

Mike Price merged old photographs of John, Paul, George and Ringo with present day scenes to create these fascinating montages spanning half a century.

Now and then: The Beatles once again take The Cavern Club by storm. This early image of the band shows George, Paul and John with drummer Pete Best playing in the original Cavern Club - which was demolished in 1982 - montaged with a modern picture of the rebuilt Cavern Club - which opened two years later

His father, also called Mike who remembers Liverpool in the 1960s well, helped his son recreate the images.

Mr Price said: 'Over the last few months I’ve done a series of 'then and now' pictures.

'My dad is great. He remembers everything in great detail - where everything was and what all the shops were called.

'It’s harder than it looks getting the angles right in each photo.

'I have to take a copy of it with me and try to stand in the exact same spot for the ‘now’ photograph as the photographer must have been for the ‘then’ image.

'Then it’s a case of trying to match the two images up in Photoshop. It’s nice to think of the history in each image as I’m putting it together.

'Liverpool is so rich in local history that there’s inspiration around every corner.'

In 1981 plans were revealed to excavate the buried remains of the Cavern Club cellar.

It would form part of a £7million redevelopment project of the former warehouse site of 8-12 Mathew Street which had housed The Cavern Club up until its closure in 1973.

The original club was knocked down in 1982 but more than 15,000 bricks from the building were saved and used to rebuild the premises using the same plans. The Cavern re-opened in 1984.

Today the club occupies 75 per cent of the first site but is deeper, meaning revellers now descend 30 steps compared to 18 steps in 1962.
