It is a collection so diverse it contains adverts for Chelsea buns, plans for a bathing machine that creates a grand personal swimming pool in the sea and hastily scribbled designs for a grand palace with opulent staircases but no doors or windows.

The thousands of papers collected by King George III reveals the personality of a King who was at once a proud father, eager architect and ruler with a tendency to distrust in his own ministers and want to make his own decisions.

The collection of King George III has revealed 60,000 documents including drawings produced by his daughters, sensitive political documents and plans like this one drawn by the King himself which shows four opulent staircases and no means of entry and is likely to have been produced by him during a manic episode

The 60,000 papers which make up he collection also reveal the monarch had a propensity to hoard documents, possibly as a form of therapy during severe bouts of mental illness and manic episodes he suffered that led him to become known as the Mad King.

The monarch painstakingly collated the documents throughout his time as ruler and is believed to have stored it next to his bedroom in what is now Buckingham Palace.

'This collection reveals a number of things about King George III,' said Peter Barber, head of map collections at the British Library which is cataloguing the huge haul of documents. 

'First of all it shows his human side as a proud and doting father. It contains drawings of Frogmore and Windsor Castle produced by his daughters as well as a military plan drawn up by his favourite son at the age of 13. 

 'They are the sort of items that any proud father would keep. 

'It also shows a person who is very interested in his country and wanted to learn about his people. He collected adverts for Chelsea buns and wire railings.

The collection contains plans for a bathing machine used by the monarch to bathe in the sea in Weymouth 

King George III built up the collection of images and maps himself, storing them at Buckingham Palace 

'And lastly it shows how he saw his role as King and felt it was important to reach his own decisions.' 

The collection contains sensitive and secret government information about English fortifications that would have been seen by the King but would usually have been returned to his ministers - indicating an innate distrust in his colleagues by the monarch who preferred to make his own decisions.

It also betrays his keen interest in architecture, with many maps and plans from across the world, including his own scrawled designs. 

King George III was interested in maps and collected thousands like this  plan of Kingston Upon Thames

The ruler kept a number of documents himself as he wanted to make his own decisions rather than be guided

 King George was interested in the development and architecture, keeping plans like this of Southwark 

One of the papers features his plans for a palace at Kew, drawn in his characteristic enthusiastic but 'slightly obsessive' hand.

Mr Barber added: 'If George had not been King he would have been an architect. He loved drawing plans for buildings. This collection contains two plans, one in pencil and the other one is rather savagely done. There are all sorts of strange things contained in the plan, which was probably for a large palace he was planning to build at Kew Gardens. 

'It was probably produced during one of his manic episodes. It's got four staircases whereas the greatest of rulers at this time was usually satisfied with just one. It also does not seem to have any entrances.' 

A map of the Thames was found among 60,000 documents in the collection showing an interest in the country

Detailed maps were a key part of the collection and it is estimated to take around two years to catalogue 

Mr Barber said one of the most unique things about the collection was that the monarch built it up and used it himself, unlike his collections of scientific instruments and books which he left to his assistants to manage.

It reveals the personal side of the King - particularly in plans for a bathing machine, popular with prudish Victorians who wanted to swim in the sea without anyone seeing them. 

King George III ruled from 1760 to 1820 

The King's bathing machine was particularly large, allowing him to bathe naked in the sea at Weymouth in his own form of private swimming pool without ever being seen.

As well as the scrawled plans and legal documents the collection also contains thousands of maps, showing the interest of the ruler in the rest of the world - despite the fact he only travelled as far as Weymouth. 

'He was an armchair traveller,' said Mr Barber. 

'He didn't actually travel further than Weymouth but through books and maps he eagerly learnt about the rest of the world and was able to do a grand tour of Italy.

'George probably didn't travel far because he was a conscientious leader and didn't want to be away from his work for too long.'

Amongst the dozens of papers are also items the monarch is likely to have inherited, such as a 'birth certificate' for New York. 

This was likely to have been presented to the Duke of York in 1664 after it was captured by the English from the Dutch and renamed from New Amsterdam. 

He also collected early images of Canada and plans for churches in East London. 

Some of the items produced and collected by the King are likely to have been put into the collection when he suffered episodes of mania. 

Mr Barber added: 'The 1780s and 1790s were very hard years for George as he had lost the American colonies and had these really very severe attacks of mental illness. 

King George III is widely referred to as the 'Mad King' after suffering episodes of mania during his reign. 

He reigned from 1760 to his death in 1820 - one of the longest reigns by any British monarch in history.

The eldest son of Frederick, Prince of Wales, and Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, George succeeded his grandfather George II at the age of 22, becoming the third Hanoverian monarch to reign. 

He was the first Hanoverian to speak English as his first language and to be born in the country.  

He is most remembered as the king who lost the American colonies and went mad and was famously depicted in Nicholas Hytner's 1994 The Madness of King George.

But according to the Monarchy's official website, George's direct responsibility for the loss of the colonies is not great. 

He opposed their bid for independence to the end, but he did not develop the policies (such as the Stamp Act of 1765 and the Townshend duties of 1767 on tea, paper and other products) which led to war in 1775-76 and which had the support of Parliament.

King George III reigned from 1760 to 1820 

The King suffered serious bouts of illness in 1788-89 and again in 1801, George became permanently deranged in 1810.

During his episodes he frequently withdrew to Kew Palace leaving the country in crisis about who was to rule in his absence. 

In the last decade of his reign he was declared mentally unfit to rule and his eldest son - the later George IV - acted as Prince Regent from 1811. 

Some medical historians have said that George III's mental instability was caused by a hereditary physical disorder called porphyria. This has a number of symptoms including blue urine. 

However researchers at the University of London recently came up with a theory that his mania was caused by mental illness. 

They analysed his letters and speech, which were known to be so long the monarch would sometimes foam at the mouth. 

The monarch would sometimes have to be held to the floor by his assistants when he suffered convulsions.   

'I think this collection was probably a sort of therapy, allowing him to escape from all of his weaknesses.' 

The British Library is cataloguing and digitising the collection and estimates due to its size the process could take two years. 

It is appealing for the public's help in funding the project. For more information see http://support.bl.uk/Page/Unlock-London-Maps
