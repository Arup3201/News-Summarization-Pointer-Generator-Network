One California lawyer counts Jamie Foxx, President Obama and Kim Kardashian among her more than 50 celebrity friends - but the bar association says that's just not true.  

Los Angeles attorney Svitlana Sangary stands accused of photoshopping herself into dozens of photos with the rich and famous, including Leonardo DiCaprio and Donald Trump.

Now the California Supreme Court is being asked to suspend Sangary's law license for six months and put her on probation for three years for using 'deceptive advertising.'

Punishment: The California bar association is recommending that Sangary's law license be suspended for six months, and that she be put on probation for three years. Pictured above with Donald Trump 

Business: According to her website, Sangary practices deals in business, real estate, foreclosure, insurance, employment and personal injury litigation 

State Bar Court Judge Donald F Miles says the photos posted on Sangary's law practice website 'were created by taking original celebrity photos and then overlaying (Sangary’s) image in order to make it appear as though (Sangary) was in the presence of that celebrity'.

In some of the photos, Sangary even uses the same picture of herself.

When confronted about the pictures two years ago, Sangary didn't even trouble herself to take the photos down from the site. They still appeared there Thursday, under a tab titled 'publicity'.

In fact, Miles says Sangary responded to the charges in a '16-page soliloquy with little to no rational connection to the charges at hand'. 

In one particularly strange excerpt, Sangary goes on a tangent about Natalie Portman's performance in the 2010 ballet-drama 'Black Swan'

The passage reads: 'Also, with regard to false statements and misleading advertisement, none other than Natalie Portman comes to mind. The online media extensively covers the controversy surrounding Natalie Portman’s performance in the film Black Swan. The ballet dancer who performed in the Black Swan, Sarah Lane, has come forward to revel [sic] a ‘cover-up’ and says that Natalie Portman’s head was superimposed on to Sarah Lane’s body, and that Natalie Portman lied.' 

She also includes an email from President Obama in the response, in which he allegedly asks her to donate to the Democratic party.

The court is recommending that Sangary's law license be suspended for six months, and she be put on probation for three years. 

That decision ultimately lies with the California Supreme Court, and Sangary has 30 days to respond.

Politicians: She wrote a 16-page response to the allegations in which she goes off on several strange tangents, including one passage about Natalie Portmans' acting in the 2010 film Black Swan. Pictured above with President Obama. 

Final say: The decision whether to suspend Sangary's law license is up to the California Supreme Court. Pictured above with Hillary CLinton
