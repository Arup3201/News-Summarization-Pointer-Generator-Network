Someone snapped up a slice of history Thursday, bidding $1,375 for a slice of Lady Diana Spencer's and Prince Charles's 1981 wedding cake.

The 33-year-old slice is '[h]oused in original white and silver presentation box dated Buckingham Palace 29 July 1981, with Prince of Wales' feathers and "CD" monogram,' according to auctioneer Nate D. Sanders' auction catalog page for the cake.

The page says bidding started at $1,100 and that there was only one bid.  

Delicious? This piece of cake from Princess Diana and Prince Charles' wedding went for $1,375 

The cake reportedly '[a]lso includes a gift card reading: "With best wishes from / Their Royal Highnesses / The Prince & Princess of Wales". Slice is whole and wrapped in original wax paper and doily,' according to the description. 

Auction house spokesman Sam Heller told the Associated Press that the buyer is a private collector.

Although the cake came wrapped in its original wax paper, Heller said it wouldn't be a good idea to try to eat it.

He added, however, that there is a small but dedicated group of royal cake collectors.

Some, Heller said, have purchased cakes dating to the days of Britain's Queen Victoria, who married in 1840.

Sold! The cake, still in its original white and silver presentation box, was sold online  August 28, 2014, by Nate D. Sanders Auctions of Los Angeles
