A man who was so desperarate to find work he auctioned himself on eBay and wrestled in gravy has finally found a job.

Dan Conway tried everything he could think of to find employment, posting his efforts on a website to grab potential employers' attention.

Now, the 28-year-old from Whitley Bay, North Tyneside, has landed his dream job as a marketing executive in America.

Dan Conway has finally found work after a desperate year-long hunt which was documented on his website, The Extreme Job Hunter

The father-of-two tried everything to find work including posting pictures and videos to social media sites

Mr Conway was contacted by Vitamins Direct and offered the post which involves working from home as well as travelling to the company's headquarters in Florida.

He said: 'This will mean a new world for me and my family. For the last year or so, we have been scrimping and saving to make ends meet.

'Hopefully, this is going to transform our lives.'

Mr Conway lost his job a week before his second child was born last year. Despite applying for hundreds of posts, the university graduate was repeatedly turned down.

As a last resort the father-of-two set up The Extreme Job Hunter website in the hope of finding work.Â 

His bizarre appeals for employment included walking around Newcastle wearing a billboard, and posting himself as for sale on eBay.

He even posted a pleading video from his three-year-old daughter Lucy begging: 'please get my daddy a job' on the website, but to no avail.

The 28-year-old sent pizza and doughnuts to companies in the hope they would give him work in return

After graduating from university with a
degree in advertising, Mr Conway had dreams of a career in advertising 
or social media, but could only find work as a part-time youth worker at
school for children with additional needs.

He was made redundant last June, a 'soul destroying' blow which led him to create the website.

Among
his pleas for work included a free iPad for anyone that could find him a
job as well as sending companies doughnuts and pizzas as 'bribes'.

At one point he even offered to work for free after extravagant efforts such as sending his CV in pinatas and recording a song for BBC director Tony Hall failed to find him a job.

Mr Conway admits that he was ready to give up about a month ago after hundreds of unanswered pleas.

His family, wife Natalie and children Lucy and Jack, was quickly running out of money and were even unable to fix their car after it broke down.

'I was having to jump on the Metro or a bus to go around finding work but I didn't have any luck', he said.

Thankfully his prayers were answered when Vitamins Direct made contact with a formal job offer.

'They said they wanted me to do what I was doing but do it for them, promoting their social media and website'.

'I'm really chuffed!' Mr Conway added.

The company's president, Glen Robinson, said: 'We wanted to hie the life of the party. Dan demonstrated that so the choice was very easy.'
