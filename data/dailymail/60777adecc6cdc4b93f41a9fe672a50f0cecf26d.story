Actor Mark Rylance yesterday quit his role in the Olympics opening ceremony after the sudden death of his ‘beloved’ stepdaughter.

Filmmaker Nataasha van Kampen, 28, collapsed from a suspected brain haemorrhage on a flight from New York.

Several doctors who were fellow passengers tried in vain to save her life on American Airlines flight AA106, which landed at Heathrow last Sunday morning.

Rylance – one of Britain’s greatest Shakespearean actors – was due to recite verses from The Tempest during Danny Boyle’s ‘Isles of Wonder’ ceremony on July 27.

But the Olivier Award-winning actor pulled out after announcing his ‘beloved daughter’ had died of ‘unsuspected natural causes’. Nataasha is the daughter of Rylance’s wife Claire van Kampen, and has known the actor since she was three. Her sister is award-winning actress Juliet Rylance.

In a statement yesterday, Rylance, 52, announced: ‘Our beloved daughter and sister Nataasha passed away of unsuspected natural causes early on Sunday morning.

‘Because of our bereavement, I have decided to withdraw from my commitment to the opening ceremony of the Olympics.’

Mark Rylance married Nataasha's mother Claire van Kampen in 1992

In an emotional tribute to his ‘Beautiful Taashi’, Nataasha’s boyfriend, London pub landlord Martin Fitzgerald, wrote: ‘Never have I met anyone who filled my life with such joy, a kind soul who brightened up my life even after we just met and a perfect lover who made me feel like the luckiest man in the world.

A brain haemorrhage is the rupture of a blood vessel which leads to bleeding in or around the brain.

It can happen after a head injury, but also – as appears to have been the case here – with no warning at all.

This type of brain haemorrhage is a form of stroke and caused by weak or abnormal blood vessels in the brain.

There are 9,000 hospital admissions for this type of haemorrhage a year – of which 80 per cent are people aged between 40 and 65. The mortality rate  is about 40 per cent.

Professor Tony Rudd, vice-chairman of the Stroke Association, said: ‘There is usually no warning in these cases, it is often a genetic abnormality the person is not aware of.’

‘I feel so privileged to have been able to spend time with you, be close to you, kiss you and share my deepest thoughts with you. I know that when I look up to the sky you will be the brightest star, shining light on my soul and bringing me the happiness and warmth I so desperately miss. ‘I love you so much and will do forever and always.’

Nataasha, a gifted independent filmmaker, started work at 16 for Sky Television, and went into production for short films before joining the London Film School. Her debut, Nocturne, was shown at the London Young Filmmakers Festival.

Dividing her time between New York and London, she described herself as an artist, designer and film-maker.

She lived in a flat near trendy Borough Market, close to London Bridge, but professed her love of New York and listed it as her ‘home town’ on Facebook. One neighbour, who said she had spoken to Mr Fitzgerald, said: ‘She had a cerebral haemorrhage on the plane. It’s just tragic – she had a heart of gold.’

Another neighbour, Karen Tate, 40, said 
Nataasha was often seen in the area, walking her Jack Russell terrier, 
Apache. She added: ‘I always used to talk to her as I walked my dog. She
was a lovely woman, and very, very pretty.’
