Former minister David Mellor issued a grovelling apology  today after he was taped calling a taxi driver a 'sweaty, stupid little s***'.

The millionaire Tory said he was 'really, really sorry' and should 'chuck the towel in' after he was caught reeling off his lifetime achievements to the driver. 

He also said he would stick to water at 'celebratory lunches' from now on. 

In his apology, he was also eager to point out that he was 'ironically, one of London taxis' best customers' and had received support from some drivers. 

Former Cabinet minister David Mellor, 65, was caught having a foul-mouthed rant at the taxi driver after he left Buckingham Palace following his partner Lady Cobham being awarded a CBE (together above)

Mr Mellor was forced into a grovelling apology on his LBC radio show today after he was taped by the driver

Last week, Mr Mellor was secretly recorded berating the cab driver after a visit to Buckingham Palace with his partner Lady Cobham, who had just been awarded a CBE.

The 65-year-old barrister and radio presenter could be heard asking the taxi driver: 'Who are you to question me?' before yelling: 'I don't want to hear from you, shut the f*** up. Smart-a**** little b******.'

He said: 'I've been in the Cabinet, I'm an award-winning broadcaster, I'm a Queen's Counsel — you think that your experiences are anything compared to mine?' 

But today Mr Mellor, who was forced to abandon his ministerial career after an affair in 1992, made an on-air apology.

Opening his show on LBC, he said: 'I can't think what possessed me to lose it with that cabbie the way I did. 

'OK, I had a case but I threw it away by the way I spoke and I'm really, really sorry about that and I especially want to apologise to you, our listeners for trying your patience and risking my own credibility with you by speaking the way I did. 

'Anyway, it's water for me at the next celebratory lunch, I've definitely made that decision.

'Ironically, I'm one of London taxis' best customers and I thank a lot of them for speaking up for me, like Steve McNamara, General Secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers Association who said and I quote "I've picked him up myself. He's actually a very nice guy.

'Despite everything he's said, he's not a bad guy. Unfortunately for him he got recorded."

'Well there's a career in broadcasting awaiting you, Steve, because I couldn't have put it in a more succinct way myself, so I thank you for that.  

'I would like to show my appreciation for the London cabbies that I have used for 40 years by making a substantial donation to their Christmas appeal for underprivileged kids.' 

Mr Mellor has said he regrets losing his temper but maintained the taxi driver provoked him. His career as a minister was ended by scandal including an affair, reported in the Mail in 1992

During the show, which discussed David Cameron's speech on immigration, guest Nigel Farage told him: 'In life we all get things wrong and you have learned that more than anyone. 

'You have just said sorry and that shows contrition and accepted you did something that was wrong.' 

In response, the 65-year-old barrister and radio presenter said: 'I couldn't defend myself, so I should chuck in the towel. I said something and then I was front page news, little me.' 

In the infamous rant, Mr Mellor, who was branded a 'snob', also told the taxi driver he had 'ruined' his 'wife's' day - although he is not married to Lady Cobham. 

The incident occurred after Mr Mellor left Buckingham Palace with his partner, Lady Penelope Cobham – chairman of VisitEngland – after she had just received a CBE for her services to tourism.

But on his show today, Mr Mellor received support from Steve McNamara, general secretary of the Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association. 

He said: 'When the story kicked off, I was amazed at how many taxi drivers were calling to offer support to you who felt you had been wronged.'

Mr Mellor replied saying: 'Thanks for your support. It's not been a good week and I can't defend what I have said. But the driver (I had) was so much different from the guys I travel with regularly.' 

Mr McNamara said: 'That's exactly it. I would prefer it if someone told me the way. It was a one-off. It was two grown men having a row.' 

The former minister then muttered under his breath: 'Yes, and it's front page news...' 

David Mellor is a well known as a Chelsea fan, pictured in the director's box with former chairman Ken Bates

Mr Mellor became a radio broadcaster after losing his seat in the House of Commons in 1997.

He resigned as heritage minister in 1992 and blamed his departure on a constant barrage of stories in the media.

He was in the 'last chance saloon' after his affair with mistress Antonia de Sancha, who sold her story to the News of the World and said Mr Mellor had sex with her while she wore a Chelsea strip.

But Prime Minister John Major continued to support him until it emerged that Mona Bauwens, the daughter of a senior member of the Palestine National Fund, had paid towards Mellor's holiday to Marbella in Spain. He then quit in September 1992.
