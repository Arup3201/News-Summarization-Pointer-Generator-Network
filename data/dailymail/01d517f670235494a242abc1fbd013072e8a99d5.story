She's famous for her love of horses and skiing but it seems Sophie Wessex isn't quite so adept when it comes to bows and arrows.

During a visit to a Buckinghamshire rehabilitation centre, she tried her hand at wheelchair archery - but managed to miss every time.

With barely any shots on target, the Countess was left chuckling ruefully as the top scoring servicemen and women being treated at the centre looked on.

Letting fly: Sophie tried her hand at wheelchair archery for the first time during a visit to Stoke Mandeville

The Countess of Wessex was completing a tour of Stoke Mandeville Stadium in Buckinghamshire when she made her ill-fated foray into archery. 

Stoke Mandeville is  the birthplace of British Paralympic sport, with the rehabilitation centre launched by neurologist Sir Ludwig Guttmann in 1943.

Guttman, who arrived in Britain as a penniless Jewish refugee fleeing Nazi Germany, was convinced that sport was key to recovery and his championing of wheelchair sports not only reaped dividends for patient care, it also led to the creation of the Paralympic Games.

The stadium, which was built on the site of Guttman's original treatment centre, was opened by the Prince of Wales in 2003 and has since been visited by all senior members of the royal family.

Sophie herself was there to launch the stadium's Hall of Fame, which recognises those who have made an 'extraordinary contribution' to British wheelchair sport.

Chocks away! Sophie lets fly with an arrow but things don't go quite as she had hoped...

Missed it! The royal claps her hand to her mouth in dismay before offering watchers a rueful smile

A long standing supporter of charities dedicated to disability, along with WheelPower, which runs Stoke Mandeville Stadium, she is also patron of Brainwave, which funds therapy for youngsters with physical difficulties, the Disability Initiative and Dyslexia Action.

Speaking about the visit, WheelPower chairman Kevin Baker said: 'We are delighted to welcome the Countess of Wessex to this special occasion at Stoke Mandeville Stadium.

'The Hall of Fame is an honour exclusively reserved for the top contributors to British wheelchair sport both past and present.

'The current names on the board have not only made remarkable achievements on a personal level, they have inspired and facilitated disabled people all over the country to take up sport.

Cheers: Sophie also travelled to RAF Wittering where she was met by children from a local primary school

'The latest additions to the Hall of Fame are all individuals that have dedicated much of their lives to wheelchair sport and their contribution has been invaluable and their names have become synomonous with Stoke Mandeville Stadium and the birthplace of the Paralympic movement.'

Sophie's visit to Stoke Mandeville has come at the end of a busy month of engagements, including one in Margate that saw her delight a wheelchair-bound boy when she gave him a hug.

She also joined in the fun at a musical playgroup in Peterborough and spent much of the visit playing with a group of excited toddlers.

More is to come, with the Countess scheduled to attend receptions on behalf of the London Press Club and Great Ormond Street Hospital tomorrow, followed by trips to Staffordshire and Birmingham.

Her husband, Prince Edward, also has plenty in his diary, starting with trips to Warwickshire and Surrey tomorrow and Friday.

Clearly still revelling in the extraordinary success of the first ever Invictus Games, Prince Harry paid tribute to the men and women who took part at the Pride of Britain Awards last night.

In a speech recorded for the show, he said 'to fight for your country takes courage but to move beyond life changing injuries takes an extraordinary level of grit and determination' before speaking of his admiration for those who managed it.

The 30-year-old continued: 'I can only begin to imagine how challenging the journey to recovery is but the admiration I have for these men and women is limitless. 

'Using the power of sport to enhance recovery, the Invictus Games showed how those who have been wounded should be recognised for their achievements post injury, rather than by being defined for their limitations post-injury. 

'The Invictus Games shone a spotlight on the unconquerable spirit of servicemen and women and their families. 

'Their stories move, inspire and humble me. They are as amazing as they are unique and I'm absolutely delighted that the team is recieving this Pride of Britain award.'
