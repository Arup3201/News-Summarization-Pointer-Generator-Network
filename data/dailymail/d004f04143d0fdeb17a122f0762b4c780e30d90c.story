Natasha Scott-Falber, 14, died earlier this year. Her parents say she was killed by toxic shock syndrome after using a tampon for the first time

A teenager who dreamed of starring in the West End died from an ultra-rare infection after using a tampon for the first time, her heartbroken family have said.

Natasha Scott-Falber, 14, died suddenly on Valentine's Day in Caerwent, Wales, five days after she fell ill with what was thought to be the norovirus.

Her family now believe the teenager died of toxic shock syndrome - a bacterial infection which affects just 40 people a year in Britain.

Posting on Facebook, her family - which includes her mother Mandy Scott, 52, brother Daniel Falber, stepfather Mike Scott and stepmother Linda Falber - have launched a campaign to raise awareness of the condition so other sufferers spot the signs earlier.

They said: 'Natasha died of toxic shock syndrome the first time that she used tampons.

'Generally speaking, it is accepted knowledge that leaving a tampon in for too long can cause toxic shock syndrome. In Natasha’s case, she followed all of the instructions and used the tampon correctly; it was simply the introduction of the tampon into her body which caused toxic shock syndrome to take effect.

'Tash became ill five days before she died but remained in good spirits, and only the evening before she died, she was telling Mandy off for fussing over her, and saying that she was feeling much better.

'She died peacefully at approximately 6.45am on Valentine’s Day after falling asleep watching one of her favourite TV programs.

Tragedy: Natasha was described as 'beautiful, gifted, funny and kind' and dreamed of starring in the West End

Paige Roffey, 15, said she collapsed from toxic shock syndrome after using a tampon for just four hours.

She was initially sent back to her home in Rayleigh, Essex, by doctors who thought she had a virus - but was rushed to Southend hospital after collapsing in the shower.

Paige was in a coma for two days and later transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital, with her mother Sarah, 39, sitting beside her bed and planning her funeral.

The teenager highlighted the case in 2011 after she returned to school, determined to let others know what had happened and what to look out for.

She said: 'I still feel ill some days but I am getting my strength back. I just want it to be a lot more known than it is.'

'We cannot express how much we miss our 
beautiful, gifted, kind and funny Natasha. All of our family, and many 
others close to us, are still reeling from the shock of losing our 
wonderful girl.

'We hope that you and your family never have to go 
through what we have gone through, and are still going through.'

Natasha,
 who was found dead by her father Mike Falber, was described as an 
'all-singing and all-dancing' youngster who enjoyed acting and playing 
the guitar.

She had been selected last year to perform in a backing choir for English tenor Alfie Boe at one of Wales' most prestigious concert halls, St David's Hall, Cardiff.

After Natasha's death it was initially believed she had fallen victim to septicaemia, better known as blood poisoning.

Toxic shock syndrome affects about 40 people each year in the UK.

The infection is caused when usually harmless 
Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus bacteria, which live on the skin, invade the bloodstream and produce dangerous toxins.

A statement from BUPA said: 'It's not exactly understood why using a tampon is linked with toxic shock syndrome, but tampon absorbency (the amount of menstrual blood a tampon absorbs) is thought to be a factor.

'If you're a woman using tampons, use a
 tampon with the lowest absorbency suitable for your menstrual blood 
flow, change your tampon frequently, use a sanitary towel or panty liner
 from time to time during your period, never insert more than one tampon
 at one time and use a sanitary towel at night instead of a tampon.'

The family of Natasha Scott-Falber, left, say she died from toxic shock syndrome after using her first tampon. Essex schoolgirl Paige Roffey, right, said in 2011 that the same condition put her in a coma for two days

The family said: 'We thought that one 
thing we could do, to honour Natasha, and to help others, would be to 
start an awareness campaign about toxic shock syndrome.

'We
 are in communication with Public Health Wales, the two main tampon 
companies, and we have already had some success with GPs and with the 
education system in Gwent. All the age-appropriate pupils attending 
schools in Gwent have been made aware of toxic shock syndrome.

'We are determined to make at least everyone in the UK aware of what the symptoms are, and what the risks are.'

Streptococcus bacteria live on the skin

Toxic shock syndrome is a highly dangerous bacterial infection - but it can be misdiagnosed, because the symptoms are the same as other illnesses and because it is so rare.

It occurs when usually harmless Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus bacteria, which live on the skin, invade the bloodstream and produce dangerous toxins.

This causes a sudden high fever, a massive drop in blood pressure resulting in dizziness and confusion, and occasionally vomiting and diarrhoea.

Other symptoms - none of which are exclusive to toxic shock syndrome, which is extremely rare - include a sunburn-like skin rash, the whites of the eyes becoming red or pink and the shedding of the skin in large sheets, especially from the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, one or two weeks after becoming ill.

Women
 are most at risk of getting toxic shock syndrome during menstruation 
and particularly if they are using tampons, have recently given birth, 
or are using an internal barrier contraceptive such as a diaphragm.
