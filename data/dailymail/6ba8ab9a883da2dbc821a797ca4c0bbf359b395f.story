Thirty-five years after the U.S. Olympic hockey team's stunning gold medal at the Lake Placid Winter Olympics, the once-fuzzy-faced heroes are being feted for their signature accomplishment.

Every surviving member of the hockey team reunited for a 'Relive the Miracle' reunion on Saturday in preparation for a celebratory night tonight at Herb Brooks Arena, the hockey rink on Main Street they made famous with one of the most memorable upsets in sports history.

Missing is Brooks, the Hall of Fame coach who was killed in a car accident in 2003, and rugged defenseman Bob Suter, who died at age 57 in September.

Miracle team: The underdog American team upset the Soviet Union and Finland to win the gold medal in 1980

Sunday marks the 35th anniversary of when the U.S. took the lead on Friday, Febraury 22, 1980, against the powerful Soviet Union team on Mike Eruzione's goal midway through the third period. 

Eruzione, who works in alumni relations at Boston University, says the goal and the team's improbable gold medal have changed his life. 

He says he deals 'with it so often it's hard to believe it's been 35 years' because every week he's doing something or going somewhere that's associated with 1980. 

The Americans finished the 4-3 upset to the sound of broadcaster Al Michaels' call of, 'Do you believe in miracles?' Two days later, the U.S. beat Finland for the gold.

Lake Placid News reports that 15 of the 19 surviving members of the 1980 U.S. hockey team who will be at tonight's program gave a brief press conference this afternoon in the Lake Placid Conference Center. 

The team paid tribute to Bob Suter, the first member of that team to pass away. Suter, a Wisconsin defenseman, died of a heart attack at age 57 in September, reports NBC.

In celebration: Every surviving member of the hockey team is back for a reunion on Saturday at Herb Brooks Arena, the hockey rink on Main Street they made famous with one of the most memorable wins 

'He did a lot for hockey,' Eruzione said today. 

'We all realize at some point we’re going to move on. But nobody thought Bobby, at 57, would not be with us,' he added.

Eruzione then asked the people in the room if any were visiting Lake Placid for the first time since 1980.

When no one said a word that's when Eruzione stepped back in.

'Ask the bartenders,' he said causing the room to fill with laughter.

'We are the most immature people that you will ever, ever meet,' Eruzione said .

'You think we’re grown men? Not happening,' he added.

'Can you imagine that atmosphere in the locker room when we were playing?,' the jokes?

Several of the players visited the locker room on Saturday morning but many of them couldn't remember where they sat 35 years ago.

The locker room shown in the 2004 film 'Miracle,' with coach Herb Brooks‘ famous speech was much bigger and nicer in comparison to the small locker room.

The players were asked what they were thinking before Brooks gave that speech, as they waited to crush the Soviets in an amazing game.

'It definitely wasn’t let’s go out and try not to embarrass ourselves,' said Eruzione.

Eruzione scored the winning point in the third period, after Soviet goalie Vladislav Tretiak was infamously pulled by coach Viktor Tikhonov.

'The real story shouldn’t be Tretiak,' Eruzione said. 

'The real story is why they scored three goals and not six or seven,' he continued. 

Before the press conference even began on Saturday,  team members gathered on a stage at what would normally be center ice at Herb Brooks Arena where an event will also take place tonight.

The arena is formally the Olympic Fieldhouse where the 1980 Olympic games were played.

'We continue to be amazed that it has carried on and lived on in a lot of respects,' forward Dave Christian said. 

'It gave people a sense of feeling good. When you think about it, you can’t help but smile.'

Eruzione also piped up again talking about how the event warmed the hearts of the nation.

'When the Patriots won the Super Bowl, people in New England are happy,' Eruzione said. 

'People in Seattle are not. People in California couldn’t care less. When it’s Olympic Games, it’s a nation.'

Player Neal Broten, who scored 923 NHL points, the most among Miracle players, recalled the pre-Olympic game against the Soviets in Madison Square Garden in which the U.S. lost 10-3.

'We were setting them up,'Broten said.

'If you go on a scale from one to 10, we were two and they were 10,' he said while comparing the two teams.

Mike Ramsey, a 19-year-old defenseman on the Miracle on Ice team, recalled soviet player Slava Fetisov discussing the Miracle on Ice when they were teammates on the Detroit Red Wings.

'You were on drugs,' Ramsey said Fetisov joked.

The press conference ended with the players sharing their favorite quotations from their coach Herb Brooks.

Festivities this evening which begin at 7:30 will include audio, video and still pictures, as well as a discussion of the game with the players. 

Suter's jersey also will be raised to the rafters as a tribute.

NBC also plans to anchor its 'Hockey Day in America' coverage from Lake Placid on Sunday and feature the team.

Several team members also are hosting a five-day fantasy camp beginning March 29 that so far has attracted more than 50 participants.
