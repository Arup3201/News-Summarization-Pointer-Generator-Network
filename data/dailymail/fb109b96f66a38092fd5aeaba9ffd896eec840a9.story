Bernard Ingham has branded anti-fracking protestors 'blinkered totalitarians' in a scathing diatribe

Sir Bernard Ingham has denounced anti-fracking demonstrators as 'blinkered totalitarians'.

Sir Bernard, who was Margaret Thatcher's press secretary, said: 'It seems they want us all to live in their yurts, tepees and wigwams in a sort of glorious save-the-planet pre-industrial squalor, regardless of our manifest objections.

'If that is not totalitarianism, I don't know what is.'

Sir Bernard said: 'The problem with anti-fracking fanatics is that like other zealots they are blinkered totalitarians,' adding the activists are 'guilty of hypocrisy, utter stupidity and exaggeration'.

'Their entire approach to energy is to plump for everything that does not work and exclude anything that does - coal, gas, oil and especially nuclear energy which emits next to no CO2.

'Worse still, their long campaign has captured our limited politicians.'

In his article in the Yorkshire Post, he added: 'The result is that short of an early shale gas bonanza we can no longer rely on any government of whatever political complexion to provide secure supplies of energy at affordable cost.'

There were fewer than 100 protesters left last night at a potential fracking site as they finally admitted defeat to the police.

More than 1,200 activists had brought exploratory shale gas drilling to a halt on the edge of the village of Balcombe, West Sussex, at the weekend.

But after officers from more than 10 police forces pushed back campaigners from the site’s entrance allowing lorries to enter on Monday, they left in their droves.

A ‘Reclaim the Power’ camp that had been illegally set up in a farmer’s field two miles away was completely dismantled yesterday afternoon.

Despite tents being camped out on the grass verges, traffic was not stopped and the country road was kept open by the police.

Some people who had set up camping areas on footpaths around the drill were evicted by police officers without a fuss. Their only resistance was walking slowly in front of a lorry while chanting.

One of the few remaining protesters is Natalie Hynde, daughter of Pretenders singer Chrissie and the Kinks frontman Ray Davies, who has returned after being arrested at the site for a public disorder offence last week.

It comes as energy company Cuadrilla is expected to start its exploratory drilling again soon.

Engineers were yesterday again carrying out maintenance work in preparation.

Despite being guarded by 25 police officers, the company has hired a team of security guards with dogs to patrol the barbed wire perimeter fence.

Dave Packham, 37, who is unemployed and from London, was trying to hitch-hike back to the capital. He said: ‘I think it’s all over now. I came down last week but numbers have really dropped.

‘It was fun while it lasted and there was a great atmosphere. This has been like a music festival and people have really pulled together. I think the police are now not going to let us carry on so it’s time to move on.’

Hundreds of environmental campaigners had been buoyed by Sussex Police’s advice to energy company Cuadrilla that it could not secure the area from incursions last week.

As a result, the company decided last 
week to temporarily ‘scale down’ work to see how much potential energy 
was buried deep under the ground.

This led to accusations the police had given into mob rule and were not enforcing the rule of law.

Cuadrilla hopes to carry out exploratory drilling to assess if it is worth applying for a licence to extract shale gas that might involve fracking. The overall police operation against the protesters is expected to cost taxpayers more than £2million as it goes into its third week.

Prime Minister David Cameron has said the whole country should accept fracking as it might potentially cut rising energy bills.
