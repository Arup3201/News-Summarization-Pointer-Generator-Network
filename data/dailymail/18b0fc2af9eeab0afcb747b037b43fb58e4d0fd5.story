A 21-year-old college student who says she is pregnant with the love child of married NFL star Arian Foster is due any day now.

Brittany Norwood is suing Foster, 27, to determine paternity of the child and claiming emotional distress - but the Houston Texans star is reportedly already paying child support to the single mother.

Norwood went public in January with claims that she got pregnant during an affair last year with Foster and that he and his brother tried to pressure her to have an abortion. He denies those allegations.

Foster has been married to German-born model and singer Romina Reinhart since 2011. They have two children together.

The three-time Pro Bowl running back signed a five-year, $43.5million contract in 2012. He made $5.25million last season.

Any day: Brittany Norwood, 21, twitted this picture of her in full bloom - revealing that she is due in the coming days

Norwood also posted a sonogram picture of her baby. She plans to name him Gatsby Alexander

Norwood, who was a senior at the University of Houston before she got pregnant, shared a picture of her blossoming baby bump on her Twitter account last week. She revealed she would be due in two to four weeks.

She has also written about the challenges of enduring her pregnancy as a single mother-to-be.

'Trying so hard not to have a break down putting together this baby bassinet. Doing everything on your own is tough,' she writes.

She revealed that she plans to name the child Gatsby Alexander.

However, she also takes thinly-veiled swipes at Foster, who ended his relationship with her.

'Men these days are real quick to lie and say what they can to get what 
they want but they say peace real quick when a baby is involved,' she tweeted.

Adding: 'Live and learn, I can only hope and pray my son turns out to be the man his mom is.'

However, a source told KPRC-TV that Foster is already giving financial support to Norwood.

Earlier this month, she tweeted about Chanel designer handbags with the hastag 'noknockoffs.'

In another post she wrote: 'Taking my Herve out of the closet so I can admire it. I can't wait to have my body back with my baby boy accessory,' referring to the famous 'bandage' dress by designer Herve Leger.

She also wrote: 'Baby chino and linen. I love dressing my little baby doll already!'

In April, she tweeted: 'I can't wait to order a Shirley Temple in a few short hours and be like "No please check my I.D." #finafreakinly21.'

Foster himself hasn't commented.

Both Foster and Norwood are due in court for paternity test proceedings once the baby is born.
