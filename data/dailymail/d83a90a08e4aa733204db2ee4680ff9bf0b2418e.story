Suzuki has been forced to recall more than 19,000 mid-size cars in the U.S. after discovering spiders attracted to its gasoline vapours are weaving webs and blocking up the exhausts.

The automaker issued the recall of their 2010 to 2013 Kizashi models after fears the webs could cause the gas tank to deform leading to a possible fire.

It is thought that the spiders, although it is unknown which type, are drawn in by the gasoline vapours and once inside the exhaust begin to weave webs.

The Sukuzi Kizashi, which has been recalled after spiders have been founded to weave webs in the exhaust which could cause a fire

This cuts off the air flow causing negative pressure in the gas tank which can lead to fuel leaks and even fire.

The recall was prompted by seven reports of the problem, although according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, there have been no accidents or injuries in the U.S. due to the fault.

Owners with affected cars will be notified this month and service centres will replace the vent line with one that is fitted with a filter to keep the spiders out and replace the gas tank if necessary.

It is the second time a car manufacturer has been forced to recall vehicles due to problems with spiders.

In April, Mazda recalled 42,000 Mazda 6 midsize cars in America with 2.5 litre engines due to a similar problem.

It affected cars made from 2010 to 2012 after it was found yellow sac spiders, which are attracted to hydrocarbons, builds webs that cause pressure to build in the fuel tank.

The Kizashi was one of Suzuki's best selling models in the United States before they pulled out of the market last year after three years.

It came after the American Sukuzi Motor Corp filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in November 2012.

Last month they also recalled nearly 26,000 midsize cars, including the 2004 to 2006 Verona, Forenza and Reno models in the U.S. because the daytime running light modules were at risk of overheating and causing a fire.
