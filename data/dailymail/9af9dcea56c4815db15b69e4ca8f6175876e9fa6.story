A couple were left shocked when workmen accidentally threw away their bespoke 'kitchen for life' worth almost £10,000 - and binmen mistook it for rubbish.

Julie Martin, 51, and partner Kevin McKeith, 53, were having some new electrical wire installed in their house in South Shields, Newcastle, when they realised their kitchen fittings had been taken away to the tip, leaving their expensive kitchen a gutted husk.

The contractors had taken down all of the kitchen units, cupboards and surfaces in order to fit the wiring in the walls, and placed them at the back of the house - only for binmen to take them away.

The mistake cost the couple £9,500, and now they are left searching for a new kitchen.

Ms Martin and Mr McKeith were in the midst of having their kitchen repaired by contractors who were working on behalf of South Tyneside Homes, who were carrying out the work as a part of their 'Decent Homes' programme.

Because the couple loved their bespoke kitchen, they declined the offer of a new one, but still needed some rewiring and a new bathroom.

Ms Martin, said: 'We got our own kitchen put in about five years ago and we spent £9,500 on it.

'I
 love cooking and baking so I spend a lot of time in, and we wanted 
something that was going to last - that was meant to be our kitchen for 
life.

'They have accepted blame, but what I don't understand is if they put the cupboards outside, they
 must have known they had to bring them back in when they were done, and
 if the cupboards were missing then why didn't they say anything?

The workmen had left the fittings outside next to the bins while they had carried out the electrical wire renovations, where the binmen mistook the expensive cabinets for rubbish

Julie Martin was having renovations to her South Shields house as a part of the Decent Homes programme - but had declined a kitchen renovation because she was happy with her £9,500 kitchen

'We told the council that we didn't want a new kitchen off them and were happy to keep the one we had.

'The workers needed to take the top cupboards off the walls to do the re-wiring.

'The story is that to make more room for themselves, they put the cupboards out in the back yard then a binman, who was going around collecting rubbish, came and took them away.

'It wasn't until the next day that I started sorting through boxes and things in the kitchen and noticed they weren't anywhere in the house.'

Julie, a support worker for people with brain injuries, said she contacted housing bosses, who held their hands up and admitted fault straight away.

Ms Martin has been offered a new kitchen by the housing authority, which has admitted they were in error, but she feels she hasn't been offered one of the same standard

The couple have been told they can choose a replacement kitchen as means of compensation, but they say they have yet to be offered one they feel is of the same quality or value to the units they lost.

A spokesman for South Tyneside Homes said: 'This was a genuine mistake on behalf of the contractor, which has accepted responsibility and apologised for the error.

'The contractor has assured us they are working very hard to resolve the issue and have offered the tenant a range of options to try to progress this as quickly as possible.

'We are waiting to hear back from Mr McKeith to take this forward.'
