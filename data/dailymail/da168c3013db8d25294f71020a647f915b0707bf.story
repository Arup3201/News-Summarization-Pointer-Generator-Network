Segolene Royal, who has denied she has banned female colleagues from wearing low cut tops

The former partner of French president Francois Hollande has been forced to deny she has banned female colleagues from wearing low cut tops.

Eyebrows were raised earlier this month when Segolene Royal, mother of President Francois Hollande's four children, was made a senior minister in Mr Hollande’s Socialist government.

The new ecology minister is said to be living up to her surname by acting like an unelected queen, according to fellow Socialists.

Le Point, the highly respected news magazine, claimed that she ‘banned necklines’ and imposed a ‘ruthless set of rules’.

They claimed regulations insist that staff stand to attention when she walks by, bans them from ‘making too much noise’ when she is having lunch and has stopped staff from smoking.

They also alleged Ms Royal insists that all offices apart from her own have to be shared by at least two people.

However, as anger grew against Ms Royal, she took to Twitter to deny the new 'rules'.

'Of course I deny the ridiculous rumour concerning the banning of low cut tops in the ministry,' she said.

Ms Royal also added: 'The only rules laid
 down here were in regards to a greater rigor in the use of public 
funds, that the French people expect from us.'

Ms Royal also added, 'The only rules laid down here were in regards to a greater rigor in the use of public funds, that the French people expect from us'

However, opponents said Ms Royal, 60, was simply backtracking from a massive mistake, and that her Socialist government was notorious for its wasteful public spending.

Ms Royal, had a long relationship with Mr Hollande but was famously humiliated when he left her for the Paris Match journalist Valerie Trierweiler.

Ms Trierweiler was herself dumped by Mr Hollande in January after his latest affair with actress Julie Gayet, 41, was made public. 

The 49-year political journalist was 
hospitalised after the affair was revealed and was then forced to move 
out of the Elysee Palace.

However, in a new book released yesterday, it was claimed Mr Hollande is 'missing' Ms Trierweiler and is becoming attached to the former journalist once again.

The book, 'The President who Wanted to Live his Lives' claims a full break of the relationship never occurred and that the president remains 'tender and considerate' towards his ex-partner.

Extracts from the book by journalist Elise Karlin, published in L'Express magazine yesterday allege Mr Hollande bought Ms Trierweiler flowers when they met for a meal at one of their favourite restaurants in Paris last month.

The book also claims he 'hates solitude' and has given the impression his feelings for her are 'far from extinguished'.

Friends have also been quoted as saying he is almost 'harassing' her with tender text messages.

However, the book also alleges, without citing any sources, that Ms Trierweiler expects a public act of contrition on his part before any reconciliation.

But it also hints the president may have an ulterior motive, and is trying to stop Ms Trierweiler from writing her own tell-all book.
