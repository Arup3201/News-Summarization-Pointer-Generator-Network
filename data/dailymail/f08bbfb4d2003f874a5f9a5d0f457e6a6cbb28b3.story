The Manchester City squad wrapped up warm for a Thursday afternoon recovery session following their 4-1 win against Sunderland on Wednesday night.

Frank Lampard and Co ensured they were layered up before heading outside at City's Carrington training ground and gathering around boss Manuel Pellegrini.

The players involved in City's Stadium of Light victory swapped boots for trainers as the likes of Sergio Aguero and Joe Hart looked to warm down ahead of the game against Everton on Saturday.

Pellegrini received a double boost after watching his side come from behind to slay Sunderland on Wednesday night after revealing injured captain Vincent Kompany is close to a return. 

Kompany missed the Sunderland clash with a hamstring strain and is also out of the weekend's game against Everton, but Pellegrini now hopes he could be back for next week's crucial Champions League clash with Roma.

'Vincent is improving and maybe it is not such a serious injury as we thought at the beginning - but he needs to see the whole week and we will see what happens with him,' the Chilean said.
