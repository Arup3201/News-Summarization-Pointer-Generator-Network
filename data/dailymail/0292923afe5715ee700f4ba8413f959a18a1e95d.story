A cousin of former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez pleaded not guilty today to a contempt charge for allegedly refusing to testify before the grand jury that indicted Hernandez in the murder of a friend.

Tanya Singleton entered her plea on a criminal contempt charge during a brief court appearance in Fall River, Massachusetts.

Her attorney, E. Peter Parker, did not seek bail for her, agreeing that she be held until a hearing on October 3.

Singleton was offered immunity but refused to testify before the grand jury, District Attorney Samuel Sutter said.

She has been held since August 1 in a Suffolk County jail and was indicted Thursday.

The grand jury on Thursday indicted Hernandez on first-degree murder and weapons charges in the death of 27-year-old Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional football player from Boston who was dating the sister of Hernandez's girlfriend.

Lloyd's body was found June 17 in an industrial park in North Attleborough, about a mile from Hernandez's home. He had been shot five times.

Hernandez, 23, pleaded not guilty to murder and weapons charges in district court in June, and he is being held without bail.

One of his attorneys, Michael Fee, said yesterday that there had been an 'incredible rush to judgment' in the case and that he doesn't believe the state will be able to prove the charges during a jury trial.

Prosecutors say Hernandez orchestrated the killing because he was upset at Lloyd for talking to people Hernandez had problems with at a nightclub days earlier.

They say two Hernandez associates, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, were with the ex-player at the time Lloyd was killed.

In Fall River today, the judge held a closed hearing before Singleton's arraignment.

Gregg Miliote, a spokesman for Sutter, declined to comment on the substance of the proceeding.

He also would not comment on what information prosecutors had hoped to learn from Singleton in grand jury testimony.

Parker had no comment outside the courthouse on the indictment. Asked how she's doing, he said: 'She's doing good.'

In July, authorities seized a cellphone and credit and bank cards from Singleton, who is from Hernandez's hometown of Bristol, Connecticut.

Court records show Ortiz told investigators he and Wallace drove to Bristol after Lloyd's killing and that he was dropped off at Singleton's house. Ortiz said he discussed Lloyd's killing with her.

Authorities say Singleton later purchased a bus ticket for Wallace to travel to Miramar, Florida, where his parents live.

Wallace was indicted yesterday on a charge of being an accessory to murder after the fact.

He pleaded not guilty earlier in district court to the same charge. He was ordered held on $500,000 bail.

Ortiz has not been indicted. He pleaded not guilty in district court to a weapons charge and is being held without bail. He has a court hearing Thursday.

Hernandez, who was dropped by the Patriots within hours of his arrest on June 26, could face life in prison without parole if convicted.

But when he appeared briefly in Attleboro District Court yesterday for a previously scheduled probable-cause hearing he looked relaxed.

Authorities have said they haven't found the murder weapon, which they believe was a .45-caliber Glock pistol, but warrants released earlier this month suggested Hernandez may have asked his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, to dispose of it.

Investigators did recover a magazine for .45-caliber bullets in Hernandez's Hummer as well as ammunition of the same caliber inside a condo he rented in Franklin, Massachusetts.

Authorities also recovered a shell casing that matched those found at the homicide scene after tracking the rental car Hernandez was in the night Lloyd died.

Since then, Boston police have asked police in Hernandez's hometown of Bristol, Connecticut for their help with the probe into Lloyd's homicide as well as a 2012 double homicide near a Boston nightclub.

A Connecticut police lieutenant said authorities searched the home of Hernandez's uncle, seizing an SUV sought in the double killing that had been rented in Hernandez's name.

Two men died in the July 2012 shooting in Boston's South End, with witnesses reporting that gunfire came from inside a gray SUV with Rhode Island tags.

Boston police haven't reported any arrests in the deaths of Daniel Jorge Correia de Abreu, 29, and Safiro Teixeira Furtado, 28, and won't comment on whether Hernandez is a suspect.

Hernandez is also facing civil litigation after a Connecticut man filed a lawsuit asserting the former player shot him in the face in February after they argued at a Miami strip club.

Alexander Bradley, who says he lost an eye, told police at the time he didn't know who shot him.
