A master mixologist has combined two of summer's best food and drink offerings - cocktails and ice lollies - to create an inventive new tipple.

The Poptail, a mash-up between a Prosecco cocktail and a popsicle, is the brainchild of David Kay of Late Night London, which is well known for its quirky spin on classic drinks.

Other creations include the Creme Egg mojito, a mix of rum, chocolate liqueur, mint and Creme Eggs, the Dangerously Divine, a caramel salted chocolate martini, and Morning Glory - a cocktail topped up with Fruit Loop cereal.

Cocktail of the summer: A mixologist has created the Poptail - a Prosecco cocktail sweetened with an ice lolly

David explains that the inspiration behind his £7 poptail was the idea of drinking ‘like a grown-up’.

The drink, which is served at central London bars The Gable, The Sterling, The Last and Grace Bar, is available in raspberry and passionfruit flavour.

The 
popsicles, which are made from all natural ingredients and have a low 
sugar content, were created by gourmet lollipop makers, Lickalix, to David’s exact specifications for complementing the dryness of the Prosecco.

Speaking about the 285-calorie cocktail, David, who is head mixologist at Late Night London,
 said: ‘We have designed the ultimate summer experience with the 
Poptail, a perfect combination of alcoholic delight and cool refreshing 
flavours certain to have you hooked.

'I wanted 
to complement the nuances of the Prosecco with bespoke lollies that 
would collectively produce a unique taste sensation.

'They are extremely 
light and fruity and go down phenomenally easily in the summer sun.'
