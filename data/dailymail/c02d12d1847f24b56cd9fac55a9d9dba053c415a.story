'Big heart': Darren Bull, 34, who died trying to save his girlfriend's life

A young woman rescued from a cliff face after an abseiling accident did not know her boyfriend had fallen to his death as he was trying to help her.

Katherine Donohue, who is in her 20s, and her boyfriend Darren Bull, 34, had been abseiling in the Blue Mountains in Australia, in an area west of Sydney, on Saturday.

They were halfway down a 200-metre descent in the popular climbing area known as Malaita Point when the accident occurred.

Police said Miss Donohue ran into difficulties when her rope became tangled.

She started calling for help and Mr Bull went to her aid.

But
 as he started out on his rescue mission, he plunged to his death - an 
incident that was not witnessed by his stranded girlfriend.

Mr
 Bull's family did not wish to talk about his death, but friends from 
the Macquarie University Football Club remembered him today as a man 
with a 'big heart and a big personality'.

Teammate Simon Lawrenson told the Sydney Morning Herald: 'He was quiet... but once you really got him to open up, he was hilarious.'

Inspector Ken Shack-Evans of Katoomba Police said: 'They commenced abseiling in this area and shortly after have struck difficulties with the female becoming stranded on the rope halfway down the abseil.

Beauty: Australia's Blue Mountains are popular with climbers and usually seen as a safe place to abseil

'Unfortunately, the male person, a bit further down the abseil, fell off the cliff edge.'

The Blue Mountains National Park covers more than 10,000 sq km and stretches 220km from north to south.

It lies just 60km from the centre of Sydney.

The area ranges in elevation from sea level to 1,334 metres on the Boyd Plateau

Accidents are relatively unusual, but do occur. In September this year, British man Gary Tweddle was found after he vanished in Sydney having apparently taken drugs.

The trapped woman continued to call help and her cries were heard by a tourist, who raised the alarm.

Specialist police climbers were able to reach the woman, who was winched up the cliff to safety.

Police said she was still unaware that her boyfriend had died when she was rescued.

His body was located at the base of the steep cliff, but police and other climbing experts said recovering it would be a dangerous mission.

Steve McNamara, a freelance cameraman who arrived at the scene, told the Sydney Morning Herald that the recovery operation involved moving the body into a position so that a helicopter could lift it out.

A spokeswoman from the Ambulance Service of New South Wales said emergency personnel had constructed a rope system allowing experts to reach the stranded woman and lift her to the top of the cliff.

It was not known whether the couple were experienced abseilers.
