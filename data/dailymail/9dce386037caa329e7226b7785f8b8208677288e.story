A prestigious French institute has admitted losing more than 2,300 samples of the potentially deadly SARS virus.

Researchers revealed yesterday that 26 boxes, containing 2,349 vials of the disease, had gone missing from Institut Pasteur in Paris.

Alarmingly, they only discovered the samples had vanished after carrying out a routine inventory.

But they have been quick to reassure the public the vials do not pose a health risk - saying the contain only fragments of the virus, and therefore cannot pass on the infection. 

'The tubes concerned have no 
infectious potential,' a statement from the institute said.

'Independent experts 
referred by health authorities have qualified the risk as “nil” in 
regards to available evidence and literature on the survival of the SAS 
virus.'

Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly contagious, serious and potentially deadly respiratory illness.

Caused by the SARS coronavirus, it kills around 10 per cent of those who become infected.

It has flu-like symptoms that usually begin two to ten days after infection, including high temperature, fatigue, headaches, muscle pain and loss of appetite.

It later affects the respiratory system, causing additional symptoms such as a dry cough and breathing difficulties.

As an airborne virus, SARS is spread in a similar manner to the flu and common colds.

It was responsible for the deaths of almost 800 people during the 2003 outbreak in Asia.

The institute, which was the first research body to isolate HIV in the 1980s, discovered the samples were missing during a routine inventory, according to The Local.

It immediately contacted France's drug and health safety agency, ANSM, which carried out an 'in-depth' investigation into the disappearance.

But despite spending four weeks searching for the missing vials, it has been unable to locate them, according to the statement.

Now, the institute has formally asked French authorities to investigate the disappearance.

Researchers believe the samples may have been destroyed - either by accident, or without any record having been made.

'The theory of human error is the most 
probable, but we are not ruling anything out,' said  Christian Bréchot, director general of the institute.

Institut Pasteur, founded in June 1887, was named after Louis Pasteur, who made a number of remarkable breakthroughs in modern medicine.

The French chemist and microbiologist discovered the principles of pasteurization and microbial fermentation - and created the first ever vaccines for rabies and anthrax.

More than 8,000 people were infected with the disease during the 2003 outbreak in Asia.

Almost 800 of these died, while thousands more became seriously ill.
