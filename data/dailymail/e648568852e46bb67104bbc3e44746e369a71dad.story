Lazar Markovic hit Behrang Safari in the face and deserved to be sent off by top referee Bjorn Kuipers.

Striking or attempting to strike an opponent is viewed as violent conduct. Of course, Safari ‘made a meal of it’ but that is the modern game.

Kuipers had a clear view of Markovic looking for his man before throwing his arm out at him in a violent way and was right to send him off.

Kuipers is rated very highly by UEFA. You could see why. His other key decision, turning down Gerrard’s penalty appeal, was also spot on as the Basle goalkeeper got the ball at Gerrard’s feet.

Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel's take on the decision in his match report, reads: '[Markovic was] a victim of that fatal combination – his own stupidity and the spiteful cunning of an opponent.

'Markovic, who had looked lively out wide with Raheem Sterling moved to Lambert’s role, was speeding away from Behrang Safari when, for reasons best known to himself, he decided to flick out an arm to keep him back.

'If he touched the Basle man it was little more than a fingertip but he fell as if struck by sniper fire. Kuipers bought it, and Markovic was shown a straight red card. He had local sympathy but, let’s face it, if Mario Balotelli had done that he would have been castigated for impetuous foolishness.'

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers and Basle boss Paulo Sousa, unsurprisingly, offered contrasting views on the decision to send Markovic off.

'I thought the sending off was really disappointing decision by the referee,' said Rodgers.

'Lazar Markovic gets sent off for that, his fingernail barely touches the nose of the defender and the defender is the guy who should be looked at for his reaction.'

Sousa said: 'It is not for me to contest these decisions. I will not contest what Rodgers says.

'From what I hear from my players he (Safari) is not that sort of player.'
