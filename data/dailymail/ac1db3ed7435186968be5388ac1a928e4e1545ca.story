A promising young boxer who wanted to change the sport's blood image has died in hospital - less than two days after losing a 10-round featherweight bout.

Braydon Smith, 23, collapsed 90 minutes after his WBC Asian Boxing Council continental title bout with Filipino John Moralde on Saturday night. 

The Toowoomba boxer had been placed in an induced coma at Brisbane's Princess Alexandra Hospital before he died on Monday afternoon surrounded by family.

Smith appeared to be fine after leaving the ring on Saturday and had given an upbeat interview following his loss  before returning to his dressing room.

His girlfriend, Kirstie Nicholls, held an icepack against Smith's swollen face as he joked about the tough fight, the Courier Mail reports.

Soon after, he started complaining of a headache and 90 minutes later he collapsed. 

He was rushed to hospital with suspected minor bleeding and swelling on the brain. Smith was placed in an induced coma, but never regained conciousness after surgery, the Toowoomba Chronicle reports.  

'I was a massive fan of Braydon, his No.1 fan,' Ms Nicholls said on Monday night. 'I love him ... we were soulmates.'

The young boxer - nicknamed 'The Great White' - was highly regarded for being a humble and dedicated competitor, determined to revamp the image of his beloved sport.

'He really wanted to change the image of boxing,' family spokesman James O'Shea said.

'A lot of times in this country the sport gets a bad rap.

'A big goal of his life was to show people it's not (a bad sport).'

John Hogg, the Australian National Boxing Federation's Queensland medical registrar, said he was baffled as Smith had been checked before and after the bout by two different doctors.

Smith only had two stitches inserted following the fight.  

'The doctor obviously had no cause for concern so it's a mystery as to what's happened,' he said.

Mr O'Shea said the massive outpouring of support from the local and wider community was testament to Smith's upstanding reputation. 

'So many people looked up to him,' he said.

On social media, people using the hashtag 'prayforbrayd' have sent their messages of support to the young man, repeatedly praised for being a 'true gentleman' of the boxing fraternity.

He had been surrounded by family, including father and trainer Brendon, and friends since being hospitalised.

As well as boxing, Smith was completing his final year of law at the University of Southern Queensland.

Family representative James O'Shea said the massive outpouring of support from the local and wider community was testament to Smith's upstanding reputation
