The Government has been hit by a new data security scandal after a secret file on the fatal shooting of Mark Duggan by police went missing.

A computer disk containing details of the case which triggered Britain's worst riots in a generation is thought to have been lost in the post by the Ministry of Justice.

Scotland Yard confirmed it was looking into the case – and had taken action over the potential security implications.

Violence: The death of Mark Duggan in 2011 sparked a wave of riots, arson and looting across the UK

According to some sources, the file may contain the name of the policeman who killed Duggan, as well as the identities of other officers involved. 

None of the officers has been identified since Duggan died four years ago and the Met would not confirm or deny if their names were on the disk.

Jurors at the inquest into Duggan's death – who cleared police of killing him unlawfully – were also granted anonymity, and it is possible their details were also on the disk.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has ordered an investigation to try to find out how the disk vanished – and to find it. Britain's data watchdog, the Information Commissioner, is also examining the case.

On August 4, 2011, Duggan was in a minicab travelling through North London when the vehicle was stopped by police.

The 29-year-old was in the feared Tottenham Man Dem gang and although he only had relatively minor convictions for cannabis possession and handling stolen goods, police feared he was out to avenge the death of a cousin, and so put him under surveillance.

Duggan is said to have brandished a firearm at officers before running off and was shot twice, dying from a gunshot wound to the chest. 

A pistol was found wrapped in a sock up to 20ft from his body, over a fence.

Two days later, relatives of Duggan, accompanied by local residents, marched on Tottenham's police station, demanding answers about the killing. 

After a confrontation with riot officers, cars and buses were torched. 

Looting then began as police stood back and over the next two days the disorder spread across the country, leading to five deaths and £200million of damage. 

More than 1,400 rioters were later jailed.

Investigations into the case were also dogged by controversy.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission admitted it had given false information to journalists in the wake of the killing, while Scotland Yard apologised for not telling Duggan's family about his death straight away.

Police involved in the shooting refused to be questioned by the IPCC, giving written statements instead, while an inquest was delayed.

When it finally began in September 2013, firearms officers were allowed to give their evidence anonymously but were repeatedly challenged about their version of the events.

The policeman who fired the fatal shots – identified only as V53 – told how he and his colleagues surrounded Duggan with their guns, and said that he had 'an honest belief he was going to shoot me'. 

He said it was 'complete rubbish' to say Duggan was not armed when he was shot. Another officer – called V59 in the hearings – said it was 'highly offensive' to claim that police had planted a gun at the scene.

The inquest jury returned a verdict of lawful killing on January 8 last year, sparking fresh fury from campaigners. 

In a later report, coroner Keith Cutler said the police had 'created a perception of collusion' by meeting to discuss their statements after the killing.

In October, Duggan's family lost an appeal against the inquest verdict, but at least one Met officer – codenamed ZZ46 – is facing disciplinary action, for not stopping Duggan from obtaining a gun from a supplier. 

The precise circumstances surrounding the disappearance of the disk have not been revealed but a Metropolitan Police spokesman said: 'We have carried out a full risk assessment on the material that we have been informed was on the disk, and have taken the necessary steps. Due to the nature of the material, we are not prepared to discuss what those steps entail.

'The Metropolitan Police Service has offered its full support in attempting to locate the disk.'

The Information Commissioner's Office said: 'We are aware of the case and we are making enquiries.'

It could be one of the most serious Government data losses since October 2007, when two disks containing the personal details of about half the country's population went missing.

Junior staff at HMRC offices in Washington, Tyne and Wear, sent the disks by unregistered post to the National Audit Office but they never reached their destination, prompting then Chancellor Alistair Darling to announce the loss in the Commons, to gasps from MPs.

A Government spokesman said: 'We take all issues relating to data handling seriously. 

'As such, an immediate investigation has been launched and all necessary steps are being taken. 

'It would be inappropriate to comment further until that investigation has taken place.'
