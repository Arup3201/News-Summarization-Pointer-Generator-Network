Shawn Corey Carter: rapper, record producer, businessman – and boxing promoter.

The man more commonly known as Jay Z will be front and centre tonight as he hosts his first show at the Madison Square Garden Theatre in New York.

He will be joined at ringside by his wife Beyonce and pop star Rihanna while the voice of boxing, Michael Buffer, will announce the fights.

Headlining the show will be 20-year-old Dusty Hernandez-Harrison, an unbeaten but largely untested welterweight in his 25th contest. 

And just hours before his first show, world super middleweight champion Andre Ward announced he had joined Jay Z's company.

Ward has been out of action for 14 months but tweeted: 'It's official! Happy to be part of the Roc Nation family.'

But beyond the glamour and razzmatazz that will accompany the nine-fight card lies the story of a man desperate to make his mark in the sport of boxing.

Born and raised in New York, Jay Z, now 45, rose from a housing project in Brooklyn to amass a fortune of $520million (£344m). Along the way he sold one hundred million records, won nine Grammy Awards and is considered one of the greatest rappers of all time.

His business interests include urban clothing company Rocawear, sports bar 40/40 Club in New York and independent record label Block Starz Music.

He has bought and sold stakes in the Barclays Centre and the Brooklyn Nets basketball team and in 2013 launched sports agency Roc Nation Sports which is dedicated to 'elevating athletes’ career on a global scale both on and off the field'.

Athletes currently signed include basketball player Kevin Durant, baseball’s CC Sabathia and American footballers Geno Smith and Victor Cruz.

But it is in boxing that he has attempted to make the biggest splash, although he has thus far encountered his fair share of barriers.

Madison Square Garden has played host to its fair share of iconic fights over the years

Eighteen months after forming the company, Jay Z appointed David Itskowitch as Roc Nation Sports' chief operating officer.

Itskowitch held the same position at Oscar de la Hoya's Golden Boy until last summer and promised to make an 'immediate and dramatic impact on the sport'.

He did just that the very next day, travelling to Puerto Rica with a cheque for $1,904,840 to bid for a middleweight world title fight between champion Peter Quillin and Matt Korobov.

Roc Nation Sports won the purse bid, offering $700,000 more than the next highest bid from Golden Boy.

But Quillin never did fight Korobov, instead opting to vacate his title and wave goodbye to a $1.4m pay day. The answer to the obvious question of 'why' lies in a bitter feud between Jay Z and the mysterious figure of Al-Haymon, boxing manager to the likes of Floyd Mayweather Jnr and Amir Khan.

Haymon, who does not give interviews, also has a background in music, promoting concerts involving the likes of M.C. Hammer, Mary J Blige and Whitney Houston. From RnB to rap and hip hop, Haymon put on 500 shows in 1991 and by 2000 had made the move into boxing.

He is believed to have crossed paths with Jay Z during his time in the music industry but was also named in a law suit filed by Beyonce’s father in 2011.

As well as Mayweather, Haymon can count former world champions Shawn Porter and Adrien Broner, welterweight prospect Keith Thurman and heavyweight knockout sensation Deontay Wilder among his clients.

Roc Nation Sports reportedly offered Wilder $2m for his upcoming fight with WBC belt holder Bermane Stiverne as part of a five-fight deal, only to remove the offer from the table after receiving no response. Thurman, meanwhile, rejected a multi-fight deal worth $6m, telling ESPN: 'Jay Z's company is a young company. I haven't seen them make guys money yet in boxing.

'I want to see [Jay Z] do something with another fighter before I follow. I don't want to fly on the first airplane.'

That first plane will now take off tonight with a star name and earlier this week, Roc Nation Sports announced a merger with Gary Shaw Productions. 

Shaw’s roster includes heavyweight Bryant Jennings who could fight Wladimir Klitschko in New York in April and former world champions Daniel Geale and Jhonatan Romero.

Al Haymon aside, Jay Z's bold arrival on the boxing scene has been well received. Veteran promoter Bob Arum, who represents Manny Pacquiao, backed him to be a ‘great success’ while De La Hoya welcomed ‘Jay Z and Roc Nation to the wonderful sport of boxing’.

Jay Z is not the first musician to dabble in boxing. Curtis Jackson, aka 50 Cent, formed The Money Team (TMT) with Mayweather in 2012 but the relationship lasted just a few months.

He now promotes through his own company, SMS Promotions, but has only a handful of fighters signed, chiefly Cuban lightweight Yuriorkis Gamboa.

Jackson's relationship with Mayweather is now seemingly beyond repair after an unsavoury exchange last year when the rapper claimed his former business partner could not read and insists he is owed $2m.

In his memoir, Decoded, Jay Z wrote: ‘Boxing is a glorious sport to watch and boxers are incredible, heroic athletes, but it's also, to be honest, a stupid game to play. Even the winners can end up with crippling brain damage.

'But you learn something special from playing the most difficult games, the games where winning is close to impossible and losing is catastrophic.'

It’s too early to tell whether the man who once said he could sell water to a well will be one of boxing’s winners, but where better to start than the place dreams are made of?
