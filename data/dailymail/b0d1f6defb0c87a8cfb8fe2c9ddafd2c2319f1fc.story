 A Premier League star has sparked an anti-Semitism row after he tweeted a picture of himself with a ‘Hitler’ moustache.

Liverpool defender, Jose Enrique, proudly posted the image on Twitter revealing that he had shaved his facial hair - which so happens to resemble the German dictator's - to surprise his girlfriend.

And although less than impressed, Amy Jaine happily posed for the picture while smiling and pointing at the former Newcastle United player.

Enrique, 28, jokingly tweeted: ‘Surprised my girlfriend with a new style of beard this morning, She didn't like it very much.. hahahahaha @AmyJaine.'

But the image, which has been shared more than 1,500 times, has caused outrage with Twitter users who have expressed their disbelief.

Adolf Hitler was responsible for killing around six million Jews during his time as leader of Nazi Party

Joakim (@TheHopefullyOne) tweeted: ‘I hope you don’t got [sic] any Jewish followers,’ while Pete (@TheMrTuray) said: ‘what is their [sic] to love about a clueless tweet refereeing [sic] to a fascist dictator like Hitler?’

He added: ‘[It is] offensive/misleading no matter what meaning you put it in, he should know not do it’.

While @TheCescChip wrote ‘Hitler is back’ and Ryan (@RyanMcTrippy) called the new style ‘The Third Enreichue’.

Another user asked the footballer whether his ‘faux pas alarm’ had gone off yet.

But not everyone agrees it is a Hitler-style moustache and Twitter user Morenike Adebayo said it was more of a ‘Charlie Chaplin’ while another thought he looked more like ‘a French waiter’.

The actor and comedian, born in east London in 1889, was better known for his performance in The Great Dictator, in which he satirised Adolf Hitler.

As leader of the Nazi Party, Hitler was responsible for the death of around six million Jews during the Second World War.

Twitter user Joakin replied to the footballer 'I hope you don't got any Jewish followers'

Another person took to the social media site to ask what there is to love about the tweet. He later added that he found it offensive and misleading and said Enrique should 'know not to do it'

Several users referred to his new look as Hitler-esque while some thought he looked more like Charlie Chaplin

@RyanMcTrippy joked  that it was 'The Third Enreichue' and another said he looked like a French waiter
