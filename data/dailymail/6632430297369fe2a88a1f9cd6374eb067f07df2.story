The woman due to become the first African American businesswoman to be boss of a Fortune 500 company has said more women will soon be taking over top jobs in the U.S.

Xerox chief executive Ursula Burns said the business world would be foolish to ignore the large pool of talented women in America's colleges.

'A tidal wave is coming', the 50-year-old told the audience at a Prism awards fundraiser for New York University.

Optimistic: Ursula Burns, the first African American woman to lead a Fortune 500 company, expects more women to take on leading business roles

Ms Burns, who is credited with helping her predecessor save Xerox, said executives would be 'silly 
business people' if they did not draw on the pool of talented women in college soon.

She 
added that the most successful corporations would hire women and minorities, according to  Huffington Post Business.

Although Ms Burns, who was seventh on Fortune's list of the 50 most powerful women in business last year, believes women will play an even greater role in the business world, she despaired at the lack of women in high-level executive positions.

Basically there's been no progress,' Ms Burns, who rose to the top role at Xerox after starting as an intern, said.

Her speech at the luncheon comes amid renewed debate about women's progress in business.

In March Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg said women were being held back by things that were out of their control.

The author of Lean In added that hard work, help and ambition could redress the lack of businesswomen in top positions.

Those remarks came as Yahoo! chief executive Marissa Mayer banned working from home, even though she has a nursery next to her office to help her balance being a mother and a boss.

Ms Burns reflected Ms Sandberg's advice, and encouraged career women to 'be
 the best at what you do and work hard', adding that young people often believe it will be easy to reach the top of their profession.

'They think you can get to this end just participating nine to five,' she said.

A strong work ethic was instilled in 
Ms Burns from an early age. She was raised in a housing project in 
Manhattan by a single mother who worked as a cleaner and ironed clothes 
to help pay for her daughter's education,

Her efforts were rewarded when Ms Burns graduated from Columbia with a masters in mechanical engineering. 

Despite their hard work and ambition, women still face 
barriers to progressing in their careers when it comes to pay and promotions, making only 80 per cent of what their male counterparts earn.

For example, Ms Burns is one of only 21 women who hold the title of an S&P 500 CEO. More than a third of public companies had no woman senior 
officers last year, according to a survey from Catalyst.

At a conference in March, however, Ms Burns told aspiring businesswomen not to have guilt trips about missing out on what their children are doing, adding it's a 'fool’s journey' to try to achieve the perfect work-life balance.

She also warned against taking life too seriously, adding 'Ninety per cent of this stuff is just not that serious,' according to the Wall Street Journal.

The rarity of women in top positions was highlighted when Ms Burns was offered the chief executive role at Xerox from Anne Mulcachy last month.

It was the first woman-to-woman handover for a Fortune 500 company and, when Ms Burns officially takes over on July 1, she will be the first African American woman in the list.

Ms Burns and her predecessor cemented their success by saving Xerox. In the past five years they have halved the company's debt to $7 billion and boosted net earnings.

According to CNN Money, Ms Mulcachy told her to 'figure out how to get $2 billion out' while ensuring Xerox survived to be a company our children could work at.

Her lasting advice for women wanting a leading role in business however is to work for a company or industry they are passionate about.
