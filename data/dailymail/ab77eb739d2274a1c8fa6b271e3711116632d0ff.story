These incredible pictures show how astronauts released the latest tranche of cubesats into orbit around the Earth.

Five of the tiny satellites were placed into orbit from the International Space Station earlier this month, including one designed to flash morse code messages across the night sky.

Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency 
astronaut Aki Hoshide prepared them for deployment via the space 
station's new Small Satellite Orbital Deployer attached to its Japanese 
Experiment Module.

So small: Five cubesats - Raiko, Niwaka, We Wish, TechEdSat and F-1 - were sent into earth obit from ISS this month

They tiny orbiters were carried into space as part 
of the Japanese Kounotori 3 space mission to resupply the ISS, and 
deployed as part of an technology experiment to test the feasilibity of 
releasing satellites without space walks.

Cubesats are a type of miniaturised satellite for space research that usually measure no more than 10cm cubed and with a mass of no more than 1.33kg.

The majority of development of the low-cost satellites comes from academia, and they typically make use commercial, off-the-shelf electronics in their design.

Because of their simplicity, CubeSat forms a cost-effective independent means of getting a payload into orbit.

Most CubeSats carry one or two scientific instruments as their primary mission payload.

Five cubesats - Raiko, Niwaka, We Wish, TechEdSat and F-1 - were sent into earth obit from ISS this month.

Niwaka - aka FITSAT-1 - is designed to twinkle like an artificial star to write messages across the sky that can be visible from Earth.

The tiny orbiter's mission is to 
broadcast the message 'Hi this is Niwaka Japan' in Morse Code, using 
bursts of intense light to draw the dots and dashes across the heavens.

Using high-power LEDs driven by pulses of energy as high as 200W FITSAT-1 will produce flashes of light so bright its makers hope it will be observable with the naked eye or with small binoculars.

It was originally planned to appear only over Japan, but a flurry of interest means that it will now be touring the entire globe.

Launch successful: FITSAT-1 was launched along with two other cubesats from the International Space Station last Thursday

The International Space Station is planning to change its orbit after narrowly avoiding two pieces of space junk last month.

A broken Russian satellite and the remains of an Indian rocket passed within miles of the ISS, with the station primed to move and the astronauts having a tense few hours wondering if disaster was about to strike.

Now, the Russian space program's Mission Control Centre says it will move the ISS into a different orbit to lower the risk of possible collisions.

There is 'no practical aim' to the 
morse code beacons, according to its creator, Professor Takushi Tanaka 
of the Fukuoka Institute of Technology, except to test the possibility 
of optical communication from space.

The FITSAT-1 team say it will try to fulfil all requests for appearances.

However, despite the brightness of its LEDs it cannot be seen through heavy cloud cover, so skywatchers should hope for a clear night if they hope to see it passing above their part of the world.

The 3lb satellite's main mission is to test a high-speed data transmitter which will beam VGA images taken by an onboard camera back to Earth.

Scientists believe their transmitter can send a 480x640 jpeg within 6 seconds.

FITSAT-1 will orbit the earth between 51.6 degrees south latitude and 51.6 degrees north latitude and it will carry a mounted neodymium magnet to force it to always point to magnetic north like a compass.

More information on the FITSAT-1 can be found on its information page on the Fukuoka Institute of Technology's website.
