Joe Hart admits he ‘does not see the positives’ about being out of the Manchester City team after being rested for the last two games.

The England No 1 will return for Tuesday night’s Champions League clash with Roma after seeing No 2 Willy Caballero play in the Capital One Cup tie against Sheffield Wednesday and Saturday’s Premier League win at Hull City.

Sat alongside Manuel Pellegrini at Monday’s pre-match press conference at the Etihad, Hart admitted that he is not happy on the sidelines even for a short period.

‘Of course I want to play every game, that’s my nature, my professionalism,' said the England goalkeeper. 'I always want to play but I’m not the manager, I’m just a player. I live by the decisions of our manager. I think he knows that I’d love to play but he has to make decisions. 

‘When I retire from football I will see the positives but at the moment I don’t.

‘We’ve always had good keepers here since I’ve been here. I’ve always had a fight for me to keep my place and that will continue. 

‘We’ve always had good goalkeepers since I’ve been here – David James, Weaver, Isaakson, Kasper (Schmeichel), Shay Given, Pantilimon, Stuart Taylor.

‘There are always going to be good goalkeepers here and it’s always been a fight for me to keep my place and that will continue but I’ve got high standards that I like to keep to whether I’m the only goalkeeper or one of 20.

‘The challenge excites me. I love playing and that will never change. I’ll continue fighting.’

Hart will come up against his old England team-mate Ashley Cole who left Chelsea to join Roma in the summer. City defender Micah Richards also moved to Serie A with Fiorentina but Hart he has no plans to follow them abroad.

‘I have got a lot of respect for the boys who have done, Micah being closest to home for me,’ said Hart. ‘He seems to be loving it out there but right now I’m happy with what is going on at this club. We are fighting on all fronts. While I am welcome here, I am more than happy to stay here and see where that takes me.

‘It will be great to see Ash. He was brave to make the move to Rome after a great career at Arsenal and Chelsea but it will be good to catch up.’

Although a number of City stars have signed new contracts in recent months, Hart is still waiting on a new deal. However, the champions have indicated that the 27-year-old will be offered new terms in due course.

Hart let Pellegrini answer the question but the City boss insisted that it should not distract from Tuesday’s game.

'Me and Joe know what’s happening with that issue,' said Pellegrini. 'I think it’s important we know how to manage it but it’s not the most important thing at this moment. We are thinking about Roma and how to continue winning and getting points in the Premier League.'

City cannot afford to lose again, having gone down to a 90th-minute goal in Munich earlier this month while Roma beat CSKA Moscow 5-1.

Hart added: ‘It’s obviously a big game after a disappointing start in Munich. We are aware it is the Champions League and not the knockout phase straight away. We have to build on it especially at home and we are going in trying to win the game.

‘Roma have been doing very well. We have focused a lot more on them since they were drawn in our group, and they got a great result in matchday one. Every game is tough in the Champions League but we are up for it and more than capable of winning.

‘Against Bayern we fought hard against one of the stronger teams in Europe. We could have come away with a point or a win but it was not to be. There was a deflected shot in the last minute, but that is football. We need to capitalise now at home.

‘Late goals have cost us in some big games but also shown that we are definitely up there and can play with the big boys and we just need to finish the game off.’
