Internet retailer Amazon employs hundreds of staff on controversial zero-hour contracts subjecting them to harsh working conditions where they wear tags so they can be tracked by bosses, it has been revealed.

Employees working under the contracts are not guaranteed any income but are still subjected to an employment regime that sees them walking up to 15 miles during a shift, while their toilet breaks are monitored and timed. It is also claimed they can be sacked and re-hired.

Amazon has already been criticised by MPs for its tax avoidance practices and could come under further pressure after the strict regime was exposed.

Use of zero-hour contracts has thrived despite calls for them to be banned, with the Office for National Statistics saying that 250,000 British workers were employed in this way at the end of last year by a range of firms, including Sports Direct and even Buckingham Palace.

Former staff at Amazon’s warehouse in Rugeley, Staffordshire, said they were hired for 12 weeks before being sacked and re-employed so that the company did not have to give them the same rights as full-time employees.

Martin Parton, who says he was employed on three different occasions, said: ‘I think they had it all mapped out. They just got rid of you when they felt like it.’

An investigation by Channel 4 News found that employees are tracked using GPS tags while inside the warehouse.

If staff are found to breach any of the company’s rules, such as talking to colleagues or leaving work early, they can be dismissed on a ‘three strikes and you are out’ basis.

Employees also described having to pack 
boxes for the internet delivery company over a ten-hour shift with just a
 30-minute break, in which they often had to walk the length of the 
factory – the size of nine football pitches – to reach its canteen.

Many of the former staff who worked inside the factory were employed by Randstad, an employment agency that until February was used to bring in workers and manage them on behalf of Amazon.

A whistleblower from the agency told Channel 4 News he was instructed to be ‘very careful’ about sacking temporary employees in case the information was leaked to the media.

Andrew Kingsley, a former Randstad representative, also said Amazon bosses tried to save money by encouraging the agency to deceive staff by not offering holiday pay. ‘The agency reps were instructed not to tell them,’ he said.

Speaking about the use of tracking equipment on staff, he said: ‘They were monitored every minute on the performance console.

‘You could log on at any time and see what people were picking, packing, and what their rates were. If their rates weren’t up to scratch you’d have to go and give them a bit of a boost or release them.’

One former zero-hour contract employee said: ‘You could turn in for work at seven in the morning and be sent home at eight.’

An Amazon spokesman said: ‘In Rugeley, we have 401 permanent associates, 345 of whom started on temporary assignments.

'We expect to hire an additional 250 permanent associates in Rugeley in the next year. All our agencies are contractually obliged to pay holiday pay and that is accounted for in the amounts we pay to agencies.

‘We continue to listen to feedback from associates, as well as customers, in order to learn, innovate and improve.’

Amazon added that it employs more than 4,500 permanent employees in the UK.
