Two men are being questioned by police after a retired corrections officer fatally shot a 32-year-old man at a Brooklyn subway station following an argument during rush hour, authorities said.

Gilbert Drogheo, from Harlem, was rushed to hospital after being shot on the mezzanine section of the Borough Hall station at 6.30pm on Tuesday but later passed away in hospital.

Two other men, Drogheo's 29-year-old friend and the retired corrections officer, who is 69, were taken into custody on Tuesday night and were being questioned on Wednesday, police said.

A cell phone video obtained by CBS New York revealed the moment the officer allegedly shot and fatally wounded Drogheo. 

Altercation: Cell phone footage taken by a witness and shared with CBS New York shows an older man approaching a younger man at the subway station and getting into a scuffle before a shot is heard

Terrifying: A blurred figure can be seen near to where the altercation occurred on Tuesday evening

Police told the New York Times that the argument began when the ex-officer, who was armed with a 9-millimeter handgun, stepped between the two friends as they had a conversation on the train.

The clash turned physical and one of the younger men spit on the ex-officer, police told the Times.  

Another witness told the New York Daily News he overheard one of the assailants use a racial slur in addressing the older man, telling him: 'I got you now, my n*****.'

'[The older man] said, "I'm not your n*****, I'm not your boy,”' the witness told the paper.

The station PIX11 also reported that two young men were acting ‘belligerent’ on their Brooklyn bound 5 train.

When the train reached the platform at Borough Station in Downtown Brooklyn, the three men separated.

Emergency: Ambulances carry away an injured man; Gilbert Drogheo was pronounced dead in hospital after he was shot in the torso and the ex-corrections officer was taken away for treatment for a minor injury

Rush hour shooting: A 32-year-old man was fatally shot by a retired corrections officer during the shooting

But in footage captured by a witness and shared with CBS2, the older man can be seen walking up stairs from the platform to the mezzanine level before encountering one of the younger men.

The two exchange words and the older man apparently pushes the younger man, the video shows. Just seconds later, a shot is heard.

Drogheo was shot in the torso. Other images captured by witnesses and shared with NBC show a man on the ground.

He was rushed to Brooklyn Hospital Center, where he was pronounced dead.

The former corrections officer, who has not been named, remained at the scene and was taken by police to Long Island College Hospital for treatment.

Neither man has been named and no charges have been filed but both are being questioned.

Deadly confrontation: Witnesses said the fight began when the older man stepped between two men

Fight: The 69-year-old gunman was reportedly heard telling his opponents, 'don't touch me' before the brawl 

Tempers flare: The 69-year-old former jail guard got on the crowded train at Bowling Green station and was trying to walk past the duo when some words were exchanged

Witnesses described the chaotic scene after hearing the gunshot ricochet through the station during one of the busiest travel times of the day. 

Fatima Manuel told CBS she was confused by the sound at first.

'Like a "pow, pow" sound,' she said. 'Sounded like a firecracker, but then I said: "No, that's not a firecracker. That's more like a gunshot".'.

Another subway user, Donny Dushi, added: 'It's the scariest thing to even hear about. Wherever you are in the city - regardless if it’s Brooklyn, the city, Queens, just knowing the transportation you take every day, it can happen to anybody.'

Police say the circumstances of the shooting were still being investigated. 

Trains bypassed the station after the incident but all entrances at the station had re-opened by 4am on Wednesday. 

Service disruption: No 4 and 5 trains initially bypassed the Brooklyn station but are now running normally
