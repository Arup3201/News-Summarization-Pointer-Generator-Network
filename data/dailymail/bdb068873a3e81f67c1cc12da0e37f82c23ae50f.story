Ten years ago, Andy Lee walked into the Mandalay Bay arena in Las Vegas, Nevada as an Olympian but tantalised by the lure of professional boxing and the fickle riches it promises.

Now, just two days on from the 10th anniversary of that first visit to the Bright Light City, he steps into a Vegas ring determined to finally fulfil his dream of becoming a world champion.

At the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas arena, the 30-year-old Limerick middleweight takes on fellow southpaw Matt Korobov, a 31-year-old Russian, for the vacant WBO world championship.

A decade on from being invited to watch Vitali Klitschko’s heavyweight title defence against Danny Williams by former trainer Emmanuel ‘Manny’ Steward, the Limerick native may live up to his old coach’s predictions after an eight-and-a-half year pro career.

Hailed by the late and legendary Steward as his ‘left-handed Tommy Hearns’, Lee was tipped as a champion in waiting from the day he moved to Detroit’s Kronk Gym, eventually making his pro debut in March, 2006.

Having gone unbeaten in 15 fights, a surprise 2008 loss to Texan Brian Vera upset his original title plans before the defeat was avenged three years later. But a seventh-round 2012 stoppage loss to then WBC champion Julio Cesar Chavez in his first title shot — with Lee halted on his feet — made many question Steward’s predication.

‘It’s gone fast but it’s been good and it’s all been necessary to get me to this point,’ says Lee on his 33-2 career. ‘All those experiences and all those years are needed physically and mentally to get to the point where I am now. I feel it’s the right time.

‘It’s almost 10 years ago to the day that I came here first to Las Vegas as a guest with Emmanuel. Ten years later, here I am, I’m going to fight for the world title so it’s been good in a roundabout way. It’s been 10 years and it’s time to do it.’

His determination to seize the moment is bolstered by the confidence he has gained since coming under the tutelage of Adam Booth, who trained David Haye to become unified cruiserweight world champion and later WBA heavyweight champion.

During his rebuilding process after the loss to Chavez, Lee’s form was hard to judge with two knockout wins over weak opposition bookended by sluggish points wins over middling fighters.

His most recent victory, however — a fifth-round knockout of John Jackson (son of two-weight world champ Julius) — not only became an internet sensation, it also suggested Lee’s ability had not wavered despite the fact that Jackson had earlier put him on the canvas for the first time in his career.

‘I feel like I’m boxing better than I ever have — like a seasoned professional,’ says the 30-year-old. ‘I’m still young enough to have the hunger and the enthusiasm, especially since I’ve been two years with Adam. It’s been a new challenge for me and it’s really refreshed me. Going to the gym every day and not knowing what I’m [going to be] doing, learning and improving every day. Now it’s time. I’m in my prime — if not now than never.

‘A lot of it [the slow rebuilding process] was intentional because I was still learning and it was a whole new thing training with Adam so I had to adjust to that so time was needed. This is the right time for me to fight and become a world champion.’

Standing in his way is the undefeated Korobov (24-0), a former two-time amateur world champion. A pugilistic paradox which makes the fight so unpredictable is the fact that, since turning pro in 2008, Korobov has yet to fight any opposition comparable to that which he faced as an amateur.

‘He is a good boxer. I know he hasn’t been that sensational [as a pro] but he’s beaten everybody he’s fought and has amateur pedigree,’ says Lee. ‘But I believe I have better basics than him. I’ve developed as a professional more so than he has. If anything, he’s gone backwards, he’s not the fighter he was as an amateur or at that level, comparatively as a professional. I see a good fighter but I don’t see one who can box consistently for 12 rounds.

‘He hasn’t fought a really meaningful fight that he has a good chance of losing, so that’s going to play on his mind. I’ve been in this situation so many times before where the outcome of the fight is uncertain. He’s going to find it to be his first really hard fight as a professional and I’m going to ask a lot of questions of him that he hasn’t been asked yet.

‘My aim is to match him all the way in the early rounds, be there with him, box him and come on strong going down the stretch.

‘That’s the way I see the fight going,’ says Lee, hinting at the bout going the distance, but adds: ‘He might try to come out and make a statement and try to bang me out of it and if he does, I’ll look forward to that because I’ll bang straight with him and whoever comes out of it will come out of it. My chin is proven and my power is proven.’
