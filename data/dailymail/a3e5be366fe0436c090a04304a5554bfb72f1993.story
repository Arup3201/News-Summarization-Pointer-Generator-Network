West Ham goalkeeper Adrian produced an outstanding performance against Arsenal on Saturday even though he was playing with a dislocated finger.

His team lost 3-0 but the Spaniard produced a string of outstanding saves from Theo Walcott, Aaron Ramsey, Alexis Sanchez and then from Danny Welbeck in the last minute to prevent his team from a heavier defeat.

And assistant manager Neil McDonald revealed afterwards that Adrian had dislocated his finger in the warm up but had insisted on playing on.

McDonald said: ‘He’s been a brave lad today because he could easily have pulled out. And he’s made some great saves. He has his finger strapped up to play and I’m hoping that if he played today he should allright for next week

‘He did it in the warm-up but he wanted to carry on. I haven’t ever dis-located my finger so I don’t know how much pain he was in but it’s obviously a big thing for a goalkeeper.’ 

After defeat at Arsenal Sam Allardyce's side are now tenth in the Premier League, having won just once in their past 12 matches.
