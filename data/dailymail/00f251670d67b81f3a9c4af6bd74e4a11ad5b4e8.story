Andy Murray appears to have confirmed the latest left field move of his career by signing with American sports clothing firm Under Armour.

The ex Wimbledon champion has been pictured wearing the skin tight top of the brand during his current training stint in Miami.

As Sportsmail revealed on Tuesday, the US company have made an unexpected move for his major apparel deal after his five-year contract with Adidas was not renewed.

They are best known in the UK for kitting out Tottenham Hotspur but their tennis involvement has been strictly limited.

Among their few sponsorships in the sport have been Americans Sloane Stephens and Robby Ginepri.

No formal announcement has yet been made but one is expected before Christmas.

The financial commitment is likely to be a long way short of the estimated £3million annual payment from Adidas, partly because he seems sure to continue using their shoes.
