'A complete sniper experience,' boasts a quote from another website on its box. And indeed, if running around linear levels blasting hordes of samey-looking enemies is representative of real life then they have a point.

Sadly, the only thing realistic about City Interactive's Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 is its commendable ballistics. But even these can't hide its over-simplistic gameplay.

Looks can be deceiving: Environments in Ghost Warrior are there primarily to show off the CryEngine 3 but there's no hiding the mundane gameplay 

The almost non-existent plot follows the exploits of Private Security Consultant Captain Cole Anderson who travels around the world sniping bad guys.

More often than not, gameplay requires you to remain hidden for as long as possible. You'll either be working with a spotter or sneak around by yourself. The latter is slightly more enjoyable given the horrendous macho 'banter' that plagues proceedings when with your ally.

You're encouraged to scan areas before taking targets down, factoring in wind speed, direction and distance and it is satisfying scoring a direct, well-thought-out hit. There's even a slow-motion bullet cam that shows off particularly good kills.

Sadly, it feels all too much like an extended and overly boring version of the Modern Warfare sniper sections.

Even signature parts where you provide cover from elevated positions feel nothing more than glorified shooting galleries. Stealth sections, too, are just more of the same - albeit with a pistol and are ruined by inconsistencies in AI and cover. Whereas hiding in a bush works in one part, enemies may see you through the foliage in another.

The game also punishes you for straying away from its defined boundaries. Wander off the beaten track or fire when not prompted and you'll be killed in an instant. Call of Duty games boast similar rigidity in level design but hide it behind smoke and mirrors - a trick Ghost Warrior 2 hasn't learned.

Trial and error: There are some sections where you have to use night vision, but it doesn't stop the game feeling like a shooting gallery

It's not all negative, though. Compared to its muddy, drab predecessor, Ghost Warrior 2 is a good looking game. It's lost that 'budget' look thanks to the CryEngine 3 - especially on PC.

The testing unit's Nvidia 680GTX graphics card allowed the game to run at the maximal 'very high' settings, resulting in some of the larger expanses looking fantastic.

Closer inspection, though, reveals muddy, bland textures and character models look flat and uninspired. Equally uninspired is the multiplayer, offering two maps and a single Deathmatch mode. Still, there's a lot for 'campers' to enjoy here.

But enjoyment is something of a rarity in Ghost Warrior 2 - a game that tried so hard but still missed the target.
