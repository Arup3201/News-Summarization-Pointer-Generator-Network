When launched in 2006, the Emma Maersk shipping container was the world's largest of its kind ever built.

And now these stunning photographs show just how huge the massive vessel is.

Built by the A. P. Moller-Maersk Group, the ship measured 397 m (1,302 ft)long, its beam measured 56 m (184 ft), its draught is 16.02 m (52.6 ft) and it reached a depth of 30 m (98 ft).

Named after Emma Mærsk, Mærsk Mc-Kinney Møller's late wife, it can carry up to 170,794 gross tonnes, and can reach speeds of 25.5 knots (29.3 mph).

The biggest boat: Measuring in at almost a quarter-mile long, it can carry more cargo than a 41-mile-long train

Gloomy: The vast amount of cargo seen here shows the huge capacity the shipping container has

The main engine of a PS-class vessel such as the EMMA MÆRSK produces 109,000 horsepower, equal to that of 1,156 family cars

The yawning proportions of the ship make it difficult to comprehend - but one photographer took the opportunity to try and capture the dimensions of the vessel

Her maiden voyage took her from Aarhus, stopping by Gothenburg,Algeciras, the Suez Canal, before landing in Singapore in just three weeks during 2006.

She made headlines that year when she was nicknamed SS Santa because she carried tonnes of Christmas goods from China to the UK.

Professional German photographer Jakob Wagner took pictures of the massive ship and compiled them into a photo series of his own dubbed Container, PetaPixel reported.

He captured the life of the container - from the loading of the ship's cargo in Rotterdam, to it's 100-mile journey across the English Channel to Felixstowe, and the daily routine and sights. 

Making waves: Combined, the accommodation and bridge of a PS-class vessel are as high as a twelve-storey building

Wagner successfully completed his three-year apprenticeship as a photographer in 2008.

He lives in Duesseldorf, where he mainly works as a freelance photographer, image editor and photo assistant.

His work has taken him to many different countries around the world - including the middle east, Carribean and China.

Maersk Line is the core liner shipping business of the A.P. Moller – Maersk Group, and one of the leading container shipping companies in the world.

The Maersk Line fleet comprises more than 600 vessels and a number of containers corresponding to more than 4,100,000 TEU (Twenty foot Equivalent Unit – a container 20 feet long).

In theory, a PS-vessel like the Emma Mærsk could transport approximately 528 million bananas in a single voyage - enough to give every person in Europe or North America a banana for breakfast

She is one of eight E-class containers owned by the A. P. Moller-Maersk Group. When she was launched in 2006, she was the largest container ship ever built

A single 20-foot container can hold about 48,000 bananas. So, in theory, a PS-vessel like the Emma Mærsk could transport approximately 528 million bananas in a single voyage - enough to give every person in Europe or North America a banana for breakfast.

The main engine of a PS-class vessel such as the Emma Maersk produces 109,000 horsepower, equal to that of 1,156 family cars, the company's official website claimed.

Combined, the accommodation and bridge of a PS-class vessel are as high as a twelve-storey building.

In February, MAERSK Line ordered the largest ships in its fleet to stop using their stern thrusters until investigators discover what caused a flood that left Emma Maersk’s engineroom under 18 m of water in an incident near the Suez Canal.

Making Emma Maersk seaworthy again is a complicated process, and the company said it is probably a matter of months before she can enter service again.
