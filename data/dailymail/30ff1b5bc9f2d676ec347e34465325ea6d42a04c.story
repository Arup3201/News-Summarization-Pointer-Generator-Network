Two high school students died on their way home from a movie theater in after a faulty exhaust pipe leaked carbon monoxide into their car.

Carly Marie Imbierowicz, 16, and Daulton David Pointek, 17, were found dead early Saturday morning in a parked car near Cochranville, Pennsylvania.

A preliminary toxicology report found that both teens died from carbon monoxide poisoning, but there is no indication of suspicious activities or suicide.

Tragedy: Carly Marie Imbierowicz, 16, was found dead in a car with her friend Daulton David Pointek, 17, after a faulty exhaust pipe had leaked deadly carbon monoxide into the vehicle

The teenagers had visited a cinema with friends in nearby Downingtown on Friday night, and Mr Pointek was driving Ms Imbierowicz home, Pennsylvania State Police Avondale have said. 

The pair, both students at Octorara High School, pulled over by the roadside, where their bodies were discovered by a passerby on Saturday morning.

Life lost: 'Sports fan' Daulton David Pointek

Family has described Ms Imbierowicz as a 'talented athlete' who played for the varsity field hockey team as well as the school's volleyball, softball and powderpuff football teams.

An obituary published by a local funeral home also notes that she was the junior class vice-president, vice-president of Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA), volunteered at a local hospital and was a cadet in the Civil Air Patrol

Mr Pointek has also been described as an athlete who participated in golf, baseball and basketball at Octorara High School and loved sports and cars.

'It hit our community hard but it united us. We're hoping it goes back to normal but nothing is going to be normal,' fellow student Hannah Keenan told WPVI-TV.

'I saw her [Ms Imbierowicz] that Friday night because her mom had just gotten surgery and I was dropping food off.

'We said our goodbyes but I didn't think that would be our final goodbye.' 

'It was definitely something we never expected to happen,' Octorara High School principal Scott Rohrer added.

'The odds are just astronomical, I just can't imagine. It's really difficult to comprehend.'

The police investigation is ongoing.
