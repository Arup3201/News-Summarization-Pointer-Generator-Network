Google must move its mystery barge from a construction site on an island in the middle of the San Francisco Bay because the permits are not in order, a state official said Monday.

The notice came after the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission investigated numerous complaints about the construction of the floating, four-story building, commission executive director Larry Goldzband said.

The investigation found that neither the Treasure Island Development Authority nor the city of San Francisco had applied for required permits for the work to be done at the site.

Barge out: A state agency says Google must move its mystery barge from a construction site on an island in the middle of the San Francisco Bay because the permits are not in order

Goldzband said Google can resolve the issue by moving the barge to one of the fully permitted construction facilities in the San Francisco Bay.

'It needs to move,' he said.

Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Preliminary planning documents submitted to the port last fall showed plans for Google to build an interactive space for people to learn about technology.

Has to move: Google is erecting a four-story structure in the heart of the San Francisco Bay but is managing to conceal its purpose by constructing it on docked barges instead of on land, where city building permits and public plans are mandatory

Mystery buildings: The barge is one of three mysterious floating structures that have sparked online speculation. There are three secretive structures, two in San Francisco and one Portland, Maine

The documents ended months of speculation that the barge would be a party boat, data storage center or a store for Google to sell its Internet-connected glasses.

Google has had little to say about the barge or another vessel off the East Coast.

In November, the company issued a statement that said, 'Although it's still early days and things may change, we're exploring using the barge as an interactive space where people can learn about new technology.'

Goldzband said the construction in San Francisco Bay was not authorized by the agency, and the Treasure Island Development Authority, which allowed the project, could face fines and enforcement proceedings.

The disclosure by the California agency marked the second set of permit problems for the barge project. Late last year, work was halted after the Coast Guard said additional permits were needed.
