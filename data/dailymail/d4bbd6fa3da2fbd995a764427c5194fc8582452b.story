The brother of an apparent street beggar who became an internet star for spending $100 on food for other people claims his 'mentally unstable' sibling chose to be homeless and is awaiting a $150,000 inheritance.

Kevin Nickel also said the man the internet knows as Thomas - whose online donation kitty has received more than $135,000 from members of the public - is actually named Kenneth Nickel, or Kenny, and that he wants people to know 'it's all a scam' so that the donated money can go to those who actually need it.

'He's sitting on money - he's sitting on an estate,' Mr Nickel told CBS Los Angeles.

'He chose this way of life.

'This money needs to go to real people - people who have fallen down.'

Mr Nickel says his brother is an alcoholic who lived with their parents up until their death recently, and that he is waiting on $150,000 from their estate. 

He suggested his sibling chose to live on the streets as he waits for the money.

Mr Nickel also said his brother recently spent some time in jail after being arrested for public intoxication. 

However he believes that his sibling may have been 'manipulated' into filming the video. 

The claims come after a witness spoke out about seeing the filming of the video by YouTube prankster Josh Paler Lin, who claims to have given 'Thomas' $100 cash and then secretly followed him to a liquor store, where he bought food and gave it to homeless people in a park.

Nursing student Taugan Tan Kadalim, 26, said he was outside the liquor store on the day in question and he saw Paler Lin - who he recognized from his previous videos - in the driver's seat of a car.

In the passenger seat, he claims, was Thomas. 

'I was there, they didn’t ‘follow’ him,' Kadalim told CBS.

'They drove him there (to the liquor store). 

'I think the manner in how they portrayed the entire video is deceitful and dishonest.'

A spokesperson for Paler Lin told The Daily Mail on Friday that Kevin Nickel's statements to the media are 'totally untrue'.

'The video wants not staged,' the spokesperson, Imal Wagner, said.

Thomas gave an interview to Fox LA insisting that to him it was 'all a surprise' and he had never met Josh before he was handed the $100. 

Gesture ... with an agenda? Skeptics have picked holes in a viral video showing a homeless man spending a $100 donation on food for his beggar friends, deeming it a 'fake' creation that was focused on making money

He told the news channel: 'I appreciate it, most definitely. It's all a surprise to me. I thought this was just a project video, I had no idea this was going where it went.

Thomas added: 'Normally people give you a dollar, maybe five as a big tip, but a hundred, wow that's a week's worth. Crazy.'

Paler Lin said he initially set out to 'expose homeless people' in Los Angeles by giving them cash in the expectation that they will spend it on alcohol.

However, Thomas proved to be an exception. Instead, he spent the money on food to share with his friends, prompting Paler Lin to return and surprise Thomas with a Christmas meal, makeover and a night in a hotel.

The feel-good video spawned an Indiegogo page - believed to be run by Paler Lin - for Thomas to get his life back on track, which as of Friday had a total of $135,028.

But critics have pointed to a number of flaws in the footage, as well as the hefty profit Paler Lin has reportedly made from its success - up to a huge $52,000.

YouTube users have been skeptical about Paler Lin's motivation, suggesting it is a 'set-up' so he can gain traffic and profit.

One YouTube user, with the handle ClemtheRanter, said: 'A large number of YouTube prank videos are staged,' he said. 'I was involved in a bloody eyeball scare prank by Josh Paler Lin. My part of the video was staged... me getting scared by Josh.

Twist: The short film sees 'serial prankster' Josh Paler Lin give $100 to a beggar named Thomas in Los Angeles, California - only for him to walk into a Liquor Mart (left) and buy food for his struggling friends (right)

'I asked him if he could give me a shout-out and put my name in the description below so I can get some traffic to my YouTube channel, but it never happened.

'So now i'm addressing this issue due to a number of YouTube pranksters getting exposed for making stage pranks.' 

Other users have claimed that homeless feel-good films are a sure-fire way of boosting traffic - and consequently, money, via advertisements - on the social networking site.

'They go to a homeless person and make a feel-good video because they know that's going to get views,' said one YouTube user, referring to the site's personalities, such as Paler Lin.

Skepticism: Now, viewers have questioned the video's authenticity, citing a number of 'flaws' in the footage. Above, Lin is pictured in a Facebook photo. He is well-known for producing 'prank' videos for YouTube

Indeed, in November 2013, Paler Lin gave another homeless man $100 and told an actor playing a beggar to approach him to ask for money for food. Again, the real beggar handed over some cash.

The user, with the handle '24/7 rants', claimed the start of Paler Lin's recent homeless video - which sees the director hand Thomas $100, before secretly following him with a camera - immediately suggests it may be a hoax.

Speaking in his own video, he said Paler Lin could not possibly have guaranteed the man was going to pick up his things and spend the money immediately, instead of remaining by the roadside.

'How did he know he was going to spend the money immediately? He had no idea,' he said. 

He also picked holes in the claim that Thomas did not notice the camera - nor Paler Lin (who has a distinctive haircut) - following him throughout the duration of his trip to a nearby Liquor Mart. 

After shopping at the Mart, Thomas was filmed emerging with bags filled with food, before going straight to a park, where he handed out the goods to a number of homeless people.

Wit his new look and wardrobe, Thomas was treated to a buffet meal at the end of the day by Paler Lin 

However, the user questioned the beggar's choice of a Liquor Mart a 34-minute walk away for his food shop - instead of a nearer, cheaper supermarket - saying: 'It seems like an odd coincidence'.

'Why would this guy, of all places, go to a liquor store to buy chips and pie or whatever when you think that there are tons of other places to go to... that are convenient, probably cheaper. 

However, Paler Lin argued that Thomas chose the liqour store because it was closest to his begging spot, saying: 'When people see you getting all this traffic they want to bring you down.'

When questioned by DailyMail.com, he did not explain why Thomas chose to drag several bags of food 34 minutes to the park, instead of shopping at least two stores that were closer to the park.

But he strongly denied staging any of his films or having met Thomas before the $100 exchange.  

'I had little expectation, maybe he would buy alcohol maybe he wouldn't,' he said of the video. 'I wanted to see what a homeless person would spend it on. No one has ever done that before.'

However, the YouTube user claimed the number of hits received by Paler Lin's previous YouTube videos - between 600,000 to 800,000, according to socialblade.com, a site that tracks YouTube channel statistics - could have prompted him to construct what he knew would be a viral hit.

Indeed, Paler Lin - who earns money based on how many users view his videos, most of which are 'pranks' - not only scooped $52,000 from the film, but also gained 13,000 new subscribers.  

After the video went viral, Paler Lin said on YouTube: 'I wasn't expecting to get this kind of footage. To be honest, I thought this video would be more an exposing homeless people video at first.'  

He added: 'I'm so glad that I could witness and capture such a beautiful moment. This has to be one of the most amazing experience so far on this channel. 

In the footage, Thomas told Paler Lin he had quit his job to look after his parents, but after both of them died, he couldn't afford to pay for their condo and found himself on the street.   

'The more I talk to him, the more I sense how genuine he is…. I gave him my number and told him to call me when he needs help. Never judge a book by its cover. One love!' Paler Lin said.
