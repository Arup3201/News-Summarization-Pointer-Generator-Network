Arsene Wenger is not intending to sign a replacement for injured striker Olivier Giroud - with Besiktas match-winner Alexis Sanchez proving he is more than capable of leading the line for the Gunners.

Giroud underwent ankle surgery on Wednesday afternoon and could be sidelined until the new year, with Arsenal already linked to a number of targets to come in and take over from the 27-year-old.

But it was summer recruit Sanchez who scored the only goal of a tense Champions League play-off as Wenger sealed a 17th consecutive season in the group stages of the competition despite having Mathieu Debuchy sent off in the second half.

Not panicking: Arsene Wenger says he doesn't need to buy another striker

The Chile international scored his first Arsenal goal on the stroke of half-time and Wenger was delighted with his overall performance.

'I bought him to play as a striker, not to only play on the flanks,' the Frenchman said of Sanchez. 

'He had a good game, not only on the technical side but on the fighting side.

'He was mobile and dangerous and showed he has great fighting spirit - qualities which will be important in the Premier League.'

As well as Sanchez, Wenger also has Yaya Sanago, Joel Campbell and Lukas Podolski at his disposal, while Theo Walcott is another option in attack although he is also currently injured.

Wenger denied any interest in Nikola Zigic or Manchester United's Danny Welbeck and insisted he would not panic buy following the set-back with Giroud

Asked about the possibility of signing the 6ft 7in Serbian, Wenger responded: Who? Zigic? No.

'You will ask me straight away who we will buy. I give you the answer - at the moment, no-one,' he said. 

'If you want to make everyone happy you buy all of these players but what is important is the performance on the football pitch. If you look at the players we had on the bench and those out injured, we have players. You cannot buy every time a player is injured.

'We are open for any position as long as we feel the player can strengthen the squad. Buy to buy? I don't see the purpose of that.'
