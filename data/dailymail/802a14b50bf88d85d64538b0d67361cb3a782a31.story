While fans flocked to Berlin on Tuesday to great their German World Cup heroes, Nico Rosberg will show his support in a different way.

The Mercedes driver, and Sportsmail columnist, has revealed a new race helmet fit with the Jules Rimet and four stars.

Rosberg will sport the design at this weekend's German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, looking to build on his world championship lead.

'This will be my Hockenheim World Cup special edition helmet with the FIFA trophy. How do you like it???'

He has strong bond with the Monaco circuit, but will hope to have the support of his home fans as he looks to fend off the challenge of Lewis Hamilton.

The talented duo have built up quite a rivalry this season despite their team allegiances, and won't be caught at the top.

But Rosberg will hope he can cap a fine sporting month for Germany with a race win on Sunday.

The 29-year-old recently got married to long-term girlfriend Vivian Sibold in Monaco.

'We are over the Moon,' Rosberg said. 'It was very special to share our wedding day with our closest friends and family.'
