They are some of the animal kingdom's most feared predators, known for their ferocity and killer instinct. 

But a zoo in Wuhan, in Hubei Province, China, allowed visitors this week to get up close and personal with these lion cubs which will grow into some of the most dangerous animals in the world. 

And if this picture is anything to go by, the cute lion cubs were in a playful mood.

Despite being the stars of the zoo, when it came to having their photograph taken they were not quite ready, instead pulling faces at the camera. 

Grinning at the lens, one cub appeared to be all smiles showing off his set of pearly white teeth while his friend looked on.

Lion cubs are born with brown rosette spots on their body rather like a leopard although these fade as they reach adulthood.

Male lions can grow up to around six-and-a-half foot in length and weigh between 265 and 420lbs.

The event was organised to mark International Children's Day on June 1 when tourists can visit the four-month-old cubs at the zoo.

International Children's Day honours children around the world and aims to protect children from working long hours in dangerous circumstances and to allow children access to education.

Wuhan Zoo is found behind the Moshui Lake in Wuhan. Animals found there include giant pandas, zebras, wolves, red pandas hippos, Bengal tigers and even African elephants.
