The prospect of a British bombing campaign against ISIS fanatics in Iraq took a step closer today after Ed Miliband suggested Labour could back airstrikes without official UN backing.

The Labour leader said a military assault on the terror group needed regional and global support and ‘a base in international law’. But he stopped short of demanding a full UN resolution authorising military action.

Mr Miliband’s remarks come as David Cameron prepares to travel to New York to urge world leaders at the UN to tackle the ISIS terrorists slaughtering civilians across the Middle East.

Labour leader Ed Miliband did not rule out backing military action against ISIS during an interview with Andrew Marr at the BBC's Media City in Salford this morning

There is increasing speculation that Parliament may be recalled on Thursday after the Labour Party conference to authorise airstrikes.

The Prime Minister needs Labour support to pass a Commons motion giving him the authority to join a US-led bombing campaign.

Mr Cameron will meet President Barack Obama at the UN and could formally be asked to join airstrikes aimed at "degrading and destroying" Isis.

The PM will use his speech at the UN to accelerate the formation of a coalition to fight Isis. "He will talk about the need to act and the importance of an international response to tackle their poisonous ideology," said a senior Downing Street source.

Britain will also join America in passing a UN security council resolution urging all countries to tackle the problem of foreign fighters travelling abroad to join the terrorists.

ISIS released a video of British journalist John Cantlie following the murder of fellow captive David Haines. UK aid worker Alan Henning has also been threatened

America has already carried out more than 
170 airstrikes against Isis targets in Iraq and was joined for the first
 time by French jets in attacks on Friday.

Britain has 
signalled a willingness to become involved in an air campaign in Iraq 
but has reservations about taking action in neighbouring Syria.

Michael
 Fallon, the defence secretary, will travel to Saudi Arabia and Bahrain 
this week to build up support for military action against Isis.

Speaking
 on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show this morning, Mr Miliband said he would 
weigh up any proposal for military action – but suggested he was 
prepared to back airstrikes.

He
 said: ‘ISIL is a murderous organisation. And their barbaric acts not 
just against British people but also the Christians, Yazidis and so on 
shock us all.

‘My
 judgement about this is that we’ve got to make sure that we assemble 
the alliance right across the world – including in the region – to 
counter them.

‘The means action in Iraq to include the Sunni minorities who’ve often felt excluded. It means mobilising the region.’

He added that it should have a ‘base in international law’ and have ‘clear objectives’.

He said: ‘As a person who wants to be the Prime Minister in eight months, I am going to judge any proposal that comes forward on those criteria.

‘We opposed action in Syria because we didn’t feel it met those criteria. That was about chemical weapons and in fact there was another way of dealing with those chemical weapons. They have now largely been dealt with.’

He added: ‘We’ve got to test any decision to take military action against a criteria I’ve set out. We’ve learnt the lessons of the Iraq war – which is that military action has to be a last resort.’

‘It’s definitely got to have a base in international law. You’ve got to make sure, in any action that you take that you have that regional and international support. And you also have a plan and clear objectives.’
