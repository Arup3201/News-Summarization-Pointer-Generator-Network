Discount hotel chain Travelodge has apologised and offered refunds to guests whose overnight stay was disrupted when a huge water tank burst and a roof caved in.

Thomas and Jennifer Weatherstone, from Carlisle, Cumbria, said they suffered a holiday nightmare when they and their young children – five-year-old Isla, four-year-old Harry and two-year-old Felix – were suddenly awakened by a fire alarm late at night at the Travelodge Oxford Peartree in Cutteslowe, just north of Oxford.

The family was forced to move to a different room after waiting hours in the middle of the night, while other guests had to travel up to 30 miles away, and isn’t satisfied with the way Travelodge handled their situation. 

Nightmare: Thomas and Jennifer Weatherstone and their children were awakened by an alarm late at night

The Weatherstones put their children - Felix, Harry and Isla - in their car while they waited for a room

Guests were roused from their beds at about 11pm when a rooftop storage tank ruptured and water began to gush into the building.

Mrs Weatherstone, 30, said: ‘I woke up again at midnight and when I opened the door to look into the corridor, part of the ceiling collapsed.

‘It was in the corridor about two rooms down from us, and water was coming through the hole in the ceiling.’

The Weatherstones loaded their children into their car and went to the front desk to find out what was going on.

Hotel staff told them the section of the building where they were staying had been deemed dangerous and they wouldn’t be allowed to spend the rest of the night in their room.

Mrs Weatherstone said: ‘At no point through the whole thing did anyone tell us to evacuate.’ 

Because there was limited availability in the rest of the hotel, guests who were staying in 47 rooms in the ‘dangerous’ area were forced to go to Travelodge hotels in Bicester and High Wycombe.

After waiting more than three hours, the Weatherstones, who were visiting family in Faringdon, were told they could have a single room in the ‘safe section’ of the hotel, but there was only one bed for the family of five.

Sorry: Travelodge has apologised and offered full refunds and compensation to guests

Mrs Weatherstone said: ‘There was no seating, no refreshments, no information, no apology, nothing. It was very unprofessional.

‘We were planning on staying for another night but we just got in the car in the morning and drove home with hardly any sleep. I feel so angry.’

Travelodge has since apologised and given the family a £39 refund, £100 in vouchers and £175 in compensation.

Company spokeswoman Sophia Mead said the fire alarm went off three times, the hotel was evacuated and the situation was explained to guests.

She said: ‘The water tank was fixed the following day and all customers staying at the hotel that night have been refunded in full and compensated.

‘We would like to assure Mrs Weatherstone that the safety of our customers and staff is paramount to us.’
