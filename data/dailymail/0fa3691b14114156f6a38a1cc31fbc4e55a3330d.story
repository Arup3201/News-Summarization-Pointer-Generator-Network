Today's start-up names make Yahoo! sound sedate and quaintly old-fashioned. And with around 252 million domain names registered across the internet, they're set to get more outlandish.

Wacky spellings, portmanteau words and inexplicable suffixes like 'ify' or 'sy' (think Spotify and Huntsy) abound in the quest to find an unclaimed URL.

In this era, when every business must have an online presence, the quest to obtain a short, memorable dot-com web address is chief.

What's next: Yext is short, catchy and not a real word - therefore a perfect start-up name, while the founder of Shodogg, a screen sharing platform, felt that Showdog lacked personality

Name game: Flickr was so named because its founders couldn't afford to buy Flicker.com from its owner

But that's no mean feat when there are so many million domain names currently registered across the
Internet.

The solution? Inventing words to register your domain name and avoid paying millions for a properly-spelled, concise URL.

As an example, the rights to the URL investing.com sold for about $2.5 million last year, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Start-ups, by their nature, are usually big on ideas but low on funds. One now-established business that faced a financial challenge when finding a name is Tumblr.

The original: Yahoo is now buying blogging platform and fellow oddly-named business Tumblr for $1.1 billion cash, announced CEO Marissa Mayer in May

Growing: Since its launch in New York City, Thrillist has grown into 20 other markets around the U.S.

When Caterina Fake and Stewart 
Butterfield had the idea for a photo-sharing site in 2004, they decided 
to call it Flicker, but the domain name was taken and the owner refused 
to sell it to them. They settled for Flickr and the rest is history.

The
Wall Street Journal reports that Twitter was originally Twttr in 2006 -
the domain name for Twitter.com was taken and the company's co-founder 
Biz Stone didn't think they could afford to buy it.

'We
assumed it would be too expensive,' he told the Wall St Journal. Soon 
enough, though, Twttr took off, and the company was able to 'buy the 
vowels'.

One 
mathematically-minded Australian entrepreneur was trying to come up with
a name for his data-science consulting business and finding the options
slim.

So Anthony Goldbloom,
30, wrote an algorithm to generate all the pronounceable combinations 
of letters, three syllables or fewer, whose dot-com addresses weren't 
already claimed.

'I was too frugal to want to pay for an [existing] domain name,' he told the Wall Street Journal.

He got 700 options out of his algorithm and was tossing up between 
Sumble and Kaggle when a poll of friends and family overwhelmingly voted
for Kaggle.

Goldbloom could
now afford a much more conventional name - Kaggle has been backed by a 
number of Silicon Valley investors, and PayPal co-founder Max Levchin is
its chairman - but with that kind of success, why would he want to?

Portmanteau: Mibblio, a sing-along story book company, is a mixture of 'music' and the Latin word for book 'biblio'

Game changr: Tumblr's misspelling has become part of its cache

The naming of start-ups and products is such big business that companies exist solely for the purpose of finding the perfect name.

Steve Manning, founder and presumably name-designator of Igor, a name-consulting business, says today's start-ups are going the wrong way about choosing their business names.

'The primary driver for start-up naming right now is the misguided mission to find the shortest possible, pronounceable [unclaimed] dot-com address,' Manning told the Wall Street Journal.

He says short URLs aren't the be-all and end-all and that start-ups are underestimating their potential customers if they assume people won't respond to a longer business name and website.

Nancy Friedman, a name and tagline developer, agrees.

'A short name isn’t always the best name,' she writes at her blog Fritinancy.

'Your URL doesn’t have to be your name: The web address of Open, a design agency in Manhattan, is notclosed.com. And alternatives to .com abound - .us, .ca, and the many country-code domains that can be employed in creative ways.'

Bought vowels: The San Francisco offices of Twitter are well-appointed now, but when it first launched as Twttr, the social media company couldn't afford to buy its vowels

Friedman also points out that 'quirky' names aren't a recent phenomenon. You only have to walk down the processed snack-food aisle at the supermarket to see that start-ups don't have a monopoly on crazy names (think Cheez-Its, Poptarts, Lunchables, or Krispy Kreme).

Nevertheless, in the challenge to come up with a short name that conveys meaning, and is easy to pronounce and logical to spell, start-ups are certainly the leading the kooky-name pack.

Mashable's tips for founders naming their start-ups advises the use of prefixes and suffixes, as in bitly, Spotify and Rootsy, creating compound words or portmanteaus, like Facebook, Foursquare and Thrillist. Or, simply misspell a word, as Tumblr, Digg and Reddit all have.

If that all fails? Make something up - think Yipit and Yobongo. Mashable recommends using lots of vowels to add rhythm to the name. Or, just ask Kaggle if you can borrow his algorithm.
