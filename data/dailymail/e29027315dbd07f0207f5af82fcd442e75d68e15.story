My three children - ranging in age from nine to 12, and not hugely experienced on the slopes - are desperate to ski an Olympic run.

That will be a challenge almost as tricky as finding a family ski holiday that doesn't mean financial meltdown.

Miraculously, the tiny Italian resort of Sansicario meets everyone's demands. It was purpose built for Italy's 2006 Winter Games and is part of the Milky Way, one of the world's largest ski areas.

Suitable for junior snow demons: Sansicario has a nice mix of slopes for skiers of all levels

The four-star Hotel Majestic is an hour from Turin, and it's a steal.

It has a children's club, indoor pool, entertainment, afternoon tea, and free wine with dinner.

One morning, my husband and I explore the neighbouring resorts of Sauze D'Oulx and Sestriere (included in the lift pass), which offer great skiing and are easily accessible.

Back in the hotel, our children's mantra continues: 'We want to do the Olympic run.'

The day finally arrives. I lead the troops up a steep drag lift towards the summit. There is only one way to go.

'Is this a black run?' asks nine-year-old Hannah.

'No,' I lie, adding: 'Be careful and go slow.'

They speed off like demons - gold medals all round.

Crystal Ski (0203 468 6854, www.crystalski.co.uk) has a week's half-board at the four-star Hotel Majestic in Sansicario, from £569 per adult and £455 per child - including flights, transfers, afternoon tea and unlimited house wine.
