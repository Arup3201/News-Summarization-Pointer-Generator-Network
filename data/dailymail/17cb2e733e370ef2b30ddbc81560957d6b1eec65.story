She's best friends with Kendall and Kylie Jenner, was rumoured to be dating Justin Bieber and hails from Hollywood royalty, so it was little surprise that Topshop wanted to tap into Hailey Baldwin's magic.

The 18-year-old has been snapped up as the face of the high street chain's SS15 denim range - and proves her worth as a fledgling supermodel in the shoot.

In the fast-paced and fickle world of fashion, designers are always on the hunt for a new muse, and it seems that Hailey could be the next big thing.

Things are looking pretty good for ever rising model Hailey Baldwin; she’s BFF’s with some of the most famous youngsters in the world including Justin Bieber and Kendall Jenner, and she’s just landed herself the Topshop Spring/Summer 2015 campaign. All hail(ey) the new style queen!

The edgy blonde showed us her flair for modelling in the series of gorgeous pictures for the new Topshop line, and we can’t get enough of these mom jeans for our crop tops and sneakers come spring. We’re particularly in awe of these washed out jeans (pictured) by Topshop Boutique, which would look super cool with a black fisherman's jumper, leather belt and black boots.

And the great news? They’re $105 and available to buy online, but hurry up, because they’re selling out fast already. If you can't find your size, head into a Topshop store with a Boutique section or check out the style edit below for some great alternatives, our favorite being these Paige Denim Jimmy Jimmy style at Bloomingdales.

Hailey didn't just spring out of nowhere, she hails from one of the most famous families in Tinseltown.

As the daughter of the youngest Baldwin brother, Stephen, known for his starring roles in an array of Hollywood blockbuster hits such as Barney Rubble in The Flinstones, and niece of Alec, Hailey was always set for a glittering career.

Speaking about her famous family, Hailey, who was homeschooled, told Love magazine: 'The thing that was annoying about having an uncle that’s in 30 Rock is that kids [my age] didn’t understand it. They’re like, "What?" Then they’re like, "You have to go away to LA with your dad, what?" And they didn’t get that. And that’s what I’ve struggled with my whole life in school, too.'

Luckily for her, a life in fashion followed. She walked in the Topshop's SS15 show, a catwalk known for snapping up the coolest young stars, such as Jourdan Dunn, Rosie Tapner, Malaika Firth and Cara Delevingne.

Hailey and model-of-the-moment Kendall Jenner have been friends for years, having both grown up in Los Angeles, and Hailey has often featured  on Keeping Up With The Kardashians

At 17, she was unveiled as the new face of French Connection and starred in an edgy new photoshoot to showcase the label's Work to Weekend range

Clearly someone was paying attention; she landed a major gig with fashion brand French Connection.

The then 17-year-old model and 'it' girl was unveiled as the face of the high street brand and starred in an edgy new photoshoot to showcase the label's Work to Weekend range.

Shoots for high fashion magazines Love and Vogue quickly followed for the fledgling clothes horse, who is represented by Ford Models.

Her famous friendship haven't hurt either. Hailey can count several public figures as her nearesr and dearest, including model-of-the-moment, Kendall Jenner.

The pair have been friends for years, having both grown up in Los Angeles, and Hailey has often featured as an unknown friend of Kendall and Kylie on Keeping Up With The Kardashians. 

She attends all Hollywood events with her best friend, and they can often be seen partying on social media with the likes of Miley Cyrus, Selena Gomez and Gigi Hadid.

Her close friendship with Justin Bieber, pictured together on New Year's Eve, has also made headlines

The star is  loved by fashion insiders for her relaxed sense of style, perfect pout and is a talented ballerina

Her close friendship with Justin Bieber has also made headlines - and boosted her Instagram followers to the million mark. The pair spent New Year's Eve together and were pictured getting close in Justin's swimming pool, which fuelled rumours among his loyal fans. 

However, after much speculation that Hailey and Bieber have grown close, it has been reported by TMZ they they are just friends, and that Justin is not dating either Hailey or Kendal, who he has also been linked to.

The site claimed that Justin, who has gained a reputation as a bit of a troublemaker over the past few years, likes to spend time with the girls 'because they're relatively drama free and positive'.

A source added that together 'they go to church, restaurants, concerts and clubs, but it's not romantic'. 

Either way, the much publicised friendship hasn't hurt her reputation.

The star, who is also loved by fashion insiders for her relaxed sense of style, is a talented ballerina and has previously admitted that she hasn't ruled out a career in dance.

She has also spoken about her desire to branch out into fashion design and has already designed a top for American label, Brandy Melville USA. 

Watch your back, Cara Delevingne.
