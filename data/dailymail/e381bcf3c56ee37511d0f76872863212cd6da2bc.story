Former MP Margaret Moran, one of the last politicians investigated over the scandal, stood down at the 2010 general election

Disgraced former Labour MP Margaret Moran cheated the taxpayer out of £53,000 in one of the worst cases of fraud to emerge from the parliamentary expenses scandal, a jury found yesterday.

But despite the damning verdict, 57-year-old Moran will not be punished after a judge ruled she was too depressed to stand trial.

As a consequence, the former MP for Luton South will not even receive a criminal record although the jury in the rare ‘trial of issue’ ruled that she had committed 21 counts of fraud.

Last night, anti-sleaze campaigners reacted with astonishment to the news that Moran will not be jailed. It is also unclear whether any steps can be taken to reimburse the public purse.

Moran is the fifth MP to face criminal proceedings for abusing parliamentary allowances.

Between April 2004 and August 2008 she submitted fraudulent claims of around £60,000 – more than double that of any of the other four MPs who have been tried – of which she received more than £53,000.

Moran did not have to appear at Southwark Crown Court nor enter a plea to the 15 charges of false accounting and six of using false information after a judge ruled her ‘severe depressive disorder’ meant she was unable to defend herself. The charges included submitting ‘bogus’ invoices for more than £22,000 for goods and services which did not exist.

The jury found that the case against ‘broken woman’ Moran, who earned a £64,766 salary as an MP, was ‘proved’.

Mr Justice Saunders said he cannot ‘punish her as such’ through a prison sentence or fine. Instead, he can give her a hospital order, supervision order or absolute discharge. He adjourned his decision but indicated a supervision order is most likely. Meanwhile, Moran is being treated by psychiatrists at home in Southampton.

Last night former anti-sleaze MP Martin Bell said: ‘I am lost for words. What she did was an appalling abuse of public trust. I am amazed that so far only four MPs have ended up in jail. She should count herself very lucky that she is not the fifth.’

Ms Moran's appearance has changed dramatically since the 2010 election and she was found unfit to stand trial due to mental health issues

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, added: ‘The verdict does not feel like justice done.’

The court heard how Moran, an MP from 
1997 until her resignation in 2010, ‘abused’ the system of claiming 
parliamentary expenses, which was largely based on trust.

Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, said MPs
were permitted to receive expenses for a designated second home, but 
she had twice swapped the designation of her second home ‘in a process 
known as flipping’.

She had exploited the system to ‘kit out’ homes in London, Luton and Southampton.

In 2006 she submitted a claim for 
£4,756.40 for replacement kitchen units for her second home, which was 
accompanied by an invoice from a firm called Elite Builders that was a 
‘complete forgery’. A year later, she submitted invoices for £14,805 and
£1,823 for work in the name of Mandere Construction, but the bills were
‘utterly false’.

In 2008, she ‘flipped’ her designated home to Southampton, which belonged to her then fiancé and now husband Michael Booker.

She submitted false bills for £22,500 
of building work at this property, including dry rot repairs, which was 
for work completed in the previous financial year, when she had already 
exhausted her parliamentary allowance, and when her designated second 
home was in Luton.
