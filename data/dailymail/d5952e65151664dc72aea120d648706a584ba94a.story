A high school student killed himself by jumping off a cliff as his mother and sister helplessly looked on in horror.

Witnesses said John Albrigo, 18, 'flew off the cliff like a bird' after talking to them for hours about his depression and having ignored pleas from his desperate mother Rosemarie.

He plunged 250 feet to his death at Palos Verdes Estates, Los Angeles after thanking a police officer, who responded to a 911 call, for his help and saying he had 'something to do'.

Colleen Ecker, a counselor was by 
chance in the area to counsel two high school students at about 10am 
when she spotted John, she told the Daily Breeze.

She saw the teenager standing at the 
edge of a cliff, wearing shorts and a T-shirt, with his arms 
outstretched and heard him praying and chanting.

'He
had one foot in front of the other and started to lunge. I thought he 
was meditating but the girls felt like he was going to lunge,' Ms Ecker 
said in the report.

She said she called out to him before inviting him to sit with them under a tree and he agreed.

He told them his name was Jesus but later admitted it was John, she told the Breeze, and talked about his struggles with depression and problems with his father.

'He said: "I'm in so much pain that I have to take my life. There's nothing I can live for. At 11:11 I have to take my life,"' Ms Ecker said.

'He was the most charismatic, delightful, energetic, spiritual person. He quoted biblical passages and loved talking to the girls.'

Ms Ecker said John continued to talk with the girls about his spiritual beliefs including a notion that he was the 'chosen one'.

Troubled: John said he was in so much pain and he had nothing to live for before committing suicide

His mother Rosemarie and sister had driven to the cliffs to stop him.

The police said that a neighbour called the police when the mother and son began arguing.

'As soon as the cop pulled up, he said, "Thank you for your help. I have something I have to do," and he started running,' Ms Ecker told the Breeze. 

'He had a happy glow. He went off the edge like a bird and fell flat on the rocks.'

Tributes: A "R.I.P. John Albrigo" Facebook group set up in tribute to the youngster describes John as 'an amazing person' who was always smiling and will be 'missed forever'

Ms Ecker said John took cellphone pictures of himself before jumping.

'It was a very premeditated suicide. I think we delayed it,' she said. 

'He seemed quite determined. I think he suffered from depression. He was lost. He definitely didn't want to live.'

The teenager had driven from him family's West Hills home that morning, Palos Verdes Estates police Sgt. Steve Barber told the Breeze.

His body was airlifted from the shore by a Los Angeles County Fire Department helicopter at about 1pm, reports the Breeze.
