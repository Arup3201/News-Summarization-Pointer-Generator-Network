Leeds United have dropped their interest in Chesterfield defender Liam Cooper after having a second bid rejected by the League One club.

Leeds’ initial bid was thought be in the region of £500,000, while the Spireites were holding out for closer to £1million for the 22-year-old.

‘The Elland Road club tweeted on Wednesday: ‘The club can confirm that it has had a second bid for Chesterfield defender Liam Cooper rejected.

‘The club will not be progressing with this matter further and any interest in the player has now ended.’

Cooper started his career at Hull before joining Chesterfield in January 2013.

He was an instrumental part of Paul Cook’s League Two-winning side last season.

Leeds have also shown interest in Rotherham forward Kieran Agard as new manager Dave Hockaday looks to strengthen his squad ahead of the new Championship season.

Leeds will open talks with free agent Nile Ranger on Thursday.
