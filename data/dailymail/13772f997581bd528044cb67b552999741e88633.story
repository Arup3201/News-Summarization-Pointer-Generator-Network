Craven Cottage has surely never witnessed an eruption anything like that which followed Colombia's winner against the USA.

They had been whipped into a frenzy by the performance of James Rodriguez and dominated the match, but had to wait until late on to steal it.

Teofilo Gutierrez headed in Edwin Cardona's cross in the 87th minute as they came from a goal down and the stadium crammed with Colombia fans exploded.

For the whole match they had reacted insanely to Rodriguez's every movement.

They were undeterred even when America took the lead in the 10th minute through Jozy Altidore's penalty. 

The Sunderland striker took a slow run-up and calmly struck the spot kick down the middle after Colombia's Pablo Armero had handled in the box.

Ahead of kick off a red double-decker London bus was completely taken over by Colombian fans, partying their way down the Fulham Place Road.

Closer to Craven Cottage, Stevenage Road running along the outside of the ground was crammed with yellow, well before the turnstiles were opened.

The mere appearance of Real Madrid's Rodriguez – who was their star and one of the players of the World Cup – and the stadium was akin to a secondary girls school assembly being paid a surprise visit by One Direction.

Even when he did barely anything, the decibel levels rose. At one point in the first half, he crossed the ball from the right-hand side. It wasn't a particularly special cross and Carlos Bacca's header was even less spectacular, sailing well over the bar, but the Colombian crowd reacted as if they had just witnessed the winner in a World Cup final.

Two minutes later he actually produced a moment worthy of cheer, when he sent a free kick from just outside the box on the left fizzing low towards the far right corner with his left-foot and inches wide of the post.

Yet the closest the Colombian's came to scoring before the break did not involve Rodriguez at all. On 33 minutes, Teofilo Gutierrez swiftly broke down the right and passed into Bacca who hit a first-time shot which crashed off the outside of the near right post.

In first-half stoppage time, when Colombia had a shout for a penalty after a shot clearly struck Jermaine Jones' hand, Polish referee Szymon Marciniak gave nothing and the low, collective murmur of discontent from the crowd must've set his spine shuddering.

The Americans had been dominated for the majority of the first half, but they came out in the second and carved out one of the best chances of the match within minutes.

Alejandro Bedoya crossed into the box and Rubin got in front of his man, dove at the ball and headed narrowly wide from close range.

But, to remind the Colombians why they were there – as if they needed reminding – Rodriguez was in action again moments later, sending a free kick curving towards the far top left corner which Brad Guzan had to push over. The supporters worked up into a frenzy. A little later he controlled the ball with his chest and slipped over. There was a similar reaction.

Then the equaliser came, just after the hour mark. And it involved that man, of course. Rodriguez played a delicate through ball into the path of Bacca who had made an angled run into the box, rounded Guzan and scored.

The reaction to that goal was something special – but it was eclipsed when they finally came up with the late winner.
