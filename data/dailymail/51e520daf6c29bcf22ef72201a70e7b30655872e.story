If the Premier League awarded points for apologies, Joey Barton might already have made amends for the latest red card of his controversial career.

As it is, even Barton’s own teammates at Queens Park Rangers are growing tired of their captain’s excuses after they were left to battle fellow strugglers Hull City for an hour with 10 men.

Barton was sent off in the 32nd minute for shoving Hull defender Alex Bruce and then aiming a low blow into the groin of Tom Huddlestone.

Barton's red card was the ninth dismissal he has received over the course of a controversial career 

Charlie Austin's strike means he is the joint top-scoring Englishman in the Premier League this season alongside Harry Kane with 14 goals.

The 32-year-old will now miss the next three games in QPR’s survival fight – London derbies against Arsenal, Tottenham and Crystal Palace – and apologised profusely to his teammates and the club’s supporters after Saturday’s costly defeat at the KC Stadium.

But Charlie Austin, who cancelled out Nikica Jelavic’s opening goal only to see Dame N’Doye head a late winner for Hull, said: ‘There’s only so many times you can say sorry.

‘It’s a silly sending-off and it’s kind of cost us the game. He’s the villain and rightly so for getting sent off. He’s got to deal with it.

‘He’s going to miss the next three games and he’s an important player for us, he’s our captain. We move on now.’

New QPR head coach Chris Ramsey wants to take his players away on a training break this week and will use the opportunity to speak to Barton, whose ninth red card of his career followed a Premier League record seven consecutive yellows. 

PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor called for Barton to undergo anger management in May 2012 after the midfielder was banned for 12 games for lashing out at Manchester City players Carlos Tevez, Sergio Aguero and Vincent Kompany, and Ramsey has not ruled it out as an option now.

‘It’s something I would discuss with the player and see what he’s open to,’ said the QPR boss. ‘The medical staff are very good here so I’m sure a whole range of things have been discussed with him in his career.

‘He’s quite an intelligent lad and I’m sure he would be open to anything that he thought could help him. We’ll have a discussion in the cold light of day away from this incident and see where we go next.’

Barton apologised to his teammates at half-time and to fans on Twitter, but insisted that he was only defending Darnell Furlong after the teenage debutant had angered the Hull players with a late challenge on Jelavic.

‘Senior pros shouldn’t be running over asking for him to be sent off,’ said Barton. ‘If the boot was on the other foot, I wouldn’t be screaming for a 19-year-old kid from Hull to be sent off.

‘Alex Bruce has run 40 yards to not only get in the ref’s face and scream for a red card but he barged me in the process.

‘I’ve stupidly reacted and touched Tom Huddlestone up. Absolutely no malice, I didn’t intend to hurt Tom. But I’ve been a fool and I’ve been rightly punished for it.

‘You see other incidents where people make contact with other people’s faces and it isn’t a red card. Without making excuses for my own actions, it’s stupid but not malicious.

‘I was sitting in there for a couple of hours just thinking how stupid it was. The sickener for me, as someone who puts the team above everything else, is that I’ve let the team down.

‘I’ve apologised to everyone and come out and fronted up. I’ve always been one, when I’ve made mistakes, to hold my hands up and say I’ve made a mistake.

‘It’s a testament to the kind of person that I am that I’ve fronted up. I’ve made a mistake, I’m human. I’ll try my utmost to atone for it in whatever way that is. All I can say is I’m sorry I’ve let people down, certainly our fans and the players.

‘I’m a man of substance and a man of principle. I can only apologise to the lads, I can’t chop my arm off and give it to them. Obviously, if I could rewind it and take it back, I wouldn’t do it.

‘There are no excuses. As a 32-year-old with a few hundred Premier League appearances, and someone who’s been captain of the club for a while with a very public profile, I should know a lot better.

‘People will lambast me from pillar to post and I have to accept that. As one of the tallest trees, you catch the most wind. I won’t shy away from it.

‘There’s a long way to go between now and the end of the season and I hope to atone for it because that’s all I can really do.’
