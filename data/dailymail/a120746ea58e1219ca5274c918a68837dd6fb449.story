She's one of showbiz's most famous redheads so it's hardly surprising that actress Christina Hendricks has been snapped up to front a new hair colour campaign.

The Mad Men star has been unveiled as the face - and glossy raven tresses - of Nice 'N Easy, promoting the brand's Shift A Shade campaign, which aims to inspire women to  find their true colour.

Speaking about her new role, the 39-year-old from Tennessee said: 'I’m so excited. It’s a product I’ve been using ever since I went red. I love that the results are so natural looking; I know it’s going to turn out natural and beautiful and I don’t have to worry about it.'

She continued: 'People never believe that I do my hair colour myself at home. They say, "You don’t do your hair at home by yourself, do you?" and I always reply and say "I honestly do!".'

Naturally a dark blonde, as a young girl Christina was first inspired to colour her hair red by the fictional heroine of LM Montgomery’s books, Anne Of Green Gables, another of the world’s most iconic red heads.

Finally making the leap early in her career, Christina coloured her hair for an Italian magazine shoot and it’s been her colour of choice ever since; through the beginnings of her acting and modelling career, to all seven seasons of Mad Men. 

Speaking to MailOnline about making the plunge from blonde to red all those years ago, Christina said: 'The first time I did a photo shoot with Clairol Nice 'N Easy was when I was about 19 or 20 years old, I was a model and I was blonde at the time.

'[They] took me red and I was absolutely thrilled, I loved it so much I still actually have the picture from that shoot. I went back to my agency and said I’m staying red this is it, I love it, and they let me.'

The star, who was once hailed the sexiest woman in the world by Esquire magazine, revealed that her red hair has influenced her style.

She said: 'I think being a red head has encouraged me to be a bit more playful with my fashion, maybe be little bit more quirky and eccentric even, so when I go out in the evening I like to play with colour and jewellery and it sort of compliments being a red head.'

Mad Men will soon come to an end after seven seasons, but Christina  has already started to move on from the period drama.

The  actress behind Joan Harris (nee Holloway) has been cast on Cameron Crowe's upcoming comedy, Roadies.

Cable network Showtime made the casting announcement in December.

Hendricks will play Shelli, the tough-but-emotional production manager of a touring rock band and her character is described as being 'married to her job.'

Hendricks' co-stars in the one-hour comedy include Luke Wilson, as a newly sober tour manager, and Imogen Poots as an electrical technician.

A busy actress for several years before Mad Men, Hendricks appeared in recurring roles for shows like ER, Firefly, and Life.

But it was her casting as head secretary Joan Holloway on Mad Men that brought Hendricks wider fame.

Betty Draper (January Jones), Peggy Olson (Elisabeth Moss) and Joan Harris (Christina Hendricks) made names for themselves in Mad Men

Her character dealt with the business world of the 1960s, facing everything from casual sexism and rape to single motherhood.

For her work, Hendricks received five Emmy nominations for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama.

Fans will not have to wait for the premiere of Roadies to see Hendricks again, since the final episodes of Mad Men will air during 2015.

Hendricks will also co-star with Chloe Grace Moretz, Nicholas Hoult, and Charlize Theron in the 2015 film, Dark Places.
