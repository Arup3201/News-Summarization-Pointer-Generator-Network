Shane Warne's days as a superstar on the pitch may have come to an end, but the former leg-spinner is still finding a way to be a hero off it.

The Australian cricket legend dressed as Superman for New Year's Eve as he went out with a posse of friends dress as comic-book stars.

Warne was joined by model and photographer Rosanna Faraci, who came as Catwoman, and glamour model Kirsty Lee, dressed as Wonder Woman.

The 45-year-old, who took 708 Test Match wickets during a stellar career, posted pictures to Instagram as he prepared to bring in the new year.

'Kaos tonight !!!!' he wrote. 'Lucky I have Cat woman @rosannafaraci & Wonder Woman @kirsty_lee_kl keeping me safe !!!! Happy new year.'

A second picture showed a bigger group, featuring several friends dressed as Catwoman, one as Spiderman and one as IronMan.
