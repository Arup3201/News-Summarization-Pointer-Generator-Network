Six months into his time at Manchester United and Louis van Gaal already believes he has reason to be grateful.

Heading in to the second half of the Barclays Premier League season, the Dutchman sees his team on the shoulder of title favourites Chelsea and Manchester City. If United don’t quite look like title contenders, they do resemble a team heading in the right direction.

It wasn’t always like this for Van Gaal and his team, though. Having taken only 13 points from their first 10 league games, United were struggling at the start of November and their manager thanked the club’s supporters for showing patience he feels he wouldn’t have received at his previous clubs.

Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has thanks the fans for their unwavering support 

The supporters have always backed their new manager despite a rocky start to the season

Asked if anything had surprised him about his time at United, Van Gaal said: ‘The fans. I have never had the experience that when you lose or draw at home that the fans are still applauding for you, showing their belief in you. Never.

‘In Barcelona, the white handkerchiefs would have come out. In Bayern Munich, they would have been whistling. In Amsterdam, Ajax, they would have been shouting for my “friend” Cruyff (to replace me).

‘Here, they are applauding — they stand up and applaud. Unbelievable. That’s why I’m thanking the fans because they were very important in my first six months.

‘Early on, it was more weak than good. In spite of that, the fans have supported us always and in the right way. They always had belief in the players and their manager, and I think the main reason they have supported us is because of the fighting spirit of my team.

‘We were not always ahead in matches, but they have fought to the end and a lot of times with good success, so I think we can be satisfied about the points now — 36 points.’

Wayne Rooney has flourished in a number of roles under the Dutchman since his arrival 

As he looked ahead to a New Year that will see injured players returning, Van Gaal has not ruled out a dip at the title. For that to happen, Chelsea and City would have to show uncharacteristic weakness but Van Gaal is perhaps too experienced to rule anything out.

In fact, he pointed out ahead of today’s game at Stoke City that his first title in the German Bundesliga with Bayern came from a similar position.

‘Maybe you can see the Bayern results of my first year,’ he said. ‘I think that I have more points now with Manchester United than with Bayern Munich at the same time that year. But at the end of the season, we were champions.

‘But you cannot compare the German league with the English league. It’s apples with pears — that’s a Dutch expression.

‘It all depends on Chelsea and Manchester City. They are the only teams who are above and you have seen Manchester City — in spite of a 2-0 result at half-time on Sunday, it was 2-2 at the end. You have to compare always with this kind of club.

Robin van Persie (battling with Hugo Lloris) has found himself in among the goals again 

United are also beginning to see the best of Colombian striker Radamel Falcao 

‘But in our last three games — Aston Villa, Newcastle, Tottenham — that should be nine points in my opinion. Then, we have four points more and then only six points behind.

‘It’s not always that the best team is winning and that’s also nice in football I think. You never can predict.

‘I could not predict that Manchester City, at home, allows Burnley — last, or one of the last on the table — to come back. I could not imagine. But when I read it, it was true.’

United are unbeaten now in nine matches, a run that has moved them up the table. A 2-1 home win against Stoke formed part of that run, with United hanging on at the end of that game under pressure from Mark Hughes’ team.

Van Gaal moved to praise referee Michael Oliver, who will take charge of the game at Stoke 

Stoke are in somewhat less consistent form at the moment, but Van Gaal knows they will be highly motivated for a game that is likely to test United’s physical durability in more ways than one.

‘I hope that my players are recovered,’ Van Gaal said. ‘We have now one and a half days more than between the matches against Newcastle and Tottenham Hotspur, so I don’t think that plays a role.

‘But I think the referee is the most important man on the pitch always in relation to tackles. He has to allow it or not.

‘We have Michael Oliver, I believe, and I think he is a very good referee.’
