A protection officer guarding Prince George and his mother as they flew out to Mustique for the baby's first foreign holiday left a confidential file behind when they got off the plane.

Two Metropolitan Police officers accompanied the Duchess of Cambridge and some of her family - minus Prince William, who stayed behind to study in Cambridge - on a scheduled British Airways flight from Gatwick to St Lucia last month.

When they got off to board a private jet for the island of Mustique, where the Middleton family have rented a £5million villa, one of the officers left the dossier behind.

A royal protection officer accompanying Kate and Prince George, pictured on their way to Mustique, left secret documents on the BA jet they took from Gatwick to St Lucia, it emerged today

BA cabin crew handed it to management who made sure it was returned to the Royal Protection Officer.

A Scotland Yard spokesman told MailOnline this morning: 'On 25 January a Metropolitan Police Service officer left some documents on a plane.

'The documents were returned to the officer by airline staff.

'The papers didn't contain any classified documents and the circumstances of the loss are currently being looked into.'

Six-month-old George travelled to the Caribbean with his mother, uncle James Middleton, and royal bodyguards on a 747 jumbo jet, and was said to have behaved impeccably during the 8,500-mile 
flight.

Pictured on arrival at St Lucia, the baby was dressed in a summery blue and white romper suit with matching sun-hat.

The party, including Kate’s parents, Michael and Carole, sister Pippa and brother James, stayed at a four-bedroom villa staffed by a 
butler, chef, housekeeper and gardener, with an outdoor dining area 
overlooking the sea, as well as a lush tropical garden.

Mustique has become a favourite destination for the Middleton family who were celebrating Carole's birthday

Smartly decorated in crisp whites and tasteful tropical prints, the villa was filled with flowers, candles and every electronic device for the convenience of the royal mother and son.

Designer built in the 1970s and refurbished a few years ago,  it has four bathrooms, upper and lower decks and a gazebo for extra hot days.

It is believed the Duchess' parents and sister, Pippa, were already waiting on Mustique at the villa which normally rents for £8,500 a week.

The holiday was in part organised to celebrate Mrs Middleton’s 59th birthday last week, but the future king remained behind in England where he is halfway through a 10-week agricultural course being taught at Cambridge University.

Mustique has become a favourite holiday destination of the millionaire Middleton family, who made their fortune selling party good on the internet.

It boasts one small hotel and just 74 villas - one of which once belonged to the Queen’s sister, Princess Margaret, a gift from her former suitor, Colin Tennant, who bought the entire island in the mid-20th century for just £45,000.
