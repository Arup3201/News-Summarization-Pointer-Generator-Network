A father-to-be has spoken of his desperate desire to meet his unborn daughter before he dies from cancer.

Jared Noel is battling advanced bowel cancer that has spread to his liver and his lungs.

The 32-year-old doctor, from Auckland, New Zealand, was diagnosed with the disease in 2008.

Jared Noel (with wife, Hannah) is battling advanced bowel cancer that has spread to his liver and his lungs. The 32-year-old doctor, from New Zealand, was diagnosed with the disease in 2008. He is now desperately hoping to live long enough to meet his unborn daughter, due in January

Since then, he has undergone a gruelling 66 rounds of chemotherapy and major surgery twice, the New Zealand Herald reported. 

Even though his prognosis was bleak, Dr Noel and his wife Hannah decided to try for a baby - hoping he would live long enough to meet the child and spend some time with him or her.

After four rounds of IVF, they succeeded, and their daughter is due on January 21.

But they have now been given the devasting news that Dr Noel's cancer has spread - and he has just months to live. 

Thanks to a huge online fundraising effort in New Zealand, he has managed to raise the $60,000 NZD (£30,700) to pay for ten courses of medicine to prolong his life - enough, he hopes, to meet his daughter.

In a heartbreaking post on his blog, he wrote: 'More recently, the joys of Hannah’s pregnancy has dominated our life.

'Setting
 up the baby room, feeling the kicks of our daughter, and choosing her 
name has been such a great experience, one that has become even more 
amazing when juxtaposed against our circumstance and the finite lifespan
 I have….

'I had a CT scan 
on Monday, and the results from that have devastated us. I have rampant,
 multiple new metastatic disease all throughout my liver, almost too 
much to count.

I have new disease in my mesentery and a new nodule in the right apex of my lung.

'This is the moment we have been dreading for 5 years and have been lucky to escape until now.

'This is where everything changes. I have a lifespan measured in months.

'Hannah
 and I are gutted, the realisation that cancer is winning is like having
 a knife hacked into the deepest part of our soul.

'The
 disappointment is compounded by knowing we have a daughter waiting to 
meet us, and for the first time, doubt has been cast over whether or not
 I will make that meeting.

'This is aggressive cancer, doing its best to kill me, to rob our child of their father. We are devastated.'

He added: 'My greatest hope is that I get to spend some time with her and enjoy fatherhood. She won't know me. She won't remember me. But I'd like to let her know how much I would have wanted to be there when she's 18, when she's 25.'

Dr and Mrs Noel did not have the funds to pay for a life-prolonging drug, called Avastin. This slows the growth of tumours - hopefully prolonging his life long enough to meet his unborn daughter. 

The
 drug is not paid for by the New Zealand agency which decides which 
medicines and products are subsidised for use in the community and 
public hospitals.

Desperate for him to meet his daughter, the couple tried to raise $60,000 NZD (£30,700) to pay for ten courses of the medicine.

Desperate for him to meet his daughter, they tried to raise $60,000 NZD (£30,700) to pay for ten courses of the medicine. Thanks to an overwhelming response from well-wishers, they have now raised $154, 500 (around £80,000)

Dr Noel said: 'If it wasn't for her [the baby], we would do our best and let nature take its course.

'But all of a sudden months and weeks are the difference between meeting my daughter or not and maybe the difference between me having a few months with her or not.

'It means a lot to Hannah, as she'll get to see me holding her. I'm doing it mainly for Hannah and my daughter now.'

The fundraising response in the couple's home country has been staggering. Within seven hours of setting up a page on the site Givealittle, they had raised the $60,000.

Avastin (also known as Bevacizumab) targets a protein that helps cancer cells develop a new blood supply.

It blocks the protein and stops the cancer from developing new blood vessels.

This reduces its supply of oxygen and nutrients so the tumour shrinks or stops growing.

The drug is licensed to treat some types of cancer that have spread from where they first started (advanced or metastatic cancers).

It may be used to treat an advanced type of lung cancer or advanced cancers of the bowel, breast or kidney.

As of this morning, the page had raised $154, 500 (around £80,000), with many of the donations from anonymous donors.

The site said it was the fastest fundraising response it had ever seen.

Dr Noel will now begin the Avastin treatment and chemotherapy next week. He said the extra money raised would go towards giving his wife financial security and perhaps to a trust fund after he is gone.

Writing on the fundraising page to express her gratitude, Mrs Noel said: 'The past 48 hours have  been a whirlwind of love, grace and generosity, demonstrating the enormous power of a story, relationships and social media to rally around a cause.

'Jared and I have been given more than we could ever have asked or imagined toward the cost of his treatment and the care of our baby. Our target long exceeded, we just want to thank everyone so very much for their kindness.

'To all those who gave, appealed and reposted on our behalf, often with words that brought tears to our eyes... Our hope is that we will have just a little while longer together and with our baby as a result of your generosity.

'Love your partner, hug your kids, spend time with your families, laugh and cry with your friends - for none of us know how long we have.'
