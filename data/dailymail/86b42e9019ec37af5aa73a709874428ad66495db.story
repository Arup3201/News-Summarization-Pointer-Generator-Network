Mastermind: Virgin Atlantic pilot Mark Entwistle was jailed for 14 years for orchestrating a £30m scam

A Virgin Atlantic pilot who blew 'prodigious sums' in Las Vegas casinos while masterminding a £30million mortgage fraud has been jailed for 14 years.

Innocent families had to leave their homes in and around Windsor, Berkshire, after they were unwittingly caught up in the scam by 47-year-old Mark Entwistle.

He and three accomplices tricked top lenders including RBS into issuing mortgages on other people's houses.

In one case they managed to take out five mortgages on a single property.

But instead of investing in homes, Entwistle  funded a high-rolling lifestyle which included a platinum membership at Vegas casinos Bellagio’s and Caesar’s Palace

Entwistle, an established property developer living in Windsor, also frittered away the cash on a luxury boat and paid off other debts - 'robbing Peter to pay Paul' - as the housing crisis tightened in 2009.

He even blew vast sums on the gambling website Betfair, Southwark Crown Court heard.

Entwistle recruited Jonathan Gilbert, 45, to act as his solicitor and mortgage brokers Nicholas Pomroy, 58, and Matthew Robinson, 40, to process the sophisticated frauds.

The four men were jailed for 34 years between them after a six-month trial as Judge Martin Beddoe branded Entwistle ‘arrogant and greedy, brazen to the last with no expression of remorse'.

The judge told him: ‘This trial has been nothing but another gamble for you but the odds have proved to be too long this time. 

‘Between 2005 and 2009 a substantial and sophisticated fraud was committed against banks and other lenders, some 14 of them or so.

‘The fraud was for the benefit of you, Mark Entwistle, orchestrated by you and Jonathan Gilbert and assisted in some ways by Mr Robinson and Mr Pomroy. 

‘Only a small amount was ever used for the purposes of the loan, and it was often a case of “robbing Peter to pay Paul”.

‘A great deal of money was blown on your excesses Mr Entwistle, to keep up the vague pretence to your friends and others of what a rich and successful man you were.'

He added: 'This was very well orchestrated, professional offending over a long period of time, using and abusing the identities of others.

'This is a story of arrogance and greed. 

‘You may be a good pilot and had a great vision for the development of properties in and around Windsor but none of that exceeds your arrogance or greed.

‘You thought you were better than anyone else and you were unable to get over the need to show off your entrapments of wealth.

‘When it was all falling apart you could so easily joke with Mr Gilbert - you were cynical to the last.

‘You were dishonest and had no compunction but to lie and defraud. Ever since the enquiry in mid-2009 by lenders and the enquiry of Thames Valley Police in 2010, you have continued in the same vein and lied’.

Spree: Entwistle had a platinum membership at the Las Vegas casino Caesar's Palace, the court heard

The court heard Entwistle and Gilbert fleeced RBS and Northern Rock out of more than £6million, using variations on the name Rigby Group to secure illegal mortgages between 2005 and 2009.

At first the money was genuinely used to redevelop property and sell it on at a profit, said prosecutor Michael Shorrock QC. 

‘As time went by, however, he began to raise finance by fraud,' said Mr Shorrock. ‘The loan applications would state that loan funds were to be used to refinance or purchase or develop a particular property.'  

When mortgages were approved, Gilbert did not tell the Land Registry about other mortgages on the property, tricking lenders into thinking they had more legal rights and collateral than they did. 

One house in Ascot, Berkshire, was remortgaged five times for more than £3million pounds and has since been demolished.

In other cases the gang took out mortgages on properties already owned by unconnected people, who had no idea of the loan until the lender told them payments had been missed.

One family had to move out of their £1.5million home for three years after building society bosses arrived to repossess it.

The alarm was finally raised in July 2009 when Wilmett Solicitors in Maidenhead, Berkshire, where Gilbert was a partner,  was wound up due to the debts with the loss of 70 jobs.

Gilbert was banned from practising as a solicitor in the same year, but his fellow partners faced financial ruin when they were saddled with the liability.

During the police investigation, it emerged paperwork held by Gilbert at the solicitors’ firm had been destroyed.

But investigators established Entwistle had netted just over £30million over four years, with the loss to today’s money lenders calculated at £17,798,939. 

He had paid Gilbert by giving him an American Express card which he used to buy holidays to New York, Sardinia and New Zealand.

Entwistle also paid the rent on Gilbert’s home in Windsor, Berkshire, allowing him to live there for free.

Con: Broker Nicholas Pomroy, 58, who 'deliberately told lies and made up figures', was jailed for three years

The ringleader was sentenced in July, but the fraud can only be reported now after a court order was amended. 

He was jailed for 14 years after being convicted of 21 counts of conspiracy to defraud and one count of conspiracy to launder criminal property.

He was acquitted on one count of conspiracy to commit corruption.

Entwistle's right-hand man Gilbert, of Penarth, South Glamorgan, pleaded guilty to 18 counts of conspiracy to defraud and was jailed for 12 years.

The judge said his crimes were 'as bad a breach of trust as it could get'.

'Inherently dishonest' Robinson, of Richmond, Surrey, was jailed for five years after being found guilty of four counts of conspiracy to defraud and one of conspiracy to launder criminal property.

And Pomroy, of Baughurst, Hampshire - who 'deliberately told lies and made up figures that were untrue' - was convicted of two counts of conspiracy to defraud and jailed for three years.

Two other defendants - Philip Barker, 47, of Harrogate, North Yorkshire, and Shon Williams, 48, of  East Grinstead, West Sussex - were cleared of all counts after the trial.

Both were acquitted by the jury of involvement in any conspiracy to defraud or commit corruption. 

Detective Chief Inspector Mick Saunders, of Thames Valley Police, said today: 'Fraud is not a victimless crime.

'Testimony was heard in court about the stress suffered by some whose homes seem to have been sold from underneath them, those who lost life savings and investments and those who lost jobs due to the callous and predatory actions of Entwistle and those who worked with him.

'This organised gang defrauded millions of pounds and I am pleased with the prison terms handed down to them.

'I hope their time behind bars will give them the opportunity to reflect on the pain and misery their actions have caused.

'We continue to investigate their financial affairs to bring Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings against them to ensure they do not benefit from their crime.' 

Treat: Gilbert was handed an American Express card which he used to travel to New York as payment

One couple first learned of the fraud when bailiffs arrived on their doorstep in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, telling them their £1.5million home would be repossessed.

The husband and wife had to take their 12-year-old son out of school and move in with their in-laws for three years when the house became caught up in legal wrangling.

The knock on the door came in mid-2007 from a Birmingham Midshires Building Society representative.

'He said he was here about a repossession,' said the wife, who asked to remain anonymous.

'They came because the mortgage had not been paid by Rigsby... He said the owners were Rigsby. I said "What are you talking about? We are the owners".

'I didn’t know what was going on. I thought we were going to be evicted from our house.'

Once the problem was reported, fraud teams quickly began investigating the case, but that did not prevent the family’s problems mounting.

They were unable to sell their home as they had already planned, because it was caught up in the case. Instead they had to rent it out to try to save money.

That meant moving nearly 80 miles away to stay with in-laws in Littlehampton, West Sussex.  

'It has caused us five years of turmoil,' she added. 'It was a big relief at the end because it was a lot of stress.'

Her husband, a semi-retired IT manager, said of Entwistle: 'I don’t think he actually thinks he’s done anything wrong. It really impacted on our lives.'
