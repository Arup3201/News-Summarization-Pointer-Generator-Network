Anders Konradsen's late goal saw Russia held to a 1-1 draw by Norway in its penultimate World Cup warm-up game in Oslo on Saturday.

Konradsen's 77th-minute header from Morten Gamst Pedersen's cross cancelled out Oleg Shatov's opener for Russia in the third minute.

Frustrated: Fabio Capello's Russia were held to a 1-1 draw by Norway in their penultimate World Cup warm-up game

Quick start: Oleg Shatov put Russia ahead in the third minute but they couldn't hold on to the lead

Russia could have scored more if not for Norway defender Vegard Forren, who twice cleared off the line with goalkeeper Rune Jarstein beaten.

The draw continued the low-key World Cup preparation by Fabio Capello's Russia team.

They beat Slovakia 1-0 in a friendly on Monday and take on Morocco in Moscow on Thursday in their final match before departing for Brazil.

Playing at the World Cup for the first time in 12 years, Russia will take on South Korea, Belgium and Algeria in Group H.

Fightback: Anders Konradsen equalised for Norway late on to deny Russia a morale-boosting win

Second chance: Former England manager Capello will face South Korea, Belgium and Algeria in Brazil
