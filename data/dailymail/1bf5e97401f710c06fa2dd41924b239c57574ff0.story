Luis Enrique has cast some doubt over the fate of Dani Alves by refusing to be drawn on whether his future lies at the club.

When questioned on whether Alves still had a role to play at the Nou Camp, the Barcelona boss answered with the words 'for now'.

The right-back has been an integral part of Barcelona's squad for six seasons, but with Enrique currently undertaking an overhaul of the playing staff, there have been reports that Alves could be on the move. And Paris Saint-Germain are rumoured to be interested in a move for the 31-year-old. 

Still a Catalan: Dani Alves has a future at Barcelona 'for now', says Luis Enrique

Preparation: The new boss is currently readying his squad for his debut campaign in charge

'Alves is a Barcelona player and a very good one,' Luis Enrique told a press conference.

'I know him well and for now he is with Barcelona. I am delighted with his presence in the team.'

Since he was signed from Sevilla in 2008, Alves has made 297 appearances for the Catalans in all competitions, winning four league titles and two Champions Leagues.
