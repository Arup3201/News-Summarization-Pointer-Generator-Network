West Brom are waiting for Australia left-back Jason Davidson and his former Dutch club Heracles Almelo to sort out a contract wrangle before they continue their pursuit of the 23-year-old.

It had been thought that Davidson was available on a free after his contract with the Eredivise club expired.

Dispute: Davidson (right) is in an argument with his club about his contract

Socceroo: The defender looks likely to join West Brom but the club are waiting for him to settle his issue

But Heracles believe that the Australian international is still their player, which would require West Brom to pay a transfer fee.

The full-back started every game for the Socceroos during the World Cup in Brazil, and made 30 appearances in the Dutch top flight last season.
