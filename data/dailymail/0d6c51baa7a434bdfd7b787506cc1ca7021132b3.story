Rolf Harris was yesterday accused of ‘deliberately lying’ during his trial after being confronted with dramatic new TV evidence.

He
 is accused of molesting a teenager while filming a celebrity It’s a 
Knockout-type show in Cambridge in 1975 – but claims he did not visit the university city until 'a couple of years ago, for an art exhibition of my paintings'.

However,
 jurors at Southwark Crown Court were yesterday shown footage of Harris 
taking part in a Thames TV  show called Star Games filmed at Jesus Green in Cambridge in 1978.

The jury were shown this photograph of Rolf Harris taking part in the ITV programme, Star Games filmed in 1978 in Cambridge

Prosecutor Sasha Wass QC put to Harris that the event was the one that the alleged victim had described.

She said: ‘That video supports pretty much everything that (the alleged victim) said apart from the year, she has got the year wrong?’

He replied: ‘By three years, yes, she is out by three years.’

Miss Wass said: ‘But when you told the jury with such confidence last week on Tuesday that you had never been to Cambridge until four years ago, that was a deliberate lie, wasn't it?’

He replied: ‘No, it wasn't. I didn't find out that it was in Cambridge until I saw the video played back and then at the very opening the voiceover introduced it over what I remember was a helicopter shot of the field.

‘That was the first time I had heard the word Cambridge.’

The veteran told jurors: ‘I had no idea. I don't think any of us knew.’

Miss Wass asked: ‘Nobody knew they were in Cambridge?’

Harris replied: ‘None of the performers, none of the stars knew.’

He told the court the performers had probably gone in a bus or coach to the green and he would not necessarily have known where he was.

Footage shown to the jury  in court yesterday showed Rolf Harris taking part in the celebrity show Star Games on ITV in 1978

During
 the opening credits of the Star Games final, a voiceover said the show 
was coming from ‘Cambridge, a tranquil seat of learning.’

Harris
 was announced by host Michael Aspel as captain of one of the celebrity 
teams, which also included actors Colin Baker, Rula Lenska, Julian 
Holloway and Robin Asquith.

The Australian could be seen ‘jumping up and down like a kangaroo and mucking about amusingly’, Miss Wass said.

She told Harris: ‘Michael Aspel seemed to know where he was because he introduced it as being on Jesus Green, Cambridge.’

Harris told Miss Wass she ‘didn’t understand the showbiz scene’, saying he was
 often driven from place to place without knowing the location. The 
alleged victim had suggested the event had taken place in the centre of 
Cambridge in about 1975 when she would have been 14.

She
 said she was working part-time to earn pocket money and was clearing up
 when she saw  Harris entertaining crowds while pretending to be a dog.

But she ‘froze’ as he got to his feet and allegedly ran his hands up and down her as he hugged her.

Miss
 Wass told Harris, who denies the assault: ‘The footage shows you 
monkeying around pretending to be an animal – all of which fits the 
description [the alleged victim] said she saw prior to being assaulted 
by you.

Miss Wass asked: ‘Are you saying that you entirely forgot that event?’

He said: ‘I did until I saw the video and then I remembered it all.’

Pressed further by the prosecutor, the entertainer said: ‘I'm doing hundreds of events during the year, going to Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa.

‘This was 36 years ago you're talking about, 1978, not '75 as you stated earlier.

'I had forgotten that event until I saw that video’

He said he had not deliberately lied, but it was a ‘lapse of memory’.

Putting it to Harris that he had suggested that the alleged victim lied, Miss Wass said: You
 have said categorically in this case that all the people who say they 
had been sexually assaulted by you have lied.

'I'm going to suggest that you are the one that has lied and that video demonstrates it, and that there is no way you could have forgotten that event and you deliberately tried to mislead the jury when you told them that you had not been to Cambridge until four years ago. That was a deliberate lie.

‘The film footage ... demonstrated it’s not the victims who have lied, it’s you who lied.’

Harris denies all the charges against him.

The trial continues.
