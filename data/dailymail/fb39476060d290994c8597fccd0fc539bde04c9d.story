A deranged nanny hated her bosses so much she replaced a bedside water bottle with toilet effluent and dipped their toothbrushes in the loo, she has confided to a US advice columnist.

The former live-in nanny revealed the dirty secret and said after suffering in the role for three months, she got her bosses, a married couple, back for being "annoying and inconsiderate".

'I occasionally took revenge by sneaking into their bathroom and dipping their toothbrushes in the toilet,' she said.

Wrong: The nanny's revenge could result in serious medical implications

According to Washingtonpost.com, the woman said before quitting for the sake of her mental health, she invented other deranged ways of getting revenge.

'The wife kept a drink bottle by the bedside table and I also put some toilet water into it as well,' she said. 'It made me feel better about my crappy situation at the time but now that I've quit (and regained some of my sanity), I'm consumed with guilt.'

The woman said there may have been some serious consequences as a result of the action she took.

'I heard from a mutual acquaintance that both of them are having some kind of health problem - exactly what, I don't knowâ€”and I'm worried I may have caused this,' she said.

She finished by asking for some advice. 'Should I call and confess? We didn't exactly leave on good terms.'

The response from 'Prudence' was amusing but possibly not as reassuring as hoped. 'This is indeed a crappy situation all around. I'm actually surprised you quit because given your response to what you say was intolerable treatment by your employers, you attempted to cause them grave bodily harm - you all sound perfectly matched!' she said.

Think twice: The advice columnist said the drastic revenge was stomach-turning

'Making people ingest fecal matter without their knowledge is indeed likely to make people ill and leave their doctor baffled.'

But despite confessing all, the disgruntled employee was advised not to own up to the horrid act as she could face drastic consequences.

'Part of me would love to tell you to rush to confess. However, I will extend you a courtesy that you didn't give your "inconsiderate" and "rude" employers,' she said.

She said legal advice should be sought in the wake of the stomach-turning revenge.

'While I think this couple should know the source of their illness, confessing could leave you open to potential prosecution. You may deserve it, but you need to consider the stakes here.'

'So my suggestion is that you pay for a consultation with a lawyer and explain the situation. You also should find out what are the potential medical consequences of drinking toilet water. It may be that the need to get a proper diagnosis for this pair is crucial to their treatment, and you must consider that and bring it to the attention of your lawyer.'

Prudence finished off by offering one last piece of advice.

'While your behavior makes my stomach turn, I am slightly heartened that you seem to recognise what you did was an abomination. I hope in the future you recognise that if you're in a poisonous situation, you simply get out without trying to poison anyone else,' she said.
