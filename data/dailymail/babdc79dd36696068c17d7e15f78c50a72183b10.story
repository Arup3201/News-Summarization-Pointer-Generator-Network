In today’s era, we worry about our digital and environmental footprints, but what of the genetic traces we leave behind?

One Brooklyn-based artist has pondered such information, and rendered 3D models of anonymous New Yorker’s faces by using only their DNA collected from everyday discarded items such as gum, cigarette butts, and fallen strands of hair.

Information artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg said that these renderings bear only a ‘family resemblance’ to their original owners, as it would be near-impossible to exactly replicate someone’s looks.

Here's looking at you, kid: Information artists Heather Dewey-Hagborg collected objects from the streets of Brooklyn and created generalized 3D portraits using only their DNA; this cigarette was retrieved from the intersection of Myrtle Ave. and Himrod St. Brooklyn; its smoker is an Eastern European female

In her project, entitled ‘Stranger Visions,’ Ms Dewey-Hagborg was initially intrigued by what information people leave behind.

The original idea came to her during a therapy session. 'I noticed there was a crack in the picture and there was a hair in the crack. I became really curious about it,' she told MailOnline on Sunday evening. 'And seeped in the popular culture of forensics, I really wondered what was actually possible.'

From a single strand of hair, she can extract basic hereditary traits, including hair color, eye color, ethnicity, and gender. However, her 3D renderings were based only on eye color, gender, and maternal ethnicity.

'Age isn’t one of the factors I’m using,' the 30-year-old Bushwick resident said. 'It is information that is becoming increasingly available. Right now, (the renderings) are in the 20-something range. But they could be eight or 80.'

She analyzed the samples and rendered them in a program she wrote herself, and printed out the end result using a 3D printer.

The artist told Co.Exist that a lot of the actual rendering had a lot of guesswork to it.

Dominant genes, such as brown hair and brown eyes, are hard to predict. ‘There’s an 80 percent chance that this person has brown eyes and 20 percent chance they have green eyes,’ she told the website.

Traces: Another subject left a cigarette behind on Myrtle Ave.; the artist discovered that he, too, was of Eastern European descent and had brown hair and eyes

Found objects: The cigarette was recovered from a fairly dingy area of Myrtle Ave. in Brooklyn

‘You have to make that call.’

Ms Dewey-Hagborg added that the rendering called for a bit of, well, artistic licence.

‘It does involve, essentially, creating a stereotype and generating faces based on those stereotyped ideas,’ she told Co.Exist, adding that she’s hoping to tackle additional traits.

She writes on her blog that many of the samples were taken from unassuming locations.

'Like any kind of science, as the 
technology becomes implemented, there is the potential for great help 
and the potential for great harm.'

A cigarette butt from Myrtle Avenue in Brooklyn carried the DNA of an Eastern European male, who was found to have brown eyes.

At the intersection of Wilson Ave. and Stanhope St., Ms Dewey-Hagborg found a discarded piece of used gum. 

The DNA was Haplogroup D1, meaning the chewer was of Native American and South American backgrounds.

'My original goal in starting this project was to understand more about forensic and DNA technology,' she told MailOnline. 'I’m thinking about the issues more, and I hope it can open up a dialogue both in terms of how it can be used in law enforcement and the opportunities we have to survey each other. We don’t have a lot of legislation, and we need a dialogue on it.

'Like any kind of science, as the technology becomes implemented, there is the potential for great help and the potential for great harm.'

Ms Dewey-Hagborg's renderings are currently on display at the Clocktower Gallery in Lower Manhattan.
