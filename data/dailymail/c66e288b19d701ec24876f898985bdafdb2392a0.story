It was the style made famous by Grace Kelly - a far cry from the glowing fake tans and bright nails displayed by those girls from The Only Way Is Essex.

Women prefer to appear classic, elegant and demure - wearing a pencil skirt, fitted T-shirt, matching underwear and three-inch heels, a poll has found.

The perfect look is then achieved with blonde curly hair, smoky eye make-up, a French manicure and a post-holiday tan, according to the survey.

It said women still aspire to look like the late actress, who starred in the films Dial M for Murder and Rear Window and became Princess Grace of Monaco after marrying Prince Rainier III in 1956.

The poll by beauty and health retailer Superdrug showed 43 per cent of women preferred natural make-up and 84 per cent agreed less is more. But 60 per cent felt under-dressed without make-up.

A majority of women preferred snug-fitting T-shirts when deciding what to wear above the waist, and 16 per cent said they would always wear a vest, reported the Daily Express.

A spokeswoman for Superdrug said the survey showed ‘classic always wins’ - and while women may want to look at the latest fashion icons, ‘we don’t always want to look like them’.

‘Women are opting for clothes which complement their figure and make-up that suits their complexion and colouring,’ the spokeswoman told the Daily Express.

'There’s a time and place for wild and wacky make-up and hair but for the everyday perfect look the classic option is a winner'

Five modern advocates of the leading lady look were listed as Katherine Heigl, Jennifer Aniston, Holly Willoughby, Heidi Klum and Kimberley Walsh, reported the newspaper.

Kelly, who died after a car crash in 1982, was one of the 20th century’s most photographed women and was known for her impeccable chic style.
