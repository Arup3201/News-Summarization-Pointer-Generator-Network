Buying a property can be an overwhelming project, as any new-home owner will tell you.

The investment will probably be the biggest financial output you will undertake, and will take a lot of hard work and research to ensure you are on the right track. 

Knowing the do's and don't's is crucial, especially as Australia's record-making house prices are steadily increasing and safe within a property bubble that doesn't look to burst.

Daily Mail Australia spoke to the country's leading experts to get the best advice for prospective property buyers, ahead of a weekend brimming with auctions in the capital cities.

Know your figures. 

Setting yourself a strict budget, and being disciplined with sticking to it, is the most crucial tip for prospective buyers.

Louis Christopher, Managing Director of SQM Research, told Daily Mail Australia, 'Things get very emotional. When people are desperate to buy a house, they can often exceed the budget they set for themselves, which may seem exciting at the time but will only hurt them in the long run.' 

Knowing your figures also means investigating the market. Spend time looking at what houses in the area have sold for, whether this is through a price guide or by calling agents.

1. Know your figures. Setting yourself a strict budget, and being disciplined with sticking to it, is the most crucial tip for prospective buyers.

2. Get your finances sorted out before you head to an auction. 

3. Shop around for the most competitive mortgage.

4. Get the property inspected.

5. Know your buying tactics.

Peter Kelahar, Director of PK Property, said that this step is crucial in knowing how and even if you should spend your money so that you don't fork out extra hard earned cash unnecessarily.

'Work out a realistic price range,' Kelahar said, 'Take into extra consideration where you live. Don't be afraid to investigate.' 

Get your finances sorted out before you head to an auction.

In the competitive housing market, it's all about being able to move as quickly as possible, but you also need to make sure you have the most competitive mortgage available to you.

'Get your finances approved unconditionally, so if you need to move you  can do it then and there with nothing holding you back,' said Kelahar. 

'You may need to move like lightning, so that you have something to offer over other buyers that might not be as prepared.'

Another multi-million dollar property is this house, nestled in South Yarra in Victoria. It goes under the hammer  at auction on Saturday

This exquisite residence originally designed by Marcus Martin has recently undergone a masterful renovation and extension

The property boasts five bedrooms, each with a private bathroom, a cellar, and private north facing garden and pool

Shop around for the most competitive mortgage.

Louis Christopher of SQM Research encourages prospective buyers to shop around for the best mortgage rate possible. 

'Banks are being quite competitive with the products they offer,' he said, 'So take full advantage by asking lots of questions.'

Get the property inspected.

This is non-negotiable. All properties have quirks, no matter how good they might look in photos, and it is important that before you commit to buying that you have all the facts available to you.

Christopher recommends being creative and specific, tailoring property inspections to your concerns.

'Get a plumber to come in and look at the plumbing. Get a pest controller to check the house out for white ants. Some of the standard inspections wont pick up the issues that really make a difference,' he said.

Know your buying tactics.

If you are buying a house with a partner, be clear and specific about how and when you want to bid. Do some research and visit other auctions in the area, and see how they work. 

If you have your heart set on a property, make sure you've been to a few auctions before so you don't make a rookie mistake and set yourself back. 

'Bidding comes down to evaluation,' said Christopher.  

With a busy weekend for property auctions, it is important to keep in mind that there will be limited stock from now until the end of the October long weekend. This is driving the price up and property stock is tight, and the demand will just push house valuations up even further.

Kelahar advises that many agents will start their campaigns after the October long weekend.

'They're ready to flick the switch,' he said, 'They have all the photos taken and are just waiting for the right time.'

'At the moment it's a bit of a Mexican standoff, where people don't want to put their property up if they can't find somewhere to live. It'll loosen eventually, but just be aware of the trends.'
