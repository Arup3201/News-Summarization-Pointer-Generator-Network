Roberto Martinez has decided to leave two of his first-team players on Merseyside for the trip to Lille as he attempts to juggle domestic and European commitments.

Steven Naismith and Leon Osman are both fit after starting last Saturday's 3-0 win against Aston Villa but the Spaniard has opted to rest both players as he looks ahead to Sunday's visit to Burnley in the Premier League.

Speaking ahead of his side's Europa League clash at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy, Martinez said: 'Steven and Leon have been rested for this trip bearing in mind the number of games we have this month and in terms of their individual circumstances and the number of games they have played.'

Leon Osman has also remained on Merseyside instead of travelling to France with Roberto Martinez's squad

The other two members of Everton's squad unable to travel to France are Bryan Oviedo and Arouna Kone, both of whom are not yet ready to for action.

Oviedo recently underwent minor surgery to remove a screw from his leg after breaking it earlier this year, while Kone is still battling for fitness following a long-term knee injury. 

'Bryan Oviedo and Arouna Kone are not fully match fit, although they are not too far away. They were not 100 per cent for this trip,' Martinez added.

John Stones and Kevin Mirallas are also ruled out having suffered ankle and hamstring injuries respectively in the last month. 

Martinez is also with Bryan Oviedo and Arouna Kone, neither of whom are match fit for Thursday's game
