Southampton's superb start to the season continued as they saw off the challenge of QPR on Saturday. Click here for his stats and all the players' heat maps in our brilliant Match Zone.

Ronald Koeman admitted even he is shocked by the scintillating start to Southampton's season after a win against Queens Park Rangers kept them second in the table.

How the scoreline was not greater was miraculous after twice the woodwork and busy QPR goalkeeper Rob Green kept them at bay until two well-worked moves ended with him beaten.

Thirteen points from their first six league games is their best ever start to the Barclays Premier League and leaves them just three of first-place Chelsea.

Graziano Pelle makes the perfect connection from a cross to score in spectacular fashion as Southampton go 2-1 ahead against QPR

Koeman said: 'I'm a little bit surprised, normally you have to wait after a lot of changes in the team. We had some difficult moments in the club, a lot of people were a little afraid and there questions about relegation. But we know what our qualities are.

'We like to enjoy our offence. Football is to be enjoyed. I believe in a way of playing that will bring points and that is our ambition. It's going well.'

Graziano Pelle's overhead kick in the 68th-minute was a strike worthy of winning any game. Substitute Shane Long crossed from the right, Dusan Tadic nodded the ball back to Pelle who took a touch to flick the ball in the air then sent it into the far top right corner with an acrobatic effort.

It was the striker's fifth goal in eight games since his £8million summer move from Feyenoord.

Just two minutes before it had seemed that Charlie Austin's equaliser would be the best goal seen at St Mary's yesterday [SAT].

The QPR striker produced a sublime moment when he plucked a firm ball by Eduardo Vargas out of the air with his back to goal, spun around and beat Fraser Forster with a low shot.

That they were level was a surprise.

The home side were relentless going forward, but had to wait until the 55th minute to finally break the deadlock.

Tadic switched the ball from right to left, Sadio Mane was on to it in a flash and played a deft back-heel into the path of Ryan Bertrand, the left-back on loan from Chelsea, who fired in first-time under Green.

Their first effort off the upright came in the 19th minute. The bright Mane, making his first Premier League appearance, crossed from the right, Pelle cushioned a header back to Tadic who controlled the ball with his chest before hitting a shot which beat Green via a deflection off Steven Caulker but came back off the left post.

The second came in the 70th minute, after the barrage of goals, when Steven Davies sent a first-time curler from 25 yards crashing off the post.

And Green was sharp again on 79 minutes to rush from goal to block Long's effort when Davies played him through on goal with an audacious first-time ball curved into his path.

Niko Kranjkar struck a 20-yard free kick off the underside of the bar in the final 10 minutes, but the equaliser would have been unfair on Southampton.

QPR manager Harry Redknapp said: 'It was a great finish from Charlie Austin, he's scored two league goals now showing he can do it at this level. There's still lots to work on with the team.'
