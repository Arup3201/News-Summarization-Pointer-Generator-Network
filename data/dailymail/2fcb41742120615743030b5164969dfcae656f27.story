It was one of the year’s most ridiculous films but it seems that some fans have taken the message behind Sharknado quite seriously.

In celebration of Discovery Channel’s Shark Week, one gun fan has decided to test which ammunition would be most effective in fighting off attacking sharks.

Richard Ryan from Rated RR tested three different bullets to find out which would best defend your family.

And as an added bonus, he created some beautiful footage of slow notion bullets travelling through the water.

He said: ‘Your guns and chainsaws might save you on land, but how far will different types of ammunition travel underwater in case a two headed shark is trying to sink your boat.’

Sharknado, starring Tara Reid, is a disaster film about a waterspout that lists sharks out of the ocean and leaves them in Los Angeles

First, Mr Ryan tries a Hornady TAP FFD 9mm hollow point bullet which travelled just over a metre

The collapsing water created beautiful shapes in the water

In an alternative camera angle, the second bullet the Hornady Critical Duty 9mm Flex Tip Hollow Point passes through the water

The water collapsed in on itself, resembling small nuclear explosions

He warns watchers not to try the experiments at home as they are extremely dangerous.

First, Mr Ryan tries a Hornady TAP FFD 9mm hollow point bullet and a Critical Duty 9mm Flex Tip Hollow Point.

The former travelled 110cm into the water while the latter travelled 15cm further.

The Full Metal Jacket made a stunning path through the water as it travelled more than two metres

The Full Metal Jacket bullet was clearly the best one to use against a shark in the event of a Sharknado

The last bullet he tried was a Hornady 9mm Full Metal Jacket which managed a massive 210cm, making it the clear winner.

Mr Ryan also discussed supercavitation technology. Taken from torpedoes, it could allow a gun owner to fire under water accurately up to 60metres.

It also allows the user to fire into the water without it ricocheting off the surface.

At least now we know which ammunition will kill a shark in the event of a real Sharknado
