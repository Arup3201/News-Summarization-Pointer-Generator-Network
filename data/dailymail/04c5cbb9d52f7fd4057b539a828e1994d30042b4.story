'I doubt you will find a better offer than this anywhere else in the public sector,' said union boss Bob Crow

Tube drivers yesterday won a pay deal to boost their average salary to more than £50,000 a year.

The inflation-busting award comes at a time when millions of workers are seeing only paltry rises, or even pay freezes.

The London Underground drivers will be on almost twice the national average full-time salary of around £26,000.

Under the four-year deal, negotiated by militant union bosses at the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers' union, staff will get a 5 per cent pay rise this year.

For the subsequent three years, they will get a pay rise equal to the retail prices index measure of inflation plus 0.5 percentage points.

That would mean a rise of 4.5 per cent if RPI is 4 per cent next year. If the index slides, they are still guaranteed a 2 per cent lift.

In a further boost, the pay deal comes on top of a bonus of up to £1,800 – a one-off £500 payment plus overtime for work during next summer's Olympic games.

Transport for London said the agreement rules out pay strikes until at least 2015 – although other issues may lead to industrial action.

Tory MP Dominic Raab said: 'At a time of financial restraint for businesses and families, this is daylight robbery that will cost users and taxpayers dearly.'

Off the rails: Some drivers will get a £10,000 pay increase under the new agreement

Emma Boon of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'Taxpayers will be left fuming that bullyboy tactics have been rewarded with such a generous deal.

'The size of this inflation-busting pay increase is insulting to commuters who have faced the misery of repeated tube strikes in recent years.'

Over the past year, just one in every 25 workers secured a pay deal worth 5 per cent or more, according to an authoritative analysis by the pay experts XpertHR.

The average for the private sector worker was 2.3 per cent.

Industry sources said Eurostar drivers
earn around £53,000, while drivers on the East Coast Mainline earn 
around £50,000. Virgin Train counterparts get around £48,000.

Bob Crow, the hardline general 
secretary of the RMT, who earns £84,000 plus benefits, said: 'In these 
days of austerity, we have shown that fighting trade unionism is the 
best defence from attacks on jobs and living standards.

'I doubt you will find a better offer anywhere else in the public sector.'

But Andrew Cave, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: 'Small business owners will view this deal with astonishment.

'Many have stopped paying themselves a wage in order to keep existing members of staff.'

Mike Brown, managing director of London Underground, insisted the pay deal was fair and affordable.

The calculation of a Tube driver's 
average salary is based on the current level of £42,500, plus official 
inflation estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility.
