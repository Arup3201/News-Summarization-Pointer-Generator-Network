Boston Mayor Marty Walsh has proposed to make the school day 40 minutes longer for around 23,000 public school students.

Walsh announced in a press conference on Friday that around 60 elementary and middle schools could host longer days in the hopes that children will gain a more comprehensive education.

Teachers in the Boston Teacher Union will be able to vote on the new plan on January 14.

In addition to longer days, teachers would make an annual stipend of $4,464 to pay for their extra hours of work.

The Boston Globe reports that the plan would only be implemented at 20 schools in the fall and then includes 20 more schools in each of the next two years.

High schools and private schools would not be affected by the plan.

'We know that when our students have more time to learn, they have a better chance of succeeding,' said Walsh.

'I thank the Boston Teachers Union and the Boston Public Schools for their partnership in helping us reach this milestone that will strengthen our education system and help us close the achievement gap so we can give all of our young people the opportunity to succeed,' he added.

Walsh said that the extra 40 per day of class work is the equivalent of adding an extra month of instruction for elementary school students.

The head of the Boston Teacher’s union, Richard Stutman, supported the plan.

'The school day extension will help our students by offering well planned, school-based instruction that promotes teaching and learning while allowing for increased participation in a variety of under-served subject areas, such as art, music, drama and foreign language,' said Stutman.

'We are pleased to have been part of a truly collaborative effort that brought this about,' he added.

CBS reports that extending the school day would cost around $12.5 million per year once all 60 schools are affected.

'With this agreement we are transforming the definition of the 'school day' in the Boston Public Schools,' said BPS Interim Superintendent John McDonough.
