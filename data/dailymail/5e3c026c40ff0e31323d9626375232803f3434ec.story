A school which asked students to compare Martin Luther King to convicted cop-killer Mumia Abu-Jamal in a lesson plan has been branded an 'absolute disgrace'.

Maureen Faulkner, whose husband Daniel was shot by Abu-Jamal in 1981, blasted the taxpayer-funded plan, saying it advocated violence.

The lesson, given to students in Oakland, California, asked them to draw a 'possible parallel' between civil rights activist King, and 'someone else many believe is currently targeted by the U.S. government, Mumia Abu-Jamal.'

Students were asked to compare Mumia Abu-Jamal (left), who was convicted of killing a policeman in 1981, and Martin Luther King Jr. who had a policy of strict non-violence

Speaking to Fox News, Maureen said: 'It’s a travesty. You’re going to teach children about a man who murdered a police officer?

'That’s not a good lesson to be teaching children. He was a radical, a militant.'

The plan, written by teacher Craig Gordon and designed for 11h grade students, also asks them to consider the following statement: 'The media, prison system and law enforcement organizations have censored Mumia Abu-Jamal.

'On one hand, there have been occasional stories in print and broadcast media about Mumia Abu-Jamal.

'On the other, despite the widespread support for Abu-Jamal that has made his case the most renown and controversial of death penalty cases in the world today, these stories are extremely rare and always refer to him as a "convicted cop-killer."'

The plan was posted on the Oakland 
Unified School District’s website. Troy Flint, spokesman for the 
district, said the lesson plan is no longer part of the curriculum.

'The
 fact that a website documenting Urban Dreams remains accessible is an 
oversight related to technology management; it does not speak to current
 instructional practice in OUSD,' Flint told Fox News in an e-mail.

Daniel Faulker was killed during an early-morning traffic stop in Philadelphia in 1981

'To avoid any confusion in the future, we will conduct an inventory of the numerous websites created to support learning districtwide to ensure they conform with our present academic philosophy and do not inadvertently misrepresent Oakland schools.'

Mumia Abu-Jamal was convicted of Daniel Faulkner's murder after his brother got into a scuffle with the policeman during a 4am traffic stop in Philadelphia.

Faulkner was shot several times and died at the scene, Abu-Jamal was later found with a bullet wound from Faulker's gun, and a .38 calibre handgun registered to Abu-Jamal was found at the scene.

It took a Pennsylvania jury just thre hours to find him guilty and he was sentenced to death.

However, over the years Abu-Jamal challenged the predominantly white makeup of the jury, the instructions given to the jurors and the accounts of eyewitnesses.

Abu-Jamal had his sentence reduced to life in jail in 2011 after three decades of campaigning by supporters

He also said that his lawyer was ineffective, that the judge was racist and that another man confessed to the crime.

The one-time journalist's own 1995 book, 'Live From Death Row,' depicts prison life and calls the justice system racist.

He got worldwide support from the 'Free Mumia' movement, with hundreds of vocal supporters and death-penalty opponents regularly turning out for court hearings in his case.

In 2011 the sentence was downgraded to life imprisonment after Maureen Faulker agreed to the decision.

The niece of Martin Luther King, Alevda, said she was not familiar with Abu-Jamal's case, but that anybody seking to understand her uncle should start with his policy of non-violence.
