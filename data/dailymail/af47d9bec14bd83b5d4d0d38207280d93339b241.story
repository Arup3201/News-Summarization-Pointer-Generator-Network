Apple will begin initial production of its next iPhone model in March for an expected launch in June or July, an influential analyst has claimed.

Peter Misek of investment bank Jeffries, who was ahead of others with news that Apple had cut orders for components for the iPhone 5, made the prediction in a note to investors.

The news comes as a string of analysts denied that the Silicon Valley firm's decision to slash orders for iPhone 5 parts was prompted by a fall in demand for their latest smart phone.

That revelation sent Apple shares slipping below $500 - as arch-rival Samsung announced it had sold 40million of its flagship Galaxy S III phone in the seven months its been on the market.

Mr Misek predicted in his note that iPhone sales could begin to drop as customers anticipate the arrival of the next model, but he nonetheless said he expects between 44million to ship in the quarter to March.

'As word of the earlier production schedule starts to spread, we believe we could see a slight slowing of demand CQ1 in anticipation of the new product launch and Apple will likely start curtailing channel inventory,' he was quoted as saying by StreetInsider.

'Therefore we tweak down our CQ1 iPhone shipment estimate from 48M to 44M, which is still well above widespread fears of shipments in the mid-30Ms.'

The analyst's prediction of a summer launch date for the 5S is a reiteration of claims he made last month, when he said he expects the new phone to ship in various colours and with improved battery life.

He last month also predicted that the 
new model could ship with a new 4.8in display, a claim he rowed back 
from in this week's note where he said he now expects that to be the 
design for a forthcoming iPhone 6.

(LTE) capability.

Apple will launch five new products in the next 12 months, including its highly anticipated TV set, two leading analysts claimed today.

Analysts Gene Munster and Douglas Clinton of Piper Jaffray say the firm will launch a plethora of new products in a bid to keep its position as the world's biggest company.

However, the analysts say the new gadgets could be just the beginning of a major change in Apple's products in 2014.

The pair told Fortune magazine 2013 'will set the stage for bigger changes in the product lineup in 2014 and beyond.'

Apple is believed to develop products several years in advance, with its design team, led by British-born Sir Jonathan Ive, producing hundreds of prototype products each year.

The speculation seemed to be backed up by comments made by Paul Schiller, Apple's marketing chief, who recently told Chinese newspaper the Shanghai Evening News that 'despite the popularity of cheap smartphones, this well never be the future of Apple's products.'

Mr Misek's predictions came as a string of analysts suggested that Apple's decision to slash orders for iPhone 5 components might not be a result of weak demand for the device.

Earlier this week, MailOnline Science reported how the iconic gadget company had told suppliers it only wanted half the number of screens it had originally asked for and reduced orders for other parts too.

Apple is said to have have told its suppliers about the change last month. It will apply to orders from now until the end of March and comes after Apple has come under intense pressure from Samsung and other phones which use Googleâ€™s Android operating system.

But Shaw Wu, an analyst with brokers Sterne Agee, was quoted by the Telegraph as telling investors that 'as far as we can tell, iPhone 5 demand remains robust.'

He added that the change in orders could be down to 'much improved yields meaning lower component builds and supplier shifts.'
