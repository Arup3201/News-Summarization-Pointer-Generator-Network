Blow a dandelion and make a wish, goes the saying... and one dog-walker was certainly spoilt for choice today as the field before him contained thousands of them.

Robert Wolstenholme, a nature 
reserve warden for Natural England, had taken his dog Mazy for some exercise near his 
home in Great Somerford, Wiltshire.

To his amazement, the 52-year-old saw a sea of white seeds in the distance as he took his flat-coated retriever for a morning stroll.

Mr Wolstenhome could barely see the green grass in the field as thousands of the weed's seeds covered the ground.

He said: 'I was walking my dog by the river and, when I looked across, I couldn't believe the sea of white in the field.

'It was a brilliant and breathtaking sight. You could hardly see any grass.'

After walking around the huge five hectare field, Mr Wolstenholme stopped in the area that caught his eye to take photographs.

He added: 'The field is huge and I 
walked for a while to find the area that had the most dandelions so I 
could capture the best moment.

'There were around 500 dandelions per square metre and it was covering it all - it was an amazing sight.'

Mr Wolstenholme said that the lack of wind and rain in the area has resulted in an abundance of dandelion seeds.

He continued: 'There hasn't been a lot of wind and rain in Great Somerford in recent weeks so the dandelion seeds haven't blown away like they normally would.'

The dandelion seeds are normally dispersed after being carried on the wind like tiny parachutes.

Dry and sunny for Bank Holiday... but first, a few showers

More wet weather is on the way but the Bank Holiday weekend looks set to be dry and sunny, forecasters say.

After some heavy showers on Friday most of the country will enjoy decent weather with temperatures reaching up to 62F (17C) in the south - on par with Paris, Barcelona and Venice.

Temperatures will be slightly cooler in the north and could dip to as low as 8C in some places.

But Met Office forecaster Helen Chivers said this should clear away by the weekend, adding: 'It will be nice pretty much everywhere.'

She added: 'We've got some cold, windy and wet weather to come over the next couple of days because of a low pressure system moving eastwards across the country.

'Thursday and Friday temperatures will not be terribly high, only reaching between 11 and 13C, and a bit colder in some places. 

'But after that, Saturday and Sunday look pretty decent days for the Bank Holiday at the moment.

'It will be dry in most places with some sunshine as well.

'On Saturday, temperatures will reach 60F (16C) while we'll see temperatures of 62F (17C) on Sunday in the south. It might still feel a little cool in the shade but should feel pretty warm in the sun.'

Ms Chivers said it won't top the 84F (23.8C) - the warmest day of the year so far - we had on May 7 in Drumburgh in Cumbria but will bring us back to average temperatures for this time of year.

By Monday, the nice weather will tail off in some parts with spells of rain, particularly in Northern Ireland and western Scotland.

And forecasters warned anyone planning a trip in the mountains should expect potentially hazardous conditions.

'Scotland will be the worst-hit place so if anyone is walking in the mountains, they should be careful to prepare themselves as there is likely to be snow and high winds. 

'It will feel particularly cold,' Ms Chivers added.

Dandelion seeds are carried on the wind like tiny parachutes

On a breezy day, a dandelion seed can be blown miles from its parent plant. The parachute part of the seed drops off when it strikes an obstacle, which is why so many grow in crevices next to walls. Above, golden dandelions by the Grand Canal in Dublin
