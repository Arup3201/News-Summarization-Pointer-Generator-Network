Nicolas Anelka may have left West Brom six months ago, but the controversy that led to his sacking is still following him.

Anelka signed up to the new Indian Super League on Monday, and on Tuesday afternoon his new club Mumbai City took to Twitter to welcome their high-profile striker.

But the Indian side attempted to remove Anelka's time in the West Midlands from the history books, listing his former clubs only until his departure from Juventus, where he spent six months on loan. 

Mumbai City's tweet subtly removed Anelka's time at West Brom from his list of clubs. It was soon deleted

The tweet, which also ignored Anelka's time with Shanghai Shenhua, presented the French striker as a combination of speed and firepower, and was deleted soon after.

Anelka was sacked by West Brom in March 2014 after performing the controversial 'quenelle' gesture whilst celebrating a goal against West Ham three months earlier.

The gesture is widely accepted to be anti-semitic, and although Anelka denied that he intended it to be understood as such, he was given a five-match ban from football which he is yet to serve.
