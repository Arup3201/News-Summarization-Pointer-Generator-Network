Shrien Dewani was framed for the murder of his wife by his driver and two hitmen after a kidnap and ransom plan turned sour, the British businessman’s trial heard today.

In a dramatic twist to the murder hearing, Dewani’s senior lawyer told the court that a convicted murderer would be called as a witness to describe how Zola Tongo boasted of making Dewani a scapegoat when his new bride Anni was killed by mistake.

Tongo, the state’s ’star witness’ against Dewani, told the 'lifer' that a plan to kidnap Mrs Dewani, 28, and demand a ransom from her wealthy husband ended in murder when one of her two kidnappers attempted to rape her, the court heard.

The Swedish engineer fought off her attacker and was killed when a gun went off as her two attackers fought, defence lawyer Francois van Zyl said.

With the unplanned death of the honeymooning bride on their hands, Tongo’s first idea was to blackmail 34 year-old Dewani, but this was scrapped in favour of framing him for her murder, Cape Town's high court heard.

Bernard Mitchell claims Tongo confessed to the plot when the two occupied nearby cells in October 2011. The inmate, known as Bino, approached Dewani’s lawyers with the confession when Dewani was fighting extradition to South Africa to face charges over his wife's death.

Dewani denies recruiting taxi driver Tongo to organise the murder of his new Swedish wife shortly after they arrived in Cape Town for part of their honeymoon in November 2010. Tongo and two hitmen - Mziwamadoda Qwabe and Xolile Mngeni - claim the successful businessman masterminded the plot to kill the Swedish engineer and promised to pay them £850.

Mr van Zyl told the court Mrs Dewani’s fatal wounds, from a single bullet that hit her hand and then her neck, were consistent with a struggle rather than “an execution”.

Dewani denies five charges relating to the death of his new bride, including murder and kidnapping.

Dewani sat upright in the dock, occasionally nodding and smiling at his parents and siblings, as the court heard that Mitchell contacted Dewani’s lawyer, Taswell Paper, about a conversation he claimed to have had while showering next to Tongo, which began as an exchange about their prison sentences.

The state alleges Dewani plotted his new wife's murder by recruiting taxi driver Zola Tongo to organise two hitmen to kill and rob her in a fake carjacking worth £850 (R15,000)

'You remarked that you saw that he [Mitchel] got life,' Mr van Zyl told Tongo, who was giving his seventh day of evidence. 'He said he saw you got 18 years. And you then told him that you are glad you didn't get life, and you explained to him, when he asked why, that you were for fortunate to become a state witness, otherwise you would have also got life in prison.

'At one stage he asked you to tell him whether its true what he heard people talk about the Dewani murder. You did not want to talk, but he convinced you that you could trust him.

'He asked "why was the woman killed? She was such a pretty girl. Why didn't they just rape her?" 

'You then said that your accusers who were with you in this jeopardised the whole plan. You explained to him that the plan was to kidnap her and to hold her hostage, but that the whole plan went off the rails as, when your accusers were on the way with her to the place where they wanted to hold her hostage, one of them wanted to rape her. A quarrel ensued and she was shot. You were informed of this.

'You then talked about blackmailing Mr Dewani, threatening him that if he doesn't pay you the money, you will tell the police that he asked you to kill his wife.'

'Bernard Mitchell said that you him that you were advised this was a stupid plan and would put you in trouble and that it would be better to frame Mr Dewani and to tell the police that it was the accused, Mr Dewani, who asked you to kill his wife to take the spotlight off you and the others.

'You were advised that in that case you would not get such a long sentence,' Mr van Zyl said.

Asked for his response to the story that Mitchell will tell the court, Tongo dismissed it as 'nonsense and lies.'

'This is somebody who saw this on TV. Those are just prison stories,' Tongo said.

The Hindocha family - Mrs Dewani’s parents Nilam and Vinod and brother Anish - shook their heads in disbelief as Mr van Zyl painted a picture of Dewani as the victim of a complicated conspiracy.

And as Tongo finally stepped down from the witness box after more than five days of heated cross-examination, the father of five, clenched his fist and punched the air as he passed one of the police officers who had brought the case against Dewani, before being bundled out of the court.

Earlier, Mr van Zyl told Judge Jeanette Traverso how Dewani had handed over R15,000 (£850 pounds) – exactly the amount Tongo claims he was offered for Mrs Dewani’s contract killing – in gifts to people who had supported him in the hours and days after his wife’s death.

The cash was enclosed in African-themed greetings cards in which he had written messages and handed to hotel staff and even one of the police officers who were investigating his wife’s death.

Tongo, who claims Dewani failed to pay him the £260 he had been promised to organise a fake carjacking to cover for Mrs Dewani’s death, told the court, “I am surprised that he gave such amounts to people but he could not pay me.”
