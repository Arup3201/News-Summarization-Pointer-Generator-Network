A man who allegedly shot dead his ex-girlfriend after sending her two daughters out to collect fried chicken has been caught after trying to kill himself when police officers arrived to arrest him.

On Thursday night, detectives tracked down Eric McCormick, 40, in Hurleyville, New York - more than 100 miles from where he allegedly shot dead Sellis Gonzales, 44, on September 18.

When officers knocked on the door, they heard a shot, police sources told the New York Daily News. But he only sustained a graze from the bullet and was taken into custody.

He is now being treated at Catskill Regional Medical Center.

McCormick is accused of killing Gonzales in her Brownsville apartment after giving her daughters, five-year-old Alyssa and 15-year-old Khadija, $8 to buy fried chicken.

But when the girls returned home 15 minutes later, they found their mother lying in a pool of blood inside the door after sustaining three bullet wounds to the head and three to the body.

Khadija called police and then frantically called her grandmother in North Carolina.

'My mother is on the floor covered in blood,' she said, her grandmother, Ursula Gonzales, told the Daily News. She said police told the girls to leave the apartment.

McCormick, a cross-country truck driver, is Alyssa's father. Family members branded him 'controlling' and said he had abused his former girlfriend in the past.

They claimed that he had assaulted her while she was pregnant with Alyssa.

Police were called to an incident at the home in 2008 and at one point, she took out an order of protection against McCormick - but it expired.

The family, who are originally from Trinidad, said they were relieved to learn that McCormick had been taken into police custody.

'I just burst into tears. I bawled the office down,' her brother Kirt Gonzales, 46, told the Daily News.

As well as her young daughters, Gonzalez also leaves behind a 24-year-old son.
