A cystic fibrosis patient has married his girlfriend after having a successful lung transplant.

Dane Pollard, 34, was diagnosed with the condition when he was 18 months old and feared he would not survive.

The condition caused his lungs to fill with mucus, meaning he needed daily physiotherapy in order to lead a normal life.

Dane Pollard met and married his partner, Emma, after his life was saved by a last minute lung transplant

Mr Pollard was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis when he was 18 months old and his health slowly deteriorated

However, his health worsened and he found himself needing a wheelchair and additional oxygen.

He eventually ended up housebound and was put on the lung transplant list.

In 2008, he received a call to say that some new lungs had been found for him and the operation could go ahead.

He believes that if the lungs had not become available, he would not have survived for many more days.

Since the surgery, Mr Pollard, from Manchester, has met his partner, Emma, 33, and the couple married earlier this month.

Mr Pollard, a songwriter, said: 'Before I had the transplant I couldn’t even leave the house.

'I can’t believe how lucky I was to not only get my lung transplant, but then to go on to meet the woman of my dreams. 

'Without the transplant I almost certainly wouldn’t have survived and gone on to meet Emma.

'We got married at Manchester Register Office before heading to Barcelona for a second, bigger wedding. 

'The transplant came just in time for me. It’s fantastic to be able to live the life I want to and to be able to celebrate our special day.'

Mr Pollard started going out about one year after his transplant and met his future wife in January 2010.

Mr Pollard had the transplant but it was a year before he was well enough to start going out and meeting people again. When he had recovered, he met his partner, Emma

He said: 'Requiring oxygen and help to get around made it very difficult to leave the house.

'The emotional and psychological aspect of recovery from my transplant meant it took me a while to integrate myself back into society.

'It was a struggle after being ill and housebound for some time prior.

'But after about a year I felt well enough to start going out and meeting new people.

'It is difficult to tell people that you’ve had a transplant - some people run a mile - but Emma’s cousin’s wife suffers from CF so she was very understanding.'

The couple got engaged in January 2013 in Barcelona.

Project manager Mrs Pollard said: 'Dane did everything properly - he asked my parents two days before we went away and took the ring with us.

'But then on the night nothing went to plan. It was New Year’s Eve and we were closed into the main square.

'Dane ended up proposing next to a bin - I’ll never let him forget that.'Mr Pollard, whose band is called Modern Sound Library, has written a song dedicated to his donor and hopes to raise funds for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust.

Mr Pollard (pictured with his wife) believes people should be able to opt out of being an organ donor, rather than having to opt in if they want their organs to be considered for donation

It is called Thank You and will feature backing vocals from other CF suffers.

He hopes to raise awareness of the condition and encourage more people to join the organ donation register.

He said: 'It should be made easier for people to have the transplants that they need. I believe that people should have to opt out of being a donor instead of opting in.'

Ed Owen, the Cystic Fibrosis Trust's chief executive, said: 'We are calling on all bodies responsible for transplantation policy to work with us and act on our recommendations to ensure those waiting for a transplant get the organs they so desperately need and to bring new hope to their lives.'

Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition which causes the lungs and the digestive system to become clogged with mucus.

Symptoms usually appear in early childhood and they include a persistent cough, recurring chest infections and failure to thrive.

As the condition develops, a lung transplant may be required.

There is no cure for cystic fibrosis so treatment revolves around relieving symptoms and reducing long-term damage caused by infections.

The most common treatments are physiotherapy to clear the mucus from the lungs, and antibiotics to treat infections.

The condition is caused by a genetic mutation which allows too much salt and water into cells - this results in a build-up of mucus.

For a child to inherit the condition, both of their parents have to be carriers of the mutated gene.

In this situation, there is a one in four chance the child will not inherit either of the faulty genes, a one in two chance they will inherit one of them and be a carrier but not a sufferer, and a one in four chance they will inherit both genes and suffer from the condition.

About one in every 2,500 babies born in the UK are born with cystic fibrosis.

As treatments have improved, the outlook for these children has improved dramatically.

But, life expectancy remains in the 40s.
