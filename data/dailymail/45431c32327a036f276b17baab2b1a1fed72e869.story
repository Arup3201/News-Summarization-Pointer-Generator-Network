Science minister David Willetts has called for EU controls on GM crops and food to be relaxed

Controls on ‘Frankenstein Food’ crops should be slimmed down to clear the way for commercial cultivation, according to Britain’s science minister.

David Willetts, who has been heavily lobbied by GM campaigners and scientists funded by the GM industry, insists biotech crops could feed the world.

Mr Willetts in the science department and the environment secretary, Owen Paterson, are pushing for EU controls on new GM crops and food to be relaxed.

The move is at odds with the views of most British consumers, who are suspicious of the impact of GM crops on human health and the environment.

Official research by the Government’s Food Standards Agency(FSA) suggests shoppers actually want more information about GM and how it is getting on to dinner tables by stealth.

Currently, a large part of the meat, milk and eggs in stores comes from farm animals fed a GM diet, such as genetically modified soya and maize, however consumers are kept in the dark.

Ministers have ignored a recent FSA study which found that two in three people want any food derived from a animals fed on GM to declare the fact on the label.

Mr Willetts insisted that EU controls on various new types of technology ranging from GM crops and food to stem cell research and nanotechnology are far too restrictive.

‘We believe that GM crops can help make agriculture more efficient, and also just as importantly more sustainable by, for example, reducing the use of pesticides and the use of fossil fuels,’ he said.

‘There are just too many 21st-century technologies that Europe is just being very slow to adopt ... one productive way forward is to have this discussion as part of a wider need for Europe to remain innovative rather than a museum of 20th century technology.’

Uncertainties: But the majority of British consumers are suspicious about the impact of GM crops on human health and want any food derived from animals fed a GM diet to declare it on the label

He added: ‘By the time you’ve added up 
the French overregulation of nanotechnology, the Brüstle judgment on 
stem cells (where the European Court of Justice blocked a scientist from
protecting his research with a patent), the fact that there isn’t a 
regime that would permit the use of innovative space vehicles, you’re 
left with a great weight of regulation.’

James Watson, who shared the Nobel Prize for his co-discovery of the structure of DNA, also defended GM.

‘The educated middle classes just don’t like genetics, and now they don’t want GM food either because they’re worried about safety, but the truth is it’s probably safer,’ he said.

In 2011, a team of doctors in Canada found that toxins implanted into GM food crops to kill pests were reaching the bloodstreams of women and unborn babies.

Some 93 per cent of blood samples taken from pregnant women and 80 per cent of umbilical cords were positive for traces of the chemicals. It is not known what, if any, harm could be caused.

Eight governments have banned cultivation of a Monsanto GM maize called MON 810, which is genetically modified to kill pests which feed on it, on the basis it might cause harm to other important insects. The ban on the maize and other forms of GM has been made under an EU environmental protection provision known as the ‘Safeguard Clause’.

The eight are Germany, Austria, Bulgaria, France, Greece, Hungary, Luxembourg and most recently Poland, while Italy said it plans to follow suit.

As a result, the US GM giant Monsanto has effectively given up on lobbying to get approval for new GM crops to be grown in Europe.

Spokesman, Brandon Mitchner, said: ‘We are no longer working on lobbying for more cultivation in Europe.

‘Currently we do not plan to apply for the approval of new genetically modified crops. The reason is, among other things, low demand of the farmers.’

This was confirmed by a spokesman for Monsanto Germany, Ursula Luttmer-Ouazane, who said: ‘We’ve understood that such plants don’t have any broad acceptance in European societies. It is counterproductive to fight against windmills.’

Other GM companies, such as Bayer CropScience, BASF and Syngenta, have also dramatically scaled back or dropped efforts to get their crops accepted in Europe.
