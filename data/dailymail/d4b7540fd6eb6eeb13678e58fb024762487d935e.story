United by grief, estranged husband and wife Matthew and Madonna Badger embraced each other as their three young daughters' caskets were carried into a Manhattan church this morning.

Their faces creased with despair, the former couple held onto each other tightly as their new partners rested comforting hands on their shoulders ahead of the funeral service.

Mrs Badger's boyfriend Michael Borcina, who escaped the Stamford, Connecticut blaze that claimed the lives of the three young girls in the early hours of Christmas Day, held onto the grieving mother.

And standing behind her boyfriend, Abby Ballin rested a gentle hand on Mr Badger's shoulder.

Huddled together, the group was joined by nearly 700 people wishing to pay their respects to the young
sisters who perished with their grandparents on Christmas morning.

The victims were killed by flames that ravaged the waterfront mansion after Mr Borcina took still-lit embers from the fireplace and took them outside. They later sparked the deadly 5 a.m. inferno.

The 'Service in Thanksgiving for the 
Lives of Lilian, Sarah and Grace Badger', held at St. Thomas Church in New York City, was 
attended by friends, relatives and recognisable faces from their 
mother's successful fashion career.

'My little girls are not gone from us
entirely because my little girls are in my heart. Right here. And this 
is where they live,' Mrs Badger, 47, said during the service.

She described each of her daughters in a eulogy to her 'little girl tribe', the New York Daily News reported.

She recalled Lily's brilliant smile, Sarah's love and Grace's fearlessness and adoration for her sisters.

Badger said Lily was 'my angel and my life and she was my firstborn.'

'Lily was naturally shy, but when she
let her smile glow it glowed completely,' Badger said. 'She had better 
dance moves than Michael Jackson.'

Lilyâ€™s 7-year-old twin sisters, Grace and Sarah, both looked up to their big sister, she said.

Sarah was 'my little whippersnapper, loved and lovable and full of love.'

Grace was 'fearless' but 'asked a thousand times if she was going to die before me,' Badger said. 'I said, "No. That's never going to happen. But it did, and I wonder why. Why my children? Why my parents?'

Badger told mourners, 'In all the incomprehensible loss and chaos, all I can hang onto is that love is everything.'

Before the service, loved ones embraced each other on the church steps, with some wearing dark glasses to hide their tears.

They watched as the small wooden coffins were carried into the church by 18 of the Stamford firefighters who responded to the fire.

Former
colleagues of Mrs Badger, who worked as an art director for Calvin Klein, 
showed their support for the grieving family. Designers Vera Wang and 
Calvin Klein himself attended the service.

Respects: The girls' coffins are carried in front of the church on Fifth Avenue, which was closed for the event

Sadness: The girls died after fireplace embers were put outside - because they did not want Santa to be burned

The Gothic-style church, filled with lilies and faux evergreen boughs from Christmas, was brimming with well-wishers well before the service began.

The
program featured a photograph of nine-year-old Lily and 
her seven-year-old twin sisters, Sarah and Grace, laughing together, 
wearing summer dresses.

Readings at the service included Bible 
passages: 'Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them 
not,' and 'For every time there is a season'.

Songs were performed to honour the three sisters, including Amazing Grace and This 
Little Light of Mine.

Singer-songwriter Rufus Wainwright sang an a cappella version of 'Over the Rainbow' during the service, which also featured hymns performed by St. Thomas' all-male choir.

'The family is here today to privately 
remember, mourn and honor their beloved Lily, Sarah and Grace as well as
Lormer and Pauline Johnson,' family friend Kate Askew said in a 
statement. 'It has been an incredibly, incredibly difficult time.'

After attending the service, Stamford Fire Chief Antonio Conte added: 'The closure you are looking for when you see those little caskets, it just doesn't come.'

A private service will be held later 
at Woodlawn Cemetery for the girls' grandparents, Lomer and Pauline 
Johnson, who also perished in the flames.

Embers in a bag of discarded ashes 
started the blaze on Christmas Day at the $1.7million 
property, officials have said.

Mr Borcina had taken them out of a fireplace so the children would not worry about 
Santa coming down the chimney.

Fire officials said he then placed the ashes in or outside an entryway, near rubbish bins.

All victims died of smoke inhalation, 
while Lomer Johnson also suffered a blunt head and neck trauma, which 
resulted from a fall as he attempted to save one of his granddaughters.

Loss: Mrs Badger arrives with Mr Borcina. They were the sole survivors of the blaze that destroyed her home

Mr Borcina told fire officials he had tried to flee with two of the girls, but amid the chaos of the flames, the girls apparently panicked and ran upstairs, according to Stamford fire chief, Antonio J. Conte.

One of the girls, found dead just 
inside a window, had been placed on a pile of books, apparently so 
Johnson could reach in and grab her after he jumped out. But it is 
believed he fell through the roof.

Mrs Badger and Mr Borcina were treated at a hospital for smoke inhalation.

Police and fire officials are investigating the blaze. They want to know whether there were smoke alarms at the home, as 
well as the status of its renovation and whether the contractor had 
permits.

The 
Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection has said that neither 
Borcina nor his company, Tiberias Construction Inc., was registered to 
perform home improvement work in the state.

The agency said it did not yet have 
enough information about what work may have been done or completed and 
would not comment on whether it will investigate.

Stamford authorities deemed the house unsafe following the fire and ordered it torn down the day after.

Fire Chief Antonio Conte said the fire was Stamford's deadliest since a 1987 blaze that also killed five people.

Matthew and Madonna Badger have set up The Other 364 Foundation to collect donations to 'champion compassion' in the girls' memories.
