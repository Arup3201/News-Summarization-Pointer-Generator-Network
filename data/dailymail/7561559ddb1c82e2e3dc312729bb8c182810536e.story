New footage of a terrifying skydiving accident caused when two planes collided in mid-air shows the frantic split seconds as the jumpers scramble out of the plummeting wreckage.

The video is a jumper's eye-view from deep inside the Cessna aircraft during the dramatic crash 12,000ft above Superior, Wisconsin, last month.

It captures the screams of panic as the skydivers realise their aircraft is about to slam into the plane below them.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

On a wing and a prayer: An explosion engulfs one of the skydivers as he clings to a wing

As three thrill-seekers 
edge out of the Cessna's wing, the fuselage of the other aircraft rears 
into view on the video taken from a helmet-mounted camera on one of the 
last in the queue to dive.

It
 shows those on the wing hurled on to the roof of the lower plane and 
momentarily pinned between the aircraft. One skydiver clings onto a bar 
holding while he is spun upside down.

The skydivers are flung around like rag dolls by the violent impact which ripped one wing off and caused a fireball to erupt. 

Queuing: The skydiver waits in line to jump from the plane 12,000ft above the ground

Too close for comfort: The tracking plane below edges closer as the skydivers prepare to jump:

Drama: As three skydivers edge out of the plane, the other aircraft rears into view

Fear: The jumpers scream as they realise they are on a collision course

Collision: The two planes slam into each other, throwing several of the skydivers clear of the wreckage

Squashed: Several of the skydivers find themselves pressed between both planes

Impact: The skydivers are violently shaken as the planes collide

Those on the wing manage to jump clear
 of the burning wreckage, but the video shows several skydivers frantic 
efforts to scramble to the door and leap clear.

While the plane spirals out of control, the disorientated jumpers find their way to the opening of the mangled aircraft. 

All nine skydivers miraculously survived their brush with death.

Matt Fandler, who piloted the plane which exploded in a fireball was able to bailout and pull his emergency parachute.

Blake Weldan, the pilot of the other aircraft, managed to fly his badly damaged plane back to the airport in one piece.

Terror: The wings of the planes smash together as the skydivers desperately cling on

Terror: One of the jumpers grabs hold of part of the wing as the plane spins violently out of control

Fireball: The stunned skydiver is still clutching the wing of the damaged plane as an explosion erupts

Disorientated: The new video shows one of the skydivers being flung around as he tries waits to clear debris before releasing

Shock: A skydiver is flung head over heels as he holds on to the wing of the plane which is plummeting out of the air

Relief: Finally, the skydiver who was trapped at the back of the plane is able to leap from the open door and to safety 

Matt Fandler was at the controls of one of two single-engine planes that were flying over Superior, Wisconsin, with a group of experienced skydivers who were making their last jump of the day, during an interview last month.

But what was supposed to be a moment of perfectly-timed
 air acrobatics and exhilarating free-falls turned into a terrifying 
jump-for-your-life situation when Fandler's Cessna suddenly sandwiched on top 
of the other.

Explosion: Skydivers watched on powerlessly as one of the two planes disintegrated after impact

Impact: This is the moment the two planes hit, sending divers who were preparing to jump flying out of the aircraft and causing the wing of the other to come off

Incredible: Five of the skydivers involved in the Wisconsin plane crash can be seen freefalling and the plane Matt Fandler was flying on flames and hurtling to the ground

Split apart: Both wings of the lead plane became detached and Robinson said he watched it crash to the ground in three pieces

Falling pieces: Several people in the Superior area reported seeing the plane falling to the ground but no one was injured by the debris

Quick thinking: The pilot of the tracking plane was able to land it safely, but the lead plane was not so lucky. It crashed to the ground in several piece. The pilot of that airplane escaped by parachute as well

Speaking about the moment he said: 'And all of a sudden I hear this loud bang. I didn't see 
anything...I just heard a bang and the windshield immediately 
shattered.'

The crash tore off the wing of the 
plane and the gas tank blew up underneath and caught fire, causing the 
plane to go into an 'uncontrolled descent'.

'I was staring straight ahead. And the first thing I remember thinking 
is that I need to regain control of this airplane,' the 23-year-old told Matt Lauer 
in an exclusive Dateline interview airing tonight at 8pm.

'And I 
immediately pulled the yoke back to my chest and pulled it back as far 
as I possibly could. And there was no reaction from the airplane.

'I began to pick up more and more airspeed. And I realize that I have no
 control of this aircraft. And probably thought it was in my best 
interest to not be in this aircraft.'

Bloody: After Fandler landed safely on the ground, he took a 'selfie' to document his injuries, his face covered in blood from where the windshield shattered in his face after the planes collided

Survivor: Matt Fandler was at the controls of one of two single-engine planes that were flying over Superior, Wisconsin, and tells Matt Lauer for NBC's Dateline about his death-defying leap

Fortunately he was wearing a 
parachute and though he had only done two tandem jumps before, he had to
 recall everything he learned as he jumped head first from the gap where
 the wing used to be.

He got himself into the proper arched position for a free fall and 
withstood the temptation to open the chute immediately, waiting until he
 was at the recommended 4,000 to 5,000 feet, NBC reports.

He landed hard somewhere near the runway and somersaulted to a stop.

When
 he realized he was OK he decided to take a picture of himself to 
document his injuries.

Had he not, then the 23-year-old would not have 
believed he had done what he did, he reveals on the Dateline special.

The photo shows his face covered in blood from the shards of 
glass that flew at him when the Cessna's windshield shattered on impact.

He also had serious cuts on his hands not seen in the picture that took 25 stitches to repair.

Wisconsin skydivers: When asked by Matt Lauer if they would get back into a plane again after their miraculous escape, all nine put up their hands with one women admitting she is more afraid of spiders

Amy Olson, left, remembers the pilot screaming at them to 'Go!', ordering them to jump. 'That's probably the worst, was hearing him scream,' she said through tears. 'It's pretty raw.'

When he saw the other pilot safely land his plane and then each skydiver parachute to the ground unhurt, he called it a miracle.

One of the skydivers Barry Sinnex 
told Matt Lauer on the Today show this week that he tried to chase 
Fandler's plane that was on fire as he was free-falling to see if the 
pilot was OK.

When he saw him jump from the plane, he chased him to make sure he could open his chute.

'Everybody
 else had parachutes on, so they were kind of on their own, so I chased 
the plane. I think Dan did too, he came down with me,' he said.

'We
 chased the airplane to see if the pilot got out. Once I saw the pilot 
bail out, I made sure he was going to open the parachute because he was a
 student.'

Daniel Chandler, who became wedged in between the two planes and almost collided with the propeller said: 'It was unpleasant. I had no time to react....The sound 
behind me, I'll never forget.

'And that's all I could do was try and stay
 forward and try not to move because I knew I was going to live where I 
was, or thought I could.'

Blake Weldan, who managed to fly one of the planes to safety and land perfectly at Richard I. Bong Airport in Douglas County, joked that it was one of his better landings and said he has no idea how the crash occurred.

'Everything was as it should have been,' he said.

'We were just kind of lucky that we were at the point where we were out of the airplane,' said 64-year-old flight instructor Mike Robinson, who was in the lead plane.

'If we'd been back in the rear of the airplane when they collided it might have been a little bit different.'

Once out of the plane, the skydivers had to carefully maneuver their chutes to stay out of the path of raining debris.

'We're
 in free fall, so we're falling about 120 miles miles an hour vertically
 down,' Mr Robinson said. 'But then we open our parachutes, and now all 
of a sudden they're falling faster than we are...Fortunately, everybody 
kept it together so they just avoided (the debris).'

Miraculously, no one on the ground was injured by the falling wreckage - but plenty saw them crash to the ground.

The Federal Aviation Administration will investigate the crash.

It's
 still uncertain what will happen to the skydiving company, since they 
only owned the two planes. But it is the end of their season anyway.

Mr
 Robinson says the crash yesterday happened during the fourth jump of 
his day, and that he's done over 900 jumps in his lifetime.

'I'll remember this one more than most,' he said.
