Towering above the other models, Gwendoline Christie was helping Vivienne Westwood make a big impression at her Paris Fashion Week show yesterday.

The 6ft 3in Game Of Thrones star, who has talked about the taunts she once endured over her androgynous looks, stalked down the catwalk wearing a mannish grey suit, long dark coat and oversized top hat, later wearing a feminine draped dress.

As sword-wielding warrior Brienne of Tarth, she takes on men on their own terms, making her the ideal choice to showcase Westwood's celebration of cross-dressing. 

The collection saw a male 'bride' in a wedding gown, with actress Paz de la Huerta playing groom and exposing her bare chest in an open white jacket.

Westwood told attendees: 'Right now in London there is a demonstration called 'Time to Act' demanding action to stop climate change.

'I cannot be there in person but I've sent a message,' she said, urging British voters to back environmentally conscious lawmakers in May elections.
