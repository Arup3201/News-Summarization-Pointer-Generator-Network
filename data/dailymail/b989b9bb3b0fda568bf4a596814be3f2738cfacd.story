An American woman charged with premeditated murder in the death of her socialite mother on Indonesia's Bali island told a court on Wednesday that her boyfriend killed her mother in anger after she threatened to kill their unborn baby.

Heather Mack, 19, and her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, are being tried separately by Denpasar District Court.

The pair from Chicago, Illinos, are charged with murdering Sheila von Wiese-Mack last August at the St. Regis hotel on Bali and face possible death by firing squad if found guilty. 

Von Wiese-Mack's badly beaten body was found in a suitcase in the trunk of a taxi at the hotel.

Heather Mack, 19, told an Indonesian court on Wednesday that her boyfriend Tommy Schaefer, 21, killed Shelia von Wiese-Mack in anger after she threatened to kill their unborn baby 

In her first questioning in court on Wednesday, Mack, who is eight months' pregnant, said Schaefer beat her mother with a metal soup bowl after von Wiese-Mack made the threat in an argument. Von Wiese-Mack objected to their relationship.

'The blow was not so hard ... and my mother was still resisting,' Mack said. 'I asked Tommy to stop and then I ran into the bathroom.'

Mack said when she left the bathroom, she found Schaefer on the bed trying to give her artificial respiration.

'Tommy said my mother was not breathing,' she said. Mack said she also tried to revive her but it didn't work.

She said they panicked and thought about either calling the police or taking the body in a suitcase to the U.S. Consulate. She did not explain why they did not do either one.

'We panicked and didn't know what to do,' she said.

Mack answered 'no' when the judge asked whether she wished her mother dead.

Mack and Schaefer arrived in court, handcuffed together and wearing matching orange waistcoats.

The pair sat in court in front of evidence believed to be a suitcase they are accused of using to hide the body of Mack's 62-year-old mother.  

According to the indictment, Schaefer battered von Wiese-Mack with a fruit bowl handle in her room following an argument over the hotel bill.

It says Mack helped stuff her mother's body into the suitcase by sitting on it to enable Schaefer to close it.

The indictment says they then placed the suitcase in the trunk of a taxi and told the driver they were going to check out of the hotel and would return, but never did. 

Hotel security guards are said to have seen blood spots on the grey suitcase and the taxi driver went to the police, who then made the gruesome discovery.

The first witness to testify at Schaefer's trial, a bellboy named Arifin, said he saw the couple taking a suitcase on a baggage cart toward the lobby on August 12.

He said during proceedings in February that he asked them about the hotel bill, which according to a receptionist hadn't been paid, but Mack refused to respond.

'They asked me to call a taxi, but they refused when I offered to help put the bag into the taxi,' he said.

'They argued that the contents were fragile, and refused to be assisted.'

Arifin, who uses a single name, said he heard about the murder later from police.

The second witness was I Putu Adi Marta, a technician who examined the hotel's security videos on August 12.

'I was asked to check because a couple, a man and a woman, were said to have escaped without paying the hotel bill,' he said.

Marta said the video recordings showed that Schaefer and Mack used the emergency stairs several times to go between the third and sixth floors.

Mack and her mother were staying in a room on the third floor, while Schaefer was staying on the sixth floor.

'The man walked up and down from the third to the sixth floor, changed his shirt once and brought a white cloth,' he said.

'They also were shown bringing a large package from the third to the sixth floor.'

A police officer also testified that he was among five police who arrested the couple on August 13 at the Bali Wisata Hotel in the Kuta area, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) from the St. Regis hotel.

'First they refused to be taken without being accompanied by lawyers from their government,' I Made Ariyana said.

He said they also refused to talk or be photographed at the Kuta police station.

Schaefer did not object to any of the testimony.

Prosecutors said before visiting Bali, Mack had suggested that Schaefer hire someone for $50,000 to kill her mother, who objected to their relationship. 

Mack and her mother had arrived first in Bali and were staying in a room on the third floor of the hotel, while Schaefer arrived later and was staying on the sixth floor.
