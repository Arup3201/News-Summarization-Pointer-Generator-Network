Sacked or defected? Syria's Prime Minister Riyad Hijab is no longer in the top job

Syria's Prime Minister Riyad Hijab has been sacked amid rumours he had defected with his family to neighbouring nation Jordan.

The former agriculture minister was only handed his post by President Bashar Assad in June following a parliamentary election.

Authorities said the vote was a step towards political reform, but opponents dismissed the ballot as a sham.

Officials
said Omar Ghalawanji, who was previously a deputy prime minister, had 
today been appointed to lead a temporary caretaker government.

It came as this morning a bomb blast 
ripped through the third floor of the Syrian state television and radio 
building in Damascus - injuring at least three people.

Footage showed the latest explosion to
hit the Syrian capital destroyed walls, overturned desks, blew out 
cabinet doors and shattered glass.

Workers were shown tending to a wounded colleague as the station managed to remain on air.

But,
despite the lack of deaths, the attack on the heavily fortified 
building has been described as a 'symbolic blow' in the 17-month 
uprising against Assad's regime.

Hijab's 'dismissal' also came as 
government forces appeared to prepare a ground assault to clear battered
rebels from Aleppo, the country's biggest city.

And it saw troops backed by fighter jets kept up an offensive against the last rebel bastion in the capital.

Rebels in districts of Aleppo seemed battered, overwhelmed and running low on ammunition after days of intense tank shelling and helicopter gunships strafing their positions with heavy machinegun fire.

Emboldened by an audacious bomb attack in Damascus that killed four of Assad's top security officials last month, the rebels had tried to overrun the Damascus and Aleppo, the country's commercial hub.

Reuters News said one of its Twitter accounts was hacked on Sunday and false tweets were posted, mainly related to the current armed struggle in Syria.

A spokesman said: 'Earlier today @ReutersTech was hacked and changed to @ReutersME.

'The account has been suspended and is currently under investigation.'

The incident follows the company's disclosure that the blogging platform of the Reuters News website was compromised on Friday.

It came when a fake post purporting to carry an interview with a Syrian rebel leader was illegally uploaded on a Reuters' journalist's blog.

In the latest incident a series of 22 false tweets were sent purporting to be from Reuters News.

Some of the tweets also carried false reports about Syrian rebel losses suffered in battles with Syrian government forces.

Thomson Reuters had no immediate information on who was behind the hacking.

Twitter could not be immediately reached for comment.

But the lightly armed rebels have been outgunned by the Syrian army's superior weaponry.

They were largely driven out of Damascus and are struggling to hold on to territorial gains made in Aleppo, a city of 2.5million.

Damascus has criticised Gulf Arab states and Turkey for calling for the rebels to be armed, and state TV has described the rebels as a 'Turkish-Gulf militia', saying dead Turkish and Afghan fighters had been found in Aleppo.

Paralysis in the UN Security Council over how to stop the bloodshed forced peace envoy Kofi Annan to resign last week, his ceasefire plan a distant memory.

The violence has already shown elements of a proxy war between Sunni and Shi'ite Islam which could spill beyond Syria's border.

The rebels claimed responsibility for capturing 48 Iranians in Syria, forcing Tehran to call on Turkey and Qatar - major supporters of the rebels - to help secure their release.

Today, Syrian army tanks shelled alleyways in Aleppo where rebels sought cover a helicopter gunship fired heavy machinegun fire.

Snipers ran on rooftops targeting rebels, and one of them shot at a rebel car filled with bombs, setting the vehicle on fire.

Women and children fled the city, some crammed in the back of pickup trucks, while others walked on foot, heading to relatively safer rural areas.

The main focus of fighting in Aleppo has been the Salaheddine district, a gateway into the city. One shell hit a building next to the Reuters reporting team, pouring rubble on to the street and sending billows of smoke and dust into the sky.

State television said Assad's forces were 'cleansing the terrorist filth' from the country, which has been sucked into an increasingly sectarian conflict that has killed about 18,000 people and could spill into neighbouring states.

The army appeared to be using a similar strategy in Aleppo to the one used in other cities where they subjected opposition districts to heavy bombardment for days, weakening the rebels before moving in on the ground, clearing district by district.

Syria's two main cities had been relatively free of violence until last month when fighters poured into them, transforming the war.

The government largely repelled the assault on Damascus but has had more difficulty recapturing Aleppo.

Rebel commanders say they anticipate a major Syrian army offensive in Aleppo and one fighter said they had already had to pull back from some streets after army snipers advanced on Saturday under cover of the fierce aerial and tank bombardment.

'The Syrian army is penetrating our lines,' said Mohammad Salifi, a 35-year-old former government employee.

'So we were forced to strategically retreat until the shelling ends,' he said, adding the rebels were trying to push the army back again.

Late last night rebels clashed with the army in Aleppo's south-eastern Nayrab district, a fighter who called himself Abu Jumaa said.

The army responded by shelling eastern districts. There were also clashes on the southern ring road, which could be a sign the army was preparing to surround the city.

Once a busy shopping and restaurant district where residents would spend evenings with their families, Salaheddine is now white with dust, broken concrete and rubble.

Tank shell holes gape wide on the top of buildings near the front line, and homes of families and couples have been turned into look-outs and sniper locations for rebel fighters.

Large mounds of concrete are being used as barriers to close off streets, as lamp posts lie horizontally across the road after being downed by shelling.
