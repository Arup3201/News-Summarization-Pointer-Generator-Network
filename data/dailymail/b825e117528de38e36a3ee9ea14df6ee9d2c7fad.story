Michael Cinatar, 20, pleaded guilty to a firearm offence after he shot a rifle at a friend in a dare gone wrong

A man who injured his friend after asking the victim's teenage son 'Do you want to see your dad being shot?' has pleaded guilty to a firearm offence.

Michael Ciantar, 20, pleaded guilty in the Adelaide magistrates court on Wednesday to discharging a firearm to injure, annoy or frighten.

Ciantar was arrested after a 41-year-old man arrived at hospital with a gunshot wound to his arm.

The incident occurred in the north Adelaide suburb of Brahma Lodge on February 27.

Prosecutors withdrew a more serious charge of aggravated causing serious harm to another.

Police previously said the man had stood against a wall and allowed himself to be shot with an air rifle.

The victim initially reported he had been injured in a drive-by shooting but later admitted it was the result of a dare.

Before he fired the rifle, Ciantar had asked the victim's teenage son whether he wanted to see his father shot.

He will face a sentence hearing on July 4.
