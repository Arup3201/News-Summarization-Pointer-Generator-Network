Mother-of-two: Jodie Emery (pictured outside Preston Crown Court) allegedly had her front door broken down at home in Lancashire

A jilted lover sent his ex-girlfriend a threatening text message before breaking down her front door three minutes later and stabbing her friend in a jealous rage, a court has heard.

Jason Taylor, 21, was allegedly convinced Jodie Emery, 26, was dating another man, telling her: ‘Last chance otherwise things are going to turn sour, tell me who is there.’

Then he suddenly broke down the mother-of-two’s front door at her home in Preston, Lancashire - and, armed with a knife, began grappling with Adam Wilson, 25, who had been invited round for drinks, the court was told.

Miss Emery - whose two young daughters were asleep upstairs - allegedly tried to stand between the pair in a bid to split them up, but Mr Wilson was left with a fatal thigh wound.

The victim - who was barely known to meat factory worker Taylor - was taken to hospital but bled to death before doctors could save him.

Preston Crown Court heard yesterday that the incident occurred on September 22 last year at 11pm - just two weeks after Taylor had split with Miss Emery after an eight-month relationship.

The couple had earlier been on a summer caravan holiday in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, but on their return Taylor was said to have become upset when he discovered Miss Emery had terminated a pregnancy.

Two days before the killing Taylor was at a local pub where he allegedly became so convinced Miss Emery was seeing someone else that he smashed a window and tried to punch a man who had once dated her.

He was also constantly texting and phoning Miss Emery and would go to her house and sit outside watching what was going on inside - and sometimes even look through the windows, the court was told.

Louise Blackwell QC, prosecuting, said on the day of the killing Taylor texted Miss Emery to say: ‘I miss you. Maybe in time you’ll want to try again’.

She asked him not to contact her, but later that evening he sent her another text saying: ‘Can I come for cuddles?’

Miss Emery responded: ‘you being weird then’ but he said: ‘I’m not, my head is just f*****’ and he allegedly rang his mother asking for a knife he bought during a previous holiday with Miss Emery.

The court heard he was spotted cycling towards her home during which he sent her another text asking her who she was with. She was said to have texted back: ‘On my own - I keep telling you’.

But Taylor then allegedly said: ‘Last chance otherwise things are going to turn sour, tell me who is there, last chance’. Emery replied ‘WTF’, and tried to call him three times with no response.

Miss Blackwell added: ‘The defendant then arrived at the front door and used considerable force to kick his way through the bottom panel. Once inside the incident starts immediately in the hall between the defendant and Adam Wilson and spilled into the lounge.

‘Miss Emery was trying her best, obviously unsuccessfully to break apart and stop the defendant being able to get at Adam Wilson but it did not stop.

‘All three of them ended up on the sofa in the living room. Adam Wilson was on the bottom, Jodie had got herself between him and the defendant lay on top but she described the repeated blows being struck to Adam Wilson.

‘She did not initially realise there was a knife involved but after a period of time during which blows were being rained down, the defendant then stood up.

'At that stage she saw he was armed with that knife, a knife she had seen before which he has bought when they were on holiday in Scarborough.’

Taylor allegedly fled the scene and dumped the knife as Miss Emery rang for ambulance.

Mr Wilson was pronounced dead in hospital just an hour later from the 6cm (2.3in) long and 7.5cm (3in)-deep fatal wound which was to the inner right thigh. There were also cut wounds to the back, buttocks and legs and abrasions that were consistent with a struggle, the court heard.

When Taylor was arrested he allegedly said: ‘No, you are not serious are you? You are joking, he is dead? He attacked me - I have done nothing wrong’.

The black-handled blood stained knife was later recovered and Taylor said he kept it for ‘his own protection’ because he had been threatened in the past.

He was said to have told police he had gone to speak to Miss Emery because of the breakdown of the relationship and had ‘no idea’ that Mr Wilson was there.

He claimed he was hit with a bottle and used the knife to defend himself.

In a video interview Miss Emery said Mr Wilson was ‘just a friend’ whom she had known for a couple of months. 

She said Taylor would turn up at her home and she believed he would carry on turning up if she did not reply to his messages. She claimed she was so fed up with her ex-boyfriend she invited Mr Wilson around to her home for a drinks and watch TV.

She added: ‘Jason had been constantly texting all the time. I made sure I was answering and replying to the phone calls. I didn’t tell him that I was with anyone because I knew he would not like that.

‘I said “I wasn’t with anyone, I wasn’t drinking - I was going to bed”. He was saying “are you with someone” - things along those lines. I was on the phone saying you are being weird with me I know you are drunk he said “tell me who you are with”.

She looked out of her front window and ‘got a feeling’ he might be watching and heard the door being kicked in, the court was told.

She said: ‘The bottom had caved in and he climbed through the hole. I’m not sure who threw the first punch but I have tried splitting them up.

‘I was shouting “my kids are upstairs. please stop”. At that point, Adam said “he stabbed me - ring 999”. I remember Jason swing the knife lower than the stab wound and that’s when I have seen the knife.

‘He was still stood with the knife in his hand. I said “the police are coming”, he said “you have grassed” and ran into the back garden.’

Taylor denies murder. The trial continues.
