The teenage girl who was rescued after being kidnapped by her close family friend that killed her mother and brother has broken her silence once more, fighting back at critics who accuse her of acting strangely in the wake of the tragedy.

Hannah Anderson has tried returning to her earlier life as 16-year-old California high school student, but the memory of her abduction and the lingering questions about her brother and mother's murders continue to creep their way into her daily conversations.

After being rescued by FBI agents in Idaho on August 10, Anderson made a semi-public re-entry to the world via social media, and after a month of silence, she has come back.

Smiling on the outside: Hannah Anderson has been regularly posting to her Instagram account since she was rescued on August 10 after her family friend Jim DiMaggio kidnapped her and killed her mother and brother

Memories: Hannah Anderson has posted pictures of her family on Instagram following her ordeal where her young brother and mother (right) were killed

She began answering questions from friends and strangers on social media site Ask.fm, and in some remarks the strain of the continued interest in the case is beginning to show.

When one woman asked Anderson why did she 'never run' away from her captor James DiMaggio- saying that 'he never have you handcuff or anything- Anderson snapped back.

'How do you know he never had me handcuffed? Because there you are wrong. Don't assume things you don't know. Just stop,' she wrote.

In another, a user accused her father of 'mooching off other people' and she responded: 'Why don't you shut the f*** up and get the facts right. He's trying a******. Why don't you get a life instead harassing people? (sic)'

Much loved: The teenage girl has posted many pictures of her late brother and mom who were killed by a family friend

Remembering the other victims: Hannah regularly posts old pictures of her mother Christina and brother Ethan, both of whom were killed by her captor before he fled with her to Idaho

Signs of trouble: She regularly posts inspirational messages hinting at her inner anguish

Though her re-emergence on Ask.fm came only four days ago, Anderson has been an active user on Instagram, regularly posting smiling selfies with friends to her nearly 9,000 followers.

There have been hints of emotional struggles, however, as she regularly posts old pictures of her mother Tina and brother Ethan, both of whom were tied, beaten and their bodies burnt.

'Just because i am strong enough to handle PAIN doesn't mean i deserve it [sic],' read one recent post.

Some of that pain is self-inflicted, as she admitted to reading the autopsy report about the deaths where the medical examiner detailed the way in which they were beaten before DiMaggio set the house on fire and drove off with Hannah.

She said that 'I need to know what happened to them'.

The question-and-answer style social media site is popular among teens but it has been gaining a larger audience as it has been cited in a number of cases of bullying that have resulted in suicides.

Happier moments: Anderson shared these pictures of herself and her boyfriend at their homecoming dance

Grieving: Hannah posted this picture with her brother Ethan and this message: 'Can't get you off my mind tonight. Miss you so much. I just wanna see you so bad. It's not the same and it never will be. I love you with all my heart'

Anderson's conversation shows that she is a target for such internet trolls as well, with a number taking issue with the smiling, cheery photos that she has posted in the days and weeks following the family tragedy. Another told her to 'stop editing your pics, it's not a good looks for you'.

Dead: FBI agents shot and killed Jim DiMaggio after they discovered him with Hannah in Idaho days after kidnapping her from California

'Sad that you don't even know me and run your mouth but I give you props for having balls to talk s*** over ask lol,' she responded.

Another talking point was the optics of how she walked into the memorial fundraiser for her mother and brother wearing short jean shorts and holding a cup from Starbucks.

'My friend randomly showed up with Starbucks and I guess she got me one,' Anderson wrote in one post, and continued by saying in another: 'Yeah it's stupid what was I suppose (sic) to do? Just throw it away when she gave it to me? People just find the littlest reasons to bash on me (sic).'

Her social media presence shows that in spite of days where she says it ‘just doesn’t feel real’, there have been some more light-hearted moments in her life of late.

Anderson attended her school’s 
homecoming dance in an embellished pink dress, and posted pictures of 
herself kissing her new boyfriend that she started dating a month ago.

Those
moments of teenage milestones hide the apparent pain that she continues
to go through, she says that she regularly breaks down in the evenings 
and uses her happiness during the day as a way to project a better 
image.

Adored: Hannah posted these pictures of her little brother Ethan with the words 'miss you' and 'my angel'

Watching her back: Anderson has faced critics online and at school, as many have raised questions about her behavior in the days and weeks following her return

Timing: Anderson said that the reason she had Starbucks at her mother and brother's funeral was because a friend got it for her. 'What was I suppose (sic) to do? Just throw it away when she gave it to me?'

‘I break down all the time. I don’t like crying I front of people [sic]. I’m the type of person that makes sure everyone else’s feelings are ohkay [sic] before I take care of mine. Sorry I don’t take pics of me crying? That makes me a bad person I guess,’ she wrote on Ask.fm.

DiMaggio was killed by the agents when they found he and Anderson in the woods of Idaho. He has been ruled as the sole suspect but questions arose when investigators found correspondence between he and the teen prior to the kidnapping.

San Diego Sheriff Bill Gore reiterated that in spite of the unexpected evidence, Anderson is ‘a victim in every sense of the word’.
