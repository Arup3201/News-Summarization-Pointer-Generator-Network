A 900-year-old Welsh village church is threatening to collapse after being devoured hundreds of seven millimetre-long deathwatch beetles.

Parishioners had to abandon their regular Christmas services at St Barrwg's Church, at Bedwas, near Caerphilly, South Wales, after it became infested with the notorious beetles.

The ancient church has to meet a £300,000 bill in order to save it from being completely destroyed by the deathwatch beetle invasion, and despite donations from the National Lottery, it still has a long way to go.

Holy mole-y: St Barrwg's Church at Bedwas, near Caerphilly, South Wales, has become infested with Deathwatch beetles

The Reverend Midge Moore said: ‘The problem is so extensive that the roof was considered to be in danger of collapse.

‘The church was immediately closed and scaffolding erected to support the roof until the work of restoration can be done.’

St Barrwg's has remained intact since it was built in 1102 in Bedwas.

But after surviving more than 900 years of turbulent history it has almost been destroyed by invading insects.

Biblical plague: The infestation has gotten so bad that the roof of the church is threatening to cave in

Terrible termites: Even though they only grow to be seven millimetre long (0.3in) the deathwatch beetle can do extensive damage

Big dinner: The church is now forced to pay £300,000 in repair bills after the full extent of the damage was discovered in the rafters

Rebuilding: Part of the payout has been med by the National Lottery, but there is still nearly £200,000 missing for the South Wales church

The first church-goers knew of the infestation was the tapping noise made by the beetles as they feasted on the ancient wood.

But church bosses realised just in time that the building was riddled with the tiny bugs.

They begged the Heritage Lottery Fund for help and were given a grant of £180,300 to save the historic building from collapse.

But repairs to the 12th century church - which retains many of its medieval features - could cost up to £300,000.

Cheeky bug-ger: Deathwatch beetles can destroy a whole home as they eat their way through wooden structures

Bet they were hungry: Further damage caused to a part of the church after the infestation

The tiny deathwatch beetle is just 7millimetres (0.3in) long, but can cause extensive damage to wooden structures.

t has gotten its name from the tapping noise it makes to attract a mate, which would be heard from inside the rafters of cabins and wooden buildings.

The quiet noise is associated with the 'death watch', or death vigil, kept beside the bed of a dying loved one, and old superstition see the beetle as an omen of impending death.
