But one chef has gone even further in making sure every last inch of the crustacean is put to use, after creating a collection of miniature motorbikes using its leftover shell.

Huang Mingbo from Taiwan, presented the collection at a food art seminar in the Chinese province of Fujian to the amazement of those in attendance.
