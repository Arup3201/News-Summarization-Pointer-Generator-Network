To the naked eye, it would seem wine only comes in three colours.

But astonishing new photographs have shown its true colours, after a scientist placed drops of the alcoholic drink under a microscope.

The magnified images show the rainbow coloured sugars found in various types of wine as well as the interesting shapes and patterns which are formed by its particles.

Among the tipples to be put under the microscope by Hawaii scientist, Dr Gary Greenberg, were Merlot, Beaujolais and Zinfandel.

Dr Greenberg uses the images to explore the true beauty of everyday items.

'The truly extraordinary nature of ordinary objects is revealed when seen through the lens of a microscope.

'Everyday objects take on a new reality when magnified hundreds or thousands of times, illuminating the hidden secrets of nature, and this is what I like to reveal with my work,' he said.Â

More than meets the eye: Most would be forgiven for thinking wine only comes in three shades

'There is an amazing micro world wrapped up inside the ordinary world that we experience through our senses,' he added.

At 33 Dr Greenberg left Los Angeles where he worked as a photographer and filmaker to complete a PhD in biomedical research at University College London.

In the 1990s he invented and developed high definition, three dimensional light microscopes which have helped develop his artistic side.

Dr Greenberg has devoted his career to exploring the hidden beauty of nature, photographing ordinary subjects at close range to expose their true appearance.

As well as wine, he has snapped various items of fruit and veg up close, and also completed a collection of pictures of flowers.

Among his best known work is his collection of pictures of grains of sand, for which he photographed moon sand returned from NASA'S Apollo 11 mission.

Dr Greenberg has also photographed a variety of parts of the body, including a human retina and a sequence of bone formation.

He describes his work as 'micro photography' which 'combines his passion for art and science by creating dramatic landscapes of hidden worlds.'
