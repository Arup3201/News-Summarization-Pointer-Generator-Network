His Hollywood family is worth nearly $500 million but the troubled homeless stepson of Barbra Streisand whiles away his days sitting on benches and rummaging through public trash cans.

Jess Brolin, son of actor James Brolin and brother to Josh, was recently photographed picking through garbage where he lives in Ojai, California.

After losing his $800 per month apartment in 2011, the 41-year-old now lives on the streets and sleeps in vacant lots not 80 miles from his millionaire showbiz family's home.

Whiling away: Brolin even spends some nights sleeping in empty lots

According to the Mirror, Brolin received a 6-figure inheritance in 1995 when his mother, James Brolin's animal activist ex-wife Jane Cameron Agee, died in a car accident.

He's since reportedly lived out of a truck before ending up obese and penniless on the Ojai streets.

'He will sometimes be sleeping in a field behind shops, basically ­wherever he can bed down,' a source close to Jess told the Mirror. 'It can be very cold at night as it's in the valley.'

The source said: 'It is a heartbreaking situation.

A spokesman for the Brolin family admitted they've done everything in their power to help Jess.

'We have offered help and support and we continue to do so,' the spokesman said. 'We love him very much and only want what is best for him.'
