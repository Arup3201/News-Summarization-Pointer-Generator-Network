The BBC has allegedly spent £12,000 on a sofa for one of its studios, a whistleblower has claimed.

The corporation reportedly footed the bill for a studio seat at the Points West regional newsroom studio in Bristol.

It comes as the BBC looks to slash its total budget by 20 per cent, saving £250 million.

A spokeswoman for the BBC declined to comment further on the purchase for "commercial and confidentiality reasons" but refused to dismiss it as untrue.

But Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'Licence fee payers will be rightly frustrated if the Beeb has shelled out so much for a new sofa.

'Taxpayers want their cash spent on quality programming, not lavish furniture.

'It's crucial that the BBC gets value for money as it's hard-pressed families footing the bill.'

The new sofa is said to be long enough to seat eight people and sits alongside the newsreaders' desk.

The previous sofa - said to seat only between two and three people - is over eight years old and has outlived two previous studio makeovers.

It has now been moved to the lobby area of the BBC building in Bristol's Whiteladies Road.

It is thought the new settee is designed to be long enough so a presenter can sit at one end with the interviewee at the other and enough space in between them for a TV projection.

BBC bosses claim the new furniture is part of a revamp of the Bristol studio - but insiders say no other renovations have been made yet.

A spokesperson said: 'We do not discuss studio equipment and programming costs, but we are always looking to give licence-fee payers the best value for money while ensuring wherever possible money goes into what is seen and delivered on-air.

'The BBC is on course to make £700m of savings annually by 2017.'

The Points West team has also come under fire for sending two reporters to South Africa to cover the extradition of honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani, pictured with wife Anni Dewani, from Bristol

When pushed for a denial or confirmation, a spokeswoman added: 'That is the response.

'We are not able to discuss production costs or programming costs for commercial reasons or confidentiality reasons.'

The corporation has come under fire for the apparently extravagant spend at a time when staff are being made redundant right across the state-funded programmer.

Three years ago the BBC announced it was cutting its budgets by 20 per cent - saving an estimated £250 million in the process - and making an estimated 2,000 staff redundant.

The local radio network bore the brunt of the cuts but Bristol also lost out on some programming as a result of the changes.

Meanwhile, the Points West team has also come under fire for sending two reporters to South Africa to cover the extradition of honeymoon murder suspect Shrien Dewani, from Bristol.

Andrew Plant and Jon Kay were sent to Cape Town as part of the BBC-wide coverage.

At the time, the rest of the BBC's South Africa news team were in Pretoria reporting on the Oscar Pistorius trial.

The BBC defended the move by saying such a major story was too much for one reporter to cover for all BBC outputs.
