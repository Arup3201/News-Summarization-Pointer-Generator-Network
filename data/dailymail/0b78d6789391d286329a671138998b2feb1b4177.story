Frank Lampard is getting used to life at a new club in a new city - dining out at Manchester's famous San Carlo restaurant with fiancee Christine Bleakley after his first training session on Wednesday.

The new Manchester City signing opted on a step up from room service at his Lowry Hotel residence with a meal at the celebrity haunt having met his team-mates for the first time earlier in the day.

Lampard has already admitted that moving to another Premier League club after 13 years at Chelsea feels 'very strange' - although he seems to be getting used to the move up north after taking in the city streets.

The England international will wear the No 18 shirt at the Etihad until January when he moves to New York City FC ahead of the MLS season.

'This is another little adventure for me,' Lampard said on Wednesday. 'I hope in the short space of time I can make an imprint and fit in at home at the training ground and do well here.

'Pushing yourself to come to a different place and fit in it's sort of character building. There's a lot for me to do here as a person and as a player and hopefully I can contribute on the pitch.'

And San Carlo also played host to another new Manchester resident - Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal, who enjoyed a night out with his wife.
