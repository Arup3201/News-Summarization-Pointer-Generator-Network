The United Nations needs to intervene to stop a Sudanese mother of two being executed for marrying a Christian, senior MPs from all parties have demanded today.

Pregnant mother Meriam Ibrahim, 27, was thrown in jail in September for converting from Islam to Christianity after marrying US citizen Daniel Wani. She was sentenced to  100 lashes and death for her 'crime'. 

Yesterday she gave birth to her baby girl Maya  - while still shackled to the floor at the Omdurman Federal Women’s Prison in North Khartoum where she has been locked up for eight months. 

The case has sparked global outrage and today, after shocking images of Meriam shortly after she gave birth were published on MailOnline, a host of MPs joined forces to demand action from the UN.

Labour's Douglas Alexander said the case was 'barbaric' and demanded the Government 'speak out firmly'

Labour’s Shadow Foreign Secretary, Douglas Alexander, told MailOnline: 'The plight of Meriam Ibrahim has outraged and shocked many people across the world. 

'The UK government must speak out firmly against her barbaric sentence and continue to call on the Sudanese government to revoke it.  

'Not only is her sentence abhorrent, but reports that she was shackled and restrained – even whilst giving birth, show that her treatment in detention, and the treatment of her young innocent children, has been both inhuman and cruel.

'The reports indicate that Meriam is being deliberately targeted and attacked because of her Christian faith. 

'It is vital that at these moments - when the world’s attention is focused on such victims of persecution - politicians are not afraid to speak up and speak out against such attacks on innocent people because of their religious beliefs.'  

Veteran Lib Dem foreign affairs expert Sir Ming Campbell added that the Government now needed to raise the case at the UN.

The former Lib Dem leader, who sits on the respected Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee, said: 'This is an act of barbarity and should be universally condemned - not least because it is wholly contrary to United Nations conventions on human rights.

Former Lib Dem leader Sir Ming Campbell said it was time for the UN to act to help Meriam Ibrahim

'What we should be doing is making the strongest representations possible and raise it at the UN in New York.'

Labour's Mike Gapes, a fellow member of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, added: 'It is absolutely disgraceful.

'It is another appalling example of the religious intollerance that that world needs to confront much more strongly.

'It is barbaric. It disregards all the values and human rights of the last 50, 60 years. It disregards her human rights, her children and he right to choose her religion and her partner.

'We have got to work with the EU and with other countries - the whole International Community - to condemn this.'

Mr Gapes also urged other Muslim countries to speak out. He said: 'We've got to get the Muslim and Arab world to speak out. But there are countries that share these awful reactionary attitudes.'

Tory MP Priti Patel added: 'This case just shows an awful, awful disregard for human life.

'I think as much pressure should be laid on the Sudanese Government to stop this from happening. They should be universally condemned.

'They should allow this lady to carry on living her life and respect her rights. It shows blatent disregard for her rights, her children's right, her right to choose her own religion and her right to choose who she marries.'

Tory MP Penny Mordaunt added: 'No person should face torture or death for their religious beliefs. Meriam Yehya Ibrahim has committed no crime, and she deserves her freedom and her dignity.

'My heart goes out to this brave young mum and her family. The international community should do everything in their power to press the Sudanese government to secure her release immediately and stop her execution.'

Fellow Tory MP Henry Smith said: 'The pain and humiliation that this mother has endured for the "crime" of being a Christian is unimaginable and has shocked communities across the world to their core.

'We should stop at nothing to make sure that the Sudanese authorities know that Mrs Ibrahim’s treatment is unacceptable, and should demand that she is released – unharmed – as a matter of urgency.'
