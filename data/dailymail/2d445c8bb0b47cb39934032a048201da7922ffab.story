Americans are among the most satisfied people in the world - possibly in part due to their higher-than-average annual incomes, according to an OECD study released Tuesday.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development used answers from a Gallup World Poll of some 1,000 responders in each of over 30 industrialized and developing economies, asking them to rate life satisfaction from 0 to 10.

Compared with other OECD countries, the U.S. excelled in many of the 11 criteria that the OECD considers as essential to a good life, including income and wealth; jobs and earnings; housing conditions and governance.

Life is good: The U.S. excelled in many of the 11 criteria that the OECD considers as essential to a good life, including income and wealth; jobs and earnings; housing conditions and governance

According to the survey, the U.S. ranked at the top in housing, income and wealth and above the OECD average in the dimensions of health status, jobs and earnings, subjective well-being, personal security, environmental quality, civic engagement and education and skills.

In the U.S., people earn $54,450 a year on average, much more than the OECD average of $34,466 and the highest rate across the OECD. But there is a substantial gap between the richest 
and poorest, with the top 20 per cent of the population earning eight 
times as much as the bottom 20 per cent.

But the country was in the bottom 20 per cent in categories of work-life balance and social connections.

When asked to rate their general satisfaction with life on a scale from 0 to 10, people in the U.S. gave it a 7.0 grade, higher than the OECD average of 6.6. For comparison, Residents in the U.K. rated their life satisfaction at 6.8.

Along with the U.S., Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland dominated the index in terms of a general sense of well-being.

On the other end of the spectrum, Chile, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Mexico, Portugal and Turkey had the lowest scores.

Land of opportunity: In the U.S., the average household net-adjusted disposable income is $38,001 a year, more than the OECD average of $23,047

It found life satisfaction scores dropped by more than 20 per cent in Greece over the five years to 2012, while Spain saw a fall of 12 per cent and Italy a drop of 10 per cent.

The largest impact of the global economic crisis on Americans' well-being has come through higher unemployment, which increased by nearly 2 per cent compared to employment rate, which plunged more than 4 per cent between 2007 and 2012.

During the same time period, the percentage of Americans describing themselves as very satisfied with their lives dropped from 78 per cent to 67 per cent.

‘People feel like the government is 
unable to help them get out of the crisis,’ OECD chief statistician 
Martine Durand told Reuters.

The
 crisis has not only eroded confidence in public institutions in 
countries worst-hit by the financial crisis but across the 
developed-economy countries of the OECD organisation as a whole, the 
study found.

Only 40 per cent of people questioned for the report had trust in their government, the lowest level since 2006.

The
 report, which covered the 34 OECD countries as well as Brazil and 
Russia, is part of an OECD drive to go beyond traditional economic 
measures such as gross domestic product by looking at indicators on 
things such as education, work-life balance and civic engagement.

People
 in the U.S. work 1,787 hours a year, more than the OECD average of 
1,776 hours, earning the country a low work-life balance rank.

The
 U.S. is also lagging behind in safety. According to the survey, 
American homicide rate stands at 4.8, compared to the OECD average of 
2.2.

In terms of education, nearly 90 per cent of Americans between the ages of 25 and 64 have earned the equivalent of a high school diploma, which is above average.

But U.S. students' scores in reading, math and sciences falls just under the OECD average.
