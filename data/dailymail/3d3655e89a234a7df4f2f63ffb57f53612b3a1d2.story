If you are so overworked you feel as though you may as well start sleeping in the office, the answer is finally here.

The bizarre, jigsaw-style Verbandkammer offers a space to eat, sleep and work - all in one sci-fi style, multi-sectioned pod.

It was custom-built at the request of the FLACC workplace for visual artists in Genk, Belgium.

Ready for take-off: The amazing Verbandkammer looks like a futuristic spaceship

Layers of history: London and Berlin-based architects Nilsson Pflugfelder were inspired by a lump of coal for the office shape and concept

Ingenious use of space: The installation has 40 modules that can be rearranged into work desks, meeting areas, archive shelving and sleeping quarters

The work and living space contains 40 modules that can be rearranged to provide desks, meeting areas, tiered seating, platforms, shelving and even pull-out beds - should you have time to snatch a power-nap.

The strange creation looks like a sleeper train, nuclear bunker or even Batman's new cave.

'Verbandkammer is designed to grow and shift with your needs, with the pieces fitting together like a giant puzzle,' say its makers Nilsson Pflugfelder.

They claim the igloo-shaped design will allow visual artists and other office workers to 'operate in a more critical and self-reflective way'.

Customised quarters: The Verbandkammer comes with adaptable pull-out beds and tiered seating that fit together 'like a giant puzzle'

Inside and out: The igloo-style bunker has plenty of space for storage, making it perfect for the workaholic

Complex archive: The designers liken their creation to a piece of coal because of its layers and history

The Verbandkammer, or 'combined chamber' includes 11 frames and 10 types of cladding and can even be taken on the road, as it can be disassembled in just minutes.

Its designers compare the strange installation to a piece of coal - an object with a history of sedimentation, layering, compression and fossilisation.

Unlike a lump of coal, however, the Verbandkammer is a sustainable space in which things can be both retrieved and produced.

Heads down: The pod is perfect for when you want a brief slumber while working on a major project
