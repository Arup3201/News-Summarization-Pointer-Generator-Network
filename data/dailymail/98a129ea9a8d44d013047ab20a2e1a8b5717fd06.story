Chelsea will storm to Premier League glory by five points, Arsenal and Manchester United will qualify for the Champions League but Tottenham and Liverpool will miss out.

That's according to the calculations of BSports, a division of STATS, whose computers have simulated each of the season's remaining games 100,000 times to predict the final table in May.

They predict Chelsea will preserve their current five-point advantage at the summit and finish on 87 points, ahead of nearest-challengers Manchester City.

Chelsea will still be celebrating at the end of the season, according to BSports' simulation of the title run-in

Manchester City will finish five points behind Chelsea in the table, according to the predictions

Arsenal will continue their climb up the table to claim third place behind Chelsea and Manchester City

Arsenal will continue their recent upturn in form and surge up the table to finish third, some nine points behind City but two ahead of United.

Louis van Gaal's team will fulfil the manager's objective of returning to Europe's foremost competition and in some comfort, finishing five points ahead of Spurs.

But, according to the BSports projection, Spurs will again have to settle for the Europa League and Liverpool will also miss out on the top four.

They also predict that Southampton's European challenge will fade away and they will drop to a final position of seventh, just one place but quite a few points ahead of the season's other surprise package West Ham.

BSports have also calculated each side's chances of finishing in those all important top four places.

Chelsea have a 100 per cent chance of making it, while City are 99.8 per cent certain. Arsenal are given an 83.2 per cent of finishing in the Champions League spots, while United are rated at having a 73.9 per cent chance. 

Manchester United will make their return to Champions League football by finishing fourth in the table 

Tottenham will just miss out on the top four and will have to settle for the Europa League once again

Liverpool will finish down in sixth according to the BSport projection, missing out on the Champions League

Southampton will slip down the table from their current position of fourth to finish in seventh

West Ham's chances of breaking into the top four have faded

Analysing the title run-in, the relative strengths of the squads and the current five-point margin, they say Chelsea have a 77.7 per cent probability of winning the title.

The exciting title race continues this weekend with Chelsea travelling to goal-shy Aston Villa and Man City at home to Hull City.

Man United head to West Ham on Sunday afternoon while there are two local derbies - in north London between Tottenham and Arsenal, and Merseyside between Everton and Liverpool.

BSports take into account all kinds of different factors when working out their predictions from form and league record to squad strength and upcoming fixtures.

Each fixture is run through their systems 100,000 times, a sample size large enough to eliminate most ambiguities.

It now remains to be seen whether the Premier League top-four race turns out as predicted here.
