On the mean streets of Glasgow's Barrowfield a young man has two choices: make something of your life or... well, the other option isn't worth thinking about.

An area renowned for gang warfare, drugs and crime, it has undergone a revamp in recent years but there is no escaping you need to be hewn from stern stuff to survive.

James McArthur took the first option yet recognises the role Barrowfield played in shaping the man he is today.

'Where I grew up it was a rough area but it's something I would never change,' says the Crystal Palace midfielder. 'It made me what I am. Every day was an education.'

McArthur was one of many football-daft kids who played the game on the streets or on the red ash pitches in the shadow of Celtic's old training ground. They took on other streets, against boys and men of all shapes and pedigree.

'We had 22 kids or whoever playing against each other on whatever pitch we could find. It's not something you see too much of now and I think kids today are missing out. It was where we all came together and it taught me a lot. It toughened me up and made me sharper.'

Temptation of a different life was never far away though. His friends boasted of great nights out drinking at 15 and 16 while McArthur confesses he once got involved in a gangfight but fear of his father's reaction meant once was more than enough.

'My mum and dad always kept at me about keeping to the right path and not getting involved. My dad James drove me up and down the country so that I could play my football and it's one thing I never forgot.

'As soon as I was able to help my family I did.'

However Barrowfield is painted, it certainly provided motivation; McArthur's boyhood friends Graham Dorrans and Robert Snodgrass also went on to make professional careers and the values learned on their housing estate remain.

McArthur was a late substitute in Scotland's win over Georgia on Saturday and is keen to play a greater role against Poland on Tuesday night. He won't be rushing to swap shirts with Robert Lewandowski and Co though.

McArthur was one of Scotland's star turns in their bold performance against Germany last month but defeat meant the 27-year-old wasn't in the mood for mementoes from any of their World Cup winners.

'I didn't go looking to swap shirts with anyone,' he says. 'You see it all the time now but what message does that send out to the fans? We lost the game.

'If I was a fan I wouldn't be happy seeing players running to swap shirts with a team they'd lost to. You want to play against those players, the best in the world, but I was more bothered by our result. It was a good performance but we were upset not to get something from it. I don't want a shirt to remind me of defeat.'

McArthur, who names former Rangers and Scotland captain Barry Ferguson as one of his boyhood heroes, is confident Scotland can progress from what is a tricky group.

'We have a good group of players and we firmly believe we can qualify if we play to our potential.'

Progress could be at the expense of his close friend James McCarthy the Republic of Ireland and Everton midfielder who played alongside McArthur at Hamilton Academicals before both moved to Wigan Athletic where they won the FA Cup but also got relegated; 'the highest and lowest points of my career and within a week of each other'.

The two were often confused by commentators due to the similarities in their name and the matter was compounded when singer James Arthur won the TV show X Factor. 'I think my twitter following multiplied until they realised their mistake,' he jokes.

McArthur and McCarthy faced each other as opponents for the first time shortly after McArthur's £7m summer transfer and it was Palace who came out victorious.

'We exchanged a few texts in the build-up, a few jokes, all good natured banter, but during the game I didn't get the chance to say anything as he ended up playing right-back. He's a terrific player though. 

'He moans a lot but he's taking his game to another level now and he's going to be one of the best in the Premier League.'

McArthur's transfer to Crystal Palace wasn't the only major change in his life last summer. Resplendent in kilt, he married long-time girlfriend Louisa, mother of their baby daughter Ella Rose, at the luxurious Cameron House hotel on Loch Lomond.

The family, complete with pet puggle dog Dexter, a pug and beagle cross before you ask, moved to London in August and are already settled.

'I was sad to leave Wigan because there were so many good people there. Leicester came close to signing me too but Palace agreed the terms and I knew it was the best move for my career and my family.

'We've adjusted pretty well already. We were in a hotel for a few days but we quickly got a house and that's made a huge difference.'

POLAND (probable, 4-4-2): Szczesny; Piszczek, Glik, Szukala, Wawrzyniak; Rybus, Krychowiak, Mila, Grosicki; Milik, Lewandowski.

SCOTLAND (probable, 4-2-3-1): Marshall; Hutton, Martin, Greer, Robertson; Brown, D Fletcher; Morrison, Naismith, Maloney; S Fletcher.

Referee: Alberto Undiano Mallenco (Spa).

Any upheaval has been helped by the presence of friend and fellow golf buff Barry Bannan while manager Neil Warnock has been quick to make him feel at home.

'He's a character,' says McArthur. 'I'm grateful to him for bringing me back to the Premier League and he's been excellent with me. He's obviously a passionate guy, you can see that on the touchline but he's always got a smile.

'He's very organised as a manager and he's always chirpy around the place, cracking jokes. He wants his team to win but I've not seen him going over the top, not yet anyway.'

It seems the young James McArthur from Barrowfield has made all the right choices.
