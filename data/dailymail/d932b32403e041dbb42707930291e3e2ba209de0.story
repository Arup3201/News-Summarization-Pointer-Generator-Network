Time is running out to persuade the public of the benefits of fracking, David Cameron was warned last night.

As MPs complained that plans to incentivise communities with a share of the profits of shale gas ‘do not go far enough’, the Prime Minister yesterday pledged that Britain would go ‘all out’ for shale gas.

But in a stark warning, every MP in Lancashire and council leaders in the North West have written a joint letter to warn Mr Cameron that ‘opposition is hardening’ to fracking.

The PM insisted the government was going 'all out for shale gas' but critics said incentives were too low

All Mr Cameron's incentives were branded as 'bribes' by environmental campaigners today

The MPs, led by Ben Wallace, a 
ministerial aide to Ken Clarke, say they will not back shale gas 
exploration unless the Government gives communities more money.

And
 they warn Mr Cameron he will be throwing away a ‘once-in-a-generation 
opportunity’ to close the North-South divide unless he acts now.

Crucially,
 the letter has also been signed by five council leaders, who are in 
charge of deciding whether to allow fracking in their areas. Plans 
outlined by the Prime Minister yesterday mean local councils can pocket 
100 per cent of the business rates collected from fracking firms – 
double the previous amount – plus £100,000 for every well drilled.

Protections will ensure fracking will only go ahead if environmental dangers can be avoided, Mr Cameron said

But
 local communities will get only 1 per cent of the total profits from 
shale gas exploration – compared with the 10 per cent demanded by the 
Local Government Association (LGA), while the Government will pocket 62 
per cent in taxes.

Mr 
Cameron, who yesterday toured a drilling site near Gainsborough, 
Lancashire, said: ‘We’re going all out for shale. It is important for 
our country, it could bring 74,000 jobs, over £3billion in investment, 
give us cheaper energy for the future, and increase our energy security.
 I want us to get on board.’

But Sir Merrick Cockell, chairman of the LGA, dismissed the proposed community contributions as a  ‘token offer’.

He
 said: ‘This is not happening in the North Sea. This is happening in and
 around local people and local communities, and they have got to get  
their fair share.’

But 
Lawrence Carter, of Greenpeace, said: ‘This is a naked attempt by the 
Government to bribe hard-pressed councils into accepting fracking in 
their area.’

Meanwhile, protests continued last night at the site of a shale gas well near Manchester.

For
 nearly two months, campaigners have tried to stop drilling at Barton 
Moss, where an exploratory well is being sunk beside the M62.

Yesterday
 six campaigners were arrested for obstruction, bringing the total 
number of arrests to more than 50. The cost of the policing operation so
 far is more than £330,000.
