An Indiana pound dog is now on the road to recovery after his baffled caregivers finally discovered what was making his hair fall out and skin pitifully inflamed: he's allergic to humans.

Adam, a black lab, showed up to Lucky Dog Retreat Rescue in Indianapolis back in June. Caregivers there hoped a healthy diet, baths and some much-needed love would allow his hair to grow back and cracked skin to heal.

When none of it worked, a blood test revealed Adam's surprising diagnosis.

Poor pooch: Adam, a rescued black Lab in Indianapolis, was found blistered and balding with wounds where he'd bitten and scratched at his body because of unbearable itching

Nothing worked: Adam was given baths, fed the best food and given extra love and attention but the terribly inflamed skin just wasn't improving the way his caregivers had hoped

'Humans. I didn't believe her at first,' Robin Herman, who rescued Adam, said of the veterinarian's verdict. 'I thought she was kidding.'

Just as humans can be allergic to dogs, they can apparently be allergic to us, Herman learned.

More specifically, Adam is allergic to human dander--the minute particles we constantly shed from our skin and scalp.

The intolerance was inflaming Adam's skin and driving him to scratch and bite at his rapidly balding body constantly.

Shocking diagnosis: A blood test eventually revealed the problem--Adam is allergic to humans

When the itching was at its worst, the folks at Lucky Dog Retreat were forced to keep his head in a cone at all times.

To combat the problem, Herman found a vet who could whip up a serum for Adam just like the allergy shots so often given to humans.

And just as in people, the immunotherapy uses proteins of the allergen itself to slowly teach Adam's immune system to tolerate people.

'They just put a serum together, just like with kids' allergies and other dogs' allergies, and he starts on allergy shots this week,' Herman told KGO.

Improving: Being in the hands of kind animal lovers dedicated to making him better has already helped Adam improve

Allergy shots: A veterinarian has created a special serum that will hopefully encourage Adam's immune system to better tolerate human dander--then his rescuers intend to find him a good home
