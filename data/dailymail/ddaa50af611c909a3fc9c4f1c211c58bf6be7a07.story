Up to 99 per cent of Britons mix up the Biblical nativity story with common misconceptions about animals, stables and inns, a survey found today.

These include Mary travelling to Bethlehem on a donkey, Jesus being born on Christmas Day and three wise men visiting him - none of which are mentioned in the world’s most-read book.

Only 3 per cent of adults are aware that the Bible does not actually state the number of wise men who arrived to see Jesus - despite it often being portrayed as three, the Bible Society poll revealed.

Christmas myths: Up to 99 per cent of Britons cannot correctly recognise the Biblical nativity story from common misconceptions about animals, stables and inns, a shocking survey found today

Just 4 per cent know that the Bible does not say how Mary got to Bethlehem, and less than a third correctly said Mary and Joseph were betrothed when she found out she would give birth to Jesus.

Some 20 per cent were able to correctly say that Mary and Joseph travelled across the country after being told to do so by Caesar Augustus, with 5 per cent believing they were moving house.

And one in four say Jesus was born on December 25, although there is no reference to a date in the Bible. The date on which we celebrate Christmas comes from the Roman festival Saturnalia.

Meanwhile only 40 per cent of respondents could correctly state that the Bible says the angels told the shepherds: ‘Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will to all men.’

And just 1 per cent correctly identified that the Bible does not say Jesus was born in a stable. 

World's most-read book: One in four respondents to the survey carried out earlier this month said Jesus was born on December 25, although there is no reference to a date in the Bible

The society warned of a ‘growing decline in Bible literacy’ - adding that people aged at least 55 know the book's stories best, with the majority of correct answers being achieved by this age group.

Bible Society group chief executive James Catford said: ‘Nine out of ten people don’t engage with the Bible and they might not realise that they’re missing out on a treasure trove of brilliant and engaging stories.

‘The Bible could be lost to future generations unless we all take action. That’s why in the week leading up to Christmas and beyond, we are encouraging parents to save a little time in their annual celebrations to help pass on one of the greatest stories ever told.’

The society was founded in 1804 by a group of people including William Wilberforce to encourage the wider ‘circulation and use’ of the Scriptures.

The survey was carried out from December 3 to 5 by OnePoll among a sample size of 1,000 adults.
