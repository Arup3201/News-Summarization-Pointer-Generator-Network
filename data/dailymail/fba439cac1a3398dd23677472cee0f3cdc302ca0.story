An 'invisible hand' of social convention is behind the mysterious rise and fall in the popularity which names parents pick for their children, according to a new study.

While some had theorized that celebrity parents, or even the government, influence whether Jessica or Taylor is in for a given year, scientists have found evidence that a more subtle phenomenon is at work.

According to the academics behind the study, the process of subconsciously trying to fit in with everybody else in a social group always leads to clear winners - even though it is impossible to pick who they are.

Experiment: Scientists tested how trends emerged by asking subjects to name people in pictures they were shown, with a reward for choosing the same as somebody else. After a series of rounds, a set of most popular names emerged

Shifting tastes: The authors say their study disproves the notion that institutions or celebrities lead trends like baby naming - which instead happen by themselves

Scientists from the University of Pennsylvania and City University, London asked a group of people to pick names for a series of faces that flashed in front of them in an online game. 

Using small amounts of money, the players were rewarded for picking the same name as others in the group, and penalized for choosing a different one.

Each time the results were different, players of the so-called Name Game were shown what other users picked, helping to inform their next choice.

After several rounds of chaos, a few clear winners emerged, and a set of most popular names was born.

Damon Centola, one of the authors, explained the process to the Washington Post.

He said: 'In the very first few rounds, it was just utter failure and no one could match'

'But then you had a small, minor option that all of a sudden became explosively used by strangers - it just caught on like wildfire, and within a few rounds, was universally adopted.'

Larger groups of people required longer for a consensus to emerge - but the overall trend was the same, according to the study, which was published in the PNAS academic journal.

The trend appears to play out as explained on a much larger playing field. Baby names across all of the United States, compiled from birth records by the Social Security Administration, follow

Andrea Baronchelli, the co-author of the study, described the phenomenon as 'spontaneous emergence'.

She said: 'Spontaneous emergence is like the existence of an invisible hand.

'Everybody is just trying to agree with their social circle, and spontaneously there will be the emergence of a single consensus.'

Though the theory of spontaneous emergence is not new, the study marks the first time scientists have tested it on a large group - in this case around 100 people. 

As well as the narrow field of baby naming, the findings could can be applied to a much wider array of social conventions, such as changes in language or style. 

Trends: The study helps explain why baby names change in popularity. Above are the top 20 baby names in the Untied States for three different years - 1990 (left), 2000 (center) and 2013 (right). While some names, like Elizabeth, feature in all three, many have dropped away after ten or twenty years
