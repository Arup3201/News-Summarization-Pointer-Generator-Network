Should Alan Pardew remain in charge of Newcastle?

The seriousness of Alan Pardew’s headbutt was highlighted by the FA when they declared that the offence was a ‘non-standard’ case for their disciplinary department.

Pardew has until 6pm on Thursday to respond to being charged for his astonishing attack on Hull City’s David Meyler.

Then, a three-man commission will be chosen to decide on a punishment that could extend to a lengthy  stadium ban as well as a fine.

Newcastle’s manager is not expected to appeal. He has already apologised and said he will accept whatever punishment he receives.

Newcastle
 United manager Alan Pardew has been charged in relation to an incident 
in his side’s game against Hull City on 1 March 2014.

It
 is alleged that in the 72nd minute of the fixture, Pardew was involved 
in an incident with a Hull City player that amounted to improper 
conduct.

Due to the serious violent and/or aggressive nature of the reported behaviour this case has been designated as non-standard.

Pardew has until 6pm on Thursday 6 March 2014 to respond to the charge.

This means that the FA will not need to call on an experienced and expensive QC to chair the commission.

An FA statement said: ‘Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew has been charged. It is alleged Pardew was involved in an incident with a Hull City player that amounted to improper conduct.

‘Due to the serious violent and/or aggressive nature of the reported behaviour, this case has been designated as non-standard.’

Pardew has already been fined £100,000 and issued with a formal warning by Newcastle, but his position could be reviewed by club owner Mike Ashley if the manager is hit with a stadium ban.

Pardew did at least discover that he had escaped criminal charges on Monday.

A Humberside police chief said Pardew’s conduct could have been deemed ‘offensive’, but added that no-one had requested that the matter be taken further.

Chief inspector Richard Kirven said: ‘Having reviewed the circumstances of the incident, it has been agreed that the matter will be dealt with by the FA, rather than considering criminal proceedings.

‘There has been no complaint received from either the player involved or Hull City. Humberside Police will not be taking any further action.’

We have been working with the FA and the football club to progress the matter appropriately.

Having
 reviewed the circumstances of the incident it has been agreed that the 
matter will be dealt with by the FA rather than considering any criminal
 proceedings.

There has been no complaint received from the player involved or Hull City Association Football Club at this time.

Whilst
 we appreciate that some people may have found the behaviour displayed 
at the game on Saturday offensive, Humberside Police will not be taking 
any further action.'

It was only recently that the club dismissed reserve-team coach Willie Donachie amid allegations that he struck a player, understood to be 19-year-old defender Remie Streete, and the pressure could mount on the club to be just as tough.

FA chairman Greg Dyke has already described it as a ‘serious’ issue while leading figures in the game have said Pardew’s position is ‘untenable’.

When the then Blackpool manager Paul Ince was punished for physically confronting the fourth official in the tunnel at Bournemouth earlier this season, he was hit with a five-game stadium ban.

A 10-game ban for Pardew would see 
him miss the rest of the season with matchday duties switching to 
assistants John Carver and Steve Stone, leaving Newcastle owner Mike 
Ashley looking at the long-term repercussions.

The
 controversial owner, who gave Pardew an eight-year deal last season, is
 understood to have acted swiftly on Saturday evening in an attempt to 
draw a line under the incident and end speculation that he intends to 
sack Pardew.

But Ashley
 holds a review of all aspects of the club at the end of every season 
and Pardew’s behaviour is certain to come under scrutiny despite him 
being almost certain to provide the top-half finish which was his target
 for this season.

Newcastle United are disappointed with the actions of its manager Alan Pardew this afternoon (Saturday, 1st March).

His behaviour was unacceptable and is not the behaviour we expect from the manager of Newcastle United.

It is most disappointing that this incident has taken the focus away from what was a fantastic performance by the team and an excellent result away from home which leaves the club in eighth place in the Barclays Premier League.

Sadly, the headlines tomorrow will not be focused on the result or the efforts of the players, but instead on the actions of our manager.

Alan unreservedly apologised immediately following the game to the player, to Hull City Football Club and its fans, and to the fans of Newcastle United.

We have held discussions this evening with Alan who has offered his sincere apologies to the Club and it is clear he deeply regrets his actions. Alan has accepted a formal warning from the Club in relation to his behaviour today and also a Club fine of £100,000.

The Club is now drawing a line under this matter and will be making no further comment.

The Newcastle manager fined himself last month for a foul-mouthed attack on Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini.

At the start of last season he pushed a linesman in the back and was involved in an ugly row with ex-Sunderland boss Martin O’Neill during the Tyne-Wear derby.

On Sunday even Richard Bevan, the chief executive of the League Managers’ Association, could not defend Pardew.

Bevan was keen to stress that the second longest-serving manager in the Premier League was ‘extremely sorry’, but having spoken to Pardew, he said: ‘The buck stops with Alan. It’s unacceptable, it’s inappropriate and it’s insupportable from every perspective.

Not happy: Arsene Wenger took issue with Pardew's celebrations as West Ham beat Arsenal 1-0 in 2006

Heated: Martin O'Neill took exception to Pardew's over-zealous celebrations in the 2011 Tyne-Wear derby

Frankly, I was shocked and disgusted by Pardew’s incredibly irresponsible action. And yet, and even more disturbingly, I wasn’t completely surprised. Pardew has a lot of previous, a lengthy list of touchline bust-ups and misbehaviour. 

When manager of Ipswich Town, I had personal experience of Pardew’s touchline impropriety during a play-off semi-final with his then club West Ham. I was alarmed, to say the least, by the way he tried to influence the officials.

'Alan knows that. He immediately realised
 the serious error, made sincere apologies to all parties. But Alan does
 need to think about how not to put himself in that position again.’

Pardew has said he would have to ‘sit down and stay out of the way’ rather than roam his technical area. Bevan nevertheless believes certain issues need to be addressed.

Bevan told Sportsmail: ‘We did a technical report last year. Now we are working on a second report. I don’t mention this now because of Alan but because it is an important project.

'There can be too much traffic in the technical areas and sometimes problems arise because of that.'

November 2006: Pardew had earlier in the year criticised Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger for failing to field an English player in the Champions League match against Real Madrid and matters came to a head in West Ham's 1-0 win over Arsenal. Then West Ham boss Pardew's enthusiastic celebrations appeared to irritate Wenger, who claimed he was 'provoked in a disrespectful way', with the pair having to be kept apart by the fourth official. On this occasion, it was the Gunners boss who was fined by the Football Association, with Pardew cleared of all charges.

March 2012: In a Tyne-Wear derby, it perhaps comes as no surprise that the tension boiled over, with Pardew, now Newcastle boss, clashing with Martin O'Neill following his celebration to Shola Ameobi's late equaliser in a heated match. Both managers pledged afterwards to keep their emotions in check in future.

August 2012: Pardew came under severe criticism and then afterwards labelled his behaviour 'ridiculous' when he shoved linesman Peter Kirkup in the Magpies' season opener against Tottenham after disagreeing with the official's decision to award Spurs a throw-in. Pardew once again apologised for his actions but the Football Association took a dim view and hit him with a two-match touchline ban and a £20,000 fine.

January 2014: Pardew became involved in another touchline row, less than a month after having heated words with Southampton boss Pochettino, with Manchester City manager Pellegrini. Television cameras clearly showed the Newcastle boss launching an expletive-laden volley at the Chilean. Pardew was spared punishment but said later: 'It was a heat of the moment thing, words we always have as managers, to a degree. I've apologised and I'm fortunate that he's accepted that.'
