Questions: Bernard Hogan-Howe, the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, will face questions tomorrow over why the information was shredded

A secret memo has revealed the shocking truth behind a ‘lorry load’ of anti-corruption files shredded by Scotland Yard.

A summary of the files says investigators gathered evidence of wholesale criminal behaviour by trusted police officers during an undercover three-year probe.The memo, written by Detective Superindent David Hurley, said corrupt officers:

But the so-called ‘lorry load’ of information which contained the findings – including documents, photographs and videos – was  mysteriously shredded during a two-day operation in 2003.

The extraordinary details in Mr Hurley’s internal ‘restricted’ briefing note – uncovered by QC Mark Ellison during his review into the Stephen Lawrence murder – ramp up the pressure on the Met to find out why a hoard of such sensitive and valuable material was destroyed.

Tomorrow, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe will be asked by MPs to explain why the goldmine of sensitive information was dumped.

No one at the force has come up with a convincing explanation for why the files were destroyed. It has merely said it has ‘little detail’ on what led up to the shredding.

Sir Bernard’s force already faces a potentially explosive inquiry into undercover policing that could yet draw together two of the darkest chapters in its modern history.

Dark chapters: Questions remain over whether a web of corrupt officers undermined investigations into the deaths of Stephen Lawrence, left, and Daniel Morgan, right

Questions remain over whether a web of corrupt  officers undermined the inquiries into the death of Stephen Lawrence and private eye  Daniel Morgan.

The vast majority of papers from the Met’s top secret Operation Othona, a multi-million-pound anti-corruption inquiry, cannot be found.

Some computer files relating to the Othona operation were found on a hard drive in a cardboard box in the Met’s professional standards department in November 2013.

But paper copies of the intelligence were missing. The Ellison review was told there had been a ‘mass shredding’ of them in 2003. 

Roy Clark, who lead anti-corruption at the time of Othona,  said: ‘I’d be shocked if it doesn’t exist. It was gold-dust stuff.’

The officer, who retired in 2001, added that it was important the information was used to keep up the pressure on corrupt officers. He said: ‘How you can go to those lengths and spend all that money and it is not there, I am just amazed.’

Fears: The shredded files may have contained crucial clues over alleged corruption

Stephen’s parents Doreen and Neville have long feared that corruption played a part in the years of police failings over his racist murder in 1993.

Gary Dobson and David Norris were convicted of his murder in 2012 and Sir Bernard has vowed to keep fighting to bring others to justice.

Potential link: Suspected 'bent' Met detective John Davidson, who was slammed in the Ellison report

It is feared the files may also have contained crucial clues over alleged corruption in the investigation into the murder of Mr Morgan in 1987. The private investigator was struck with an axe in the car park of a South-East London pub.

One potential link between the cases is suspect ‘bent’ ex-Met detectives John Davidson, who was slammed in the Ellison report for his work on the Lawrence case.

Davidson is suspected of working on the Morgan inquiry in its early stages, something the Met have repeatedly denied. He is also suspected of having links with the gangland father of Stephen’s killer, Norris.

Mr Morgan’s brother Alistair, 65, said he believed a corrupt ‘firm within a firm’ at the Met covered up both murders.

He said: ‘We want it all out in the open – everything. We won’t stop until it is.’

Mr Morgan said the mass shredding of  documents could jeopardise the work of an  independent review into his brother’s death.

‘The revelation of the shredding of the Othona files, I find very worrying,’ he added.

Operation Othona found criminal gangs were working closely with a ‘small but dedicated network of corrupt police officers’. Earlier this month Scotland Yard said: ‘At this time the Met has little detail on the circumstances that led to the shredding.’

Two men have been arrested for criminal 
damage after an attack on a memorial to Stephen Lawrence.

Police, who were called to the plaque in Eltham, South London shortly before 1pm yesterday, believe a vase full of flowers was knocked over, and that somebody spat on a commemorative plaque.

Both men, aged 18 and 19, were taken into custody and have now been bailed.

The memorial plaque was laid on the spot where Lawrence, who was stabbed to death 21 years ago, collapsed and died against a tree.

It is monitored 24 hours a day by a police CCTV camera across the road. A police van was parked by the spot for the whole of Sunday.

The stone has been the subject of attacks before and had to be replaced after one incident by vandals.

The memorial has acted as a focal point for family and friends and supporters to lay flowers and tributes to the youngster.

A marked police van was parked by the side of the memorial all day.
