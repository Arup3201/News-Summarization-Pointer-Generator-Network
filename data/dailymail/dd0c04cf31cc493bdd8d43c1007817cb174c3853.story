Shane Warne and his girlfriend Emily Scott were pictured relaxing in Las Vegas, and the spin bowler still had a cast on his broken right hand that he sustained at Lord's earlier this month.

The 44-year-old spin-bowling legend was hit on the hand by former Australia team-mate Brett Lee during the Lord's bicentenary match on July 5.

And Warne still had the cast on his hand as he went for a swim with his 30-year-old model girlfriend Scott in Las Vegas.

Warne was 
batting for a Rest of the World team when Lee, playing for an MCC side, 
bowled a beamer in his direction that forced him to withdraw from the 
match and left him with a broken hand.

Warne was captain of the Rest of the World side, who were beaten by seven wickets by a Sachin Tendulkar-led MCC team at Lord's.

During
 his glittering career, Warne took 708 wickets in Test matches as well 
as 293 in one-day internationals and 70 in T20 cricket for Australia as 
well.
