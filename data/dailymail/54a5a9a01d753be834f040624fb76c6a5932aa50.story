A family who created a 'bucket list' for their six-month-old baby girl that suffered from a rare genetic disorder, have a reason to be extra thankful this Thanksgiving.

Laura and Michael Canahuati welcomed 6-pound, 13-ounce Carter Bryant Canahuati to their family on Saturday.

Her older sister, Avery Lynn Canahuati, was born on 11/11/11 but died just six months later from  spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (SMA).

Her
father Mike had chronicled his daughter’s life in a blog, writing in 
her voice about all the things she wanted to do before she died, 
including wearing a big bow and going to a tea party.

When Avery was diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder called spinal muscular atrophy, the couple decided to channel their anger and grief and make memories out of every moment of their daughter’s life.

They created Avery’s bucket list, an online blog of every memorable moment the trio and their extended families shared. They shared it online and the story made national headlines.

Avery died a few weeks later, but her bucket list left a legacy of love, courage and hope.

The last photo of Avery, he wrote, was
taken 15-20 minutes before she stopped breathing. He said Avery was 
‘sitting on mommy’s lap looking at me and all it took to get her to 
smile this big was for me to keep saying “Hi.”’

Mike and Laura Canahuati received the heart-wrenching news, early in 2012 that their daughter Avery had less than 18 months to live.

Avery’s blog became something of 
an internet sensation – the website alone has garnered more than half a 
million page views, and her Facebook page has more than 12,000 ‘likes.’

Avery
‘wrote’ on her blog: ‘I have a lot of living to do in just a little bit
of time and I’m going to need all of the help I can get from my parents
and anyone else who wants to help.

‘Keep
in mind in everything I do, the two most important things are that I’m 
spending time with my mommy & daddy, while at the same time 
spreading awareness for SMA.’

The initial bucket list included several childhood milestones, such as going swimming, going on a road trip, sit on daddy’s shoulders, have a birthday party, and stay up past my bedtime watching TV with mommy and daddy.

One of goals on the list was a little more salacious: Get a tattoo.

muscular atrophy and died aged 6 months

The cheery blog has struck a chord with parents across the world. Mrs Canahuati told Good Morning America that’s when the couple knew they had a powerful platform on which to speak.

The mother said: ‘When we saw how many people it was reaching in a few days, that’s when we realised we could really get the word out on SMA and spread the word as much as we could.’

The disease is the number one killer of U.S. children under two, she said, though the disease is largely unknown.

She urged possible parents to get tested for the genetic disease before conceiving. 

‘Our goal for Avery is to be the face of SMA,’ she said.
