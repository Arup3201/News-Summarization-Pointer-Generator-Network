Roy Keane’s criticism of Everton is ‘nonsense’, according to Roberto Martinez.

Keane irritated Everton manager Martinez after claiming last weekend he puts pressure on his players not to represent the Republic of Ireland, using James McCarthy and Seamus Coleman as examples.

McCarthy has a hamstring problem that prevented him featuring in Ireland’s recent fixtures and is likely to stop him playing in Saturday's Goodison match against West Ham.

‘I’m sure there is an agenda,’ said Martinez.

‘We are in an age in football in which when injuries happen players get a scan and it’s not a subjective opinion; that’s gone out of the game.

‘James picked up a grade one hamstring problem against Sunderland. Normally with these injuries they clear between eight and 10 days but you are injured.’

The added sensitivity around the issue is that McCarthy was born in Scotland and Martinez feels Keane’s comments have created an unnecessary issue.

Martinez added: ‘If there is an issue it should be treated with respect, and privately, to try to get to the bottom of it. 

'To come out and make things public could (have) some of the Irish fans thinking that the players don’t want to play, or that Everton have stopped some players from playing. That’s nonsense. That’s ridiculous.’
