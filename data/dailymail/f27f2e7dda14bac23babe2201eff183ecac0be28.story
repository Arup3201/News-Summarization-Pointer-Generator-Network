Many reasons have been suggested to explain why  women remain poorly represented in senior positions at large companies.

Now, a new study may shed light on workplace dynamics, by claiming that while men enjoy competition in the office, women like to be part of a team.

The results suggest than men have a dimmer view of their colleagues’ ability than women and were therefore more keen on competing to be rewarded for their own work, rather than that of a team’s.

Researchers from CNRS-GATE in Lyon and the University of California, analysed the behaviour of both sexes when the study participants were asked to choose between being paid on their individual performance or as part of a team.

They found that less than 11 per cent of men opted for team payment, in comparison to 44 per cent of women.

The experts believe the reason for this is that men are more likely to think their colleagues may let them down and that even high-performing women were attracted by team working.

However, it is worth noting that the majority of both the sexes were keen to compete in the workplace on their own terms. 

‘While women tend to shy away from competition, the results suggest that men shy away from cooperation,’ said study author Peter Kuhn, professor of economics at the University of California. A stock image of two women working together is shown

Women dislike having a female boss at work more than men do, a previous study revealed.

Nearly 40 per cent of female workers in America would rather be led by a man, a Gallup survey found in October last year.

In contrast, just over one quarter of men would prefer a male boss, with 58 per cent not caring either way.

The study, which collected responses from 1,032 U.S. adults, found that only one-fifth of people would prefer to have a female boss if they were to take a new job. 

But it also revealed that workers who currently have a female boss were more likely to opt to be led by a woman, compared to those with a male boss, at 27 per cent and 15 per cent respectively. 

‘While women tend to shy away from competition, the results suggest that men shy away from cooperation,’ said study author Peter Kuhn, professor of economics at the University of California.

‘In fact, while part of the decision is a matter of preferences, the difference is mainly explained by the fact that compared with men, women hold much less pessimistic beliefs about the relative performance of their potential team members.’

The study, published in the Economic Journal, also found that when there was a small economic advantage to working in a team, a similar number of men and women chose it.

Previous research has found that men react more strongly to monetary incentives so a small financial incentive may boost men’s enthusiasm for working in teams especially.

Co-author Professor Marie Claire Villeval, of CNRS-GATE, said: ‘Individuals who choose the team compensation scheme tend to perform less well on average than those who choose to be paid based on their own performance.

‘This results from the fact that the less able workers anticipate that by joining a team, they can improve their earnings thanks to the higher productivity of their colleagues. But this is less true for women than for men.’

Although the number of female CEOs of Fortune 500 companies  reached a historic high in 2014, only 4.8 per cent of this elite group are women.

Last year, a Cancer Research UK study found that women are still lacking in self-confidence, not putting themselves forward for promotion, and perceive men to have advantages over them.

A quarter of the women (26 per cent) interviewed said they felt that adopting stereotypical male characteristics could help them to get to the top of their field.

Meanwhile, one in five women (20 per cent) believed gender discrimination at work had made it more difficult for them to reach their career goals.

And over a third (38 per cent) said lack of confidence in their own abilities and a reluctance to push for promotions (37 per cent) was making it harder for them to reach progress up the ladder.

Other potential barriers for women making the leap into management positions were found to include lack of flexible working arrangements to allow for childcare and the 'negative' attitudes of employers and colleagues with regard to balancing work and family life.

Previous studies have argued that women are reluctant to enter jobs or sectors that thrive on competitive behaviour, while men, in contrast, are more attracted to competition - a view unpopular with some feminists.

Professor Villeval said: ‘There is no doubt that reaching top positions in business or winning an election requires competitiveness.

‘But if women tend to avoid competitive environments, it seems important to have a better understanding of which types of working environments do attract women, and how women fare relative to men in those environments.

‘In particular, are women more attracted than men to cooperative working environments? The findings of this research suggest that the answer is yes.’

CEO and author Margaret Heffernan, who has written a book about competition in the workplace disagrees that women aren't as competative as men.

She cites behavioural economist Uri Geneezy who found that in matriarchal societies, the women are the more competitive sex.

'In other words, coming from a culture in which they were accustomed to power and success, women were more than willing to enter the fray,' she wrote in The Huffington Post. 

'The problem isn't, therefore, that women aren't competitive. The problem is that, in our society, they're smart and able enough to see that they're unlikely to win.'

'...It's evident that while many well-performing female hurt themselves financially by shying away from competition, poorly performing males also hurt themselves by embracing it.'
