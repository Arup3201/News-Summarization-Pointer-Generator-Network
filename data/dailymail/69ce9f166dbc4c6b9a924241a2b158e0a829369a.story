Marius Siurkus was deported from Britain after committing burglary but was found living back at his Peterborough home only 12 days later

One in five attempts to deport foreign criminals fail, while the number of crimes committed by immigrants has doubled in the past five years, new figures reveal.

Last year foreign criminals were responsible for 14 per cent of serious crimes such as murders, rapes and robberies - a rate that has jumped 50 per cent since 2008.

The high rate of offending coincides with news 20 per cent of last year's deportations were classed as 'failed removals' - meaning the Home Office failed to deport the offender.

The figures were compiled by the Sun on Sunday, which also reported migrants commit about 220,000 crimes a year.

A Lithuanian burglar recently made headlines after he was released from prison early and deported only to be found living back at his Peterborough home 12 days later.

Police believe Marius Siurkus, 32, may have returned hoping to retrieve stolen jewellery he hid under floorboards.

Incredibly, Siurkus’s accomplice in the burglary, countryman Mantas Pronckus, has twice been freed from prison early and deported – only to return to the UK and continue offending.

MailOnline has requested comment from the Home Office. 

Just two months ago Britain's top police officer warned the criminal justice situation was not adapting quickly enough to cope with the impact of immigration.

Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said more than half of all foreign criminals caught in Britain have a right to stay that prevents them being deported.

Earlier this year the Government pledged that arrested foreign nationals – including EU citizens – will face deportation even if they are not convicted of any crime.

The crackdown will use a European law that states those wanting to remain here must be exercising their right to work or be self-sufficient.

This could be used to tackle groups such as the capital’s notorious Park Lane beggars, a group largely from Eastern European countries such as Romania. 

The control of European criminals across EU borders has come under the spotlight in recent weeks after it emerged the prime suspect in the disappearance of 14-year-old Alice Gross had murdered his wife in his native country 17 years ago.

Arnis Zalkalns, 41, convinced officers in Latvia that his wife Rudite had gone missing - when he had actually hit her with a metal bar, stabbed her in the heart and buried her in a forest.

The jobbing builder served six-and-a-half years of an eight-year jail sentence before leaving for Britain in 2005.

He remains at the centre of an international manhunt after being named as the prime suspect in the case of Alice, who vanished from a West London towpath more than three weeks ago.
