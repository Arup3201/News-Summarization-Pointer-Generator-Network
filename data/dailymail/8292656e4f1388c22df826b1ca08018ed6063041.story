A pregnant Florida woman has lost her baby after she was shot in the stomach earlier this week, allegedly by a woman with whom she'd been feuding on Facebook.

Police were called the scene - in the 9100 block of Castle Boulevard in Jacksonville - about noon Wednesday after there was a report of an argument and a shooting.

Video after the shooting by neighbor Christopher Cash shows the victim slumped in a chair as neighbors rush to help her. It also shows the suspect, 35-year-old Virginia Wyche, being taken into custody.

Victim: The unidentified pregnant victim slumped into a chair after she was shot in the stomach. Her baby didn't survive

Suspect: Virginia Wyche and the victim had a disagreement over Facebook, which led to a fight during which Wyche allegedly shot the victim in the stomach

The unidentified victim was taken to a local hospital and survived. Her unborn baby was pronounced deadÂ 

'They were arguing out front, something about Facebook. I walked out and just heard a pop,' Cash told WTEV.

Witnesses say the two women got into an argument on Facebook Tuesday night. On Wednesday, the victim went to Wyche's house to confront her about the disagreement.

The argument turned physical, and that's when Wyche allegedly shot the pregnant victim.

'I know the victim was definitely shot in the abdomen. That's the one 
gun shot that I know of. That's why the consideration and concern for 
the unborn child's health,' Jacksonville Sgt. Michael Paul told News4Jax.com before it was learned that the baby had died.

The suspect's mother, Lillian Jordan, told the station she is as confused as everyone else about what led up to the shooting at her home.

'My son called me and I was very disturbed about this because this is 
not the way I was raised, and they (were) not raised like this,' Jordan told reporters. 'Somebody had to provoke my child ... to do what she (did). I 
don't know if she was trying to defend herself, or if they (were) trying
 to jump on my child, I can't say.'

Wyche was booked into jail on one count of murder and one count of attempted murder.

Investigators say they will continue to look into whether the suspect shot the victim in self-defense.
