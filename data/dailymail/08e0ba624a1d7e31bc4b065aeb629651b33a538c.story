This is the moment a knife-wielding Chinese schoolboy leapt from a 25ft-high sign advertising life insurance.

Guang Yeh, 18, jumped from the board, reading 'Taikang Life', in front of horrified bystanders in Hangzhou, east China.Â 

He survived the plunge after firemen managed to set up an inflatable mattress beneath the sign.

Shocking: A knife-wielding schoolboy leaps from a 25-foot sign advertising life insurance in Hangzhou, China

Plunge: Mr Yeh, 18, jumps from the board, reading 'Taikang Life', in front of bystanders and emergency crews

Saved: He survived the plunge after firemen managed to set up an inflatable mattress beneath the sign

Mr Yeh had threatened potential rescuers with a knife as he sat atop the board, advertising one of China's biggest life insurance companies.

While police officers climbed onto the hoarding in a bid to persuade him to come down, several firefighters managed to covertly set up the mattress on the ground.

Officers then attempted to grab the teenager - causing him to leap off the sign and land safely on the mattress below.

Eyewitness Lili Yuan said the rescue operation had been carried out 'very smoothly'.

Negotiations: Mr Yeh sits atop the board, which advertises one of China's biggest life insurance companies

Threat: The teenager waves a knife at police officers, who had climbed onto the sign in a bid to rescue him

'They packed the area 
behind the man with police and fireman,' she said.

'The officers talked to him and made lots of noise to indicate they were coming onto the sign, which made him watch them instead of what was going on below.

'Then they rushed him, making him jump once the mattress was in place.'

After landing on the mattress, Mr Yeh was restrained by police and carried to a waiting ambulance.

Recovery: After landing on the mattress, Mr Yeh is carried to a waiting ambulance by emergency crews

Future: He faces either being committed to a psychiatric hospital, or taken to court for causing a disturbance

He was then taken by ambulance to a local psychiatric hospital in the Zhejiang province.

The teenager now faces either being committed to the hospital, or taken to court for causing a disturbance.

A police spokesman said: 'He was unhurt by the incident and sedated after he was put inside the ambulance.'
