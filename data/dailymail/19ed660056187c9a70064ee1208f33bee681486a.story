Defying the tanks: A Beijing citizen stand sin front of tanks in Tiananmen Square in 1989

There is one photograph that encapsulates the stand-off between the Chinese army and democracy campaigners in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square.

It shows a man standing in front of three tanks. In his hand he is holding a carrier bag, rather as if he’s been rudely interrupted while out shopping.

No one has ever identified the man, but that’s not the strangest thing about the photo — it’s the fact that in China today scarcely anyone has seen it.

While Louisa Lim was researching this book on the legacy of the Tiananmen massacre, she showed the photo to students at four of China’s top universities. Out of 100 students, only 15 knew what it was. The rest hadn’t got a clue.

A quarter of a century on, the events of June 4, 1989 have simply disappeared, expunged from people’s memories and history books.

Tiananmen Square has been restored to a site of national pride. Yet it was here that the Chinese authorities turned the full force of their wrath on campaigners who had occupied the square for seven weeks.

Up to 250,000 troops were sent in, with orders to clear out everyone as swiftly as possible. In the ensuing battle, around 2,000 students were killed — there’s never been an accurate death toll.

Afterwards, the troops built a huge bonfire of all the students’ possessions, the blood was hosed off the pavement and that, on the surface at least, was that.

But Lim doesn’t have to do much digging to uncover the scars that remain. Several of the soldiers who took part in the massacre remain haunted by it.

Ever since, one soldier, a man called Chen Guang who became an artist, has obsessively painted two pictures over and over again.

The first shows a cheap plastic wristwatch — soldiers who took part in the massacre were given watches as souvenirs.

The other is of a woman whose hair has been sheared off. When the square had been cleared, Guang saw a plait of hair tangled in the spokes of a bike — and he’s never been able to get the image out of his head.

One of the dissidents, who spent seven years in prison, has not eaten food for ten years. He’s subsisted on milk as a protest at the way he and others were treated.

The student leaders rounded up on June 4 were sent to penal colonies — one was so vast that a Japanese visitor who spent two days touring it by car still didn’t see the whole site.

There, some were forced to eat strips of toilet paper soaked in urine — known as Noodles in Clear Broth. Others had their backs speared with sharpened bamboos, rubbed with salt and flayed — this was known as Twice Cooked Pork on an Iron Platter.

A few, though, were luckier. Perhaps the most remarkable story of all is how several dissidents were smuggled out of China with the help of the Hong Kong Triads. This bizarre alliance of pro-democracy activists and some of the most brutal criminals in the world was funded by the pop star Anita Mui — ‘The Madonna of Hong Kong’.

But the biggest effect of Tiananmen Square hasn’t been the scars it’s left. It’s been the way it prompted a radical change in Chinese society. 

To deter further protests, the authorities came up with a brilliant plan: they would give students something even more alluring than freedom — money.

Within a few years China had ditched communism and transformed into a money-crazed society.

Several of the dissident leaders became multi-millionaires. One recently made a public statement of regret about his involvement in the pro-democracy movement: ‘I have a responsibility to my shareholders that is more important than politics.’

Students are now far too preoccupied with making money to worry about human rights. Successful entrepreneurs — the once despised  ‘running dogs of capitalism’ — are venerated as near-gods.

When the biography of Steve Jobs was published there in 2011, the print run of 250,000 sold out on the first day.

All this has left those participants who haven’t embraced capitalism baffled and saddened. A former Communist Party official who supported the protest, and who spent seven years in solitary confinement for his pains, says simply: ‘Everything that I have seen has left me disappointed.’

As well as being a scrupulously researched book, this is an unusually brave one. Lim, a former BBC correspondent in Beijing, lives in America but has relatives in China and is fearful about exposing them to danger.

She’s done a terrific job of analysing how the world’s fourth largest country beat out the flames of revolt with bundles of cash.
