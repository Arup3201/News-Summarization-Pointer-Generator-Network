A veterinary nurse is preparing to spend 48 hours in a cage to highlight the cramped conditions that many rabbits are forced to leave in while being kept as pets.  

Emma Purnell, 30, from Upton-upon-Severn, will also be limiting her food intake to carrots and muesli during the stint, which will last from tomorrow evening to Sunday night. 

She will wear a bunny onesie for the event has had the cage, which measures 5ft 6ins long, 2ft 6ins wide and 4ft 6ins tall, erected at The Stocks Veterinary Centre in Upton-upon-Severn where she works. 

Emma Purnell, 30, is going to be living in a human-sized rabbit hutch for 48 hours 

Money raised from sponsorship of the event will go to the Fat Fluffs and the Windwhistle Warren rabbit rescues. 

Speaking to MailOnline about her decision to go through with the task, she said: 'I have been hoping to do something for both these local charities for a while. 

'While I was brainstorming, I came up with the idea of being that rabbit that we see in practice and in rescues that is treated as we used to believe was ok.

'The rabbits that live in a small hutch with no space or stimulation, with a poor diet which often leads to dental problems, no company of fellow rabbits, generally just a bit of a miserable existence.'

Emma believes that the problem lies in the fact that people don't understand how to care for rabbits properly.

She said: 'I was hoping that doing it this way is just silly enough to grab a bit of attention and make a few people think if there were some little changes they could make to improve life for their pet just a little. 

'Rabbits are such misunderstood pets - they are still often seen as a child first pet, but they are really not suitable for this, they are nervous creatures that can, if handled improperly, even fracture their own spine. 

'They need space, time, another bonded rabbit for company, vaccinations and, when ill, can go downhill very quickly. 

'Rabbits are the third most popular pet in the UK, yet the most neglected - which is not simply due to cruelty, it is often a misunderstanding of their needs and they are really beloved pets. 

'If this can make a couple of people think it is worth it to me.'
