Police have shot a 43-year-old man during an armed siege in Liverpool today after he allegedly took his wife hostage at gunpoint before holding a knife to her throat.

Merseyside Police officers threw smoke bombs into the house and kicked down the door after a 40-minute stand-off where 'at least 10 shots were fired', witnesses said.

Two children, seven and 11, fled the property in Shellingford Road, Dovecot, and took refuge at a neighbour's house, an eyewitness said.

Police said they were called at 7am and after negotiations with the man failed he was shot in the 'upper body' and is in a serious but stable condition at Royal Liverpool Hospital.

The hostage, in her twenties, was uninjured but left very shaken by the incident, a source said.

A window in the house appears to have been smashed by a bullet and there was broken glass and debris in its front garden.

A police spokesman said: 'A firearm and knives were recovered from the property and will be sent off for examination. The scene remains cordoned off at this time and the property is currently being searched and examined'.

Neighbours have described the drama as they watched armed officers flood their street.

Neighbours described the drama as they watched armed officers flood their street.

One told the Liverpool Echo: 'I saw the police get out of their vans with their masks on. They were throwing smoke bombs in.

'Then the door got smashed in and the next minute "bang, bang, bang, bang". We thought the fella had got away because they kept shooting'.

Another man 
told BBC Radio Merseyside: 'I seen the man at the window. He was holding a knife to his 
wife's throat and they were trying to calm him down, negotiate with him -
 he was shaking his head at them. The woman came out and the police got 
her out and the police moved in with the guns.

'I
 heard shots fire - about 10. There was more after that. It looked like 
he ran away from them. It went quiet and then I heard more shots fired.'

During the armed assault snipers were stood on the roofs of houses across the street.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission has confirmed there has been a 'non fatal police shooting' and they have launched an inquiry.

A police helicopter is flying above the area and around half a dozen police vans and armed police are in the cul-de-sac in the east of the city, which has been sealed off.

One witness said: 'At about 8.40am I heard gunshots, there must have been at least 10.'

Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'It was really early in the morning when it all kicked off.

'Loads
 of police cars arrived and they put the cordon up straight away. The 
man had a knife to her throat and started waving it in the air to the 
police.

'There were loads of gunshots. The police went around the back of the house and somehow the woman got out.

'She was taken in a car to safety so it seems like she was ok.

'The man was taken out of the house on a stretcher with a white sheet over him covered in blood.

'It was a frightening experience and I'm just glad the kids and the woman got out alive after what he did.'
