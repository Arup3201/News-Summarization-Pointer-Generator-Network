The suspected ringleader and seven members of a gang behind a £1.3million cyber raid on a leading bank were arrested yesterday.

Scotland Yard detectives say the 47-year-old Mr Big led the operation that siphoned off cash from the accounts of Barclays customers.

One of the gang posed as an IT engineer at the bank’s branch in Swiss Cottage, north London, to install a device that hacked into its computer systems.

Cyber-attack:  Scotland Yard said today it had held eight men who they believed hacked a branch in Swiss Cottage, north London (pictured) to get £1.3m

Hacking: The Met Police has said a device similar to this was used by criminals, which when plugged into a computer transmits screen contents to a remote PC

But staff spotted the fraud and 
tipped off police. Following a lengthy surveillance operation, the trail
 led to a flat in nearby Marylebone, which was crammed with hi-tech 
equipment.

Eight men, including Chinese and 
Romanians, were in custody last night. Thousands of credit cards and 
financial records were seized at addresses across the capital. 

Santander raid: How the Mail reported it on September 14

The gang is thought to be linked to 
the criminals behind last week’s raid on a London branch of Santander 
using an identical spying device.Detective Superintendent Terry Wilson, 
who is a specialist in electronic crime, said: ‘This was a 
highly-organised criminal network with each individual filling a 
specific role.

‘All criminal networks have a head 
and we very much believe we have now apprehended our Mr Big as part of 
this operation. We believe this has put a major dent in this network’s 
ability to commit cyber-crime in this country. We believe this was a 
top-tier criminal network.’

Similarities: Last week a gang allegedly attempted to plug a discreet gizmo into a Santander computer to spy on its contents.

He said his officers were working with banks to stop further thefts.

Barclays has been able to recover a 
‘significant amount’ of the money stolen in the Swiss Cottage operation 
by tracing the accounts into which the cash was moved.

A
 'big mixture of nerdiness and having some nerves' would be needed to 
try to pull off this type of fraud, according to internet security 
expert Graham Cluley.

Since
 part of the crime involves walking into a branch and attaching the 
gadget to a computer, this would need 'a bit of bottle on the part of 
the criminal but you would have to be technical on the other end to be 
able to get the information'.

Valuable data such as access to keyboard strokes and what is happening on-screen could be obtained, according to Mr Cluley.

A
 KVM would be about 8ins by 6ins by 3ins in size and would probably look
 like 'another anonymous box with loads of wires', he noted.

He
 said: 'They (would-be criminals) would need physical access to your 
computer and the best way to do that is to be part of the cleaning staff
 or part of the IT team and to just work in the office and plug the 
thing in.

'With human nature being what it is, people do not often confront people they see as new in these roles in their office.

'Organisations
 need to have proper physical security in place and foster an attitude 
so staff can challenge people and say 'Where is your pass?'.

'It is not just money that could be stolen, but also data.'

But customers are angry they were not told about the breach, which took place in April.

Speaking outside the branch, Joseph 
Mendy, 52, said: ‘I thought this would be something we would’ve been 
informed about. I am shocked to hear about it.’

Alex Grant, of Barclays, insisted the protection and security of its customers was its highest priority.

‘We identified the fraud and acted swiftly to recover funds on the same day,’ he added.Graham Cluley, a technology expert, says cyber criminals are combining ‘nerdiness with nerves’ to carry out the thefts.

‘It takes a certain degree of bravery
 to walk into a bank and do this posing as an IT technician,’ he said. 
‘While these people no longer carry the physical threat of the bank 
robbers of the 70s armed with a gun and a stocking over their head, they
 are putting themselves at risk. It raises questions about whether 
Barclays had enough security in place to spot the unusual movement of 
money, as well as the physical security of its branches.’

The hackers planted spying hardware 
known as a ‘kvm switch’, standing for keyboard, video and mouse. 
Purchased online for less than £100, this allows a single user to 
control several computers from a remote location.

Four men, from Hounslow, west London, have appeared in court charged with conspiracy to steal in the Santander raid.
