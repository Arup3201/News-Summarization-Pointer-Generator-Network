Angelina Jolie has said that Labour’s proposed mansion tax could deter her from moving to England.

The actress, who is rumoured to have been house-hunting in London, said: ‘I’m quite responsible about money. [Mansion tax] could put me off.’

Miss Jolie made the comments last night during a trip to the UK for the premiere of her latest film, Unbroken.

The family (pictured here leaving a performance of the musical Wicked) have stayed in London many times over the years for separate film projects

She made sure she was the centre of attention on the red carpet in a rather unusual white silk two-piece by British designer Ralph & Russo.

From the front, it looked like a fitted dress beneath a curious bolero cape. But the back was an even more striking affair, featuring a daring split and an array of buttons and bows.

Hours earlier, the 39-year-old had been interviewed by Jon Snow on Channel 4 News. Asked about a possible move to the UK, she said: ‘It was just a rumour that started and I think the rumour came before I had even thought about it.’

But she added: ‘They’ve [the media] figured out that I’m quite fond of England.

'I have lived here before and in the future it would be very nice to have a foothold here for work. Some kind of an office I think would be nice.’

When asked about Mr Miliband’s plans for a punitive tax on people with homes worth more than £2million, she admitted: ‘That could put me off.’

Miss Jolie and her husband, actor Brad Pitt, were said to have been looking at properties in central London and had recently viewed a £25million Marylebone penthouse.

If they do buy in the upmarket area, they will be moments away from celebrity hotspot the Chiltern Firehouse - where Jennifer Aniston, Princess Beatrice and Kylie Minogue have dined this month.

Jolie has looked at homes priced at up to £20million, a local source told The Sunday Times. 

It was revealed that a number of lavish apartments have gone on sale in the area, part of a new property development called The Chilterns.

One four-bedroom penthouse - which boasts David Bailey artwork and an in-house chef - is on the market at £25million. 

Perks include an on-site gym and a 24-hour hotel-style concierge which will take care of everything from travel arrangements and theatre tickets to dry cleaning and shopping. 

And a neighbouring plot, designed by top architects Squire & Partners, is on the market for £12.6million. 

It is not yet clear whether Jolie and Pitt are planning to move with their six children to London permanently.

Their main home is Chateau Miraval, their sprawling estate nestled in an ancient village in the south of France. 

The property is surrounded by a moat, and boasts a spa, two gyms, and an indoor swimming pool. 

The couple chose the stunning chateau as the venue for their private wedding ceremony - attended by just 22 guests - this summer. 

The Jolie-Pitts recently spent several months living in England as  Pitt, 50, filmed his latest film Fury in Oxfordshire. and have been said to enjoy long stays in Richmond  at a friend's home, while Brad filmed zombie blockbuster World War Z.

It is not the first time the couple have hinted that Britain's tax policies might put them off a move to these shores. 

In 2013, when asked if the couple would consider a move to Britain permanently, Mr Pitt replied: ‘Yeah, we do [love it],’ he said. ‘It’s good fun here, it’s good fun. Still…work on the tax issues.’

There has been criticism from experts that the so-called mansion tax will be extremely difficult to implement if homeowners have to self-declare their property’s value. 

Celebrities Griff Rhys Jones and Myleene Klass have already publicly attacked the plan.

Miss Klass took it up with Mr Miliband personally when she met him during a TV appearance.

And yesterday Bill Oddie added his name to the chorus of protesters, announcing that he will not vote Labour next year. 

The wildlife presenter wrote on Twitter: ‘I hereby confess that I am one of the mansion owning North London set that are apparently staunch Labour. Not this time. I shall vote GREEN.’

The plan has been attacked even within the Labour party as a ‘tax on London’, where 90 per cent of the homes that would be affected are. 

The couple have six children and their main home is Chateau Miraval in the south of France where they married in August.

Unbroken, which is released on Boxing Day, tells the story of Louis Zamperini, a former Olympic runner who was captured and sent to a Japanese prisoner of war camp after his plane went down in the Pacific during the Second World War.

Miss Jolie was joined on the red carpet in London by veterans of past conflicts, and had pinned a poppy brooch to her dress as a mark of respect.

Ed Miliband was left humiliated last week after he was unceremoniously taken to task by Myleene Klass over Labour’s proposed mansion tax.

The former Hear'Say singer tore strips out of his pledge to impose a tax on homes worth more than £2million.

 Mr Miliband tried to laugh the row off, writing on Twitter that the NHS needs a mansion tax 'Pure and Simple' - a reference to Hear'Say's biggest hit song.

TV viewers provided a running commentary on Twitter, describing how the singer was ‘doing a Paxman’ and ‘wiping the floor’ with the man who hopes to be the next prime minister.

Appearing on ITV’s The Agenda, Miss Klass told him: ‘For me, it’s so disturbing – the name in its own right: “mansion tax”.

'Immediately you conjure up an image of these Barbie-esque houses, but in London, which is where 80 per cent of the people who will be paying this tax actually live, have you seen what that amount of money can get you? It’s like a garage.

‘When you do look at the people who will be suffering this tax, it’s true a lot of them are grannies who have had these houses in their families for a long, long time. 

'The people who are the super-super rich buying their houses for £140million, this is not necessarily going to affect them because they’ve got their tax rebates and amazing accountants. It’s going to be the little grannies who have lived in those houses for years and years.’

Mr Miliband responded: ‘I totally understand that people don’t like paying more in tax. The values of my government are going to be different to the values of this government.’

Appearing on ITV’s The Agenda, Miss Klass told him: ‘You may as well just tax me on this glass of water. You can’t just point at things and tax them.'

But former British ambassador to the US, Sir Christopher Meyer joined in the debate and angrily told Mr Miliband: ‘You’re going to screw me royally.’ 

Host Tom Bradby tried to calm things down, saying: ‘Ed’s getting a bit isolated here.’

But Miss Klass, 36, interrupted: ‘Ed’s getting isolated because no one thinks it is going to work.’

Getting more frustrated, she added: ‘You may as well just tax me on this glass of water. You can’t just point at things and tax them.

‘You need to have a better strategy and say why is the NHS in this mess in the first place?’ The confrontation immediately started trending on Twitter.
