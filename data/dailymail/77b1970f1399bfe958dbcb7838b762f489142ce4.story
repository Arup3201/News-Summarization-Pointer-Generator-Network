Classical composer Richard Wagner suffered from crippling migraines, the pain of which he used to compose some of his best works, scientists claim.

Extracts from the musical genius’ memoirs revealed he experienced ‘nervous headaches’ while composing his opera Siegfried in September 1865.

His depiction of his suffering included a 'scintillating, flickering, glimmering melody line with a zig-zag pattern' while a main character sings of 'Loathsome light!' as well as 'rustling and humming and blustering.'

The opera also opens with a pulsating thumping which gradually becomes more intense until it reaches an 'almost painful pulsation'.

At the climax, the main character cries out 'compulsive plague! Pain without end!' which the researchers in Wagner’s native Germany believe is a representation of a 'painful, pulsating sensory migraine episode'.

The research team claim his music has the characteristics of a typical migraine and the experimental flicker frequency gives 'important clues' about the performance speed intended by Wagner.

Despite describing his symptoms as the ‘main plague of his life’ the composer frequently performed operas worldwide.

His private writings also revealed he was ‘severely burdened’ by migraine and used his suffering creatively 'letting future generations take part in his emotions and perceptions'.

Writing to fellow composer Franz Liszt in 1857 he said: 'I was literally not able to write a single bar without being driven away from my work by the most tremendous headaches.'

In a video abstract, the researchers explain how 'his pain is in the centre of his music' and question what his music would have been like had Wagner been treated for his headaches and migraines.

Researcher Carl Gobel from the Deaprtment of Neirology at of the University Hospital of Cologne, said: 'Here we show how Wagner deeply interwove his migraine attacks and auras into his music and libretti.'

The findings are published in the Christmas edition of the British Medical Journal.
