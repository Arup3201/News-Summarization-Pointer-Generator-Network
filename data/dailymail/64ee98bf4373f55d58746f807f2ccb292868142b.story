The small energy firm Ed Miliband switched to so he could cut his fuel bills has warned his prize freeze could drive it out of business.

First Utility, the energy company he swapped to after receiving a £1,000 bill from E.On, hit out at the Labour leader’s strategy for bringing down prices.

Mr Miliband told the Mail on Sunday that he and wife Justine decided to switch from E.On to First Utility after a 9 per cent price hike.

The energy firm that Labour Party Leader Ed Miliband has switched to says it will go bankrupt if his price fix becomes law

He decided that the £1000 bill last winter was the last straw and told the German energy giant it had just lost a customer.

He joined First Utility, a smaller firm outside the Big Six dominating the market.

First Utility announced its own price freeze until March this September, just after the Labour leader pledged to cap energy prices for 20 months if he wins power.

First Utility chief executive Ian McCraig said Miliband's price freeze 'could put me under'

But First Utility chief executive Ian McCaig said Mr Miliband’s price freeze was impractical for small suppliers.

‘Bluntly, it could put me under,’ he said.

Instead, the company wants to control its own prices and when it offers discounts to customers.

First Utility has pledged not to hike up gas and electricity charges until after the winter and has challenged the Big Six to follow.
