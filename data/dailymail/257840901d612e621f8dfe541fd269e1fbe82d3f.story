Schools in some parts of the country are having to raid their own budgets to pay for Nick Clegg’s plan to give four to seven-year-old pupils free meals.

Freedom of Information figures suggest nearly a third of councils cannot afford to provide free school lunches for infants from September.

In some areas, schools themselves could have to pay towards the expensive kitchen and dining room upgrades needed to deliver the policy.

Schools are having to raid their own budgets to pay for kitchen and dining room upgrades to provide free school meals for children after Nick Clegg made a pledge at last year's Liberal Democrat Conference

In Somerset, primaries with more than 150 pupils are being asked to contribute a total of £250,000 – 25 per cent of the cost of improving kitchens.

And Lambeth council in London said schools will be funding £150,000 worth of upgrades.

Overall, across 29 councils, there is a funding shortfall of at least £23million. 

The figures will add to controversy surrounding the policy, which was announced by the Deputy Prime Minister at last year’s Liberal Democrat party conference.

Tory sources said the £600million plan was drawn up ‘on the back of a fag packet’ as part of a coalition deal, which saw the Lib Dems agree not to oppose similarly expensive tax breaks for married couples.

But many primary school heads warned at the time that they did not have the space or kitchen facilities to provide for an extra 1.5million children.

Sources claim that Mr Clegg failed to take into account the cost of improving school kitchens to meet the demand, forcing the Government to offer more money for upgrades. 

The Department for Education is refusing to release warning emails, understood to have been sent by the Treasury to officials and ministers, pointing out potential problems with the funding of the scheme.

Mr Clegg has insisted that the plan is fully funded, but Freedom of Information requests have revealed a gap of £23million as Tory's accuse Clegg of drawing the idea up 'on the back of a fag packet'

Mr Clegg insisted last month that the plan was ‘fully funded’. But Labour’s shadow schools minister Kevin Brennan said it was increasingly clear the policy was ‘a complete shambles’, adding: ‘David Cameron urgently needs to explain to parents why some schools will be forced to fund this commitment out of their own budgets, how this will affect standards at those schools and which children will be missing out in September.’

Responses to Freedom of Information requests by Mr Brennan reveal that almost a third of councils have not been given enough money by the Government to fund the programme from September.

Of the 43 councils that said it was not enough, 29 provided details of their estimated shortfalls – a total of £23,036,824.

Kent County Council has a shortfall of around £4.3million, while Enfield and Hampshire councils both have shortfalls of at least £3million.

Initially, Mr Clegg promised that all free lunches would be a hot meal. But this was downgraded to an aspiration rather than a commitment once problems with kitchens were raised.

Last week, it emerged that more than 3,000 schools will buy in pre-prepared meals and either keep them warm or reheat them in mini-kitchens.

Dozens of others will offer only cold lunches, in some cases at pupils’ desks.
