Father Massimo Donghi lied to his friends and told them he was going on a spiritual retreat but was actually on the Concordia cruise liner disaster

A Roman Catholic priest who lied to his flock and told them he was going on a spiritual retreat is actually a survivor from the Concordia cruise liner disaster, it emerged today.

Father Massimo Donghi’s double life was unmasked on Facebook after his niece Elisabetta, who was with him on the ill fated Concordia, posted that she and all her family 'including uncle Massimo' were safe and well.

The 41-year-old clergyman had told church parishioners earlier this month that he was going on a ‘spiritual retreat’ for a couple of weeks and had arranged for a substitute priest to cover for him while he took time out to reflect on his vows as well as meditate and pray.

Locals at Besana Brianza near Milan were delighted for him and waved him off with their full backing - although today they were furious to learn that instead of being on a retreat he had set off on a week’s cruise and was among more than 4,000 passengers and crew on the doomed boat that hit rocks two weeks ago.

One furious local said:'It’s a bit 
difficult to understand how he was going to go on a spiritual retreat 
onboard a cruise liner.

All those comforts and luxuries, all that 
onboard enjoyment it just doesn’t sit well with a spiritual, prayerful 
retreat. We are not at all happy that we have been tricked here and we 
want to see what Father Massimo and the diocese have to say.'

Father Massimo had boarded the Concordia
at Civitavecchia with several members of his family for the week’s 
cruise and they were among those who were rescued as the ship went down 
just off the coast of Giglio with the death toll now standing at 16 dead
and at least 13 still missing.

On board: The 41-year-old clergyman had told parishioners that he was going on a 'spiritual retreat' for a couple of weeks but had really boarded the Concordia cruise liner disaster

Within hours of being rescued Elisabetta wrote on her Facebook page:

'Uncle Massimo and granny Imelda are all safe. We all managed to get onto the lifeboats and we are safe and well.'

The posting was spotted by friends who 
quickly spread the word that Father Massimo - who was in the headlines 
last year after he wrote a letter to a religious magazine slamming 
controversial former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi  for his dubious 
private life - was actually on a luxury cruise instead of being on a 
spiritual retreat as he had said.

Protest: A banner reading 'Giglio cries out - Hands off Captain Palombo' hangs on a balcony close to the stricken cruise liner in reference to the retired Captain Mario Palombo, that the Concordia's captain was waving to when the ship ran aground

On his Facebook page Father Massimo says he has been a priest since 1996 at Besana and he also lists Inter Milan as his favourite football team, as well as Pope John XIII as one of his inspirations - as well as the film The King’s Speech.

Today when contacted an embarrassed sounding Father Massimo said: 'Well what more do you expect me to say? You have all the story. There is nothing to add. I’m still a little shocked but everyone who I was with is okay. I will explain everything to my parishioners when I get back to the church - I’m not bothered about what people say about me. God Bless. Good day.'

No-one was available for official comment at his local bishop’s office but a source there said: 'We are aware of the reports and shall be speaking to him to hear what he has to say. We have had calls from the church from parishioners who were concerned.'
