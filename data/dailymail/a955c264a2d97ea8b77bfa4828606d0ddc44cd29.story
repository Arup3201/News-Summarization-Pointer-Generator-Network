A girl with cerebral palsy has learned to talk, walk and play by copying her healthy twin sister, her parents claim.

Four-year-old Felicity Williams has cerebral palsy, which causes movement problems as well as communication and learning difficulties.

But thanks to copying her twin sister, Tiffany, she has managed to surprise her parents with her progress.

The twins have recently started classes together and 'love it', according to their father 

The twins' parents, Gary, 28, and Hayley, 27, believe that it's thanks to the girls' special bond that Felicity has developed so well.

Mrs Williams, from Walsall, in the West Midlands,s aid: 'We're so proud of our girls.

'Felicity has been able to watch her sister reach lots of milestones, and through copying has been able to reach them too.

'Tiffany has shown her sister how to roll over and sit up, and even walk.

'When Felicity began to speak, she was saying words that she'd heard her sister say.

'Even now, as the girls learn to read, Tiffany will help Felicity sound out words when she gets confused.

'We have always believed in Felicity and we know she'll do well, but Tiffany has made a huge difference to her.

'They certainly have that twin thing going on - they're soul mates.'

The couple first noticed Tiffany's huge influence on her twin sister when the girls were learning to walk.

Mrs Williams said: 'We were starting to worry as Felicity had got to 18 months old and she still wasn't walking - the cerebral palsy has really affected her right leg so it was a concern.

Cerebral palsy is the general term for conditions that affect movement and co-ordination.

It is estimated that 1 in 400 people in the UK is affected.

It is caused by problems in the parts of the brain responsible for controlling muscles.

The condition occurs if the brain is damaged before, during or shorly after birth, usually due to loss of oxygen.

It can be caused by a difficult or premature birth, an infection caught by the mother during pregnancy, bleeding in the baby’s brain or mutations in genes that affect brain development.

The symptoms of cerebral palsy normally become apparent during the first three years of a child's life.

The main symptoms are:

· muscle stiffness or floppiness

· muscle weakness

· random and uncontrolled body movements

· balance and co-ordination problems

The symptoms can affect different areas of the body and will vary in severity from person to person.

Some people will only have minor problems, whereas others will be severely disabled.

Many people with cerebral palsy also have a number of associated problems, including repeated seizures or fits, drooling problems and difficulty swallowing.

Some people with the condition may have communication and learning difficulties, although intelligence is often unaffected. 

'A physiotherapist came to the house to try and teach her some exercises to help her walk, but she just wasn't getting it.

'But then all of a sudden Tiffany stood up next to Felicity and showed her what to do.

'Felicity copied her sister immediately, and before we knew it she had learnt to walk.

'It was amazing - even the therapists agree that watching and copying her sister has had a huge impact on her.

'We'd already started to wonder if Felicity was looking to Tiffany to teach her things, but this proved it for us.'

Since then, Felicity has continued to copy her sister, and has continued to progress well.

Mrs Williams said: 'Felicity is a little behind other children her age, but copying her sister has helped her develop.

'Felicity used to be nervous about walking on grass - as she was a little unstable already with her leg she didn't really like it, but Tiffany would hold her hand and show her what to do, and now she's fine with it.

'Felicity has learnt how to use felt tips and do jigsaws because Tiffany does them all the time, and will show her how they work.

'Even when they were learning to talk, Felicity would repeat her sister.

'Tiffany would ask us for a drink, and then before we knew it so would Felicity - it's really been incredible.'

When Tiffany and Felicity were born two and a half months early in February 2010, medics raced to keep the tiny babies alive.

After a tricky start to life, Tiffany was discharged after two months, but her twin sister faced a bigger struggle.

Mr Williams said: 'When they were born neither of the girls could breathe on their own.

'It was a really scary time as we just expected to have two healthy babies - we were shell shocked.

'After initial breathing problem, Tiffany was doing really well, whilst Felicity developed a very serious bowel condition called neonatal necrotising enterocolitis - her bowel had started to die and was spreading to her other intestines.

'We didn't know if she was going to make it, but luckily they were able to operate and save her life.

'After the operation they gave Felicity a brain scan and they noticed she had dark spots on her white brain matter.

'We had no idea what this meant but the doctors explained she'd developed periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) - a form of brain damage that can lead to cerebral palsy.

'We think she may have developed it due to the stress and trauma of her birth and operations - but we'll never know 100 per cent.

While Felicity is behind other children her age in terms of her development, she has made great progress thanks to her sister, her parents claim

'It was horrible to learn that Felicity had this, but each day she slowly got better, and six months later she was finally discharged - it was a huge relief.'

Finally at home together, Mr and Mrs Williams wondered whether their twins would ever bond after spending so much time apart.

Mrs Williams said: 'I really worried that they wouldn't be close or they wouldn't get on, because they'd basically been separated from birth, but it was exactly the opposite.

'From day one Tiffany has been a source of help and encouragement to her sister - she's like a little mother hen.'

Now, at age four, the girls are continuing to surprise their parents, and grow closer every day.

Mrs Williams said: 'They've recently started dance classes together and they love it.

'Tiffany will always find things easier than her sister, but Felicity is coming on leaps and bounds and we couldn't be prouder.

Mr Williams is now hoping to compete in the London Marathon next year in aid of Birmingham Children's hospital.

He added: 'Felicity is doing better and better each day, and she's achieving so much.

'We think that Tiffany has grown into a very compassionate child - whenever a child in her class is upset she'll always be the one to help.

'We're incredibly proud of both of our girls.'
