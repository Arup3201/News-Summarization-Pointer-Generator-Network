John Bercow faces a secret cross-party bid to boot him out as Commons Speaker next year.

MPs across the main parties are privately plotting to replace him with a new Speaker after the general election in May.

In a dramatic move, they plan to change Commons' procedure to introduce a secret ballot for any motion to sack Mr Bercow.

Under current rules, a motion to challenge the Speaker must be 'recorded' – meaning the names of all MPs who voted to remove him would be made public.

But a secret ballot would allow critics to vote him down without fear of reprisal if he survived.

One plotter said last night: 'The rule now is a huge advantage for Bercow – it makes people afraid to oppose him as if we lose, he'll know who defied him.'

It is thought MPs will try to secure a Commons' debate to get the procedure changed before Parliament is dissolved in March. They then plan to challenge Mr Bercow when the Commons reconvenes after May 7.

Mr Bercow, pictured with his wife Sally, has been Speaker of the House of Commons since June 2009

But last night, it was thought the rule change bid would fail.

One Bercow ally said: 'There is no way they will get the time to change this before the Election.

'And if they're so frightened of going public, unfortunately they'll have to come clean to call for the procedure time.'
