Graziano Pelle and Ronald Koeman have been awarded the Premier League player and manager of the month awards following Southampton's excellent start to the season. 

Koeman steered the Saints to victory in all three of their Premier League games last month, with a 4-0 win over Newcastle followed by a 1-0 away at Swansea and a 2-1 at home to QPR. 

And Pelle scored three times during September, twice against Newcastle and a stunning winner against QPR.

Four wins from four (including Capital One Cup)...

Southampton 4 - 0 Newcastle

Swansea 0 - 1 Southampton

Arsenal 1 - 2 Southampton (League Cup)

Southampton 2 - 1 QPR

Many thought it would be a difficult season for Southampton, considering the upheaval they faced over the summer, but Koeman has come in to steady the ship and prove the doubters wrong.

He follows his predecessor Mauricio Pochettino, who won the managerial gong last October, while Pelle becomes the first Southampton player to be given the award since James Beattie in November 2002.

And the 29-year-old's form was rewarded with a call-up to the Italy squad for the first time and he had a dream debut, scoring the only goal in a 1-0 victory over Malta in a Euro 2016 qualifier on Monday.

The Saints currently find themselves third in the Premier League table after seven games, one place better off - but a point worse off - than they were at the same stage of last season. They next face the visit of Sunderland on Saturday.
