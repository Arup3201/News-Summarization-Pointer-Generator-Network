Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond has reportedly ended a neighbourly dispute by buying the house next door for £1.2million.

The 44-year-old bought his six-bedroom castle near Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, in 2008, shelling out around £2million for the property, which also boasts a number of garages for his collection of classic cars.

However, the star has reportedly paid a further £1.2million for the six-bedroom house next door, following claims of a row with former neighbour Mark O'Connor.

'Dispute': The star has reportedly bought the house next door after claims of a row with former neighbour Mark O'Connor

Original house: The 44-year-old bought his six-bedroom castle near Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, in 2008, shelling out around £2million for the property

According to The Sun's Michael Hamilton, Hammond's PA paid cash for the property, which is set in 14.5 acres of gardens and grounds. 

The house, which estate agents described as 'charming' had been listed for sale at £1.25million. 

Parts of the house are said to date back to the 17th century, with many of the home's historical features having been retained, including window seats and ornate moulded architraving.

Family: Hammond and his wife Mindy, who have two daughters, moved into the mock castle, set in 20 acres of grounds, in 2008

Home: The oldest part of Hammond's first home dates from the 15th century, but the castle facade - designed to look as if it was from that period - was added around 300 years later

There are also several outbuildings, including a billiards room, garage and an old stable block.  

It is claimed that there had been arguments over animals, including ponies, and that Hammond had flown over Mr O'Connor's property in his helicopter after sending representatives to view the house and its grounds.

'It's been traumatic,' Mr O'Connor told The Sun. 

Hammond and his wife Mindy, who have two daughters, moved into the mock castle, set in 20 acres of grounds, in 2008 - the same year that he and co-star James May were awarded a pay rise for their work on Top Gear, bringing their salaries more in line with that earned by Jeremy Clarkson.

He now reportedly earns around £175,000 for a series of Top Gear, which he joined 12 years ago.

The oldest part of the building dates from the 15th century, but the castle facade - designed to look as if it was from that period - was added around 300 years later.

The owner at the time is said to have added the castle elements because he was in love with a Spanish woman who had been reluctant to live in England, and had wanted to  live in a castle - spurning him in spite of his building work.

An unnamed source close to Hammond told the newspaper: 'It was an unfortunate neighbourly dispute. But they've worked things through and are happy it's all been resolved.'
