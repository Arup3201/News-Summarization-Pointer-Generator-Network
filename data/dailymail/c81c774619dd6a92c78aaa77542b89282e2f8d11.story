Freak accident: Miles O'Brien, a former science and space correspondent for CNN, lost his left arm after developing a medical condition caused by an injury

When a heavy piece of luggage toppled onto him, hurting his forearm during a recent reporting assignment to Asia, veteran journalist Miles O’Brien was not overly concerned - it was just a nasty bruise, after all.

But what the 54-year-old independent science and aerospace reporter did not know is that the injury would ultimately cost him his left arm as a result of a potentially deadly medical condition.

In a wry blog post that appeared on his site Tuesday, Mr O'Brien, formerly a reporter for CNN, detailed his ordeal that ended on the operating table nearly two weeks ago.

Mr O'Brien, who has two children and lives with his partner in Maryland, explained that on February 12, he had concluded his extended trip to Japan and the Philippines, where he reported on three dimensional printing for a segment on PBS' NewsHour.

He was packing up his heavy recording equipment when one of his cases slipped from a bungee cord and fell onto his left forearm.

'Ouch! It hurt, but I wasn't all '911' about it,' Mr O'Brien wrote. 'Maybe a little bit of denial?'

His injured limb was painful to the touch and swollen, but O'Brien believed there was still no cause for alarm. The following night, however, the sore arm appeared to be getting worse.

The next morning, the veteran correspondent and amateur pilot rushed to a doctor.

'The look on his face when he saw my forearm got me a little more nervous,' Mr O'Brien recalled.

The physician diagnosed him with an acute compartment syndrome: a condition where excessive pressure builds up inside an enclosed space in the body as a result of bleeding or swelling after an injury.

According to WebMD, the dangerously high pressure in compartment syndrome impedes the flow of blood to and from the affected tissues.

O'Brien was admitted into a hospital, where his injured forearm became discolored and turned numb.

The treating physician recommended an emergency fasciotomy: a gruesome procedure that involves long incisions through the skin and the fascia layer underneath to release excessive pressure.

‘It was getting real,’ O’Brien wrote. ‘Of course I wasn’t awake for the action but I was told later that things tanked even further once I was on the table.’

Tough guy: O'Brien, an amateur pilot, initially didn't think his injury was serious, but when his condition worsened, he went to a doctor and was diagnosed with acute compartment syndrome - a condition that involves high pressure buildup inside the body

While under anasthesia, Mr O'Brien lost blood pressure due to complications from compartment syndrome, forcing the surgeon to amputate his arm just below the elbow.

'He later told me it all boiled down to a choice… between a life and a limb,’ O’Brien said.

O'Brien awoke in a hospital room to phantom pains from the missing limb and concerns for the future, but said that he was grateful to be alive.

‘Life is all about playing the hand that is dealt you,’ O’Brien quipped in his droll blog entry. ‘Actually, I would love somebody to deal me another hand right about now – in more ways than one.’

A Graduate of Georgetown University, O'Brien had spent 17 years of his 30-year career in the news business as a science and space correspondent for CNN.

In 2008, O’Brien left the news network and struck out on his own, producing segments for PBS, Discovery Science and National Science Foundation.
