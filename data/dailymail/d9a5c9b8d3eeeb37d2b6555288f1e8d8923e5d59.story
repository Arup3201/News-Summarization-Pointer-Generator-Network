An Australian fishing guide has captured the amazing moment a five-metre crocodile chowed down on a three-metre crocodile.

Warren Smith, who works as a fishing guide on the Tiwi Islands north of Darwin, took the amazing photographs during a fishing tour on Saturday.

'We were just out fishing, as we do, we were out the back of Snake Bay and we came across that big crocodile… and what was left of the other crocodile in his mouth,' Mr Smith told Daily Mail Australia.

Mr Smith estimates his fishing boat got within 10 metres of the crocodile feast and the tour group were amazed by the scene

Mr Smith said he estimated the bigger crocodile at five metres and the smaller one at three metres.

'But I didn't actually jump out with a tape measure. I just grabbed my camera straight away.'

Mr Smith said the crocodile was two-thirds of his way through the smaller animal when their fishing boat stumbled upon the scene and only the tail of the smaller beast could be seen hanging out of the larger croc's jaws.

Mr Smith estimates his fishing boat got within 10 metres of the crocodile feast and the tour group were amazed by the scene.

The cannibal croc devoured his younger mate to the astonishment of Mr Smith

The saltie was clearly hungry - devouring the 3m croc before moving on to his next meal

Last year Mr Smith spotted a crocodile feasting on a 300kg-400kg buffalo 

'It's not very common to see something like that… I have, probably over 20 years, seen something like this half a dozen times.'

He said that crocodiles are known to turn to cannibalism, particularly during nesting season as mother crocs defend their babies.

Last year Mr Smith also snapped pictures of a crocodile eating a 300-400kg buffalo while on a fishing trip with his brother and sons.

'The crocodile took it off like it didn't weigh a thing. That was a pretty amazing one too,' he said.
