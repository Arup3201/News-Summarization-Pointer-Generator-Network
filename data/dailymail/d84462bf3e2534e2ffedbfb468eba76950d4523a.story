As if the 'All In' title wasn't controversial enough for the David Petraeus biography written by his mistress, a news station ran a fake book cover during a broadcast - with a few unfortunate words added.

The blunder occurred during ABC's Denver affiliiate KMGH-TV's 5pm news broadcast yesterday, when the image of Paula Broadwell's All In: The Education of David Petraeus, appeared alongside a recent video of her speaking.

But the title of the book had been altered to say: 'All Up in My S*****.'

The photo pops up as one of the top images when doing a Google search of the words 'All In' and 'Broadwell,' which is likely what the editor searched for.

The photo links to DeathandTaxesmag.com, which had removed the image by Tuesday morning - but republished it later in the day.

In a story on KMGH-TV's own website, news director Jeff Harris called the incident 'a regrettable and an embarrassing error.'

He added: ‘We are mortified this appeared during our 5 p.m. news broadcast.  The editor pulled the image of the book cover from the internet without realizing it had been doctored.

The real deal: To write All In, Broadwell spent the last few years following Petraeus around and interviewing him

More than friends: As news of the infidelity scandal broke, the 'All In' title of the book has been called out as an early indication of what Petraeus and Broadwell were up to

'We sincerely regret the error and have corrected the story to avoid any recurrence of its broadcast.  We are following up internally as well to avoid a repeat of this inexcusable oversight.'

There was no mention of the editor's name, or whether he or she will be keeping their job.

As news of the story broke, the title of the book has been called out as an early indication of what Petraeus and Broadwell were up to.

Last night, Daily Show host Jon Stewart joked that the title should have been 'Who Has Two Thumbs and Is Banging His Biographer?'

It's 'All In' the title: Jon Stewart suggested an alternate name for the biography that Broadwell wrote
