Was Joachim Low's decision to send Mario Gotze on to the field in the 88th minute of the World Cup final a stroke of genius, an extraordinary piece of luck - or was it due to some rather smart wearable technology?

According to one of the German national team's performance analysts, it was the latter, with weeks and months of number crunching inspiring Gotze's introduction and his subsequent extra-time winner  against Argentina.

Speaking at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Wednesday, Darcy Norman revealed that the German national squad wore adidas' miCoach technology during training sessions before and during the World Cup in Brazil.

Small devices worn on the body monitor key performance metrics such as distance, speed, and heart rate of those who wear it.

Boots record player-specific data with an innovative miCoach Speed Cell chip placed in the cavity of the outsole, which captures 360 degree movements.

Coaches examine data to analyse where players thrive - and where they need to improve.

Heart-rate, distance, speed, sprints-per-session and durability of players had all been scrutinised in great detail in the build-up to the showdown at the Maracana.

And, due to the delicately-poised nature of the final - it was 0-0 after 88 minutes - Low turned to his bench, saw his personnel and utilised the data he had at his disposal, claims Norman.

Gotze's numbers - he was proved to be more effective during five-on-five sessions - helped Low make the decision to give him the nod.

Germany's backroom staff had done the number crunching. They had scrutinised the data. Gotze could make the difference - and so it proved.

Germany's 2014 World Cup triumph was partially inspired by their use of wearable technology

Manchester United and other professional sports teams use wearable tech to gain information

Established in1995, Prozone is player-tracking software which charts the movement of every individual on the pitch.

Using around 10 cameras, the programme creates a two-dimensional animation of the pitch and is capable of registering 3,000 touches of the ball per game.

It offers real-time, post-match and opposition analysis and now almost every Barclays Premier League team use the system.

Other sports, including rugby, have also embraced it.

But Norman, quoted on geekwire.com, explained the usefulness of professional sports teams utilising such technology.

He said: 'We quantify the training sessions to get some benchmark to then have meaningful conversations.'

Technology is also being used by Premier League clubs (most use Prozone), rugby teams and by a whole variety of top-level sports sides in order to monitor their players.

Any striker who is not pulling their weight, any defender who is not winning enough aerial battles and any midfielder who is not passing the ball as accurately as he should be will be caught out by this technology.

Arsenal and other Premier League sides monitor how their players are performing using wearable tech

Adidas director of production creation Simon Drabble said: 'There's obviously hard work, passion, tears, sweat, and a few choice words between each game - it's not all about technology.

'But there's no denying the fact that we have a great example of how technology helped train the best of the best to be No 1 in the world.'
