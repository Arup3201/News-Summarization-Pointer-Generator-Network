Confrontation: CCTV footage shows Natalie Bree Hajek-Richardson (top left) being approached by a woman who she told to 'go to hell' following a fight over a child's tantrum. Terrie Elzie has since been arrested on suspicion of felony battery causing serious injury

A child started screaming next to Natalie Bree Hajek-Richardson while she was at a Colma Nordstrom Rack, Hajek-Richardson said in an earlier interview with the news outlet.

She told KPIX 5 that she spoke to the child's mother and requested she make the child be quieter.

Hajek-Richardson told the affiliate station: 'She came to the side of me and told me not to tell her child what to do. And I told her that I didn't ask your child what to do, I asked you very nicely to calm down your child just a little bit.'

'I told her to go to hell and she told me I’ll see you there,' she also said.

Hajek-Richardson told KPIX that the woman pursued her while she walked outside the store toward her vehicle.

Face off: As the pair come together, the unidentified woman asks 'where did you tell me to go?'. Hajek-Richardson tells her again to go to hell

Tussle: They then both end up on the ground after Hajek-Richardson is twice punched in the face 

'[She] Was asking me, "Where'd you tell me to go?" So I repeated again what I said to her, and I told her that I told her to go to hell,' she told the news outlet.

KPIX reported that a woman wearing red can be seen approaching Hajek-Richardson outside the store in CCTV footage.

After coming together the woman seems to hit Hajek-Richardson and the pair fall onto the ground.

Hajek-Richardson claimed to the affiliate station she suffered two face punches.

'My teeth hurt, my elbow hurts, I got a bruise on my thigh,' she told KPIX 5.

One of Hajek-Richardson's teeth has been successfully preserved since the alleged assault, and dentists will bond two more, the affiliate station reported. 

Aftermath: Hajek-Richardson says her teeth and elbows hurt and she has a bruised thigh as a result of the attack. Police are analyzing the footage in a bid to find the attacker
