A science 
teacher who pretended she had cancer and even 
swabbed colleagues for DNA to see if they could save her life by 
donating tissue has been struck off today.

Samantha Scrine, 26, from Swansea, was banned from the classroom after claiming she was dying from a rare form of stomach cancer.

Miss Scrine took DNA swabs from her workmates pretending she needed to find out if they could donate bone marrow in a last bid save her life.

Tribunal: Samantha Scrine, 26, pretended she had a rare stomach cancer. She was struck off the teaching register today despite telling the panel 'stress' had made her think she was dying of the terminal illness

She claimed she was undergoing 
radiotherapy and was too ill to teach - and her school then arranged for
 cover at a cost of £5,500.

She even gave her school a funeral pack with a CD of songs she wanted to be played at her funeral.

But when staff at Gowerton Comprehensive School in 
Swansea, South Wales, approached her family, they revealed she was was not ill but she was suffering from depression.

She was then sacked from work in June last year before appearing at a disciplinary panel.

There Miss Scrine claimed she had 'lost her head' and stress had made her believe she was terminally ill.

The panel decided she had acted dishonestly for around nine months - and removed her from the teaching register.

She appealed to save her career by not 
being struck off. But the disciplinary panel of the General Teaching 
Council for Wales feared she may do it again.

Fantasy: Miss Scrine convinced colleagues at Gowerton Comprehensive School in Swansea, South Wales, that she had cancer for eight months. She even took DNA swabs to see if they were bone marrow matches

Panel chairman Peter Williams said: 'Miss Scrine’s behaviour was dishonest, preplanned and persistent.

'This
 was a very serious case of unacceptable professional conduct. The 
conduct was deliberate. A number of her actions must have involved 
significant preplanning.

'It was a serious abuse of colleagues which impacted on them professionally, emotionally and in their private lives.'

Mr Williams said: 'We accept she may at some point have had a mistaken belief she had cancer.

'But her behaviour was dishonest. The extensive preplanning and embellishment of her condition was deliberate.

'She poses a significant risk of repeating her dishonest behaviour.

'This behaviour is fundamentally incompatible with Miss Scrine remaining a registered teacher.'

Claims: The science teacher gave her school a 'funeral pack' with songs she wanted played at her funeral

Presenting
 officer Louise Price said: 'Miss Scrine’s behaviour impacted on the 
school and the students by denying them continuous, uninterrupted 
education.

'But
 it had the biggest effect on her colleagues, who were tearful and upset
 as well as feeling shameful and struggling to trust each other.'

Miss Scrine backed up her story by sending thousands of text messages pretending to be her own mother.

She claimed she was suffering from the effects of gallstones which led her to believe she had cancer.

Miss Scrine claimed she would go to hospital waiting rooms and take pain medication to cope with her symptoms.

She
 invented stories about her fellow hospital patients, claiming she had 
befriended a 10-year-old girl who had later died of cancer.

She admited making false statements, 
obtaining DNA swabs under false pretences and falsifying documents from 
Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board.

Earlier in the hearing, presenting officer Louise Price told the tribunal: 'She told the school she had been diagnosed with inoperable cancer.

'She
 said she had found a lump in her stomach but there was no treatment due
 to its location and she wasn't sure how much time she had to live.

'Miss Scrine said she had arranged radiotherapy for outside class time but she started to miss school due to illness.

'She claimed
 the cancer had spread to her hip and texted fellow teachers asking for a
 DNA samples to be taken to see if they were a match.

'She
 took swabs from a number of teachers and members of their family. Some 
of them received a letter from the hospital thanking them for their 
swabs.'

The hearing in Cardiff was told how teachers at the school claim they will never trust each other again.

In a statement one unnamed colleague said they couldn't believe they had been taken in by her 'attention seeking lies'.
