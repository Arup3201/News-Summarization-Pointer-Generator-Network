Alan Pardew believes Remy Cabella is the one Newcastle player capable of scoring a 'rabona' goal just like Erik Lamela.

But the Newcastle boss, who takes his side to Spurs this afternoon, insists that foreign playmakers need time to adapt to the Premier League.

Pardew said: 'We brought Remy here to produce a moment like Lamela produced last week at Spurs. Hopefully coming out of the side and giving him a little rest has given him the opportunity to understand what the Premier League is about and come back stronger. He has trained well this week.'

Lamela, meanwhile, should retain his place in the Tottenham side after his incredible goal during Spurs' 5-1 win over Asteras Tripolis in the Europa League on Thursday.

He has taken his time adjusting to life in England following his club record £30million move from Roma last summer, but he is finally starting to show his best form and says he bases a lot of his game on Barcelona's Argentina superstar Lionel Messi.

Lamela said: 'My idol is Messi. He does not score goals like that one but he is always the best — he is from a different planet.

'This goal was for my girlfriend, family and everyone at the club.'
