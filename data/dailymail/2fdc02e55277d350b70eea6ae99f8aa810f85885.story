As Lionel Messi took control of the ball in a crowded penalty area before bursting into the six-yard box and sitting the  goalkeeper on his backside with the subtlest of feints, records went tumbling again.

The Barcelona forward, as he so often does, stole the show at the Nou Camp on Sunday as Luis Enrique's side put Rayo Vallecano to the sword with a 6-1 victory that sent the Catalans to the top of La Liga.

Rivals Real Madrid were beaten by Athletic Bilbao on Saturday and Barca took full advantage as they recorded their biggest league win since the opening day of the season to take control of the title race.
