More land in Surrey is dedicated to playing golf rather than housing, new research has shown.

Prof Paul Cheshire, researcher at the Spatial Economics Research Centre at the LSE said green belts were driving up the price of houses and subsidising activities such as golf

Prof Cheshire said in London alone there was enough green belt land to build an estimated 1.6 million new homes with average densities. He said the land bank was about 32,500 hectares and could have an impact on the cost of homes in the region.

According to new research by the London School of Economics, more of Surrey is covered by golf courses, such as Camberley Heath, pictured, than housing

According to Prof Cheshire, 2.65 percent of Surrey is covered by golf courses which is greater than the area covered by housing

He said green belts cover one and a half times the area of Britain than covered by towns and cities.

According to Prof Cheshire's research, between 1969 and 1989, in excess of 4.3 million homes were built in England, compared to 2.7 million between 1994 and 2012.

He said there is currently demand for an additional 2.3 million new homes.

Speaking to The Observer, Prof Cheshire said: 'We have a longstanding and endemic crisis of housing supply and it is caused primarily by policies that intentionally constrain the supply of housing land.

'Green belts are a handsome subsidy to "horseculture" and gold. Since our planning system prevents housing competing, land for golf courses stays very cheap. More of Surrey is now under golf courses - about 2.56 percent - than has houses on it.

'What green belts really seem to be is a very British form of discriminatory zoning, keeping the urban unwashed out of the home counties - and, of course, helping to turn houses into investment assets instead of places to live.'

According to Prof Cheshire's research many of the new homes being built in England are not in the areas where there is the most demand - such as London and the south east.

He said continued Government policies have seen houses turned from places to live into valuable assets.
