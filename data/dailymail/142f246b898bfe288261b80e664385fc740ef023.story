From a young age, Sally Cudmore knew she had a sixth sense.

But it was only when she began training as a nurse five years ago that the 43-year-old realised how far her supernatural abilities stretched. 

The mother-of-three, from Blackheath in London, claims she started seeing visions of the future while working on a special care ward - and ended up giving up her nursing career to answer her calling as a medium. 

When patients were dangerously ill at Lewisham hospital where she worked, she would see red and black surrounding them, indicating their death was imminent. 

And after just a year, she gave up her career to pursue her gift and bring comfort to grieving relatives. 

Sally Cudmore, 43, says she was plagued with supernatural visions while working as a nurse in Lewisham 

Sally says she began to see the spirit of a young girl when she was eight but she pushed her psychic abilities to the back of her mind. 

When Sally began training as a nurse, she said she was unable to shut herself off from the spirit world.  

'As a trainee nurse I quickly got used to death and I cared for people in their final days,' she said. 

'But it was the spirits coming back that I wasn't ready for. Life in a hospital was harder than I could have imagined.  

'I trained on a special care ward in Lewisham Hospital where patients were dangerously ill and I started to see events of the future before they happened in my head.

'I knew someone was going to die when I saw red and black surrounding them and it became really upsetting.

Sally,  left, as a baby, and right, aged six and dressed as a nurse, gave up her career to become a medium 

'There was one occasion where a patient's family were all remarking how well she looked and how they thought she was getting better.

'I saw the red and black surrounding her and within the hour she was dead. I'm only human and it does get to you - especially when it's children.'

But while her visions showed her tragedy, she also found that she could use her powers to bring comfort to grieving relatives and often approaches strangers to pass on messages.

'I would see family members that would be coming for their loved ones. I was able to pass on messages and comfort people in their grief.

Sally, pictured at seven, says she knew she was psychic from a young age when she began to see spirits 

'That was when I started to realise that I had a gift and I should use it to help people.'

'I've done it so many times. I've been in Asda or Sainsburys and if I've seen a spirit there I have to give the message.

'Sometimes people are a little bit apprehensive when I approach them but once they hear the accuracy of the message they are usually really grateful.

'I feel like I have a duty to comfort people who are grieving.'

After just a year of nursing training, Sally said she 'felt like she had no choice' but to accept her calling.

In 2011, she helped the police find an elderly woman with dementia who had been missing for four nights.

Sally said she pointed to where the woman was on a map and police officers tracked her down. 

'I felt a strong connection with her and I knew that she was alive, but if she wasn't found she would be dead within 24 hours.

'I pointed out where I thought she was on the map and the police found her in an allotment. She had been sleeping on the ground for days with no food and water.

'The doctors said she was three hours from death. If I hadn't connected with her she would have died - I saved her life.'

But not all of the reaction is positive and she is now more wary about what she reveals in her readings.

She said: 'I saw a triangle when I spoke to one lady. I said to her, 'I can see you, a man and another woman'.

'She told me that she knew her partner was having an affair and when I gave her the other woman's name she confirmed it.

'But later I got a phone call from her partner and he was furious and demanding how I knew the information.

'It came out later that he was having an affair and I'd confirmed his girlfriend's suspicions.

'I'm a lot more wary with that sort of thing now.'
