A disrespectful remark caused the fist fight that led to the fatal shooting of famed LA tattoo artist Trigz in Los Angeles, claims the manager of the store where the lethal brawl broke out.

According to the manager, Trigz, whose real name is Michael Christopher Pebley, was minding his own business in the Black Derby Smoke Shop on Thursday afternoon when an apparent stranger upset him with a pointed remark leaving the store.

Pebley, who was sitting talking to the store owner, was angered and approached the man, 'getting in his face', which sparked a 30 second fight inside, which eventually spilled onto the sidewalk and ended with Pebley being fatally shot outside the neighboring Tattoo & Body Piercing parlor.

'The suspect was already shopping inside when Pebley walked in and sat down to talk to the owner,' said manager, James Mayen, who has also watched the security footage of the fight from Thursday.

'The suspect is making his way out of the store when he turns to Pebley and says something, which makes Pebley leave his chair and walk straight over to him.

'He gets in his face and the two begin arguing, which quickly descends into a huge fight inside, which then spills outside.'

The witness, who was not at the store during the fight, said that according to those who were, shots rang out and the suspect fled in a four-door white Honda Accord.

Asked what could have sparked such a violent and ultimately fatal fight, the witness said that he had been told the suspect turned to Pebley and asked him 'Where do I know you from?'

'That might may sound like nothing, but round here the way you say that could be the difference to starting a fight or not,' said Mayen.

Police have said they do not know what the argument was about and are asking for anyone with information on the shooting to call the authorities. 

Tragic: Michael Christopher Pebley - or Trigz - leaves behind five children, including a young daughter Vida (pictured) and a fiancée

Witness Brandon Wilmot, 22, a security officer for Valley Plaza was working opposite the shop when the shooting took place.

‘He got shot but nobody heard any of the gunshots or anything. The cops and ambulance came up and they were trying to revive him for about five minutes, then they ended up just pulling the white sheet over him,' said Wilmot.

'When I walked down the street I could see the sheet over him and see his feet sticking out.

'He was a known local person and a good guy. When the cops came the people out of the tattoo shop came out and they were hysterical. A lot of his apprentices work at that tattoo parlour.'

Pebley's friend, actor, Carlos Ayala, 35, said that it was 'probably fear that got Trigz killed.'

They got into a fight and nowadays someone can’t just take an ass whupping - they have to pull out a gun.

‘They should just take their ass whupping and y’know, “see ya another day,” why pull out a gun?

‘Violence is going to be everywhere it doesn’t have to be gang violence or whatever. People pull out guns because they’re intimidated.

‘I worked with him on many videos. I’ve known him since 2002, we did SWAT together and the video for Rick Ross’ Don’t Play No Games with Future.

‘Just because he looks how he looks people shouldn’t judge. He was a real nice guy.'

The famed tattoo artist worked with Chris Brown, Kylie Jenner's reported boyfriend Tyga as well as Amber Rose's soon-to-be-ex Wiz Khalifa and musician Travis Barker.

'He was a really good guy,' said friend Desirae Howell to NBC Los Angeles.. 'He was a family guy. He was very intelligent.'

Just after news broke of the murder, which is believed to have taken place at 5:50 pm, Brown tweeted, 'RIP homie. S*** it crazy!'

Only hours after the fatal shooting, friends, family and mourners put together a makeshift memorial for Pebley outside the shop. 

The artist and an unidentified man were believed to have had a verbal altercation before the gun was fired.

Trigz was a famed tattoo and graffiti artist, actor and model. He also became part of an exclusive worldwide group of artists called The Seventh Letter, fellow member and friend Willie T told Eyewitness News.

Police told TMZ the shooting took place in front of the Black Derby Smoke Shop, which sells glass blown pipes. 

The suspect was described as a Hispanic male in his thirties. He left the scene of the crime in a white, early nineties Honda Accord, according to the Los Angeles Police Department. 

A witness told ABC Los Angeles that approximately four gunshots were heard before Trigz's body was found.

The LAPD confirmed Trigz died at the scene. A witness says he heard four gunshots overall.

Trigz left behind five children, three daughters and a son.

He was often used as a model in music videos and in magazine shoots and was a member of the renowned Seventh Letter graffiti artist crew. 

Trigz, a.k.a. Mr. Trigger, worked out of Sincity Tattoo in Pacoima, where he specialized in body piercing.

Trigz’s son has started a GoFundMe account to help pay for his funeral expenses. 

Pebley's two sons, Michael and Anthony both expressed their pain at the death of their father by posting a picture of them both sitting on his knee dating from 1997.

In a Facebook message, Anthony said that he was 'gonna miss' his father and 'we had a lot of s**t I wish we could have worked out before this. I love you.'

Michael, who has set up a GoFundMe page was equally distraught, asking friends, family and members of the public to help donate money for his father's funeral.

Despite the glowing tributes paid by friends, the veteran tattoo artist was known for his checkered history with the law.

As recently as 2009, Pebley, or Trigz, was incarcerated in Ironwood State Prison in Blythe serving a six year sentence for graffiti.

He was arrested on 12 counts of vandalism and while he only served around 18 months, the prison sentence was seen as harsh nonetheless.

Speaking to local media about his time in jail, Pebley said that prison was as good as could be expected.

'I've got some cool homies who have stayed tough for me on the streets which helps a villain keep my head high and my eyes open in this shark tank,' said Pebley.

He also touched on his body art being a source of prejudice and claimed that he was dealt with differently by the courts because of them.
