Fernando Torres insists he has a good relationship with Jose Mourinho and bears no grudges towards the Chelsea manager. 

Torres signed a two-year loan deal with AC Milan on Sunday to bring an end to his frustrating Chelsea career. 

The 30-year-old - signed for a then British transfer record of £50million in 2011 - had fallen out of favour with Mourinho and was left out of the club's opening three Premier League games after the arrivals of Diego Costa and Didier Drogba at Stamford Bridge.

Worlds apart: Jose Mourinho did not play Fernando Torres in any of Chelsea's Premier League games

'I had a very good relationship with Jose. When I was signed by Milan he wished me all the best,' Torres told The Evening Standard. 

'He spoke about the passion that the city of Milan has for football and that I would settle in well. I learnt a lot from him as a coach. I wish him all the best, as he has done with me.

'Perhaps in the future our paths will meet again. I don't need to say anything else. We have to always act and play as professionals.'
