Given the choice between hanging out with Aziz Ansari during the comedian's recent trip to Washington, D.C. and a round of golf, President Barack Obama chose  golf after the actor and comedian was already at the White House waiting for him.

Ansari talked about the high-level 'dis' in a radio interview earlier this week with Howard Stern, noting that Obama was the one who suggested they get together when he was in town.

But when he got to the White House, the president was no where to be found. A White House official giving him a tour of the building claimed Obama had 'national security' meetings, yet Ansari says he overheard a Secret Service member talking about Obama playing golf.

'So I got dissed by Obama,' Ansari told Stern, according to the Daily Caller.

Aziz Ansari  is pictured here arriving at Late Show With David Letterman Show in New York City on Oct. 6. That same day, Ansari told radio host Howard Stern that Obama blew him off for golf when he visited Washington, D.C. last month

Ansari performed in Washington, D.C. at the Verizon Center on Saturday, September 27.

According to the White House pool report from that day, Obama did in fact play golf that afternoon - his 194th game since taking office.

In his conversation with Stern on Oct. 6, Ansari, an Obama supporter who performed at a fundraiser for the president's reelection campaign in 2012, described his disappointing trip to the White House in detail.

'Two weekends ago I went to do a show in D.C. I was doing the Verizon Center. I was very excited,' Ansari told Stern. 

'And we got an email saying, like, "hey, you know, do you want to come do a tour of the White House. Like, the POTUS is a big fan. Would love to say hi if he’s around." And so I was like, "yea, I’ll go do a tour. It would be great to say, like, hi to him again." '

'And so I go and, you know, dress up in my suit and stuff,' Ansari said. 

When he arrived at the White House Ansari says he was informed the president may not be able to meet with him after all.

'The guy showing us a round – nicest guy – is like, "look, we are going to try to get you in to see the president. He has got a lot of meetings today. Like, he’s got a lot of national security stuff. But, you know, we are going to try to do it."

'I’m like, "aright great. Totally fine," ' Ansari recalled.

'So we are like walking around. We are just trying to stay there for a long time to increase our odds of like actually [seeing Obama],' he said 

After 'waiting and waiting,' Ansari said he heard 'another Secret Service guy, like, walk by and was like, "alright, let’s do it. POTUS wants to play golf." '

'And I was like, "WHAT? He’s going to go play golf? I thought he was a big fan; he wanted to say hi to me?" 'Ansari exclaimed. ' "There’s no national security meeting. He’s going to play golf." '

Ansari and the president had met once before at the fundraiser the Parks and Recreation star headlined for Obama's reelection campaign in March of 2012.

Speaking about the encounter on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon a few weeks later, Ansari said Obama surprised him by coming back stage to chat afterward.

Ansari told Fallon the president waltzed up to him and said: 'Aziz, what's going on? You blowin' up, man! What're you up to?'

'And I was like, huh? Why are you talking to me like my little brother Aniz? Don't you have the nuclear codes?' Ansari said. 

Even though the president teased him about having more twitter followers during his opening remarks at the fundraiser, Ansari recalled their meeting positively during his appearance on Late Night.

'This dude acts the exact same way I could act if I was president,' he proclaimed.
