Dead: Craig Hepburn, 19, died in hospital after he was found in Marsden, near Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, in the early hours of Saturday

Two men have been charged with murder after a teenager was stabbed to death in a village street.

Craig Hepburn, 19, died in hospital after he was found in Marsden, near Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, in the early hours of Saturday.

An 18-year-old man was also taken to hospital with stab wounds.

A West Yorkshire Police spokesman said a 36-year-old man and a 21-year-old man had been charged with murder and attempted murder.

They will appear before Huddersfield Magistrates' Court this morning.

Officers were called to an incident in the Manchester Road, Town Gate, Old Mount Road area of Marsden shortly after midnight on Saturday.

They found Mr Hepburn and the 18-year-old, both from Renfrewshire, Scotland, who had both been stabbed.

The pair were taken to Huddersfield Royal Infirmary, where Mr Hepburn later died from his injuries.

The police spokesman said: 'Two men, aged 36 and 21 years, have been charged with murder and attempted murder and will appear before Huddersfield Magistrates tomorrow morning.'

The Scottish teenagers had spent the 
evening in good spirits, playing the bagpipes and making friends in pubs
in Marsden, West Yorkshire.

They were visiting Mr Hepburn’s uncle and were about 300 yards from his house when they were apparently attacked.

Mr
Hepburn suffered ‘multiple’ stab wounds and collapsed dying on the 
pavement. His male friend, who was also stabbed, managed to stagger back
to the house and raise the alarm.

The pair were taken to Huddersfield Royal Infirmary, where Mr Hepburn died.

His friend was undergoing surgery at the hospital yesterday. Although he lost a lot of blood, police said he was not suffering from life-threatening injuries.

The teenager, who has not been named, was able to say a few words, but police have been unable to take a detailed statement from him.

Detectives remain baffled by the horrific incident.

Mr Hepburn and his friend were described as ‘jolly lads’. Eyewitnesses said they had been drinking in three bars in the village centre, but they were good-natured all evening and caused no trouble.

One of the teenagers was wearing a 
Manchester City shirt, but the detective leading the murder inquiry said
this was not believed to be a factor in the attack.

Investigation: Police carry out a search through woodland following the horrific attack

The teenagers were set upon near a graveyard around midnight on Friday. Police were alerted by a 999 call to paramedics.

Detective Superintendent Paul Taylor, of West Yorkshire Police, said: ‘What happened is still a secret which lies between whoever did this, the dead man, and the man now in surgery who we cannot speak to.

‘The two victims are friends who were both down from Scotland visiting relatives and staying in the village for a few days.

‘They were having a night out in the village and it looks as if there was a confrontation in the street.

‘They had enjoyed the night and were making their way back to the relatives’ house where they were staying.

‘They were just a couple of lads enjoying a night out.

‘The weapon was a knife but we have not found it yet and there may be more than one.

‘It is unlikely they knew their attackers because they did not know anyone else in the village.’

Mr Hepburn’s parents travelled down 
from their home in Renfrewshire and were staying with his uncle Scott 
Hepburn, who refused to comment yesterday.

Police have appealed for witnesses and are trying to establish precisely where the teenagers were attacked and why.

Mr
Taylor said: ‘Marsden is a close-knit community and if anyone hears any
rumours about what has happened then I would ask them to get in touch.’

Hospitalised: The murdered teenager's friend was taken to Huddersfield General Infirmary where he is in intensive care

A local man who was drinking in a bar with Mr Hepburn and his friend shortly before the incident said they were ‘very well behaved’.

He added: ‘I was chatting to the older lad and he put his arm around me. They were just having a good time and were good fun.

‘One of them played the bagpipes in the pub next door. This is a beautiful, peaceful village and it’s a shock that something like this has happened.

‘I don’t think these two would have done anything to provoke an attack – they were not like that – although they were a bit drunk.’

Local resident Gordon Stokes added: ‘From what I know, they were doing nothing wrong. They seemed well behaved and seemed really friendly.

‘They were not violent towards anyone and were just having a good time.’

Marsden, which has a population of 4,400, is surrounded by stunning Pennine countryside and is a popular commuter village.
