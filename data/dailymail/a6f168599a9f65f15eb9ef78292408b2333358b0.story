A little boy given just days to live when he was born four months prematurely is starting school today.

Owen Piper weighed just 1lb 9oz when he was born and his head was a small as an egg.

His parents, Hayley and Craig, were told he was unlikely to survive for more than 72 hours.

Owen Piper (pictured with his mother, Hayley Piper, 29) was born four months prematurely weighing just 1lb 9oz. His parents were told that he would probably not survive for more than a few days

But after 17 weeks in intensive care he pulled through and has now started at St George’s Primary School in Sheerness, Kent.

The only noticeable difference between four-year-old Owen and the other children in the playground is his oversized uniform - the smallest available - as he is still catching up with his growth.

Ms Piper, 29, from Minster, Kent, said: ‘Owen is so excited about school - every day he asked me “is it school yet mummy?”

‘He’s such an inspiration to me - I look at him every day and think he’s gone through so much already, but he’s just not fazed by anything.

‘It was the deepest, darkest time of my life when Owen was in hospital.

‘The only way to describe what we went through is that it was like being on a rollercoaster.

Owen (pictured shortly after his birth) spent 17 weeks in intensive care after his birth in July 2009. He was eventually discharged on November 2 - the day after his due date

Owen has now started at St George's Primary School in Sheerness, Kent. He is still smaller than his peers and has lung disease but he is expected to fully recover by the time he is seven

‘One day Owen would be doing really well and the next he would be at death’s door.

‘He’s come on leaps and bounds and he’s a proper little character. His talking is just phenomenal - he’s a real chatterbox.

‘I never in a million years thought he would go to a mainstream school, I always thought he’d be behind in something.’

Owen was born at Medway Maritime Hospital on July 10, 2009, and finally allowed home on November 2, the day after his due date.

When Owen was born he was so small that his head was only as big as an egg. His first woolly hat is pictured on an egg cup

He remained on oxygen for six months and still suffers from chronic lung disease, but doctors say that this problem should clear up by the time he is seven.

The toddler has now been officially signed off by Medway Maritime Hospital and last winter was the first he did not have to be admitted to hospital after becoming unwell.

Office manager Ms Piper and alarm technician Craig, 31, are on the fundraising committee for the Oliver Fisher Trust which supports the neonatal unit that treated Owen.
