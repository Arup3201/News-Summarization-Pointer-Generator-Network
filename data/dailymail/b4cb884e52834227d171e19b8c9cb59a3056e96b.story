A family were forced to flee a packed holiday beach after thousands of bees swarmed inside their tent.

Sunbathers took cover after the huge crowd of insects swooped on Porthmeor beach in St Ives, Cornwall.

The estimated 10,000-strong swarm descended on a small sun tent and massed inside while the occupants scurried to safety.

A family were forced to abandon their beach tent after a huge swarm of bees descended on it

The swarm was estimated to be about 2,000 strong as it swept across Porthmeor beach at St Ives in Cornwall

Sunbathers scattered while photographer Nick Pumphrey was on hand to capture the action

Lifeguards cordoned off the area and called in a beekeeper to collect the insects.

The swarm was captured by surfing photographer Nick Pumphrey, who was on the beach to photograph a surf group in action but found himself among the many visitors forced to leave the area.

Mr Pumphrey, 36, said: ‘I’d just uploaded some pictures to my website and had gone for a lie down on the beach when I heard a bit of a commotion.

‘I looked up and at first thought they were flies but they realised they were either wasps or bees.

Experienced beekeeper Mike Leverton was called to assist lifeguards in collecting the insects

Mr Leverton from nearby village Lelant, swept the queen bee into a beekeepers box and waited for the swarm

It took about four hours for the whole swarm of bees to migrate into the box

‘It was a bit frightening, they were about two feet above my head and were settling on the tent which was right next to us. I pretty much crawled out of there and then ran.’

Experienced beekeeper Mike Leverton, from nearby village Lelant, said he found as many as 10,000 bees buzzing around inside the abandoned beach tent.

The retired fireman, 69, collected the swarm in a box before taking them to his home where he has around 60 hives and makes Cornish honey.

He said: 'There was a good size swarm, probably between eight and ten thousand bees.

'When I got there the lifeguards had cordoned off the area of the beach. I scraped half of them into the box and then left the box in the tent for a few hours.

'The queen must have been in the box as when I returned a few hours later all the bees had gone in - they would have followed her scent.'

Mr Leverton added: 'I presume the queen bee would have been tired for them to have all stopped on the tent.

'I've never been called to the beach to collect bees before, it's very rare.'

Authorities said nobody was stung in the incident, which happened at about 1pm on Sunday.

Beachgoer Nick Pumphrey initially thought the swarm of bees was a group of flies

The beach in St Ives was packed with holidaymakers making the most of the sunshine on Sunday

Spectators escaped without being stung as they watched the beekeeper collect the swarm
