Tragedy: Charlotte Shaw, 14, drowned after trying to cross a swollen brook during the gruelling Ten Tors expedition in 2007

A 'well-meaning' scoutmaster has been blamed for the death of a 14-year-old girl who was swept away and drowned while crossing a swollen Dartmoor brook.

Charlotte Shaw was carried off to her death while trying to help a friend over the crossing during the gruelling Ten Tors outdoor expedition.

A language teacher supervising the private school group had advised Charlotte and her friends not to attempt the swollen crossing around Walla Brook in Dartmoor, as the girls were battling against wind, rain, hail, and exhaustion.

But a court heard yesterday that scoutmaster Trevor Wills countermanded the teacher's advice and told the shivering girls to cross, as he feared they were getting hypothermia.

When Charlotte attempted to help friend Yasmin Moore across the brook, she was carried away and drowned, London's High Court heard.

Her mother, Jennifer Wilkin-Shaw, blamed her private school at London's High Court, saying in a £350,000 damages claim that the language teacher supervising the teenagers was simply not up to the job.

However, top judge, Mr Justice Owen, yesterday cleared the teacher, Christopher Fuller, and the school of all blame for the March 2007 tragedy.

The judge instead ruled that responsibility lay with a kindly scout master Mr Wills, who has since died, who tried to help the exhausted youngsters.

Mrs Wilkin-Shaw's barrister, Dr Michael Powers QC, had told the court Mr Fuller had no formal outdoor leadership qualifications and accused him of 'incompetence'.

But Mr Justice Owen said he had done 
the right thing when he told the pupil who led the group, Charlotte 
Kennedy, not to attempt a crossing of Walla Brook.

Cleared: A High Court judge refused to lay any blame for the tragedy on teacher Christopher Fuller, who had told the students not to cross the swollen brook

That
instruction, given over a mobile phone, was countermanded by scout 
master, Trevor Wills, who had encountered the bedraggled children at 
Watern Tor.

Mr Justice Owen said: 'This tragic accident was the consequence of the well meant, but ill-advised, intervention of Mr Wills.'

Although it was foreseeable that the children might seek an adult's advice after failing to meet up with teachers at the Tor, the judge said it could not have been predicted that Mr Wills, who has since died, 'would give bad advice thereby putting the group at risk'.

In foul conditions, the group of 11 children, all pupils at independent prepatory school, Edgehill College, since re-named Kingsley School, in Bideford, Devon, had set out alone on the gruelling leg of the Ten Tors route to Watern Tor unaccompanied.

Two teachers, who had been told to meet the children there, lost their way en route, but the judge said their 'navigational error' did not mean they were incompetent.

As the children waited shivering at the Tor for an adult to arrive, Mr Wills, came to their aid.

Seeing the children in a distressed state, and fearing that hypothermia might set in, he advised them not to wait around and directed then across the brook.

Exhausting: Charlotte was one of 11 students who had tackled the Ten Tors Expedition

Endurance: A High Court judge yesterday said the tough two-day Ten Tors expedition still has 'great social value' for youngsters

The judge said that 'bad advice' countermanded the instruction Mr Fuller had given to Charlotte Kennedy on her mobile phone that the party was not to attempt a crossing, but should make its way around the head of the brook to Hangingstone Hill.

That instruction was 'entirely appropriate', said the judge, who added that, although the children were 'cold, wet and miserable', they would have been capable of continuing with their treck.

Even had Mr Fuller, or the school, been found negligent, the judge said he would have found that Mr Wills' intervention 'unquestionably amounted to an independent supervening cause' of the tragedy.

After the accident, the rest of the party was evacuated from the moor by helicopter.

Dr Powers had earlier told the court: 'The rain was heavy and it was hailing. A number of the children fell into bogs and became drenched'.

Whilst recognising the 'great social value' of the Ten Tors, and saying that Mrs Wilkin Shaw 'would be the last to see any step taken which would diminish the benefit to young people of this activity', he argued the children had been exposed to unacceptable risk.

'The expedition is supposed to be a challenge - not a survival exercise,' he said.

However - after a case which is estimated to have run up lawyers' bills of at least £500,000 - Mr Justice Owen rejected claims that the children should have been accompanied, or at least 'shadowed', by a competent adult on their way to the Tor.

Had Mrs Wilkin-Shaw won the case, she would have been entitled to £350,000 damages on behalf of her daughter's estate.
