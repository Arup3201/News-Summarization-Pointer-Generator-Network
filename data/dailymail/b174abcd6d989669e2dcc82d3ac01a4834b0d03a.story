Everton could land a glamour tie with Inter Milan, Ajax or Roma in Friday's draw for the Europa League round of 16.

Roberto Martinez's men booked their place in the draw after completing a 7-2 mauling of Young Boys at Goodison Park.

The open draw in Switzerland, due to start at midday, has no seeding and no country protection.

Everton were the only British club to make it through after Liverpool, Tottenham and Celtic all crashed out on Thursday night.

Italy has five representatives in the last 16, while two Spanish clubs remain, including defending champions Sevilla.

Everton boss Roberto Martinez will discover his next test in Europe on Friday

The first club drawn are to play their first match at home against the second side drawn; the same procedure is then repeated for the other matches. Ties are to be played on March 12 and 19. 

A lucrative place in the Champions League next season is on offer to the team which lifts the trophy in Warsaw on May 27.
