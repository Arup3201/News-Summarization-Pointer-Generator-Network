A former Marine has been banned from his daughter’s school in Maryland after he took issue with her homework assignment on Islam.

Kevin Woods was angered after he found his daughter, an 11th grade student at La Plata High School, had been given a three page exercise last Wednesday that examined Islam’s five pillars.

Woods and his wife Melissa asked the school to give their daughter an alternative assignment, but were told that she either do the assignment or receive a zero grade.

‘We’re not teaching religion, we’re teaching world history,’ school spokesperson Katie O’Malley-Simpson told Fox News.

She alleges that Wood was threatening to cause a disruption, which is why he was issued a no-trespass order last Thursday after a telephone call with the school’s vice principal Shannon Morris.

‘I told her straight up “you could take that Muslim-loving piece of paper and shove it up your white a**,’” Kevin Wood told SoMd. 

‘If [students] can’t practice Christianity in school, they should not be allowed to practice Islam in school.’

Wood, a former corporal with the U.S. Marine Corps, where he was enlisted for eight years, denies that he had issued any threats.

In a later phone call with Morris, Kevin Wood said he blasted the school for violating his daughter’s ‘constitutional rights’ and said he would contact the media and ‘bring a s*** storm down on them like they’ve never seen.’

‘My husband’s issues, and mine too, are that they’re teaching Islam, but they are not teaching the current events on Islam,'  Melissa Woods told Yahoo Parenting.

'They are making Islam sound like [its followers] are peaceful people... He is not saying all Muslims are bad.’

The Woods are scheduled to meet soon with the Board of Education and the school principal to try and resolve their differences. If they can’t, they say their daughter won’t do the assignment and will take the ‘F.’

World History is one of three social studies classes, along with American History and U.S. Government, required for graduation under Maryland standards.

'I want to take this further, because I feel like if they don’t take it out of the curriculum, parents should at least have the authority to say if they want their kids to participate,' said Melissa Woods. 

'There should be alternative assignments to this.'

Wood received this trespass order informing him that he can't go on school property at La Plata High
