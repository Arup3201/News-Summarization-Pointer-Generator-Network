Giving whole new meaning to the term rabid fan, a University of Alabama football devotee dyed and groomed her standard poodle in honor of the Crimson Tide.

Oona is in perfectly good health, of course, but she and owner Amy ‘Bullet’ Brown have proven their love of the Tuscaloosa university’s revered athletes by literally writing out the team name in their signature red and white on the dog’s fur.

In fluffy white letters across her side and back--and bright crimson everywhere else--Oona was the walking, breathing, and barking embodiment of ‘Bama pride.

‘Oona loves the attention,’ Brown told WBRC.

Ooma was in safe hands. Brown is the president of an organized group of creative dog grooming enthusiasts.

The National Association of Professional Creative Groomers has members worldwide, Brown said, and all of them are focused on the health of the animals ahead of the novelty, no matter how cute, of a colorful pet.

‘Our first priority is always the safety of the pet. There is no groom that is worth the health and safety of the pet,’ Brown said.

Creative groomers like Brown use only pet safe dyes and Oona stayed in her Bama uniform for just one day.

But during that day, Oona put her unique look to good use. She and Brown traveled to an area shelter and Oona posed with people in photos for a donation towards the homeless animals.

‘She loves the attention whether she's in color or not, but of course the color draws more attention which makes her a happier girl,’ Brown said.
