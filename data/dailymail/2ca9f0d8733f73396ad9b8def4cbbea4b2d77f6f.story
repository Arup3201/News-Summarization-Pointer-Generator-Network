Angela Patram, 37, gave birth to her fifth child last month and just minutes later, she became a grandmother too. 

The Florida mother and her 20-year-old daughter Teranisha Billups gave birth on the same day last month, in the same hospital where Patram also works as a nurse. 

'We knew our due dates were around the same time, but we never expected that it would happen on the same day,' Patram told People magazine.

'I'm kinda shocked that it played out how it did,' Billups told WTSP. 

What are the odds? Angela Patram, left, gave birth to daughter Raya, in pink, on the same day that her 20-year-old daughter Teranisha Billups, right, gave birth to son Jerry Michaud Jr, in blue, last month in Tampa. Pictured above with Dr Atef Zakhary, who delivered both babies 

Patram was the first to give birth on February 19 at Tampa General Hospital, welcoming daughter Rayna into the world at 6:29pm. 

Older daughter Billups had been in labor since the day before, but she didn't give birth to son Jerry Michaud Jr until 34 minutes after Patram. 

Dr Atef Zakhary delivered both babies, as well as two of Patram's older children, and described it as a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

'I've been in this field for 29 years ... I've seen maybe 14,000 deliveries,' Dr. Zakhary said in a statement on the hospital's website. 'I've never seen a mom and daughter deliver on the same day. And this is as close as you could get.'

While Patram is sad she couldn't be with her daughter for the delivery, and be the first to see her new grandson, the mother daughter duo took pictures shortly after they were both rested from delivery. 

Double the fun: Patram says they knew their due dates were close, but never imagined giving birth on the same day. Pictured above with Angela's son CJ, center

Extraordinary: Dr Zakhary says he's never seen a mother and daughter give birth on the same day in his 29 years delivering babies

With them to mark the occasion was the Patram's other children Angelique, 14; Alicia, 13; and CJ, 4. 

Billups partner Jerry Michaud Sr and baby Rayna's father were also in attendance on the happy occasion. 

Patram's mother was frantically running between rooms to make sure both her daughter and granddaughter were supported through the birth.

One month after delivery, both babies are doing well and living at Patram's home in Gibsonton, Florida. 

'When we sit both babies next to each other, they just look at each other really closely,' Billups said. "It's weird seeing two babies of the same size in the house."

Billups and Michaud are currently living with her mother while they search for a home of their own nearby. 

Billups studies biology at Florida A&M University, but plans to transfer to a college closer to home.
