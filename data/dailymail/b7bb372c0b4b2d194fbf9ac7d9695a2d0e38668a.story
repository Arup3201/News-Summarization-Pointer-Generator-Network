As new manager Dave Hockaday sets about his new job in charge at Leeds United, the club’s fitness staff have reverted to a more old-fashioned approach in a bid to get their players up to speed ahead of the new season.  

Hockaday and his players are based in Northern Italy for the club’s pre-season training camp and in the absence of modern and innovative ice baths, Leeds’ players took a dip in the river to cool off and aid their recovery after a gruelling day.  

Strength and conditioning coach Matt Pears told the club’s official website: ‘Recovery is key during intense training periods. Cold water immersion helps reduce inflammation in the body.

'During training players pick up small micro tremors and the cold water acts to decrease the inflammation.

‘When the players exit the water they will have a rush of blood delivering oxygen to the muscle groups that need replenishing.

'The water temperature is six degrees whereas a normal ice bath is between eight and 11 degrees.’

Leeds are staying at Santa Cristina where they will play two matches next week before stepping up their training with a trip to Northern Ireland at the end of July.

Meanwhile, Leeds remain determined to keep hold of striker Ross McCormack after the forward handed in a transfer request last month.

McCormack is an £8million target for Fulham but Leeds issued a statement on Friday indicating their desire to retain his services.

It read: ‘Leeds United owner Massimo Cellino and the club would like to respond to recent media speculation regarding Ross McCormack.

‘We would like to reiterate our desire to keep Ross McCormack at Leeds United. This desire includes keeping all of our best players as we look to build a stronger and successful squad for the 2014/15 Championship season.

‘Leeds United may not be the richest club in the Championship, but we do not need to sell our best players in order to run the club successfully.’

West Ham have previously attempted to sign the striker, while Newcastle and Norwich have also been credited with an interest.
