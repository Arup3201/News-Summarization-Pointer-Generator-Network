A Hungarian man who sliced off one of his arms managed to drive 10 miles (15 kilometres) to hospital.

The 37-year-old, known as Tibor A, sliced his arm off below the elbow in an accident while cleaning a machine that processes construction rubble.

But he managed to retrieve his arm and drive through Austria clutching the severed limb.

The horrific accident happened on Sunday in Purbach in eastern Austria.

His arm was successfully reattached by plastic surgeons at Vienna's hospital AKH. 

He managed to operate his car and sped to the casualty department in nearby Eisenstadt, reported AFP.

Police said the only reason the Hungarian did not bleed to death was that he was in a state of shock.

He was airlifted to hospital in Vienna where doctors were trying to stitch the limb back on.
