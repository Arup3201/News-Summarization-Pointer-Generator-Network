A chef was killed by a single punch in a takeaway when he intervened in a trivial dispute over cheesy chips, a court heard today.

Ricky Guest-Binns, 44, suffered a fatal bleed to the brain after he was felled by a blow to the side of his head from roofer Allan Glenny, 24, at the shop in Blackpool.

Glenny had complained to staff they had not melted cheese properly on a portion of chips he had ordered for his girlfriend and then exchanged words with several customers.

His victim is thought to have been ushering him out of the premises in the early hours of May 5 when Glenny turned around and swung a punch at him.

Glenny was today jailed at Preston Crown Court for three years and four months after admitting manslaughter at a previous hearing.

The court was told the defendant hit another man in similar fashion moments later outside the Chicken Express takeaway in Caunce Street.

His second victim, Daniel Rourke, was part of a group who were attempting to capture Glenny on their mobile phone cameras after he made off following the attack on Mr Guest-Binns.

The defendant was given an extra two months in prison for the admitted common assault of Mr Rourke.

Glenny, of Blackpool, handed himself into police the same day of the incidents and admitted he was the culprit.

He confessed he drank 'quite a lot of lager', together with a number of spirits and also consumed a small amount of cocaine.

Joseph Allman, prosecuting, said Glenny told police: 'I have ruined my life and some family over one punch. A few words have been exchanged and it’s just Blackpool, Friday night.'

Mr Allman said: 'It is the prosecution’s case that Mr Guest-Binns did not do anything that could have provoked the assault upon him.

'It is appalling this incident should have happened over whether cheese had been melted on the defendant’s chips.'

He said the facts of the case had been pieced together from CCTV footage which captured the attack shortly before 1am and from various witness statements.

One customer said he recalled the 
victim reacting to Glenny’s complaint by telling him he should not talk 
in the manner he did to the shop worker.

Glenny
was also said to have been involved in an exchange of words with a 
separate group of four young men including Mr Rourke who accused him of 
holding up the queue.

The defendant dropped some of his food as he went to leave the premises and was then approached by Mr Guest-Binns who was said to have told him 'just get out, go home'.

Glenny said he thought the chef was part of the other group of men and was scared that he was going to be assaulted so he punched him.

Mr Guest-Binns fell backwards and was immediately dazed and distressed from the blow, said Mr Allman.

'A number of people in the takeaway tried to perform CPR on Mr Guest-Binns but sadly by the time the paramedics arrived there was no sign of life,' he continued.

He was taken to hospital and pronounced dead.

A pathologist later stated the blow that led to his death was of 'moderate force'.

The prosecutor said the victim’s mother, Valerie Guest-Binns, on hearing of her son’s death said 'she could not believe what she was being told and simply felt numb'.

She said he would be 'sadly missed' by the family - none of whom were in court today.

Julie Taylor, defending, handed over a number of testimonials to the judge from Glenny’s family, friends and employer.

She said: 'They all have a common theme which is underlining his good character and their disbelief that this could have happened.

'Clearly the events in the early hours of May 5 were a tragedy for two families. A tragedy to a much lesser degree for the defendant and his family.

'He was a quiet, law-abiding young man, no doubt with hopes and dreams for the future.

'The most difficult thing is that this defendant fears for his future and that he has one and Mr Guest-Binns does not because of his actions. He is a young man wracked with guilt.

He plays over the early hours of May 5 over and over again and wishes he could turn back time.'

Passing sentence, Judge Pamela Badley said: 'I want to stress that no sentence can properly reflect the loss of life.'

Following sentencing, Detective Chief Inspector Andrea Barrow said: 'This was such a tragic and unnecessary loss of life which goes to highlight the potential dangers of drinking far too much alcohol and being oblivious to the consequences of your actions.

'Our thoughts remain with the family today and hope that this result today will bring them some closure and help them, in some small way, to cope with their tragic loss although nothing anyone can do will ever bring Ricky back.'
