A mother-of-three who was killed in a terrifying hit-and-run rampage was buried in a coffin decorated with her favourite leopard skin pattern today as hundreds gathered to celebrate her life.

Karina Menzies, 31, died after throwing her two young daughters to safety before she was hit by a van and killed in an unprovoked attack in Cardiff, South Wales, three weeks ago.

Mourners at a special church service, at the Church of Resurrection in the city’s Ely district, were reduced to tears today as poignant messages from her daughters were read out.

The close-knit community is still reeling from the tragic events of October 19 in which Ms Menzies died and 13 others, including seven children, were injured in the 30-minute spree of horror as a driver sped through suburban streets, mowing down families on their way home from school.

A crippling nerve condition meant that while she was able to save her children, her legs were so severely weakened that she was unable to run away from the vehicle.

Vicar Reverend Jan Gould spoke of Ms Menzies’ bravery which saved her children.

She said: ‘She would do anything for them and, as we know, she paid the ultimate price to save them three weeks ago today. 

‘There is no clearer sign of the depth of her love for them than that.’

Sister Sam Menzies spoke out publicly today to vow to look after her sister’s three orphaned daughters.

Other family members did the same at an emotionally charged funeral service at the Church of the Resurrection in Ely.

Up to 300 people were earlier reduced to tears as Reverend Gould read out personal messages from the children to their mother.

Daughter Eillie wrote: ‘I will never forget you. I love you. Sweet dreams, good bye, love from Ellie.’

An emotional message from daughter Sophie, who was not present when her mother was killed, was read out by the vicar.

Horror attack: Ms Menzies died and 13 others, including seven children, were injured as a driver mowed down families on their way home from school

The message read: ‘Dear mum, today I am feeling really sad because I know that it is time to say goodbye.

‘You were an amazing mum, you were fun, cool and so un-normal. I loved that about you.

‘I remember when me and you used to stay up late on a school night having munchies and watching films. I love you, mum, I really do.’

Sophie also described her mother as ‘really brave’ when she acted to ‘save my beautiful sisters’ lives’.

Family, friends and well-wishers 
crowded into the church to listen in silence to each word and gave every
emotional message a round of applause.

Many
were forced to stand due to the numbers attending the service which was
also relayed outside to scores of mourners unable to fit into the 
church.

Reverend Gould also paid her own tribute and likened the collective shock of the community to an electrical blackout.

She said: ‘Tragic death, which is almost always sudden and unexpected as it was for Karina, is like a blackout.

‘One minute the sun is shining. Next 
minute it's dark night. Without the slightest warning, or the slightest 
chance to prepare ourselves, we are plunged into an impenetrable 
darkness. And in the space of a minute our whole world is turned upside 
down.

So much sorrow: Mourners spilled out onto the street as up to 300 people filled the church to capacity as the close-knit community came to pay their respects

Qualities to live on in daughters: Ms Menzies was described as intelligent, bright, outgoing, bubbly and funny by Reverend Gould

‘There's nothing that can prepare us for something like this, or that can save us from its devastating effects.

Her leopard skin patterned coffin was drawn through the streets by two large black horses pulling an ornate glass hearse decorated with a single floral tribute of carnations spelling out the word ‘mum’.

Ms Menzies was killed outside Ely fire station by a white Iveco van which allegedly deliberately targeted young families.

Justice: Police investigate in the aftermath of the hit-and-run rampage on October 19

Operation: More than 70 officers have been investigating the attack, studying CCTV footage and taking statements

Reverend Gould said: ‘Karina was such a fun loving girl all her life, making the most of everything, the girl who loved to party, and who lived for her family.

‘She was the second eldest of six children, and as a child she was intelligent, bright, outgoing, bubbly and funny - qualities which I'm sure will continue to live on in her three precious daughters.

‘If you knew Karina even just a little bit you will know how much music ran through every fibre of her soul.

‘You'll know, too, how much she loved fashion, clothes and make-up. She always managed to make things look fabulous, even on a tight budget - whether that was the house, herself or her children.

‘It really mattered to her that everything always looked great.’

She spoke of how Ms Menzies' children were always a huge inspiration in her life.
