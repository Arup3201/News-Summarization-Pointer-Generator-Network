A biker led police on a high speed motorcycle chase through two Southern California counties while performing stunts and appearing to take a selfie.

He taunted California Highway Patrol officers at speeds of over 100 mph and ran several red lights.

During the hour long pursuit he even climbed onto the seat, let go with his hands and stood up.
