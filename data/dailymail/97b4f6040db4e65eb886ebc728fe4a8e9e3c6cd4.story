It may sound like a scene out of the 1980s hit comedy film Crocodile Dundee, but an Australian fisherman had a real-life fight with this five-foot-long reptile.

Ashley Sala became so enraged when he discovered yet another crocodile on the end of his fishing line that he tackled the animal before taking it home and spending the night with it sleeping below his bunk bed.

Mr Sala had been spending his 45th birthday fishing for Asian seabass, barramundi, at Ninds Creek, in the river mouth at Innisfail, approximately 55 miles south of Cairns, when he thought he'd caught a fish.

But when he went to reel his catch in, he discovered a five-foot-long crocodile at the end of his line.

He told cairns.com: 'I threw my line out to catch a barra for my birthday and I ended up catching a croc.

'I thought I'd caught my one-metre barra. I was so happy, I was yahooing and carrying on.

'Twenty minutes later after fighting it I brought it to the surface and when the moon came out from behind the clouds I realised it was a croc tangled up in my fishing line.'

Mr Sala said he didn't want the crocodile to die in the netting but was also still fed up with the reptiles stealing his bait and stalking him at local fishing haunts.

So Mr Sala placed the crocodile in his car to drive to his local councillor's to complain about the overpopulation of reptiles in the area.

Unfortunately Cassowary Coast councillor, Mark Nolan, who also holds the council's crocodile management portfolio, was asleep so Mr Sala was left with no choice but to bunk down with the animal for the night until it could be taken to a wildlife park.

His girlfriend was far from impressed by their unexpected house guest and made the pair sleep in an empty 'donga' – cabin – at his family's caravan park.

Mr Sala explained: 'I sat on the top bunk and had a few birthday beers by myself and watched the croc on the floor until I fell asleep.'

Councillor Mark Nolan praised Mr Sala's care of the animal and compared him to Crocodile Dundee actor Paul Hogan.

He said: 'Paul Hogan's got nothing on Ashley Sala. Paul Hogan never slept with a saltie. Ashley has, and I witnessed it.'

He added that the reptile was untangled by Queensland Parks and Wildlife Services officers the next day and it has now been relocated to a crocodile farm.
