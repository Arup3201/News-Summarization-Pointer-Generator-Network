Authorities are cracking down on Islamic fundamentalist preacher Junaid Thorne after they ordered him to face charges in court following allegations he has travelled between Sydney and Perth using false names. 

The controversial self-styled sheik was on Thursday issued with a notice to appear in a Perth court at a later date, an AFP spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia.

AFP officers conducted a search warrant on a home in Bass Hill, south-west of Sydney, on Thursday and the 25-year-old was subsequently informed of the notice.

He will face charges in court for using a carriage service to book a ticket under a false name and the second for using the ticket to travel interstate, the West Australian reports.

Authorities are cracking down on Islamic fundamentalist preacher Junaid Thorne after they ordered him to face charges in court following a suspected terror-related raid in Sydney on Thursday

While police only released few details of the raid in Sydney, Thorne could reportedly face further charges.

Daily Mail Australia understands Thorne has recently moved from Perth to Sydney. 

It comes days after he sparked outrage when he told social media followers that insults to the Prophet Mohammad were 'not allowed' and were likely to 'simulate some kind of response' following the terror attacks on satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris.

His comments came just hours after 12 people were killed in the Paris massacre.

Thorne said staff at Charlie Hebdo had 'forbade to learn the lesson' of a firebombing in 2011, which took place a day after a caricature of the Prophet was published.  

'Insulting someone's Prophet is very likely to stimulate some kind of response. It is not allowed under any context/religion,' Thorne tweeted last week.

'If you want to enjoy 'freedom of speech' with no limits, expect others to exercise "freedom of action".'

Thorne, who spent 14-years growing up in Saudi Arabia, refused to answer questions about his statement when contacted by Daily Mail Australia.

Outspoken politician Jacqui Lambie called for him to be jailed for treason following his controversial comments. 

In a statement, Ms Lambie blamed previous governments for failing to protect Australian citizens against these type of extremists living amongst us. 

'There are now Australian citizens (like the mongrel in WA) who brazenly, express public sympathy and support for the actions of the Islamic extremists,' Ms Lambie said. 

'When you provoke an enormous number of people, or degrade the followers of a religion by insulting something or someone they hold sacred, don't expect to be left alone,' he said. 

Ms Lambie called for Thorne and other extremists living in Australia to be tried for treason before they 'seek to impose their culture on us - or kill us'.

Junaid Thorne does not describe himself as an Islamic State supporter. He told the ABC last year: 'I may support them (on) certain issues, while I disagree with them in other issues.'

His remarks came as pictures emerged of the preacher last year accompanying Sulayman Khalid, 20, to a court appearance.

Khalid, from western Sydney, was charged with terrorism related offences last month over an alleged plot to commit guerilla warfare in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney.

The court appearance concerned allegations Khalid intimidated an Iraqi cleaner at a western Sydney shopping centre. 

Khalid rose to infamy after wearing an Islamic State symbol onto the set of an SBS television program about the Islamic State last year. 

Thorne would not answer questions about how he knew Khalid, only joking: 'We used to go out in (Kings) Cross together... Since we started going to church'.

Over the past 12 months, Thorne's views have been the subject of public scrutiny.

Following the nation's biggest ever terror raids last September, he labelled Australian authorities 'the real terrorists' in a statement posted on his Facebook page. 

After Melbourne man Numan Haider, 18, allegedly stabbed two police officers outside of a police station, Thorne said that he had been 'murdered by authorities'. 

Thorne later told the ABC Haider had attended some of his lectures, which he performs around the country.

Thorne does not describe himself as a supporter of the Islamic State. 

He told the ABC last year: 'If I were to vocalise my complete support to them (Islamic State), I would get in trouble,' he said.

'If I was to say that (I) don't support them at all, that would be untrue.

'I may support them on certain issues, while I disagree with them on other issues'.
