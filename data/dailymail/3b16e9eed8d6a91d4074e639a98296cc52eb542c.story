Tens of thousands of union activists laid siege to the Conservative   conference yesterday in protest at Government cuts.

Some 35,000 public sector workers staged a vocal, but peaceful protest as the conference got under way.

Chants of ‘Tories out’ and ‘David Cameron on your bike’ could be heard clearly behind the security barriers protecting conference delegates.

Taking to the streets: Thousands of union protesters marched through Manchester yesterday to show their anger at Tory cuts ahead of the party's conference in the city

March: Thousands walked through the city centre streets carrying banners from a wide range of unions

Fury: Demonstrators lit flares and sang song attacking the Prime Minister and his party during the peaceful protest

Organised by the Trades Union Congress, it was billed as a march and rally for ‘The Alternative – jobs, growth, justice’ in opposition to the coalition’s axing of public services and pensions.

Police were on alert for extremists attempting to hijack the peaceful protest, with mounted officers, vans and policemen and women lining the march route. But no arrests were made.

Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, said a mass walkout over pension reforms planned for next month was effectively a ‘general strike’ against the cuts.

He told the crowd: ‘We need a coalition of resistance, of trade unions, community groups, church organisations, and students and of our senior citizens, an amazing coalition of resistance to engage in every form of resistance, including co-ordinated industrial action.

Anger: A group of teenage protesters daubed themselves in fake blood and use it to paint their placards attacking the Tories

Dressing up: A student protester wore bandages and fake blood, while this baby's father dressed her in a t-shirt depicting the Prime Minister on a wanted poster

‘If you want to call it a general strike then so be it. The reality is civil disobedience is the oldest form of democracy and we should applaud it. We should applaud direct action and fantastic organisations like UK Uncut.

‘We should take our lead from the young people, the students who this time last year put 60,000 to 70,000 on the streets of London.’

Mark Serwotka, leader of the PCS union, told the crowd every village, town and city will see picket lines on November 30 when a mass strike has been called by several unions across the UK.

He added: ‘If you never fight you lose every time. Now’s the time to fight, now.’

And Tony Lloyd, MP for Manchester Central, was cheered as he said: ‘One blue is even less welcome here than Carlos Tevez, and that’s David Cameron. David Cameron is not welcome in this city.’

Peaceful: There were no arrests during the protests as a large police presence assured there was no violence or chance for extremists to take over

Posters: A demonstrator carries a number of banners demanding David Cameron's resignation and a general strike

Around 50 people, from protest group Occupy, staged a sit-down demonstration in Albert Square, in front of Manchester Town Hall, a police spokesman said.

Assistant Chief Constable Ian Hopkins, of Greater Manchester Police, said: ‘We are grateful to those protesters who co-operated fully with the police.’

The march required ‘a significant police presence in the interests of public safety and protecting the city’, he said.

‘Manchester is privileged to host the conference and the event is good for the city,’ he added.
