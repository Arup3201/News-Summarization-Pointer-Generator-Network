An AirAsia airliner has overshot the runway at an airport in the Philippines forcing passengers to make an urgent exit on emergency slides, it has been claimed.

The incident occured at Kalibo Airport in Aklan province and involved an Airbus A320-216 carrying 153 passengers and crew from the Filipino capital Manila.

Local journalist Jet Damazo-Santos was on board the plane and uploaded photographs to Twitter showing chaotic scenes as passengers were forced to disembark the aircraft on emergency slides.

'Engine was shut immediately, we were told to leave bags, deplane asap. Firetruck was waiting,' she said, adding that there appeared to be no injuries despite the plane coming to an 'abrupt stop'.

The incident comes just hours after six bodies and wreckage were recovered from the sea off the Indonesian coast of Borneo Island following the disappearance of Air Asia flight 8501 on Sunday.

Care: Elderly patients were pictured having their blood pressure checked in the aftermath of the incident

Describing the terrifying incident, Ms Damazo-Santos said: 'Nobody seems to be hurt. Weather was bad because of #senangph [sic]. Plane came to a very abrupt stop.'

Her mention of bad weather refers to tropical storm Seniang, which has been battering the Philippines for several days. 

She updated her Twitter account with a number of photographs taken in the aftermath of the incident, including images of elderly patients having their blood pressure checked and shoeless members of cabin standing on the runway, having removed their footwear to use the inflatable slide.

Ms Damazo-Santos said that her flight had been delayed by two hours  after the poor weather at Kalibo Airport had earlier forced a plane from Cebu Pacific airlines to turn back to Manila.

With all passengers said to be safe, Ms Damazo-Santos said they now face a long wait to reclaim their luggage as officials insist the plane is towed to a parking area before it can be unloaded.

The journalist later wrote about her experience for the Filipino news website Rappler.

In a statement AirAsia said: 'AirAsia Philippines confirms flight Z2 272 from Manila skidded off the Kalibo International Airport runway at 5:43PM upon landing. All 153 passengers and crew were able to disembark safely, no injuries reported.'

'All passengers are now at a hotel assisted by AirAsia staff,' they added.

The incident comes just hours after six bodies were recovered from the Java Sea following the disappearance of AirAsia flight 8501 on Sunday. 162 people were on board the flight when it disappeared from radars 42 minutes into its flight from Surabaya in Indonesia to Singapore.

Poor weather has been suggested a likely factor in that crash after it emerged the pilot requested to deviate from its flight plan and climb above bad weather.

By the time permission to do so was granted, the plane had already vanished from radars. 

Officials have confirmed that bodies and debris found in Java Sea off Indonesia are from AirAsia flight 8501, and a naval spokesman said the rescuers remain 'very busy' retrieving the victims. 

Scores of bodies were discovered alongside luggage, a plane door and an emergency slide floating in the water 100 miles off the coast of Borneo Island earlier today after three days of searching.

The recovery of six bodies came as devastated relatives of AirAsia crash victims collapsed in grief and were taken to hospital after an Indonesian television station showed disturbing uncensored footage of the corpses floating in the sea.

Images shown on a news channel showed at least one body floating in the water, causing the victims' relatives - who were watching live reports at crisis-centre at Juanda International Airport in Surabaya - to burst into tears, with some fainting and requiring hospital treatment.
