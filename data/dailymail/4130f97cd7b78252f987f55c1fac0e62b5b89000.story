A series of disturbing new allegations emerged today that added further weight to claims pro-Russian rebels looted the MH17 crash scene to sabotage the investigation and cash in on the disaster.

In the first, desperate relatives revealed how they had called the mobile phones of their loves ones - only for them to be answered by strangers with 'eastern European-sounding voices'.

After the initial shock, they immediately called the phone companies to shut down the accounts to prevent them being used, according to reports.

New evidence has also emerged that the rebels allegedly planned to sabotage the investigation by contaminating the site with parts from other planes

The claims, made in Holland's De Telegraaf, adds fuel to reports that crucial evidence has been tampered with after the Malaysian Airlines 
flight was blown out of the sky, allegedly by the same group of separatists, killing 298 people.

New evidence has also emerged that the rebels allegedly planned to sabotage the investigation by contaminating the site with parts from other planes.

UK intelligence chiefs claim they have uncovered evidence the insurgents also discussed removing bodies from the area and sending the black box data recorders to Moscow, according to Sky News sources in Whitehall.

Alistair Bunkall, Sky's Defence Correspondent, said: 'I think this will play into the fears that many people have that not all of the bodies will be returned, that parts of the plane have been tampered with in order to try and hide any evidence.

'This is all a part of UK intelligence working with intelligence agencies around the world to try and build up a picture not only of what happened at the point of impact, but also what happened in the hours and days that followed on from that.'

Meanwhile, an alleged decree by rebel commander Igor Strelkov appears to admit that the bodies of dead passengers were looted by pro-Russian rebels.

The order says that jewellery, watches
 and other valuables taken from bodies must be handed in to the 'defence
 fund' of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic by 8pm on 
Wednesday 23 July.

Styled like other orders from Strelkov, its veracity could not be immediately established.

But
 if true, it will be seen as scandalous that the rebels are cashing in 
on the dead victims of the Malaysian plane widely believed to have been 
shot down by the same pro-Moscow separatists.

Rather
 than ordering any looted possessions to be returned to the families, it
 demands they are taken to Strelkov's headquarters so they can be used 
to fund the insurgency campaign he is conducting.

'Valuable items must be sent to the DPR Defence Fund': The alleged order (above) is apparently signed by rebel army commander Colonel Igor Strelkov and carries what appears to be an official stamp

The
 text of order number 432, pictured here, says in Russian: 'To all 
detachments of Donetsk People's Republic army, to soldiers and 
commanders who from 18 to 21 July 2014 in the area where the Boeing 777 
of Malaysian airlines crashed and who possess personal belongings 
related to this airplane.

'Before
 8 pm on 23 July 2014 you must give these things away to the 
headquarters of DPR army. Valuable items (watches, earrings, lockets and
 other jewellery) must be sent to the DPR Defence Fund.'

It is signed by rebel army commander Colonel Igor Strelkov, and carries what appears to be an official stamp.

The alleged order has been posted on social media websites in Ukraine and Russia.

If true, it would confirm claims by Kiev officials that the bodies were looted.

At least one picture has emerged which appeared to show a ring being taken by a rebel from a body at the crash site.

A Ukrainian government advisor Anton Gerashchenko has claimed: 'After terrorists looters stole all the cash, jewellery, mobile phones and credit cards of passengers of ill-fated Boeing - they took up their favourite deal - gathering of scrap metal. Aluminum from which made the plane is expensive.'

Two days ago, Andrei Lysenko, spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, claimed: 'The cynicism of these gangsters has no limits.

'According to our information, apart from picking up valuable personal belongings of the passengers, terrorists are using credit cards of the victims.'

However, it is unclear that relatives have complained about this, a point the Russian media has made strongly in alleging these are slurs from the Ukrainian side.

'Gerashchenko said in an interview that he had information that the rebels were cashing the victims credit cards. No complaints from relatives or bank records were produced, of course,' said a commentary from RIA Novosti news agency in Moscow.

Strelkov is alleged by Kiev to be a serving colonel in Russia's GRU military intelligence.

He is accused of fomenting unrest in eastern Ukraine, and was earlier based in Crimea when the Black Sea peninsula was annexed by Russia.

His 'order' is revealed on the day when the first bodies are scheduled to arrive back in Holland.

Russia 'bears responsibility' for the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, U.S. intelligence officials said, but they offered no evidence that Vladimir Putin was directly involved.

The senior intelligence officials were cautious in their assessment, noting that while the Russians have been arming separatists in eastern Ukraine, the U.S. had no direct evidence that the missile used to shoot down the passenger jet came from Russia.

The plane was probably shot down by an SA-11 surface-to-air missile fired by Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, the intelligence officials said.

U.S. intelligence chiefs have found no evidence of Vladimir Putin's direct involvement in the shooting down of MH17 but said Russia 'bears responsibility' for the disaster

They also said that after analysing taped phone conversations between separatists obtained by U.S. intelligence it could be all but concluded that the culprits did not realise they were targeting a commercial airliner.

'Five days into it [following the crash] it does appear to be a mistake,' one official said.

The officials briefed reporters over intelligence related to last week's air disaster, which killed 298 people.

It comes a day after the first pictures emerged of damaged panels from MH17, which appear to show evidence of shrapnel and missile damage.

They cited intercepts, satellite photos and social media postings by separatists, some of which have been authenticated by U.S. experts.

Separatists previously had shot down 12 Ukrainian military airplanes, the officials said

But the officials said they did not know who fired the missile or whether any Russian operatives were present at the missile launch.

They were not certain that the missile crew was trained in Russia, although they described a stepped-up campaign in recent weeks by Russia to arm and train the rebels, which they say has continued even after the downing of the commercial jetliner.

In terms of who fired the missile, 'we don't know a name, we don't know a rank and we're not even 100% sure of a nationality,' one official said.

White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said the US was still working to determine whether the missile launch had a 'direct link' to Russia, including whether there were Russians on the ground during the attack and the degree to which Russians may have trained the separatists to launch such a strike.

'We do think President Putin and the Russian government bears responsibility for the support they provided to these separatists, the arms they provided to these separatists, the training they provided as well and the general unstable environment in eastern Ukraine,' he said in an interview with CNN.

He added that heavy weaponry continues to flow into Ukraine from Russia following the downing of the plane.
