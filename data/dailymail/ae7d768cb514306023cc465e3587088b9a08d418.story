She revealed in January she was pregnant, ruling her out of the Commonwealth Games in Glasgow which get under way next week.

She said at the time she was '100 per cent set on returning to full-time athletics' after the birth and determined to 'go for a second gold medal at the Rio Olympics in 2016'.

As well as her success at the London Olympics, Ennis-Hill also won pentatholon gold at the World Indoor Championships in 2010 and heptatholon gold at the 2009 World Championships and 2010 European Championships.
