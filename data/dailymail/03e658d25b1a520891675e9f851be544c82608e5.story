It was a very lucky escape for a driver  as a ratchet strap flew off a truck and smashed through the windscreen landing on the dashboard of the car behind.

Amazingly, the driver survived without any major injuries as the dangerous object came flying off the truck at an almighty speed headed straight towards the Nissan Navara instantly smashing through the windscreen.

Before the driver knew what had happened the car veered off the road and spun around 180 degrees before abruptly stopping as the car was facing the wrong way in the left hand lane of the M1 motorway in Brisbane.

To add to the miraculous escape, the car was towing a trailer which crashed into the grassy embankment and then slid under the car it was attached to, which ended up on two wheels but neither vehicles managed to completely flip.

This driver was amazingly not seriously injured when a ratchet strap flew off a truck and smashed through the windscreen of the the Nissan Navara behind it

Before the driver knew what had happened the car veered off the road and spun around 180 degrees before abruptly stopping as the car was facing the wrong way in the left hand lane of the M1 motorway in Brisbane

The terrifying incident was captured by a dashcam in the car behind and has taken off online with people in disbelief that the driver was not seriously harmed by the freak accident.

The male driver who had the camera attached to his dashboard can be heard repeatedly saying: 'Woah! Woah! Woah!' on the video that was posted on the Dash Cam Owners Australia Facebook page.

Kylie Jones said she does not know how the driver didn't crash from the unexpected incident

'I would have braced position and crashed if I had that massive ratchet fly towards me.'

While Vicky Houley commended the driver on managing to avoid further accidents.

'Congrats to the driver for being able to avoid any other traffic being involved.

While others commented on how the incident could have been avoided. 

'That's what happens when you winch without it being properly attached,' Ian White posted.

'Chances are it was not being used as a winch but as a snatch point.'

'Also, I wonder if a dampener was used.'

While Victor Fkiaras said that the load binder was not secured properly. 

'Damn lucky it stopped where it did and didn't go right through. One of those on your chest at speed, yeah........... NO THANKS!' 

'This is why traffic cops pick on insecure loads, this could have killed the driver,' Barrie Fitzgerald posted.
