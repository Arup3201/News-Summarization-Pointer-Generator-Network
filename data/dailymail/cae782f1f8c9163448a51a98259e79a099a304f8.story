Police have arrested a hostage-taker after he freed his captives at the Ingolstadt city hall in Bavaria.

The standoff, which began this morning, forced Chancellor Angela Merkel to cancel an election rally there.

He imprisoned three people hours before she was due to arrive in the town for an election rally.

Freed: German special police force officers in Ingolstadt captured the hostage taker and freed his captives unharmed

Successful mission: Police arrested the man at City Hall after his siege began at 9am local time

Police spokesman Guenther Beck said that
the captor was injured during a police raid late this afternoon, and 
his two remaining captives were freed after he had earlier released one.

It is unclear what the suspect's demands were but he was believed to be armed with a handgun.

The incident started around 9am local time today, when police said the man 'has a number of people at his mercy'.

One of the hostages, deputy mayor Sepp Misslbeck, was released after five hours, and a man and a woman were released later.

The suspect, a young man, was said to 
have stalked a female employee at the city hall, and to have been 
disgruntled about a decision taken by the local council.

The hostage situation came just a few hours before Angela Merkel was due to address supporters in the city at 5pm.

Special forces: Officers brought the siege to a close after hours of negotiation, although the captor has reportedly been injured in the process

Speech: Angela Merkel was due to appear in Ingolstadt just hours after a man took hostages in the city hall

Threat: Ingolstadt is a medieval town in Bavaria which hosts the headquarters of Audi

The rally was cancelled by her party, the Christian Democratic Union/

National elections are taking place on September 22, while Bavaria will hold state elections a week earlier.

Ingolstadt is a medieval city of 130,000 people around 50 miles north of Munich which hosts the headquarters of carmaker Audi.

The old city hall, one
of two city halls in Ingolstadt, dates back to the 14th century, though
the building was expanded in the 19th century.

It is home to the 
mayor's office and the city's tourist information office, among other 
administrative departments.
