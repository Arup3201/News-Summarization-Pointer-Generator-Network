Parts of two huge steel bolts, the size of human arms, have broken off London's new Cheesegrater building forcing the skyscraper to be cordoned off while an investigation is carried out.

Pieces of the one metre bolts became dislodged on the fifth and 19th floors of the 47-storey landmark structure - with one falling hundreds of feet to the ground.

Developers British Land confirmed in a stock exchange announcement that two bolts have broken at 122 Leadenhall Street in the City of London but insist 'the building is fine'.

Safety scare: Two bolts, thought to be around one metre in length, have have fallen from the Leadenhall building this week, nicknamed the Cheesegrater for its distinctive wedge shape

A spokesman for the real estate group said there is 'no risk to the structural integrity of the building' but admitted they have called an urgent investigation as 'public safety is our priority'.

She added: 'No one was injured in either incident. An examination is being undertaken of the remaining bolts. 

'An area has been cordoned off around the base of the building while this process is ongoing. The Building Control Department has been notified.'

It is believed that one bolt broke off from the 19th floor earlier in the week but stayed within the building's structure without hitting the ground

It is believed that one bolt broke on the 19th floor earlier in the week but the portion that fell stayed within the building's structure without hitting the ground.

Plans for the Leadenhall building were first proposed in 2001. The steel structure was completed this year and has earned the name the Cheesegrater for its distinctive wedge shape - designed to preserve the view of St. Paul's Cathedral. 

Owner/ Developer: British Land

Nickname: The Cheesegrater 

Construction period: 2001 - 2014

Estimated cost: £286million

Floors: 48 

Height to tip: 224m

Occupied height: 203m 

UK ranking: 4th tallest building in UK

Global ranking: 493rd tallest building in world

Office rental: £85 per sq ft to rent 41st floor

Floorspace: 908,730 sq ft

The second bolt piece plummeted from the fifth floor on Tuesday.

Fortunately, it landed in an area already cordoned off for construction, but the entire pavement surrounding the skyscraper has now been sectioned off while safety checks are carried out. 

The building, nicknamed the Cheesegrater for its distinctive wedge shape, is due to open its offices next year and British Land insist the incident will not cause any delay.

The company has announced that contractor Laing O'Rourke and structural engineers Arup are starting a full investigation and the rest of the building's bolts are being examined. 

Floorspace in the skyscraper, which was finally completed last month, is the most expensive in the City - with FM Global, the American insurance company, recently agreeing to pay £85 per sq ft to rent the 41st floor.

Aon, the multinational insurer, signed a contract to be the main tenant of the tower in 2011.

The Cheesegrater was designed by Lord Rogers of Riverside, who redeveloped Lloyd's of London, but construction had to be halted during the recession when the value of commercial properties fell. 

The building's sloping shape was calculated to allow a view of St Paul's from Fleet Street.

The City of London Corporation, the area's local authority, declined to comment on the incident - claiming it was an issue for the developers.
