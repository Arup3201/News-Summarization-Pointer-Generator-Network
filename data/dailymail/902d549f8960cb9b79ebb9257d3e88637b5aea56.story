A space-aged pod which claims to offer a relaxing place for city workers to unwind after a long day in the office has gone on sale in Japan.

The Kakureya, which translates as 'cosy room' is being marketed as a special place where people can go in between work and going to the local karaoke bar and an alternative to the garden shed, as many in Japan's cities don't have the luxury of a garden.

The name Kakureya, is a cross between the Japanese words kakureru - 'to hide' and heya, which means room.

The Kakureya pod, which translates a 'cosy room' has gone on sale in Japan costing £4,500

Office workers looking for a relaxing place after a stressful day can slide themselves into the pod to 'get away' from the outside world

The interior of the Kakureya, which features shelving units to store books and snacks and a desk to store a computer or laptop

And the makers believe it is the perfect place to de-stress after a long day at work.

They say: 'If you just need to escape for a bit, it can be hard to find somewhere to be alone if you're constantly surrounded by people.

'But you'll never find yourself in that situation again, thanks to our cool invention on the market now.'

The manufacturers have described the unit
 as a cross between a space-age pod and an internet cafe, costing 
less than £4,500.

Owners slide themselves into the small pod to relax and can store items such as toys or books on the storage shelves inside, right 

Those shutting themselves away from the outside world in the Kakureya can use the desk inside to catch up on some work or study

Alternatively, the can relax and watch a film on the pod's TV and kick back with a drink and snacks

They added: 'The unit features everything you need to immerse yourself in a relaxing space. Snug and cosy, it has just enough room to slide yourself in using the retractable door.

'It has ample shelf space to store your favourite snacks, and you can even place your computer’s keyboard in a pull-out drawer under the desk.'

Order books for the Kakureya are said to be full and it is hoped that models for export will become available soon.
