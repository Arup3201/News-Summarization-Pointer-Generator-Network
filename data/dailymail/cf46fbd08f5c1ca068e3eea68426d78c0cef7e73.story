Accused: Rebekah Brooks

David Cameron’s former spin doctor was charged yesterday with illegally purchasing sensitive information about the Royal Family.

Andy Coulson is accused of conspiring to obtain an internal telephone directory for the Royal Household.

The directory, known as the Green Book, includes landlines and mobile numbers for royal aides.

The offence is alleged to have taken place while he oversaw the work of News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman.

The claims were revealed as Coulson, Goodman, two other News International employees and a Ministry of Defence official were accused of a ‘cash for stories’ conspiracy.

Rebekah Brooks, former chief executive of News International, has been charged with paying a defence strategist £100,000 for information over a seven-year period.

The announcement was the most significant yet in the Scotland Yard investigation into corrupt payments to public officials.

It threw News International into a fresh crisis as claims against the company continued to mount and the first formal allegations were made relating to The Sun newspaper.

Coulson and Brooks face a tangle of three separate sets of complex charges linked to their conduct at News International.

Judge Mr Justice Fulford may yet 
decide to combine some or all of the cases before the first trial opens 
before a jury next September.

The Prime Minister dodged questions 
about the phone-hacking and bribery scandal and the role of his 
ex-communications chief yesterday.

Speaking at a press conference in 
Northern Ireland before the impending G8 summit, Mr Cameron said he did 
not want to prejudice impending court hearings.

He said: ‘I’ve made 
clear my regret on many occasions about this issue. We should allow the 
police and the prosecuting authorities to follow the evidence wherever 
it leads.’

Charged: David Cameron's former spin doctor Andy 
Coulson (pictured today leaving a London police station) and ex-News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks will be
charged as part of the investigation into alleged corrupt payments to 
public officials

Charged: Former News of the World royal correspondent Clive Goodman, pictured, and The Sun's former chief reporter John Kay are also to be charged

Alison Levitt QC, of the Crown Prosecution Service, announced two groups of suspects will face trial over the bribery claims.

Coulson and Goodman will face charges 
over two alleged conspiracies, one in 2002-03 and one in 2005, relating 
to the authorisation of payments to officials.

Coulson said: ‘I am extremely 
disappointed by this latest CPS decision. I deny the allegations made 
against me and will fight the charges in court.’

The second alleged conspiracy involved
Brooks, during her time as editor of The Sun, her chief reporter John 
Kay and MoD official Bettina Jordan-Barber.

Jordan-Barber, who works at a base in 
Upavon, Wiltshire, is accused of accepting cash for information that 
formed the basis of ‘a series’ of stories.

The mother of two, who has been 
suspended from her job as a ‘strategy officer’, co-ordinated visits to 
operations in Afghanistan. Detectives from Scotland Yard’s Operation 
Elveden have so far arrested 52 people, including 27 journalists, six 
police officers and 12 public officials.

The sprawling inquiry into claims 
officials were bribed for information emerged in the aftermath of the 
phone-hacking scandal, which has its own inquiry, Operation Weeting.

All five will appear at Westminster 
Magistrates’ Court next Thursday accused of conspiracy to cause 
misconduct in a public office.

The offence carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

Charged: Bettina Jordan-Barber, who has been charged in relation to payments made to public officials, is seen here with her husband Nigel and their children
