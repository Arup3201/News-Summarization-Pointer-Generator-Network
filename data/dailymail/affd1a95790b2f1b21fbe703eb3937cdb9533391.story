One new mother is looking forward to rekindling her sex life with her husband after an operation has relieved her of the vaginal discomfort she experienced after childbirth.

After the birth of her first child, 30-year-old
Michelle’s episiotomy (a surgical incision used to enlarge the vaginal opening to help deliver a baby) was stitched too tightly, pulling skin too tightly together at the entrance to her vagina.

The pulling gave Michelle constant discomfort
and pain when walking, sitting 
and lifting. She could no longer use tampons and sex was off the cards 
entirely – a major issue for Michelle, who was keen to extend her family.

Painful: Michelle visits Dr Dawn to seek help after her episiotomy was stitched too tightly, pulling skin across the entrance to her vagina

Michelle, from Bedfordshire, visited Dr Dawn on Channel 4's Embarrassing Bodies because she was keen to gain relief from the persistent agony she had been left with after birth.

Michelle, whose son is now seven months old, said: 'I'm in pain walking, sitting, sex is a no. It does take its toll after all this time.'

Family plan: By cutting out the scar tissue and restitching it, Mr Abdallah Fayyad aimed to reduce pain and allow Michelle to continue with her family plans

'I had a baby seven months ago and I'm still in pain,' she added.

After inspecting her vagina, Dr Dawn concludes that Michelle was 'cut rather than tore' when giving birth to her 7lbs 6oz baby.

Birth is imminent and the perineum hasn’t had time to stretch slowly

The baby’s head is too large for the vaginal opening

The baby is in distress

The mother needs a forcep or vacuum assisted delivery

The baby is in a breech presentation and there is a complication during delivery

The mother isn’t able to control her pushing

Dr Dawn sent Michelle to see Consultant Urogynaecologist, Mr Abdallah Fayyad at the Spire Harpenden Hospital for a small operation to reconstruct the entrance to her vagina.

By cutting out the scar tissue and restitching it to relieve the tightness, Mr Abdallah Fayyad aimed to reduce pain and allow Michelle to continue with her family plans.

Michelle is thrilled with the results and has been able to resume a physical relationship with her husband.

Twelve weeks after the operation, Michelle returned to see Dr Dawn for a check-up.

She said: 'Everything is back to normal, totally pain-free, it's brilliant.'

'In that case, I guess sex is back on the agenda then, and you're smiling,' said Dr Dawn,

'It's great to see a big smile on your face and you've now got your life back.'
