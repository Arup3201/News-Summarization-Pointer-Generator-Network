'You're all at the top of your game.'

She also thanked all the people at home and said getting to know Australia's people had been a 'thrill'.

While her co hosts were equally moved.

'The only joy that comes for me from you leaving is knowing one of us won't be tired when we meet up,' joked Lisa Wilkinson.

'You're an extraordinary inspiration. Your professionalism and your support from day one.

Sylvia Jeffreys, 28, was announced as the replacement for the long running Channel Nine news presenter just after 8am.

Georgie did the honours: 'Congratulations I'm really thrilled to pass on the baton to you... you're working with the best in the business,' both women welled up with tears.

Sylvia said she had tremendous respect for Gardner as a colleague: 'She has also been a wonderful friend and a generous mentor to me. She leaves the biggest of shoes to fill.'

Queensland-born Jeffreys started her television career with Channel Nine in Brisbane, where her reports, in particular on the devastating 2010-11 Queensland floods and the destructive tropical Cyclone Yasi, won high praise from the network.

Since transferring to Nine’s Sydney headquarters she has become one of the most familiar faces on the network’s news and current affairs programs.

Adding to the tribute filled program, Cold Chisel guitarist Ian Moss, serenaded Georgie with the Ray Charles hit Georgia On My Mind, as a photo montage of her time on the program rolled. 

To close, her husband Tim Baker and nine-year-old daughter Bronte and son Angus, seven joined the Today team on the couch for some last words.

Angus said he was looking forward to eating chocolate with his mother and watching movies, because she always fell asleep watching movies with their father Tim.

Georgie revealed that when she told her children she was resigning they told her, 'Mummy that's great news.'

She may be leaving Today but fans of Georgie Gardner will be relieved to know they haven’t seen the last of her on the Nine network.

As well as filling in on Today from time to time, the news presenter will continue on the 6pm bulletin duties with Peter Overton.

She will also take up the co-host chair on Mornings with David Campbell when Sonia Kruger moves to cover Big Brother later in the year.

As well as this Gardner will contribute to 60 Minutes.Nine’s Director of News and Current Affairs, Darren Wick said of the presenters move: ‘Georgie is a much valued member of the Nine News team and we welcome the opportunity to have her professional presence in a range of new roles across the network, including reporting on 60 Minutes.'

'I'll always remember that moment.'

'I want to thank all of you,' she said one last time.

'You mean the world to me... you've been the most extraordinary colleagues.'

She also gave a shout out to her colleagues behind the scenes, the 'angels in makeup', and the production team who she said were 'the bets in the business'.

'I'll be eternally grateful for how you've made me feel'.

A special clip of Gardner's best moments kicked off the show on Friday morning, before the beautiful blonde treated to a special farewell breakfast by her co-presenter Karl Stefanovic to mark the momentous occasion.

Sounds of sirens signaled the arrival of two NSW coppers to present the lucky lady with a delicious farewell breakfast of an egg and bacon McMuffin.

The mother of two looked less than impressed and remarked, 'Jeez you never fail to surprise me Karlos.'

While Lisa joked 'you really raided the petty cash for that one'.

As cheeky Karl advised her it would help 'line her stomach' for later, obviously planning a big send off for the lovely lady.

A fun montage took a look back at some of Australian beauties best bits, including some provocative references including 'massage balls', 'crack at my buns', 'long, pokey thing'.

There were also touching tributes from her co-workers.

'She understands people and connects with people, that's what makes her the best newsreader in the country,' said Steven Jacobs

While Richard Wilkins commended her 'wicked sense of humour'.

When Gardner announced her departure late last month, she revealed that decision was motivated by wanting to spend more time with her family and be a 'present mummy, instead of grumpy mummy'.

Gardner said: ‘I’m going to be finishing up, the time has come. I made this announcement with a very heavy heart.'

However, she will remain with the Nine Network as a weekend newsreader, covering for colleagues Peter Overton and Lisa Wilkinson when they are on holidays, and taking over the co-hosting gig on Mornings with David Campbell when usual host Sonia Kruger is working on Big Brother. 

Describing crew and presenters of Today as 'family', she welled up and said her decision was down to the time commitment working on the show: 'The hours are grueling.'

She added she would continue to watch the program even though she was no longer starring on it.

Earlier this week, Georgie revealed to Show And Tell that she was  'was desperately trying to have number three' and the loss 'really rocked me, absolutely rocked me.'

'Some women I know have miscarriages and are very accepting and say that’s OK, that’s nature taking its course,' she said, 'but, my god, it really took me to a very deep and dark place actually.'

'I’m sure at 39 weeks of course it would be a lot harder, it would be a lot more harrowing than nine or 10 weeks, which was what I was.

'(But) it was still a life, and still a dream. It’s the possibility ... I wanted it so badly.'
