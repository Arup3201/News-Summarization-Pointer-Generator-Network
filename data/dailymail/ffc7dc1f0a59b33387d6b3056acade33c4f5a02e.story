The Queen presented traditional Maundy money during a church service in Oxford today in only her second public appearance since recovering from illness.

Joined by the Duke of Edinburgh Her Majesty appeared to be in good spirits as she distributed coins to selected recipients during the 'Royal Maundy' service at the city's Christ Church cathedral.

The money was given in purses to retired 
pensioners recommended by clergy and ministers of all denominations in the local diocese. The annual service was being held in Oxford for the first time in almost 400 years.

Tradition: The Queen visited Oxford's Christ Church cathedral today to attend the annual Royal Maundy service

Honour: Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh both appeared to be in good spirits as they posed for photographs with churchmen, dignitaries and a group of local school children

Protection: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh were guarded by beefeaters during the service - which was the first of its kind to be held in Oxford since the reign of King Charles I

Charles I was the last monarch to carry out the ceremony in the city in 1642 and 1643 when his court was established there during the Civil War. The Maundy service is held each year on the day before Good Friday.

The Queen - looking radiant in blue - handed out the famous red and white purses 
of money in Christ 
Church cathedral to 87 women and 87 men - as she is now in her 87th year.

The red purse contained a £5 coin and 50p coin commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Queen's coronation in 1953.

The white purse carried the famous Maundy money, silver 1p, 2p, 3p and 4p pieces - equal to 87p.

Ceremony: During the service - which was conducted by the Bishop of Worcester Dr John Inge - the Queen distributed the Maundy money in purses to 87 women and 87 men, one for each year of her life

Purses: The Maundy purses were arranged on a gold plate ready for distribution by the Queen. Each recipient received two purses - one red and one white

The
Maundy Service, which dates back to the 13th century, has Biblical 
origins and echoes the story of Christ washing the feet of his disciples
shortly before his death.

It is held in a Church of England venue on the day before Good Friday.

Initially
the sovereign gave money to the poor - and washed recipients' feet. 
Foot-washing ended with James II in the 18th century.

Clothes and other items were also once distributed as part of the service, but this was eventually substituted for more money.

The service is now held in a different location every year, with new recipients of Maundy money generally chosen from that diocese for services to the community or church.

Recipients are pensioners who are recommended by local clergymen.

Maundy money is now struck in non-circulating silver 1p, 2p, 3p and 4p pieces  - equal to 87p and contained within a leather purse.

Aside the maundy money, the recipients are also given another purse containing £1 representing the money for redemption of the monarch's gown, £3 in lieu of the clothing once given, and £1.50 in place of the food once presented.

One man and one woman are chosen for each year the Queen has lived.

The event is regarded as a 'royal pilgrimage' and the only time the Queen travels to give out awards.

Barbara Muldowney, 85, from 
Wokingham, Berkshire, is a member of St Bartholomew's 
church in the nearby village of Arborfield.

She
said: 'I was nominated for a number of things, particularly 40 years' 
teaching, also for membership of Arborfield's church for 50 years and 
working amongst the young people.

'I'm tremendously honoured by it, I think it's a tremendous privilege - I feel very inadequate.'

Geoffrey Moss, 74, from Ascot, 
Berkshire, attends All Saints church in the town and has worked helping local pensioners.

He
said: 'I was nominated for my general service to elderly people in my 
community. I help with Talking Newspapers, I'm a trustee for Age Concern
and for the last 16 years I've helped my wife who runs a drop-in centre
for the elderly in Ascot.'

Mr Moss added: 'This goes way back to the origins of Christianity with Jesus washing feet so it's an incredible experience.'

Patricia Peirson, a 90-year-old 
great-grandmother of five, has been a member of the congregation at St 
Mary's Church in her hometown of Datchet for more than 50 years.

She said: 'I was amazed to be nominated. I never would have aspired to something like this. I'm very pleased. I'm going to save the money and give it to my great-grandchildren.'

Kings and Queens traditionally carried nosegays - sweet-smelling bouquets -to ward off unpleasant smells during the ceremony.

Today
the Queen and Duke followed suit and both carried posies of mixed 
flowers and foliage, including daffodils and rosemary, as they left the 
cathedral after the service.

Meanwhile, the Prince of Wales visited Kirkby Lonsdale, where he appeared to be slightly taken aback when tasting a local tipple.

Charles was given a glass of Jubilee stout, courtesy of the Kirkby Lonsdale Brewery Company, while walking around the historic market town.

Given a choice from its ranges, Charles aptly plumped for a drop of Jubilee and gave it the thumbs-up.

He was then presented with a selection of the brewery's ales to give to the Duke of Edinburgh.

An enthusiastic crowd braved the 
chilly temperatures to greet Charles, who last visited in 1993, as he walked around the market square 
and met stallholders, shopkeepers and well-wishers.

One member of the public gave him an early Easter present of a Maltesers Easter egg.

Among stallholders he met was Sarah Peel, 46, from Milnthorpe, who runs Cool Crafting which runs sewing and crafting workshops.

She said: 'He was very interested in hearing about it. He wanted to get London knitting for the Jubilee last year.'

Pupils from Queen Elizabeth School 
were among the well-wishers in the crowd and a saxophone quartet from 
the school provided musical accompaniment along with Kirkby Lonsdale 
Brass Band.

St Mary's Church, which dates back to 
Norman times, was his final stop as he presented a long-service 
certificate to church verger Peter Briggs.

He finished the day in Alston, 
Cumbria, on a visit to Bonds Precision Castings, to view a specialist 
manufacturing process of steel castings.

In the foundry, Charles watched molten metal being poured in to make a steel casting, before unveiling a plaque.

He made the visit to launch a project between Land Rover and the Prince's Countryside Fund to offer five Freelander 2 vehicles for a year to individuals and groups who can prove they can put it to good use for the benefit of their community.

Charles told the crowd that it is essential 'we can maintain the priceless national asset which is our precious countryside'.

He said: 'The important thing to remember is if we do not look after it, of course it is the farmers who do much of that, then once that is lost you just cannot recreate it. It is not something you can start again so easily.'

The scheme offers five Freelander 2 vehicles for a year to individuals and groups
