Star Wars obsessives have forever insisted George Lucas' franchise is an art of the highest order.

And if you didn't agree, this superfan may be about to change your mind.

In a pain-staking effort spanning months, designer and illustrator Aled Lewis has translated the entire story into a hand-stitched 30ft tapestry akin to the Bayeux.

Epic: Aled Lewis spent months translating Episodes 1-6 of George Lucas' revered work onto a tapestry

The work, now on display and up for sale for $20,000 in an LA gallery, mirrors the classic Bayeux Tapestry

Every character and scene is depicted in intricate detail, such as Darth Vader (left)

And the price tag is no less frivolous - set at a cool $20,000.

Unlike the Norman Romanesque epic, Mr Lewis did have the aid of technology to lay out the designs first.

He first created each scene on a laptop - before translating it pixel-for-pixel onto cloth using a needle and thread.

From large-scale battle scenes to 
Luke's final confrontation with Darth Vader, every iconic moment is 
weaved in cotton and thread into the intricate masterpiece.

The epic has been likened to the Norman work, the Bayeux Tapestry, depicting the conquering of England

The mirror the Latin tituli on the Norman Romanesque work, Mr Lewis has created a border of quotes in Aurebesh, the language spoken in some parts of the fictional galaxy

Every scene: Mr Lewis details every iconic moment. Yoda's lightsaber battle with Count Dooku at the end of Episode II is depicted here, before Anakin and Padmé's wedding

The work is a testament to Star Wars fanatics' claims that the six-movie franchise is art of the highest order

Though it falls 200ft short of the revered work depicting the conquest of England, Mr Lewis' Coruscant 
Tapestry, named after the central planet, goes to some lengths to match 
it.

Littered with in-jokes for fanatics, it comes complete with quotes stitched in Aurebesh, the fictional language used in the films, to mirror the Latin captions on the original.

Like Mr Lewis' work, the original Bayeux Tapestry, culminating in the 1066 Battle of Hastings, and is actually created from a piece of embroided cloth, not traditional wood.

He designed the work on a laptop then copied it pixel-for-pixel with a needle and thread

The work is accompanied by Aurebesh translation to help viewers crack the codes while following the story

Eventually Mr Lewis was forced to enlist the help of some friends and family members to complete the piece

It is more than nine centuries old and shows the events leading up to the Norman Conquest of England that ended with the famous battle.

French legend maintains it was commissioned and created by Queen Matilda, William the Conqueror’s wife and her ladies in waiting.

London-based Mr Lewis had to enlist the help of some friends and family members to help complete the dramatic work, now exhibited in LA's Gallery 1988.
