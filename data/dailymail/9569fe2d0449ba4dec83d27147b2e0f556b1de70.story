Travellers are being warned about a scam in which people are promised $999 in credit for flights or holidays.

Would be holiday-makers in Australia have reported getting automated messages purporting to be from Qantas or Virgin Australia, informing them that they have been chosen to receive $999 towards a holiday.

They are then asked to press one on their phones, and are directed to 'consultants' who ask for personal and financial information.

Qantas and Virgin have also issued warnings about the scam, which has nothing to do with either airline.

'Consumers, businesses and airlines are all reporting the scam,' said the fair trading minister for New South Wales, Mr Mason-Cox.

'There is no end to the variety of scams or the devious devices scammers will employ to take people’s money and personal information. The promise of a credit on flights may be appealing but I urge people to hang up on these calls.'

Mr Mason-Cox said scammers attempt to lure people in by asking them for some personal information needed to enable them to redeem their prize.

'Typically they have been asking for the person’s age and if they have a valid credit card,' he said.Scammers can obtain people's private numbers fraudulently or from anywhere it has been publicly listed.

And people can still receive scam calls even if they have a private number or have listed their number on the Australian Government’s Do Not Call Register.

Information about the scam can be found on the Scam Watch website, which advises: 'SCAMwatch and Qantas are warning people about automated calls from scammers posing as Qantas staff claiming that they’ve won a credit towards their next holiday.

'If you receive this call, hang up...If you hand over your credit card details, you will find that money has been taken rather than deposited from your bank account.'

The scammers are persistent, according to reports, with some consumers and businesses saying they have received several such calls in one day. 

Qantas stated on its website: 'We are aware that some customers are receiving automated phone calls purporting to be from Qantas.

'These calls are not from us, and can easily be identified as unauthentic. Qantas consultants will always call customers directly to discuss their bookings and do not use an automated phone system when contacting customers proactively.'

Qantas also points out that calls are being made to people who are not even customers of Qantas.

People took to Twitter to warn others about the scam, with one Tweeter warning, 'I just had a robocall claiming to be from #qantas that I won $999 towards my next holiday. No surprise, it's a #scam.'

Another tweeted: 'Received clever SCAM phone call today (from so called @VirginAustralia), past booked flights allowed us $945 credit, needed to give CC.'
