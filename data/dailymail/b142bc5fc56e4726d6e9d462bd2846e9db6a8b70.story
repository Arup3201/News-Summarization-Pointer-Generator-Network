Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, is recognised as the launching pad for the Christmas shopping season. It signifies an eruption of frantic excess, breathless extravagance and uncontrolled spending. 

This year, by happy coincidence, it was also the day on which the Premier League published details of the money which each club handed to football agents in the previous 12 months.

In 2012, the leeches pocketed £77,003,130 in fees, and the amount provoked a degree of outrage. Last year, their pickings had risen to £96,673,089, and ‘monstrous’ was one of the favoured descriptions. We suspected that the year ending September 30, 2014, would break the nine-figure barrier, and our suspicions were well founded.

Manchester United spent big in the summer on the likes of Angel di Maria  but not on agents' fees

These sharp-suited, self-seeking, utterly superfluous hustlers extracted a total of £115,261,136 from the national sport. And gave it precious little in return.

The headline figures are mind-numbing. Chelsea were top of the pile with a staggering £16,771,328 slice of their resident oligarch’s fortune. Liverpool distributed £14,308,444 of John W Henry’s New England bounty.

Manchester City’s sheik, the chap with the bottomless purse, weighed in with £12,811,946. And the relentlessly unsuccessful Tottenham discovered £10,983,011 in their reclusive patron’s back pocket.

By comparison, Manchester United (£7,975,556) were a model of moderation, while even West Ham’s £6,380,339 looks a shade less offensive than it did at first sight.

Chelsea spent £32 million on Spain striker Diego Costa in the summer

No matter, the point is that 20 football clubs have passed over £115.2m which the game will never see again. It will purchase second homes, private education, exotic holidays and impossibly opulent motor cars for the aforementioned agents, but the game which generated those funds will receive not a penny.

Now you might think it impossible to make this unacceptable situation even worse, but the Premier League seem to have worked the trick. In a helpful explanation attached to these financial details, they explain: ‘The amounts shown include payments made by clubs on behalf of players.’

So the clubs have paid the fees which the players owe to their agents.

Effectively, they have rewarded agents for negotiating against them! It is quite beyond reason or belief.

When actors, authors or international sports people want to sell their services, they hire an agent to secure the best possible deal. In return, they pay that agent an agreed fee.

They do not expect their prospective employers to meet the bill, since they live in the real world. Yet football exists not only on a different planet, but in a different galaxy.

Agent Jorge Mendes (left) was involved in Radamel Falcao, Di Maria and Diego Costa deals

The clear winner in this year’s agents’ handicap was the indefatigable Jorge Mendes, whose portfolio includes Radamel Falcao and Angel di Maria to Manchester United, Diego Costa to Chelsea and Eliaquim Mangala to Manchester City.

Estimates of Mendes’ cut begin at £20m and keep climbing. No doubt he possesses a certain talent, but it is not one which causes the football public to drool. We are not discussing the equivalent of Cristiano Ronaldo (who happens to be another Mendes client).

No, Mendes is merely an agent, and he and his chums do a job which could be done equally well — and for a fraction of the fee — by an accountant and a lawyer.

Any other business might find that incredibly strange, even alarming. But football simply shrugs and chuckles and waits for the next burst of bank notes, which it will use to stuff the pockets of players, managers and agents.

Some would suggest it might more equitably be employed in reducing the cost of season tickets, programmes, even half-time tea and pies. Not a chance.

It simply never crosses the minds of those who take such decisions.

For football speaks the language of priorities, and its priority is to lavish its largesse upon those who are the least worthy of reward. Thus the ranks of pestilential chancers take home £115,261,136, and nobody charged with running the game seems to think it scandalous.

On reflection, I was quite unfair to Black Friday.

When set alongside the brazen profiteering of football agents, it was a model of frugal restraint.

Taxi for Mellor...he still fails to cut the mustard

Listeners to BBC radio sport in the 90s will recall the moment at six minutes past six on Saturday evenings, when a tune would blare and a plumply over-elocuted voice would begin to bluster.

David Mellor was putting football to rights. His opinions were forceful, provocative and totally untainted by knowledge; this team wasn’t ‘doing the business’, that player wasn’t ‘cutting the mustard’, these managers were ‘tactically naive’.

David Mellor said he is 'really, really sorry' for his verbal abuse of a London cab driver last week

We were reprieved for a few weeks in 1997 when he went to defend his Parliamentary seat. The electors of Putney emphatically rejected him. And so, at 6.06 on Saturday evening, we were greeted with: ‘Hello again! Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the airwaves, I’m back!’ Many people seemed to dismiss him as a harmless impostor who was using football to seek street credibility. But others perceived an edge of real nastiness in his sweeping, scornful judgments and glasses were raised when he left the programme.

Yet we wondered if memory was playing tricks. Was he really as awful as we believed? The answer arrived last week, in that tape of our hero’s altercation with a London taxi driver. ‘You’ve been driving a cab for 10 years, I’ve been in the Cabinet, I’m an award-winning broadcaster, I’m a Queen’s Counsel.

‘You think your experiences are anything compared to mine? I don’t want a lot of backchat, I don’t want to know how much you know about London because you don’t know as much about London as I do. Because you think you’re a big s***, having driven a cab for 10 years, you don’t need to worry about someone who has been in the Cabinet, who’s an award-winning broadcaster, who’s a Queen’s Counsel. If you think you’re going to be sarky with me, get a better education. Do you get any of this, my little friend?’

That was our Dave, still ‘doing the business’, still ‘cutting the mustard’. One of a kind, they say. Let us hope they’re right.

Question time just pointless with Sky 

With the heedless courage of men unafraid of appearing ridiculous, the Wales Rugby Union have complained to the BBC.

Their target is the Corporation’s immensely capable and experienced reporter Sonja McLaughlan. Before the match with New Zealand last weekend, she asked Wales coach Warren Gatland if the ritual of the Haka gave the All Blacks an unfair advantage.

Later, she wondered if Gatland felt under any pressure, after 22 consecutive defeats against the Southern Hemisphere nations.

And that is all it takes to upset the WRU: two perfectly reasonable questions which invite intelligent responses. You see, our major sports don’t expect that sort of thing from TV people. Of course, newspaper reporters are different; truculent oiks with dark agendas who take pleasure in embarrassing the great and the good.

But TV usually knows how to behave. After paying huge sums to acquire ‘the product’, they are normally at pains to protect their investment. So players, coaches, even seat-warming directors, must be approached on bended knee.

Sky Sports wrote the textbook on this one. Having stumped up the earth for the Premier League, they have apparently decided post-match interviews must be conducted this way.

Thus, after Tottenham’s recent victory at Hull, Christian Eriksen was squirmingly asked: ‘How much did you enjoy that winner, Christian?’

Christian said he had enjoyed it a lot.

It was faintly demeaning, wholly unrevealing and utterly pointless. And it demonstrated precisely why Sonja McLaughlan doesn’t work for Sky.

P.S.

The tributes arrived in a deep swell of sympathy for the farmer’s son, taken in the full bloom of youth. The death of a fine cricketer evoked the grief of friends and the distress of strangers. Yet even as we curse the cruel mischance which cut him down, we celebrate a rare and memorable talent. Phillip Hughes departed far too early, but he had left his mark upon his country and upon his sport. We mourn his passing.
