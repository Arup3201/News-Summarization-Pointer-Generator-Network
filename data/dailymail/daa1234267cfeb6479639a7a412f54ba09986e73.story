Bookmaker Paddy Power is gloating after its 'disgusting' Oscar Pistorius advert has now become the most complained about advert of all time.

Many of the record 5,525 complaints put to the Advertising Standards Authority were concerned the advert trivialised issues surrounding a murder trial, the death of a woman and also disability.

But when the MailOnline contacted PaddyPower for a statement about the distress the advert had caused it bragged: 'In your face KFC!'

Betting giant Paddy Power brought advertising into disrepute with its Oscar Pistorius 'money off if he walks' campaign that drew a record 5,525 complaints, the regulator has ruled

The Irish bookmaker, which is known for cheap pr stunts, is referring to a
 2005 KFC advert which saw call centre workers singing while eating and 
drew 1,671 complaints.

The
 betting giant's advert became the most complained-about UK campaign of 
all time two weeks ago, with thousands objecting to the offer of a 
refund on all losing bets if the South African Paralympian is found not 
guilty of the murder of his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.

The
 advert, which appeared once in The Sun on Sunday, showed an image 
similar to an Oscar statuette with the face of Pistorius, next to text 
stating: 'It's Oscar Time. Money back if he walks. We will refund all 
losing bets on the Oscar Pistorius trial if he is found not guilty.'

This week the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled that the betting giant brought advertising into disrepute with its Oscar Pistorius 'money off if he walks' campaign which drew a record 5,525 complaints.

It took the unusual step of ordering 
that the ad be immediately withdrawn while it investigated the 
complaints that it trivialised the issues surrounding a murder trial, 
the death of a woman and also disability.

Others
 complained that the ad was likely to cause serious or widespread 
offence and the ASA challenged whether it brought advertising into 
disrepute.

Paddy Power 
said that in the context of the high level of media coverage of the 
trial, it was 'unsurprising' that complaints had been received.

However, it 'strongly believed' that offering a market on a leading news story did not trivialise the issues surrounding the murder trial, death or disability.

It said the ad was a reflection of public interest, which was perhaps led by the media, and was not a commentary on death, violence or disability.

And while it accepted that there was a double meaning to 'if he walks', it did not go so far as to cause serious or widespread offence, but instead was an inoffensive and relevant play on words - adding that the company supported several sporting events that involved disabled athletes.

The Sun on Sunday said it had taken the decision to publish the ad in good faith and did not intend to cause offence to readers, but regretted that offence had been caused.

It said it would ensure the concerns raised were taken into account in relevant future decisions.

The ASA acknowledged that the ad made no explicit reference to death or violence.

But
 advertising rules stated that references to anyone who was dead must be
 handled with particular care, saying the ad was likely to be 
interpreted as making light of the issues surrounding the trial, which 
included the death of a woman who had been shot by her boyfriend.

It
 also considered that the text 'money back if he walks' and the refund 
offer was likely to be seen as making light of the serious 
decision-making process involved in the trial, while references to 
Pistorius's disability were also likely to cause serious or widespread 
offence.

The ASA said: 
'We acknowledged that the ad had appeared in the context of a high 
profile murder trial that had received extensive media coverage and was 
of interest to the public.

'We
 considered it would therefore have been reasonable to foresee that 
serious or widespread offence was likely to be caused by placing an ad 
that sought commercial advantage based on that trial and which made 
light of the sensitive issues involved.

'Given the content of the ad, and the prevailing circumstances at the time of its publication, we concluded that it brought advertising into disrepute.'

The ASA ruled that the ad must not appear again in its current form, adding: 'We told Paddy Power to ensure their future ads did not cause serious or widespread offence and did not bring advertising into disrepute.'
