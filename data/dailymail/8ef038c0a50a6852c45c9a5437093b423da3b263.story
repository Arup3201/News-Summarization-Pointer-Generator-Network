It's not a sight you would expect to see in the Vatican but these photographs show members of the tiny city state's police undergoing riot training.

Dressed in protective overalls with the logo of the Vatican police known as the Gendarmeria, the officers are seen wearing helmets and carrying shields as they are put through their paces by Italian colleagues.

The drill took place in the parade square of the police HQ just behind St Peter's and just hours after emeritus Pope Benedict XVI returned to the Vatican and moved into his new 'retirement home' - a converted convent, after spending more than two months at the papal summer residence outside Rome Castelgandolfo.

A Vatican source who witnessed the 
drill from an overlooking window and who asked not to be named, said: 
'It's not something I have ever seen before and I would't really expect 
to see the Gendarmeria involving in public disorder situations in St 
Peter's.'

The
exercise lasted several hours and involved the Vatican police force 
moving forward against trainers who acted as rioters throwing bottles, 
stones and petrol bombs.

In
another session Italian police officers held up large protective pads 
while the Gendarmeria moved forward using batons to beat the 'rioters' 
back.

There
are 130 members of the Gendarmeria and their main task is security 
within the Vatican but they are not in charge of protecting current Pope
Francis, with that task left to the Swiss Guard, although they may be 
asked to step in when he leaves the city.

They are armed and can be seen patrolling St Peter's Square keeping an eye out for numerous pickpockets who work in the area and who target the 18 million tourists who visit the Vatican each year.

Technically the Gendarmeria are also supposed to monitor public order in the Vatican but as the Catholic Church teaches to 'turn the other cheek' it's would seem highly unlikely that they will ever be called into a riot situation.

St Peter's Square regularly attracts several hundred thousand people every Sunday morning for the Pope's weekly sermon and the number jumps when their is a special religious event or for the election of a new Pontiff or funeral and enthronement but there has never been any rioting.

The source joked: 'There is talk of Pope Francis cutting salaries and bonuses for employees as he continues with his desire for a more humble Vatican and maybe he's getting ready for a violent reaction from them.'
