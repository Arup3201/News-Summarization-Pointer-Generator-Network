Twenty years on: Denise Fergus has said life is still a struggle following the death of her son James Bulger

The mother of James Bulger is to appear in person at the parole hearing for one of her son’s killers for the first time to plead that he is not released.

Denise Fergus said her message will be that Jon Venables ‘is still a danger’.

Venables has been freed before but was locked up again after being caught with child pornography.

‘He was given a second chance and blew it,’ said Mrs Fergus ahead of the 20th anniversary of James’s killing tomorrow.

‘The images he had on his computer were disgusting and I strongly believe he should not be released.’

Venables and his friend Robert Thompson were ten when they abducted, tortured and murdered two-year-old James in 1993.

They were detained for a minimum of eight years and released with new identities in 2001, but Venables was jailed in 2010 after being caught with child pornography on his laptop.

He has served his sentence and a parole hearing is scheduled to take place within the next couple of months to see whether he should be released.

Mrs Fergus, 45, said she will be submitting evidence, gathered with the help of her solicitor, that Venables is an ‘undiagnosed psychopath’ who should not be held in a mainstream prison but treated in a psychiatric hospital.

‘People say children aren’t born evil, but I believe Venables was,’ she added.

‘He proved that after he was released with everything that was found on his computer – sick images of children as young as two. To kill a child and have those images, he can’t be right in the head.’

Mrs Fergus, of Kirkby, Merseyside, said the parole board had a duty to consider evidence, gathered by the police at the time of James’s murder but never presented to the jury at the trial, which suggested her son had been sexually assaulted before he died.

She added that she was disgusted to learn that her son’s killers had both applied for as much as £50,000 compensation for their phones being hacked by the News of the World.

‘They are getting paid for murdering my son. If they hadn’t killed him they wouldn’t have had their phones hacked,’ she said. 

Mrs Fergus, who is divorced from James’s father and has remarried, added: ‘My life is still a struggle without James. People ask me if I can ever forgive Thompson and Venables, and the answer to that is No.’

She has set up the James Bulger Memorial Trust to provide respite for children and parents who have been the victims of bereavement or crime.
