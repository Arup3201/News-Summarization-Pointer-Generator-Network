Sir Bradley Wiggins returns to track racing for the first time in six years, believing he is a stronger athlete after his time on the road.

The 2012 Tour de France winner last competed on the track at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.

He has returned to the velodrome, but will only race in the 4000m team pursuit with Steven Burke, Ed Clancy and Andy Tennant. It is the only cycling event which is also in the Olympics.

Focused: Sir Bradley Wiggins returns to the track for the first time since 2008

Leading the way: Sir Bradley heads his team-mates at the Velodrome

Two teams of four complete 16 250m laps, each starting on the opposite side of the track. The aim is to set the fastest possible time over the 4000m race, with riders taking turns to lead their team.

Who are the ones to watch?

All eyes will be on Sir Bradley Wiggins, who returns to track cycling with his 2012 Tour de France victory still fresh in the mind. Australia are likely to be England’s closest rivals.

Did you know?

The World Record of 3:51.659 was set by Team GB at the London Olympics in 2012. Ed Clancy and Steven Burke, part of that record-breaking team, ride for England.

Sir Bradley, 34, said: ‘I dropped everything else. I thought, “Just focus on the Olympic event rather than try to be too greedy”. It’s the only Olympic event that’s available to me now the individual pursuit has been removed from the programme. So I thought I’d put all my eggs into the one I’m going to try and do for the next two years.’

He has won three Commonwealth silver medals but never a gold.

‘I’m a lot stronger than I used to be in the event, which is one of the things the road has given me,’ said Sir Bradley. ‘The initial thing, having been away for so long, was whether I could still do it, and the signs were really good.’

Sir Bradley is tied with Sir Chris Hoy as Britain’s most decorated Olympian, with seven medals, and will race at a velodrome named after the Scot.

‘I’d be a bit p****d off if I were him,’ said Sir Bradley. ‘They’ve stuck a great big Emirates sign over his name and it doesn’t stand out that it’s the Sir Chris Hoy velodrome. Stick a whopping great statue outside. He won’t complain because he’s far too nice. So I’ll complain for him.’
