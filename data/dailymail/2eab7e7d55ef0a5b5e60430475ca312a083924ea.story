At least 35 inmates of an overcrowded Venezuelan jail have died and 20 more were in comas last night - after what officials said was a mass drug overdose by prisoners who stormed an infirmary.

But pressure is building on the government to fully investigate the rising number of deaths at David Viloria Prison in Lara - with human rights activists questioning the officials’ story of what happened.

After days of conflicting reports from the government and relatives, the scale of the tragedy became clearer as authorities said 20 of the 100 inmates still being treated for intoxication were in comas.

The government has said the troubles at the prison began last Monday with a hunger strike for better conditions, when a group of violent inmates raided the prison infirmary.

They, they are said by officials to have drunk a deadly mix of pure alcohol with drugs used to treat diabetes, epilepsy and high blood pressure.

William Ojeda of the ruling socialist party said, after visiting the jail, that many of the intoxicated inmates were drug users with withdrawal symptoms due to the prison's strict regime of abstinence.

Prisoner rights activists have doubted the official version, saying that as deplorable as Venezuela's jails are, no inmates would voluntarily end their lives or poison themselves as a form of protest.

The lack of information and access to the prison has added to the mystery, with family members wondering whether loved ones could have been poisoned to restore order.

Ligia Bolivar, a human rights expert at Andres Bello Catholic University in Caracas said ‘counting the deaths now requires going to the morgue’ as government information is so incomplete.

President Nicolas Maduro has yet to comment, even as calls for a thorough investigation have come from Roman Catholic Church leaders in Venezuela and from the United Nations human rights agency.

On Thursday, police arrested the jail's warden, Julio Cesar Perez, who is expected to be charged in connection with the deaths.

Overcome by emotion: An inmate's relative cries while waiting for information outside the prison

The government says the situation at the prison is under control after it called in the National Guard and transferred hundreds of inmates to other facilities.

All prisoners' rights are being respected, said Nr Ojeda, who is president of a congressional committee that oversees the penitentiary system.

Venezuela's prisons are among the world's most violent. 

Overall, the country's 32 correction facilities are the fifth most-crowded in the world, housing almost three times their intended capacity, according to the London-based International Centre for Prison Studies.

The prison population has doubled since 2008 as a result of rampant crime and stiffer mandatory sentences.

The David Viloria jail is named for a guard who was one of 58 people killed at the facility last year during the second-deadliest prison riot in Venezuela's history.

The prison, previously called La Uribana, was built to hold no more than 850 inmates but was believed to be holding around 3,000 when the latest disturbances broke out.

Last year, 506 inmates died in the country's jails, according to the Venezuelan Observatory of Prisons, a watchdog group.
