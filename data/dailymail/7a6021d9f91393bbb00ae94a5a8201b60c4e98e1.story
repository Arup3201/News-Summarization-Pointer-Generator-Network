Liverpool are after a £10million deal for Bayer Leverkusen midfielder Emre Can.

The 20-year-old has been on their radar for two years after impressing scouts at a tournament in Mexico.

Germany U21 star Can is a powerful, left-footed player who is good on the ball.

Done deal: Liverpool have confirmed the signing of Bayer Leverkusen's Emre Can

He can also play in defensive positions. 
He joined Leverkusen from Bayern Munich last summer, and the Bundesliga 
winners have a first-option buy-back clause that could yet scupper any 
talks.

Liverpool have watched Leverkusen several times this season, with 18-year-old Julian Brandt also impressing.
