It may have been rated 'excellent' by the school inspectors, but when it comes to spelling, it seems Sheffield High School ‘must do better’.

A sign outside the private girls' school proudly announced that the Independent Schools Inspectorate had given it the top rating in every category - or rather, every 'catergory', as the glaring typo on the sign put it.

Staff at the £11,000-a-year school spotted the mistake and the sign was quickly taken down - but not before a passer-by had taken a photo, which was duly splashed across social media.

Two 'R's: The offending sign was snapped by a passer-by and has done the rounds on Twitter and Facebook

The sign read: 'Sheffield High School 2013 Inspection Report - "Excellent" in every catergory [sic.] - "Outstanding" Early Years', and it has been widely tweeted and emailed.

The school, which caters to pupils aged between four and 18, admitted its blunder and tweeted sheepishly: 'Yes, we know about the sign. We took it down as soon as it was spotted - but not before the photo was taken #redfacesallround.'

According to the school's website, the latest report by the ISI - the government body which rates private schools and is the equivalent of Ofsted in the state sector - declared that 'pupils receive an excellent education so that they leave the school as strong, open minded and confident women who are independent and who use their initiative'.

Headteacher Val Dunsford said the plan had been to refurbish the sign to celebrate their inspection report.

She said: 'Unfortunately the sign-writer completed the work over the weekend, making an error when copying from the agreed wording and spelling.

'We were only made aware of the spelling error on Wednesday morning when a parent alerted us to it, and it was corrected immediately.

'We are amazed by the amount of attention this has attracted when all we wanted to do was celebrate our amazing inspection results.

'The message has certainly gone out far and wide. This will be a lesson to all our school community to always check spellings carefully.'
