Athletes in Sochi are facing an unusual difficulty for a Winter Olympics - trying to stay cool in the soaring temperatures.

Organisers are struggling to keep the event on track as a heatwave in the Black Sea resort shows no signs of weakening. 

The unseasonal warmth has already caused 
competitions to be postponed or rescheduled because of melting snow and 
deteriorating skiing conditions.

Athletes have been complaining of soft snow on the slopes as Sochi is on course to be the warmest Winter Olympics ever.

Nowhere in the Olympic park is expected to fall below freezing over the next few days, according to forecasters.

But spectators are making the most of the heat by topping up their tans and heading to the beach between events.

Temperatures at the cross-country course
 are expected to reach up to 15C (59 F) today; even warmer than at the women's
 10K race on Thursday.

That kind of heat is almost unheard of at a cross-country race, giving rise to the unusual spectacle of sleeveless skiers on the course.

The first ski cross training session 
was cancelled on today, the latest victim of mild temperatures which 
touched 15C in the afternoon.

 was more Swiss joy in the mountains when Dario Cologna won his second 
cross-country skiing gold medal by prevailing in the 15km classic.

The men's Alpine skiing super combined, contested on another dazzling day in the Caucasus mountains towering above the resort town of Sochi where the Olympic park is located, was affected by the heatwave.

Swiss Sandro Viletta was the surprise winner ahead Croatia's Ivica Kostelic, who took silver, and Italy's Christof Innerhofer in bronze.

Bode Miller, who won the event in 2010, finished sixth, and was one of several athletes to complain about soft snow conditions caused by unseasonably mild weather throughout the Games.

Organisers moved the event start time forward to 10am, which experts believed would suit Miller's skiing style.

'If
 they started at 11 everybody has crappy snow more or less,' Miller said
 after a disappointing downhill section.

'But it's always in hindsight 
you can make those calls.'
