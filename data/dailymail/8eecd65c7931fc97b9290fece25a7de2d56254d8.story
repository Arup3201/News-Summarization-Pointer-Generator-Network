Do you dream of a wedding that comes complete with bulldog best men, an expensively customised horse drawn carriage and a romantic full moon - even when the real one is on the wane?

Enter Don Antonio Polese, a man famous in his native Italy for throwing the most lavish weddings in a country, and who has provided everything from ship cakes to champagne swimming pools for his well-heeled brides and grooms.

But despite the outrageous demands, bevvies of bridezillas and exhaustingly long days, Don Antonio says he still loves weddings - and is just as much of a romantic as ever.

Main man: Don Antonio Polese is the man behind some of Italy's most extravagant weddings

'Our work is nice because we are 
involved in one of the happiest days of people's lives,' beams the larger-than-life Don Antonio.

'One groom said to 
me once: "I want to live the fairy tale, I want to live my story" and we 
do live their stories. This is a beautiful thing, no?

Don Antonio, who owns the luxury La Sonrisa hotel in Naples, is now bringing his blingy brand of wedding to British TV screens courtesy of fly-on-the-wall series, My Crazy Italian Wedding, which is currently showing on TLC.

In it, Don Antonio shows off his formidable powers of persuasion, grasp of small details and a touching willingness to go to ridiculous lengths when it comes to keeping his brides happy.

'We were doing a ceremony by the pool and there was no 
moon that night but he bride said she wanted one,' remembers a chuckling Don Antonio.

'So we had to provide the bride and groom with a moon, which we did by contacting a hot air balloon company and hiring a balloon, which we then used to light up the pool.

'We put it between the Sonrisa's two towers and roped it in place. The bride and groom were very pleased.'

Bizarre though it might sound, a balloon moon is by no means the only unusual request, with cakes shaped like ships, swimming pools filled with champagne and bulldog best men all among past demands satisfied by Don Antonio.

'We always try to please everyone,' he adds. 'We've had a lot of strange requests but we never say no to anything.'

Not that that means Don Antonio won't diplomatically steer the bride and groom away from bad taste requests.

'I don't always go along with their ideas,' he smiles. 'I try to persuade them to have something a bit different if needed.

'We always try to, you know, make them see
 our point of view.' He pauses and adds: 'Iâ€™m very good at convincing people I can handle such
 situations.'

Balloon moons notwithstanding, what most Italian brides and grooms want, says Don Antonio, is a personal affair - even if that means travelling huge distances and moving heaven and earth to get what they want.

'Once, a bride asked us to get a particular type of orchid called Cattleya, which can only be found in Thailand,' he remembers. 'We had to fly there just to pick up these Cattleya.'

Other expensive requests focus on food. 'The 
other day, one bride asked us to get in those Norwegian crabs, those big 
crabs which we then had to cook according to a special recipe.

'In the end, we had to go to Florence to get them because our supplier didn't have any - they were flown in by plane from Norway.'

Despite the crazy requests, Don Antonio says he still loves his job and describes himself as a 'romantic'.

'I love the party and the moments of joy,' he beams. 'We
 get to be part of the most 
beautiful moments of people's lives.'

And what about British, American and Australian brides planning weddings this year? For them, Don Antonio has one simple piece of advice.

'Come and marry in Naples,' he chuckles, a cheeky smile lighting up his face. 'Come and celebrate at the Sonrisa. You will have the perfect wedding - I guarantee it.'
