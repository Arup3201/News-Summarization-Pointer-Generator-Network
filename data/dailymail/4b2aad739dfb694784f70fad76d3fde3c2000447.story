The champagne corks were popping in the Rovers Return as Coronation Street hosted its first ever real-life wedding in Manchester.

Andy Daniel and Paul Johnston made history as the first to be married inside the Rovers at the old Granada Studios set in Manchester.

The set, where Corrie was filmed for 53 years before moving to its new home on Salford Quays, is now a visitor attraction, and bosses successfully won a wedding licence in June.

It allowed Andy, 37, and Paul, 33, to say 'I do' behind the bar of the famous soap pub, before guests were led out onto the Corrie cobbles to toast the newlyweds.

Andy, an events organiser, said: 'We’re both big fans of the show and I think anyone born or living in the UK knows Coronation Street, which makes it such an iconic venue.

'We wanted to do something totally different for our wedding, and you can’t get much better than marrying in the nation’s most famous pub.'

Paul said: 'My background is in TV journalism so I’ve written about plenty of soap weddings, so it seemed entirely apt to have one of my own - although we were hoping there wasn’t quite as much drama involved at ours than in the soaps!'

Paul and Andy, who live in Islington, London, asked about holding a wedding on the set after it became an official visitor attraction in April.

Tour operator Continuum decided to get a marriage licence for the set after a number of other requests.

Once they had the necessary permissions they went back to Paul and Andy to see if they wanted to become the first to marry there - and there are already two more weddings planned before the site is set to close in October.

Andy and Paul, who have been a couple for 12 years, were joined by friends from across the UK for the civil ceremony on Monday evening. And they admitted that at first their friends thought they were joking about the location.

And when Paul went to register their wedding, even the registrar didn’t believe him.

He laughs: 'When I said we were getting married at the Rovers Return on Coronation Street there was a raised eyebrow.

'Then when I told them that the Manchester registry office is on Albert Square I think they thought I was really taking the mick,' Paul says referring to the address of the Manchester Register Office, which happens to have a soap-related link.

'They said "you’ll be telling us the reception is at the Woolpack next"!' adds Paul.

The newlyweds excitedly posed for their wedding pics up and down the cobbled street, and reminisced about their favourite soap weddings over the years.

Paul said: 'I absolutely loved the wedding of Karen and Steve McDonald, where Tracy Barlow arrives, reveals she’s pregnant, and it all kicked off with a stiletto.'

Andy added: 'Mine would be when Becky McDonald got too drunk to get married - but we’re not planning that to happen today!'

Cheers! The couple pop open a bottle of Champagne to celebrate
