One of Britain’s best-known quangos has spent millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money on redundancies, while hiring more than double the number of staff that it let go, figures reveal.

Information released under Freedom of Information laws shows that Ofcom, the communications watchdog, has spent £9.4million making workers redundant over the past five years.

But over the same period it has hired 598 staff – more than twice the 223 who have been let go.

There is increasing concern over the costs of making thousands of civil servants and quangocrats redundant.

As much as £1million a day has been spent on generous payments to departing bureaucrats, the vast majority of whom have taken voluntary redundancy.

Research suggests that nearly half of all departments are increasing their headcount, despite the Government’s pledge to freeze public sector recruitment.

Freedom of Information requests to Ofcom by the TaxPayers’ Alliance campaign group will heighten suspicions that savings are being wiped out as more staff are taken on.

They showed that in 2010-11, the organisation made 148 staff redundant, but it hired 153 staff the next year. And in 2011-12, Ofcom rehired two members of staff it had previously made redundant, taking one back permanently and another on a fixed-term contract.

In total, the quango employs around 735 people and over the past five financial years – 2007-08 to 2011-12 – it has spent £19.2million on temporary staff.

Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Poor planning by Ofcom has left taxpayers needlessly footing a redundancy and recruitment bill of millions.

Chief: The 2012/13 budget for Ofcom - run by Ed Richards, a former member of Tony Blair's policy unit, on a salary of almost £400,000 - is £121.4million

‘The Government is failing to deliver on its promised recruitment freeze both at this quango and across Whitehall.

‘Redundancies and their subsequent pay-outs impose a large short-term cost on taxpayers, yet taking on new staff a year later will wipe out any savings that could have been created.’

Ofcom said some short-term roles had been created ‘to help ensure the smooth running of wireless communications for the Olympic and Paralympic Games’.

But Mr Sinclair said: ‘Ofcom should have used existing staff to cover any increased Olympic duties before going through this costly firing and hiring process.

‘It’s deeply worrying that the regulator in charge of communications can’t be trusted in its stewardship of taxpayers’ money.’

The 2012/13 budget for Ofcom – which is run by Ed Richards, a former member of Tony Blair’s policy unit, on a salary of almost £400,000 – is £121.4million.

By 2014/15, Ofcom says it will deliver a 28.2 per cent real terms reduction in its expenditure and says increases in staff costs result from its redundancy programme, not an increase in salaries.

It has also insisted many employees have left voluntarily, leading to an overall fall in its headcount.

A spokesman said: ‘Ofcom is in the middle of a four-year programme that will deliver 28.2 per cent real-term savings by 2014/15.

‘Overall, staff numbers have fallen in recent years, from an average 789 in 2007 to 735 in 2012 – this is in spite of new duties recently granted to Ofcom, such as regulating postal services and helping to reduce online copyright infringement.’
