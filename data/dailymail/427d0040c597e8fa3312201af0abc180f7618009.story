The stepfather of a nine-year-old girl who survived for nearly two days trapped inside a crashed car tragically died while trying to hold her in his arms.

Jordan Landon’s screams for help went unanswered for 43 hours as she was stuck 16ft down a ditch in the overturned vehicle with below-freezing temperatures.

Doug Landon, 39, was trying to save her right up until the last minute by keeping her protected in his arms, his friend Kevin Brinson said.

Tragic: Nine-year-old Jordan Landon and her father Doug Landon, 39, captured on CCTV at a gas station minutes before their horrific accident in North Carolina

Last journey together: Father and daughter leave the garage with snacks on a quick errand which turned into a tragedy

And in an agonising twist her own mother crashed just 500ft away whilst out searching - but nobody spotted their wreck.

A passer-by finally noticed the car by
the roadside in Cove City, North Carolina as night began to fall for a 
third time around them.

‘He was curled up in a ball with his arm right across his chest and his other arm pushed out across Jordan,’ Mr Brinson said.

‘He was trying to hold her and trying to keep her protected, he was a good father’.

It took rescuers more than an hour to 
cut Jordan out of the 1995 Chevrolet Monte Carlo but Mr Landon was 
declared dead at the scene.

Rescuers revealed that Jordan was wearing a coat which helped as temperatures fell to around 30F (-1C).

Terror crash: Highway patrol rescue nine-year-old Jordan Landon who was trapped under a car next to the body of her dead father in Craven County, North Carolina for two days

But all the food she had was some cold pop tarts and Gatorade, which she nibbled on and rationed until rescue came.

‘We had to use a 
ladder to get down to the car and when Jordan was cut free she was 
emotional and she was crying about her step father'

CCTV footage shows she and her father visited a convenience store in Cove City at around 10pm on Friday.

As they made the two mile journey home
they came off the road on a bend and crashed into some trees before 
their car slid upside down and 14ft down a ditch and out of sight.

The crash collapsed the roof of the 
car and mangled the doors in such a way that Jordan was unable to get 
out of her front passenger seat, but could move around a little.

Her mother Claudette Leohmann reported
her missing on Saturday and had her own smash up on Highway 55 a mere 
500ft from the car Jordan was trapped in.

Sgt David Clifton of North Carolina 
Highway Patrol said that it was possible that Jordan would have heard 
the siren on his patrol car and seen the lights, even if he did not see 
her.

Rescue effort: After two days under a crashed car in bitterly cold temperatures, nine-year-old Jordan Landon escaped with only minor injuries

It was not until 5.30pm on Sunday that
a passer-by found Jordan’s car and within an hour she was being 
airlifted to a county hospital.

'It’s unfortunate for Jordan’s family they have lost one person but it is lucky Jordan is alive'

She was treated for non life-threatening injuries and is now in a stable condition.

Sgt Clifton said: ‘We had to use a 
ladder to get down to the car and when Jordan was cut free she was 
emotional and she was crying about her step father.

‘Even though he was not her biological father she considered him to be her dad.

‘She was emotional about losing him 
and the firefighters who pulled her out were also emotional: they are 
volunteers and live close by and it affected them a lot.’

Sgt Clifton added: ‘It’s unfortunate for Jordan’s family they have lost one person but it is lucky Jordan is alive.

Crushed: A rescuer watches as the wreckage is removed from the car accident scene in North Carolina where a father, 39, died

‘She is going to need a large amount 
of counselling for going through something that traumatic but hopefully 
she is young enough to recover.

‘To have the foresight to ration her food and water like that is amazing and heroic for anybody, but especially a nine-year-old'

‘To have the foresight to ration her food and water like that is amazing and heroic for anybody, but especially a nine-year-old.

‘She was able to keep herself calm. 
The family member next to her is obviously deceased so that's a lot to 
deal with, plus being dark at night’.

Sgt Clifton added that Jordan could 
have been found sooner had a member of the local fire crew taken his 
usual Saturday walk right by them, but he decided not to.

According to U.S. reports the 
speedometer on the car she crashed in was stuck at more than 100mph, but
Mr Landon’s friends have denied he was speeding.
