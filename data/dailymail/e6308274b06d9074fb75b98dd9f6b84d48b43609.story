Lionel Messi continues to be one step ahead of his opponents off the field as well as on it, with the Barcelona star avoiding being caught by son Thiago and puppy Toby while riding his own exclusively designed scooter.

The 27-year-old - who has already scored on seven occasions for the Catalan giants this season - took time out to have a go on his Space Scooter as Thiago and Toby frantically looked to chase him down in the garden of their home.

The Lionel Messi Space Scooter has proved to be a big hit across the world since going on sale earlier this year.

In May the four-time World Player of the Year signed a three year contract with Dutch Space Soccer.

The Argentine has since helped design and promote the special edition of the cool scooter under his own brand name, which retails online at £139.99 ($179.95).

The scooter is no ordinary piece of equipment, with it able to be propelled into the air using its special mechanical deck plate, moving the scooter up and down as though you're on the moon!

Not that Messi needs any type of lift off after a scintillating start to the season for Barca.
