Heroic: MP Stephen Gilbert spotted what he thought was a body in the Thames while he was on the House of Commons terrace

A quick-thinking MP was involved in a dramatic rescue of a woman from the river Thames near Westminster.

Stephen Gilbert was attending an event on the House of Commons terrace - which overlooks the river - when he saw what he thought was a body floating past.

But when he saw the body move, he reacted quickly to throw a lifebelt into the water.

The woman was then able to grab the safety device before being rescued further downstream.

Liberal Democrat Mr Gilbert, who was at an event for bus operators, was left shaken by the incident.

He said: 'What looked like a body just floated past. Then I saw that the person then moved and I followed them down the terrace.'

A number of life rings are kept along the terrace at the Palace of Westminster and Mr Gilbert, the MP for St Austell and Newquay, threw one into the river.

He said: 'There are some lifebuoys on the terrace, I guess this is not the first time something like this has happened.

'I didn’t expect for the person to move and then I didn’t expect to have to react to get them a lifebuoy.

'She disappeared towards Westminster Pier and she was rescued near to that.'

Mr Gilbert said the shock had left him 'barely able to string a sentence together'.

The Metropolitan Police confirmed that a woman had been pulled from the river near Westminster Pier, just yards from the House of Commons.

Result: The quick-thinking MP, who announced his act of heroism on Twitter, pictured, threw a lifebelt into the water so the woman was able to grab hold of it. She was later rescued downstream

A spokesman said: 'The woman was rescued from the water by the RNLI, the marine policing unit was also involved.

'She has been taken to hospital by London Ambulance Service.'

Mr Gilbert wrote on Twitter: 'Shaken after seeing a body float past House of Commons terrace - she moved, I threw a life-buoy and she’s now been rescued! #Result.'
