Donald Trump has no doubt that his son Eric's wedding to Lara Yunaska will go off without a hitch, despite her recent horse riding accident.

The billionaire businessman told MailOnline that 'it's going to be interesting' for Lara, who broke both wrists from falling off a horse last week, to fit her casts into her dress at the wedding on November 8.

'She'll either disguise it, or else she'll hold it up proudly. That'll be interesting, right?' he said.

The show must go on! Donald Trump has no doubt that his son Eric's wedding to Lara Yunaska will go off without a hitch in two weeks, despite her recent horse riding accident

Trump added that even though her wrists are injured,  it won't have any effect on exchange of rings. 'At least her fingers are exposed. So the ring is good,' he said.

'It's too bad,' he said of the accident. 'But she's really strong, and they dig each other, so that's important.'

After she sustained her injuries last Thursday, 31-year-old Lara posted a handful of understandably morose photos of her bandaged wrists to Instagram, captioning one: 'Wedding countdown: 2 weeks and 2 casts to go! #HopeImAFastHealer.'

This is an optimistic outlook, since a broken wrist typically takes between six and eight weeks to heal.

Optimistic: 'She'll either disguise it, or else she'll hold it up proudly. That'll be interesting, right?' he said of the casts she has to wear for two broken wrists sustained from falling off a horse

I do: Trump added that even though Lara's wrists are injured, her fingers are fine - which means it won't have any effect on the wedding ring exchange

Pushing forward: When asked whether it will affect the wedding plans, the real estate mogul said: 'I don't think so. Naah. No, they're not going to change any of it'

Still, the whole family seems to be remaining positive. 'She's doing fine. She fell off a horse, she hurt her wrist, but it's fine. It's not a big deal,' said Trump.

'She's got a cast on it, a small cast on it. And she'll be just fine. No big problem.' When asked whether it will affect the wedding plans, the real estate mogul said: 'I don't think so. Nah. No, they're not going to change any of it.'

On Monday, Lara confirmed that she would be getting married as planned by posting a snap of herself on a horse, with the caption: 'There are inherent risks that we all take in life. When you truly love something, it's worth it.

Positive: On Monday, she posted on Instagram: 'I wouldn't take back one day of riding - stuff happens. I will ride again and it will be better than ever. Most importantly, I still get to marry the love of my life on Nov 8th'

Wedding bells: Lara and Eric, who have been together for six years, announced their engagement last July

'I wouldn't take back one day of riding - stuff happens,' she added. 'I will ride again and it will be better than ever. Most importantly, I still get to marry the love of my life on Nov 8th.' 

And the bride-to-be shared the same sentiment with her future father-in-law. 'I asked her that question, is she going to keep riding horses, and her indication was, yes, definitely,' said Trump.

Lara, a former personal trainer and now associate producer for Inside Edition, is known to be an avid horse enthusiast, often sharing photos of herself with her prized horses from her home in Westchester, New York.

Lara and Eric, 30, announced their engagement last July. Over the summer they revealed that the wedding would take place at the Trump-owned Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, on November 8. 

The couple, who have been together for six years, will begin the wedding festivities with a wine tasting at the Trump Winery on Friday November 7, followed by the black-tie ceremony on Saturday and a brunch on Sunday.

Eric, who is the youngest of Donald's children with his first wife Ivana, proposed to Lara last July at the Trump Seven Springs estate in Bedford, New York.
