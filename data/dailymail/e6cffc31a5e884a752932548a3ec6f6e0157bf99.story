The kind-hearted New York police officer who hit the headlines a year ago when he famously bought a pair of boots for a homeless man has got his just deserts – a promotion at work.

Larry DePrimo won a host of fans last November when a photograph of him kneeling down to give a pair of boots to a homeless man in Times Square went viral and sparked a massive response, with thousands on social media hailing him as an example of the transforming impact of a simple gift. 

On Tuesday, DePrimo who was nicknamed Boots by his colleagues after last year's incident was promoted to detective.

Reason to celebrate: Kind hearted NYPB officer Larry (Boots) DePrimo has been promoted to detective a year after he made nationwide news for buying a barefoot homeless man a pair of boots

Act of kindness: Hundreds of thousands of people expressed their appreciation for Officer Lawrence DePrimo last November after the NYPD posted this photo of him on Facebook

‘It’s a dream come true, this shield is one of the most coveted shields I think in the country, maybe even the world,’ he told the New York Post. ‘I look down and it’s still unreal to me.’

In the wake of last November's incident, DePrimo had appeared on the Today show, where he had credited his 
grandfather with instilling in him the importance of generosity.  

‘I really didn’t think about the money,’ he said. ‘I said, I don’t care what the price is. We just got to help him out.’

DePrimo had also described the media attention his good deed received as 
‘surreal and extremely humbling.’

DePrimo said he hasn’t seen 'homeless' Hillman since his act of kindness
last November, but said he would still like to meet up with him

‘It’s
a great experience,’  he said last year. ‘I think it’s a lot about the people, 
though, because you see such great comments. People are saying that 
their faith in humanity is restored and that’s the biggest thing that I 
can take away from all of this.’

The homeless man was later identified as Jeffrey Hillman, 54. He was spotted just days later without the famous boots which he claimed might get stolen if he wore them.

Hillman has been 
spotted as recently as March still shoeless and with a 
sign that reads 'HOMELESS' while panhandling for money in 
the streets of Manhattan, even though he lives in a Bronx apartment.

DePrimo hasn’t seen Hillman since his act of kindness, but said he would still like to meet up with him.

'Hopefully I’ll be able to meet him and see how’s he doing,' DePrimo said. 'I’d shake his hand and ask him if he still wants to grab that coffee or some dinner.'

Responding to a need: Officer DePrimo said he was patrolling Times Square in the heart of Manhattan when he came across the man, who was huddled next to a storefront with nothing on his feet

Though
that famous incident gained DePrimo a lot of recognition, his father, 
also Larry DePrimo, was quick to point out that it wasn't the only 
reason that he was promoted.

'It’s
important to remember Larry is not becoming detective today because he 
done something nice a year ago, his service record also speaks for 
itself too,' he said.

When DePrimo appeared on the Today show last November he was joined by Jennifer Foster, the 911 dispatcher from Pinal County, 
Arizona, who had captured the heartwarming photo on her phone and then 
emailed it to the NYPD.

'I knew what I was looking at,' she said. ‘I knew it was remarkable.’

DePrimo has cited the influence of his grandfather in motivating him to step forward to engage with the man in need.

'The true inspiration was my 
grandfather, and he told me when I was much younger, "If you are going 
to do something, do it 100 percent. And do it, or don't do it at all,'" 
DePrimo said. 'And I think that stuck with me my entire life.'

DePrimo was on counter terrorism 
patrol in Times Square on the night of November 14, 2012, when he encountered the 
homeless man who was huddled next to a storefront with nothing on his 
feet.

The 25-year-old told
CBS that he spotted the man shivering on the cold pavement. 'I went up 
to him and I said, "Buddy where's your socks, where's your shoes?"' 
DePrimo said. 

New York Police Officer Lawrence DePrimo and Jennifer Foster, the woman who captured the moment he gave a barefoot homeless man a pair of new boots, were interviewed on the Today show last November

'He said, "It's okay officer, I never had a pair of shoes." And that to me - it took me back a few.'

'It was freezing out and you could see 
the blisters on the man’s feet, I had two pairs of socks and I was still cold.’

He watched the man stand up and walk slowly, painfully, down the cold pavement of the sidewalk on the balls of his feet.

The
officer went into a nearby Skecher's store and found a $100 pair of 
winter boots that he believed would keep the man warm through the 
winter.

Jose Cano, the assistant manager at 
the Skechers store in Times Square, said he discounted the Alamar 
Terence shoes from $100 to $75 as he was 'inspired'.

Mr Cano, 28, said: 'I've worked in the city for about 10 years and no one’s really sort of taken that sort of initiative.'

Officer DePrimo said he keeps the $75 receipt from the 
boots in his bullet-proof vest, as a reminder that even when things are 
tough, some people have it tougher.

‘The
two things that really stuck out in my mind that night was how cold it 
was and that this was the most polite gentleman I ever met, and I knew I
had to help him,’ he told TODAY. 

DePrimo
said he only told his family about the incident at the time, and was 
surprised when a friend told him the photo was posted on the internet 
some time later.

He has 
been on the NYPD for 2 1/2 years and is assigned to the Sixth Precinct, 
encompassing Greenwich Village and the West Village, and lives on Long 
Island with his parents.

At the time DePrimo received a set of cufflinks from Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly as thanks for his acts of kindness.
