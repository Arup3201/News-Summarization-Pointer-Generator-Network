Subway riders every where heed warnings to stay away from the tracks, but one Boston parkour expert decided that this time, he didn't want to listen.

In an Instagram video posted Thursday, Dylan Polin, parkour expert and now daredevil, is seen flipping over the subway tracks at the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority Park Street Station.

Polin posted the clip of his stunt Thursday but actually performed it at the end of December.

In the post accompanying the video, Polin writes in part: 'Been dreaming of this for years. Finally gapped the red line train tracks. Huge way to end 2014.'

Polin has been practicing parkour for nearly 10 years and he told Boston Magazine that his Park Street station stunt is something he has been wanting to do for a long time.

'I spent the last few months getting mentally prepared for it,' Polin said, 'and then me and a couple of buddies went down there and I just did it.

'I’m pretty happy about it. I got it out of my system, that’s all I needed to do.'

But not everyone is 'happy about it.'

MBTA officials were not too pleased with Polin's death-defying stunt.

'There is nothing impressive nor cool about it. An incredibly foolish and extraordinarily stupid act,' MBTA spokesperson Joe Pesaturo told Boston.

Polin disagrees, he said he was well trained and prepared to make the jump.

'I had a friend on either side to make sure I wasn't going to run into anybody or hit anybody on the other side,' Polin said according to WHDH. 

'I waited for the train to come and pick everybody up. If I thought I was going to get hurt I wouldn't have tried it.'

The MBTA stated that Transit Police detectives are investigating the incident, FOX reports. 

Polin usually posts his parkour exploits on his Instagram and YouTube pages. His subway jump video has amassed more than 200 'likes' on Instagram and he has nearly 300 subscribers on YouTube.
