On the eve of a game most Premier League managers  might be watching old tapes of their opponent's previous matches, or adding the final touches to the next day's gameplan - not Jose Mourinho, though.

The night before Chelsea welcome Tottenham to Stamford Bridge for a midweek clash under the lights, Mourinho was attending a lingerie fashion show in London.

Mourinho was pictured arriving at the Victoria's Secret event at Earl's Court Exhibition Centre on Tuesday night alongside his wife Matilde Faria and daughter Matilde.

It is the first time the catwalk show, which featured performances from singers Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift and Ed Sheerhan, has been hosted in London and it will air in the US on December 9.

If the Chelsea boss was having any worries about how his side were going to preserve their unbeaten start to the season against Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham, he put them to one side for the evening as he enjoyed making his appearance on the 'pink carpet'.

Chelsea came up against a dogged Sunderland on Sunday as they drew 0-0 at the Stadium of Light and made it 13 without loss in the Premier League, but Mourinho says his side's focus is on winning games, not avoiding defeat.

'One thing is that I don't think it's possible (to complete a season unbeaten). The other thing is that we are not playing for that.

'If (against Spurs) we have a 0-0 with 20 minutes to go, we are not going to play for the 0-0 to be undefeated after 21 matches. No way.

'If you play for that, if that is one objective, maybe you draw so many matches, you don't take risks to try and win matches. You are happy just to be undefeated.

'If you get 10 draws, you get 10 points. If you win five and lose five, you make 15 points.

'We are going to play matches to win. And, sometimes, we will lose.'
