An Australian carpet layer is accused of murdering a women he met on Tinder who plummeted 14 floors from his apartment after the pair had rough sex during a night of heavy drinking.

Gable Tostee was last month charged with the murder of New Zealand tourist Warriena Wright, 26, after she fell from the balcony of his apartment in Gold Coast, Queensland, on August 8. Tostee has denied the charge. 

A judge on Monday described the charge of murder against Tostee as 'difficult' because the 28-year-old was not on the balcony at the time Ms Wright fell to her death.

An alleged account of Ms Wright's final hours by police claims Tostee held Ms Wright in a 78-second long stranglehold and may have made her drink 'vodka' brewed from a homemade still inside his Surfers Paradise apartment before her death.

A transcript of an audio recording found on Tostee's phone has been submitted by Queensland Police in documents to Brisbane Supreme Court in opposition to a bail application by Tostee. 

The transcript of the three hour and 19-minute recording, which covers an eight hour period, allegedly documents Ms Wright's tryst with Tostee, heavy drinking, a violent argument and her fatal fall.

The recording spans an eight hour period of time from when Tostee met Ms Wright up until the early hours of the morning as he was sat with his father in a parked car awaiting legal assistance

The documents claim Ms Wright used her online name Cletus to set up a date with Tostee on the mobile dating app in Surfers Paradise on August 7.

It is alleged the pair were captured on CCTV at 8.45pm meeting outside a surf shop before going to a shop to buy beer. They then allegedly go to Tostee's apartment where they socialise and drink.

Gable Tostee was an active Tinder dater in the months leading up to his meeting Warriena Wright on August 7

It is alleged the pair were captured on CCTV at 8.45pm meeting outside a surf shop before going to a shop to buy beer. They then allegedly go to Tostee's apartment where they socialise and drink 

Documents submitted to the court claim the recording found on Tostee's phone started just before 1am, and 20 seconds into the recording a male voice says 'F*** me', the Brisbane Times has reported.

Sounds of groaning can be heard, then the male tells the woman she is being too rough during sex, and says 'I don't like being beaten up'.  

According to documents submitted by police to the court, the sounds of a struggle begin at about 2.10am after the sound of drinks being poured had been heard a few minutes earlier.

Over the next few minutes the argument gets worse and at 2.13am the sounds of a struggle are interspersed with his swearing and her saying 'OK, it is all good' while she sounds out of breath.

During the 10 minutes leading up to 2.21am he calls her a 'god damn psycho' twice and there are further sounds of the struggle.

In an outline of submissions for the Crown case, the alleged facts say that at 2.17am, after he tells her 'get up, get up' and she says, 'I am so sorry', 'there are sounds consistent with the deceased being held down and her airway restricted. Her breath is clearly laboured. [Tostee] continues to talk ... saying repeatedly 'you don't understand'.

The transcript of the three hour and 19-minute recording, which covers an eight hour period, allegedly documents Ms Wright's tryst with Tostee, heavy drinking, a violent argument and her fatal fall

'There are sounds of slapping and [Tostee] saying "let go, let go". The sounds of restricted breathing coninue for 78 seconds and only stops when there is the sounds of something dropping and then [Tostee] complains about her trying to hit him.

'At this stage the deceased's airway is no longer restricted and she starts yelling out "no" repeatedly.

'This escalates in crescendo and anxiety and there are sounds of the balcony door being opened, and scuffling consistent with [Tostee] dragging the deceased towards the balcony.'

The Crown continues: 'This part of the struggle' takes just under one minute, commencing 'at 2.19.48am and continues until 2.20.46am, at which point the door can be heard slamming shut leaving the deceased on the balcony and [Tostee] inside the unit.

'The last thing said before the deceased is outside the balcony is her screams intensifying as she screams "just let me go home".

'[Tostee] says in a very aggressive tone, "I would but you have been a bad girl".

'Her voice becomes more muffled and it is apparent she is on the other side of the door.

'At 2.21.12am, one hour, 24 minutes and 25 seconds into the recording, a scream can be heard that fades, consistent with the deceased falling.' 

Police have claimed Tostee taunted Ms Wright in his flat when she threatened to call the police after discovering her iPhone was missing

At 2.23am, according to the court transcript, Tostee says 'F***, f***, f***' before getting dressed and letting himself out of his apartment and then through the basement of the Avalon Apartments and onto the street.

Between 2.31am and 3am, he appears to be walking on the road, with the sound of traffic, other people and finally, at 3.08am, a night club.

He arrives at Domino's Pizza at around 3.10am and can be heard eating his slice of Supreme at 3.11am.

He continues walking until 3.22.56am, when he rings his father, Burleigh carpet salesman, Gray Tostee.

Gable tells his father, 'There a million cops around my building, I'm f****d'. and for the next 20 minutes they discuss what has happened as Mr Tostee negotiates where to pick up his son, who appears seriously panicked about being spotted by police.

Tostee tells his father he is at Domino's and then cites other locations in Cavill Mall, including Melba's, the Mantra buildings, and describes what he is wearing.

Gray Tostee appears to pick up Gable in the driveway at the Circle on Cavill, a shopping area at the base of two landmark Gold Coast towers in Surfers Paradise, the Mantra buildings.

The conversation continues in the car, in which Gable tells his father what has happened:

'I tackled her down inside on the ground inside the apartment ... God I hope that she is not dead.'

Gable Tostee expresses his anxiety about contacting their lawyer and about his father stopping the car at a service station or shopping centre, saying 'just go to a house, there are cameras at servos' and 'just like park next to some bushes ... park on the street next to a fence that way no one will see'.

At 4.04am he says, 'if anything is wrong it would show up on the news wouldn't it?'.

At 4.15am, Gray Tostee parks the car.

Seven hours later, Gable Tostee accompanied his lawyer, Michael Purcell, to Surfers Paradise Police Station and declined to make a statement. 

According to the court documents, forensic police are still analysing the illegal still which is believed to be the source of the home-made vodka referred to in the recording.

Mr Tostee continually refers to drinking and his special 'vodka' and the couple discuss sex, body parts and alternative religions and beliefs before the alcohol-fuelled row, according to the court documents.

In the court documents, the Crown notes 'deceased's voice sounds progressively more slurred' during the evening following the drinking of what may be the 'home made vodka'.   

Police have opposed the bail application for Tostee, saying he contacted more than 250 girls on Tinder in the months before he allegedly murdered Ms Wright

A judge on Monday described the charge of murder against Tostee as 'difficult' because the 28-year-old was not on the balcony at the time Ms Wright fell to her death.

Considering Tostee's bail application in the Brisbane Supreme Court, Judge Debra Mullins asked Crown Prosecutor Sarah Farnden, 'The prosecution case is that the applicant wasn't on the balcony that Ms Wright fell from?'.

'That appears to be the most likely scenario,' Ms Farnden said.

Tostee has been in custody since mid-August when he was arrested and charged with murder.

'If your client was not on the balcony, it makes the murder case a lot more difficult,' Justice Mullins told the accused's barrister, Anthony Kimmins.

'But in the context of what happened in the apartment, I would think a manslaughter case is not weak.'

It is alleged the pair were captured on CCTV at 8.45pm meeting outside a surf shop before going to a shop to buy beer. They then allegedly go to Tostee's apartment where they socialise and drink

Justice Mullins postponed the bail application, requesting more information after she read sworn statements by police, Tostee and Tostee's parents about his autism diagnosis.

She said his previous diagnosis of being on the autism spectrum was referenced in the Crown's material, but was not addressed in defence documents.

She said a diagnosis of autism on Tostee could have a bearing on how the court viewed what allegedly happened inside his apartment on the night of August 8, when Ms Wright fell 14 storeys to the pavement below.

Police have opposed the bail application for Tostee, saying he contacted more than 250 girls on Tinder in the months before he allegedly murdered Ms Wright.

A document filed in the bail application says: 'Police hold a strong belief that if Tostee is granted bail, he will recommence his using social media.

'Police believe Tostee's blatant disregard for human life and his propensity of violence displayed in this instance would place the safety of the community at an unacceptable risk.'
