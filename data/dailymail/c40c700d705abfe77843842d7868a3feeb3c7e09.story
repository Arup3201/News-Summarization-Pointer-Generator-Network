A daredevil from Petersburgh, New York created a slip n' slide you may not want to try at home.

The 300-foot-long homemade slip n' slide featuring a jump, a wall ride, and a drop-off into a river only cost Derek Salamanca $65.00 and a few minor injuries.

'First off, I only spent $65 on this,' Salamanca said.

Derek Salamanca took his go pro cam, a rool of plastic , and some cardboard and decided to film he and friends sliding down 300 foot massive slip n' slide

'It took me and my friends 40 hours,' said the DIY adventure expert.

After building the slippery creation, Salamanca filmed the ride with a GoPro camera.

The documented ride shows he and friends sliding through various obstacles, up walls, and dropping off into a river.

At one point, Salamanca's dog even decides to take a turn at the lengthy slide.

After sufficiently going down the slide a few times and ending up with a few bumps and bruises, Salamanca tells his Youtube audience of over 100,000 how he built the slide and what materials he used to create it.

Most of the materials Derek used were free cardboard and wood from a local warehouse

Yahoo News reports that the only supply Salamanca bought for the contraption was one 100 foot roll of plastic.

He was able to get cardboard palettes and other items for free from warehouses that were giving them away.

Salamanca also got some help from his mom who gave him rakes, shuttles, and a large plot of her land.

Even though Salamanca had a fun building his projects he says that others should proceed with caution.

'Obviously, it's at your own risk,' Salamanca says.

'I don't take any responsibly for your stupidity.'

If people decide to be 'stupid' he says that they can dig a deep V in the ground where they can place cardboard to stabilize the slide and give the slider speed
