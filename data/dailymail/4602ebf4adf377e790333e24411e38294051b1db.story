Chelsea have made another enquiry for Atletico Madrid defender Joao Miranda.

The 29-year-old Brazilian is valued at £20m by the west London club, but Atletico could be reluctant to let him go considering the losses they have already suffered in the transfer market.

Atletico have already rebuffed one approach by Jose Mourinho's club, but with the departure of David Luiz to PSG, Chelsea are keen to get in reinforcements.

Champion: Miranda won La Liga with Atletico Madrid last season and almost won the Champions League

The Spanish champions have already sold Diego Costa and Filipe Luis to Chelsea for a combined £48m.

Thibaut Courtois, who was on loan at Diego Simeone's side for the past three seasons, has also moved back to Chelsea, his parent club.

The prospect of then losing another key player from their title-winning defence would be a bitter one indeed but Atletico's financial problems are well documented and they could be willing to sell Miranda, were the right price to come in.

Transfer: Chelsea are said to be interested in £20m rated Miranda, having already signed Filipe Luis

Pricey: Atletico Madrid sold Diego Costa for £32m and defender Filipe Luis for £16m to Chelsea

New boys: So far Chelsea have already bought Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Filipe Luis from La Liga
