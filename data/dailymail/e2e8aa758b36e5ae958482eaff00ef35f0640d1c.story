It has a reputation as a rather po-faced Middle England town, typified by the famed fictional letter writer ‘Disgusted, of Tunbridge Wells’.

Now the good burghers of the royal spa town want to inject a little cheer.

In an attempt to boost tourism, councillors are considering re-branding the town Funbridge Wells. Other slogans up for discussion include ‘Why not Tunbridge Wells?’ and ‘Cultural Capital of West Kent’.

Cultural Capital of West Kent: Councillors want to re-brand Tunbridge Wells to make it more appealing

The council says a slogan will help ‘guide its development strategy’ and are also looking to ‘make the most’ of famous quotes about Tunbridge Wells.

Among the quotes being examined as possible mottos for the council include one from David Lean’s Lawrence of Arabia in which head of the Arab Bureau Mr Dryden says: ‘On the whole, I wish I’d stayed in Tunbridge Wells’.

Another line, from 007 movie On Her Majesty’s Secret Service starring George Lazenby in which Bond girl Tracy Di Vicenzo - played by Diana Rigg - tells Bond that she ‘looks forward to living as Mr and Mrs James Bond of Acacia Avenue, Tunbridge Wells’.

And yet one more line from H.G Wells’ book Christina Alberta’s Father in which he wrote: ‘Tunbridge Wells is Tunbridge Wells, and there is nothing really like it upon our planet.’

Nothing like it: The council is looking to make the most of famous quotes about the town

Cllr John Cunningham, who sits on the think tank, said a new motto was important to attract tourists to the area, but said that he was not a fan of Funbridge Wells.

He said: ‘A motto would be good. We have got so much for tourists to see, but I think Funbridge Wells is not on - I wouldn’t pick it myself.’

Councillor Francis Rook said: ‘I think we should leave it to the younger and vibrant members of the council to think about taglines.

‘I think it is important that the borough council informs people of the fantastic diversity and culture and history we have in the area.’

Cabinet member for tourism, leisure and economic development, Jane March, said: ‘It will involve a lot of people but it’ is at a very early stage and we are still formulating.’

Local Richard Spicer, 54, said: ‘Tunbridge Wells needs to get rid of its fuddy duddy image of people always complaining and never being happy with life.

‘The place is packed full of bars, theatres, restaurants and all sorts, so we need to use that to bring people in - I don’t really like Funbridge Wells, but it’s better than the rest of the ideas.’
