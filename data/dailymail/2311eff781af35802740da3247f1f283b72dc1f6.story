Sportsbet will be praying for a miracle after a publicity stunt involving a floating, inflatable Jesus put the betting giant in hot water.

Commuters in Melbourne were taken by surprise on Tuesday morning when a 46-m high replica of Brazil's iconic Christ the Redeemer statue was spotted hovering in the skies.

A Sportsbet spokesman said it was a show of support for the Socceroos on the eve of the World Cup.

Church leaders have labelled Sportsbet's show of support for the Socceroos World Cup campaign as 'offensive'

But church leaders have labelled the ambitious promotion 'offensive'.

Victorian Inter-Church Gambling Taskforce chairman Mark Zirnsak said it demonstrated the depths Sportsbet was willing to sink to in pursuit of profits.

'They would have known that the use of Christ the Redeemer to promote their business would be offensive to most of the Christian community' he said.

'What is truly offensive is they would have calculated that the controversy they have caused will give them hundreds of thousands of dollars of free advertising in the media.'

The 48-m floating replica of Christ the Redeemer was seen by commuters over the Melbourne skies

A Sportsbet spokesman said the reaction to the floating replica has been generally positive

Sportsbet spokesman Will Byrne said the floating Messiah aimed to generate support amongst Australians ahead of the Socceroos' World Cup campaign.

'We’re actually supporting the Socceroos and asking fans to #KeepTheFaith as we need some divine intervention to progress in the World Cup,' he said.

'We wanted to make it loud and clear that we are backing the boys in Brazil and what better way to do so than with Australia’s largest ever balloon floating above the Melbourne skyline.

'It’s always hard to predict how people will react to such a public display of support but...the positive reactions have definitely outweighed the bad.'

This year's FIFA World Cup will kick off on June 12 with games being played in 12 cities across Brazil, including Rio de Janiero, Brasilia and Sao Paul.
