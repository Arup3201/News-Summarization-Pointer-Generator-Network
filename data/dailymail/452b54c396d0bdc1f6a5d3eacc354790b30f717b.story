A mother has warned parents of venomous spiders after her daughter, four, was bitten in her bedroom and left with a swollen leg and red rash which spread over her body.

Penny Jordan, 38, called paramedics after a red patch on her daughter Elle's body began to spread from her leg to her stomach and neck, her foot ballooned and she developed a fierce temperature.

Doctors have confirmed that a spider was responsible, and Ms Jordan says she has no doubt that Elle was bitten by one of the 'huge' creatures she has seen at her home in Northfield, Birmingham.

Rash: A red patch on her daughter Elle's body began to spread from her leg to her stomach and neck, her foot ballooned and she developed a fierce temperature

'They're huge,' said the mother-of-seven. 'But because they come into the house from outside, there is not a lot we can do. I have six grandchildren. I don't want the same happening to them.'

In recent weeks a number of larger than normal spiders have been spotted across the country as the warm summer has meant the spiders have had more to eat, and have not been killed off by falling temperatures.

Ms Jordan and her partner Pete Hands had noticed the rash on Elle's body on Sunday afternoon, and called for an ambulance.

'I want to make parents aware that a simple insect bite can have serious consequences,' she said. 

'I was horrified as the rash spread. It looked like she'd been severely scalded. They were just like burn marks.' 

Suffering: Elle, who was forced to pull out of her first full day primary school on Monday, had woken up with a livid red patch on the top of her leg

Elle, who was forced to pull out of her first full day primary school on Monday, had woken up with a livid red patch on the top of her leg.

Within hours, it had spread over her body, and her temperature was rising.

Her parents took the child to a walk-in medical centre where staff discovered a bite was to blame and prescribed a course of tablets.

However, the medication did nothing to stem the rash and when it moved to Elle's neck paramedics were called.

Ambulance staff helped make Elle comfortable, but she did not need to go to hospital. 

'At first we thought Elle had been bitten outside, but I've seen some very large spiders in her bedroom and wonder if one of those attacked while she was asleep.'

Britain may not be noted for its dangerous creatures, but is home to 14 spider species that can deliver a painful bite.

Most venomous is the false widow, which has moved to this country from abroad, but bites from cupboard, woodlouse, lace weaver, black lace weaver, wolf, bark sac, stone, cross, money and wasp spiders can also be painful.

To blame? The family suspect that Elle was attacked by a giant house spider, similar to the one pictured, which are common visitors to homes in autumn and often found in baths

The family suspect that Elle was attacked by a giant house spider - a common visitor to homes in autumn and often found in baths. They can grow to five inches and possess a potent venom, but do not usually strike.

Spider expert Professor Adam Hart explained the surge in sightings.

'This year has been seemingly a good one for the invertebrates which spiders feed on, and it's quite mild out there,' he said.

But he stressed the spiders do more good than harm, providing a free pest control service. 

'They often feed on the most common species, preventing a few species from becoming dominant,' he said.

'We want to encourage people to respect and learn more about their little house guests.'

There are three types of allergic reactions to stings or bites: minor localised, large localised and systemic. The latter is potentially life-threatening.

'If you have a large localised reaction after being bitten or stung by an insect, a large area around the bite or sting will swell up,' said an NHS spokesman.

'The area may measure up to 12 inches across, or your entire arm or leg could swell up.

'The swelling will usually last longer than 48 hours, but should start to go down after a few days.

'You’re more likely to have a systemic reaction if you’ve been bitten or stung before and become sensitised, particularly if it was recently.'
