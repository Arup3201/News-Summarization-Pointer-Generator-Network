A third of homeowners admit to regularly spying on neighbours and half say they peek behind curtains whenever they hear 'goings-on' in their street

One in three homeowners admit they regularly 'spy' on their neighbours, it emerged yesterday.

And nearly half say they peek from behind the curtains whenever they hear 'goings-on' in their street.

Almost 50 per cent of people surveyed said they could recite the times their neighbours leave and return from work and spot a new car immediately, with a fifth noticing if a stranger visits.

Noticing parcels being delivered, if a couple argue more than normal or even when the online shopping comes, were other common aspects people knew about those living close by. 

But one in ten admit they had been caught peering through the windows by their neighbour.

The study of 2,000 adults – commissioned by Yale as part of National Home Security Month – found that the most common reason given for keeping tabs on the neighbours was 'to check they are all right'.

For neighbours even the intimacy of a relationship is common knowledge - over a quarter knew a neighbouring couple were having real troubles and one in ten even know a neighbour currently having an affair.

Nigel Fisher, from Yale, lead sponsor of National Home Security Month, said: 'This shows just how closely the people who live next to us are watching and the things that don't go unnoticed.

'However, the results show that where people did admit to keeping tabs on a neighbour it was usually with good intentions of making sure everything's alright.'

The study also saw a quarter of people confess to spying on the neighbours at least once a week.

While a third admit they rush to the window if they hear a strange car pull up.

A nosy four in ten regularly peer out of the curtains and thirty per cent had looked out of the window of a dark room to watch undetected.

Almost half of those surveyed said they could recite the times their neighbours leave and return from work

And 45 per cent said they were very familiar with their neighbours habits and daily routines.

While some have even had cause to speculate that a neighbour was pregnant - such was their level of observation, while being au fait with next door's evening trips to clubs or taking the kids to activities was common.

1. Changes to the house

2. A new car

3. Times leaving for work and arriving home

4. Overall patterns

5. If a stranger visits

6. If a couple are arguing

7. They get an internet food shop delivery

8. Whether a neighbour might be pregnant

9. Evening activities during the week

10. If they have flowers delivered

The neighbours are often watching and while it's good to have another eye on their property, over a fifth finds their neighbours to be too nosy.

Results showed that four in ten adults have caught their neighbours watching them from a window when they're in the garden, whilst others peek over the fence or listen in on conversations when in earshot.

A frustrated 17 per cent have fallen out with their neighbours over their intrusive behaviour, with many admitting their neighbours seem more interested in the lives of others than their own.

Almost three in ten troubled homeowners have even confronted the people next door over their nosiness, though many said it made no difference to their snooping habits.

In fact, a third of those polled had neighbours that were so nosy it had led them to avoid that person wherever possible.

However, just under three quarters of respondents said that they would always raise the alarm and inform the homeowner if they saw something unusual occur on the property.
