Cruel thugs taped a pregnant dog's mouth shut around a firework before lighting it, shattering the animal's jaw.

The dog, which had been seriously abused before the attack, was left with missing teeth and burned fur. 

Vets caring for the animal, which they have named Chola, in the Mexican city of Torreon, fear she may now lose the litter of puppies she was carrying.

The pregnant dog was left with a burnt tongue and missing teeth when cruel thugs taped its mouth around a firework before setting it off. She is now recovering under the care of vets in the Mexican city of Torreon

They believe the animal was being used to train less aggressive breeds as fighter dogs before becoming pregnant. 

It is likely her abusers were trying to kill her when they discovered she was no longer of use to them, vets said.

'She was very badly hurt, it looks as if she may survive now but will no longer be able to have a life on the street and may well still lose the puppies,' said Vet Miguel Davila.

'Many of her injuries such a torn ear are old ones. We believe she was used as bait in dogfights but then became no use when she got pregnant.' 

The Animal Protection Association is offering a reward for anyone who might be able to identify those responsible for the attack. 

Vets believe the animal, which they named Chola, may have been used to train less aggressive breeds to fight before becoming pregnant 

Aside from the vet giving her medical care and those feeding her, experts are trying to minimise contact with the animal as she is so nervous around humans

'We have given her a name, called Chola, but to be honest we are avoiding as much contact with her as possible as she is extremely nervous of anybody that she doesn't know well,' said Rebecca Reyes, director of the Association.  

'She cannot swallow any food because her palate was burnt badly together with her tongue and so we have to feed her baby food liquidised.

'She also needs painkillers constantly and unless is tranquillised does not allow herself to be examined.

'The explosive device that she had in her mouth not only shattered part of the jaw but knocked out several teeth. It is lucky it didn't go into her lungs, somehow they seem to have been unhurt.'

Local police are appealing for donations to help pay for the dog's surgery and ask anyone with information about the attack to come forward.
