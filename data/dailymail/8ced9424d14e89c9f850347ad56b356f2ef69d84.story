A company that runs a reward scheme to boost children’s behaviour by giving them iPods and cinema tickets is being scrutinised by the gambling watchdog for allegedly running an illegal lottery.

Vivo Miles, the profit-making company which runs the scheme in hundreds of schools that allows pupils to amass points for good conduct that they cash in for products, began selling raffle tickets with prizes, including £300 iPads, in November.

One parent was so alarmed her seven-year-old son had entered a raffle she complained to the Gambling Commission, saying it was illegal for under-16s to buy such tickets.

The Commission refused to comment on individual cases but said: ‘We take any complaint regarding children and gambling seriously.’

Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers union, said running a lottery  for children ‘sent out the  wrong message’.

Vivo Miles’s managing director Adrian Burt said the raffles were a ‘trial’ that had been suspended and proceeds would go to charity.

Nearly 500 secondary schools, one in six, are signed up to the company's reward scheme, which is intended to replace old-style rewards such as stickers, gold stars and house points.

But the extent of incentives being offered in schools brought a warning last year that a generation of children is growing up expecting to be rewarded at every stage.

Many youngsters are collecting points for mundane achievements such as remembering to bring their PE kit and wearing the correct uniform.

The Vivo Miles system is designed to mimic a bank account, with Vivos the currency or ‘payment’ for hard work at school. The card is meant to be similar to a bank debit card and comes with a PIN which pupils use to check their points balance.

The team behind Vivo Miles says it teaches children personal finance lessons such as the importance of saving.

But Chris McGovern, chairman of the Campaign for Real Education, said the scheme amounts to ‘bribery’.

‘It misleads children into thinking anything which requires effort has to have a special reward,’ he said. ‘It takes away the incentive offered by education as an end in itself.
