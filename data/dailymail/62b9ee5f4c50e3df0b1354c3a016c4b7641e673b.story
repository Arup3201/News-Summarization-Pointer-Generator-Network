Nash Papyrus: The fragile fragment and some of the other most significant religious manuscripts in the world are being put online by Cambridge University

A digital version of a fragile 2,000 year old copy of the Ten Commandments will be put online.

The Nash Papyrus - one of the most significant religious documents in the world  - will be placed on the internet by Cambridge University.

It is among 25,000 new images made available by the university library.

Other manuscripts include one of the most remarkable ancient copies of the New Testament, The Codex Bezae, thought to date from the fourth century.

Another important historic text that has been released is the tenth-century Book of Deer, which is widely believed to be the oldest surviving Scottish manuscript and contains the earliest known examples of written Gaelic.

A thirteenth-century Life of Edward the Confessor provides an account of the early English saint and king and boasts masterpieces of English illumination, including a very graphic portrayal of the Battle of Hastings.

The extensive Cairo Genizah collections, which are being gradually released through the digital library, provide fascinating glimpses into the everyday life of a Jewish community in Egypt over a period of a thousand years. 

Based at the crossroads of trade and intellectual exchange, the archive of this community represents one of the most important sources for understanding the wider medieval world.

Cambridge is also beginning to release digital versions of its library's Islamic and Sanskrit collections, which include both secular and religious texts.

The Islamic manuscripts collection includes some of the earliest surviving Qur'ans, while the Library's Sanskrit manuscripts cover all the major religious traditions of South Asia and include some of the oldest known manuscripts of key religious texts.

The Polonsky Foundation charity has helped to fund the digitisation of much of the new content on the website.

It aims to make the world's intellectual treasures freely available to a global audience.

Anne Jarvis, university librarian, said: 'Cambridge University Library preserves works of great importance to faith traditions and communities around the world.

'Because of their age and delicacy these manuscripts are seldom able to be viewed - and when they are displayed, we can only show one or two pages.

'Now, through the generosity of the Polonsky Foundation, anyone with a connection to the Internet can select a work of interest, turn to any page of the manuscript, and explore it in extraordinary detail.'

The Cambridge University online library was launched last year and has already attracted tens of millions of hits on its website.

'Intellectual treasures': This picture shows the Codex Bezae - a codex of the New Testament written on vellum and dating from the 5th Century

Significant: This manuscript of an important Jain text - which contain the teachings of Mahavira - dates back to the 15th or 16th century

Globally available: The 16th Century Benedictional of Robert de Clercq, with an illumination by Simon Bening

The Nash Papyrus. Named after the Egyptologist who purchased it at the beginning of the twentieth century, the Nash papyrus is a very fragile second-century BCE manuscript. Before the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, it was by far the oldest manuscript containing text from the Hebrew Bible, and even now it remains among the most ancient.

The Codex Bezae is one of the most important New Testament manuscripts.

Containing the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles in Greek and Latin, it is thought to date from the late fourth or early fifth century. It is striking in containing many unique forms of the text, including, a saying attributed to Jesus found in no other sources, a longer ending that was added to Mark's Gospel and a strikingly different version of Acts.

The Book of Deer is a tiny pocket gospel book, about 16cm tall and 11cm wide.

Historic: A fragment of an Abbasid Qur'an, showing geometric ornamentation, which was probably written in the 9th Century

Book of Deer: The tiny pocket gospel book dates back to the 10th Century, and contains early 12th Century additions in Latin, Old Irish and Scottish Gaelic

This illustrated Buddhist text on palm leaf will also go up online thanks to the project

Usually dated to the first half of the tenth century, the manuscript is of particular importance to Scotland. It is widely regarded as the earliest surviving manuscript produced in Scotland and also contains the earliest examples of written Scots Gaelic, added to the manuscript in the twelfth century at the monastery of Deer in Aberdeenshire.

The Life of St Edward the Confessor by Matthew Paris celebrates the life of this important English saint and king. Sponsored by Henry III and possibly owned by Queen Eleanor of Castille, it is a masterpiece of thirteenth-century English illumination and political propaganda.

The Cairo Genizah Collection ). The Taylor-Schechter Cairo Genizah Collection is the world~s largest and most important single collection of medieval Jewish manuscripts. Obtained from a synagogue storeroom in Egypt in the late 1890s, the collection contains 193,000 manuscript fragments, obtained by a Cambridge professor, covering all aspects of life in the Jewish community at Fustat, near Cairo, over a period of a thousand years.
