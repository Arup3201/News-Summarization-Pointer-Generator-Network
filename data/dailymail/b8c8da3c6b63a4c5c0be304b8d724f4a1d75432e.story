He brought the world the brink of nuclear war but that hasn't stopped the former Cuban dictator Fidel Castro from being awarded China's version of the Nobel Peace Prize.

Hailing the aging revolutionary icon's 'important contributions' to world peace, he was selected to win the Confucius Peace Prize, the state-run Global Times newspaper reported.

'While in office, Castro didn't resort to violence or force to settle disputes in international relations, especially with the United States,' the paper wrote, seemingly forgetting the Cuban missile crisis.

Cuban leader Fidel Castro was awarded the Confucius Peace Prize China's version of the Nobel Peace Prize, on Tuesday. He was praised for his 'important contributions' to world peace 

Pictured with former Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev, when Castro allowed the Soviet Union to build sites for nuclear missiles on Cuban soil, it sparked a 13-day confrontation with the United States. It is widely considered the closest the Cold War came to escalating in a full scale nuclear conflict

The 13-day confrontation with the United States arose after Castro allowed the Soviet Union to build sites for nuclear missiles on Cuban soil in 1962. It is widely considered the closest the Cold War came to escalating into a full scale nuclear conflict. 

'After his retirement, he has been actively meeting with leaders and groups from all over the world and has made important contributions to emphasising the need to eliminate nuclear war,' the Global Times continued.

A total of nine judges from a panel of 16 experts and scholars picked the 88-year-old to win, it added 

However, the former communist leader who has been looking increasingly frail in recent years, did not collect the award in person. 

A Cuban exchange student received the prize on his behalf at the ceremony on Tuesday, one day before Malala Yousafzai and Kailash Satyarthi accepted their Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.

Miss Yousafzai became a household name after her campaigning for girls' right to education led to an assassination attempt by the Taliban two years ago, and has worked tirelessly as a human rights campaigner following her recovery.

She currently lives with her father, mother and two brothers in Birmingham, attending a local school. 

Castro who ceded power to his brother Raul in 2008 after a nearly fatal health crisis in 2006, has kept a low profile in recent years.

It even fuelled rumours that he may have died but he has made short occasional appearances. He has also written books and articles for the official press in Cuba.

Besting more than 20 nominees to win the Confucius Peace Prize, he beat other candidates including UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and South Korean President Park Geun-Hye, the Global Times reported.

Previous winners of the five-year-old award include Russian leader Vladimir Putin. 

The shadowy prize emerged in 2010, when it was suddenly announced by the panel two days before jailed Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel to Beijing's anger. 

Organisers of the prize denied links to the government, but the award's executive chairman Liu Haofeng told AFP later that it had been set up by an association overseen by China's culture ministry. 

The Confucius Peace Prize was established in 2009, seemingly with official backing from Beijing, shortly after the Nobel committee announced it was awarding the peace prize to Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo. 

The long time human rights activist was given the award in 2010 for 'his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China,' while serving his fourth prison term for inciting subversion of state power.

Chinese authorities were reportedly enraged by the decision.  

Perhaps the most famous winner of the five-year-old prize is Russian leader Vladimir Putin, who scooped the award in 2009. 

'This year's peace prize was given to him because his act this year was outstanding in keeping world peace,' a spokesman told the AFP news agency at the time.

Other winners include former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan and Yuan Longping, a Chinese agricultural scientist, known for developing hybrid rice varieties. 

Yi Cheng, a Zen master who is the honorary head of the Buddhist Association of China, was awarded it last year.
