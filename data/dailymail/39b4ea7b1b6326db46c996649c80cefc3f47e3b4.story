Republicans on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee won a vote Wednesday demanding the Justice Department criminally prosecute Lois Lerner, the former Internal Revenue Service official at the center of a scheme to slow-walk tax-exempt applications from conservative groups.

They claim she committed three federal crimes punishable by a total of 11 years in prison.

The panel voted 23-14, along party lines, to approve a letter instructing Attorney General Eric Holder to charge Lerner and prosecute her in court.

The Justice Department has said it already has its own investigation into the conduct of Lerner and other Obama administration officials in what has become known as the 'tea party scandal.'

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Former IRS Director of Exempt Organizations Lois Lerner (R) now stands accused of violating the constitutional rights of conservatives who applied -- and waited -- for the tax-exempt status that liberal groups easily won

Ways and Means Committee chair Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican, is retiring next year, making the Lois Lerner matter one of his final packages to wrap up

Lerner's attorney, William Taylor III, has told reporters that his client  met with DOJ officials and answered their questions weeks ago, but has heard nothing since.

President Obama seemed to pre-empt that inquiry's result on Super Bowl Sunday, declaring in a televised interview with Fox news Channel host Bill o'Reilly that there is 'not even a smidgen of corruption' at the IRS.

Republicans are hopping mad. Lerner has twice refused to answer questions in House hearings, claiming her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Congress has determined that she waived that right in May 2013 be defending herself in an opening statement.

The congressional committee met in secret because some of the material being debated consisted of private tax information protected by Section 6013 of the Internal Revenue Code.

They approved a criminal referral letter charging her with three crimes.

Lerner 'used her position to improperly influence agency action against only conservative organizations, denying these groups due process and equal protection rights under the law,' the committee said in a statement. 'She showed extreme bias and prejudice towards conservative groups.'

She 'impeded official investigations by providing misleading statements in response to questions from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration,' the statement continues.

And 'Lerner risked exposing, and may actually have disclosed, confidential taxpayer information, in apparent violation of Internal Revenue Code section 6103 by using her personal email to conduct official business.'

Eric Holder, the U.S. attorney general, has broad discretion and could choose to do nothing. He could also prosecute Lerner in federal court.

Tea Party Patriots, one of the groups the IRS targeted beginning in 2010 – with letters signed by Lerner – is hoping Holder will act.

'It's time to send a message to this administration that Americans will not stand for this kind of Banana Republic thuggery,' said the group's co-founder Jenny Beth Martin.

'[H]istory should never forget the shame brought upon this nation by the Obama administration’s lawless targeting of American citizens based on their beliefs,' she added.

Walls closing in? Lerner could receive 11 years in prison if the DOJ were to successfully prosecute her

One-two punch: While Ways and Means presses for a criminal trial, Rep Darrell Issa's House Oversight Committee is prepared a Contempt of Congress resolution against Lerner

Before her hasty retirement last fall, Lerner headed the IRS office in charge of vetting and monitoring nonprofits whose missions entitle them to income tax waivers.

Ways and Means Committee chairman Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican, released a lengthy timeline on Wednesday outlining Republicans' version of Lerner's activity.

Predictably, reactions to the latest step in the scandal were split.

'The evidence is clear and compelling that Lois Lerner, at the bidding of political special interest groups, abused her powerful position at the IRS to violate the civil rights of taxpayers,' Texas Republican Rap. Kevin Brady said Wednesday.

'While many of my constituents believe the Justice Department and Attorney General Eric Holder will turn a blind eye to the corruption at the Internal Revenue Service, I call on the Justice Department to prosecute this case.'

Democrat Sandy Levin of Michigan framed the issue as an election-year stunt.

'It now seems clear that Republican members of the Ways and Means Committee have decided that they do not want to be left behind in the Republican campaign to declare this a scandal and keep it going until November.'

GOP leaders in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee are running a parallel investigation. They are expected to vote Thursday on a motion to recommend a Contempt of Congress citation by the full House of Representatives.

That measure could be used to persuade a federal judge to order Lerner to testify before Congress.
