A fifth of all child and teenager deaths in England could be prevented, according to damning series of reports.

Researchers have found that a large proportion of the 5,000 infants, children and adolescents who die  in England and Wales each year could be saved.

A series of papers published in medical journal the Lancet has found that, although the child death rate in England is low relative to population size, too many youngsters are being let down by doctors or social services.

The number of preventable deaths in England has been branded a 'wake up call for healthcare professionals'

One paper showed that between 2010 and 2011, 20% of deaths of children and teenagers aged 18 and under in England could have been avoided.

Deaths that could have been prevented include many among newborn babies, youngsters with existing medical conditions and others killed by infections.

Dr Hilary Cass, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: 'We've known for some time that the UK performs badly compared to its western European counterparts when it comes to child mortality rates.

'But this paper reveals the startling fact that one in five child deaths in England could be prevented. This is a serious wake-up call for both healthcare professionals and policy-makers and we have to act urgently.'

President of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health Hilary Cass says the figures show policy-makers have to act urgently to save children

Preventable deaths were defined as 'those in which modifiable factors may have contributed to death' with causes including accidents, suicide, deliberately-inflicted injury, abuse or neglect, and acute medical conditions.

One of the papers found clear regional differences in child death rates around England and Wales. They tended to be higher in the Midlands and the North than in the South and East. The one exception was the North East, where death rates were relatively low.

Lead researcher Peter Sidebotham, from the University of Warwick, said: 'What these variations in mortality tell us is that more could be done to prevent child deaths across all age groups.

'Although some contributing factors are relatively fixed, including a child's age, sex, and genetics, many environmental, social, and health service factors are amenable to interventions that could lessen risks and help prevent future deaths.' 

For children aged one to four, the number of deaths per 100,000 of the population ranged from around 15 in the South East to 23 in the North West.

Among children aged five to 14, the rate varied between around eight per 100,000 in the East and South East to 10 in the North West and East Midlands.

Dr Sidebotham added: 'It needs to be recognised that many child deaths could be prevented through a combination of changes in long-term political commitment, welfare services to tackle child poverty and healthcare services.'
