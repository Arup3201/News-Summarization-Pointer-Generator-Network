Criminal: Ken Boonstra, 48, has been identified as the man who broke into a young couple's home and was killed during a struggle

An intruder who was stabbed to death after breaking into a gym owner's house had been planning to sexually assault his wife and video tape it, according to reports this week.

Ken Boonstra was stabbed to death by a 26-year-old woman while her husband struggled with him in their Washington home.

Police have now revealed that Boonstra, 48, had a camera and tripod in his pocket when he broke into the couple's home.

The couple, who own a local branch of a gym, are not being identified because they are the victims of a crime. The wife's mother and the couple's seven-month-old daughter were both in the home at the time of the attack.

The Seattle Times reports that the fatal early morning break in on May 13 was not the first time that Boonstra had been in the couple's home.

He went into the house 12 hours before the attack and threatened the wife, grabbing her by her ponytail and demanding all of her money.

She didn't get a good look at him because her hair was grabbed from behind, West said. She was slapped and punched in the face and suffered an ankle injury as she was dragged by her hair.

'This guy apparently grabbed her by the pony tail, swung her around, robbed her, and then either slapped or punched her in the face,' said Sgt Cindi West, spokesman with King Country sheriff's department.

At the time, that was $41 cash, and her left the house.

The wife called police to report the robbery and was understandably frazzled. The recording of the call hears the dispatcher tell her to take a deep breath and reassures her that police are on the way. She responds: 'I just want them to be here... I'm sorry, I'm just so scared.'

Fighting back: The couple, whose names are not being revealed because they are the victim of a crime, fought back against the attacker who had attacked the wife 12 hours earlier also in their home

The problem therein appears to be that he became familiar with both the house and the woman prompting him to return later that night with the apparent intention of sexually assaulting or abducting her.

The wife was not the only woman involved in the attack, as initial reports also stated that her mother was also involved, along with her husband.

The family went out to dinner that night and then went to bed by 10pm after 'triple checking' the locks on every door.

Hours later around 1.40am, the husband woke when their dogs started barking.

When he heard the dogs begin to growl, he ran back to get wasp spray which he used on the intruder with little success.

The wife originally came into the struggle armed with a baseball bat but that broke during the altercation.

Defending their home: The couple were in their Washington home with their 7-month-old daughter and the wife's mother at the time of the attack in May

'When the husband was fighting with the intruder, the wife was the one that went and got the knife, and stabbed the intruder, trying to help her husband out,' said West.

It took several stabs of the knife to get Boonstra to stop fighting.

'The overall circumstances indicate that the suspect may have entered the home this morning with the intent of abduction and sexual assault,' the police report read.

Police were able to confirm that Boonstra was the man responsible for the earlier break in because the wife had knocked off his hat during that struggle. DNA tests later matched the fibers on the hat to Boonstra's dead body.

Boonstra's mother told The Seattle Times that her son had been 'going downhill' ever since his divorce years earlier and police found a collection of videos posted to Youtube wherein he made religious and anti-women ramblings.

The intruder apparently was the same man who robbed the woman in the North Bend home Sunday - just 12 hours earlier

Before the inital break in, the wife had taken to Facebook to post her joy at celebrating her first Mother's Day with her baby girl, boasting of her incredible husband and saying she 'couldn't ask for anything more.'

The trainer at a Cascade gym was then deluged with messages of support from friend, with one declaring her a 'mother, protector, wife, business woman and heroine'.

The fit and healthy young couple have left their home to recuperate after their frantic night battle.

The couple had no significant injuries from the fatal fight, but a detective said they were likely sore because it was 'quite a struggle,' said King County sheriff's Sgt. Cindi West.

Buff: The couple owned a nearby gym

Investigators don't believe the residents know the intruder and there's nothing to indicate why the house was attacked. There's no marijuana growing in the home, for example, West said.

'We have not seen anything that would explain why this house was targeted,' she said.

Some neighbors speculated the man may have come from a homeless camp in some nearby woods.

'This is a weird deal, just a bizarre case,' West said.
