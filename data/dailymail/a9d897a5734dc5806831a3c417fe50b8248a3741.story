The father of a missing boy whose body was found off a Massachusetts highway says he was crushed to hear that his 5-year-old son's remains had been identified but is planning his funeral.

Jose Oliver tells the Boston Herald he was 'lost, angry and crushed' when the medical examiner called to confirm the body found Friday was his son's.

'I wasn’t hoping to find him like that — wrapped in a blanket in a suitcase on the side of a highway like he was an animal or something,' Jose Oliver told the Boston Herald.

Jeremiah Oliver was last seen in September but wasn't reported missing until December.

Found dead: A body recovered near a wooded area in Massachusetts on Friday morning has been confirmed to be missing five-year-old Fitchburg boy Jeremiah Oliver.

Tests: Massachusetts State Police stand along Interstate 190 where police said a child's body was found near Sterling

The little boy's body was found off a highway in central Massachusetts on Friday morning and it appeared that the child had been murdered.

The body had been wrapped in blanket-like material, and packed into a suitcase.

Before his body was found, Jeremiah's 
case led to criminal charges against his mother and her boyfriend.

There were also calls for changes within the state's child welfare agency. Three workers
 were fired as a result.

No new charges have been announced related to Jeremiah's death.

Jose Oliver lives in New Britain, Connecticut and says he plans to return Sunday to Massachusetts.

As word that Jeremiah had been identified spread, on Saturday people came to the Fitchburg street where he had lived, and about 100 people attended a vigil there last night.

'He was a little charmer,' said Sarah Wadkins, who said she had stayed at a family shelter at the same time as Jeremiah and his mother, Elsa Oliver. 'If he wanted something, he would turn around and smile and make your day. The world would brighten up.'

Jeremiah was last seen by relatives in September but wasn't reported missing until December. Authorities have said they feared he was dead.

The family was being monitored by state social workers at the time, and the case led to scrutiny of the state Department of Children and families.

Jeremiah's mother, Elsa Oliver, pleaded not guilty in March to charges including kidnapping, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, and reckless endangerment. Her boyfriend pleaded not guilty to similar charges. They have been held since December on lesser charges in the case.

The heartbreaking tale has been months in the making, as Jeremiah was reported missing in December when his sister told someone at her school that she and her siblings were being abused.

Unusual behavior: Elsa Oliver, seen here in December, began acting strangely and refused to speak to even her own lawyer

Emotionless: Elsa Oliver reportedly spoke to a relative recently and randomly interjected asking 'Is it the Rapture?'

The girl said that the last time they saw Jeremiah- which is said to be on September 14- his hand was bleeding and for unexplained reasons, his mother Elsa was reportedly worried that he would die as a result of the hand wound.

Elsa Oliver and her boyfriend Alberto Sierra, 22, were first brought into court in December.

Both Elsa Oliver and Alberto Sierra face multiple charges, including assault with a dangerous weapon (a belt), two counts of reckless endangerment of a child and two counts of being an accessory after the fact of a felony and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.

During the initial investigation a strange clue was offered when it was found that Elsa had a tattoo with a butterfly and the date 'Sept. 25, 2013' written below it.

Police have spoken to local tattoo artists because they want to know whether she told a tattoo artist why that date is significant.

Missing: The search had been going on since December although young Jeremiah Oliver has not been seen since September

It is not clear why it took three months for authorities to be notified of Jeremiah's disappearance, but an anonymous tip led them to believe that the mother's boyfriend may have had something to do with the alleged abuse.

The source said Sierra, 22, would bully and intimidate those around him, routinely becoming irate and even making death threats on more than one occasion.

Both Elsa Oliver and Alberto Sierra face multiple charges, including assault with a dangerous weapon (a belt), two counts of reckless endangerment of a child and two counts of being an accessory after the fact of a felony and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.

Jose Oliver said he plans to attend both trials to learn every detail of what led to his son’s death.

'There has to be a reason,' Mr Oliver said. 'I want to know everything that happened. You just don’t kill a 5-year-old.'
