Former footballer Clarke Carlisle has pleaded guilty to a drink-driving offence which happened just days before he attempted suicide.

The 35-year-old, who played for Leeds, Burnley and QPR, today admitted failing to provide a sample on December 20.

He also pleaded guilty to a charge of driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence on the same date, when police officers spotted his Mercedes travelling in an 'erratic' manner.

Former footballer Clarke Carlisle has admitted failing to provide a sample when he was suspected of drink driving. Days after he was pulled over by police, he attempted suicide

Carlisle still bears the facial scars from his December 22 suicide attempt in a crash which left him in a coma until mid-January.

The former Professional Footballers' Association chairman spoke clearly as he admitted the charges from the dock at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court in north London today.

Deputy District Judge Margaret Dodds told Carlisle  he would 'inevitably' be disqualified when he next appears at the same court for sentencing on May 14.

She also ordered that reports be made in the case after being told of Carlisle's medical situation.

The court heard he was spotted by police 'swerving' his Mercedes and nearly hitting another vehicle on Pentonville Road, north London, on December 20 at about 7am.

Prosecutor Zahid Hussain said the car was seen 'swerving in the lane, to the pavement on the nearside, almost mounting the pavement' and that the tyres were 'grinding on the curb'.

When the officers stopped and spoke to Carlisle 'alcohol was smelled on his breath', Mr Hussain added.

The court was told that Carlisle did not blow long enough in the breathalyser when he was tested at the roadside to provide an adequate sample.

Carlisle later said he fell into a spiral of decline after his contract as a TV football pundit was cancelled 

He was taken to Islington police station but would not co-operate and said: 'Sergeant, I would like to speak to my counsel first.'

The court was told that Carlisle had been involved in excess-drinking offences in 1999 and 2011.

Krystelle Wass, defending, told the court: 'Two days after the incident Mr Carlisle attempted suicide, which is why matters have taken some time to come to court.'

She said there were 'ongoing mental health issues'.

The deputy district judge replied that she would order reports ahead of the next hearing as 'he is clearly in some trouble'.

The deputy district judge told Carlisle that he would get credit for his early guilty plea but noted that he has a 'bad record'.

Carlisle, who was released on unconditional bail. said 'Thank you, ma'am' as he stepped out of the dock. 

The former footballer (pictured playing for Burnley) has previously told of past thoughts of suicide when his career was coming to an end and he suffered serious injury

The married father-of-three was  left critically injured when he was struck by a lorry near his home on the morning of December 22 on the A64, near York.

He later told how he threw himself in front of the lorry in an attempt to take his own life.

Carlisle said he felt his life was spiralling out of control after he was told by ITV he was losing his £100,000-a-year Champions League pundit role.

He said he went straight to a casino and blew his and his wife's savings.

He told The Sun last month: 'I had to die. This wasn't escaping or running away. This was the perfect answer. It made everyone happy and it ticked every box.'

He said he had sat in the police cell and concluded that he could not let his children 'have a criminal father'.
