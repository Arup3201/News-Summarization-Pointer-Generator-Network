Peaches Geldof said she ate McDonald's, pizza and chips every day until doctors warned that her junk food diet was putting her health at risk, it emerged today.

The 25-year-old admitted before her death she had cholesterol problems in 2011 and 'the heart of a 90-year-old gangster' so decided to lose weight.

She was found dead at her Kent country home on Monday in ‘unexplained’ circumstances and a post-mortem examination yesterday was 'inconclusive' about the cause.

Friends had said she looked thin before she died, leading to speculation her weight loss may have put pressure on her heart. She had said her juice diet helped her lose 11lb in a month.

'I had cholesterol and the doctors said stop eating s***. So I did. If you stop eating pizza and chips you then don't look like you used to,' she told The Sun at a film premiere in 2011.

'Do I really look that thin? Let's be honest. How did I do it? I just stopped eating McDonald's and f****** s*** every day.

'I used to eat s*** every single day. I used to wake up with my boyfriend and eat crap. I had the heart of a 90-year-old gangster.'

Today it was revealed Peaches Geldof's body has been released to her family so they can plan her funeral.

A post-mortem 
examination carried out at Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford yesterday proved 
inconclusive, prompting further investigations to try to establish her 
cause of death.

It
 is understood that police found no suicide note and no signs of injury 
or evidence of drugs.

Any inquest is not expected to be opened and adjourned by the coroner until after the results of the toxicology tests are known.

Her funeral is expected to be held at the Kent church where she married in 2012 and
 where her mother Paula Yates' memorial service took place in 2000.

Her
 father Sir Bob Geldof has also been spending time with her sons Astala,
 23 months, and Phaedra, 11 months, at the family home of his son-in-law
 Tom Cohen in south-east London.

The initial post-mortem findings came as fears grew that Miss Geldof may have suffered from an eating disorder like her mother Paula Yates, who died from a heroin overdose in 2000.

The BBC came under fire yesterday for its ‘excessive’ coverage of Peaches Geldof’s death.

Former anchorman Peter Sissons criticised the corporation for their report, which led Monday’s Ten O’Clock News.

The veteran broadcaster, 71, who presented the BBC’s evening news programme for ten years until 2003, said: ‘It’s the latest example of news values being infiltrated by the values of the entertainment industry.’

Television doctor Chris Steele said bulimic vomiting can create toxic levels of potassium in the body, which can cause heart irregularities or cardiac arrest.

The GP said pictures of Miss Geldof’s hands show damage which he believes could have been caused by her making herself sick.

He said: ‘Without any evidence but just to my eye, Peaches’ knuckles are darker than the rest of the finger and they are enlarged.

‘It is highly likely that it is from bulimia. That’s not bulimia of a couple of weeks’ duration, it is a long-term problem. I don’t know any other condition that causes that in the knuckles.’

Police were called to Miss Geldof’s £1million home in Wrotham, Kent after receiving a call raising concerns about her welfare.

The young mother, whose two sons are due to celebrate their first and second birthdays in a few days, was pronounced dead at the scene.

'Inconclusive': A post mortem has been held at Darent Valley Hospital, in Dartford, Kent, but a cause of death was not established

Peaches had a house in the country, worth nearly £1million, pictured, where forensic officers were searching for evidence

Evidence: A post-mortem is expected to be carried out at hospital tomorrow to establish the cause of death

Protective gear: Peaches' body was taken away on Monday night to Darent Valley Hospital in Dartford

Looking for clues: Forensic teams were spotted walking in and out of her home with trained sniffer dogs - but sources have said there was no signs of injury, drugs or a suicide note

Search: Wearing white overalls and masks, they could be seen carrying plastic bags away from the house

Just weeks before her death, Miss 
Geldof was named as a new columnist for Mother and Baby magazine. In her
 last piece, she wrote of how she was ‘happier than ever’ because of her
 ‘perfect’ life as the wife of musician Tom Cohen, and as the mother to 
Astala, 23 months, and Phaedra, 11 months.

Peaches was the second daughter of former Boomtown Rats singer Bob, 62, and Paula Yates.

She was just 11 when her mother died 
after struggling with depression. Poignantly, the last message Miss 
Geldof posted online on Sunday evening was a picture of her as a toddler
 with her mother.

A statement from Kent Police said: 
‘Officers continue to investigate the circumstances surrounding the 
death to compile a report for the coroner. The result of a toxicology 
report can take several weeks.’
