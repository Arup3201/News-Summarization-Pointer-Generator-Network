Victory: Labour's Alex Rowley benefited from a big swing away from the SNP

Labour has delivered a humiliating blow to the Scottish National Party with a resounding by-election victory in Gordon Brown’s backyard.

Jubilant Labour supporters said Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond had received a ‘gubbing’ at the hands of voters, following an 11 per cent swing.

The result is a further set-back for Mr Salmond’s SNP ahead of this year’s referendum on Scottish independence, which polls suggest he is on course to lose.

The by-election for the Cowdenbeath seat in the Scottish Parliament was held following the death of Labour MSP Helen Eadie in November, just days after it emerged she was being treated for cancer.

Cowdenbeath in Fife, to the north of Edinburgh, is part of Gordon Brown’s seat at Westminster. The former Prime Minister remains a very popular figure in this part of Scotland, and he repeatedly took to the streets with his wife Sarah during the campaign.

Fife Council leader Alex Rowley, a former election agent for Mr Brown, was defending a Labour majority of just over 1,200. The seat was one of only 15 that Labour held in the Scottish Parliament election of 2011 when the SNP stormed to power with a landslide victory.

But Labour won yesterday’s battle with a majority of 5,488 and a huge 55.8 per cent share of the vote, up 9.3 percentage points since 2011.

The SNP trailed in second place with just 28.4 per cent, which was down 13.2 points. The Tories increased their share of the vote to 9.4 per cent, with UKIP in a distant fourth place on just 3 per cent.

But the most humiliating result was for the LibDems, whose popularity in Scotland has plummeted after joining the Conservatives in coalition at Westminster. They received just 425 votes, or 2.1 per cent of the total – and lost their deposit.

Turnout in the contest was only 34.81 per cent, and was as low as 11 per cent in one part of the constituency.

Defeat: The result signalled a major swing away from Alex Salmond's Scottish National Party

Alex Rowley said: “I'm delighted and humbled that the people of Cowdenbeath have put their faith in me to be their next MSP.

"We fought this campaign on the issues and concerns of hard working Fifers. Jobs, skills, training and opportunities for our young will be my priority and must be for the Scottish Government.”

Scottish Labour Leader Johann Lamont MSP added: “For Scottish Labour, we are encouraged that the people of Scotland are responding our positive message of reality and change and we are determined to build on this emphatic result as we enter a crucial period in our country's future."

Labour’s victory comes after the party gained the neighbouring Dunfermline seat with a majority of 2,783 over the SNP in October, which was the first time a seat had changed hands in a Scottish Parliament by-election for 13 years.

That victory came despite a widespread feeling that Labour had a much weaker candidate than the SNP, and ran a dismal campaign.

This time around, Mr Rowley proved an effective operator and was boosted by high-profile appearances from Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, as well as Mr Brown and his wife Sarah.

Charity worker Natalie McGarry, a rising star in the SNP, was the main challenger to Mr Rowley.

A regular television pundit, she is very well liked in the party and beyond, and is expected to be an elected member at some point in the future.

SNP business convener Derek Mackay said: “The SNP fought a strong campaign with an excellent candidate in Natalie McGarry, and we made the issues of the by-election the issues that matter to the people - the council tax freeze, free school meals and extending childcare.

"The share of the vote we achieved was the same as our performance in 2007 - when we won a national election across Scotland for the very first time - and therefore is an extremely creditable performance.

“This was the only seat in Fife we didn't win at the high water mark of 2011, it has remained a Labour seat in the by-election, and we wish Alex Rowley well in representing the people of Cowdenbeath constituency.

"However, the swing Labour achieved in Cowdenbeath is only around half the swings the SNP achieved in by-elections when Labour were in government, such as in Hamilton South and Glasgow East, which indicates the underlying strength of the SNP after nearly seven years in office.”
