It is one of the country's most recognizable sights and a building synonymous with American democracy.

Now a stunning new timelapse video has put a new twist on the famous view of Washington's Capitol dome - showing the landmark as it is dressed from top to bottom in scaffolding for its first renovation in more than 50 years.

The hugely complicated project involves removing several floral displays and pillars to be taken away for repair, while the 290ft high dome will be made watertight and 1,300 cracks in its cast iron shell repaired.

The new video - filmed over the course of several weeks - shows the structure's exterior as scaffolding is slowly pieced together at its base.

Mostly undertaken at night, the scaffolding work continues to build up around the building until it reaches the Statue of Freedom at its peak.

The footage is made all the more spectacular by the 720 LED construction lights installed for contractors to continue working on the job throughout the night.

Building work is expected to continue for two years, with much of it carried out on nights and weekends to minimize disruptions to Congress and sightseeing tours.

It is hoped the $60million project will preserve the building for future generations, as well as water proofing it following damage caused by roosting birds.

The cornerstone of the building was laid in 1793 by George Washington himself and was then worked on by doctor and part-time architect William Thornton who placed a shallow dome between the North Senate wing and the South House wing.

Construction then crawled along under the watchful eye of several different architects before much of their work was undone by British soldiers in 1814 who set fire to both the Capitol building and the White House.

Fortunately a rain storm stopped the building from being completely destroyed and construction was eventually 'finished' in 1826.

Building work continued to enlarge the Capitol from 1850 and it was architect Thomas U. Walter who designed the cast iron dome to sit between new enlarged chambers, with work finishing in 1868.
