Pressure: Chief executive Marc Bolland revealed that like-for-like sales in general merchandise have now fallen every quarter for two years

Shareholders told Marks & Spencer bosses yesterday that some stores are like a throwback to the classic BBC sitcom Are You Being Served?

One investor was applauded when she claimed shops reminded her of Grace Brothers – the fictitious old-fashioned department store.

The chaotic layout of some floors and an absence of staff to help customers also came in for stinging criticism as stakeholders received further gloom about sales in the company’s vital clothing sector.

At the chain’s annual meeting at Wembley Stadium, chief executive Marc Bolland revealed that like-for-like sales in general merchandise – which includes fashionwear – have now fallen every quarter for two years.

Sales fell by 1.6 per cent in the 13 weeks to the end of June compared to the same period last year.

Mr Bolland is now under huge pressure to win back customers who have switched to rivals such as Zara and Primark.

Shareholder Yasmin Hemani said she feared M&S could end up like failed retailers Jessops and HMV before comparing stores to Are You Being Served?, which ran from 1972 to 1985 and featured Frank Thornton as officious floorwalker Captain Peacock.

Mrs Hemani, 68, from St Albans, said: ‘The clothing department is all over the place, it is just chaotic. On top of that there is a conspicuous absence of staff.’

Many City analysts believe Mr Bolland is
fighting for his job.

He told shareholders that executives understood 
the importance in reviving women’s fashion.

‘We don’t want to disguise that we 
are not happy,’ he said.

‘This is unsatisfactory, but we have a very 
good and clear plan about how to address it.

'Trading figures showed that total 
sales in the last quarter were up 3.3 per cent – helped by a rise by 4.5
per cent in food sales and a 29 per cent boost online.

But Sir David Sieff, the great 
grandson of M&S founder Michael Marks, warned that middle England’s 
favourite retailer has ‘lost its way’.

Speaking after the meeting yesterday, he added: ‘We forgot about the customer. 

‘I don’t think we moved quickly enough with the times.’

In
an embarrassing blow to the current board, Sir David, who was a 
director between 1972 and 1997, espoused the success of rival Next.

But he said there are positive signs, adding: ‘The company has started to listen and things are looking encouraging.’
