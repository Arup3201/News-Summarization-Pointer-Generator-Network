New York City might soon get a new type of subway car that allows more circulation in trains.

Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials are envisioning a subway car of the future that will end the era of the captive car.

A 142-page document released this month outlines the needs for the next 20 years, in which the authority noted the benefits of articulated trains.

The trains are similar to accordion-style buses that have no doors between cars, allowing unrestricted flow throughout the length of the subway.

New subway cars: The idea is to have articulated trains similar to accordion-style buses that have no doors between cars, allowing unrestricted flow, like this train in Berlin, Germany

This is a similar model adopted in cities like Berlin, Paris and Toronto.

According
to the authority, the move will ‘both maximize carrying capacity’ and 
allow passengers to ‘move to less-crowded areas of the train, balancing 
loading and unloading times at all doors’.

It will also provide refuge from mariachi bands, other performers and preachers of all types, commonly seen roaming throughout the New York subway system, if people so choose to escape.

The cost difference between the current model and the proposed models has not been made clear.

Adam
Lisberg, the authority’s chief spokesman, said that increased capacity 
could improve ‘dwell time’, which is the period during which a train is 
stopped in a station, often because of overcrowding - and allow more 
trains to run, according to the New York Times.

He cautioned, though, that with a 109-year-old system, any major change required extensive review.

‘If you make a bad call on changing equipment in a new subway car order,’ he said, ‘the consequences can be pretty serious.’

Freedom: The new cars would allow passengers to move throughout the train. Here, a break dancer performs in a subway car in New York City

In 1924, the Brooklyn-Manhattan Transit Corporation introduced plans for the ‘Triplex’, with a hinged, multi-sectioned body.

It operated on the B, D, N, Q and R lines for 40 years, representing ‘the height of transit modernity’ at a moment when elevated lines often still featured wooden cars, according to the New York Transit Museum.

Today, many of the city’s subway cars are well past their prime, most strikingly those on the C line, known by their model number, R32, and for the tin-can siding that will continue rolling beneath Eighth Avenue for at least a few more years, said the New York Times.

Behind the rest: Richard Barone, Director of Transportation Programs at the Regional Plan Association, says the current trains ¿don¿t function right now to allow people to circulate'

Transit planners have urged the authority to consider articulated trains for future fleet upgrades.

‘We’re one of the largest systems in the world that doesn’t do it,’ said Richard Barone, the director of transportation programs at the Regional Plan Association.

‘Our trains don’t function right now to allow people to circulate.’

Andrew Albert, a member of the transportation authority’s board, recalled that separated cars had served another purpose for the city in a different age.

‘Remember the time when we were in the high-crime era and gangs were roaming through the trains?’ he said. ‘Everybody loved the locked end doors.’ 

The report from the transport authority does not state when the project would come into effect and start rolling on the tracks under New York City.
