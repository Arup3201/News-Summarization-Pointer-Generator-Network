The Mayor of London Boris Johnson was seen filling up on petrol in his banged-up old Toyota people carrier in East London earlier today.

The 49-year-old was pictured filling the dark green car, which boasts an 'I Love Scotland' sticker on the back and a couple of sizeable dents in the boot.

A member of the public asked if the car was his and he replied: 'Yes it is. Would you like to buy it?'

Mr Johnson has repeatedly voiced his objection to Scottish independence.

In November he told the Daily Telegraph: 'I have a feeling it was stuck there by some fellows from Strathclyde police when they came down to help with the Notting Hill carnival, and I keep it there because it reflects my general feelings.

'After three centuries of union, England and Scotland are not just woven together by sentiment, but by a cat’s cradle of intricate legal and political ties. Fibre by fibre that would have to be sliced apart, and the result will be agony and endless recrimination.'

Despite hand-wringing over Scottish independence, Mr Johnson has much to smile about at the moment.

The Budget pension pot windfall for millions of older people has led to a dramatic ‘grey power’ surge in Tory popularity, reviving David Cameron’s hopes of winning a second term in power.

It has seen the Conservatives slash Labour’s poll lead from 11 points less than a year ago to one.

The findings come from the first full-scale opinion survey since Wednesday’s Budget, which leaves the outcome of the 2015 General Election on a knife edge.

A Survation poll for The Mail on Sunday shows Labour on 35 (up one point on their January rating), the Tories on 34 (up four), UKIP on 15 (down three)and the Lib Dems on nine (down three).

Election expert John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, said last night that if the poll findings were repeated in a General Election tomorrow, it would be ‘too close to call’ as to whether Labour would be able to form a majority Government.
