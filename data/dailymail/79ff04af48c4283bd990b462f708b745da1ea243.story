Real Madrid unveiled their new goalkeeper Keylor Navas on Tuesday after he signed a six-year contract with the Spanish club.

The 27-year-old put in some heroic displays this summer as Costa Rica reached the quarter-finals of the World Cup for the first time.

At his presentation, Navas says he sees an opportunity to 'learn from the best,' with Iker Casillas and Diego Lopez already apart of coach Carlo Ancelotti's first-team squad.

Navas insisted that he isn't worried about vying with Casillas and Lopez for game time as the pair have been 'references for my career and I can learn a lot from both of them.'

Madrid announced the deal on Sunday after reaching an agreement with fellow Spanish club Levante reportedly worth £10million.
