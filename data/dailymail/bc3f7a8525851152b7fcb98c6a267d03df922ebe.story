More than 1,000 people protested outside the U.S. embassy in London last night, with some holding 'jail racist cops' placards, following the decision not to prosecute the American officer who shot dead black teenager Michael Brown.

The demonstration, outside the embassy in Grosvenor Square, central London, saw people condemn the grand jury decision not to indict Darren Wilson for shooting unarmed Mr Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.

While rioting, fighting and chaos has broken out in several U.S. states following the jury's decision on Monday night, the protest in London passed off peacefully and without trouble.

Police confirmed no arrests were made, despite the crowd being so large that it spilled out of a designated area in Grosvenor Square and lined up against the fence of the embassy.

Many of the protesters held placards which read 'jail racist cops' and 'black lives matter', while others carried candles.

A minute's silence was observed to remember people killed by the police around the world, which was followed by a loud chant of 'killer police off our streets'.

After listening to a number of speeches, the group marched down nearby Oxford Street and traffic was later stopped as protesters made their way towards Piccadilly Circus.

Police said the demonstration 'became an impromptu march', with people dispersing at around 11.30pm.

'Officers from the Police Liaison Team engaged with demonstrators and an appropriate policing operation was conducted,' Scotland Yard said.

Carole Duggan, aunt of Mark Duggan, and Marcia Rigg, of the Sean Rigg Justice and Change campaign, both spoke at the gathering outside the embassy.

Mark Duggan, a young black man, was shot dead by a police officer in London in August 2011 sparking riots across the city, while Sean Rigg died at Brixton police station in 2008. Marcia Rigg is Sean Rigg's sister.

Ms Duggan told the crowd: 'We need to send a message to Mike Brown's family.

'We feel the pain, we know the pain, of losing somebody at the hands of the police.

'That is why we stand in solidarity with the community of Ferguson. I feel they are very strong and brave people.'

She went on: 'They've come to a point in Ferguson where there is no turning back.

'They have to carry on fighting. They have to see this through.

'We have to stand behind them because you know what happens there will eventually happen here.'

Ferguson was engulfed in serious civil unrest following the grand jury's decision not to charge police officer Mr Wilson on Monday night.

The white officer shot the 18-year-old multiple times on August 9, sparking widespread protests and disruption across the state.  

Ms Rigg said: 'Burning and looting - we don't condone these acts - but I for one and I'm sure people around the world understand the frustration and anger that the people are feeling when our loved ones are murdered on the streets.

'What else are we supposed to do?'

All we keep getting are lying and corrupt officers murdering our loved ones.'

The London protest was organised by campaign groups Stand Up To Racism and the London Black Revolutionaries.
