A black Connecticut police officer who was recently acquitted in a brutality case has been targeted in a threatening, racist memo apparently sent by a fellow cop. 

The note, written on official letterhead and starting with the words 'WHITE POWER', was found in internal mailboxes in Bridgeport's police department day room, which is only accessible by officers.

'Officer Clive Higgins doesn't belong here in this Police Department,' reads the note, which was shared by NBC Connecticut. 'These Black Officers belong in the toilet.'

Higgins, 49, was acquitted last month in a 2011 police brutality case. Footage had emerged showing him and two other officers kicking a suspected drug dealer after the man had been tasered.

Terrifying: Police officers in Bridgeport, Connecticut received this memo, written on official letterhead, in their internal mailboxes. The note targets a black officer acquitted last month in a police brutality case

Acquitted: Officer Clive Higgins, pictured outside court with his wife last August, was the target of the racist memo. He was acquitted last year of police brutality

The other two officers, Elson Morales and Joseph Lawlor, both pleaded guilty while Higgins, who was seen arriving after the other two officers had already subdued the suspect, pleaded not guilty.

Morales and Lawlor both agreed to resign from the police department after pleading guilty, while Higgins remains at the force. 

'He doesn't belong here,' the memo continues. 'He didn't even support his fellow Officers in Court. Where were you Higgins ?? You better watch your back.. We know where you live.

'Remember you have no duty weapon to defend yourself.'

The startling letter also claims that the chief and assistant chief want Higgins out of the department.

Bridgeport police Detective Harold Dimbo told NBC Connecticut that he believes a member of the department wrote the memo because of where it was found.

In a statement on Tuesday, Dimbo, who is also vice president of the Bridgeport Guardians, a minority officers' organization, said the letter is 'creating a hostile work environment'. 

Violent: In the case, two other officers, Elson Morales and Joseph Lawlor (both pictured), pleaded guilty to violating a suspect's civil rights after tasering him into submission and then kicking him on the ground

Backup: Another officer, Clive Higgins, who was targeted in the racist memo, then arrives on the scene

Threats: In the video, Higgins was seen kicking the man on the ground but he was acquitted in the case. The disgusting racist note threatens him for failing to show up in court for the other officers

'This type of behavior affects the minorities and spreads racism and hatred throughout the Bridgeport Police Department as well as the community,' the statement said.

'As the Vice-President of the Bridgeport Guardians, I would like to work with the administration and the community to resolve and eliminate this behavior and fire those that stand behind it.'

The city's communications director, Brett Broesder, said officials are prepared to take action against the person responsible for the note.

'Bottom line is that any discussion of discrimination within any part of the city is something we have a zero-tolerance policy on,' he said.

In the police brutality case, the city agreed to pay $198,000 to the victim, Orlando Lopez-Soto,  the Connecticut Post reported. He is now serving five years in prison after pleading guilty to drug and gun charges in 2012.

He had claimed that his civil rights had been violated because he was unable to defend himself after being tasered and the video, which emerged two years later, helped prove his case, his lawyer said. 

Guilty: Officer Elson Morales, pictured center with his wife and attorney last June, pleaded guilty in the case

Accused: Another officer, Joseph Lawlor, pictured with his girlfriend outside the court last June, also pleaded guilty. Both officers agreed to leave the police force and now face up to a year in prison

During Higgins' trial, an FBI agent had testified that the police officer had been concerned that the suspect was armed so kicked him to stop him getting up.

Higgins said the police had previously received information that the man was 'terrorizing' people in the park with a gun, the Connecticut Post reported. 

'I'm a Christian man,' he said after his acquittal. 'I should never have had to go through this nonsense. I was hired to protect the citizens of Bridgeport and that's all I ever tried to do.'

Higgins, an officer in Bridgeport since 2002 and a Sunday school teacher, had faced up to 10 years behind bars if he had been convicted. 

The other two officers face up to a year in prison.
