A woman too heavy to leave her parents’ basement for over two years has received a new lease of life after radical weight loss surgery.

Olivia, 46, from Cicero, Illinois, weighed around 43st, and had not left the house since a suicide attempt in 2012, due to a lack of mobility and weight-related depression.

In a last-ditch effort to turn her life around, Olivia moved to Houston to seek pioneering surgery from a specialist in the super morbidly obese.

Olivia's near 600lb frame meant she had been reliant on oxygen for 11 years and was confined to her parents basement

Olivia moved across the country to live with her brother (pictured here with her brother's wife) in Houston in the hope of getting the surgery she needed

As well as causing extreme medical problems, Olivia's weight had made her depressed, causing her to attempt to take her own life in 2012

There, Olivia was finally able to get the risky 
bariatric surgery she needed to shed the weight that had effectively 
been keeping her prisoner.

Previously totally dependent on her family for even her most basic needs, Olivia had dreamed of living on her own and re-joining society.

However her mobility was severely restricted by lymphodema: one of Olivia's legs had ballooned, due to blockage in her lymph system, which made it very painful to move around at all.

Pre-surgery, Olivia confessed: ‘My body is my prison. I have been hiding from the world just waiting to die. It scares me to think that one day I might not wake up because of my weight.

‘Sometime it feels like I'm dead, that I'm not alive. My weight is killing me.

‘Just moving around is hard with this weight hanging over my knees. That’s why I don’t go out, I don’t leave the house.

‘I want to get up and just leave but I can’t. I haven’t been out in society in two years.

‘If I am feeling alone, sad, depressed, food is what makes me happy because that is what comforts me.

‘I'm eating and eating and I know that I’m full and I can feel that I'm full, but I’m still eating.

‘If I wasn’t this size I would probably be someone right now. I want my house, my car, my life; I want all of that back.

Olivia suffered numerous health problems brought on by her weight and was dependent on breathing equipment to get enough oxygen.

‘For the last seven years I have been in and out of the hospital constantly for my illnesses and depression.

‘I have been on oxygen now for 11 years; I sleep with it, I wake up with it, I survive with it.

Olivia depended on her twin sister Olga and mother Minerva for food, to take her to the doctor and help her with her oxygen supplies.

After her surgery, Olivia spent three months in hospital recovering and having her food intake closely monitored

‘I was afraid for her to be by herself,’ Minerva says, ‘she wants to be independent but she is not in a good place right now. ‘

Olivia’s reliance on her loved ones in itself took a toll on her emotionally.

‘I fear being a burden on my family. They do everything for me.’

Bullied for her size growing up, Olivia dropped out of high school in her senior year because she couldn’t face the constant ridicule.

However, this signalled the start of her descent into morbid obesity.

‘I started putting on weight in elementary school. It was due to bullying and molestation.

'I was molested when I was eight and I kept it secret until I was 40.

'As time went on I started putting on a lot of weight. By high school I would say I probably weigh about 250lbs. I just didn’t care anymore. Putting on the weight is how I avoided people.’

Olivia had gastric band surgery seven years ago but failed to lose weight.

‘I know they say you have to put in effort but I just gave up on myself.

Though still with a way to go on her weight loss journey, Olivia is looking forward to her future and being more independent

‘On a typical day I really don’t do anything. It feels like these walls are closing in on me.

‘Two years ago I gave up; being here, being sick. I tried to commit suicide. I have never felt so low.

In 2013, Olivia decided to move to Houston, leaving her twin sister behind for the first time ever, to live with her brother in the hope of receiving bariatric surgery from Dr Nowzaradan, who specialises in weight loss surgery on the super morbidly obese.

After removing the existing band in Olivia's stomach, Dr Nowzaradan performed a sleeve gastrectomy. Olivia was left with a small, banana-shaped cavity that only allows her to eat tiny amounts at a time.

Following the operation Olivia spent three months in hospital, dropping to 360lb (25st 7lb). Once home, Olivia's loss slowed as she struggled to adjust to managing her diet on her own.

However, seven months after the surgery, her weight finally dropped below 300lb, allowing her to undergo further surgery to remove the excess skin and lymphodema.

Requiring a four foot incision and over 500 blood vessels to be cut, a mass of excess tissue and skin  weighing 40lb was removed.

Although Olivia's journey from 43st 8lbs to 18st has been at times traumatic, she is now looking forward to the future for the first time in years.

'I think another 100lb and I will probably be where i want to be,' she says.

'I'm excited. the last time I felt this free was probably in grammar school.'

Olivia is now able to walk with the aid of a stick and is no longer dependent on oxygen cannisters.

‘I do things I couldn’t do before: I couldn’t pull up my socks, I couldn’t touch my toes. I just want to get on with things. Live my life.

'This journey was not easy, with every pain every stitch, every tear that I cried. But I didn’t give up

'I have been reborn and brought back to life.’
