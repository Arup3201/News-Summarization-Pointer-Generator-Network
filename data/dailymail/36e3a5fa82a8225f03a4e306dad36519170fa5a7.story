Daniel Ricciardo believes finishing ahead of Sebastian Vettel in this year's Formula One world championship would prove to be a real feather in his cap.

Back-to-back third-place finishes in the last two grands prix behind dominant Mercedes pair Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg have elevated Red Bull's Ricciardo into fourth place in the drivers' standings.

Centre of attention: Daniel Ricciardo claims finishing above Sebastian Vettel would boost his confidence

Reigning four-times champion Vettel, meanwhile, has suffered gremlins this year and is now nine points adrift of Ricciardo, promoted from Toro Rosso at the end of last season as replacement for Mark Webber.

Despite the regulation changes over the winter, not many would have put good money on the 24-year-old Australian having the edge over Vettel so far, but that is how the season is panning out.

Naturally, Ricciardo is aware of the kudos he would gain should he still be ahead of Vettel come the conclusion to the season in Abu Dhabi.

'It 
wouldn't be a bad thing. It would give me a lot of confidence,' said 
Ricciardo, speaking ahead of this weekend's Canadian Grand Prix that was
 won by Vettel 12 months ago.

'In
 saying that, I've probably already done enough to show the guys I can 
do it, and when I say 'can do it', not specifically beat Seb, but to 
race at the front, be in a top team, and deserve to be here.

'Whatever happens in the championship, the final result, unless we win then it's probably not going to matter.

'They
 (the team) will probably look at specific races in the year and say 'in
 this one he did well', or 'in this he did quite well'. It would be a 
nice pat on the back I guess.'

Bearing in mind Vettel has never finished behind a team-mate since he entered F1 in 2007, Ricciardo insists there is no magic to what he has achieved so far, just unwavering confidence in himself.

'It's important for me to try to learn from him (Vettel), and I'd be silly not to because he's obviously the best in the world, so I can't be stubborn about that," added Ricciardo.

'At the same time I work well when I focus on myself. If I get distracted too much with what Seb is doing then it takes my mind off what I need to be doing.

Surprise: Ricciardo has exceeded expectations by leading Vettel in the championship

'I have a lot of belief in my ability, and I know if I do everything I can to my best then the results will come.

'At the moment 95 per cent is directed towards myself, and then on the side, if I can learn a bit from Seb, then I do.

It's trying to do what I know first and then worry about the rest later.'
