David Cameron’s Fiat 500 which he bought as a surprise birthday present for his wife is up for sale and expected to fetch £10,000 at auction.

The Prime Minister may have moved on to bigger and better cars than the small, humble Italian car, preferring to travel in the comfort of a chauffeur-driven Jaguar XJ, but back in 1998 the iconic Fiat was the present of choice for his wife Samantha Cameron.

The couple kept the car for ten years, clocking just 1,000 miles around the Cotswolds.

Memento for sale: This Fiat 500, which David Cameron owned for ten years, will go under the hammer in November and expected to fetch between £8,000 and £12,000

This original right-hand drive Fiat 500 L was first registered on 20th August 1971 in Warwickshire and has covered what is believed to be a genuine 13,000 miles from new.

It will be sold by Silverstones Auctions on November 17 at the Footman James Classic Motor Show at the NEC and is expected to fetch between £8,000 and £12,000 when it goes under the hammer.

Nick Whale, managing director of the auction house said: ‘No matter what your political persuasion, this is one cool car and we are delighted to be able to offer it for auction at our sale in November as part of the Footman James Classic Motor Show weekend.

‘After all, it’s not everyday that you get the chance to bid for a car that was once owned by a global figure.’

Will Smith, a specialist at the auction house, said: ‘It was bought as a birthday present and it really was a thoughtful gift. 

‘The Fiat 500 is a trendle little car and would have been the perfect car for the Camerons to drive to the shops in.

‘It is in pristine condition and has been restored beautifully. Not only is it ideal as a weekend car but it is also perfect as a city run-around.’

Fiat built the 500 between 1957 and 1975 and it became one the most iconic and unmistakable cars of the 20th century.

With a tiny 479 cc two-cylinder, air-cooled engine, the Fiat 500 characterised working class motoring in the past. 

The auction comes after Mr Cameron recounted a ‘terrible’ experience of having his Skoda stolen in a burglary.

He recalled how raiders once burgled his home then escaped in his car, telling Sky: ‘I’ve been burgled a couple of times when I lived in London, in North Kensington. There was one occasion when I left the keys in my car and they loaded up my Skoda and drove off. It is a horrible feeling when your house has been invaded.’
