Michael Beaumont claimed his son Kadan had been fatally injured by the family dog but he was found guilty of murder today

A father who claimed the family dog killed his 11-month-old son has been found guilty of murder today.

Michael Beaumont, 29, claimed Kadan had been knocked over by his Staffordshire Bull Terrier and even sent pictures of his son's injuries to his girlfriend and the child's mother, Helen Barnes.

But prosecutors at Sheffield Crown Court said this was a story he made up to disguise the horrific injuries he had inflicted.

Part-time gardener Beaumont, from 
Hoyland, near Barnsley, claimed the dog, called Mia, had 'flipped over' 
Kadan before banging his head on some garden steps.

In the message to 28-year-old Barnes, he wrote: 'Look at my head mummy. Naughty Mia knocked me down the steps in the garden.

'I cut my neck as well. Don't worry, daddy chased her round the garden and slapped her.'

The jury was told how emergency services 
were called to the family home on September 28, 2011, following reports 
that the baby had been unwell after being knocked over by the dog the 
day before.

Kadan was taken to Barnsley District General Hospital and later transferred to Sheffield Children’s Hospital where he died.

Pathologists later found 34 different injuries on Kadan’s body and said he died as a result of a heavy impact to his head.

Kadan’s mother, teaching assistant Helen Barnes, 28, was found guilty of neglect and wept in the dock when the verdict was announced.

A neighbour who saw Kadan after the alleged dog incident said he 'looked as though he had been beaten up by Mike Tyson' but no medical attention was sought until an ambulance was called the next day.

Doctors found he had two recent fractures of the skull, bleeding in his eyes and on the surface of the brain as well as multiple bruises to his head and face.

Beaumont and Barnes will be sentenced tomorrow at Sheffield Crown Court by Mr Justice Globe.

Detective
 Chief Inspector Sean Middleton, who led the investigation, said: 'This 
is a shocking case of violence from a parent, which sadly resulted in 
the death of an innocent young child.

Beaumont, 28, (pictured outside court) sent a picture of Kadan's injuries to the baby's mother Helen Barnes (right). She has been found guilty of neglect and both will be sentenced tomorrow

'By blaming the family dog, Beaumont attempted to cover his horrific actions, but the evidence surrounding the cause of Kadan’s death, provided by expert pathologists, was overwhelming.

'Beaumont claimed that Kadan had been knocked over by the dog the day before, however, experts concluded that Kadan had died from head injuries that were likely to have been sustained only an hour before emergency services were called.

'This has been a particularly distressing case for all concerned and hopefully the end of this trial will bring some closure to the rest of Kadan’s family.

'I would like to thank the community of Hoyland for their help and support during this investigation.'
