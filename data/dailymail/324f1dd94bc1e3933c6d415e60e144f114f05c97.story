She, her boyfriend and several members of his entourage were involved in a massive bar brawl just hours before.

But Chris Brown's girlfriend Karrueche Tran didn't appear to have a care in the world as she left her hotel with the singer's camp this afternoon.

In fact the 24-year-old model was laughing and smiling as she hotfooted it to an awaiting car with a handful of Brown's assistants.

Like nothing had even happened: Chris Brown's girlfriend Karrueche Tran didn't appear to have a care in the world as she left her hotel with the singer's camp this afternoon

However, others in the group didn't appear to be sharing Tran's upbeat attitude, with two friends hardly unable to raise a smile.

Tran, who was present when the brawl went down in Manhattan club WIP last night, was casual in a pair of light grey leggings and a white printed T-shirt.

She toted a leopard print handbag and a pair of bright pink Nike Air Jordans on her feet.

Meanwhile Chris is currently dealing with aftermath of the brawl he was involved in with fellow entertainer Drake last night.

Brown's lawyer Mark Geragos happened to be in the Big Apple at the time of the incident and today is speaking with detectives from the New York Police Department, according to Radaronline.

Chris had called his lawyer immediately after the attack.

'Contrary to reports Chris didn't flee from the scene, it was a very fluid situation and Chris just wanted to make sure that his girlfriend, Karreuche Tran, was safe,' a source told the website.

'Luckily for Chris, his attorney happened to already be in New York City and he has been talking with detectives from the NYPD and with management at the nightclub.

Clash: Chris posted a picture of his cut chin to his ten million followers after an alleged brawl with rapper Drake

The nightclub brawl took place in the early hours of this morning.

Following the incident Brown posted a picture of a nasty gash on his chin - which he apparently sustained from the fallout with Drake and his entourage.

Brown
 allegedly flew into a rage after Drake taunted him by returning a 
bottle of champagne he'd sent over as 'peace offering' with a note 
reading:  'I'm f****** the love of your life, deal with it'.

Drakes crude response was clearly a reference to Brown's ex-girlfriend Rihanna.

According to website Global Grind Chris reportedly flew into a rage and confronted Drake.

Drake allegedly threw a punch but before the singer could retaliate, another man hit Brown in the face with a bottle.

A source told the New York Post: 'They were on opposite sides of the room, Drake went over to the middle of the club to talk to someone, then words were exchanged with Chris and his entourage.

The source said someone from Drake's entourage, possibly the singer himself, threw a bottle.

'Once the bottle was thrown, all hell broke loose and there were more bottles thrown.'

TMZ is also reporting that the fight kicked off after Drake stuck his middle finger up to one of Brown's bodyguards.

He also shouted 'I'm about to go whoop that a**!'

What then began was hand gestures flying back and forth between the parties.

After feeling 'disrespected', the 
rapper reportedly recruited his friends Meek Mill, Juelz Santana, and Trav B for 
backup, and proceeded to yell at Brown from across the club shouting: 
'You be on that ho s*** on Twitter n***a,' referencing to their famous 
Twitter war of words.

This then prompted Chris entourage to get angry and the brawl promptly erupting.

The fight allegedly kicked off as the last song was playing, just before 4 a.m.

Police were 
already at the scene because it was closing time and that they 'were on 
it in seconds and began getting everyone out of the club.'

Pictures of the aftermath show the club floor strewn with broken glass.

Brown was pulled out of the situation by his own security and helped out of the club while Drake was pulled to the back of the club, the source said. '[Drake] was one of the last out of W.I.P.'

Bloody: An Australian tourist, Hollie C, 24, and Brown's bodyguard Big Pat were among the five people injured according to the NYPD

The New York Police department 
confirmed to the Global Grind that the two singers' crews got into a 
fight at
Manhattan nightclub - 5 people were injured in the melee including 
Chris' bodyguard who suffered a serious cut to the head, two other men 
and two women suffered minor cuts. At least three were hospitalised.

Police
 were looking at surveillance footage and talking to patrons who 
witnessed the melee. No arrests have been made and no complaints filed.

Drake
 has today denied he was involved in 'any kind last night at W.i.P.' His
 spokeswoman said in a statement: 'He was on his way out of the club 
when the altercation began.

The fight will further fuel rumours regarding the closeness of Rihanna to her ex Brown.

Earlier this week the
 two pop superstars partied at the same club at the same time for the 
second time in as many days, leaving within minutes of each other.

TMZ reported the pair 
were in the club together for around 30 minutes and Brown spent some 
time with the Rude Girl singer at her table.

Still close: Rihanna leaves New York club Avenue minutes after her ex-boyfriend Chris Brown

Sitting
 in different booths, the couple still 'kept a close eye on each other' -
 and Brown sent her over two bottles of Ace of Spades Champagne.

A video surfaced earlier this week of the pair leaving the club minutes apart.

The lovelorn pair have been linked 
together several times already this year, after it emerged that they had
 recorded songs with each.

And of late wherever Rihanna is, 
Brown isn't far behind, as they party at birthday celebrations and 
nightclubs in West Hollywood.

The sighting comes after another sign
 that Rihanna is paving the way for a reconciliation with singer Chris ,
 as the raunchy singer reportedly invited the singer to attend a 
basketball game party on Saturday with her family.

The singer and Brown joined her family - including grandfather Lionel Braithwaite on Saturday at an intimate gathering at Jay-Z's New York club 40/40 to watch the Miami Heat beat the Boston Celtics.

A source told The New York Post: 'Rihanna arrives first in a yellow cab, with her family and friends, and was escorted to a private room.

'Brown arrived a little later and joined her and her family.'

The pair have been spotted together often in recent weeks 

Full footage will be released on WeMobbinDVD'
