Two tourists are being questioned by police after a man's body was found washed up on a popular holiday beach.

Police were called to Great Western Beach, in Newquay, Cornwall, early yesterday morning after visitors found a young man's body by the sea.

The unidentified man was believed to be in his early 20s. A post mortem examination is being carried out to determine whether the man drowned or if his body was pushed into the water.

A dog walker at the busy resort found the man's wet body close to the tide at 8.30am yesterday. Police say the man was involved in an 'incident' in the town before his death and are questioning the two individuals involved, but did not give details of the incident.

Discovery: The body was found by Bank Holiday visitors on Great Western Beach, Newquay, yesterday morning

A major investigation has been launched by Devon and Cornwall beach at the resort, which is packed for the Jubilee weekend.

The man's death is the latest in a series of tragedies near Newquay's high cliffs, close to the bars and clubs which are popular among visiting students.

Two students died and one was paralysed in 2009 after they fell from cliffs at the nearby Tolcarne beach.

The resort is a popular destination for students celebrating the end of their school years or exams, with many campsites that host large numbers of partygoers.

Danger: A number of teenagers have fallen to their deaths from the high cliffs of Newquay's beaches

A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall police said two people have been interviewed about the events leading up to the latest fatality.

A spokesman said: 'At 08.29 am on Saturday police were called by a member of the public reporting a possible dead body on Great Western Beach in Newquay.

'Officers attended and located the body of a young man in his 20s that had been washed up from the sea, the body was clothed.

'Police cordoned the area to allow for an investigation of the scene and the enquiries are continuing.

"The family of the man have since been informed of his death, however how and when he died and how he got into the sea are not known at this time.

'A number of lines of enquiry are being followed. We have established that he was involved in an incident in the town earlier in the evening and are speaking to two individuals with regard to this incident.'

Hazardous: Tolcarne beach, where a 16-year-old boy died while on holiday after his GCSEs three years ago
