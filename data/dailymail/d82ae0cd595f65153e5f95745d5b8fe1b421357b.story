For centuries the Church has largely depicted the crucifixion of Christ with his arms outstretched horizontally on a cross.

But scientists believe that death by crucifixion may have been even crueller, and that a victim’s arms were probably nailed above their head.

An international team studying the Shroud of Turin, which appears to depict a man who was put to death by crucifixion, said that no matter who created it, the artefact suggests that the practice involved a victim who was suspended in a Y-shape.

Unshrouded? An international team of scientists studying the Shroud of Turin (pictured), which appears to depict a man who was put to death by crucifixion, said that whoever created it suggests that the practice involved a victim being suspended in a Y-shape. They came to this conclusion after studying lines of 'blood' down the arms, which can be seen in this image

The Shroud is a 14ft (4.3 metre) long piece of linen that appears to show the faint imprint of a man bearing wounds consistent with crucifixion.

Some people believe it shows the image of Jesus of Nazareth, while others think it is a medieval forgery of cloth wrapped around a body after crucifixion.

The Shroud is the most studied artefact in human history but its age remains in dispute.

Radiocarbon dating of the cloth carried out by the University of Oxford in 1998 found it was only 728 years old.

But a recent study claims that an earthquake in Jerusalem in 33AD that could have created the image and skewed dating results.

Professor Alberto Carpinteri, from the Politecnico di Torino, said: 'We believe it is possible that neutron emissions by earthquakes could have induced the image formation on the Shroud's linen fibres, through thermal neutron capture on nitrogen nuclei, and could also have caused a wrong radiocarbon dating,' The Telegraph reported.

The Shroud has attracted widespread interest ever since Secondo Pia took the first photograph of it in 1898 which showed details which could not be seen by the naked eye.

The Vatican has never said whether it believes the shroud to be authentic.

The Shroud of Turin is the most studied artefact in history and opinion is divided as to whether it was created in medieval times as a kind of hoax or whether it really shows the face of Jesus of Nazareth, as some believe.

Whatever the case, the linen cloth, which is imprinted with the faint image of a naked man, seems to show lines of blood that have streamed down his arms as well as other wounds.

Regardless of whether the Shroud is Biblical or medieval, Matteo Borrini at Liverpool John Moores University told New Scientist that ‘it’s a very interesting piece of art and human ingenuity’.

He set out to find whether the ‘bloodstains’ on the left arm matched up with the flow of blood from a crucified person.

To investigate, another researcher from 
the University of Pavia, Italy, assumed different crucifixion poses 
while donated blood trickled down his arm from a place where the shroud 
shows a nail was hammered through the hand.

The duo found that the ‘blood’ marks on 
the shroud correspond to a crucifixion – but only if a person was nailed
 onto a cross in a ‘Y’ position instead of a ‘T’ position, as depicted 
in most Christian art. 

The scientists set out to find whether the 'bloodstains' on the Turin Shroud flow of blood from a crucified person.  By safely simulating different positions of crucifixion they worked out that the man wrapped in the legendary cloth must have been crucified in a Y-shape position, pictured right

The majority of Christian art shows Jesus stretched into a T-shaped position on the cross, such as this famous painting by Andrea Mantegna, which is housed in Musee du Louvre, Paris

Some artists have chosen to represent Jesus on the cross with his hands nailed above his head, such Jacob Jordaens' Crucificon scene (pictured left)  which was painted in the 17th Century, with other artists choosing to show Christ's arms in a shallow V-shape, like Diego Velazquez's image painted at around the same time

Dr Borrini said: ‘This would have been a very painful position and one which would have created difficulty breathing.’

It is thought that someone crucified in a ‘Y’ position would have died from asphyxiation.

The imprint on the Shroud does not correspond with many traditional artistic images of crucifixion but Peter Paul Reubens - a 16th century Flemish painter - shows Jesus crucified in a Y-shape. His painting, 'Descent from the Cross' is pictured

He explained to a February meeting of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences in Seattle that similar positions were used in medieval torture, where victims were suspended from a beam from their wrists, which were tied with rope.

So if the Shroud is indeed a medieval forgery, it may be an interpretation of contemporary practice, rather than that of Biblical times.

The results of the experiment back up earlier work by a Massachusetts-based doctor called Gilbert Lavoie who suggested that the person depicted in the shroud was crucified in a Y-shape.

In his study, Dr Lavoie said: ‘The blood-flow is absolutely consistent with what you see on the Shroud.'

Danish doctor Niels Svensson, who has studied the Shroud, said: ‘The imprint on the Shroud does not correspond with many traditional artistic images of crucifixion.’

While the majority of Christian art shows Jesus stretched into a T-shaped position on the cross, some painters, including Peter Paul Rubens, depicted Christ with his arms above his head on the cross.

Dr Borrini believes that the person who made the shroud must have been a skilled forger (if it is not 'real') to show the correct blood spatter for a crucifixion – or they stumbled across it by chance.

‘It could be that the artist just decided to draw the rivulets of blood parallel to the arms for artistic reasons,’ he said.

In Roman times there was a common way to put people on the cross, Matteo Borrini told MailOnline.

‘The vertical stake was fixed to the soil in an area usually devoted to capital punishments, while the horizontal branch, called the patibulum, was carried on by the person who was to be crucified.’

‘Theoretically this was the rule, but Roman historian Josephus (Giuseppe Flavio) reported how in  the war against Gerusalem  in 70 AD,Roman soldiers enjoyed crucifying prisoners on trees in the most painful and strange positions.’

Dr Borrini explained that there are only short passages of writing from ancient authors about crucifixion, probably because the technique was a well-known way to sentence someone to death – ‘but it was also a very infamous way to die.’

Dr Frederick Zugibe conducted ‘extensive suspension studies’ that explained the higher the upper limbs are, more painful the ‘Y’ position is.

Dr Borrini said: ‘We can imagine that it became more difficult for the subject to breath, but this problem could be avoided or partially reduced allowing the prisoner to have a rest thanks to the sedile - a small step behind his pelvis - that could be used as a sort of chair.

‘We have some reports of cruciarii (victim of crucifixion) that stayed on the cross for some days and this could be related to the use of the sedile,’ he said.

The reason for the procedure was likely not merciful but designed to prolong the pain of the victim and their exposure to the sun, as well as their humiliation ‘partially starving him but also creating muscular pain to him due to the uncomfortable position of upper and lower limbs’.

If authorities wanted the victim’s death to be quicker, they might have positioned them in a high ‘Y’ position and broken their legs, which would have increased breathing difficulty and accelerated death, Dr Borrini explained.

Dr Zugibe said in his research that this approach was a way to create a fatal shock in the prisoner.

It is not known whether the Shroud is medieval or is older, but it could suggest that many artworks showing the death of Christ are inaccurate
