It was designed so that its owner could drive his Aston Martin up a ramp and straight into his own first-floor parking bay and turning circle.

Now this bizarre roundhouse - which comes complete with its own lake, 10-acre garden and private 18-metre pontoon on the Bealieu river in Hampshire - can be yours... for just £12million.

Bearing more than a passing resemblance to the lair of a James Bond villain, the property was the home of architect Seymour Harris who, after designing it, lived there for six years.

Fit for a Bond villain: Tukal comes complete with its own lake, pontoon and ramp to a first floor garage

Yours... for £12m: The roundhouse was built in the 1960s by architect Seymour Harris, who made his own home for six years

Influenced by Africa: The Tukal was named after a traditional Ethiopian hut, a country where Harris spent some of his time

When the roundhouse was unveiled in 1962, its appearance stunned surrounding neighbours who were used to a more conventional architecture. It was given the nickname of Hollywood on the Beaulieu.

Harris's widow Joan told the Guardian in 2009: 'I am afraid most of the neighbours thought it dreadful, since they were accustomed to a more prosaic style.

'I do seem to recall that it was called Hollywood on the Beaulieu river or some such.'

Harris named the property Tukal, after a traditional type of roundhouse in Ethiopia where he spent time in the 1950s.

It also boasts a cinema, swimming pool and a huge curved glass-walled space estate agent describe as a 'gallery/ballroom'.

Plush: The drawing room is a split-level sixties affair. It's highly unusual design might put off many, but estate agents insist the right buyer will fall in love with the property instantly

Secret features: In the library (above) there are hidden doors to three bedrooms behind the books

Luxury living: The Tukal also has six bedroom suites, a tennis court and staff flat

While estate agents agree the house is highly unconventional and could put off many, they believe it will be irresistible to the right buyer.

James Crawford, of Knight Harris estate agents, told the Guardian. 'Somebody will come and see it, and buy it on the spot. It is a very unusual and highly individual property, an amazing house.'

The house - whose most recent owner was outdoor sports shop chain Snow+Rock founder Mike Browne - is freehold but the pontoon is on a 99-year lease at two guineas a yea.
