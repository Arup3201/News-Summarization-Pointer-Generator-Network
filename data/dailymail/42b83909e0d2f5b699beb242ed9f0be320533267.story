A baby boy with a flattened head is on the road to recovery thanks to a special helmet which encourages his skull to grow in a normal shape.

Six month old Freddie Summersgill was diagnosed with flat head syndrome, a condition which causes his forehead to bulge out because the back of his skull has become flat.

His family managed to raise the £2,000 needed for the custom-built helmet and special pillow to treat the condition, so that Freddie's head would develop without an unusual shape.

After wearing the helmet for a month, the flattened bit of Freddie's head has already grown by 7mm and his family hope the progress  will continue.

Freddie's mother Becci Oram noticed her son's ears were lopsided and his forehead pushed out, so she took him to a specialist who diagnosed flat head syndrome. Here, she is pictured with her son now he has a special helmet which will help his head grown normally

Freddie's mother, Becci Oram, 24, from Billingham, County Durham, said first spotted the change in the shape of her son's head when he was two months old.

She was told it was due to tight muscles in his neck and was nothing to worry about.

However, it got progressively worse to the point where Freddie's ears were lopsided and his forehead pushed out, and Ms Oram decided further checks were necessary.

A trip to the specialist clinic when he was four and a half months old revealed he had flat head syndrome, which is medically known as plagiocephaly and brachycephaly.

This common condition causes the head to become either flattened on one side, causing it to look asymmetrical and distorted, or flattened at the back, which can cause the forehead to bulge out.

Sometimes the ears may not be the same height and the head may look like a parallelogram when seen from above.

The head can be flattened in the womb, and the condition is more common in babies born prematurely because they're squeezed through the birth canal when their skulls haven't fully developed.

But the most common cause is because babies now sleep on their backs every night – a position doctors advise to prevent cot death.

Babies sometimes develop a flattened head when they're a few months old, usually from sleeping on their back.

It's known as 'flat head syndrome' or 'moulding' and there are two types – plagiocephaly and brachycephaly

Plagiocephaly is the most common type and occurs when the head is flattened on one side, causing it to look asymmetrical and distorted. 

For example, the ears may be misaligned and when seen from above the head, looks like a parallelogram.

Brachycephaly is when the back of the head becomes flattened, causing the head to widen. To compensate, the front of the skull sometimes bulges out.

The head can be flattened in the womb, and the condition is more common in babies born prematurely because they're squeezed through the birth canal when their skulls haven't fully developed.

But the most common cause is because babies now sleep on their backs every night – a position doctors advise to prevent cot death.

When they lie on their backs, the full weight of their heads rests on the back of their skulls and the pressure of the mattress on their soft skull causes it to become flat.

The conditions is not thought to be medically dangerous, and it will often correct itself over time.

When they lie on their backs, the full weight of their heads rests on the back of their skulls and the pressure of the mattress on their soft skull causes it to become flat.

Although not thought to be medically dangerous, the flattened head shape can become permanent - which can have psychological implications for children as they grow up.

Doctors say if parents move their babies onto their tummies during the day, as well as changing them from different chairs, so there isn't constant pressure on the back of the head, the condition should improve within eight weeks.

However, Mrs Oram was told of a private treatment called helmet therapy, in which babies wear a custom-built helmet which applies pressure to the bulging parts of his skull and relieve pressure from the flatter parts, allowing growth in these areas.

The controversial treatment is not available on the NHS as doctors say there is not enough evidence it works if parents change their babies position in the day.

Mrs Oram decided this treatment would be best for Freddie, but as the helmets cost £2,000, she couldn't afford it.

The family could manage to fund a £500 deposit, but desperately wanted to raise the rest of the money to ensure that Freddie received the treatment.

They were astonished when the local community rushed to aid them, offering to hold a fundraiser at Billingham Synthonia Club, so Freddie would receive a helmet.

Local businesses donated prizes for a raffle, including a brand new car and a football signed by Middlesbrough FC.

Family, friends and other members of the community also made donations.

They have now been able to buy the helmet, which Freddie must wear 23 hours a day, taking it off for only half an hour in the morning or evening.

Ms Oram, who is also a mother to three-year-old Leo said she wanted the treatment as she was worried having an oddly shaped head would affect Freddie in later life.

She said: 'I was told that he would not be able to wear a bike helmet when he was older.

'Little boys also have short hair so you would have been able to see it.

'When we put the helmet on the first few times he would have a cry but he is used to it now. You forget it is there. The only thing is you can't kiss him properly so when it is off you get the kisses.'

Ms Oram and her mother Val want to thank everyone in the local community who helped raise money for Freddie's treatment. Ms Oram said: 'It is nice to know that people I don't even know have shown their support. With it being so close to Christmas too and people still handing out donations, it has been brilliant.'

Freddie has been wearing the helmet for around a month now a recent check revealed the flat part of his head has already grown by 7mm.

After a month he is no longer in the 'serious' category for flat head syndrome, instead he is now in the 'moderate' category, his mother said.

The £2,000 raised will be used to pay for Freddie's helmet as well as a special pillow for when he no longer has to wear it.

Ms Oram said: 'I would like to say a huge thank you to everyone.

If I could afford to pull £2,000 out of my own pocket then I would.

'It is nice to know that people I don't even know have shown their support.

With it being so close to Christmas too and people still handing out donations, it has been brilliant.'
