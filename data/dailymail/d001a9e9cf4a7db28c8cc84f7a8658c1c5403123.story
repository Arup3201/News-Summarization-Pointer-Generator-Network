She's pipped Kim Kardashian and Beyonce to be crowned the best bikini body of the year and her flawless looks are the envy of women worldwide, but that doesn't mean Michelle Keegan doesn't have her fair share of haters.

The 27-year-old, who oozes confidence modelling her new range for Lipsy, has revealed that she often feels scrutinised for her weight and the way she looks.

Speaking to The Express, the star said: 'I do feel under pressure with the way I look. If I lose weight, I'm too skinny, and if I put a few pounds on people are quick to point it out. You can never win. 

Criticism: Michelle Keegan, who this week unveiled her new range for Lipsy, has revealed that she often feels scrutinised for her weight and the way she looks

'It used to affect me more a few years ago, whereas now if I'm feeling good in myself that's all that matters.'

She revealed that in her role as Tina in Coronation Street, she would often be criticised for her looks but the actress has learned to take it all in her stride.

'It wasn't me, it was the character. When I saw myself on screen I didn't think, "Oh, I look awful." A lot of people were slagging me off and mentioning my looks but I didn't care. Sometimes it's hard but I've learned to rise above it now.'

And Michelle has every reason to be feeling confident. After leaving her Corrie days behind, she has been snapped up to design her debut fashion range and has plenty more exciting acting projects in the pipeline.
