Exclusive images of Fast & Furious actor Paul Walker modelling for a designer fashion brand have been pulled after he died in a horrific car crash at the weekend. 

Colcci, a high-end Brazilian clothes and accessories company, announced that it would be shelving the images taken of the Hollywood actor modelling its Winter 2014 collection as a mark of respect to the family.

Instead they released two pictures from the shoot as a tribute to the actor who was 40. The advertising campaign was due to be launched this month.

On Tuesday, Los Angeles County police department confirmed the actor and his close friend and business partner Roger Rodas, who was driving the Porsche Carrera GT, were not racing another vehicle at the time of the fatal crash.

There had been speculation that the collision had occurred following a street race – the sort portrayed in the Fast & Furious movies, and that the former Pirelli World Challenge race car driver was doing 100mph just moments before the accident despite travelling through a 45mph zone.

The fatal incident happened in Santa Clarita, Southern California an area which has a history of street racing.

Walker, who appeared in six of the 
seven films about illegal street racing and heists, had been at an event
 for his charity Reach Out Worldwide before deciding to take the car, a 
cherry-red Porsche, out for a drive with his friend.

Walker
 was a self-confessed adrenaline junkie who enjoyed fast cars, surfing 
and outdoor pursuits. On his official Twitter account, he described 
himself as 'outdoorsman, ocean addict, adrenaline junkie... and I do 
some acting on the side.'

The
 crash took place about 3.30pm on Saturday, about 300 yards from the 
office park where the charity was being held - and where the speed limit
 is 45mph.

Guests rushed to put out the flames with fire extinguishers but the fireball had already engulfed the car.

By Saturday evening, all that remained was the burnt mangled metal of the red car and a light pole that had been knocked down.

Since
 the crash, fans and people wishing to pay their respects have left 
messages of condolence as well as candles and flowers at the site of the
 crash.
