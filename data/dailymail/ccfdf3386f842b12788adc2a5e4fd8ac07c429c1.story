England would be facing Switzerland later in their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign if manager Roy Hodgson had been able to pick and choose the Three Lions' fixtures.

Wayne Rooney and Co take on Vladimir Petkovic's side in Basle on Monday as they begin their bid to reach the European Championships in France.

But Hodgson admits that he would've rather faced Switzerland at a later date as he continues to rebuild after a disastrous World Cup in Brazil.

Asked about England's youthful squad in his pre-match press conference, Hodgson said: 'In an ideal world we would've played Switzerland - our major rival for the No 1 spot in the group - after we had a bit more time forming this group of players into the team we want. 

'You don't get that benefit. It will be a big test for them.'

Hodgson has no new injuries to worry about after the withdrawal of Daniel Sturridge with a thigh problem and the former West Brom boss insists he is content with his attacking options.

'The fact we're pleased with our options is shown by the fact we've not taken anyone in to replace Daniel Sturridge,' he said. 

'We're devastated for him because he was so anxious to play in the game and had to limp out of the training session.'

Sturridge's injury means that Wayne Rooney is almost certain to start as a central striker, although Hodgson was giving nothing away a little over 24 hours before the Three Lions take to the pitch at St Jakob Park.

He said: 'Wayne Rooney has played many positions for England already, certainly he has for me. He's played out on the left, centre forward and behind the centre forward. I'm not really going to tell you where he will play but he can play in a lot of positions.' 

England struggled to a 1-0 win in a friendly with Norway at Wembley earlier this week and Hodgson admits that the result of Monday's game is the most important thing, even if he is hoping for an impressive performance to accompany three points.

Asked what would be a good result against Petkovic's side, the 67-year-old said: 'It depends what happens in the game. If you're losing near the end and get an equaliser you come away feeling good. It's foolish to say the only good result is this or that. I want to see theee how the players perform.

'I want the result. I'll play badly and win given the choice. But we have to lift our heads a little bit. How we play is vitally important.

'We've got reasons to be cheerful if you're able to put behind you that fact that the World Cup was a major disappointment. 

'See the talent of the players and their desire to step forward and do well, then add up to 10 players not here and we're looking at a fairly large group who, if they continue as they started, bodes well for two years' time when they will have played a lot more games.'

Petkovic took charge of the Swiss national side following the departure of Ottmar Hitzfeld after the World Cup but Hodgson is confident that he is well prepared for Monday's game, even if the former Lazio boss may be a little bit of an unknown quantity.

'We do know the players and they'll form the backbone of Petkovic's team,' he said.

'It's not a new England team per se but there's a lot of players that Petkovic and the Swiss people won't have seen too much of.'
