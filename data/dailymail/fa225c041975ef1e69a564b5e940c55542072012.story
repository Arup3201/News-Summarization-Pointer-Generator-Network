A rugby player’s girlfriend scored a spectacular drop goal of her own by losing six st in weight after being told she had 'good legs for rugby'.

Lindsay Briggs, 24, weighed 16st and wore size 20 clothing after years of struggling to control her weight.

The trainee accountant of Bexleyheath, Kent, was shocked into changing her diet and taking up exercise after her well-meaning boyfriend Dave Carey, 25, told her that her larger legs would make her a perfect rugby player.

Lindsay, picture with boyfriend Dave before she lost weight, scored a spectacular drop goal of her own by losing six st in weight after Dave innocently told her she had 'good legs for rugby'

She said: 'I laughed it off at first, because it was obviously a joke. Then I realised that he wouldn’t have said it unless it was at least partly true.

'I looked down and thought, ‘my goodness, he’s right’. I knew then that I had to do something about it.'

Miss Briggs said her problems with weight gain began when she was still in school.

She said: 'I’d always been larger but had managed to lose a couple of stone by the time I met Dave in 2010.

Dropped from 16st and a size 20 to a trim 10st and her waist is now the same size as one of Dave's thighs

'But then the weight piled back on as I fell into our new, comfortable relationship. I often went to watch Dave play rugby, where the only food available was fatty snacks. It became a cycle.'

Miss Briggs frequently supported Mr Carey, a bricklayer and prop forward for Dartfordians RFC, by accompanying him to matches.

A conversation on the way to a match in the winter of 2012 proved a turning point.

She said: 'Dave didn’t mean any harm but, joking or not, I realised I didn’t want rugby legs. I suddenly thought, ‘how could I have let myself get like this?"'

In early March 2013 Miss Briggs joined her local Slimming World group and kicked junk food into touch for good. She also joined a local sports centre and began participating in jazzercize classes three times a week.

Lindsay say that as she became comfortable in her relationship with Dave (pictured together) she piled on the pounds through unhealthy snacking

Lindsay used to eat  typically ate a croissant with strawberry cream and a chocolate bar with a packet of crisps for breakfast alone, and snack more chocolate, energy drinks and takeaways through the day

Before beginning her weight loss regime, Miss Briggs typically ate a croissant with strawberry cream and a chocolate bar with a packet of crisps for breakfast, a tuna melt sandwich with another chocolate bar for lunch, followed by burger and chips or an Indian takeaway for dinner. She would also consume several cans of energy drink during the day.

Today, she eats a pre-prepared oat and yogurt mix for breakfast, followed by tuna steak with portion-controlled pasta for lunch, and turkey with vegetables for evening meal. She still snacks, but limits her intake to the occasional sweet or packet of crackers with cheese dip.

This March, a year after beginning her weight loss journey, she reached her target weight of 10st.

She said: 'My waist size is now the same size as one of Dave’s thighs. I’m so proud of what I’ve achieved.

'Thankfully there have been no more ‘rugby legs’ comments. Dave can’t get over the difference I’ve managed to make through hard work.

'I feel so much more positive and energised now. I’ll never let myself go back to the way I was.

'I found that giving myself little mottos to repeat helped enormously. One of my favourites is ‘wake up determined, go to sleep satisfied’. It’s  helped me resist the urges to overeat.

'Perhaps I could still play rugby, but I wouldn’t be able to be a prop any more. Now I’d be more suited to the wing.'
