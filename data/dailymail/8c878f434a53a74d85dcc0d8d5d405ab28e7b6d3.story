The wife of a top New York doctor has been charged with allegedly stalking his glamorous mistress, bombarding her with abusive messages and threatening to shoot the woman dead.

Amy Goldenberg, 42, has been accused of stalking Einat Packman, 40, for more than a year after learning she was having an affair with her prominent pulmonologist husband Ronald Goldenberg, 44.

Mrs Goldenberg has been arrested at least four times over the love triangle - for harassment,  stalking and violating an order of protection by sending a slew of threatening messages to her estranged husband and his new flame, branding her 'a homewrecking w****'.

The former couple, who have been married for 16 years and have three children together, are now going through a divorce and Mrs Goldenberg will appear in court to face the charges next week.

'He cheated on me for years. He left me for this woman,' Mrs Goldenberg, who insists she is the victim, told the New York Daily News. 'She's nuts!'

Court papers show that Mrs Goldenberg started contacting Packman in December 2011 when she suspected she was having an affair with her husband.

'Are you having sex with my husband?' she allegedly said during phone calls. 'Leave my husband alone. He's married.'

Accused: She also allegedly threatened to shoot dead her husband's mistress last year

Mrs Goldenberg, who still lives in the couple's mansion in Closter, New Jersey, was first arrested in May 2012 for allegedly harassing and stalking Packman.

She was then arrested in August, November and February this year after violating the order of protection.

She allegedly bombarded her husband with texts calling his mistress a 'homewrecking w****.'

In June last year, she allegedly called her husband to tell him she was outside Packman's house and was going to kill her.

'I have a gun and I’m going to shoot her, so keep laughing,' she said, according to court papers.

A hearing in Manhattan Supreme Court for Mrs Goldenberg was scheduled for Wednesday but has been postponed until next week.

She told the New York Daily News that the threats came from both sides.

'He threatened custody of the kids,' she said. 'He had gone around town making up lies about me.'

Her lawyer, George Farkas, said that his client had been upset by the couple's actions and had acted inappropriately. He said she is entering into a conditional plea.
