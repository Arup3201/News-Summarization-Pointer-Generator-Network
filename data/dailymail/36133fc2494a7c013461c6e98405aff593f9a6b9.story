The first anniversary of the bloody Marikana mine massacre was marked today by the victims' families as a police officer involved in shootings admitted he had no regrets about the killings.

Police opened fire on thousands of strikers at platinum producer Lonmin's mine northwest of Johannesburg, killing 34 and injuring 78 people.

The August shooting was described as the worst police brutality since the end of apartheid two decades ago.

A policeman who took part in the killings insisted he did not do anything wrong. 

The officer who did not want his identity to be revealed for fear of reprisals told Sky News: 'What we did was not wrong,' he said.

'We
 were protecting our lives and we were trying to effect arrest because 
those people were illegally gathered and they were instructed to get 
away, go to their homes.

'I
 am not feeling sorry for what I did but I feel sorry for those people 
who passed away. My overall feeling is that I think we were right 
because these people, they were dangerous, also to our lives.'

South Africa's ANC government pulled 
out at the last minute from the memorial ceremony marking the 
anniversary of the nation's bloodiest post-apartheid labor violence, 
drawing attention to the dominant party's loss of support among many 
mineworkers.

President
 Jacob Zuma's government had planned a unifying day of prayer and 
reflection to commemorate the killings.

Shocking: It was deadliest incident of its kind since the 1994 end of white-minority rule, it shocked South Africans and the world

But just hours before the planned commemoration went ahead at the mine northeast
 of Johannesburg, a government spokeswoman said no one from Zuma's 
government would appear.

A request by miners taking part in the Farlam Commission of Inquiry for help in paying their legal fess has been refused by Lonmin.

A July 25 letter refusing the request was sent to the Hola Bon Renaissance Foundation, reports iolnews.

It reads: 'We certainly support you in the belief that it is right that all interested parties continue to have a voice at the commission. However, given the conflict inherent in Lonmin providing financial assistance to a party with whom it may be in opposition and the negative perceptions this could raise, we cannot accede to your requests.'

A meeting has now been set up between Lonmin  and the foundation project manager Lebogang Moima.

More than a dozen seats for cabinet ministers on the main stage were empty when ceremonies started.

Zuma, who faces an election next year, has come under fire from critics
 over the government's clumsy handling of what has come to be known as 
the 'Marikana massacre', including questions over alleged police 
brutality.

The Marikana killings were among 60 deaths during a wave of illegal strikes and labor violence in the country's mines that started last year and spilled over into this year.

The violence helped trigger credit downgrades for Africa's biggest economy and dented the image of the ANC government. Zuma's ruling ANC said it would not participate in Friday's memorial because the event was being organized by a Marikana support group, which includes the hardline Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU).

'We are not participating in this activity,' ANC spokesman Ishmael Mnisi told Reuters. 'People are taking advantage of a tragedy for their own political benefit.'

The labor union ally of Zuma's ANC, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), which has been displaced by the more hardline AMCU as the dominant union among miners in the area, said it was also staying away, for safety reasons.

'It's important that we commemorate those who lost their lives, but it is not necessary that we go and commemorate only to lose more lives. The possibility of losing further lives is great,' NUM spokesman Lesiba Seshoka said.

The more radical AMCU accuses the ANC government and its NUM union allies of siding with mining bosses over the interests of workers fighting for better pay and conditions.

The two unions have been involved in a deadly war for members among South Africa's mineworkers, accusing each other of being behind killings of members over the past few months.

At Marikana, thousands of people, many of them wearing green AMCU T-shirts, gathered on and around the rocky outcrop dubbed by media the 'Hill of Horror' where the strikers were killed last year, most falling in a hail of police gunfire.

Marikana worker Paulos Mpahlela, 60, expressed anger at the government and ANC's decision to stay away. 'We are hurt, the government should be here.

They should have taken the trouble to come and be here because they're the leaders,' he said. '

The decision by the ruling party and government to stay away highlights the alienation of many of South Africa's poorest workers from the ANC, Nelson Mandela's liberation movement which has dominated South Africa since the end of apartheid.

The ANC is still expected to win elections easily next year, but increasingly suffers from accusations that it has become the party of the rich and powerful.

'What it shows is that the ANC, the NUM and the government have lost their legitimacy in that region which has become enemy territory. It is a unique situation when the NUM and ANC cannot appear somewhere,' Cape Town-based political analyst Nic Borain told Reuters.

AMCU denies that its aggressive recruitment tactics are behind the unrest in South Africa's mines, which has injected added tension into the latest round of wage bargaining currently underway between mining companies and unions.

Attending the Marikana commemoration, AMCU president Joseph Mathunjwa called it a 'sad day' that should not be used for political 'electioneering'.

The threat of an immediate fresh strike at Marikana was eased this week when Lonmin, the world's No. 3 platinum producer, signed a deal with AMCU recognizing it as the majority union at its mine, although labor tension remains high.

A government commission of inquiry was due to conclude its investigation into the Marikana shootings by last December but proceedings stalled and lately were suspended because of lack of funding for lawyers representing the victims.

Rights group Amnesty International urged the government to ensure that inquiry was fully completed.

'There seems to be a critical lack of political will to ensure that the police and those responsible for the police fully account for their actions,' Amnesty's Deputy Programme Director for Africa Noel Kututwa said in a statement.
