She's renowned for her glowing complexion and flawless skin.

So it's no wonder Kim Kardashian's tanner was brought in to bronze a collection of the world's most beautiful women at the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show on Tuesday night.

Renowned beautician Jimmy Coco worked on supermodels including Adriana Lima and Alessandra Ambrosio - who both sported a noticeably deep mahogany glow - plus Behati Prinsloo and Doutzen Kroes.

Alessandra and Adriana, both 33, showed off their glow as they strutted their stuff down the runway in dazzling $2million Dream Angels Fantasy Bras.

Jimmy used an incredible 3.5 litres of fake tan to prep the stunning beauties for their moment on stage.

And he revealed his top tanning secrets ahead of his ninth year working on the annual lingerie show - which was held in London's Earl's Court Arena.

According to the Telegraph, Jimmy uses up to three coats of tanner on each model, which takes approximately 25 minutes per layer and lasts for seven days.

The false tan connoisseur told the paper how his process involves more than 40 cans, which totals almost 3.5 litres of product.

Jimmy has plenty of tools to help him along the way, including a mini airbrush applicator, two tanning tents and 24ft hose.

When asked why the models require so much lotion, he said: 'Angels have the most beautiful long legs, which require lots of tanning liquid.'

The 'tan man' then revealed how a chance encounter with Victoria's Secret model Miranda Kerr led him to his current role in the lingerie runway show.

He said: 'The VS Fashion Show came to Los Angeles in 2006. I lived a block away from [then] Kodak Theater where the show was happening. I waited in the hotel lobby and introduced myself to Miranda Kerr as she walked by, and offered her a spray tan.

'Soon, all of the Angels were asking for a tan and I have been hired to be Victoria's Secret Fashion Show Tan Man ever since.'

The highlight of the annual Victoria's Secret catwalk event is always the reveal of the Fantasy Bra, of which this year there were two, each of them designed and made by Mouawad jewellers for the lingerie brand.

The jewellery makers created the bras using 16,000 rubies, diamonds and sapphires, all of which are strung together with 18-carat gold. The ornate ensembles took the designers more than 1,380 hours to make. 

Adriana wore the blue and silver version of the swanky lingerie, her toned body bedecked in intricate jewellery across her decolletage, down her torso and over her slim hips.

Alessandra had the pleasure of wearing the red bra, and was covered in even more body jewellery than her colleague, accentuating her enviably trim shape, flat stomach and muscular yet lean thighs.

Each of the models - who have been Victoria's Secret Angels for years (Adriana since 2000, Alessandra since 2004) - were adorned with large, flowing capes matching the colour of their underwear, adding to the drama of the moment.

In mid-November, they had taken the elaborate bras to the Fashion Show Mall in Las Vegas, Nevada to pose with the bejeweled creations.

Most of the shoes of the night were designed by Sophia Webster, while some of the boots were Nicholas Kirkwood - coming in at a whopping £10,000.
