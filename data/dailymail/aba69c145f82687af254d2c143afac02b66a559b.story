Hundreds of gay rights activists held a peaceful protest at the California mall where a couple were told to leave because they were kissing and holding hands.

Daniel Chesmore, 21, and Jose Guzman, 24, recorded a security guard at the Roseville mall in Sacramento, California telling them: 'If you continue to kiss, you will be asked to leave the mall. Period.'

Guzman said afterwards: 'I feel like we’re always treated differently because we’re gay. It makes me sad.'

The aim of Saturday's rally was to get the mall
 'to understand why the community was hurt by their response', Shara 
Murphy, executive director of the Sacramento LGBT Community Center told
CBS.

'What's important is love, and all love is love, and we respect individuals and their right to love.'
she said she hoped the mall would have better training for their employees.

Robert Woodward, who attended the 
Love is Love rally, said: 'We have every right, just as everyone does, 
to feel comfortable in our own skin, loving our partners.'

People at the event carried banners with the hashtag '#loveislove' and wore T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan.

During the recording by the couple, the voice, allegedly of the security guard, said: 'I counted you guys kissing 25 times.'

The security guard told the couple, who are teachers at an elementary school in Oakland, California, that he would eject anyone for such public displays of affection.

Roseville Galleria staff offered food 
and water for everyone at the rally and said they wanted everyone to be 
comfortable at the event.

Initially the mall defended the security guard's actions but changed its mind after the response from the community.

It first told Fox40 that anyone who violates the mall's code of conduct will be asked to leave.

One supporter at the rally sported a T-shirt saying 'It's all fun and gay 'til someone loses their rights'

However, Fox found nothing in the code of conduct that prohibits public displays of affection and spotted dozens of heterosexual couples openly being 
affectionate with each other without being asked to leave.

It is not known if the guard was disciplined for the incident.

Representatives from the mall met event organizers before the rally and told CBS Sacramento they wanted to support it.

In an interview after the incident, Chesmore said: 'In a perfect world, there would be no difference in treatment between straight couples and gay couples.'

'It makes me feel like no matter what I do in society, I will always be different.'

Code of conduct: The Westfield Galleria in Roseville said at first that couple were violating rules about public displays of affection but backed down after the response from the local LGBT community
