More than 30 pro-Russian and Chechen 'terrorists' have been killed during gun battles in eastern Ukraine as tensions in the region continue to escalate.

Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said on his Facebook page that four government troops also died and another 20 were injured during clashes between local forces and pro-Moscow militia in Slovyansk.

Fighting took place at various positions around the city during the government's biggest effort to quash unrest in the mainly Russian-speaking east.

Armed: The soldiers patrol the city after more than 30 pro-Russia troops were killed in gun battles

Ukrainian forces had taken hold of a key checkpoint north of the city, dealing a blow to insurgent lines of communication.

The checkpoint had come under repeated attack since the government offensive began.

In the southwest, Kiev authorities also attempted to reassert control over the key Black Sea region of Odessa by appointing a new governor there. 

In Donetsk, a city 120km south of Slovyansk, flights from the local airport were suspend.

Heightening tensions: The death toll from a military offensive in a flashpoint town in east Ukraine rose to at least 34, amid fresh warnings of civil war and the shutdown of a major airport in the region

A
 display board showed international departures had 
been cancelled and only outbound flights to the capital, Kiev, were 
still in operation.

The
 airport said on its website that the cancellations followed a 
government order.

It was not immediately clear how long 
the suspension was due to remain in effect.

Avakov said Monday that pro-Russia forces were deploying large-calibre weapons, mortars with both sides suffering casualties.

Ukraine
 is facing its worst crisis in decades as the polarized nation of 46 
million tries to decide whether to look toward Europe, as its western 
regions want to, or improve ties with Russia, which is favored by the 
many Russian-speakers in the east.

Dozens
 of government offices have been seized, either by armed insurgents or 
anti-government crowds, over the past several weeks.

The goals of the pro-Russian 
insurgency are geared toward pushing for broader powers of 
autonomy for the region, but some insurgents do favor separatism.

Leaders
 of the anti-government movement say they plan to hold a referendum on 
autonomy for eastern regions on May 11, although visible preparations 
for the vote have been negligable.

The
 Russian Foreign Ministry has put the blame on the unrest squarely on 
Kiev, which it says 'stubbornly continues to wage war against the people
 of its own country.'

The ministry has urged what it called the 'Kiev 
organizers of the terror' to pull back their troops from the east and 
hold peaceful negotiations to resolve the crisis.

British
 Foreign Secretary William Hague is suggesting that the unrest in eastern 
Ukraine is being fostered by Russia to disrupt the presidential 
elections on May 25.

Devastated: Family members mourn during the service. Her death followed pitched gun battles between Ukrainian troops and pro-Russia militia

He is also urging a gathering of European foreign ministers to rally in support of the vote.

Hague spoke at a foreign ministers' meeting of the 47-nation Council of Europe in Vienna. Also present were the Ukrainian and Russian foreign ministers.

He told reporters: 'Russia is clearly intent on preventing or disrupting those elections,' while asserting that foreign ministers at the meeting will express 'strong support" for holding the vote without outside interference.

Handover: Russian lawmaker Vladimir Zhirinovsky, dressed as paratrooper, gestures during meeting with press as he gives his vehicle, a GAZ-2975 Tigr, to pro-Russian activists from eastern Ukraine

Gesture: He waved the driver off as they took the vehicle to areas where tensions are continuing to escalate

He also said nations supporting Ukraine remain ready to find a diplomatic solution to reduce tensions generated by the pro-Russian insurgency in eastern Ukraine but 'that would require stronger Russian commitment.'

In Kramatorsk, a separatist-held town in the east that saw an advance by Ukrainian troops at the weekend, the coffin of 21-year-old nurse Yulia Izotova was carried through streets stilled by barricades of tyres and tree trunks. She was killed by shots fired from a Ukrainian military column.

A small crowd of about 50 stood around the body, covering it with carnations and roses. A Ukrainian flag fluttered in the wind, and a patriotic song about dead heroes was played from a sound system.
