The biological family of a little girl taken from her foster parents and returned to her jailbird father have branded her adoptive mom and dad, ‘selfish’ for fighting to get her back and vowed never to give her up again.

Sonya, aged nine, had been in the care of Kim and David Hodgin, from Dickson, Tennessee for more than seven years, but she was recently handed over to ex-con John McCaul in Omaha, Nebraska.

The Hodgin family have released a heart-breaking phone conversation, revealing Sonya’s desperate pleas, begging to be reunited with them.

Desperate pleas: The Hodgin family has released heartbreaking phone conversations in which Sonya begs to be reunited with them

And they have claimed the school girl,
 "cried her eyes out", screaming, "Please don't let them do this, Daddy,
 please, Mama, don't let 'em take me," when she was forcibly removed 
from them.

But a female 
relative of McCaul – a convicted felon who served time for transporting 
firearms – has hit back at the Hodgins, branding them "selfish" and 
accusing them of not have the little girl’s best interests at heart.

Speaking
 from Omaha, Nebraska, the woman, who asked not to be named, said: ‘This
 is not the way to do things. If you don’t get what you want you 
shouldn’t behave like they are.

‘They
 are spreading all kinds of dirt about John, but they don’t know him. 
Sonya should never have been with them in the first place. She wasn’t 
treated badly. She’s the most important person in John’s life.

‘His
 mother, Sonya’s grandmother, never gave up on her and has been fighting
 to get her back all this time. Her real family love her.

‘What
 is happening now is not in the best interests of the child. They are 
foster parents, but they are plastering her picture all over the 
internet and selling t-shirts with her face on to pay for lawyers’ fees.
 I have never seen that kind of behavior.

Tragedy: Mrs Hodgin and her husband were just given three hours notice before their adoptive daughter was taken from their home in Dickson County, Tennessee and moved to Omaha, Nebraska

‘John
 has had to take Sonya into hiding because he is being targeted by 
people. Some people stole his trash and tried to steal his truck.

‘I
 feel sorry for the Hodgin’s because they have a relationship with Sonya
 and if it was up to us, they would continue to see her, but they are 
making that impossible, because they want to take her back permanently.

‘We
 are never going to let that happen. She is family and families don’t 
just give up on each other. They have no blood link to her. They have no
 right to her and if you ask me, their lawyer needs to tell them to shut
 their mouths.’

The 
family member also revealed McCaul has been in prison for an armed 
robbery as well as transporting a gun across state lines. But she 
defended him saying: ‘John got into trouble when he was a kid, I’m not 
going to deny that.

‘But the robbery was not his fault. He told some guys how to do a robbery, but he wasn’t with them when they did it.

‘It
 was the same with the gun charge. He was running a security firm and he
 wasn’t allowed to have a gun. A woman was in his car and she had one, 
but it wasn’t in a holster, so as it was in her car, he was charged.

‘But he has served his time and has straightened up. He just wants to start a new life with his daughter.’

McCaul was in court in Tennessee on Friday after the Hodgins petitioned to have her returned to them on Sonya’s best interest.

The family adopted her in 2008, but a Tennessee appeals court overturned that after McCaul was released from prison.

In
 a recording of a phone call made on January 30 this year, a day after 
Sonya was moved from Dickson County to Omaha, she can be heard asking 
for her adoptive parents to take her back.'What did you say, baby doll?' Mrs Hodgin can be heard asking in a recording of the phone call obtained by CNN.

'I want to you to come and get me', the young girl responds.

During
 the phone call, the last time the Hodgins spoke to her, Sonya also 
describes her biological father's home as 'dirty, with mold and 
cigarettes everywhere,' and although the man is 'nice' to her, the home 
lacks clean water.

Convicted felon: Sonya has no memory of her father Josh McCaul, left, but a court still ruled she should live with him

The Hodgins say they were given just three hours' notice before the young girl was taken from them.'Sonya's
 crying her eyes out. Screaming bloody murder, "Please don't let them do
 this, Daddy, please, Mama, don't let 'em take me,",' Mr Hodgin told 
CNN.

'They took her bags, and that's the last that I've seen her,' Mrs Hodgin adds.

McCaul had been awarded custody of his infant daughter in 2004 after Sonya's mother gave up her rights.

However,
 she has been living with the Hodgins since 2006 and they were able to 
adopt Sonya after McCaul pleaded guilty to transporting firearms and was
 sentenced to 15 years in federal prison.

This
 automatically terminated his parental rights as Tennessee state law 
does not allow anyone incarcerated for more than ten years to have 
rights to a child under the age of eight.

But
 his sentence was shortened to just eight years and he was able to 
retain it upon his release from prison after claiming his parental 
rights were illegally terminated.

In
 2009, McCaul won an appeal claiming he did not voluntarily give up his 
rights and the court did not follow due process in the adoption 
proceedings.

For the next five years, Sonya continued to live with the Hodgins on their Tennessee farm as the two sides fought for custody.

In
 January this year, a judge ruled that the nine-year-old should return 
to her biological father, and a few hours later, she had been taken from
 the Hodgins.

DCS 
spokesman Rob Johnson said earlier this year that while foster parents 
often come to love the children in their care, the law is clear, 'Birth 
parents have the right to raise their children.'
