Germany last night declared that 
Britain would be forced to scrap the pound and join the euro – as David 
Cameron returned home empty-handed from crisis talks in Berlin.

In a highly-provocative intervention,
 German finance minister Wolfgang Schauble suggested the UK’s struggling
 economy meant the pound was doomed, and urged the Prime Minister to 
back Europe’s ailing single currency.

Mr Schauble said the euro would 
emerge stronger from the current crisis – leaving Britain on the 
sidelines unless it signed up. He said Britain would be forced to join 
‘faster than some people on the British island think’ – despite a pledge
 by Mr Cameron never to do so.

Tory MP Philip Davies suggested Mr Schauble was ‘living in cloud cuckoo land’ and should concentrate on resolving the crisis.

He added: ‘Rather than telling us 
what to do he should be listening to what people in Germany want – I’m 
pretty sure they would rather have the Deutschmark back than bail out 
Greece and Italy.’ 

But Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the 
powerful Euro Group of eurozone finance ministers, said Britain was in 
no position to comment on the crisis as its deficit was twice the 
European average.

The Conservatives have long promised a referendum on repatriating powers from the EU, but have not yet delivered one.

Angela Merkel's comments today make a referendum less likely, as her 'limited treaty change' will not have to be approved by countries outside the euro, including the UK.

The Coalition's 'referendum lock' commits the Government to holding a public vote the next time Britain is supposed to sign up to a new treaty which would hand more power to Brussels.

But if the eurozone countries try to solve the debt crisis by closer economic integration, the UK will have no say - even though this could have a massive impact on Britain.

Although no referendum will be held, there is nothing to stop the Government from trying to repatriate powers by itself, but without a popular mandate it will be taken less seriously by other EU countries.

He said he was ‘not in favour of being dictated to by countries that are doing worse than us’.

Mr Schauble’s comments came as Mr 
Cameron arrived to a hostile reception in Berlin for talks on the 
eurozone crisis with German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Senior members of 
Mrs Merkel’s ruling coalition voiced their irritation at London’s 
‘lecturing’ over the crisis.

Leading German magazine  Der Spiegel ran a prominent feature describing Britain as the ‘dis- eased empire’.

And Rainer Brüderle, head of Mrs Merkel’s coalition partners, said: ‘Britain can’t be freeloaders in the eurozone.’

The deputy leader of Mrs Merkel’s 
party, Michael Meister, criticised Britain for lecturing the eurozone on
 what steps it should take while not actively contributing towards a 
solution.

He also warned Mr Cameron against 
catering to nationalist sentiment on the euro, saying turmoil in the 
single currency area could have a devastating impact on countries 
outside the eurozone and on London’s financial industry.

Mrs Merkel flatly rejected Mr  
Cameron’s key demand to allow the European Central Bank to pump in 
hundreds of billions of euros to prop up the euro and prevent a new 
recession.

But in a sign of growing nervousness 
about the crisis, the ECB yesterday intervened to buy up Spanish and 
Italian government bonds to prevent market speculation driving interest 
rates to unsustainable levels.

The German Chancellor also made clear
 she would press ahead with EU treaty reforms, even if they are opposed 
by Britain – although she said she was prepared to show ‘tolerance and 
forbearance’.
  Berlin has drawn up secret plans designed to bypass the threat of a British referendum on treaty reforms.

Greeting: Mr Cameron and Mrs Merkel met in Berlin yesterday for crisis talks on the future of the EU

Meeting: Earlier, Mr Cameron held talks with EU president Herman Van Rompuy, right, in Brussels

Talks: Mr Cameron also met with Jose Manuel Barroso, right, president of the European Commission

A leaked German memo stated: ‘Limiting 
the effect of the treaty changes to the eurozone states would make 
ratification easier, which would nevertheless be required by all EU 
member states (thereby less referenda could be necessary, which could 
also affect the UK).’

The bond yields of troubled eurozone governments have remained stubbornly high today.

Both Italy and Spain are hovering around the seven per cent barrier at which repayment costs are considered to be unsustainable.

These were the 10-year bond yields of European countries at 2pm today.

Italy - 6.77%

Spain - 6.48%

France - 3.56%

Greece - 28.88%

Portugal - 11.42%

Ireland - 8.38%

UK - 2.22%

Germany - 1.90%

The memo will add to fears that 
Germany wants to use the eurozone crisis to create a European ‘super 
state’ with its own tax and spend policies.

Last night a Downing Street source 
insisted that all 27 member states had to agree to treaty changes even 
if they only affected the 17 eurozone members. He said there would be no
 need for a referendum as long as powers were not taken from the UK and 
handed to Brussels.

Mrs Merkel is determined to establish
 a new European Monetary Fund with powers to intervene directly in the 
economies of member states.

Former prime minister Sir John Major 
last night spoke out about the ‘undemocratic’ drive towards greater 
fiscal union in the eurozone.

He warned of the danger posed by EU 
plans to impose a new tax on financial transactions, which he described 
as a ‘heat-seeking missile’ targeted at the City of London.

Mr Cameron yesterday rejected German 
calls for an EU-wide tax. But he was silent on previous demands for the 
repatriation of powers to Britain.

At a joint press conference with Mrs Merkel the pair admitted they had made ‘no progress’ on key fault lines.

Tory MP Mark Reckless last night said
 there would be an unanswerable case for a referendum in this country if
 the eurozone decided to press ahead with treaty changes unilaterally. 
He said: ‘I have no objection to them pressing ahead with creating a 
Europe of 17 but we would have to reconsider our own relationship with 
that.

‘It would be them leaving us rather than us leaving them – and that would be a very good basis for a referendum.’

Former Tory leadership contender 
David Davis yesterday called on Mr Cameron to exploit the crisis to 
demand the repatriation of key powers in areas such as employment 
rights.

But Downing Street last night played 
down expectations of a major repatriation of powers. Ministers are 
instead focusing on securing an opt-out from the financial transactions 
tax.

Despite the tensions Mr Cameron and 
Mrs Merkel attempted to put on a show of unity for the cameras 
yesterday. Mr Cameron said: ‘It’s a good relationship. We have strong 
agreement on key issues about action the European economy needs to 
take.’

But he added: ‘It is obvious that we 
don’t agree on every aspect of European policy, but I am clear that we 
can address and accommodate and deal with those differences.’

Germany’s press has made much of the British prime minister’s differences with Angela Merkel.

The media has hardly been the best of friends with Mrs Merkel of late, but it is firmly on her side when it comes to dealing with the ‘old enemy’.

Bild carried the headlines ‘Briten 
zittern vor Deutschlands Euro-Plänen’ – ‘Britons tremble before 
Germany’s euro plans’ – and ‘Europa spricht deutsch, Herr Cameron! Was 
wollen die Engländer eigentlich noch in der EU?’ – ‘Europe speaks 
German, Mr Cameron! What do the English actually want in the European 
Union?’

Financial Times Deutschland wrote: ‘He wants Britain to have a say in the financial crisis, but he doesn’t want his country to have to pay for it.

‘He wants to prevent a core Europe (of Germany and France) from forming,  but at the same time he is unwilling  to contribute to deeper European  integration. Great Britain is lacking a  constructive approach.

‘That’s why the government in London shouldn’t be surprised that it is hearing an increasing number of European countries sigh words like: Things would be a lot easier if we didn’t have the Brits.’

Conservative Die Welt added: ‘Britain is fighting for its future in Europe more vigorously than it has in a long time. The Continent, from which Britain always tried to keep its distance, is unmistakably heading toward a future of more integration, right in front of Albion’s front door.

‘Cameron is constantly talking of “repatriating” powers back to the United Kingdom from Brussels.

‘Does he have nothing else to say about the future of Europe than the constant mantra of a Little Englander?

‘Does he not know about the new treaty negotiations that would be necessary in such a case – at a time when Europe has bigger things to worry about than the concerns of British euroskeptics?’

And the influential business journal Handelsblatt criticised Mr Cameron – but also warned that Germany needs Britain in the EU.

‘Why should the Chancellor worry just now about the British who have so little to offer?’ it asked.

‘If Cameron strews sand into the German efforts toward EU reform, the 17 eurozone countries will do it themselves.  

‘But Germany remembers more  than Frenchmen the complicated outsider role of the British – and their meaning in European history.

‘Would it be intelligent to marginalise it, to do without its weight with regard to foreign policy? How would it stand without its defence capabilities? Would there be a domestic market without it today?’
