Pop star lawsuit: David Cassidy is reportedly in a legal battle with tenants at his Fort Lauderdale home who have refused to pay rent since August

Seventies pop star David Cassidy is in a legal battle with tenants who refuse to pay their rent.

Cassidy, 62, and his wife Sue Shifrin have filed an eviction lawsuit against tenants Nick and Anne Economos who are renting their house in Fort Lauderdale, Florida it has been reported.

Cassidy has claimed that the pair stopped paying rent in August, now owing $10,000 (£6,272) as of at the end of September as he prepares for his UK Once in a Lifetime Tour.

The tenants claim to have struck a deal with lender who manages the mortgage for the house which stipulates that they do not have to pay rent, TMZ reported.

Cassidy, then aged 20, became famous playing the part of 16-year-old Keith Partridge in TV show The Partridge Family.

The show was to turn him into one of the world's biggest stars, becoming a pop star whose success went global with hits like Could It Be Forever and I Think I Love You. 

David has always enjoyed rabid support here. On his first trip to Britain in 1972, thousands of hysterical teenage girls camped outside the Dorchester hotel in London, serenading him with his own songs and effectively putting him under house arrest in his own suite.

When London hotels refused to 
accommodate him after that, he chartered a yacht on the Thames, only to 
watch as his more intrepid fans plunged into the river and swam towards 
him. 

Eventually it just 
became easier for him to land at Heathrow, perform on the Tarmac for Top
Of The Pops and then take the 11-hour flight back to LA once he'd 
finished the song.

He said in 2008: 'Those were insane times. Crazy, and I've probably had more attention than anyone on the face of the Earth save Paul McCartney, Madonna and Michael Jackson. But I never sought the fame; I was always trying to hide from it.’

Cassidy is set to start his UK leg of his latest tour in Birmingham tomorrow along with ellow Seventies stars Leo Sayer, 64, and Errol Brown, 63, of Hot Chocolate. The tour is also heading to Manchester, London, Newcastle, Cardiff, Sheffield and Liverpool.

He said: ‘I’ve always had a special 
relationship with the UK fans, because even when I wasn’t working they 
were very supportive. 

‘My music was never considered cool, but I’ve always felt that connection with the audience.

‘November
really is a celebration for me and the UK fans who have been so loyal. 
I’m not saying that I won’t tour again, but the chances are slim because
my priorities are different now.’

Cassidy went through two short-lived marriages. The first to actress Kay Lenz lasted four years, while the second to Meryl-Ann Tanz, a horse breeder, lasted just two. 

In the mid-Eighties, however, he bumped into songwriter Sue Shifrin, with whom he had a brief fling, and the couple eventually married in 1991. 

The arrival of their son Beau in that same year proved a turning point in his life, enabling him to work through many of his unresolved feelings towards his father, who walked out when Cassidy was just three-and-a-half-years-old.

Cassidy also has a 21-year- old daughter, Katie, from a brief relationship he had with model Sherry Williams. Though Katie did not grow up with her father, the two are now close.
