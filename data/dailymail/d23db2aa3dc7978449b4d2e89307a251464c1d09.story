A war memorial has been vandalised just two weeks before Remembrance Sunday after thieves broke open a collection box to steal just a few coins.

The vandals caused £400 worth of damage to the RAF memorial in Lytham St Anne's, Lancashire by using an angle grinder to get into the box.

The theft follows a spate of vandalism at war memorials carried out by unscrupulous criminals across the country who sold off metal plaques and statues to scrap dealers.

Vandalism: This collection box in a war memorial in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire was cut open by thieves

Note: This hand-written message was left on the memorial by volunteers as an apology to visitors

Volunteers at the 
Second World War memorial visited the site on Saturday morning to find 
that the collection box which is built in to the structure had had its 
door sawn off and its contents emptied.

Fundraisers
have now launched a campaign to find those responsible, and have left a
hand-written note apologising for the damage, which will cost £400 to 
repair.

It reads: 
'Temp[orarily] out of order due to mindless thieves who felt their need 
for a few pennies was greater than the need to remember the RAF war 
dead. We will fix ASAP. Thanks for your support.'

The
collection box was set into a display made from an antique bomb - it is normally
emptied every day, but last week it was not checked between Thursday 
and Saturday thanks to inclement weather.

Commemoration: The memorial recognises the contribution made to the Second World War by the RAF

Heartless: The vandalism, which will cost £400 to repair, came two weeks before Remembrance Sunday

The RAF Fighter, Bomber and Coastal Command memorial also features a replica Spitfire, which was not damaged by the theft.

Police are investigating the incident and reviewing CCTV footage in an attempt to catch the thief, who struck two weeks before the Remembrance Sunday commemoration on November 10.

The culprit will have been able to take no more than a small amount of change, according to the memorial fund's chairman, John Coombes.

'The repair costs will have to come out of the memorial funds, which we are currently collecting for a memorial garden,' he said.

Patched up: The collection box has been targeted by thieves at least twice before

Fury: John Coombes, chairman of the memorial fund, has hit out at the vandals

'This is a crime not only against our members but against the whole community, because it is the community which will suffer from the lack of improvement to the park around our memorial.

'These people have cost us £400 for a handful of coppers. It's like pinching a Poppy Appeal collection box - it's exactly the same lowlife thing to do.'

The collection box has previously been targeted - shortly before the memorial officially opened in May, vandals damaged the box by kicking it, while a few weeks ago someone tried to take the lock off the box.

Mr Coombes said: 'Whoever went down there went equipped to get inside, and it must have taken some time to get in.

'I'm amazed no one has come forward to say they heard or saw something.'

Historic: The thieves apparently had no regard for the sentimental importance of the memorial

Previous thefts from war memorials have often been blamed on the high value of scrap metal.

In June this year, a statue of a soldier which stood atop a memorial to casualties of the First World War in Fife was taken and apparently sold.

And shortly before the last Remembrance Sunday, a plaque bearing the names of fallen war heroes was stolen from a memorial in Essex.

In 2012, an undercover investigation by the Daily Mail revealed that many scrap metal dealers are willing to buy plaques and similar objects even when told they were stolen from memorials.
