At least 14 people were killed in Brazil yesterday when the bus they were travelling in drove off the road and plunged down a steep ravine.

The bus, which was carrying around 50 people, was heading from theÂ city of Curitiba to Rio de Janeiro when it careered off the road in a wooded area close to Sao Paulo.

The bus then tumbled some 165 feet down the gully, killing 13 of those on board with another passenger later dying in hospital.
