Inter Milan have given up hope of signing Tottenham winger Erik Lamela this summer, as the Argentinian is set to earn a second chance to prove he is no White Hart Lane flop.

The Nerazzurri were hoping to lure the Argentinian winger back to Serie A after Lamela's dismal first season in the Premier League.

The 22-year-old, who moved to the London outfit on a club-record Â£30m transfer deal from Roma last summer, made just nine league appearances for Spurs in the 2013-14 campaign.

Getting ready: Erik Lamela took to Twitter to show off his pre-season preparations

'Lamela is a
 dream that we haven't been given a chance to realise,' Inter sporting 
director Piero Ausilio said to Gazzetta dello Sport.

'Simply because Tottenham don't want to put him in the market.'

Lamela tweeted a picture of himself training in the gym ahead of his return to Tottenham's pre-season traininmg next week.

He tweeted: 'I'm really looking forward to this season, come on you spurs!!'

New
 Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino will be hoping to get the former Roma 
forward back on track this season after injuries plagued his debut 
season in England.

Pochettino
 left Southampton to sign a five-year contract with Spurs in the summer 
as the club decided not to continue with Tim Sherwood as their manager.

Inter
 chief Ausilio, meanwhile, also revealed that Inter have rejected 
tempting offers from several clubs for their Croatian midfielder Mateo 
Kovacic.

The 20-year-old is a reported target of top European clubs, including Real Madrid, Manchester United and Liverpool.

When asked if Kovacic is not for sale, Ausilio said: 'Absolutely. In fact we have turned down various offers from big clubs.'

Ausilio also said Inter's talks with Porto to acquire Portuguese central defender Rolando have reached an impasse.

'The negotiations are at a standstill,' he said.

'We
 easily reached an agreement with the player and made an offer to Porto 
that we considered fair for a defender who is 28 and whose contract will
 soon expire.

'We simply don't want to go over that figure.'
