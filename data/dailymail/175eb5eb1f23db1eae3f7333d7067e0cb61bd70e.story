This isn't a job for the feint hearted - cutting branches while balancing 100ft in the air on a swaying tree trunk.

Thankfully, there wasn't a strong wind blowing when this tree surgeon took his razor-sharp chainsaw to this eucalyptus tree in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex.

Slowly, branch by branch, he gave the 35-year-old tree a good haircut, some might call it an old-fashioned short, back and sides.

Success: Another branch gone... slowly but surely the tree surgeon makes headway

Eucalyptus trees, like the one pictured here, are evergreen and are grown mainly for their foliage and peeling bark.

They're famous - or infamous - for their rapid growth and can quickly become unmanageable if left unpruned.

But they do have desirable traits, such as being a good source of wood, producing oil that can be used for cleaning and as a natural insecticide.

What branch is next? It must be tiring work all this pruning, but then it was a big tree

They've even been used to drain swamps and thereby reduce the risk of malaria in some countries, although some plant lovers have criticised them for being 'invasive water-suckers'.

This particular eucalyptus however has had its day.

After the severe haircut, the tree surgeon turned his lethal chainsaw on the trunk, slowly chopping it down.

After several hours of chopping and pruning the once mighty 100ft tree was no more than a stump.

Almost all gone: Just half the trunk remaining before this tree ends up as a stump
