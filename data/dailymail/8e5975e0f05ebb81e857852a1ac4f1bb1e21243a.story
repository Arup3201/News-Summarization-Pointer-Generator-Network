It went from one of the world's most exclusive gentlemen's clubs to London's grandest wreck in the space of just 100 years.

But now Cambridge House is set to be returned to its former glory and become Britain's most expensive home, with a jaw-dropping price tag of more than £200million.

Billionaire property tycoon brothers David and Simon Reuben want to throw money at transforming the former In and Out Club on Piccadilly in central London into a palatial 48-room residence.

They bought the crumbling grade I listed mansion, opposite Green Park, last year for £130million and have now submitted plans to Westminster City Council.

Development: The billionaire Reuben brothers have announced plans to transform Cambridge House into something worth in excess of £200 million

Plans: The once palatial In and Out Club on Piccadilly fell into ruin but will be turned into Britain's most expensive home

Designed by architect Paul Davis + Partners, it would boast an underground swimming pool, gym and 35,000-bottle wine cellar.

Experts are predicting it could fetch £214million, £74million more than Russian billionaire Andrey Borodin paid for Park Place near Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire - currently Britain’s most expensive pad.

Trevor Abrahmsohn, who runs Glentree Estates, which regularly sells properties on this 
scale, described the home as a 'great opportunity' for a wealthy 
foreigner to buy a piece of English heritage.

But the estate agent added it is unlikely anyone will know when the completed home changes hands.

He said: 'It would make a wonderful home and be one of the largest private residences in the UK.

Beautiful: The Grade I listed building was designed by Matthew Brettingham for Charles Wyndham, 2nd Earl of Egremont in the 1750s and was one of London's most impressive structures

'No one has got much more than £120 million for a home in London but that is not to say it wouldn’t happen.

'This is a unique property and a great opportunity for a very wealthy person who wants a landmark home in London.

'For them, it is about buying a piece of English heritage but you won’t know when it is has been sold.

'Properties like this will be sold through the grey market - when no information is made public.'

Cambridge House or No. 94 Piccadilly was London's most exclusive property when it was built more than 250 years ago.

The grade I listed mansion on the northern side of Piccadilly was built for Charles Wyndham, 2nd Earl of Egremont, by architect Matthew Brettingham.

It changed hands several times until 1829  when it was bought by Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, when it took the name Cambridge House, which has stuck ever since.

Thirty-one years later prime minister Lord Palmerston bought it and lived there for 20 years until he died in 1865. His body was even taken from there to Westminster Abbey for his funeral.

It was then bought by the Naval and Military Club and became known as the 'In and Out Club' because of the iconic signs on its gate posts, which still remain today.

For more than a century it stayed as the exclusive private members club until it moved, and Cambridge House was bought as a development opportunity but the project went bust and the property fell into ruin.

It has now been empty ever since 1999 but this new project by the Reubens, who bought it last year, could now restore it to its former glory.

The premises started life as a villa designed by Matthew Brettingham for the Second Earl of Egremont in the 1750s.

It was adopted by the Naval and Military club, which became fondly known as the In and Out Club due to the prominent signs on the entrance and exit gates, in the 1870s.

Members continued to meet there until 1999 when the club moved to its current home at No.4 St James’s Square.

Earlier this year, royal patron the Duke of Edinburgh Prince Philip joined other bowler-hat clad members there to celebrate the institution’s 150th anniversary.

Originally established in 1862 because all other service clubs had reached their full membership quotas, it was initially only open to military officers.

This is no longer the case, however, and now both women and men who have not served in the Armed Forces can join.

Famous past members include British army officer Lawrence of Arabia, James Bond author Ian Fleming and poet Rudyard Kipling.

Naval officer Robert Falcon Scott, who led two expeditions to the Antarctic, also frequented the club.

The Reuben brothers were ranked second in this year’s Forbes magazine List of Billionaires with an estimated fortune of £6billion.

After making their money in Russian aluminium, they branched into the London real estate market.

Their portfolio includes the Millbank Tower, the John Lewis headquarters in Victoria, Carlton House in SW1, Connaught House on Berkeley Square and prime Sloane Street shops.

They have also been involved in the regeneration of the Paddington area through the Merchant Square scheme and are in the process of creating a 340,000 square foot mixed-use development on Albert Embankment.

At Piccadilly, they also have plans for the house next door to the former In and Out Club – No.95 previously the American Club – and for six luxury flats on another part of the site.
