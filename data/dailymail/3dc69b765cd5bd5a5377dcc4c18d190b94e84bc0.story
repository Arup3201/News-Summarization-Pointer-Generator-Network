Juventus have made an enquiry about the availability of Javier Hernandez after Arsenal stalled on the proposed loan of Lukas Podolski to the Italian giants.

Louis van Gaal looks prepared to let the Mexico striker leave Manchester United with Angel di Maria on the verge of completing a £59.7million transfer from Real Madrid and the likes of Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie remaining the Dutchman's clear first-choice strikers.

And with a top-quality defensive midfielder still desperately needed at Old Trafford, Van Gaal could yet use Juve's interest in Hernandez as bait in a move for Arturo Vidal.

Podolski looked set for a move to Turin but Olivier Giroud is now facing up to the prospect of three months out with a broken foot, meaning Arsene Wenger's forward resources have been stretched to their limits.

Theo Walcott and Yaya Sanogo are also injured, leaving Alexis Sanchez as the Gunners' only option up front - but the Chile star has struggled in the 'false nine' role in Arsenal's opening few games of the season.

Podolski's agent told German publication Die Welt: 'Lukas is fighting his way back into the squad after a tiring World Cup. He feels good here, and has a contract until 2016. But things can happen quickly in football.'

Hernandez is set to start Tuesday night's Capital One Cup second round clash at MK Dons along with Danny Welbeck, another United striker whose future is uncertain.

Van Gaal looks ready to let the England forward quit the club in search of a more regular starting spot elsewhere.

But competition for Welbeck's signature will be fierce with Arsenal, Tottenham, Everton, Newcastle, Sunderland, Hull and Turkish club Galatasaray all interested.
