Italy's Daniele Meucci won the European Championship marathon title on Sunday ahead of Yared Shegumo of Poland and Aleksey Reunkov of Russia.

Poland's Marcin Chabowski, who led for most of the race, slumped in the final stages and abandoned shortly before the finish.

Winner: Daniele Meucci wins European Championships marathon in Zurich

In only the third marathon of his career, 28-year-old Meucci finished in 2 hours, 11 minutes, 8 seconds for a margin of 52 seconds over Shegumo and 1:07 over Reunkov.

Meucci already won silver and bronze over 10,000 in the last two European championships.

On the closing day with a dozen finals on the program, Dafne Schippers is going for a sprint triple with the Dutch 4x100 relay team and Mo Farah of Britain is seeking a long-distance double in the 5,000.

Farah admitted yesterday that although he is back to winning ways, he still feels vulnerable at times after collapsing at the New York marathon earlier this year. 

New: It was only the third marathon of Meucci's career, he had previously specialised in 10,000m

Podium: Poland's Yared Shegumo came second and Russia's Aleksey Reunkov third
