Inquiry: UKIP MEP for the North West Paul Nuttall wants an investigation into two Merseyside NHS Trusts

An MEP has demanded an inquiry into claims two Merseyside hospitals passed on confidential patient medical records to ambulance chasing lawyers.

Paul Nuttall, UKIP MEP for the North West, said he had heard complaints from constituents bombarded with messages from personal injury law firms after hospital treatment.

The claims have emerged as insurance company AXA UK announced it would no longer accept referral fees from law firms and called for reform to whiplash damages.

'AXA hopes this action is a first step in a journey to reform the emerging compensation culture which is spiralling out of control and encourages Government to ban referral fees completely,' the company said in a statement.

The developments come the day after the Daily Mail revealed that police are raking in millions of pounds from selling on the  details of drivers who have had a road accident.

A Mail investigation found that police officers are often the first link in a chain of tip offs and kick backs as police, insurance companies, unscrupulous lawyers and breakdown firms conspire to exploit powerless motorists.

UKIP MEP Mr Nuttall demanded an inquiry into the Wirral and Royal Liverpool Hospital NHS Trusts after he was approached by constituents who feared their confidentiality had been breached in the same way.

'The only way the claims firms can have got the information that they had been a patient and also got their mobile phone numbers is from the hospital itself,' he said.

'I don't know if that is being done with the connivance of the hospital trusts concerned - Wirral and the Royal Liverpool Hospital - or whether some staff are doing this off their own bat.

'But I want to know and this must be stopped. I know that hospital trusts everywhere are having to make budget cuts but if they are selling this highly private information to boost their coffers it is an outrage and must contravene the Data Protection Act.'

AXA's announcement over payments from personal injury lawyers came as anger over the effect the UK's growing 'compensation culture' has had on car insurance premiums bubbled over today.

The insurer, one of the world's largest, singled out the problem of compensation for whiplash injuries - which are almost undetectable.

In particular, they highlighted the unscrupulous practice of motorists being encouraged to make claims several years after an accident.

After such a long time has passed it is almost impossible to verify what injury has been sustained, particularly when no injury was claimed at the time.

Paul Evans, Group CEO, AXA UK, said: 'As one of the leading insurance providers, we have decided that the only way to address the problem adequately is to lead by example.

'Over the last few years we have seen an exponential rise in personal injury claims – especially soft tissue injuries – whilst evidence suggests road accidents are decreasing.

'We have also seen a significant rise in claims made some years after the event which are therefore impossible to prove or to defend.'

'Racket': Police are raking in millions of pounds from cynically selling on the details of drivers who have had a road accident (file photograph)

Yesterday the Daily Mail revealed 
police forces were running a 'huge racket' in which they cynically sell 
on the  details of drivers who have had a road accident.

Officers
tip off preferred local garages and breakdown firms - who come to 
collect the car, then hit motorists with removal and storage charges.

For this service, the police demand a so-called 'administration fee' of up to £25 per vehicle.

Details of this and other dubious practices emerged amid a blazing row over the way police, insurance companies, unscrupulous lawyers and breakdown firms conspire to exploit powerless motorists.

Insurers blame unnecessary police charges and the compensation culture - which has seen damages claims for trivial or imagined injuries spiral - for the soaring increases in the annual premiums they charge all drivers.

But they too stand accused of being deeply involved in the racket.

According to ex-Justice Secretary Jack Straw, insurance companies are selling details of their own clients to 'no-win, no-fee lawyers' for up to £1,000 per person.

These 'claims managers' then bombard the motorist with unwanted texts and phone calls offering to help them to pursue compensation claims for often non-existent injuries.

Some 80 per cent of all claims are for 'whiplash' which is conveniently undetectable by scans or X-rays. 

The cost of settling the spiralling 
bill for personal injury claims is immediately passed on to the driver 
in higher premiums - while insurers are allowed to keep their lucrative 
'referral' fee.

Mr 
Straw said yesterday that the entire system had become a 'huge racket' 
and that the insurance industry saw it as 'our dirty little secret'.

He added: 'The garages, the recovery firms - even the police are selling on this information.'

The
Information Commissioner receives 100 complaints every month from 
motorists bombarded with phone calls and texts urging them to claim 
compensation.

Christopher Graham has begun an investigation into whether the tactic is a breach of data protection laws.

Insurers
are expected to defend themselves by pointing out that, on insurance 
renewal forms, they warn that a client's personal information could be 
passed on to  'relevant third parties'.

Mr Graham wants to establish if this could reasonably be understood to mean claims handling companies.

If he decides it does not, insurers could be found in breach of the Data Protection Act.

The
police tactic of obtaining referral fees from local garages is legal 
because they insist that the information goes no further.

Garages are told they will be in breach of the Act if they contact any third party.

The police's role was revealed in evidence to the Transport Select Committee, obtained by Mr Straw.

It shows that, when a car cannot be 
driven away from the scene of an accident, police who arrive quickly 
make a call to a local garage or breakdown company.

Forces, who have agreed a fee in advance, then receive a 'tip off' or 'referral fee ranging from £5-£25.

In one year, West Midlands Police 
raked in an estimated £622,275 from contractors' tip-off payments, in 
relation to 24,891 vehicles.

Greater Manchester Police' referred' 
32,855 cars to breakdown companies in 2009, but refused to reveal the 
amount it received, claiming disclosure could 'damage the commercial 
interest of third parties'.

Police claim the money is necessary to cover 'admin' fees - but not all forces choose to charge a fee.

The evidence was compiled by the insurer swiftcover.com, using Freedom of Information requests.

It approached nine forces - only two 
of which said they did not charge a 'referral' fee for arranging the 
collection of cars involved in an accident or unfit to drive after 
breaking down.

Based on these figures, more than 
three-quarters of the 54 forces in England, Scotland and Wales are 
likely to be pocketing a fee. The value to the police could be tens of 
millions of pounds.

In evidence to MPs, swiftcover said: 
'When the insurer is told about the collection, it has to arrange a 
further collection of the vehicle from a recovery centre, owned by a 
third party.

'This incurs additional, unnecessary costs to the insurer and therefore policyholders.'

They say drivers should themselves call the insurance company, to avoid police getting in first.

Police say they ensure the garages agree not to pass on the details of motorists to other companies.

But claims managers say there is evidence of garages ignoring these rules, despite it being a breach of data protection law.

Incredibly, the tactics being used by the insurers themselves are legal.

Buried away in the small-print of insurance documents, motorists are 
asked to agree for their details to be passed on to 'relevant third 
parties'.

Insurers have taken this to be a 
green-light for them to sell the names and other personal information of
a crash victims to a claims manager for £200-£1,000.

Claims firms then encourage crash 
victims to make compensation bids for injuries such as whiplash, even 
when they have not been hurt, according to the investigation by Mr 
Straw.

The motorist can receive a pay-out of thousands of pounds - but premiums are driven up.

Research: MP Jack Straw found insurance companies selling details

In 2009, the number of road accidents involving personal injury was 31 per cent down on the average for 1994-98.

But the cost of personal injury 
claims has doubled in ten years - from £7billion to £14billion - and 
motor insurance premiums have shot up, by at least 30 per cent in the 
last year.

Mr Straw wants the 'referral' fees 
banned. He says insurers have admitted to him that the fact they are 
charging 'referrals' is the industry's 'dirty secret'.

But yesterday insurers remained 
defiant - saying they will carry-on selling drivers' personal data until
such time as a ban is imposed.

The Association of British Insurers 
Nick Starling, said: 'If they [insurers] stopped taking this money, 
everyone else would be taking it - which is why they have to be banned 
outright.'

Nicholas Jervis, of solicitors 
LoyaltyLaw.com, said: 'Finally someone has realised it is the insurance 
industry who have been screwing the system more than anyone else.'

The Association of Chief Police 
Officers said it was down to individual forces to decide how much they 
charged, but they were doing nothing wrong.

But Andrew Wigmore, spokesman for the
Claims Council - a trade body representing 120 claims management firms -
said: 'We are aware police officers, nurses, doctors, ambulance men and
women have sold details of accident victims to claims management 
companies.'

ACPO insisted: 'We do not sell the details of people involved in accidents to compensation lawyers.'
