Pompous: Former president Nicholas Sarkozy said he may be forced to return to government because of a sense of duty 'for France'

Nicholas Sarkozy styled himself as a Charles de Gaulle figure today - saying he may be forced to return to government because of a sense of duty 'for France'.

In one of the most high-minded interviews of his career, the 58-year-old former President said he does not want to return to politics, but 'may be obliged to' because of the failure of the Socialist government which replaced his.

Mr Sarkozy, who has been out of power since May last year, told the current affairs magazine Valeurs Actuelles: 'There may unfortunately be a moment when the question is no longer "Do you feel like it?" but "Have you got a choice?"

'In this this case I can no longer tell myself: "I am happy, I take my daughter to school, and I take part in conferences around the world".

'In which case, certainly, I will be forced to return. Not because I feel like it. Because of duty. Solely because it is France.'

Mr Sarkozy, a right wing conservative, has often tried to evoke the spirit of General De Gaulle, the legendary Second World War leader who went on to lead France right up until the late 1960s.

De Gaulle was consumed by a sense of duty for his homeland, regularly sacrificing personal ambitions for the good of his nation.

But the diminutive Mr Sarkozy, 5ft 5ins, has never been viewed with anything like the same reverence as De Gaulle, a towering figure of 6ft 4ins who dominated post-war Europe.

Not only is Mr Sarkozy facing a number of corruption enquiries which could eventually see him jailed, but he is deeply unpopular among huge sections of French society.

Mr Sarkozy and his third wife, the 
former supermodel Carla Bruni, currently live in central Paris with 
their daughter Giulia, 17 months.

This has made his claim that he now takes 'my daughter to school' sound an unlikely one.

The Sarkozy's home was raided by anti-corruption police last year in connection with the so-called Bettencourt Affair.

This has seen key Sarkozy lieutenants accused of accepting envelopes full of cash from Liliane Bettencourt, the I'Oreal heiress and France's richest women, in return for future tax breaks.

Mr Sarkozy has denied any wrong doing, but has been made a 'material witness' in a criminal enquiry into the scandal.

Other accusations include claims that he accepted millions of pounds worth of illegal cash from former Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi.

Mr Sarkozy lost his presidential immunity from prosecution when beaten by Socialist Francois Hollande in elections last May.

Mr Hollande is himself now a deeply unpopular president, and is being held responsible for the economic recession blighting the country.
