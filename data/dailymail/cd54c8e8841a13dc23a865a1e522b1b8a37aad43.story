Robert Wilson was left badly injured after the accident

A scout leader who broke his back sliding down a fireman's pole in front of his troop has been awarded almost £170,000 compensation by a High Court judge.

Robert Wilson, 49, fractured a vertebrae when he 'landed on his bottom' after careering down a 10-foot pole at Clyne Farm Centre's assault course, in Mayals, near Swansea, in August 2009.

He was taken to hospital by helicopter after the accident on the Burma Bridge obstacle at the Challenge Valley course.

Despite major surgery, his work as a taxi driver and as a carer for his seriously disabled wife have been seriously curbed by his devastating injury.

Mr Wilson, of Whitehill, near Bordon, Hampshire - who described himself as a 'fat taxi driver', unfit and weighing in at 13-and-a-half stone - said he had been worried about the pole descent but relied on a 'highly confident' instructor who reassured him.

Mrs Justice Swift rejected claims that Mr Wilson was the 'author of his own misfortune' and described as 'entirely fanciful' claims that he had released his handhold on the pole whilst showing off in front of his troop.

She found that the 24-year-old instructor had failed to demonstrate how to safely descend the pole in the wet conditions or to instruct Mr Wilson in the correct technique before he hit the deck and immediately experienced agony.

More than 300,000 are estimated to have used the assault course at Clyne Farm Centre in Mayals, near Swansea

Mr Wilson earlier said the instructor told him: 'Just go out and give the pole a big hug, hug it tight.'

The activity area of Clyne Farm Centre was designed with help of an army instructor

He added: 'I then said that I wasn't 
very fit, that I was a fat taxi driver at 13-and-a-half stone, and are 
you sure about this? She said to just give it a big hug.'

Describing Mr Wilson as a 'thoroughly genuine and honest individual' who had done his best to give an accurate account of events leading up to the accident, the judge said of the instructor, by contrast, 'I did not find her an impressive witness'.

Geoff Haden, trading as Clyne Farm Centre, was ordered to pay Mr Wilson, £167,514 damages, including £25,000 for Mr Wilson's 'pain, suffering and loss of amenity' and additional sums for his lost earnings and the extra assistance he will need due to his permanent injury.

The judge said she had no doubt that Mr Wilson 'is a genuine hard-working man' who had devoted himself to the care of his wife, who was confined to a wheelchair by a childhood condition, and their four-year-old son.

Lawyers for Mr Haden, a chartered structural engineer, had told the court that he had devised the assault course with the help of an army instructor and that, since it opened more than 20 years ago, it had been used by 300,000 people, half of them children, without any similar accidents having occurred.
