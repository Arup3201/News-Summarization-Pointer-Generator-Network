They were expecting an emotional reunion at the airport with their daughter who's been working abroad for eight months.

But instead, after 20 hours travelling, Andrew and Julie Kelham landed 1,500 miles away.

The couple had booked a £3,200 trip to visit their daughter Frankie, 21,  in San Jose, Mexico. Where they ended up was San Jose, California.

After 20 hours travelling, they landed 1,500 miles away and were forced to pay another £800 to fly to the right city, where they eventually met Frankie, centre

It turned out travel firm Thomas Cook had sent them to the wrong city.

Mr and Mrs Kelham only realised when their daughter rang them when they couldn't find her at arrivals.

Support worker Mrs Kelham, 51, told The Sun: 'She was crying her eyes out. We couldn't take it in.

The couple had booked a 14-day trip at the travel agents in Harrogate, North Yorkshire.

The wrong city: San Jose in California - 1,500 miles from San Jose in Mexico

Fifteen hundred miles and one national border separate San Jose in Mexico, from San Jose in California, where the Kelhams ended up

The city of San José del Cabo is the seat of the municipality of Los Cabos at the south end of the Baja California peninsula.

In the 2010 census, it had a population of 69,788 and is a major tourist destination for travellers, with more than 900,000 hotel guests in 2011.

The Mission San José del Cabo was founded in 1730; the nearby Río San José was useful to the Spanish as a source of fresh water for galleons traveling to and from the Philippines.

The other San Jose, set in California's Silicon Valley, is the third largest city in the state. It was founded in 1777, as El Pueblo de San José de Guadalupe, the first civilian town in the Spanish colony of Nueva California.

By the 1990s, San Jose's location within the booming local technology industry earned the city the nickname 'Capital of Silicon Valley'.

Among the tech giants that have their headquarters there are nternet firm eBay.

They were booked into the Royal Solaris Hotel in San Jose Los Cabos, in the Mexican peninsula of Baja California Sur.

And their first flight was also correct, from Manchester to Chicago.

But a connecting flight took them to the wrong San Jose - the one in California, not Baja California Sur.

The pair had to spend a night sleeping on airport chairs and pay £800 to fly to Mexico the next day.

Mr Kelham, 50, said: 'It was a nightmare. We missed two days with our daughter.'

Thomas Cook initially offered an £800 refund and a £100 goodwill voucher, which was increased to £1,400.

A spokeswoman for the agents booking arm Netflights said: 'We know how important holidays are for our customers and strive to meet and often exceed their expectations.

'The type of incident experienced by Mr and Mrs Kelham is extremely rare, and we would like to again apologise to the couple for any inconvenience caused.

'We've spoken to the couple since their return and have since resolved this matter to their satisfaction.'
