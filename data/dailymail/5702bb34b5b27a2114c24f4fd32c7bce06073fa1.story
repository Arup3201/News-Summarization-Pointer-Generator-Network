David Nugent described Everton's late equaliser as 'a killer' after Leicester were denied a crucial win in their battle against relegation from the Barclays Premier League.

The Foxes looked set for an unlikely three points at Goodison Park after goals from Nugent and Esteban Cambiasso cancelled out Steven Naismith's opener.

But, with two minutes of normal time remaining, Romelu Lukaku's diving header was diverted into his own net by Matthew Upson and the game ended 2-2.

Nugent, a boyhood Everton fan, said on Sky Sports: 'Nobody expected us to come away from home and pick up points. To concede like that is a killer but it's a point on the board.

'I always dreamt of scoring at Goodison Park. Thankfully it got the team back into the game.

'Now we've got a tricky game at Manchester City (on Wednesday) but Burnley went there and got a result so there's no reason we can't.'

Cambiasso has been more used to fighting for titles in an illustrious career but the midfielder feels his side can get out of trouble if they continue to show the same battling qualities.

The Argentinian said: 'If we work hard in this situation, I think we can stay in the Premier League.

'It's a hard fight but I think this time we understand what is important. It's a great fight to the end. We need to play like today and I think we have possibilities.'

But Nugent was eventually left to bemoan the result after his side dropped points late on

Everton boss Roberto Martinez admitted his side did not play well three days after impressing in the Europa League against Young Boys but was happy with their response after going behind.

He told Sky Sports: 'It's one of those performances that comes from playing in Europe. We looked a little pedestrian.

'We knew it was going to be a difficult game. Scoring the first goal is always the hardest moment. Once we achieved that, we didn't control the play as well as we should have done.

'I don't think we defended the box well. The two goals were soft. When things are not going your way you create chances but can't convert them.

'But it's a fantastic sign to show the character we did to at least get a point out of the game.'

Everton's fans have not been slow to show their frustration at their side's struggles at Goodison Park this season, and it was no different on Sunday.

Martinez added: 'We showed a little bit the responsibility we carry when we play football at Goodison. At times we can't really enjoy our role of trying to break teams down. The frustration shows through. It's something we need to get used to.'

Leicester manager Nigel Pearson felt his team did not get what they deserved but remains confident that will change.

He said: 'It feels a bit like a defeat at the moment but I suppose we have to take the positives out of it.

'I think we played well. We've frustrated Everton and their fans to a certain extent and responded well to going behind.

'It's another one of those scratch-your-head days. At some point we will change our fortunes. We can only do that by continuing to apply ourselves in the way we have today.

'It's not a case of feeling unlucky, we have to turn things around ourselves."

Pearson, meanwhile, shrugged off reports his position is again under threat a fortnight after he was reported to have been sacked.

The Leicester boss said: 'I always do my job as conscientiously as I can and I will continue to do that until I'm told otherwise. I'm committed to the job and that's all you need to know.'
