A BBC website which offers 'in depth analysis' and research is available to everyone in the world - except British licence fee payers.

The BBC Future site was launched in February 2012 and is heralded as the new international technology, science, environment and health site from the British Broadcasting Corporation.

But if anyone in the UK is tempted to read stories 'drawing on the BBC's global expertise and storytelling' they had better think again.

What we are missing out on: BBC Future, a global site including in depth analysis and research

Sorry: If you try to click on any of the stories from the site you are greeted with this message from the BBC

The site is not accessible from the 
UK as it is part of the corporation's international service and is not 
funded by the licence fee.

This means, that despite Britons forking out almost £150 a year for a TV licence to fund the BBC, they are excluded from the content.

And without the funding from the controversial licence fee - the BBC would not exist.

Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, told MailOnline: 'BBC Worldwide is only able to function because it is selling to other countries the programmes which were made using licence fee payers’ cash in the first place.

'Those in Britain unable to access these services available to the rest of the world have every right to feel cheated.'

But BBC Worldwide say it is the same 'genre' of content already provided for UK citizens - though the stories are not the same.

And that it is a 'wholly owned subsidiary' existing to 'maximise the value of BBC content and key brands through exploiting them overseas'.

A spokesman said BBC Worldwide 'acquires content at market value, which is the same price for both BBC Worldwide or any other parties'.

BBC Future is described as a site 
that 'explores the global ideas and innovations that are shaping our 
lives and the world around us - now and in the future.'

It provides 'in depth analysis of cutting edge research', according to the site's Facebook group.

As well as BBC Future there is also BBC Travel, which is another international section not available to those in the UK.

If licence fee payers in the UK try to click on stories 
provided by these sites then they are directed to a message which says, 
'We're sorry but this site is not accessible from the UK.'

The compulsory licence fee has 
sparked furore in the past as the BBC has been outbid for rights to 
screen sporting events such as the Grand National.

Critics have asked why the 
corporation should be entitled to ‘special treatment’ if it fails in its
duty to rise above commercial and rating considerations.

Complaints have also been raised over
the corporation’s coverage, its repetition of programmes and whether taxpayers in the UK should get 
more for the money they pay.

A wealth of content: From music, maths to crime and HIV, everyone outside the UK can access it

Columns: Those abroad can take a dive into the big stories in science, technology and health

The Future site offers exclusive content to those who are not paying the licence fee in the UK.

Stories on the site can range from anything maths, music or engineering to drugs, medicine and genetics.

Each week the site has a global 
thinker from the world of philosophy, science, psychology or the arts 
and puts forward a radical, inspiring or 
controversial idea that they believe will change the world - according 
to the website.

And the service's defence writer goes behind closed doors and writes about the future of national security.

A
recent story includes an exclusive look inside a high-priority US 
military project. The project's mission is to detect and neutralise 
roadside bombs.

And 
another is a feature on a man who lives in the coldest, remotest part of 
the world, a story that is linked from the BBC Future Facebook website.

While
UK citizens can choose to 'like' and follow the content, once they try 
to click on any of the stories, they are told they cannot access it.

A BBC Worldwide spokesman said: 'BBC 
Future focuses on the latest trends across Science, Technology, Health 
and Environment genres. 

'It has been created for the BBC’s commercial website bbc.com for audiences outside the UK.

'Under the BBC’s Fair Trading rules 
commercial websites are not allowed to receive unfair promotion from the
BBC’s public services. 

'This prevents us from being able to provide 
Future content on BBC.co.uk.

'It
has been developed using commercial revenues, and not the licence fee. 
The profit from such activity goes back to the public service arm of the
BBC to fund the development of new content.

'BBC.co.uk also offers users a host of interesting and thought provoking
content across Science, Technology, Environment and Health in 
individual sections.'

BBC.com was launched in 2007 to offer
audiences outside the UK an international version of the BBC's online 
site.

BBC Worldwide is a commercial arm of the corporation and a 
wholly-owned subsidiary.

It aims to maximize profits for the corporation with the aid of advertising.

In 2011/12 the company's total returns to the BBC rose by 19 per cent 
to £216m, taking the returns to over £1.3billlion since 2004.
