More than 1,100 American cities have recorded their coldest-ever July temperatures as an unseasonable chill settles across a swath of the U.S.

As temperatures struggled to get above 50F in many places, it was hard to remember the heatwave that gripped many parts of the U.S. in mid-July.

From July 23, new records for poor temperatures were set in 1,122 places, with Salt Lake in Oregon recording only 30F on Monday - its coldest day on that date since 1976, according to Climate Depot.

It was quite a change from the recent heat, when the temperature in Manhattan's Central Park topped 90F for six straight days, inching down only to 89F by 11pm on the Friday.

Even Arizona, which has been suffering from devastating wildfires amid the heatwave, recorded some cooler weather.

In Castle Hot Springs, a low of 61F was recorded on Saturday. The city, which on average would experience a low of 75F in July, last had a temperature that low in 1883, when the mercury struggled to rise over 62.1F.

For residents in Nebraska, it was cold comfort that the last time they experienced such unseasonable temperatures was in 1862.

Two cities broke their previous records, with Fairbury recording 48F and David City recording 48.9F on Monday.

On the same day, Oolitic Purdue in Indiana, also broke its 1862 record, with a temperature of 48.9F.

Most of the record-breaking chills were recorded over the weekend and Monday, with the start of a cold snap that is expected to last for two weeks.

'The quick change of air mass to cool Canadian air is unusual in that the northwest flow is also going to last a week or two,' Bill Karins, a meteorologist for NBC News, said. 'Typically a cool spell in the summer would last one or two days.'
