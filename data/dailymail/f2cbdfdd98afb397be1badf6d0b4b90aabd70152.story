A broken down bus carrying around 50 people was hit by a lorry on a busy road this morning, sparking a major emergency operation.

Three people were injured in the smash, including one seriously, which happened at around 12.30am today.

The bus, which had broken down on the side of the A34 at Drayton, Oxfordshire, was a rail replacement service carrying passengers from Oxford to Didcot.

South Coast Ambulance Service said five people were taken to the John Radcliffe Hospital.

Horrific: One person is in a life-threatening condition after a lorry was involved in a collision with a rail replacement bus that had broken down at the side of the the A34 at Drayton, Oxfordshire

Pictures from the scene appeared to show that the lorry involved in the crash was a DHL vehicle. The company has yet to comment on the incident

One patient is in a life-threatening condition, another two have serious injuries and two have minor injuries.

A passenger has spoken of the terrifying moment the vehicle was shunted off the road.

Adam Graves said smokers who were stood outside the stricken bus appeared to have been clipped by the vehicle as it was thrown forward and down an embankment by a lorry operated by the DHL delivery firm.

Another man who was sitting at the back of the bus, where the lorry hit, had to be pulled free from his seat after becoming trapped.

Mr Graves said many people fled the vehicle through a smashed window as the smell of petrol sparked fears of an explosion.

Three people were rushed from the scene to hospital, one in a serious condition, while others were treated at the roadside and at a nearby police station for minor injuries.

The rail replacement bus service was carrying around 50 people from Oxford to Didcot when it broke down on the southbound carriageway of the A34 near Drayton, Oxon., at around 12.30am today/yesterday (Mon).

Many of the people on the bus had been at a Taking Back Sunday concert at Oxford's O2 Academy last/on Sunday night, according to Mr Graves.

The 21-year-old NHS contractor said there were chaotic scenes after the bus was hit.

'The bus driver said there was a loss of power and we pulled over to the side,' said Mr Graves, who was travelling with friends.

'I was on my phone and suddenly the bus moved forward, like it had been jump-started. There was quite a loud bang.

'All of a sudden it was turning round and I was falling out of my seat.

'People started screaming. I don't think many people were wearing their seatbelts so they were flying around and hitting their heads.'

Mr Graves, who escaped with cuts and bruises, said the front door of the coach was up in the air after the vehicle went onto its side and there was a broken window which some people climbed out of.

'There was one guy who was trapped in his seat,' said Mr Graves, from Didcot.

'I think he had broken his legs. He was sat right at the back where the lorry hit.

'There was a couple of us who helped to pull him out. One guy was breaking the seat so he could get free.'

Mr Graves said moments before the stricken bus was hit a group of people got off to have a cigarette.

'They thought we were going to be there a while so a few got off to smoke and then maybe 30 seconds later the crash happened,' he said.

'I think at least one of them got clipped by the bus and was badly hurt. The rest were in shock.

'There were a couple of people with quite a bit of blood on their faces and cuts. It was a very crazy scene.'

Passengers who did not need hospital treatment were taken to Abingdon police station. 

The three people injured during the crash were all passengers on the rail replacement service but police were yet to confirm the age or sex of those hurt. Their next of kin had been informed of the incident. 

Pictures from the scene appeared to show that the lorry involved in the crash was a DHL vehicle. 

A spokesperson for the delivery and logistics company said: 'We can confirm that one of our vehicles was involved in a serious road traffic incident on the A34 this morning between the Botley and Milton interchanges.

'We are cooperating fully with the police in their enquiries. While these are underway we are unable to comment further except to say the safety of the public and our drivers remains paramount to us.'

Thames Valley Police said the driver of the lorry, who was uninjured, had been spoken to and that no arrests had been made in connection with the collision.

Fire and ambulance crews also attended the scene and Abingdon police station, where passengers were taken following the crash, was being used as a triage centre by South Central Ambulance Service.

Police said officers had been taking statements from passengers at the station and that many had now been able to go home. 

The southbound carriageway was expected to remain closed until at least 10am today as clean up operations and collision investigations continued at the scene.

A Thames Valley Police spokesman said: 'The A34 southbound is still closed between Botley and Milton interchanges as Thames Valley Police and partner agencies continue to clear the carriageway following the earlier road traffic collision.

'Thames Valley Police is working on recovering the vehicles involved in the collision which took place at 12.30am this morning.

'After the recovery process is complete, the Highways Agency will deploy its carriageway maintenance vehicles to sweep and grit the carriageway when the scene is handed over to them.

'It is essential up to this time that users of the A34 southbound continue to use the black triangle in yellow box diversion route and listen to local media for news regarding opening up times.

'The next of kin of the three people injured in the collision have all been informed of the incident.'

The crash was causing long delays for commuters on the A34, with many taking to Twitter in despair at the disruption.

One driver said it took him 70 minutes to do an 18-mile commute while another, Nathan, tweeted: 'Parked with engine off... Gotta love the A34.' He later added: 'Not moving again! Could be further behind I suppose...Looking for a positive.' 

The bus was a replacement for the 00.05am First Great Western service from Oxford to Didcot.
