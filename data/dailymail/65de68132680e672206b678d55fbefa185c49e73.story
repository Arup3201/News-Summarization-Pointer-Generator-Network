Rob Ford's sister revealed to police the Toronto mayor smoked crack cocaine with her one night in April, according court documents that indicated the cancer-stricken politician is now being investigated for drug possession. 

The documents released Wednesday said Kathy Ford was twice interviewed by investigators after reports surfaced last May of a video allegedly showing the mayor smoking crack in his sister's basement during a party. 

Reports of that video prompted Ford to enter rehabilitation for two months, capping a year of scandals that began when news stories surfaced of a first recording apparently showing the mayor smoking crack.

Incriminating photo: A still image from a video surreptitiously shot by a drug dealer on April 26 and obtained by The Globe and Mail showing Toronto Mayor Rob Ford holding what appears to be a crack pipe

Ford, who has doggedly refused to resign amid the mounting controversies, dropped his re-election bid earlier this month after being diagnosed with a rare and tough to treat form of abdominal cancer.

His brother, Doug Ford, is running in his place against two major opponents in the October 27 election.

Police said they believe the latest video was recorded on April 26 by Michael 'Jugga' James, whom Kathy Ford said sold drugs to her and her brother that night. She also said Ford was drinking with his friend, Alexander Lisi, who is facing drug and extortion charges.

The documents, released by Ontario Superior Court Justice Ian Nordheimer, were filed by police trying to obtain a search warrant for three of James' cellphones, which they believed might contain footage of the night in April.

In the filing, Detective Constable David LaVallee wrote that the video could 'provide evidence of... drug possession against Robert Ford,' and drug trafficking and drug possession by James.

Rob Ford has not been charged with any crime. Toronto Police spokesman Mark Pugash declined to comment on the documents, saying the investigation into the mayor's conduct, dubbed Brazen II, is ongoing.

According to the documents, Kathy Ford told police that her brother arrived at her house 'intoxicated' but not 'high,' and that he was drinking and 'kidding around fighting' with Lisi in her home. Earlier reports claimed that the mayor had assaulted his friend Lisi.  

'Kathryn Ford and Robert Ford were smoking crack cocaine that night,' the documents state. 'Lisi was not doing drugs.'

Kathy Ford's grown daughter was asleep upstairs during the drug-fueled party.

Lisi has been charged with extortion related to attempts to retrieve the first crack video, whose existence was reported by the Toronto Star and the Gawker website in May 2013. 

Ford was inhaling crack when he was secretly photographed with a pipe in his hand by James, said his sister. The 20-year-old allegedly planned to sell the incriminating tape to media outlets for a six-figure sum, Toronto Sun reported. 

Kathy Ford's version of events also has called into question some of James' claims made in an interview with the Toronto Star.The 20-year-old had accused the mayor of hurling racially charged insults at him and tossing pennies at his feet as a sign of disrespect.

The Globe and Mail reported in May that it had seen the second crack video. The newspaper published still photos of the video, saying it paid $10,000 for them.

Lisi was also charged in October 2013 with trafficking in marijuana, possession of proceeds of crime, possession of marijuana and conspiracy to commit an indictable offence during the investigation into Ford.
