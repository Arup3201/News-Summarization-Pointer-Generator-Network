Everybody loves to write their own bucket list but few rarely get the opportunity to fulfill all of their lifelong dreams before they die. 

Intrepid duo, Jennifer Adams and Clint Bizzell, are fortunate enough to have travelled all over this Great Brown land for their jobs as television presenters on Channel Ten’s Places We Go and decided to reveal their top 100 best places across Australia.

To share their special journey, the couple took along their 18-month daughter, Charlie, and both of their mothers in two cars and a caravan in tow on their Down Under adventure.

Bizzell, a former AFL player, talks about seven of his best experiences that stood out for him while on the road trip with his family four years ago:

Favourite natural wonder: Mitchell Falls, Western Australia

'The first time I saw it was from the air in a helicopter because it was the wet season. 

'It's four-tiered - breathtaking and beautiful - a real sight to see.'

'Then we landed and trekked to it - it's such enormous water with so much power.'

'It was Mother Nature at its ultimate just doing it's thing - l felt very fortunate and lucky to have seen it.'

Favourite beach: Jervis Bay, New South Wales

'It's in the Guinness Book of records for the whitest sand in the world. If you take your sunnies off when the sun is bouncing off the sand if you've got to put them back on. The marine park is phenomenal when you're paddle boarding and dolphins are greeting you and whales are constantly there. It's especially good for families because there are no crazy dumping whales.'

Bizzell recalls dolphins greeting them while they were paddle boarding at Jervis Bay in southern NSW

Of all beaches in Australia, Bizzell chose Jervis Bay for it's gleamingly white sand - said to be the whitest in the world

Favourite country town: Birdsville, Queensland

'It has a really great sense of community - it's very tight knit,' he said. 'It's in the middle of nowhere and had that real feel of country with enormous amounts of cattle.' 

'Like any great country town it has a great pub with memorabilia. Spending time drinking beers with the locals is something I will always really treasure. 

'They envelope you with their warmness - it's really overwhelming.'

Favourite adventure: Diving with the Whale Shark, Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia

'It's the biggest fish of the ocean so your heart is in your mouth because you are not sure where it is or how big it's going to be - then they tell you to look under the water and because it's 15 metres long it looks like an underwater building effortlessly swimming along.'

'You are feeling excitement, exhilaration and fear at the end of the your fingertips. Then you swim alongside and realise it's harmless and you want to keep up with it but you're too tired after a couple of minutes. 

'Then you go on and look for another one - it's a real thrill seeking adventure.'

The 15 metre long whale shark left Bizzell feeling exhilarated as he swam alongside the amazing giant fish Ningaloo Reef, Western Australia

Favourite historical destination: Mount Borradaile, Arnhem Land, Northern Territory

'You fly in on a Cessna through all of the river systems and the airstrip is cut out of the jungle.'

'It has the greatest rock art in Australia but you would never expect it because it's in the middle of nowhere - surrounded by incredible history.'

'It's like a documentary of the Amurdak people who inhabited the land for over 50,000 years - its rock art depicting their everyday lives - it blew me away.'

Favourite city: Melbourne, Victoria

Despite being a Brisbane boy, Bizzell has lived in Victoria's capital city for 12 years and wouldn't have it any other way.

'It's got everything you could want - culture, art, sport, coffee which I  never drank until I moved here and a mate told me I had to start drinking it,' he said. 

'There's always something happening every weekend. I even like the weather - Jen doesn't though she likes it warmer.'

Favourite locals: Bruny Island, Tasmania

Bizzell has very fond memories of many people he met in Tasmania – particularly Bruny Island residents Get Shucked oyster operator Joe Bennett and Nick Haddow from the Bruny Island Cheese Company.

He described the Bruny folk - who were given the favourite locals gong - as giving, generous, open and fun.

'When you are walking past you are consumed and in your own head when I'm in Melbourne,' he said. 

'But In Bruny everybody says hello and sometimes it frightens you because you are not used to it.'
