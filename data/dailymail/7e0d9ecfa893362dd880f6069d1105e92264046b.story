James Alexander Gordon, the BBC broadcaster whose voice was synonymous with the classified football results on the radio, has died at the age of 78.

The BBC announced that Gordon, who retired last year after more than forty years with the corporation and had been battling cancer, had died.

Richard Burgess, the head of BBC sports news and BBC radio sport, described Gordon as 'a true gentleman', adding on Twitter: 'He will be greatly missed at BBC Sport.'

Much missed: James Alexander Gordon - JAG - to his fans joined the BBC in 1972 and went on to become one of the most recognisable voices on radio, reading the football results first on Radio 2 and then Radio 5 Live

Gordon, popularly known by his initials as JAG, joined the BBC in 1972 and went on to become one of the most recognisable voices on radio, reading the results first on Radio 2 and then Radio 5 Live.

His delivery made it possible to predict whether the result had been a home win, away win or draw simply from the inflection.

He retired in July 2013 after having his larynx removed to treat throat cancer and was replaced by Charlotte Green.

Fond tributes were quick to flood in following the announcement of his death, with Match of the Day host and former England striker Gary Lineker saying on Twitter: 'A voice we all know, the voice of the football results, James Alexander Gordon has died. Tottenham Hotspur 1.. Newcastle United 1.. #RIP.'

England goalkeeper Ben Foster tweeted: 'RIP James Alexander Gordon. Saturday afternoons checking Teletext and listening to the footy scores was The best.'

BBC pundit and the former Wales international player Robbie Savage said 'Such sad news about James Alexander Gordon who has sadly passed away, what a fantastic man with a great voice. RIP James.'

Former England player Jimmy Armfield, a Radio 5 live colleague of Gordon, said: 'Five Live and the football results have lost a friend today. I can remember before I joined and he came to the BBC that the style was more regimented. He put a different slant on to it. He went up with the voice and down with the voice.

'He seemed to pitch it just right. He did it all with perfect enunciation. That lovely voice, with the little trace of Scots in it, with the highs and lows. He knew when to lift it and put it down.

'He really was something special. People used to mark the pools coupon with the football results. James knew that. He always gave them time to find out whether it was 1, 2 or an X for the football pools.

'It wasn't the same picture at all when he started out. There was no satellite broadcasting. Matches weren't shown as they are now. Everything came down the line on the radio. He was the first point of contact for who had won. James knew it all. He had it all weighed up. He was the consummate professional.'

James Alexander Gordon was born at Edinburgh on February 10, 1936. He contracted polio as a child and spent much time in hospital, having to wear leg supports until his late teens. He joined the BBC as an announcer and newsreader after a career in music publishing. He began reading the results in 1974.

He died at the Sue Ryder-Duchess of Kent Hospice in Reading, Berkshire, after a battle with cancer. He was survived by his wife Julia and son David.
