The USA have revealed the dressing-room poster which will be used to motivate their players ahead of the last-16 clash with Belgium.

The giant design – with an eagle as its centrepiece – carries the words ‘Focused. Determined. We can. And we will. One nation. One team’ and ‘It won't be easy. It won't be painless. But it will be worth it’.

Jurgen Klinsmann’s men have been one of the surprise packages in Brazil and they have been cheered on by thousands of fans at the tournament, as well as millions back home, setting new records for soccer viewing figures.

Their trademark chant 'I
 believe that we will win, I believe that we will win, I believe that we
 will win,' will ring out around the Arena Fonte Nova in Salvador.

The
 simple, yet surprisingly rousing, chant has become a hit in America, 
with celebrities such as Will Ferrell and Kevin Costner starring in TV 
adverts aimed at inspiring the nation to get in to the World Cup spirit.
  

The fervor has clearly caught on with the song now the unofficial chant of Klinsmann's side.

The chant was originally created, according to Yahoo, by Naval Academy Prep school student Jay Rodriguez, who taught it to his class-mates. In the 16 years since, it has spread from American university campuses to navy football matches and now the greatest show on earth in Brazil. 

It
 may not be the most creative of chants but it is certainly catchy and 
undoubtedly goose-bumping. It also seems to inspire, with the USA 
managing to defy expectations and make it out of a tough group they were
 expected to struggle in.

No doubt America will believe it can inspire their players to pull off another victory against Belgium on Tuesday evening.
