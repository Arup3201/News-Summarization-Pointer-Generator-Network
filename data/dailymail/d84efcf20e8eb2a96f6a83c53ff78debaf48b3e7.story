He'd followed his son every step of the way and at his moment of victory in the U.S. Open on Father's Day Rory McIlroy turned to his beaming father Gerry and embraced him.

'Happy Father's Day, dad - this one's for you,' he added after he was presented with the prize at the course in Maryland.

It was a poignant moment and tribute to his father who had made so many sacrifices to help his son achieve his dream. For four years, his father worked 100 hours a week, cleaning toilets and showers — one of the three jobs he held — while wife Rosie clocked on for the night shift at a factory.

In stunning the world of golf with his eight-shot victory, the 22-year-old star from Northern Ireland became the youngest U.S. Open  champion since Bobby Jones in 1923 and his win follows countryman Graeme McDowell’s victory a year ago.

'Tastes good!!! wrote McIlroy when he posted this picture of himself drinking from the trophy on Twitter

McIlroy led the tournament from the first day, breaking records – many of them belonging to Woods – as easily as he broke par.

Close
 friend McDowell passed the  trophy to McIlroy with fulsome words of 
praise. He said: ‘It’s just phenomenal – you run out of superlatives to 
describe what he has done this week. He’s decimated a field. I’ve been 
waiting for this to happen. He’s that good, there’s no doubt about it.

‘I first heard about him when he shot 61 at my home course in Portrush.

'You hear rumours about people and good players come and go, but this kid was something a bit special.’

McIlroy’s masterclass was reminiscent
 of his boyhood idol Woods’s domination of the 2000 U.S. Open when he 
won by a record 15 shots at Pebble Beach.

McDowell added: ‘He’s potentially the next Tiger Woods – he’s that good. It’s great to see him fulfilling his potential.’

The victory marked an incredible transformation for McIlroy, who just two months ago had capitulated at the U.S. Masters in front of his army of loyal fans.

At Augusta in April, McIlroy had surrendered a four-stroke lead on the final day with a disastrous round of 80.

But the Masters meltdown is now a distant memory for McIlroy, who carded a masterful 16 under par - shooting 268 over four rounds - smashing the previous course record held by just four players including Jack Niclaus and Tiger Woods.

After raising his arms in triumph on the 18th hole, the young star immediately paid a touching tribute to his father Gerry.

McIlroy said: 'I could have holed a couple more putts today.

'Happy
 Father's Day dad, this one's for you. But I have to mention my mum as 
well, who's back home watching. I can't thank them enough.

'As
 Graeme [McDowell] said last year there will be a few pints of the black
 stuff going down tonight. I know my friends will be out partying and I 
can't wait to get back and join them.

'But
 the whole week has been incredible. I know how good Tiger was at Pebble
 in 2000 and I went out today to try and emulate him in some way.

'Augusta
 was a valuable experience. I knew what I needed to do today to win. I 
put a few new things into practice and it paid off.'

McIlroy, 22, came to prominence in Northern Ireland at an early age.

Distant memory: The record-breaking triumph for McIlroy made up for his heartbreaking collapse in April's U.S. Masters

In July 2005, shortly after turning 16, he went round Royal Portrush on the region's dramatic North Coast in a course record. He became European amateur champion the following year - it qualified him for The Open - and reached number one on the world amateur rankings.

The sportsman, from Holywood, Co Down, has won as a professional in the Dubai Desert Classic and the Quail Hollow Championship in North Carolina.

He was third at the US Open last year and third in the last two US PGA Championships.
