If former police officer Ken Olsen had not had a dashboard camera running in his car he might have had difficulty in describing what happened when he crossed paths with ‘a raving lunatic’ on the highway.

For reasons he cannot explain, he found himself on the receiving end of a very serious case of road rage, resulting in 10 minutes of terror and ending with the other driver flinging himself onto Mr Olsen’s bonnet and smashing his windscreen with his fists.

The extraordinary footage was shown on Australia’s Today Tonight show on Channel Seven, resulting in the crazed driver contacting police in Brisbane and telling them he was going to hand himself in.

Horror on the highway: The unidentified man leaps onto Ken Olsen's car bonnet and reigns blows onto his windscreen

Shattered: Mr Olsen said he had set out for a quiet drive in Brisbane, with an on-board camera running for pleasure. But it turned out to be anything but a quiet drive

‘This man was absolutely crazy – I feared for my life,’ said Mr Olsen, who said he was rammed more than seven times as the other driver tried to run him off the road and flip his vehicle over.

‘I had to go onto the footpath, got onto the footpath, and went over traffic islands with him in pursuit’ he told the TV programme.

‘I got around a traffic island, then he crunched into the side of me, so I had to go onto another footpath to get away from him.

‘He’d crashed into my vehicle so many times I was convinced it was going to stop going. And I thought once my vehicle is not going I have no protection – this bloke is going to kill me.

Mr Olsen said he had set out for a quiet drive in Brisbane, with an on-board camera running for pleasure. But it turned out to be anything but a quiet drive.

He said he does not know what angered the other driver, but he realised he was in trouble when the other man overtook him on the inside, shaking his fists.

Then began a chase which resulted in Mr Olsen’s car being rammed seven times – but during the terrifying incident he was able to call police and tell them that he was being subjected to violent road rage.
