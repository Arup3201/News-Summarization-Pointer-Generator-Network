Luis Suarez is now the third most valuable footballer in the world according to an authoritative new report, published today, that rates the Liverpool striker as worth £79million - at least.

Only Barcelona’s Lionel Messi, with a ‘starting price’ of £161.5m and Real Madrid’s Cristiano Ronaldo, worth at least £85.2m, are valued more highly in the study, compiled by a Swiss-based expert research centre.

The CIES Football Observatory has detailed knowledge of actual prices paid in thousands of transfers to ‘Big Five’ divisions over recent years, and have now published their annual review of players - including ‘market values’.

Revealed: The 20 most valuable players in Europe

A huge range of information is considered for each player to produce a ‘real world’ price tag of what each star should objectively be worth in the transfer market this summer. Age, the length of contract remaining, position, performance data, international experience and the level at which the players are working are all considered.

The stunning season enjoyed at Anfield by Uruguay forward Suarez, 27, has propelled him up the rankings of ‘most wanted’ among a string of elite clubs. The CIES study brackets his market value at between £79.4m and £92.3m.

Suarez cost Liverpool £22.8m from Ajax in January 2011 and has been linked with some of Europe’s top clubs in recent days, from Real Madrid to Manchester United, who are reportedly ready to bid £65m. On the basis of the CIES study, that would represent a huge under-valuation of the player.

The fourth most valuable man on the list is Chelsea’s Belgium starlet, Eden Hazard, 23, reckoned to be worth at least £61.2m. Chelsea paid around half that sum two years ago.

The top 10 is completed by Paul Pogba of Juventus, Real Madrid’s Gareth Bale - rated at £47.1m at least, or considerably less than he cost last summer - then Arsenal’s Mesut Ozil, PSG’s Edinson Cavani and Bayern Munich’s Mario Gotze.

Four England players make the top 20: Wayne Rooney plus three of the young Lions from Roy Hodgson’s World Cup squad - Raheem Sterling, Ross Barkley and Daniel Sturridge. Rooney is thought to be worth £29.6m, a bit less than the younger Sterling (£31.2m) and Barkley (£29.7m) and very lightly more than Sturridge (£29.4m).

Outside the top 20, Arsenal’s Jack Wilshere is rated as worth at least £27.6m and Southampton’s Luke Shaw is worth £23.2m.

Any footballer is only worth what a club will pay for him, of course, but the CIES study shows that their evaluation process stands up to scrutiny, with only a small historical variation between their valuations on players and the prices they actually move for. The margin of error is fairly insignificant 7.5 per cent.

Of the 20 highest valued players, nine of them play in the Premier League, for now at least, seven in Spain’s La Liga, two in Germany’s Bundesliga (Mario Gotze and Thomas Muller at Bayern Munich), one in France’s Ligue 1 (Cavani at PSG) and one in Italy’s Serie A (Pogba).

At the top end of the chart, Messi’s value is almost twice that of Ronaldo’s. The report’s author’s say: ‘This is mainly related to the younger age of the Argentinian prodigy, who was born 28 months after the Portuguese superstar.

‘However, with respect to the last year, Messi’s market value has gone down (by €19m) while that of Ronaldo increased (by €4m).

Prospect: Everton star Ross Barkley was ranked in the top 20 most valuable players in the World

England's future: Raheem Sterling was also in the top 20 after rising to fame with Liverpool
