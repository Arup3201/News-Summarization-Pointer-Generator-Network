A mother has spoken of her devastation after the NHS withdrew funding for an operation which could help her daughter walk for the first time.

Sophie Sharman, 10, from Bedworth, Warwickshire, was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when she was just eight weeks old and has never been able to walk unaided.

She was due to undergo a potentially life-changing procedure called Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham.

Sophie Sharman (pictured with her mother, Natalie), 10, has cerebral palsy and needs surgery to allow her to walk. She was offered the operation on the NHS but the offer was withdrawn because of budget cuts

The idea of the operation is to loosen the muscles to help patients walk independently.

But the NHS has now withdrawn its offer of funding the operation due to budget cuts.

The hospital announced it would only fund the operation for those children who had completed all the preliminary tests and had a date set for the operation.

Sophie had just one more test to undergo but in a cruel twist of fate, she was unable to attend because her mother, Natalie Rider, was rushed to hospital to have her gall bladder removed.

Had she made the appointment she would have had a date set for surgery and the NHS would not have withdrawn their offer of funding.

Ms Rider, 33, said she was devastated by the NHS decision.

She said: ‘I do blame myself in a way but I’m angry that Sophie is not being offered the surgery any more.

Sophie's mother is appealing the NHS decision but if this fails, she will have to try and raise the money herself

‘It seems unfair because she missed her second test through a legitimate reason and we’re being penalised.

‘It’s devastating. We were so close and because I fell ill and was unable to attend the final appointment, Sophie’s chance to walk has been cruelly snatched away.’

Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy is a neurosurgical technique used to treat spasticity (increased muscle tone) in the lower limbs.

The lower vertebrae are opened to reveal the spinal cord which contains the neurones of the central nervous system.

These neurones (bundles of nerve fibres) channel messages between the brain and different areas of the body.

Electrical stimulation is used to identify and sub-divide sensory and motor nerves.

This process continues until the specific nerves and nerve roots affecting the spastic muscles are identified and cut.

Due to the size of the nerves and rootlets, this is a very precise procedure and therefore the surgery can last several hours and requires a general anaesthetic.

Many months of physiotherapy are needed after the surgery to retrain the legs.

Ms Rider said she couldn’t understand
 how the NHS could fund gastric band and breast enlargement operations 
but were refusing to fund a procedure which could give children the 
opportunity to walk.

She
 is challenging the NHS decision but if she is unsuccessful, she will try 
to raise the money to fund the procedure herself which could cost up to 
£30,000.

She said: ‘The NHS has said there’s not enough proof the operation works, but if there’s even a small chance it could help her walk we want to take it.

‘Sophie’s school friend had the operation and is now learning to walk, so we’re hoping someone within the NHS will change their mind.

‘We’re in a horrible position at the moment and I’m trying to make as many people aware of what has happened.’

Ms Rider has set up a Facebook group and launched a petition calling for the NHS to fund the potentially life-changing operation.

James Hunter, clinical director for the musculoskeletal and neurosciences directorate at Nottingham University Hospitals, said: ‘We have been in contact with parents of children referred to NUH but where SDR surgery had not been agreed to inform them we will not be proceeding with any further pre-operative tests in light of the changes to funding arrangements for this treatment.

‘It would be unfair on these children and their families for us to continue a process which may not result in surgery.

'We’ve begun discussing treatment and funding options with each individual family.’

She only missed it because her mother was rushed to hospital for surgery
