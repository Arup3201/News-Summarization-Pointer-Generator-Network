His mother may be considered the trendsetter of the family, but Prince George has swiped her style crown and been voted the best-dressed member of the Royal Family.

The 11-month-old beat the Duchess of Cambridge and his great-grandmother The Queen to take the top spot in the poll.

George’s father Prince William came seventh in the online survey of 600 people.

Style icon: Prince George votes best-dressed member of the Royal family, beating even his mother the Duchess of Cambridge, who came in second

Trendsetter: With sales of George's outfits skyrocketing, it is no wonder he has been voted best-dressed royal

Ironically it is the Duchess of Cambridge who causes dresses to sell out whenever she is seen in public with them.

Yet her son has pipped her to the post, with 23 per cent of the vote.

The Duchess came in second with 21 per cent, followed by The Queen on 18 per cent.

They were followed by Princess Beatrice and Prince Harry, who came fourth and fifth respectively, with the Countess of Wessex and Prince William in sixth and seventh places.

Influential: So popular are Prince George's outfits, that whatever he wears sells out within hours, which retailers have dubbed 'the George effect'

Rounding out the top ten were Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, Princess Eugenie, and Zara Phillips.

The poll was carried out by My1stYears.com, a baby website.

It's not the first time that Prince George's style has been given the seal of approval. Trend-setters have praised his wardrobe for months and sales of his original outfits - and cheaper versions - have surged on the high street.

Retailers have dubbed it ‘the George effect’.

Dressed to impress: Kate in Brisbane, Australia on 19 April, left, and in Katoomba, Australia, on 17 April looking equally impeccable

The red-and-white stripy dungarees he 
wore at the weekend to his father’s polo match, which cost £33.99 from 
Spanish childrenswear brand Neck & Neck, have already sold out.

A similar pair in blue from French brand Petit Bateau (£39.50) were snapped up, too.

The
 young prince arrived at Sydney airport in April wearing a romper suit decorated
with sailing boats, £40 from Les Petites Abeilles. A budget version of 
the romper suit is available from mafanakids.co.uk, priced £21. Both sailed off the shelves.

It's no surprise that his mother Kate came in a close second. The Duchess' style is also admired the world over.

Fit for a Queen: Her majesty the Queen came third in a poll of the best-dressed members of the Royal family, behind Catherine Duchess of Cambridge and Prince George, who topped the poll. She wore this striking blue outfit at Ascot last week

Elegant: During the Royal Ascot races last week, H.M The Queen wore a flowery hat and matching dress

She is consistently praised for championing British designers such as Alexander McQueen, Alice Temperley, and Matthew Williamson, as well as high street brands Zara and Reiss.

As for the Queen, her love of bright, block colours, pearl accessories, plaid skirts and embellished hats has made her a style icon.

She
 has the fashion world's seal of approval, so much so that Dolce & 
Gabbana created an entire collection inspired by her signature looks and
 Donatella Versace described her as 'couture
 personified'.
