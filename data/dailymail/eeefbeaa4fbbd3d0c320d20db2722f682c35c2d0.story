Owners of high-end super cars are not afraid of making a statement. 

And the driver of this Rolls Royce is no exception - splashing out thousands of pounds to have the £300,000 model wrapped in black velvet.

The car, a Phantom drophead coupe, was spotted outside Harrods in the exclusive area of Knightsbridge, central London, where it attracted a few looks - and strokes - from passers-by.

Statement: The velvet wrap, which cost roughly £3,000, is the latest trend in super car customisation

The velvet wrap, which comes in a range of colours, is one of the latest trends in super car customisation - offering owners a bold alternative to 'boring' paintwork. 

Raccoon, a British garage that has carried out treatments on similar cars, estimated that the finish would have cost the Rolls Royce's owner £3,000.

Created by Velvet Car, a French company specialising in luxurious films and accessories, the service involves ‘wrapping’ the cars in a durable and weather resistant fibre. 

Named the Velvet Elite 9100, the wrap is available for all vehicle types.

It comes in a range of colours, including fuchsia pink and orange - designed to be a bold alternative to those bored with paint.

The wrap is coated with special adhesives and durable textile fibers to withstand severe weather conditions.

The material, which lasts for roughly three years, can be cleaned by hand or using a jet wash and does not need special products.

The first velvet-covered car in Britain was spotted on the streets of London last summer. 

A spokesman for the firm, which supplies the material to garages in the UK and overseas, said that the material, called Velvet Elite 9100, allows car owners to better express their style.

The fibre comes in a range of colours - including fuchsia pink and orange - and is available for all vehicle types.

It is coated with special adhesives and durable textile fibers to withstand severe weather condition.

The material will last roughly three years and, if the mystery owner has a change of heart, the wrap can be removed by professionals restoring the car to a just off the production line state.

It can be cleaned by hand or using a normal jet wash, without requiring any special products. 

A British company, Raccoon, was responsible for the UK's first velvet-covered car - a black Porsche that became an internet sensation when it was seen in London last summer.

Spokeswoman Alison Clark, said that since then the firm had completed eight wrappings - mainly for customers who were looking to stand out. 

She told MailOnline: 'We have done a couple, but it tends to be people looking to make a statement.'

Though the company did not wrap the black Rolls Royce, Ms Clark estimated that the treatment would have cost the owner roughly £3,000.  

Vibrant: The material comes in a range of other colours, including blue, orange - and this shocking hot pink
