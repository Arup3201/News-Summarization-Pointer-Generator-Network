Nicolas Anelka was on Monday ordered not to repeat his sick goal salute as it emerged Samir Nasri has also been photographed making the quenelle gesture.

Nasri posed for a picture with a friend outside Manchester City’s training ground two months ago.

He took to Twitter to apologise and insist the quenelle was meant to be a symbol against ‘the system’ and had no anti-Semitic meaning.

‘I apologise for causing any hurt to 
anyone who might have been misled into thinking this means anything of 
that nature,’ said Nasri.

West
 Bromwich Albion took a tough stance with their French striker after his
 gesture following a goal against West Ham provoked an international 
outcry.

Although Anelka has
 agreed not to repeat the gesture he did not apologise. This may be due 
to the FA investigation which could land him a ban of more than five 
games, according to new regulations governing race-related offences.

Albion
 caretaker boss Keith Downing admitted the club had been 
shocked to discover the quenelle gesture was considered anti-Semitic by 
many.

Anelka was asked 
about it by Downing after the game at Upton Park and told his manager it
 had been a dedication for his friend, French comedian Dieudonne.

The 
striker said he did not mean to cause offence but there was an outcry in
 France, where Saturday’s game was screened live.

Anelka
 was ordered on Monday to explain his actions to Albion sporting and 
technical director Richard Garlick before a statement was issued.

‘He
 again strongly denied intending to cause offence,’ said the statement. 
‘The club fully acknowledge Nicolas’s goal celebration has caused 
offence in some quarters and has asked Nicolas not to perform the 
gesture again. He agreed to adhere to this request.’

Anelka will play on during the FA’s lengthy investigation.

The
 quenelle has already caused problems in the NBA, where French-born 
basketball star Tony Parker, of the San Antonio Spurs, was condemned by 
Jewish groups after using the salute in a photo with Dieudonne.

Parker’s behaviour was ‘disgusting and dangerous’, said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center.

The Liverpool defender was pictured twice doing the gesture, once with Dieudonne, lastmonth. But he later said he did not know what it meant and had been ‘tricked’.

The Hull forward tweeted a picture of Anelka’s celebration and wrote: ‘Anelka is a legend i love him is a best french striker’ and included a message of support for Dieudonne.

Parker
 said: ‘When l was photographed making that gesture three years ago, I 
thought it was part of a comedy act and did not know it could be in any 
way offensive or harmful.

'Since I have been made aware of the 
seriousness of this gesture, I will certainly never repeat it and 
sincerely apologise for any misunderstanding.’

Dieudonne has convictions for 
spreading race hate, and last week interior minister Manuel Valls 
announced that ‘all legal means’ to ban Dieudonne from making public 
appearances were being considered, saying: ‘He attacks the  memory of 
Holocaust victims in an obvious and unbearable way.’

The
 quenelle — touching a shoulder with one hand, keeping the other arm 
pointed downwards — is said to be an inverted Nazi salute.

Dieudonne and
 his supporters claim it is merely an anti-Zionist, anti-establishment 
signal and the 47-year-old has threatened to sue those suggesting 
otherwise.

The gesture 
has gone viral on social media and two soldiers were sanctioned by the 
French army in September for performing it in uniform in front of a 
Paris synagogue.

Anelka had also taken to Twitter on Sunday night to insist that his gesture had no
 religious or anti-Semitic connection. He wrote: ‘Meaning of quenelle: 
anti-system. I do not know what the word religion has to do with this 
story!’

Support: QPR defender Benoit Assou-Ekotto tweeted a message to Anelka after his celebration

‘The
 quenelle is a dedication to Dini. With regard to the ministers who give
 their own interpretations they are the ones who create the confusion 
and controversy without knowing what the gesture really means! I shall 
therefore ask the people not to be duped by the media. And of course, I 
am neither anti-Semitic nor racist.’

Dieudonne
 applauded Anelka in a post on his Facebook page. ‘Excellent live 
quenelle by Anelka,’ he wrote. ‘Thanks for the support.’

But
 Anelka’s actions were roundly criticised elsewhere. Valerie Fourneyron,
 the French sports minister, said: ‘Anelka’s gesture is a shocking, 
disgusting provocation. There is no place for anti-Semitism and 
incitement to hatred on the football pitch.’

Chantal Jouanno, the former 
sports minister and a senator in Paris, said: ‘The quenelle is a Nazi 
gesture, clearly anti-Semitic and known as such. It is not worth arguing
 about interpretation. We must be clear about our values. He must be 
punished.’

European 
Jewish Congress president Dr Moshe Kantor wants Anelka dealt with as if 
he ‘had made the infamous outstretched arm salute’ of the Nazis.

‘It
 is sickening that such a well-known footballer would make such an 
abusive and hateful gesture in front of tens of thousands of spectators.
 We expect that the English Premier League officials as well as the 
police will give Anelka the appropriate punishment.’

A lengthy ban for Anelka may signal the end of his career, with rumours of his retirement already emerging earlier this season.

Hull
 forward Yannick Sagbo tweeted a picture of Anelka’s celebration and 
called him a ‘legend’ while expressing support for Dieudonne.

Other
 footballers have been pictured making the gesture, including Mamadou 
Sakho last month. But the Liverpool defender later said he had been 
tricked.

When
 West Brom striker Nicolas Anelka scored the first of his two goals in 
Saturday's 3-3 Premier League draw at West Ham, he celebrated by making a
 gesture largely unfamiliar to fans of English football.

But
 the salute, known in France as 'la quenelle', is the subject of a 
fierce national debate that has reached the French interior ministry and
 stands accused of sparking a spate of attacks across Anelka's homeland.

Here,
 we explore the origins of the controversial gesture and the motives of 
its self-proclaimed inventor, the stand-up comedian and political 
activist Dieudonne M'Bala M'Bala:
