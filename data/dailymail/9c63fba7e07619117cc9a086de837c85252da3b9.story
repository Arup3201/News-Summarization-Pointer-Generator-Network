Green and purple lights flicker across the star-strewn sky in these striking images of Iceland.

The photos were taken by Finn Beales, 36, who has accumulated more than 340,000 followers on Instagram thanks to his talent for capturing some of the world's most astounding scenery.

The professional photographer from Wales was in Iceland in late September and managed to spot the elusive Aurora Borealis.

He said: 'Iceland is probably the closest you can get to another planet without having to leave this world.

'It definitely has otherworldly characteristics anyway - the bizarre colours, desolate lava fields, ever changing weather, active volcanoes, tremendously powerful waterfalls.

'The earth itself feels so alive up there and it makes the perfect backdrop for my style of work.'

His Tumblr and Instagram followings have been instrumental in turning his hobby into a fully-fledged career.

He said: 'I have been an active user of Instagram for about three years now. I certainly realised it was possible to develop a large following but didn't anticipate it happening to myself.

'I guess I learned on the job, what worked, what didn't, and over time developed a style that resonates with folks.

'I receive an overwhelming number of comments on the work I post to Instagram - tens of thousands of likes and shares on other platforms like Tumblr too.

'It's all rather humbling, but I do find it difficult to maintain meaningful conversations with more than 340,000 people.'
