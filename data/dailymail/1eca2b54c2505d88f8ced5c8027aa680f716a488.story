The row over the BBC’s Left-wing bias escalated last night after it emerged that its latest recruit has written hundreds of blogs attacking Government policy.

Senior Tories are furious that Duncan Weldon, a former adviser to Harriet Harman and economist at the TUC, has been made economics correspondent of Newsnight despite little experience as a journalist.

He is the latest in a series of Left-wing appointments at the BBC – including Newsnight editor Ian Katz and former Labour Cabinet minister James Purnell – prompting concerns that the corporation is becoming increasingly biased against the Conservatives.

John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons culture, media and sport committee, said there were question marks about Mr Weldon’s ability to report objectively given his strong political beliefs.

Noel Edmonds says he and a group of wealthy investors want to buy the BBC to save it from ‘inevitable disaster’.

The presenter proposes to run it along commercial lines, saying yesterday that renewing the corporation’s licence fee agreement would be ‘as futile as giving medicine to a corpse’.

Edmonds, 65, who used to work for the BBC but now hosts Deal Or No Deal on Channel 4 – said his group was willing to pay the fair market price of the BBC and would slim down its bloated bureaucracy.

‘If ailing British companies such as Rolls-Royce, Land Rover, British Airways and Cadbury can be turned around, there is still hope for the BBC,’ he wrote in The Sunday Times.

‘The long-suffering British people deserve better. BBC management has pursued an expansionist strategy that defies logic and the founding laws of commerce.’

‘It is extremely important that whoever holds that position is seen to be both qualified and objective,’ he said. ‘There are certainly question marks raised in both those areas about this appointment.’

Tory MP Angie Bray, who also sits on the culture, media and sport committee, said: ‘There is a one-way street between the Left-wing and the BBC.

'This appointment is the equivalent of sticking two fingers up at those who are concerned about Left-wing bias.’

Over the past few years, Mr Weldon has made clear his hostility towards the Coalition’s spending cuts.

He has written a string of blogs on Left-wing websites, including LabourList, Left Foot Forward, the Fabian Society and the Guardian, repeatedly praising Labour leader Ed Miliband and criticising Chancellor George Osborne.

In one, he accused Mr Osborne of being ‘hyper-political’ and said his economic record was ‘disastrous’. Despite signs that the economy is recovering, Mr Weldon has not moderated his hostility.

Last month he dismissed improvements in the labour market, arguing: ‘There are causes for concern beneath the headlines.’

Concern has been raised at Mr Weldon’s lack of qualifications – he has never reported on economics nor worked in television.

Tory MP Rob Wilson said: ‘It will be extremely interesting to see how someone who helped formulate TUC and Labour economic policy can report on it objectively.

Mr Wledon, who has limited journalism experience, was former adviser to Labour politician Harriet Harman

‘I’m not sure what broadcasting experience Duncan Weldon has but it must be very good for the BBC to risk the objectivity of its flagship news and  current affairs programme.’

Mr Katz insisted he interviewed ‘at least ten’ candidates for the role but refused to say whether the BBC had encouraged Mr Weldon apply.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Duncan’s economic commentary is widely respected on all sides of the political spectrum as fair and intelligent. BBC journalists do not bring political views to work and Duncan will be no different.’
