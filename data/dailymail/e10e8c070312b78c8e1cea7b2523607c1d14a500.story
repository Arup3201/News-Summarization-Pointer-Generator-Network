The South Carolina woman who drove a minivan into the Florida surf with her three children buckled inside requested to see them again.

Ebony Wilkerson had been barred from any contact with her children, ages 3, 9 and 10, after she was accused of trying to kill them by plunging her car into the ocean. 

On March 4, a pregnant Wilkerson drove into the water at Daytona beach before exiting the minivan and attempting to stop bystanders from rescuing the children.

Blood sugar: The attorney for Ebony Wilkerson said that the pregnant mother's blood sugar was dangerously low, causing her to become severely disoriented, which may have led to allegedly trying to take her kids' lives 

Prosecutors charged she acted with 'premeditated design' after finding out she told her kids to close their eyes as they went in and that they'd soon be in a better place. 

'Mom was going to drive us in the ocean to die,' one child told investigators. 'She was crazy.'

One of the children fought with Wilkerson over the steering wheel as the car was entering the water and was able to lower the windows to call rescuers' attention.  

Hours before, Wilkerson's sister Jessica Harrell, 28, had called police after Wilkerson had driven from the house with the children and asked officers to perform a wellness check.

'She's talking about Jesus, that there are demons in my house, that I'm trying to control her, but I'm trying to keep them safe,' she told a 911 operator. 

An officer came across the family, and though the officer noted Wilkerson seemed mentally ill, the children were smiling and Wilkerson appeared lucid.

Waves: Good Samaritans and police ran to the car and were able to save the three children inside from any serious injury

Safe: The three children were rescued and taken into foster care, and Wilkerson has had no contact with them since

Evaluated: Wilkerson was twice committed involuntarily while being held in custody, once for the attempted drowning, and once for punching her belly after being arrested

She told him that she was afraid her ex-husband would find her in Florida and said she was going to a location arranged with a domestic violence counselor. 

In 2005, Lutful Ronjon, who was at the time Wilkerson's common-law husband, was arrested for domestic battery after an argument between the couple over receipts.

Wilkerson's public defender argued that Wilkerson's blood sugar was dangerously low at the time she drove into the ocean, making her severely disoriented.

Paramedics tested Wilkerson's blood sugar level at 44, far below the threshold of 70 milligrams per deciliter, considered abnormally low according to the American Diabetes Association.

Wilkerson was seen 'beating her stomach with her fists' after her arrest, leading officers to bring her to the hospital for a psychiatric evaluation.

Circuit Judge Leah Case will hear her request for visitation Friday morning. She gave birth to her fourth child, a boy, in May. Since her arrest, she has not been allowed contact with her children.

According to the Daytona Beach News-Journal, Wilkerson is out of jail on $90,000 bail while awaiting trial. She's charged with three counts each of attempted second-degree murder and child abuse.
