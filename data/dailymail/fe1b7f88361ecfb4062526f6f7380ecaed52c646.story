For Gianfranco Zola, the only way is up after the former West Ham and Watford boss's return to management at the helm of Serie A relegation battlers Cagliari was a 5-0 thrashing by Palermo.

But the Italy and Chelsea legend is ever the optimist and despite the worst possible start to his time with the Sardinian side on Tuesday he believes the club can turn their season around.

'It's not the best of starts,' he told the Italian media.  'We knew that Palermo would be a difficult rival. But I believe this loss will be a lesson from my players and we will work hard to improve.

'We cannot dwell on the defeat, we have to react in the best possible way.

'I believe I can give my contribution. We have good players and this team can come out of this difficult situation.'

Zola took the place of Zdenek Zeman, who was sacked after Cagliari managed just one win in a run of 12 matches and just two of their 16 games in the Serie A.

Cagliari are four points adrift of safety, sitting third bottom ahead of only Parma and Cesena. 

'I know that the Cagliari that we saw against Palermo is not the real Cagliari,' Zola said. 'I nevertheless expect a lot more from my players.

'The Serie A is a tournament that makes you pay if you make mistakes. I know that this is the start of a long journey and for us it's a marathon.'
