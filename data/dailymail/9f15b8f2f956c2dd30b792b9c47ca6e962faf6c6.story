The bar for successfully trashing hotels has been high since the sixties when The Who's drummer celebrated turning twenty years old by taking off his clothes and driving a car into a swimming pool.

While the damage done to suites nowadays is no less devastating, some argue the barometer for rock and rock room trashing is petering off. 

Ash, cigarette burns and rubbish are  more likely to be left behind by reality stars and manufactured pop artists rather than smashed works of art and TV sets.

Celebrities from all walks of life have been trashing hotel rooms for years causing catastrophic damage

Still, the dying art is still very much alive as reality TV star Scott Disick proved weeks earlier when he wrecked havoc in a hotel in Colorado. Whatever the occasion, it never basks those involved in glory. 

MailOnline Travel recaps the top ten most memorable moments of hotel destruction and those who had to pay the price.

Scott Disick - 2015

Best known as Kourtney Kardashian’s wayward partner in MTV’s Keeping Up With The Kardashians, Scott Disick grabbed the limelight last month for allegedly tearing up a  hotel room while on holiday in Aspen in Colorado.

TMZ reported that the 31-year-old had been staying at Hotel Jerome when things escalated and one of his party jumped over the lobby bar to nab a bottle of alcohol.

A hotel source said guests had complained about the stink of marijuana coming from the star's room and the next morning management discovered empty bottles and cigarette butts littering the room.

The party spent $1,440 on drinks that evening and the next day and the hotel slapped on an extra $500 fine as the room was supposed to be non-smoking.

Keith Moon, the Who – 1967

If modern day celebrities think they’re behaving dangerously by smoking indoors, they ought to look up Keith Moon. 

The drummer from the Who will go down in hotel trashing history for his 20th birthday celebrations at a Holiday Inn in Flint, Michigan, following a concert by the band. Carnage ensued after a giant cake with a girl inside was delivered.

Moon initiated a food fight which lead to fire extinguishers being emptied in the hotel's hallways. Furniture was tossed about and the police were quickly called. Moon stripped completely naked (although some reports say he kept his underwear on) and made a dash to get away.

After streaking through the lobby he jumped into a car, a Lincoln Continental, in the car park and drove it through a fence into the hotel’s pool. Still set on escape he tried to run again, slipped on some marzipan and knocked out his front tooth.

The star spent the night in jail, notched up $24,000 in damages and the band received a lifetime ban from all Holiday Inns.

Rolling Stones – 1972

Keith Richards set the benchmark for rock star misbehaviour when he threw a TV set out of a tenth storey window of the Hyatt West Hollywood in Los Angeles.

The balconies are now enclosed so you have to smash a window to be able to do the same thing.

Amanda Bynes – 2013

The actress reportedly left pools of grime, rubbish and ash behind after she was asked to leave the Ritz Carlton following a nine day stay at the New York venue. According to TMZ, guests had complained about her smoking and alleged drug use and for being rude to staff.

Pictures emerged shortly afterwards of the room’s poor state with food, beauty products, linen and cigarette ash strewn about.

The smoke detector had been wrenched from the ceiling and left on a side table by the bed. The then 27-year-old former child star faced a $9,000 bill and was later forcibly hospitalised following concern about her mental state.

Nirvana – 1993

As trails of destruction go, this is probably one of the most blatant; a reporter was with the band for the entire debacle. After an interview with MTV News’ Kurt Loder Nivana’s drummer Dave Grohl and bassist Kirst Novoselic retired to a hotel room in St Paul, Minnesota.

Loder joined them and at about 4am, he says, Kurt and Dave started smashing pictures against the wall and destroying anything they could lay their hands on. Security was sent up so the group made a beeline to Loder’s room where the carnage continued. 

A coat stand was used to break a TV set and they faced a $19,000 bill the next day. Loder later said he was trying to stop them throughout.

Florence Welch - 2012

Her voice may be angelic but it appears her behaviour is not always. 

The singer confessed in an interview to an alcohol fuelled rampage after a night partying with Kanye West that culminated in setting her room at New York’s Bowery Hotel alight.

She explained to Q Magazine; ‘I think I must have had about 17 dirty martinis. I lost my phone and ripped my dress very badly. I accidentally set fire to The Bowery Hotel because I’d left a cinnamon tea light burning.

‘I came back to the hotel, passed out in my ripped dress — no phone, chipped tooth — came round and there was black stuff all over the wall, my book had melted on the bedside table and there was a bucket of water on the floor.’

Amy Winehouse – 2007

A ruckus was heard coming from singer Amy’s room, which she was staying in with husband Blake Fielder Civil, at London’s Sanderson Hotel. 

Guests called security on hearing the clattering of furniture and screaming from the £500 a night room.

The couple emerged  battered and bruised and their room was found to be in disarray with a scratched floor and smashed table.

It cost the hotel £9,000 to mop up the mess and a source told the Sunday Mirror that specialists were called in to remove blood from the walls.

Lindsay Lohan – 2012 (and 2007)

Keen to throw a good party, the actress allegedly caused $50,000 worth of damage to her suite in New York’s Union Square W Hotel. 

According to a hotel source, the then-26-year-old’s floor was so littered with cigarette burns that the carpet had to be changed and cleaning staff took months to pull the room back into shape.

It wasn’t her first transgression; in 2007 she allegedly trashed Room 645 at Shutters on the Beach Hotel in Santa Monica after a three night stay with her ex-boyfriend.

An unnamed source told Star magazine at the time: ‘There was filth everywhere and the room stank of cigarette smoke.... There was also a bloody syringe that someone left lying on the bedside table on a room-service tray. Hotel security photographed it before calling someone to remove it, because it was considered hazardous waste.’ Lindsay was blacklisted from the latter.

Johnny Depp – 1994

One of the most unlikely excuses for a demolished hotel room comes from the Pirates of the Caribbean actor. While staying at the Mark Hotel in New York in 1994 he was arrested on suspicion of criminal mischief.

Depp blamed the mess on an armadillo that has been hiding in a wardrobe although it was never found 

He’d reportedly got drunk and began fighting with his then-girlfriend Kate Moss. 

The charges were dropped when he agreed to pay almost $10,000 in damages and fees. Depp blamed the mess on an armadillo that has been hiding in a wardrobe, although it was never found.

Edie Sedgwick – 1965

Andy Warhol’s muse was apparently deemed such a liability she was put in room 105 at the Chelsea Hotel above the lobby where she could be more carefully monitored.

While staying at the New York hotel in the Sixties she would routinely fall asleep with candles burning.

Despite a warning about the fire hazard from Leonard Cohen, the screen beauty set fire to her room in 1966, reportedly leading the hotel to take the preventative action.
