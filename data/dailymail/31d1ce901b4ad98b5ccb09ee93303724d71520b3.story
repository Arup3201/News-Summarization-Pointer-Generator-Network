Neil Kinnock has dismissed concerns about Labour’s flagship mansion tax policy

Neil Kinnock has dismissed concerns about Labour’s flagship mansion tax policy, saying it would not cost property millionaires any more each month than the price of a single lunch out.

The former party leader said: ‘For the people who are asset-rich and very prosperous, a couple of hundred quid a month isn’t going to make a difference. They would spend that on lunch.’

Those owning homes worth between £2million and £3million would have to pay £250 a month. But the charge is likely to be much higher for those with more expensive properties. 

The levy will have to average £1,030-a-month to raise its target of £1.2billion a year.

Lord Kinnock, who backed Mr Miliband for the leadership in 2010, also said businessmen have nothing to fear from the Labour leader. He told the Financial Times: ‘Nobody’s talking about raising corporate taxation. 

'Nobody’s talking about anything other than the encouragement and reward for medium and long-term investment.’

Tory MP Rob Wilson last night tweeted: ‘Socialist Neil Kinnock feels spending £250 on a lunch is no problem. Mind you he was an EU commissioner in Brussels!’

Labour estimates the tax will apply to fewer than 0.5 per cent of the homes in the country, with those earning less than £42,000 able to defer paying the charge until their property changes hands.

But the policy has caused division within the party, with senior figures publicly at war with each over whether it is a good idea.

Lord Mandelson last month dismissed the plan as ‘crude’ and ‘short-termist’.

And Mr Miliband was left humiliated last year after he was unceremoniously taken to task over the proposal by TV personality Myleene Klass.
