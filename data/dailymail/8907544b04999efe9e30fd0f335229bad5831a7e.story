The Government was accused yesterday of colluding with the Kremlin by blocking a call for a public inquiry into the death of Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko.

Ministers refused a coroner’s request to replace with a public inquiry the current inquest into how the former KGB agent was poisoned with radiation at a London hotel.

Mr Litvinenko’s widow Marina yesterday described the decision as ‘shocking’ and her legal team accused Russia and Britain of colluding to stop the inquiry.

Justice: The family of Alexander Litvinenko wanted a public inquiry into his death in 2006

Dismay: Marina Litvinenko outside the Royal Courts of Justice, in central London today where she vowed to continue her quest for the truth

She will now seek a judicial review 
for a public inquiry that will hear in private sensitive evidence about 
Mr Litvinenko’s work and Russia’s involvement in his November 2006 
death.

Sir Robert Owen asked Justice 
Secretary Chris Grayling for the public inquiry due to concerns he 
cannot fully investigate the case.

This was because evidence from MI5 
and MI6 about the death would remain secret. At the inquest at the High 
Court yesterday he said his request had been rejected without 
explanation.

Alexander Litvinenko poisoned with radioactive polonium-210 while drinking tea at the Millennium Hotel in London's Grosvenor Square in 2006

Foreign Secretary William Hague last 
month successfully applied for some sensitive material, including 
evidence on whether the Russian government was involved in the death, to
be kept private.

This meant it could not be considered during the inquest.

The court has already heard that the Government has ‘established’ Moscow has a case to answer over Mr Litvinenko’s death.

Asked outside court if she thought 
Britain preferred good relations with Russia rather than justice, Mrs 
Litvinenko replied: ‘We can all see this. This is what it looks like.’

She said that it was a ‘political 
decision’, adding: ‘Were they trying to protect the Russian state? Were 
they trying to protect national security secrets?

‘I respect England as a country and I still believe in this country.  I believe again that we will  get justice.’

Mrs Litvinenko’s solicitor Elena 
Tsirlina said: ‘What has happened behind the scenes and publicly between
Russia and Britain is  very hard to say, but it is shocking that this 
public inquiry has  been stopped.’

Close friend Alexander Goldfarb said: 
‘This decision will stand in the same line as the long history of 
appeasement to dictatorships.’

Mr Litvinenko, 43, was poisoned with 
radioactive polonium-210 while drinking tea at the Millennium Hotel in 
Mayfair at a meeting with former KGB agents Andrei Lugovoy and Dmitry 
Kovtun. Both deny involvement in his death.

The Crown Prosecution Service wants to charge Mr Lugovoy, but Russia refuses to extradite him.

Sir Robert said the start of  the formal inquest, originally scheduled for October, would now be delayed.
