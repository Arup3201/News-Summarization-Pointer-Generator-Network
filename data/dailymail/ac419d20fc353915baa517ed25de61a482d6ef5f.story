Battery life is consistently listed as a major feature customers want from their gadgets – and it’s such a major sticking point, Apple is even said to have delayed launching its smartwatch to get it right.

And while many smartwatches boast a two to seven-day battery life, an Illinois-based site is selling a design that is said to last for an entire year.

It is also almost half the price of Apple’s device, at $179.95 (£110), and connects to any Android or iPhone device.

The No-Charge watch (pictured left) uses one set of batteries for an entire year. It connects to a range of smartphones using Bluetooth Smart technology. When someone calls the connected phone, the watch displays the caller ID, as well as texts, emails, social media posts, and calendar appointments (pictured right)

When someone calls the connected phone, the watch displays the caller ID. 

It also shows texts, emails, social media posts, and the phone’s battery status.

Buttons on the side of the bezel let wearers play or pause music playing on the phone, or take a picture.

The water-resistant watch has a stainless-steel bezel and scratch-resistant glass.

The No-Charge watch is available from online retailer Hammacher Schlemer.

According to the gadget’s product page, the watch uses one set of batteries for an entire year.

It connects to a range of smartphones using Bluetooth Smart technology.

This uses a fraction of the energy required by older versions of Bluetooth, claims the firm, ‘allowing the batteries to last up to one year and eliminating tedious recharging’.

When someone calls the connected phone, the watch displays the caller ID, and will also reveal the number of missed calls.

Elsewhere, the No-Charge watch shows incoming texts, emails, social media posts, calendar invites and appointments, and the phone’s battery status.

The watch has a stainless-steel bezel, scratch-resistant mineral glass, and a rubber strap. It is also water resistant.

Battery life is consistently listed as a major feature customers want from their gadgets – and it’s such a major sticking point, Apple is even said to have delayed launching its smartwatch (pictured with chief executive Tim Cook) to get it right

The closest  Mr Cook (pictured) came to talking about the battery life for the $349 (£216) Apple Watch, during a launch event last month, was saying that users would ‘charge it at night.’ He did, however, spend time talking about the watch's charging system, which combines Apple’s MagSafe technology with inductive charging

By comparison, Samsung’s Galaxy Gear 2 Neo (pictured) claims to have a six-day battery life

Apple is said to be unhappy with its own watch's battery life, and, as a result, the $349 (£216) device is not expected to ship before February.

Most existing smartwatches on the market, such as the Pebble, tend to last up to a week on a single charge.

Samsung’s Galaxy Gear 2 Neo claims to have a six-day battery life, but, in reality, this is closer to four days.

The closest Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook came to talking about the battery life for the watch, during a launch event last month, was saying that users would ‘charge it at night.’ 

He did, however, spend some time talking about the watch's charging system, which combines Apple’s MagSafe technology with inductive charging.

Smartwatches have grown in popularity this year.

Samsung recently unveiled its Gear S device, the Moto 360 is set to launch later this month, and O2 has announced it is the only UK mobile network to stock the newly-launched Pebble and Pebble Steel Smartwatches.

The Pebble Smartwatch costs £99 ($99), and the Pebble Steel costs £179.00 ($199).

Both models are also available from retailer Firebox.

The Pebble smartwatch is said to last up to a week on a single charge. Earlier this week, O2 announced it is the only UK mobile network to stock the newly-launched Pebble and Pebble Steel Smartwatches (pictured left to right). The Pebble Smartwatch costs £99 ($99), and the Pebble Steel costs £179 ($199)
