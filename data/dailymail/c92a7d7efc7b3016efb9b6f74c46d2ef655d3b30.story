For today's schoolchildren, the First World War can seem like such an impossibly distant piece of history that it is difficult for them to relate to.

But thousands of youngsters as young as four and five have written deeply moving letters, full of hope and fear and hugs, to an Unknown Soldier fighting on the frontline to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the Great War.

They include drawings, poems and flashes of deeply personal reflection on what life was like both in the trenches and for the sons and daughters left at home.

Thousands of schoolchildren have written letters to an Unknown Soldier as part of a project inspired by a statue on platform one at Paddington Station of an Unknown Soldier reading a letter

The tributes have been inspired by a statue on platform one at Paddington Station of an Unknown Soldier reading a letter.

The project aims to connect today’s generation with the sacrifice of those sent into battle a century ago.

Organisers say 'it's a striking way to make a personal and permanent mark on this centenary'. 

More than 6million British men were mobilised during the war, and more than 700,000 were killed.

At least 14,000 people have already submitted letters, including celebrities like Stephen Fry, Andrew Motion, Sheila Hancock, Andy McNab and Dawn French.

In his letter, David Cameron tells the young soldier how ‘our world would have been far darker if you had declined the call to act’.

But the letters from children stand out for the things they focus on, and the obvious impact of studying the war during lessons.

The letters reflect on both the horror of life in trenches, and the fears of those left behind at home

Many reflect on photos, medals and mementoes of lives they never knew, passed down through generations.

They refer to the horrendous injuries suffered by so many, and to how different life is now, how 'technology and fashion is completely new'.

Some are deeply personal, addressed to great-grandfathers who gave them middle names, while others are purely fictional. 

Here we present a selection of letters from schoolchildren across the country. You can read more at the 14-18 Now website 

Melanie Nicoll, 11, focussed on the fear of her and her family, and missing a father's jokes

Molly Jackson, 11, a pupil in Wirral, used a personal memory of buying ice-cream to humanise the relationship with the Unknown Solider

Student Mary Cate Miller dedicated her letter to 'all the horses of WWI and the soldiers who loved them. Their bond inspired me, and continues to do so'

Nethu Amadooru, 12, from Liverpool, wrote this letter with a poppy border

Nine-uear-old Thomas Frith wrote this simple letter, with drawings of a father and son
