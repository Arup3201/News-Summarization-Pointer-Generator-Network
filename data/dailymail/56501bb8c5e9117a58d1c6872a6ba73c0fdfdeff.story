Watching her daughter playing happily with her toys, Sarah Pegnall smiles.

She never imagined in her wildest dreams think she would ever fall pregnant, let alone now have a three-year-old little girl she conceived naturally.

Doctors told Sarah that because she was severely overweight and suffered from PCOS, that she would never fall pregnant with her own child and refused IVF treatment because at 16st 2lb, she was simply not eligible for treatment.

Super slimmer: Sarah was determind not to give up her dream of becoming a mother and went on a mission to shed an incredible 6st 2lb and dropping from a size 24 to size 12

'It was horrendous,' said Sarah. 'I thought it was my given right as a woman to have a baby but when I was told that right was being taken away from me, I felt humiliated.'

Sarah, from Romford, Essex, was determined not to give up her dream of becoming a mother and went on a mission to lose weight, shedding an incredible 6st 2lb and dropping from a size 24 to a much more svelte size 12.

After turning to the Rosemary Conley plan to help her realise her dream, Sarah was then shocked to discover she was pregnant after losing just two stone.

'It was completely unexpected as I thought I would have to lose all the weight and then get fertility treatment but to fall pregnant naturally was incredible.'

After a difficult birth, Sarah became housebound and began to take comfort in food again. 

'I was eating because I was bored, lonely and tired!

'I’d eat a whole family-sized chocolate bar and a pint of cola or Dr Pepper, just to get me through the 4am feed,' adds Sarah.

It was only when Sarah, who was then back up to a size 24, found she had nothing to wear that she was kick-started into losing weight again.

She was going to make herself a dress but the pattern only went up to a size 22.

'I didn’t want to be the fat one in the family and, once again, set out to lose weight with exercise DVDs and healthy eating,' says Sarah, who reached her goal weight in June 2012.

Exercise is now key for Sarah and as well as walking to work three times a week, she also works out at home on her exercise bike, running machine and to DVDs at least three times a week and takes part in a Zumba class each week.
