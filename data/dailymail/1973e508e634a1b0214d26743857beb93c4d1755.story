Tragedy: Isobel Dobson, two, died in a raging fire at a farm in West Yorkshire. Her stepfather has been arrested in connection with the blaze

The stepfather of a two-year-old girl who died inside a burning van during a fire at a riding stables has been arrested on suspicion of her murder.

He was also being held for the attempted murder of the girlâ€™s one-year-old stepsister, who was rescued from the same vehicle and escaped serious injury.

Isobel Dobson died after being trapped in the van when
fire broke out at Hessle Farm, Wragby, near Wakefield, West Yorkshire, on
Friday evening.

The two adults are thought to have left 
the children in the van to deal with the horses and returned to rescue 
them when they realised that the fire had spread to the van.

Isobel's mother and 37-year-old stepfather managed to rescue their
one-year-old daughter but were beaten back by the flames as they
tried to save the second little girl.

Last night, West Yorkshire Police said a 37-year-old man, from
Wakefield, was being questioned in connection with the fire, which they are now treating as suspicious.

A spokesman said: 'A 37-year-old Wakefield man has now
been arrested in connection with the incident and is currently in police
custody.

Horrific: Isobel and her one-year-old half sister were trapped in a burning van tragically her stepfather and mother were only able to rescue the younger child

Investigation: A police forensics officers photographs the van in which two-year-old Isobel Dobson died

'Inquiries into the cause of the fire, which is now
being treated as suspicious, are ongoing and a joint investigation is being
carried out by West Yorkshire Police and West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue
Service.'

Emergency services were called to the fire at about 5.30pm
on Friday and found a van and two barns ablaze on their arrival.

Isobel and her half-sister were in the van when the fire
broke out.

The 37-year-old man and the girls' 22-year-old mother
rescued the baby from the vehicle but were unable to free Isobel.

The two-year-old's body was found on Friday night and police
confirmed she had died.

On Saturday a police spokesman had said: 'Isobel and her
one-year-old half-sister were in the van when the fire broke out and, despite
efforts by her 37-year-old stepfather and mother, they were only able to rescue
the one-year-old girl before being beaten back by the flames and injured.

The spokesman added: 'The family have asked the media
to respect their privacy at this very difficult time.'

'Sleep tight': A moving message from the young victim's grandmother was among tributes left at the scene

The family were at the farm tending to a horse at livery
stables before the fire broke out.

Yesterday, Assistant Chief Fire Officer Martyn Redfearn, of
West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service, said: 'Our condolences go out to
the family and friends of the child.'

He continued: 'The firefighters worked very hard and
were very moved dealing with this scene, as we always are dealing with
tragedies like this.'

Ten fire engines were sent to the scene at the height of the
huge blaze and firefighters remained at the farm yesterday.

The man and his baby daughter received treatment for burns
at Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield and were discharged yesterday.
