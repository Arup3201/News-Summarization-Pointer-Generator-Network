An airport passenger who decided to track his car after leaving it with a firm offering a 'secure parking area' discovered it had actually spent a week in a muddy field.

The car - and scores of others - were parked on land about four miles from Manchester Airport in Styal, near Wilmslow.

The site did not have perimeter fencing, CCTV or lights and was only discovered after the passenger used his car’s tracker to find out where it had been during his week-long break.

An airport passenger who decided to track his car after leaving it with a 'secure parking area' discovered it had actually spent a week in a muddy field - surrounded by scores of other vehicles

He booked online through an agency that uses a number of car parks around the airport.

His car was picked up and dropped off at the airport after he says he was told it would be kept in a secure area.

He said: 'I was horrified when it showed where my car had been kept while I was on holiday.

'My car had been stored in a field where there is no security fence, CCTV or any kind of lighting and also this is clearly visible from the main road.

'I thought I was going to get a security perimeter fence, CCTV and also electric gates and on-site security – yet having visited the site myself I found none of this to be evident.'

It is not clear which firms are parking cars at the site.

An airport spokesman said: 'The security of our passengers and their belongings is of utmost importance to us at Manchester Airport, which is why we always recommend booking one of our eight secure car parks.'

Extra parking spaces could soon be built at the airport to ease congestion – and cater for growing passenger numbers.

Airport chiefs have applied to build a 9,000-space car park on fields in Wythenshawe.

The controversial plan has sparked fury from residents who say it will destroy dwindling greenbelt land – and prompt passengers to park on their roads to save money before boarding a shuttle bus.

The low fences in the car park do not appear to be secured, and the cars were parked in lines surrounded by puddles and mud

The airport has eight public car parks with 15,595 spaces and eight staff car parks with 5,535 spaces – but a 3,110 space car park closed in 2010.

The 24-hour car park is earmarked for the Styal Road, Ringway Road and Shadowmoss Road area which is to the north-east of the site.

It is part of the airport’s overall development of the site, which will include the removal of a 3,000-space car park to make way for Airport City.

The plans are due to be discussed at a planning meeting tomorrow and councillors will undertake a visit to the proposed car park site.
