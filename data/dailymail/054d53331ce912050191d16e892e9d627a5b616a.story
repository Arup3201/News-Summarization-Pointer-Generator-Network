A widow has claimed doctors put her terminally ill husband on an 'end of life pathway' without telling her, denying her the chance to share his final days with him.

Liz Watson, whose husband George was admitted to a Marie Curie Hospice for respite care, hit out at doctors after his condition deteriorated rapidly.

She says Mr Watson was the 'love of her live' and 'didn't deserve to die like he did' on the pathway, which sometimes involves depriving patients of food and water.

Liz Watson, from Edinburgh said doctors put her husband George - the 'love of her life' - on an end of life pathway without her knowledge

Mrs Watson said she would never have agreed to the care plan, which she likened to a 'concentration camp', and wanted to spend more time with her husband

Mr Watson was diagnosed with a brain tumour 17 months before he was admitted to the hospice from which he never came home 

Mr Watson was diagnosed with a brain tumour 17 months before he was admitted to the hospice. from which he never came home.

His family said the 64-year-old from Liberton in Edinburgh was going shopping and 'eating three-course meals' before he rapidly declined in the centre in Fairmilehead.

Mrs Watson said she only realised George was on the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway - which involves withdrawal of medication, food and fluids - when her mother recognised the signs.

She said she would never have agreed to the care plan, which she likened to a 'concentration camp', and wanted to spend more time with her husband.

She said: 'When I realised what they had done to my husband and put him on that Liverpool Care Pathway, I was hysterical.

'I am not a stupid person but I never put two and two together. They made out that they went through it with me but I would never have let my husband go on anything like that.

The Liverpool Care Pathway, originally designed to ensure dignified and pain-free dying, was scrapped last year after a scathing independent inquiry found that it had meant ‘uncaring, rushed and ignorant’ treatment of the most vulnerable hospital patients. 

In some cases, patients were denied water as they died.

Under the Pathway, doctors and nurses decided when a patient was about to die.

Commonly, a syringe driver would pump them with sedatives, while tubes giving food and water were detached. Death would follow, typically within 36 hours.

The inquiry was called after leading medical figures condemned the system as a ‘self-fulfilling prophecy’, and thousands of families of patients who had died complained.

New rules for the care of patients thought to be near the end of their lives will forbid hospitals from deciding that someone is dying and then speeding their end by drugging them and removing tubes giving them food and water.

Instead, there must be regular reviews of treatment in all cases, dying patients and their families must be kept informed and involved in decisions, and treatment will be ‘tailored to the individual’.

Hospitals will be told to appoint independent assessors to decide on complaints in ‘serious or untoward incidents’. 

'My husband was on it for four days. I called that place a concentration camp, depriving him of food and water.

'I was taking him in some ice lollies and he was so thirsty he nearly ate the stick.

'He couldn't talk but he knew what was happening. 

'I would tell him to blink with his eyes when I asked him things like if he was thirsty, he could hear everything that was going on.

'He was crying and I would say,"I'm so sorry George that I didn't get you out of this place". It was too late by then.'

Mr Watson worked as a homeless warden for Edinburgh City Council, while his wife worked in the care industry for 30 years.

He was diagnosed with the aggressive tumour in March 2012 before undergoing surgery to remove the growth.

He then went through several gruelling sessions of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

A few months later, the couple of 15 years were finally married at the Apex Hotel, on Waterloo Place in Edinburgh.

But just six months later doctors delivered the devastating news that the cancer had spread to the other side of his brain.

Mrs Watson, who had taken nine months off work to look after him, agreed to respite care, believing he would return home within days.

But on August 10, 2013 - three weeks later - he died.

Medical notes showed doctors started Mr Watson's end of life treatment at 11am on August 6 and were supposed to discuss it with family at 4pm - which Mrs Watson maintains 'never happened'.

She said the standard of nursing he received before that date was 'atrocious', as he even had two falls while staying there.

A later inspection by Healthcare Improvement Scotland upheld several complaints about care standards, including poor communication about his worsening condition, and made a list of recommendations.

But following a recent unannounced inspection last month, it was found many improvements had still not been carried out.

The watchdog made five requirements and 11 recommendations that must be addressed 'as a matter of priority'.

Mr Watson's stepdaughter, Kelly Macmillan, 33, who also worked in residential care, said the experience had left her mother 'shattered'.

She said: 'It was so distressing to see how quickly he deteriorated in there.'

Marie Curie said it was unable to comment on care relating to an individual patient.

A spokeswoman for NHS Lothian said: 'Like every health board in Scotland, NHS Lothian is following Scottish Government guidance on the Liverpool Care Pathway and phasing it out.'

But Mrs Watson said the changes were too late for her husband, adding: 'He didn't deserve to die like he did.

'He was the love of my life. I don't think it's something I will ever be able to get over.'
