Storm: David Silvester caused outrage by saying gay marriage had caused an Old Testament style flood

A local politician who claimed Britain was flooded because the nation legalised gay marriage is being investigated over claims he broke his council's code of conduct.

David Silvester, 73, was thrown out of the UK Independence Party and had his house egged after he made the claim in a letter to his local newspaper in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire.

Protesters attached a rainbow banner to his home and more than 25,000 people signed an online petition calling for him to resign.

Now it has emerged officials are investigating him after 12 people lodged formal complaints of councillor misconduct.

They claimed the Henley-on-Thames town councillor broke a 19-point code of conduct, which includes a clause that says councillors must treat other people with respect.

The investigation has been elevated to South Oxfordshire District Council - but if officials do decide he broke the code, the strongest punishment they can issue is a reprimand.

Councillor misconduct is an internal issue, not a criminal one, and they have no powers to suspend Cllr Silvester or remove him from office.

A spokesman for South Oxfordshire District Council said the investigation would take a minimum of a month and begin by the end of March.

'The investigator will judge the case against the precedents to consider whether the code of conduct applies in this case,' he added.

'If the code is deemed to have applied, the investigation will judge whether the councillor breached it.'

In the aftermath of the row in January, Henley-on-Thames council clerk Mike Kennedy issued a strongly-worded statement denying the council's involvement.

'The use of the council's name] has caused many residents of Henley and indeed further afield to conclude that the personal opinions expressed by Councillor Silvester in his letter are somehow associated with the views of Henley-on-Thames Town Council,' he said.

'This is not the case and the Town Council strongly refutes any suggestion to the contrary.'

Unrepentant: The 73-year-old would not apologise for his views and received 12 formal complaints

Ukip leader Nigel Farage was forced to intervene - expelling Cllr Silvester but defending his right to hold what he called 'barmy' views - after the party initially refused to take action.

The row was sparked after the 73-year-old wrote: 'The scriptures make it abundantly clear that a Christian nation that abandons its faith and acts contrary to the Gospel (and in naked breach of a coronation oath) will be beset by natural disasters such as storms, disease, pestilence and war.

Anger: The letter appeared in the Henley Standard

'I wrote to David Cameron in April 2012 to warn him that disasters would accompany the passage of his same-sex marriage bill.

'But he went ahead despite a 600,000-signature petition by concerned Christians and more than half of his own parliamentary party saying that he should not do so.

'It is his fault that large swathes of the nation have been afflicted by storms and floods.

'He has arrogantly acted against the Gospel that once made Britain "great" and the lesson surely to be learned is that no man or men, however powerful, can mess with Almighty God with impunity and get away with it for everything a nation does is weighed on the scaled of divine approval or disapproval.'

Speaking to MailOnline in January Cllr Silvester said he had quit the Tories over gay marriage.

He said: 'The Conservatives are known as the party of the Queen. The Queen in her coronation oath promised to only to pass those laws that are consistent with the Christian gospel.

'There is a command to love all men, and I hope I love all men, but we are also taught to love the person but hate the sin.'

When told hundreds of people thought he was crazy, he said: 'That may be so if you are not a person of prayer. I am a person of prayer. I pray for each member of the Cabinet every day and each member of the Royal family every day.'

Cllr Silvester remains on the town council as an independent member.

At a extraordinary meeting last month, he refused to apologise for his comments but did say he was was sorry for upsetting the gay community.
