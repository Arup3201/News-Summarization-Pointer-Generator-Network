A private Venetian Island north east of Venice, Italy, with a former Napoleonic fort transformed into a four-bedroom house, has been put on the market for £7.5m.

The picturesque island on the Venetian Lagoon is closest to Sant'Erasmo island, and well within striking distance of Burano, Mazzorbo and Torcello to the north and the city to the south.

The island's main residence is a unique red-brick property, previously the small fort, with three bathrooms and a large living room area while the garden looking onto the lagoon is well-established.

The private island, while secluded, is just 20 minutes by boat from Venice, say agents Vladi Private Islands

'The property is just 20 minutes’ boat ride from the bustle of Venice and a further 25 minutes away from the city’s airport,'  the listing agent Vladi Private Islands said.

'The main residence sprawls over 170m² and retains many of its original features.

'The property is truly something very special. Offering exquisite privacy without feeling isolated, the island is home to its own sheltered harbor and mooring facilities, meaning you can swap idyllic island life for the bright lights of the city in no time at all.' 

The island, along with the rest of Venice, was previously under Austrian control but was handed over to the Kingdom of Italy in 1866 by Prussian leader Otto von Bismark when Victor Emmanuel II struck up an alliance.

The island, which was turned into a fort during Napoleon's occupation of Venice, features red brick buildings

It was established as a Napoleonic fort at the close of the 18th century but was sold at the end of the 1800s to private owners, who turned the fort into a villa and a separate caretaker’s lodge.

'Air-conditioned, with a large living-room, four bedrooms, three bathrooms, a functioning kitchen and more, this Venetian island fort is very much something to fall in love with,' Vladi Private Islands' spiel continues. 

All of Venice's 118 islands and the lagoon are listed as a World Heritage Site.
