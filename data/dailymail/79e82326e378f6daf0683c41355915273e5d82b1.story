Gordon McQueeney, 77, bled to death in March after hemorrhaging during a biopsy operation 

A pensioner bled to death after medics failed to warn him to stop taking his blood-thinning medication before surgery.

Retired lorry driver Gordon McQueeney died in March after he haemorrhaged during a biopsy procedure.

Doctors were unable to stem the bleeding, and the 77-year-old great-great grandfather died later that day.

The father-of-seven was taking anti-platelet medication to thin his blood, which exacerbated the bleeding.

His widow Dorothy said she specifically asked nurses whether her husband should take his tablets as normal on the morning of his operation, and was told he could.

She has now criticised the NHS's offer of £14,000 compensation, branding it 'outrageous and disgusting'.

Hospital bosses have apologised for 'inadequacies' in Mr McQueeney's care.

Mrs McQueeney said doctors called her back to the hospital at 11am, three hours after he was admitted, and was told her husband was dying.

She said 12 members of their family watched him 'slip away' at his bedside at 5.50pm. 

The hospital wrote to Mrs McQueeney last week to apologise, and offer compensation.

The letter read: 'Your husband's anti-platelet medication was unknown to the clinicians prior to his referral for a liver biopsy and at the time of the procedure itself.

'The Trust acknowledges that this was not appropriate.

'The Trust would like to convey its most sincere apologies for the shortcomings identified during the inquest and within the Trust's own investigation.

'Please do be assured that the outcome of this investigation has led to changed practices within the Trust concerning knowledge of patients' medication prior to elective procedures such as biopsies.

'The Trust is confident that this will address the shortcomings identified and prevent similar occurrences in the future.'  

Mr McQueeney's bleed was exacerbated by anti-platelet medication he was taking to thin his blood, making it difficult for his blood to clot. His widow Dorothy McQueeney said she rang the hospital the morning of his operation to ask if he should still take his tablets, and was told he could

The father-of-seven was having a biopsy after doctors identified lesions on his liver and lung, which they feared could be cancerous

The 76-year-old widow, said: 'I think their offer is outrageous and disgusting and an insult to my family.

'His life is priceless to us. This is supposed to be a routine, everyday thing. His health was not the best but he was nowhere near dying.

'He walked in that morning and we left him with a cup of tea and newspaper, chatting to the nurses.

'We didn't think we would never speak to him again.'

She said she recalls calling the hospital before taking her husband in, to check on his medication. 

The Royal Bolton Hospital has apologised to Mrs McQueeney and offered her £14,000 compensation, which she branded 'outrageous and disgusting'

'I rang up the hospital and I said "is there a bed for my husband?" 

'She said yes. I said: "Should I give him his medication?" She said yes again.'

Doctors had identified lesions on Mr McQueeney's liver and lung, which they feared were cancerous.

They referred the 77-year-old for a biopsy.

All biopsies carry a risk of bleeding but the anti-platelet medication exacerbated the bleed, in Mr McQueeney's case.

Coroner Alan Walsh ruled at an inquest in September: 'Gordon McQueeney died as a consequence of intra-abdominal haemorrhage as a recognised complication of a liver biopsy.

'This was exacerbated by a complication of anti-platelet medication on a background of naturally occurring disease.' 

Mr McQueeney was father to Wendy, Belinda, Tracey, Jeanette, Paul, Geoffrey and Diane, and had 26 grandchildren, 16 great-grandchildren and one great-great grandchild.

A spokesman for the hospital said: 'The circumstances surrounding Mr McQueeney's death were tragic and it is understandable that his family are very upset. 

'They have our deep sympathy and apologies for their loss.

'We held a detailed investigation to examine the root causes and what lessons there were to be learned. 

'The report was shared with Mrs McQueeney and HM Area Coroner. 

'At the inquest into Mr McQueeney's death which was held on September 25 we shared with the coroner the actions we were taking in order to minimise the possibility of such an occurrence happening in future.

'We also apologised in court to the family.

'With regards to any financial compensation, claims are not dealt with by this trust but by the NHS Litigation Authority which negotiates the amount to be offered.'
