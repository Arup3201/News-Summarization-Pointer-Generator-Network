Kevin-Prince Boateng will never want to play for Ghana again after being sent home from the World Cup, according to Shalke chief.

The 27-year-old was expelled from the tournament after a heated exchange with Ghana coach James Kwesi Appiah - shortly after another player Sulley Muntari had been sent home for an alleged 'unprovoked physical attack' on a team official.

Boateng was 'suspended indefinitely' by the GhanaÂ  Football Association (GFA) on Friday - the same day that the team were eliminated from the World Cup after losing their final group game 2-1 to Portugal.

However, Heldt is confident that the incident will not adversely affect Boateng's performances for Schalke next season.

'I'm certain this World Cup and his suspension is not going to burden him,' he added.

'In fact, anybody who knows Boateng will know that he will actually be even more motivated by the whole thing.'
