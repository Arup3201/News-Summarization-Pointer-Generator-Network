David Cameron's daughter Nancy is set to attend a top state secondary school from September.

Staff at the Grey Coat Hospital academy, a short walk from Downing Street, have been told that the Prime Minister will be offered a place within weeks.

It would make Mr Cameron the first Tory premier while in power to send his child to a state school, which is also attended by Michael Gove's daughter.

David and Samantha Cameron hope to send their daughter Nancy, 10, to a state school and will hear the final decision in March

No final decision has yet been made on Nancy's future, and an official announcement is not due until March.

Like thousands of parents across the country, the Camerons are waiting to hear where they have been given a place.

Last year demand for secondary school places in London rose 5 per cent. Some 31 per cent of youngsters were rejected by their first choice school – up slightly on a year earlier.

Mr Cameron was famously educated at exclusive fee-paying Eton, something which is often used by his opponents as proof he is out of touch.

Mr Cameron and wife Samantha have sent Nancy, 10, and son Arthur, 7, to a Church of England primary school in Kensington.

Staff at Grey Coat, a girls' school in Westminster, have been told that Nancy will be enrolled, according to a report in the Sunday Times.

A source close to the Camerons sad: 'Like thousands of other parents, Mr and Mrs Cameron are in the process of applying for a secondary school place for their daughter. They will find out in the Spring which schools have offered her a place.'

Founded in 1698, the Greay Coat school specialises in the teaching of languages and encourages first year pupils to learn at least two, with the option of studying Latin and Greek.

Judged 'outstanding' by Ofsted in 2009, the school, which has strong links with Westminster Abbey, is typically at least five times oversubscribed for its 150 places.

It places pupils in ability bands to allocate places as well as prioritising church-going families.

The uniform at the school includes a grey coat, as the name suggests, costing between £65 and £85.

According to the 2009 report, two-thirds of pupils are from ethnic minority backgrounds and one third speak English as a second language.

In March last year tens of thousands of ten and 11-year-olds found they had missed out as allocations were announced by councils across the country.

Many areas reported a rise in the number of applicants and a corresponding decline in the number of pupils being assigned their first choice schools.

In the London boroughs of Westminster and Hammersmith & Fulham 42 per cent missed out on their first choice with 41 per cent in Wandsworth.

In Bristol, the population of secondary school age youngsters shot up 8 per cent, leaving 23 per cent of children without their first choice school – compared with 18 per cent in 2013.

Michael Gove, then Education Secretary, last year sent his daughter Beatrice to Grey Coat. His wife Sarah Vine, a Daily Mail columnist, said at the time: 'Let's be clear: the Grey Coat Hospital (in Westminster) is not exactly Sinkhouse High.'

She added: 'I want to support the state sector not just because, as a UK taxpayer and a tight-wad, I would resent paying twice for my children's education.

'Or because, having watched my friends go through the hell of trying to get their offspring into high-flying private schools, I decided to spare mine the anguish.

'But mostly because I believe that at state school Beatrice will receive a far more comprehensive education - in every sense of the phrase - than at any private establishment.'

Grey Coat Hospital admits 151 girls a year into year 7 (age 11) from ‘within the full age range of ability and from a wide range of backgrounds’.

Up to 15 places are offered to girls solely on the strength of their ‘aptitude for languages’.

Up to 80 places will be given to girls from practising Church of England families living within the dioceses of London and Southwark – and must be supported by a clergy reference. Then up to 28 places are given to families active in other churches, which must also be backed up by a reference.

Applicants are ranked according to their church commitment with marks for having a parent who holds elected church office, and regular attendance of church services and Sunday school.

The rest of the places, up to 28, are ‘open places’ with no religious criteria.
