The house where schoolgirl April Jones was believed to be murdered is set to be razed to the ground.

The Welsh Government has bought the detached cottage in Ceinws, near Machynlleth, mid Wales, where child killer Mark Bridger took the five-year-old.

Since the 2012 killing, the property has served as a grim reminder of the tragedy - with April's parents Coral and Paul leading the calls for its demolition.

Scene: The house where April Jones was murdered will be torn down by the Welsh government after her parents pleaded for the heart-breaking reminder of their tragedy to go

Murder: Bridger, 48, abducted April as she played with friends near her home on the Bryn Y Gog estate in Machynlleth on October 1, 2012

A Welsh Government spokesman said: 'After discussions with the family, the Welsh Government has purchased the property connected to death of April Jones.

'The Welsh Government will now work with the local authority, the Jones family and the local community for the most appropriate future for the site - following demolition of the the property.'

It is believed the Labour administration in Cardiff Bay have brokered a deal worth £149,000 with the owner of the cottage - which was rented by Bridger. The price paid is thought to be the 2008 market value of the house.

April's parents Coral and Paul led the calls for the house to be demolished

Bridger, 48, abducted April as she played with friends near her home on the Bryn Y Gog estate in Machynlleth on October 1, 2012.

Detectives believe the former lifeguard dismembered the primary school pupil's body at his rented cottage before going on to dispose of her remains at numerous locations around the countryside.

News that the house has been bought by the Welsh Government has been welcomed by April's family.

A statement by her parents on Facebook read: 'This is a huge weight off our minds.

'The loss of our beautiful daughter was bad enough, but the house has been a constant reminder of the tragic events.

'Our family want to thank the Welsh Government for listening to us and for understanding our need to see the house demolished.'
