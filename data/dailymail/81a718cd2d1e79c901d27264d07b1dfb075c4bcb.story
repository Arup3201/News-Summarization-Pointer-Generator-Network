An Iraqi soldier has revealed his incredible survival story after being lined up for execution by an ISIS firing squad - only for the gun-wielding jihadi to miss him by a matter of millimeters.   

Ali Hussein Kadhim, a Shiite Iraqi soldier, was safely back home with his wife and young children in southern Iraq this week after being one of hundreds abducted by the extremist Sunni militants in Tikrit in June.

While his Sunni Iraqi colleagues were spared death,  Mr Kadhim - a Shiite Iraqi soldier - was ordered to be executed.

Safe return: Ali Hussein Kadhim with his son and daughter at his family's date orchard in Diwaniya, south Iraq this week

Ali Hussein Kadhim, a Shiite Iraqi soldier, pictured on Wednesday, was one of hundreds abducted by the extremist group in Tikrit, Iraq in June

Playing dead: Mr Kadhim, 23, has identified himself (circled in the picture from June) in this footage released by ISIS of their 'victims' after abducting and murdering hundreds of Shiite Iraqi soldiers. Incredibly, Mr Kadhim survived

After shooting three Shiite soldiers in the back of the head, the assassin turned his gun on 23-year-old Mr Kadhim - and missed.

Instinctively, the soldier fell forwards into an open grave dug for the victims of the murderous rampage. It was a decision that would save his life.

Speaking to the New York Times on Wednesday, Mr Kadhim, who is married with a daughter and baby son, described the sensation of the bullet breezing past his temple.

Mr Kadhim lay still among the bodies for hours as he waited for the ISIS extremists to leave. He then fled the bloody scene under cover of darkness and hid out by the Tigris River, a few hundred yards away. He spent three days on the run, eating plants to survive. 

'I saw my daughter in my mind saying "Father, father",' he told the newspaper from his home in southern Iraq. 'I just pretended to be shot'. 

After waiting hours for the ISIS fighters to leave, Mr Kadhim (pictured this week) spent three days on the run after escaping execution 

Horrific: The militant group has posted a number of slick images, like this photograph on June 14, of them leading Iraqis to their deaths

After ISIS released sickening images of their victims lying face-down in the dirt with their hands bound behind their backs, Mr Kadhim managed to identify himself in the line-up.

ISIS released the slickly-produced, disturbing footage of the siege on the Islamic religious holiday of Eid earlier this year.

The video showed prisoners being rounded up and summarily executed, suicide bombers boasting before blowing up buildings and Iraqis being gunned down in drive-by shootings.

In one of the most shocking segments, terrified prisoners are piled into the back of trucks, where they hold each other and huddle in fear before being driven off to their deaths.

The 36-minute film then cuts to dozens of prisoners lying face down on the ground, hands bound behind their backs, waiting to be executed. 

'I wanted to live': Mr Kadhim, who is now reunited with his wife and young children, said he kept thinking of his family as he lay among other Shiite Iraqis waiting to be executed

It is in that final shot that Mr Kadhim saw himself, trying to act lifeless with the blood of another soldier splattered across his face.

He is one of the only known survivors of the murderous rampage at the hands of Islamic State militants as they claimed Tikrit two months ago.

The group now  controls an estimated four million people. The siege in June was a key turning point in the group's invasion into Iraq from Syria. 

Mr Kadhim's chilling first-hand account of ISIS's well-documented brutality came as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry issued a dramatic call to arms against the extremists today, urging world leaders to join a 'core coalition' to end their murderous rampage through Iraq, but ruled out putting 'boots on the ground'. 

And in what could prove not just a major turning point in the war against ISIS but also an unprecedented sea-change in America's relations with Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei today answered Kerry's call from Tehran, ordering his army to fight shoulder-to-shoulder with U.S., Kurdish and Iraqi forces against the extremist horde.
