Traveller Percy Smith, 43, of Ryedale Caravan Site in Yorkshire has been jailed after admitting drug dealing and money laundering

A drug-dealing traveller who claimed benefits while living a life of luxury on the back of his illegal trade has been sent to prison.

Unemployed Percy Smith, 43, had a fleet of brand new vehicles worth £77,000, £2,500 cash, large deposits in the bank and lived what police called an 'indulgent' lifestyle when he was arrested at the caravan site he lived on in Yorkshire.

Officers raided three caravans and seized a Audi A3 S-Line, a Ford Fiesta Zetec S, a Ford Focus ST-2 and a Ford Transit van, which would have cost £9,000 a year alone to insure.

They also found evidence of cannabis cultivation, £3,000-worth of heroin, split into smaller quantities, and £2,500 in cash which Smith was unable to explain.

Smith was jailed at York Crown Court for three years and nine months after admitting conspiracy to supply cannabis and heroin, and one charge of money laundering. He now faces a proceeds of crime hearing.

The court heard that police raided Smith's home at Ryedale Caravan Site on the outskirts of York for the first time in June 2011, when they found evidence of cannabis farming as well as £5,805 cash.

While Smith's only official income was state benefits, including Jobseeker's Allowance, officers also discovered that large amounts of cash were being deposited in his bank accounts and those of close relatives.

Further searches uncovered 67.5grams of heroin with a street value of £3,000, four new vehicles, £2,514 cash, and receipts for luxury items including three crystal wine glasses which Smith had bought for £700, and an array of Apple devices including iPhones, iPods and an iPad, all of which had been paid for in cash.

Officers, who also found £1,800 proceeds of crime at another caravan belonging to an associate of Smith's, said he clearly had an 'indulgent' lifestyle way beyond his means.

Smith was sentenced yesterday and a proceeds of crime hearing will take place in October.

Richard John 
Miner, 47, from London, was given a 12-month jail term, suspended for 
two years, for his part in the illegal set-up.

This brand new Audi A3 S-line was found at Smith's caravan when police executed a search warrant there

Seized: This new Ford Focus car was taken by officers during one of several raids on his home in Yorkshire

Another one: Officers who took this brand new Ford Fiesta said that Smith lived way beyond his (official) means

And another one: This Ford Transit van was taken from the traveller's home, one of his brand new, £77,000 fleet

Acting Sgt Toby Gorwood of North Yorkshire Police said: 'Percy Smith was well supported by the state but undertook criminal activities over a significant period of time with the sole aim of financing a materialistic and self-indulgent lifestyle he could not otherwise afford.

'He selfishly fuelled drug abuse in York and the associated criminality which comes with it. This is something which is abhorrent to law abiding people who work hard for their living.'

Det Con Adam Heatlie who led the drugs investigation, said: 'Organised and coordinated crime of this nature will not be tolerated within the communities.'
