It is now official: when it comes to swimming naked, no one does it better - or at least in bigger numbers - than Australians.

On Sunday, a group of brave, brazen Aussies took part in a mass-skinny dip at a Perth Beach, successfully setting a new Guinness World Record for the largest group 'nude swim'.

Although it is yet to be officially confirmed, it's understood that the team at Fremantle's South Beach surpassed New Zealand's standing record of 749, thanks to around 790 swimmers in the nuddy. 

All skinny dippers had to stay in the water together for at least five minutes, with all competitors required to be submerged at least to their waists.

The 2015 Naked Fig Skinny Dip Challenge also raised an estimated $10,000 for The Butterfly Foundation to support people with eating disorders and negative body image.

Devastating statistics prove the toll of negative body image as almost 2000 people die from eating disorders every year.

Additionally, around one million Australians must struggle with disordered eating and harmful thoughts about their appearance every single day.

The event was the perfect way to encourage people to embrace their bodies and be happy within themselves. 

It was a day 'to celebrate diversity and health', with many couples, families and friends hitting the sand together. 

'In my 23 years of existence, I have never felt as accepted and as comfortable as I did today, standing naked with 790 people,' said participant Sarah Jimmy.

'If I had been given this experience as a teenager, to see everyone as they are, and to realise just how different and beautiful everyone is in the own way, it would have saved me from years of self doubt.

'Everyone had a smile on their face.'  

Teams of people took to the shore wearing little more than body paint, ready for a day of fun.

Those that took part were ecstatic, raving about the liberation they felt splashing around.

'I don't skinny dip - I chunky dunk!' a participant said proudly, without a hint of self-consciousness.

'Such a great day! Awesome turnout, the whole 'vibe' of the day was so much fun!' said Mitch Barrows.

'See you all next year when we beat our own record!' 

'There were people of all shapes and sizes having such a great day,' said event organiser Lorna Marns. 

'Some were very hesitant and nervous at the beginning but after they stripped off and ran into the water they forgot about their concerns and bobbed around in the water happily.'

The inspirational ambassador for the challenge was Jessica Smith, a Paralympian and award-winning spokeswoman for positive body image.

The city of Fremantle were fully onboard with the fundraiser, officially reserved the beach for those taking part to ensure privacy. 

'The councillors were so wonderful. They were really open-minded to the idea. It was so enjoyable to enjoyable to work with council who were open to embrace new idea and charitable events.'

No other approved phones or cameras were allowed on the beach for the sake of privacy. 

The event also promised to be a 'creep-free zone'.

However, beautiful aerial photos were taken at long-range to capture the carefree moment the throng ran into the ocean.  

The first ever Skinny Dip Challenge was held in 2014 and was marred by cold, windy conditions which left a few too nervous to drop their dacks. 

'We couldn't have asked for more different or better conditions than we had last year. It was 32, 33 degrees and just spectacular,' said Ms Marns.

'We did supply a lot of sunscreen which was very necessary!'

'What a fabulous day to get naked!' remarked one of the skinny dippers. 

'The Skinny Dip Challenge' raised money for charity but was also a fantastic event for those wanting the opportunity to frolic in their birthday suit. 

'It feels good to skinny dip – seriously, how long has it been since you last had a nudie swim?' the organisers had implored people before the event. 

'You can get naked in public without being arrested,' they joked. 

The funds raised will go towards supporting to counsellors, research programs, workshops and school programs. 

'In a society where so much focus is put on how we look and the size and shape that we are, the Butterfly Foundation strives to change this perception as well as what is promoted in health policy and practice,' said the event organisers. 

Ms Jimmy was moved by the experience. 

'With the barrier of clothing removed, everyone could laugh and talk freely amongst each other. Bonded in our own private experience,' she said.

'There were no strangers by the end of the event.'
