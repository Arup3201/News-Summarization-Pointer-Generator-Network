For a wedding that's truly out of this world, why not think outside the box when it comes to venues, like this pair of sci-fi fanatics?

The couple shunned traditional venues, deciding instead to get married somewhere that reflected their passion for all things space-related.

Sarah Young, 25, and Jason Olson, 38, tied the knot at the Chabot Space and Science Centre, near their home in San Francisco, USA.

As these entertaining pictures by photographer Sonia Savio reveal, the pair enjoyed posing by telescopes and even riding space probes on their big day.

Jason, who works as operations director for Architecture For Humanity, played around with paraphernalia and tried on an astronaut's helmet.

Sarah, an opera singer, said some of the guests were surprised at their choice of venue.

She said: 'No one else I know has a wedding photo on top of a rocket. I couldn't be happier.

'We are equally space mad, we love science and are huge science fiction fans.

'Our mutual love of Star Trek was the primary subject of our first date. He is a next generation fan, I prefer the original series. We are also huge Dr. Who and Torchwood fans.

'We started out looking at more traditional wedding venues, golf courses, gardens and such, but found them boring and uninspiring.

'We wanted something that would reflect who we are. On my birthday the year before our wedding we happened to attend Chabot - one of our favorite museums - and thought, "Hey I wonder if they do weddings?"

Sarah said: 'I suspect some of our friends and family thought we were a little crazy when we first announced the location.

'Once there I think people were surprised at how elegant and touching a space wedding could be.

'Here I have to acknowledge my man of honour Jefferson Taylor, who not only sang at our wedding, but was responsible for a lot of the look and design.

'The planetarium show took us from the earth to the far reaches of the galaxy accompanied by live classical music and our personal vows.

'Many people said it was the most touching wedding they had ever seen. After the emotional ceremony we put a smile on peoples facing by exiting the building to the Star Wars theme tune.

'Then at the reception we were able to let loose and dance and play amongst the science exhibits.

'People absolutely loved it, they are still raving about it to this day. And when the pictures came out our friends and family thought they were stunning.

Sarah and Jason took their honeymoon at the Mayan Rivera in Mexico where they climbed temples and swam in the ocean.
