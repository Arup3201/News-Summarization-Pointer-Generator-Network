A father-of-one is fighting for his life in hospital after a backyard firework exploded in his face during New Year's Eve celebrations. 

Adrian Alafaci, 28, was at Sans Souci in Sydney's south with friends and family on the coast when tragedy struck.

Alafaci, the father of a little girl, suffered horrific facial and head injuries.

He remains in a critical condition at St George's Hospital following the serious accident which occurred when he attempted to light a firecracker. 

Just after 12am on New Year's Day police were called to Sans Souci in Sydney's south following reports of a man injured on the beach. 

Police told Daily Mail Australia 'he's not well at all' after Alafaci suffered facial and head injuries.

NSW Police media ‘could not confirm that a home made firework was  used during the incident, as that information forms part of the ongoing investigation.’

Bob Buffoni, a resident who lives on Riverside Drive overlooking the beach, heard and saw the distressing accident.

“We heard the bang and the flash together, it was really loud,' he told news.com.au

He described the pandemonium, with people running and screaming, calling for ambulances and explaining that 'there is so much blood'.

He insists it had now been a troublesome party before the incident. 

Another neighbour, Angela Lirantzis, describes seeing 'the guy being taken on a stretcher in a bad way.'

Relatives were screaming that he had been burnt.  

Meanwhile, police are investigating after a 21-year-old man also suffered facial injuries from a firework explosion in a separate incident on New Year's Eve on NSW's Central Coast.
