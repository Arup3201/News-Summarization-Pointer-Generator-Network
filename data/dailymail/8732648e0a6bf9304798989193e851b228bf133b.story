Heavily pregnant Nadia Avila (pictured) was butchered with a kitchen knife by Maria Rodriguez in Tepic, Mexico, according to police confession

A Mexican woman has confessed to stabbing an eight-months pregnant mother in the stomach with a kitchen knife so she could steal her unborn baby from the womb, according to police.

In a graphic confession, Maria Rodriguez, 29, from Tepic, Mexico, told police she decided to kill Nadia Avila and remove her baby after lying to her family about being pregnant.

She will now appear in court on two charges of murder, for the baby and the baby's mother, according to police.

In the chilling video confession Rodriguez says she first beat her victim unconscious after luring her to her home in Tepic with a promise of free baby clothes.

She said: 'When I covered her mouth, she bit me and then I took her hands behind her back to defend myself, but I did not kill her then.

'She was shouting, asking me to leave her in peace. Then I beat her again and she fell to the ground unconscious and then I opened her stomach.

'I just lowered her trousers and stabbed her stomach. She reacted a bit in that moment, but just a bit. 

'I held her arms down and I took the baby as soon as I could in order to take the baby before it suffocated.

'But I could not take the baby. I tried but it was impossible and the baby came out dead.'

Rodriguez told police she was 'obsessed' with having a baby and did not know how to admit to her family that she was not pregnant.

'I had a delayed period and I checked my blood but the results were negative,' said Rodriguez.

'I was obsessed with having a baby and all my family thought I was pregnant. But this was a lie and I did not know how to get out of it. I thought there was nothing I could say, but when I saw her I thought about this idea.

'I did not know anything about her, I had just seen her twice.'

'When I saw her stomach it came to mind to do this, how I could manage to end the lie. And it came to my mind to steal her baby in order to continue the lie,' said Rodriguez.

She explained to police that she saw Ms Avila several times when the pregnant woman was taking her son to school.

On the day she approached and killed her, Ms Avila was going to the school to attend a meeting.

'When I saw her stomach it came to mind to do this, how I could manage to end the lie. And it came to my mind to steal her baby in order to continue the lie.

Ms Avila with her husband Juan Hernandez, who notified police in Mexico that she was missing  

'We started to talk and I asked her how long she was pregnant and what the baby will be, if it was a girl or a boy, and she told me she was going to have the baby in just days, and it came to my mind to do it.'

Rodriguez was caught when she called paramedics to take the baby to hospital, so she could tell her family it had arrived stillborn.

'They were immediately suspicious of her story but she would not let them into the house where her victim's body was,' said a police spokesman.

Rodriguez fled when medics insisted on examining her but was arrested after her victim's husband Juan Hernandez reported her missing.

Police connected the disappearance to the suspicious birth and tracked down Rodriguez who had gone into hiding.

'The suspect has made a full confession to a shocking, terrible crime and will appear in court on two charges of murder, for the baby and the baby's mother,' said police. 

Police Officer: Why have you been arrested?

Rodriguez: 'For homicide. I had a delayed period and I checked my blood but the results were negative. I was obsessed with having a baby and all my family thought I was pregnant. 

'But this was a lie and I did not know how to get out of it. I thought there was nothing I could say, but when I saw her I thought about this idea.

'I did not know anything about her, I had just seen her twice.

'I was in the school and she was also. I went out and she went out as well. We were talking during the way to the entrance door and when I saw her stomach it came to mind to do this, how I could manage to end the lie. And it came to my mind to steal her baby in order to continue the lie.

'We started to talk and I asked her how long she was pregnant and what the baby will be, if it was a girl or a boy, and she told me she was going to have the baby in just days, and it came to my mind to do it.

'There was a meeting in the school but we continued talking and I told her I had some stuff to give her for the baby and she accompanied me to my house.

'When we were in the house I beat her and she tried to defend herself.

'I threw her to the ground and covered her mouth to prevent her from screaming. When I covered her mouth, she bit me and then I took her hands behind her back to defend myself, but I did not kill her then.

'She was shouting asking me to leave her in peace. Then I beat her again and she fell to the ground unconscious and then I opened her stomach.

'I just lowered her trousers and stabbed her stomach. She reacted a bit in that moment, but just a bit.

'I held her arms down and I took the baby as soon as I could in order to take the baby before it suffocated. But I could not take the baby. I tried but it was impossible and the baby came out dead.

'Then the mother died and I took the baby. I felt horror but I realised I could not stop because I had attacked her and the fear made me to continue.

'The knife is in the courtyard, where I lived. It was a knife I usually use to cook and it was sharp.

'In that moment, the only thing I was thinking is to have a baby with me. I called the ambulance to help the baby but it was dead.

'When the ambulance arrived, I was very nervous and they took me and the baby to the nearest hospital to be treated. I did not want to be treated and they told me the baby was dead. And then I escaped.

'The days I was hiding I was thinking how I could go back and not to do anything. But it was impossible to go back. I know I have hurt a lot of people and her family.

'I know they are not going to forgive what I did. I cannot tell them anything. I have no words. I feel bad.'
