Stephanie Adams, 27, was left unable to get into her Vauxhall Corsa after this shocking piece of parking in Nottingham

The driver of the Audi A5 left the vehicle just millimetres from her white coloured Vauxhall Corsa

Stephanie said that she could not climb in through the passenger door because of her child's car seat

The driver of the Audi made sure they had plenty of space to get in and out of their vehicle on the drivers side.

'When I left the car there was a space next to it, but when I came back the car was parked like this,' said the 27-year-old, who was delayed collecting her daughter from nursery. 

'My first thought was ''how am I going to get out?'' but then I thought ''how am I going to get in?''  

'The car was parked so close to my mine I couldn't get in, and I didn't think I'd be able to climb over the child seat which is in the passenger seat.

'But even if I did get into the car, I'm not sure I would have been able to reverse out of there anyway.'

When the driver of the navy blue 2007 Audi A5 Sport TDI Quattro finally moved his car, there was no damage to her vehicle.

The incident happened at the Lace Market car park in Nottingham on February 12.

The mother-of-one was also worried about the damaging the Audi if she tried to reverse out

The mother-of-one said: 'My first thought was 'how am I going to get out?' but then I thought 'how am I going to get in?'

'Strangely enough I think I actually bumped into the driver who was having trouble with his ticket at the machine,' said the photography student.

'He was about 25 and wearing a suit. He looked a bit flash but I let him go ahead of me because I was waiting for an attendant so I could show him how the Audi had parked.

'When the attendant arrived we went up the stairs to my car and the Audi had gone. The only person I had seen was the guy in the suit so I assume it must have been his car.

'I was amazed there was no damage to either car but it shows just how thoughtless some people can be.

'I put the picture on my Facebook page and hundreds of people have commented on it. The response has been incredible.'

The MailOnline has been contacted by a man claiming to be the driver of the Audi.

He said: 'My car was only parked in that position next to the car for a matter of minutes whilst I went to the newsagents.'

He declined to comment on the incident further.
