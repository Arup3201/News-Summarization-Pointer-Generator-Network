For most owners, the thought of losing their beloved pet is unimaginable.

But for some, such a crisis appears to evoke creativity, humour and even a desperation to lose them for good.

These hilarious photos show missing pet signs that have been put up by owners and members of the public across the world.

Have you seen me? Klaus the dog is described as being a 'very, very crazy' - with an increased hostility now he is 'off his medication'. Unsurprisingly then, he is pictured bounding into the air with his tongue hanging out

Cat found! Another poster shows an evil-looking creature that is quite clearly not a feline pictured under the words: 'CAT FOUND!!! The caption reads: 'Not very friendly. I think she might be scared. Not house broken either.'

'No questions asked': One sign even depicts a lost chicken - with members of the public offered a cash reward

They feature dogs, cats, birds and even spiders that are either lost of found, as well as some more questionable looking creatures.

One sign shows a missing dog called Klaus, who is described as being a 'very, very crazy' - with an increased hostility now he is 'off his medication'.

Unsurprisingly then, the animal is pictured bounding into the air with his front legs splayed widely and his tongue dangling out of his mouth.

The accompanying caption reads: 'He will literally attempt to rip your face off. In fact, I don't want him back. Just call animal control and let them deal with it.'

Puppy found! The amusing images, which were mostly captured in America, were posted to a number of online blogs, including The Chive, Urlesque and Oddee. Above, a missing 'puppy' who is described as being 'unfriendly'

'Killer': A lost dog - who is prone to being 'irate' - is pictured snarling at the camera. He is likely to alarm any member of the public who stumbles across him - and even more so when they realise he is called 'Killer'

Bizarree: These missing pet signs feature a seemingly obese dog (left) and a beloved crab called Oliver (right)

Meanwhile, 
another poster shows an evil-looking creature that is quite clearly not a
 feline pictured under the words: 'CAT FOUND!!!'

The
 animal can be seen glaring at the camera, while the caption reads: 'Not
 very friendly. I think she might be scared. Not house broken either.'

One
 sign even depicts a missing pet chicken - with the embarrassed owner 
informing members of the public: 'Cash reward. No questions asked'.

Don't be fooled!': An adorable lost puppy is described by his owners as 'vicious' and a 'blood-thirsty monster'

Reward: A ginger cat's owner is clearly unable to cope any longer as he offers a reward (left) to members of the public who find the animal - but do not return him. Meanwhile, an alpaca called Dexter is also missing (right)

And another features a missing white dog who goes by the unfortunate name of 'Douche Mouth'.

The amusing images, which were mostly captured in America, were posted to a number of online blogs, including The Chive, Urlesque and Oddee.

Among them are a missing dog staring directly at the camera with wide eyes, a lost crab named Oliver, a cat with six toes, a tarantula who 'likes playing hide and seek' and an adorable puppy who is apparently a 'blood-thirsty monster'.

'Worrying': This sign shows a missing tarantula called Conrad, who is 'very friendly' and 'likes hide and seek'

Treasured: A missing bird enjoys singing 'The Andy Griffith Show' song (left), while a lost cat has six toes (right)

One poster shows a lost dog - who is prone to being 'irate' and 'unfriendly' - snarling at the camera with his razor-sharp teeth on display.

He is likely to alarm any member of the public who stumbles across him - and even more so when they realise he 'answers to the name "Killer".'

Meanwhile, another sign features a missing ginger cat who apparently 'tears up furniture' and 'craps everywhere'.

'Gay dog': This poster, put up by a member of the public, features a 'gay dog' who 'won't stop humping' another

Amusing: Two less believable signs feature a missing dog AND wife (left), and a lion known as 'Tiddles' (right)

His owner is clearly unable to cope any longer - offering a reward to members of the public who find the animal, but do not return him.

And a less believable poster features a photo of a male lion, who is described as being an '800lb cat' with 'orange fur' and a 'big fluffy head'.

According to the sign, the animal answers to either 'Tiddles' or 'Aaaarrgghhh'.
