New Zealand scrum-half Aaron Smith believes the pain of succumbing to his only defeat in an All Blacks shirt against England will fuel his performance in tomorrow's first Test at Eden Park.

Smith and his fellow world champions were thrashed 38-21 at Twickenham in December 2012 - a record defeat against England.

The All Blacks avenged that loss with a 30-22 victory in last year's November international but Smith still carries the scars of his solitary reversal for New Zealand from 26 caps.

The 25-year-old said: 'England showed a lot of fire in that game. I still have clear memories of that day. It's quite painful still.

'It's still there to fuel to me - the way it happened. They blew us away in the end.

'I learned from that game, that it's not about trying to win the game early.

'It's a general big-time Test match where you try and win as many moments as you can.

'It was a lot better in the second game and we showed them a lot more respect.

'Everyone thought "oh God no" when England went ahead but we had to trust our plan and we got the win which was really good.'

Smith is relishing the opportunity to finally play England on home soil having faced them at Twickenham twice, one of which was New Zealand's only loss since winning the World Cup in 2011.

'England are really a dangerous animal and still have the brute size that their sides always do,' he said.

'They play with a lot of width and like playing footie. It's refreshing to see because it's an exciting brand of rugby.

'We're playing in our home ground for once. I've played them twice and it's not too much fun at Twickenham.

'That's their place, they like to play there and it will be nice to play them in a place I like to play as well.

'Eden Park's a good ground and there should be fireworks in a sense and hopefully we're making the bigger bangs.'

- The All Blacks have not lost a Test at Eden Park in 20 years.

- They have won 31 successive Tests on the ground.

- Only Wales are unbeaten at Eden Park - and that is mainly because they have never played there.
