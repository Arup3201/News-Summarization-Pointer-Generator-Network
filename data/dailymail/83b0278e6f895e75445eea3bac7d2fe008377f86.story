A woman who was unable to leave the house for 14 years due to depression, is finally on the road to recovery.

Linda Haberfield, now 60, from Southampton, became depressed while going through a divorce in 1991 and was so stressed, her hair began falling out.

Too embarrassed to leave the house thanks to her non-existent locks, Ms Haberfield became a recluse for more than a decade but has now regained her confidence following a pioneering hair treatment.

Ms Haberfield's problems began during her divorce which, although amicable, left her the single mother of two young children.

That, combined with a high pressure job and a diabetes diagnosis, resulted in a seriously stressed Ms Haberfield falling prey to depression. 

Although referred to a psychiatrist, her experience was not a happy one with the mother-of-two passed from medic to medic and prescribed an increasingly lengthy list of medication.

'Because I was only able to see registrars (people training to be psychiatrists), I would see a new person every year.

'They would ask the same questions over and over which would open up the wounds again. I was trapped in a cycle.'

Things became worse when the resulting stress, coupled with her severe depression, left her hair falling out in clumps.

Hospitalised following a heart attack the following year. Ms Haberfield found herself unable work but was turned down when she applied for benefits.

'It was both financially and emotionally devastating,' said the former Tachograph Inspector, who says it was around then that she hit 'rock bottom'.

'All I did was cleaning,' she remembers. 'it was something to keep me busy as I couldn’t get out the house and it kept my mind occupied.'

In 2000, she met her future husband Jeff, who was immensely supportive, taking care of both her, and her two young sons. 

'He helped me emotionally as he was the only one at the time who could put up with what I was giving out,' she says.

'He also financially supported me, and was just there for absolutely anything I needed.'

Her mother and sons also proved supportive and it was her mother who happened upon the hair treatment that has helped to restore her confidence.

After some convincing, Ms Haberfield agreed to see hair loss specialist Simone Thomas, who created a bespoke hair replacement system.

Five weeks after starting treatment, her hair began to grow back and according to Ms Haberfield, she finally began to feel like herself again. 

Indeed, so dramatic has the transformation been, Ms Haberfield is finally leaving the house on a regular basis once more - something she had not done for 14 years.

'Linda is a beautiful person with an amazing, kind, warm personality,' explains Thomas. 'To help this much in her life is truly an honour. 

'We fitted Linda with a bespoke Hair Replacement System with real hair which Linda is able to treat and wash as if it were her own hair. 

'Although we have not known Linda long the whole team truly loves Linda and it is a pleasure to work with her.

'While tackling depression is an uphill battle, Linda now has a renewed fighting spirit and has now booked to go to Las Vegas, Los Angeles and the Caribbean.
