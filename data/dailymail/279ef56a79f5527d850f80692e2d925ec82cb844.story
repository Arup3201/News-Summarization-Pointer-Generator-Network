Heartbreaking: Michael Russell was stabbed to death in the backyard of his home suffering more than 12 wounds - Jae Williams and Randy Thompson are facing murder charges for the 2009 crime

The anguished wails of an uncle desperately trying to save his nephew who had been viciously stabbed were played to stunned silence in a San Jose court on Tuesday.

So distressing were the pleas of Thomas Russell for his 15-year-old nephew Michael Russell to 'come back, please come back to me' heard on the 911 call - that jurors broke down in tears.

The short tape was played by the prosecution on the first day of the murder trial of Jae Williams, who is accused along with another man of being a Satanist who befriended Russell in November 2009 just to kill him for the 'sheer thrill of it.'

Both Williams and Randy Thompson, who are now 20, are accused of stabbing Michael to death in his own San Jose backyard with a kitchen knife belonging to Thompson's mother.

The pair are being tried separately as adults after Williams told police in the aftermath of the killing that he worshiped the Devil and had already beaten a cat to death.

Williams also told police that Thompson was very keen to make his 'first human kill' and the alleged killers were so close that they had exchanged rings and given each other morbid nicknames - 'Grimm' and 'Goure'.

'I guess I just finally wanted to kill somebody,' Williams told detectives two days after the November 2009 murder according to a transcript of the interview. 'I had my chance and I took it.'

The shocking murder occurred at Michael Russell's home while his mother had left to shop at Target in the early evening.

Williams and Thompson came round to smoke marijuana, having already selected that day to kill their fellow teen.

The court heard how the two teenagers tackled him and pinned him down while they began to calmly stab him.

Harrowingly, Russell, who believed the boys were his friends, initially thought they were joking according to the alleged confession Williams gave to the police.

'He was on the floor and he was yelling a little bit,' Williams said according to Mercury News, 'like telling us ... 'Come on, guys.'

Williams allegedly told police the attack continued for six minutes and culminated in them slitting the teens throat.

Williams listened while the 911 tape was played to the court who heard Thomas Russell plead with his nephew to stay with him on speaker phone, while the sound of him compressing Michael's chest was audible.

'He's been stabbed, oh my God, please, somebody help me,' Thomas Russell cried as the 911 operator tried to calm him to get an accurate address. 'Come on, son ... no ... no ... Michael, come back.'

Michael was stabbed more than 12 times, one wound punctured his larynx, jugular vein and cartoid artery, while another caused his right lung to collapse.

The sheer force of the attack meant another of his wounds was a seven-inch deep stab wound to into his heart and his hands were cut as he tried to defend himself.

'Jae Williams and another boy -- cloaked in friendship -- went to Michael Russell's house and unleashed a ferocious attack,' said prosecutor Valerie McGuire.

McGuire told the court that DNA evidence and the alleged confession from Williams after police were tipped-off he was involved will provide enough evidence to convict.

'He is guilty beyond any reasonable doubt,' she said according to Mercury News.

In another tragic detail, Santa Clara County pathologist Dr. Joseph O'Hara testified to the court that Michael didn't bleed much because his wounds were so devastating his heart was unable to pump anymore.

Williams, who was 15 at the time of the November 10 attack, allaegedly bragged to police in a confession of sorts after his arrest.

He said that they took a knife from Thompson's house and after the killing wrapped it in discarded clothing and hid it between two cars in his driveway.

The prosecution allege the recovered knife is smeared with Michael Russell's blood.

Authorities also recovered Williams and Thompson's sweatshirts from bushes nearby to the knife - which also have the murdered teens DNA on them.
