The White House wanted Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner to lie on Sunday talk shows to downplay the part Social Security played in driving the deficit, it was revealed today.

Geithner writes in his memoir Stress Test, out today, that the White House communications director asked him to downplay the long term cost of Social Security spending to mollify the Democratic Party's base.

'I remember during one Roosevelt Room prep session before I appeared on the Sunday shows, I objected when Dan Pfeiffer wanted me to say Social Security didn't contribute to the deficit. It wasn't a main driver of our future deficits, but it did contribute,' he says.

'Pfeiffer said the line was a 'dog whistle' to the left, a phrase I had never heard before. He had to explain that the phrase was code to the Democratic base, signaling that we intended to protect Social Security.'

Geithner's book release comes amidst allegations that the White House changed the Sunday show talking points of U.S. ambassador to 
the U.N. Susan Rice's after the September 11, 2012 attack in 
Benghazi, Libya for political reasons.

Days after the White House claims it knew what happened in Benghazi was 'an act of terror,' Rice wrongly blamed an anti-Muslim internet video for the deadly assault in a string of high-profile interviews on network news stations.

The White House has forcefully denied that it made anything other than minor changes to Rice's talking points. Recently released e-mails between deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes and White House communications staff calls the veracity of the Obama administration's claims into question. 

The emails show that Rice was instructed to claim the attack was 'spontaneously inspired  ' and 'to ​underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure or policy.'

Geithner's anecdote about White House communications staff trying pressure him into misleading Americans about the country's ability to meet its future financial obligations once again casts a shadow on the Obama administration's willingness to tell the truth when the truth is politically unappealing.

He writes that Pfeiffer, who is now Obama's senior communications adviser, often let party politics come into play when discussing how the administration should respond to fiscal issues.

During a discussion on spending cuts, Geithner says that Pfieffer argued that 'we couldn't afford to alienate our base
 and split a weakened Democratic Party in pursuit of an imaginary 
compromise with Republicans who didn't want to compromise.'

Early reviews of Geithner's book indicate that the former Treasury Secretary, who now works at a private equity firm, does not appear to have an axe to grind with Obama, giving greater weight to his recollections.

Geithner mostly uses the memoir to provide context for actions he took as Treasury Secretary from 2009 to 2013 to get the nation back on track after the financial crisis of 2008.

The only other seemingly negative remark Geithner makes about the White House is about President Obama, whom he says, 'Sometimes I thought he wore his frustration too openly.'

'He harbored the overly optimistic belief that since his motives and values were good, since his team was thoughtful and well-intentioned, we deserved to be perceived that way,' Geithner says in the book, according to a review in the New York Times.
