Hundreds of mourners have gathered for the funeral of the schoolgirl who died after a tragic canoeing accident which claimed the lives of three children and a father.

Five-year-old Grace Mackay died after the six-man boat capsized in Loch Gairloch, Wester Ross, in the Scottish Highlands, on Sunday August 26.

The primary two pupil from Muir of Ord, near Inverness, was plucked from the water by rescuers but died the next day in hospital.

Brothers Jamie Beaton, two, and Ewen, five, also died after the canoe overturned in the sea loch in apparently calm weather.

The body of the boys’ 32-year-old father, also Ewen, from Beauly near Inverness, has yet to be found, despite extensive police and coastguard searches.

Grace’s father and her eight-year-old sister Callie survived after managing to swim to the shore.

Hundreds of people packed into East Church, Muir of Ord to pay their respects to Grace who has been described by her family as a 'beautiful angel'.

The hearse arrived at the church in Seaforth Road at around 11.45am and the coffin was taken inside as mourners began to enter the church. The car carried a floral tribute, 'Grace', written in purple and white blooms.

Several pink wreaths and bouquets were laid outside the door of the church.

One mourner arrived with a pink, heart-shaped helium balloon which was placed outside the church alongside the flowers.

Mourners sang Amazing Grace and He’s Got The Whole World In His Hands during the service, which was conducted by Rev Scott Polworth.

Afterwards, mother Wendy, father Garry and sister Callie looked on as the white coffin was placed in the hearse to the sound of a piper, who later led the cortege from the church.

The collection taken at the service 
will go to Broadford and Yorkhill hospitals where Grace was treated and 
to the coastguard service.

Grace’s
family previously described the five-year-old as a 'funny, caring, 
thoughtful' daughter and granddaughter who was full of life and loved 
animals and being outdoors.

In a statement, they said: 'She adored her family and was our beautiful angel. We are devastated by the loss of our best friend.'

Grace’s headteacher has also paid tribute to the Tarradale Primary School pupil.

Floral tributes were left for the little girl. Her family have praised the hospital staff who battled to save her

She was a 'happy, thoughtful little girl who was popular and well-liked by everybody', Tracy Sinclair said.

Earlier this week both families thanked the emergency services and local community for their help.

The
MacKay family praised staff at Broadford Hospital on the Isle of Skye 
and at Glasgow’s Yorkhill Hospital, where Grace was treated.

The Beaton family said they are focused on finding Ewen.

The funeral service for his two sons will be held on Friday in Inverness.

Local council leaders have said the deaths devastated the small communities where they lived.

The two families are thought to have been on a day trip when they went out in the canoe.

Stornoway coastguard was alerted to the capsizing at about 4.15pm on the day as Callie and Grace’s father Garry, 35, made it to the shoreline.

A helicopter and lifeboats from Portree, Gairloch and Loch Ewe launched a search and were involved in the operation to remove the three children from the water.

Eight-year-old Callie was praised for her bravery that day. Police described her as 'extremely courageous'.

Last week, police divers joined the hunt for Mr Beaton, who is presumed drowned, after days of searching found no sign of him. Northern Constabulary will continue the search for the foreseeable future.

Cash For Kids, which raises money with radio stations across the UK, said an appeal was set up after Moray Firth Radio was inundated by callers asking how they could help the families.
