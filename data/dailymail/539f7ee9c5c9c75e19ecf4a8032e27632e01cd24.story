Greek political leaders have agreed a last minute deal on austerity measures to secure a bailout and keep the country afloat, it emerged today.

Details of the agreement, which centred around €300million of pension cuts to ensure Greece met its 2012 fiscal targets, have not been released.

But the decision comes just hours before finance minister Evangelos Venizelos met with eurozone colleagues in Brussels in a last ditch attempt to stave off bankruptcy.

Broken down: Talks involving the three leaders of Greece's coalition government stalled after they failed to agree 300million euro in pension cuts, but they have now agreed a deal

Stumbling block: Greece must make further cuts to hit its fiscal targets for 2012 and be eligible for a 130billion euro second bail out

Mr Venizelos earlier today issued a dramatic plea to the coalition leaders to swiftly resolve their differences after all night talks in Athens stalled.

He warned that Greece's 'survival over the coming years' depended on the €130billion second bailout and a related debt-relief agreement with private creditors.

He said: 'It will determine whether the country remains in the eurozone or whether its place in Europe will be endangered.

'There is no room for any other expediency: we must look Greeks in the eye, look at the national interest and the interest of our children.'

Debt inspectors from the EU, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund - known as the troika - held talks for five hours through the night with Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, Mr Venizelos and Labour Minister Giorgos Koutroumanis.

But they failed to resolve the latest sticking point - a demand for substantial cuts in supplementary pensions - until a decision was reached this afternoon.

One government official said: 'Yes, there is a deal.'

Crisis talks: Greek finance minister Evangelos Venizelos has flown to Brussels to try and stave off bankruptcy

It is welcome news for the country after figures revealed a fifth of the workforce are unemployed and two labour unions announced a 48-hour strike for Friday over deeply unpopular austerity measures.

Mr Venizelos will meet with finance ministers from the 16 other eurozone nations at 17:00 GMT.

The issue that has threatened to derail the talks concerns cuts of around €300million that must be made so Greece can reach its fiscal targets for 2012.

At stake is the €130billion bailout that will stave off bankruptcy.

It was unclear whether Mr Papademos would meet with coalition backers - socialist George Papandreoum, conservative Antonis Samaras and George Karatzaferis, leader of the rightist LAOS party.

Yesterday, the three leaders held talks for more than seven hours and backed a major austerity programme that includes a 22 per cent cut in the minimum wage, the sacking of civil servants and an end to dozens of job guarantee provisions.

Athens has already accepted a demand to fire up to 15,000 workers in the public sector in 2012.

The failure to agree a deal saw markets initially fall, but the FTSE rallied to rise up 0.32 per cent this afternoon at 5,894.85, while the Dow Jones fell 0.06 per cent.

Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said the lack of progress highlighted the 'political theatre involved'.

He said: 'The political leaders in Athens are campaigning. They need to be seen by the Greek population as fighting until the very last drop of blood... they are facing off against the Germans and IMF and the rest of the world.'

A disorderly bankruptcy in Greece would likely lead to its exit from the euro - which in turn would damage other weak countries including Portugal, Ireland and Italy.

But without help, Greece will not have enough money to pay off a big bond payment due on March 20, triggering a default that risks sending shockwaves throughout financial markets.

Greece has been kept solvent since May 2010 by payments from a €110billion international rescue loan package.

When it became clear the money would not be enough, a second bailout was decided last October.

The country's unemployment rate rose to a new record of 20.9 per cent in November, up from 18.2 per cent the month before, ELSTAT figures revealed today.

Two major labour unions, GSEE anmd ADEDY, will stage a two-day strike on Friday and Saturday in protest at the austerity measures.

Ilias Iliopoulos, ADEDY's secretary general, said: 'The painful measures that create misery for youths, unemployed and pensioners do not leave us much room.

'We won't accept them. We are moving to a social uprising.'
