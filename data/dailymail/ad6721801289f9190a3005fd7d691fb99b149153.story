The father of dead teenager Michael Brown made an emotional plea for calm yesterday as he walked the tense streets of Ferguson with Thanksgiving turkeys to hand out to residents as the town braced for a grand jury announcement many fear could lead to more violence.

Traveling the same streets where his son was gunned down, many residents were surprised when he knocked on their doors, Saturday.

'I had to come and just give back to the people,' Brown told reporters. He wore a red T-shirt bearing a picture of his son's face and the messages 'Gone Too Soon' and 'I Will always Love You.'

'Everyone is suffering over this,' he added. 'I just feel that this was needed, so I came back to make sure that people have a nice Thanksgiving.'

Looking across the street, over the memorial of flowers and stuffed toys placed on the spot where his son fell in August, he held up a bird and called to a young woman: 'You get one yet?'

She smiled and waved back, yes.

St. Louis prosecutors have said they will hold a news conference to announce the outcome of the grand jury, although the date, time and location remained undetermined.

The 12-member panel met behind closed doors again on Friday.

However, CNN reported that the weekend passed with a decision, and the jury will not reconvene until Monday.

A grand jury in St. Louis meets for a standard four months, but went beyond that time frame on Sept. 10.

Their service was extended by two months along with an additional 60 days. 

Prosecutors say the full term, which ends on January 7, will no be necessary. 

Anthony Gray, an attorney for the Brown family, told reporters on Friday that the deliberations could last an hour, a day, a week, or a month. "No one can forecast when that decision will actually be reached," Gray said.

This was not Brown Sr.'s first attempt to keep the peace.  

On Friday, Brown Sr appealed for restraint in a somber video plea. 'Hurting others or destroying property is not the answer,' he said.

Cal, the dead teenager's stepmom, said they gave out more than 60 turkeys ahead of Thanksgiving next week, some bought by the family and the rest donated.

'Hopefully, we'll have big things come out of this,' she told AFP, adding the family would particularly miss Michael during the holiday season.

'Of course we'll miss him, his wittiness, his pranks. Him with his big plate of food sitting there like a king. We'll miss all of that, but despite it all, we have to try to have the normal for the other children.'

In the United States, grand juries meet in secret to review some cases before deciding whether criminal charges should be brought.

Anthony Gray, an attorney for the Brown family, told reporters on Friday that the deliberations could last an hour, a day, a week, or a month.

The jury could indict Wilson, meaning he could face trial, or it could determine there is no case for him to answer.

St Louis County prosecutors have made arrangements for a press conference to announce the decision, but no date or time has yet been confirmed.

Schools in the area announced they would close Monday and Tuesday due to potential unrest. Thanksgiving will keep them closed for the rest of next week.

Some residents doubt the jury will indict Wilson. Thomas Bradley, a 24-year-old barber, predicted that protests would be worse than in August if the officer is cleared. 

'If that's the case, I believe they will burn this city down. They'll burn it down. For sure,' he said while finishing off a young boy's buzz cut.

Shopkeepers and residents have boarded up stores and homes preparing for the decision, as Brown Sr. hopes to ease tensions

Yahoo compared the preparation to 'hurricane watch.'

'We’ve never seen anything like this,' shoe repairman Quentin Virgil, who works across from the St. Louis Police Department, said. 'The law office next door is boarded up. That’s not normal.'

The headquarters was boarded up Saturday morning while stores were flooded with residents stocking up on supplies. 

'I try not to think about it, but if they break my window, they’ll put me out of business,' said the owner of Busy Bee Alterations & Shoe Repair, Maria Mathias. 'They've really got my heart pumping right now.'

Mathias said she was terrified to see the police department being boarded up and to think of the damage her store could endure if a riot did break out.

One person tried to charge her $2,000 just to out plywood on her windows.

'I can't afford that,' she said. 

A small gaggle of protesters braved the cold late Friday to demand that Wilson stand trial for shooting Brown dead.

Brown, a high-school graduate planning on attending technical college, was shot at least six times by Wilson. His body was left in the street for hours.

Wilson reportedly told the grand jury he acted in self-defense after tussling with the youth. Others say Brown had his hands in the air when he was shot.

'I'm here for justice. If we don't get justice, ain't nobody gonna get no peace,' said 22-year-old Ebony, who works in security and refused to give a second name.

'We're going to keep protesting until we know what's right gets done,' she said. 'I want to see Darren Wilson go to jail.'

Some demonstrators in August complained that police used undue force during peaceful protests

'There's going to be violence, I do believe,' said Jo Ann Davis, a government employee who said she would not take part if rallies turn ugly.

Some demonstrators in August complained that police used undue force during peaceful protests. There was widespread criticism of military-style weapons and protective gear deployed by local officers.

'If protesters are not violent, police will not be aggressive. But if some protesters turn violent or threatening, police will respond to keep everyone safe,' St Louis Mayor Francis Slay said.
