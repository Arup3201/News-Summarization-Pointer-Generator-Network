New dad Dave Attwood starts Saturday's eagerly anticipated clash with the All Blacks ready to be more responsible off the field but more reckless on it.

Whatever happens on the pitch at Twickenham, the 27-year-old Bath lock has already had the most momentous week of his life after fiancee Bridget gave birth to the couple’s first child, Jessica, on Tuesday night, just hours after he was named in the starting line-up to face the world champions.

If baby Jessica had delayed her arrival until later this week there was every chance Attwood, who has won all but two of his 12 caps from the bench, would have missed his chance to stake a World Cup claim; four years after a nine-week stamping ban cost him a place in Martin Johnson’s squad.

‘Emotionally I’ve been fighting on two very big battlefields,’ Attwood said. ‘One, being supportive of my fiancee and the birth of our child and doing everything I can to help them out. First child is once-in-a-lifetime isn’t it? You will never get to re-do that.

‘And then obviously the game this weekend holds particular significance for me, even more so now that the most important person in the world is going to be expecting something from it.

‘My first cap was against New Zealand and I’ve come four years on, after some trials and tribulations and a bit of time off the radar, getting back involved. This game is incredibly important to me.

‘Obviously with the next 12 months shaping up as they are, then this is the time to stand up and be counted. I can’t stress how high a price I have put on this game.’

Attwood’s outstanding start to the season for Bath, after shedding almost nine kilos over the past year, has seen the former England schoolboy discus champion add mobility to his game without losing power.

Having followed instructions from England’s coaching team on tour in Argentina last year, become a dad for the first time and apparently put his disciplinary issues behind him, the 6ft 7in lock is ready to inflict some pain on his opponents on Saturday after Joe Launchbury’s withdrawal through injury.

‘Coming back from Argentina I decided I wanted to be the most powerful, destructive player I could be,’ Attwood said.

‘To be more than a substitute I had to make a significant change and one of the changes was to lose weight. I wanted anyone that came into my area, or anyone’s area that I went into, to come off second best.

‘I spent a lot of time doing heavy work in the gym, set-piece proficiency, becoming one of the best scrummaging second rows around, working the line-out, setting up mauls; real strengths of mine.

‘I wanted to get moving round the field more. And perhaps a bit more back to when I used to carry the ball with a little less consideration, perhaps to be a little bit more exciting and more reckless.

New Zealand ran out narrow 30-22 winners against England at Twickenham nearly a year ago

‘That’s been the focus this season. It has been the best start to a season ever for me.’

And on top of the weights, Attwood — who, along with prop Dave Wilson, has been given cleaning duties at England’s new Pennyhill Park training facility as part of Stuart Lancaster’s ongoing drive to instil humility in his players — hopes to find an alternative power source over the coming weeks.

‘I had an interesting conversation with (fellow new dad) Danny Care about “dad strength” and how every facet of your life gets a little extra gilt edge,’ he said. ‘Not necessarily in terms of how much you can bench press but the fact you could pull a tree out of the ground and batter someone with it. Not the standard strength tests!’
