A Salt Lake City police officer has been placed on leave after refusing an assignment to work at a gay pride parade Sunday.

Department spokeswoman Lara Jones says the officer was among about 30 officers assigned to provide traffic control and security for the annual Utah Pride Parade in Salt Lake City.

She says the department does not tolerate bias and bigotry, and it does not allow personal beliefs to enter into whether an officer will accept an assignment.

She declined comment on the officer's reason for refusing the assignment.

'We have gay men and women that serve in the police department,'Jones told The Salt Lake Tribune.

'One officer’s situation does not reflect the vast majority of officers that work in the Salt Lake City Police Department and certainly not Chief Burbank’s.'

The officer, whose name wasn't released, is on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of an internal affairs investigation.

'Officers are routinely assigned posts,'Jones said.

'To have an officer object for, perhaps anything other than fitness for duty, physical fitness etc.,  would be problematic to a smooth-functioning police department.'

Lara Jones, a spokesperson for the Salt Lake City police department said that police must put their personal beliefs aside for the good of the community

Utah Pride Center officials say they're pleased with the department's stance and think officers should undergo sensitivity training before joining the force.

'Clearly the officer’s act was more than just smelling of bigotry, but I think the act was bigotry, choosing to not do a duty that is sworn by police officers to do,' said the executive director of the Utah Pride Center Steven Ha.

Jones told reporters that bigotry is not allowed in the department and even though the unidentified officer is on paid leave he may lose his job.

'We have gay men and women that serve in the police department,' Jones told The Salt Lake Tribune.

'One officer’s situation does not reflect the vast majority of officers that work in the Salt Lake City Police Department and certainly not Chief Burbank’s.'

Police Chief Chris Burbank is supportive of the gay community and has even ridden in the pride parade.

'The vast majority of officers understand: When they put their badge on 
and come to work, they leave their personal beliefs at home, and we 
provide service to the community,' said Lara Jones.
