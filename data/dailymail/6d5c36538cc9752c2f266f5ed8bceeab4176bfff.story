A climber and his faithful dog died after suffering hundreds of stings in an attack by killer bees.

Mountaineer Steven Johnson's cause of death was confirmed on Thursday as 'mass envenomation'.

The 55-year-old, a counselor with some 30 years experience hiking and climbing was found dead, hanging 70-feet from the ground in his climbing gear in the Santa Rita Mountains on Monday night, according to the sheriff's office.

The Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office says 55-year-old Steven Johnson (pictured) was found in the Santa Rita Mountains south of Tucson late Monday

His dead dog was discovered at the top of
the cliff. Johnson was last seen on Friday when he went hiking, and friends became worried when he didn't go to work on Monday.

A group of climbers and friends of Mr Johnson set out in a search party to look for him. After they came across his body, they worked late into the night to bring him down. One climber described the scene as 'tragic and horrifying'.

His small dog was found at the top of the cliff covered in bee stings. Mr Johnson's friend buried his loyal pet on the mountain.

Friend and fellow climber Jason Mullins told Azstarnet.com: 'Steve was a well-liked, long-standing, integral part of the Tucson climbing community. We're all saddened by the news. He'll be greatly missed.'

Sheriff's Lt. Raoul Rodriguez says Johnson may have disturbed bees by hammering a spike into the cliff.

said the 55-year-old man was found hanging from his climbing gear on a 
cliff near Mount Hopkins

'He had anchored himself to the wall as
he was going down so he was actually anchored and he must have been 
attacked and was not able to climb back up or go back down,' said Rodriguez.

Johnson is described as a father, climber and friend, who was well-liked throughout the climbing community in Southern Arizona.

Deputies of the Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Department and its search and rescue unit found Johnson’s body Monday at 6.30pm.

Killer bees have become a problem in the south west of the country, especially in cities like Phoenix and Tuscson which have programs to destroy them for public safety.

However, despite their fearsome reputation, Dr May Berenbaum, a professor and department head at the University of Illinois' Department of Entomology and one of the country's leading bee experts said that public information is the key to limiting fatalities.

'When bees sting, it's always in defense. They're not cruising the neighborhood to make trouble,' said Berenbaum.

'They're not kamikaze, intent on their own destruction. They sting if they perceive a threat on their own home.'

However, Berenbaum's description of an African bee attack to ABC News makes for disturbing reading.

Once stung, the bee releases a pheromone that attracts other bees to attack - which is why most African bee attacks are in swarms.
