These two young men are the only living cases in the world with an extremely rare disorder and they  happen to be related to each other.

Teenage brothers Thomas and Bradley Farrell both suffer from Arts Syndrome - a genetic condition that has effected their hearing, sight and muscle tone basically since birth.

The boys, aged 17 and 18 respectively, have spent their lives in and out of Sydney hospitals with various complications related to their condition, which went undiagnosed until 2001.

Teenage brothers Thomas and Bradley Farrell both suffer from Arts Syndrome - a genetic condition that has effected their hearing, sight and muscle tone basically since birth

When Bradley was diagnosed as being deaf at 12 months of age, his mother Sharon was already pregnant with Thomas and the family were told there was a one in four chance of having another deaf child.

Thomas was diagnosed at five months.

But despite having two boys who were deaf, Ms Farrell told Daily Mail Australia there was no reason for the family to be concerned at that point.

'Bradley and Thomas looked like normal young boys,' she said. 

It wasn't until after they both got cochlear implants in 1999 that they realised something might be wrong.

Bradley and Thomas have battled serious infections over the years in relation to their syndrome. They still use a breathing machine today to help them get by

'After they got the implants they had to go to hospital. Both Bradley and Thomas had influenza. When they took the tubes from Bradley, they didn't think he would pull through.

'Then every six months they were in hospital with respiratory problems.'

It took nine years from when they first started testing their DNA and blood for the team at Westmead Children's Hospital to diagnose the boys with Arts Syndrome.

The specific gene related to their condition was only found in 2007.

They still use a breathing machine today to help them get by and they are highly susceptible to infection. 

The brothers have very limited vision and have been confined to wheelchairs for the past several years due to muscle weakness.

'There’s no cure and that’s just the way it is,' Ms Farrell said.

Their mother Sharon was told Bradley was deaf when he was 12 months old and Thomas was diagnosed at five months of age - but she had no reason to worry at that stage

'Lots of young people who have rare disorders are still waiting to find out what they have. There’s millions of genes. It’s like a needle in a haystack. We were very lucky to find out what it was.

'If we can keep them healthy and happy, that’s my main objective. We just want to give them a good quality of life.'

The life expectancy for Arts Syndrome, which primarily effects boys, is five years of age.

'They had already surpassed the life expectancy when we were told (about the gene),' Ms Farrell said.

'Every time we make a visit to the hospital… the doctors don’t know and we certainly don’t know what to expect. 

'We go in with one complaint and there’s something else that’s happening at the same time. We go in hoping it’s only a short stay but sometimes it can be longer.' 

While there is no treatment for the genetic condition, the boys have been taken a drug treatment called SAM for the past six years to help with complications associated with the syndrome.

'They haven’t been in intensive care as respiratory patients for a number of years, which is wonderful,' Ms Farrell said.

Problems associated with the syndrome started from birth, but Ms Farrell said it was hard to pick up because Bradley and Thomas looked like normal young boys

Their mother is primary carer for Bradley and Thomas, with help from their 21-year-old sister Nancy.

'They can’t dress themselves or feed themselves, but they have electric wheelchairs that's given them good independence around the house,' she said.

'When they were smaller we could lift them out of the bathtub, but we've had to make modifications. The boys were getting longer and heavier, so putting them in a shower chair makes life a lot easier.'

Former Australian cricketer Steve Waugh made a big impact on the Farrell family when his rare disease foundation first stepped in to provide ongoing support six years ago. 

The Steve Waugh Foundation, which helps raise awareness of rare diseases, provided the funds to modify the Farrell's bathroom to suit Bradley and Thomas' needs.

'Every time we seem to need help, there always seems to be support somewhere. You don’t know where it comes from. Sometimes it’s the most unlikely places like the Steve Waugh Foundation,' Ms Farrell said.

'We could be members of a hundred different organisations but they only concentrate on certain things. The Steve Waugh Foundation looks at (rare diseases) as a whole unit and how they can help the individual to make their life better.'

Bradley and Thomas are set to meet Steve on Wednesday at an event he organised at Sydney's Taronga Zoo for 32 people with rare diseases and their families.

Rare Disease Day on Saturday marks 10 years since the Steve Waugh Foundation started raising awareness of the two million Australians who suffer from a rare disease.

'Bradley and Thomas never fail to inspire me with their incredible inner strength and spirit of goodwill,' Steve said.

'They light up the room with their cheeky smiles and sense of humour and have a gift for relaxing anyone who is in their company. Without realising it, they are both role models for all of us with their amazingly positive attitude.'

The Foundation is calling on Australians to share this video and use the hashtag: #AllWeAsk on Rare Disease Day, February 28.
