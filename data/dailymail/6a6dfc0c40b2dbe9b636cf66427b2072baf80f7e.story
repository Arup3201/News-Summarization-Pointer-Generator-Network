Rock and real royalty combined in Paris this weekend at the Gucci Masters, with Bruce Springsteen's daughter Jessica and Princess Caroline of Monaco's daughter Charlotte Casiraghi competing in the Gucci Masters.

Both Jessica and Caroline are accomplished horse riders and they were given the chance to show off their equestrian skills in front of thousands at the four-day show jumping event in the French capital.

The women also got a chance to show off their sense of fashion in the event's Charity Pro-AM Style & Competition round, which sees a professional pair up with an amateur.

Bruce Springsteen's daughter Jessica also took part in the equestrian event 

The teams run a relay around the course but also get to choose their outfit theme and the background music that will be playing. 

Jessica, who has represented the United States in the Show Jumping World Cup and the 2012 FEI Nations Cup went for a Western theme for her costume, while Caroline picked out an urban style, even choosing a graffiti pattern for her horse. 

Charlotte partnered with Olympic-level equestrian rider Edwina Tops-Alexander, while Jessica competed with the French actor Guillaume Canet. 

The competition also had a personal angle for Charlotte - her mother Caroline is a patron of the children's charity AMADE, which is a benefactor of the event.

Charlotte has had a busy year both personally and professionally - last December she and her French comedy actor boyfriend  Gad Elmaleh, welcomed their son Raphael into the world. 

French actor Guillaume Canet also competed in the Charity Pro-AM Style & Competition round of the event alongside Charlotte and Jessica. The teams run a relay around the course but also get to choose their outfit theme and the background music that will be playing

Charlotte's washboard stomach made it almost impossible to tell that the royal had given birth only 12 months ago. 

The 28-year-old has a long history with the Gucci - she is the the official equestrian "ambassador" for the fashion house and the company designs an exclusive range for the Caroline to wear during her showjumping competitions. 

In September, she also starred in an ad campaign for the fashion house's latest make-up range.

Despite Charlotte's heavily made-up face at the competition this week, the star recently told Glamour magazine that she favours natural beauty and her best beauty tip is fresh air. 

She said: 'To have a natural, healthy glow, you need to spend as much time as you can outside—if you stay locked up in an office, it can take a toll on your mind and body. 

'Personally, fresh air and exercise help me stay healthy and make me feel great.'
