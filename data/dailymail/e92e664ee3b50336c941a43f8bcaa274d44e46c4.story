Comedian Jim Davidson has slammed the ‘silly’ celebrity witch hunt over the Jimmy Savile scandal.

The 58-year-old entertainer, from Kidbrooke, south-east London, suggested that rumours over the identity of people who may have sexually abused children could lead to stars being falsely accused.

Davidson admitted knowing about problems with Savile before the recent allegations came out, saying the late presenter was ‘just another pervert’ and ‘there are lots of them in showbiz’.

He wrote on his blog, under the title 'Enough is enough': 'The Jimmy Savile witch hunt is going a bit silly now. We all are starting to speculate and accuse - even in jest. So no, I don’t know who’s next.

‘Well, if I was in the pub with the lads it would be a different story. Everyone has had the nod.

‘Everyone is now an expert. Just pick someone you don’t like and say it’s them. So I’ll be the first one to knock it on the head and belt up. How’s about that then?’

It came days after Davidson claimed that he knew who would be the next person to be exposed over the scandal, and then wrote that everyone is trying to 'have a guess', reported the Sunday Mirror.

The entertainer, who starts a UK tour in Bedford in three weeks’ time, added that the BBC has ‘finally gone mental’ over the Savile affair after making ‘a programme blaming the BBC’.

He said: ‘This hot bed of “leftyness” has asked itself the question: "Should we have known?" The answer is "yes". We all knew didn't we?

‘A bloke who's a loner dresses and acts like a nonce and thinks he is the most important person in the world. Hmmm. I knew... and didn't do anything.

'Mind you I had no proof. To me he was just another pervert.’

Jim Davidson on Jimmy Savile

The five-times married star, who has previously battled an addiction to alcohol, is well known for programmes such as The Generation Game, The Jim Davidson Show and Big Break.

After starting in Bedfordshire, Davidson's latest tour will also visit Hayes, west London; Stroud, Gloucestershire; and Portcawl, South Wales.

His comments come after Max Clifford claimed dozen of big name stars from the 1960s and 70s have called him 'frightened to death' they will become implicated in the widening Savile scandal.

The PR guru said the stars were worried because at their peak they lived a hedonistic lifestyle where young girls threw themselves at them and they 'never asked for anybody's birth certificate'.

Earlier today officers investigating the Savile scandal arrested former pop star Gary Glitter. He was held at 7.15am at an address in central London and taken to a police station in the capital.

ENOUGH IS ENOUGH

'Front page eh?……Well I was only stating the obvious (Jim’s Newspaper). It just goes to show how much interest this Saville thing is having. I read a thing today(in The Express) some one saw Jimmy Saville pinch some girl’s bum . Apparently that is a sexual assault. Where will all this end. As odd as he was, Saville can’t defend himself.The bloke’s dead for Godsake.

'Let’s move on and get some important stories in the paper. I haven’t heard anything about Jordan lately. What’s happened?

'Fund raising for the British Forces foundation tonight. Monday sees me, Bobby Davro,Claire Sweeny and Mike Osman off to entertain the Navy on HMS Dauntless.

'Spare a thought today for the two British troops KIA. There’s news.

'Oh and do I really know who the next exposed pervert is?….well, have a guess,because that’s what the press are doing,that’s what we’re all doing!'PANORAMA

'How come the BBC can make a program blaming the BBC?

'It's like having yourself arrested and then being your own prosecuting barrister!

'The BBC has finaly gone mental. This hot bed of leftyness has asked itself the question: "Should we have known?" The answer is yes. We all knew didn't we?

'A bloke who's a loner dresses and acts like a nonce and thinks he is the most important person in the world. Hmmm. I knew... and didn't do anything. Mind you I had no proof. To me he was just another pervert.

'There are lots of them in Showbiz. There seems to be more gay ones than straight, but that's because there are probably more gays in showbiz than most professions.

'Who's next to be the victim of a media feeding frenzy? I have the answer to that but like Jimmy Savile it's only rumours... but when these rumours come out... WOW!'
