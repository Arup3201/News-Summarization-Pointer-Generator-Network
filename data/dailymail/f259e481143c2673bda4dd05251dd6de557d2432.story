I saw a pillow in John Lewis the other day that cost £85 and I thought: ‘How can that aid slumber any better than a pillow costing tens of pounds less?’

I don’t know how much the pillows at the Viceroy New York cost – but I would be prepared to pay at least three figures for just one of them.

They are extraordinary.

Viceroy Double: Guests are cocooned in luxurious wood and treated to astonishingly comfortable beds

I’d had a scout around the hotel’s website before arriving, and didn't notice any pillow previews.

They deserve their own microsite.

As I lie down, the prospect of wakefulness disappears in a flash. My head sinks right into the pillow, yet it feels supported.

In fact, the whole Viceroy bed is heavenly. Climbing into one is like falling into the arms of an angel.

In the morning, the weariness brought on by transatlantic travel is banished. So I decide to inspect the rest of the ‘deluxe’ twin room that I’m sharing with my travelling companion - my mum.

The beds are in a cocoon of rich wooden furnishings, from the bedside wardrobes to the writing table.

It doesn't feel like a hotel room, more like someone’s trendy Manhattan apartment.

The bathroom is a work of art, with an impossibly grand round mirror above the sink. It is complemented by a satellite shaving mirror that you can swing from side to side on a metal arm.

It looks very expensive.

A walk-in rain shower completes the set-up.

The Viceroy New York, which opened last October, has other aces up its sleeve – one being the location. For one, it is on West 57th Street, which puts you within walking distance of a whole feast of Big Apple musts.

Tasty: The Kingside restaurant's frittata with crumpets, plus a smooth cup of coffee

Central Park? Two minutes’ walk away. Rockefeller Center? Seven minutes south, by foot. Museum of Modern Art? You’ll measure the time it takes to get there in seconds.

Carnegie Hall, meanwhile, is practically next door.

Before you head out though, do not skip the Viceroy breakfast.

It is served in the hotel’s bistro-esque Kingside restaurant - where the decor resembles that of the bedrooms, with the same tones, luxurious woods and sumptuous leather.

The coffee is smooth and strong, the orange juice long and fresh, the frittata with maple bacon spot-on – and the service nothing short of exemplary.

Superb dining at the Kingside restaurant 

Beautifully choreographed styling 

The dinner experience is similarly enticing. I’m always encouraged by menus that don’t have too many dishes on them – it’s usually a sign that quality is the priority.

And that’s the case at Kingside.

It is a fusion of Italian, French and American cooking, with offerings such as roasted wild king salmon with asparagus and green onion, braised pork shank with roasted shallots, certified angus 32oz cowboy rib eye and lamb chops with chickpeas and yoghurt.

Me? I go for the Kingside Burger with white cheddar and giardiniera relish.

It is tender and perfectly cooked, but does look a bit lonely on the big white plate. I’m surprised the hotel hasn't caught on to the hipster method of burger presentation, using a wooden chopping board, given the hotel’s love of quality wood.

Mother Thornhill opts for a shaved kale salad with goat cheese and toasted almonds, which also gets the thumbs-up. I wash down the burger with a New Zealand sauvignon blanc, which is suitably fruity.

The quality of the restaurant is underscored by the fact that people not staying at the hotel travel here to dine.

The rooftop bar is also a destination watering hole – a magnet for trendy young professionals.

Watering hole: The Viceroy rooftop bar offers drinkers an urbane environment in which to quench their thirst

But it’s the view that is the biggest draw. It almost makes me gasp.

The rooftop looks out over Central Park and the whole of upper Manhattan. At 29 floors, the Viceroy is by no means the tallest building in the area, but it doesn’t need to be - because it’s higher than enough of the surrounding structures to facilitate prime cityscape gazing.

The bar takes mixology seriously. House cocktails include the Espresso Martini, Mojito and Without Fear, made using Jameson Black Barrel whiskey with apricot liquer.

We stay on a Monday and Tuesday, and the atmosphere is lively on both nights.

There is also a bar at the front of the Kingside restaurant, at street level, which is similarly beguiling.

There are a few extra snazzy garnishes at the Viceroy that raise its cool factor.

I like the fact that you sign in by finger-writing your signature on an iPad at the reception desk – and that every bedroom comes with a Beats by Dr Dre beatbox - and a smartphone pre-loaded with information about the hotel, from room service to the cocktail menu. Very hip.

Wi-fi, meanwhile, is free and very fast.

Are there any downsides? Yes, but we’re quibbling here. Viceroy New York doesn't have a lot of girth, and some may find the standard rooms a tad compromised space-wise.

But for a few nights, they are perfect.

Roomy: The Viceroy's suites have ample square-footage

There are 240 rooms in total, including some pricier suites - 43 of them - with more space for spreading out.

Also, for the room price, you might expect the hotel to offer a swimming pool. 

This is a hotel that inflates your ego – you’ll want to boast to people that you are staying there. It has poise, finesse and beautifully choreographed suave styling that may make you feel as if you are living in an aftershave advert.

Or a bed advert.
