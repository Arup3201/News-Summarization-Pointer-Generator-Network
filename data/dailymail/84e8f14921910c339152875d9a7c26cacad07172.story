Britain has plunged down a league table measuring international standards of living.

In a sign of the hard times facing families, the Office for National  Statistics said the UK has dropped from fifth in 2005 to 12th in 2011.

The league table of the world’s wealthiest nations, using the latest available official figures, is based on how much money households have after paying their taxes and what they can afford to buy with their spare cash.

Fall: Britain has fallen down the household league table from fifth in 2005 to 12th in the new 2011 table

While Britain used to be beaten only  by America, Luxembourg, Norway and Germany, it is now trumped by a much longer list of countries including Switzerland, Australia, France, Belgium, Sweden and Canada.

While average incomes have risen in Britain, they have increased by more  in rival nations. At the same time, the price of goods has risen by a higher  margin in Britain – meaning we can buy less with our salaries compared with  people in other countries.

The ONS’s research is based on what it calls each person’s ‘actual household  disposable income’. This is defined as their total income – not only their salary but also other items such as interest on their savings – minus their tax bill.

It also includes the value of any free ‘benefits’ received from the Government, such as NHS treatment and education. But the total figure is then adjusted to take account of the prices of goods and services in each country.

Plunging economic fortunes: David Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne were today hit by the news that Britain has slipped down the global family income league table, caused by the economic crisis

In Britain, the average disposable 
income for 2011 is given as £18,291, which has risen slightly from 2005,
when it was £17,069.

But in other countries it has risen much faster, pushing the UK  down the league table as it has been rapidly overtaken.

Based on research by the Organisation 
for Economic Co-operation and Development, which measures economic and 
social well-being around the world, the ONS report said the UK’s 
downfall was primarily fuelled by the collapse in the ‘purchasing power’
of households.

The ONS said: ‘Between 2005 and 2011, the price of goods and services in the UK has increased relative to other countries.

‘As a result, although household 
income in the UK has grown, when compared to other countries that income
doesn’t stretch so far. This goes some way in explaining why the UK 
ranks relatively lower than it did in 2005.’

It comes as a separate report, from 
the Halifax bank, warned that millions of families are ‘at full stretch 
financially’ and are being hit by a ‘squeeze’ forcing many to ‘cut back 
where they can’.

Around one in two ‘admitted they would find it difficult to cope if their monthly outgoings increased by up to £99’.

Others are even more hard-pressed, 
with their finances so finely balanced they would be tipped over the 
edge with just a £24 increase in monthly bills.

Anthony Warrington, director of 
personal current accounts at Halifax, said: ‘Rising prices are putting 
disposable income under increasing pressure.

Jobless: This table shows unemployment rates in the OECD states in 2011. The UK went from 12th place in 2005 to 21st in 2011

Comparison: This table shows GDP per head in all the major economies. The UK is ranked 14th in the table of 30 states

‘With essentials such as mortgages and
rental payments, food and energy bills taking up the  largest chunk of 
household spending, it leaves some households with little room for 
manoeuvre.’

Frances O’Grady, general secretary of 
the Trades Union Congress, said: ‘The combination of recession and 
austerity has taken its toll on household finances, with income levels 
in the UK falling behind many of its European neighbours.

‘Even before the recession, household spending in the UK was far more reliant on debt than in other advanced economies.

‘In order to address this as a country
we need to obsess less about housing bubbles and focus instead on 
securing decent pay rises and creating better-paid jobs.’
