Celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal has dismissed 'Chinese Restaurant Syndrome' as being nothing more than an 'old wives' tale'.

At the Cheltenham Literature Festival, the three Michelin-starred chef told an audience that the controversial additive is perfectly safe.

Chinese Restaurant Syndrome describes a group of symptoms that some people experience after eating food from a Chinese restaurant, such as sweating and chest pains. 

Heston Blumenthal, owner of the Fat Duck restaurant in Bray, said the suggestion that food additive monosodium glutamate (MSG) is bad for you is 'complete and utter nonsense' 

A food additive called monosodium glutamate (MSG) is often blamed for Chinese restaurant syndrome, but the acclaimed chef dismissed that suggestion.

He said: 'The biggest old wives tail is that MSG is bad for you. That is complete and utter nonsense.

'There is not one (scientific) paper to prove that. These beliefs come from the 1970s when some journalist wrote about it.

'With salt there is a 50/50 argument but there is no argument with MSG,' adding that glutamate is actually 'a really important element of taste.'

Chinese restaurant syndrome describes a group of symptoms that some people experience after eating food from a Chinese restaurant. 

A food additive called monosodium glutamate (MSG) is often blamed for Chinese restaurant syndrome, but scientific evidence has not proven MSG to be the cause of the symptoms.

MSG is a food additive that is used as a flavour enhancer to make foods taste better. 

MSG is similar to glutamate, a substance that is found naturally in almost all foods

Symptoms of Chinese restaurant syndrome usually begin within two hours after eating foods that contain MSG. 

They can last anywhere from a few hours to a couple of days. 

Common symptoms include headaches, sweating, skin flushing, numbness, burning in the mouth and fatigue.

The celebrity chef went on to discuss his latest book, Historic Heston.

He regaled tales from his research into our culinary heritage, talking about a recipe he discovered in the Georgian period in which they used to roast a chicken and then reportedly 'bring it back to life'.

It was plucked while it was alive, basted and then rocked to sleep before causing chaos at the dining table. 

Another tale of the period involved a midget being placed in a pie – but unlike the chicken he survived.

Heston also told his audience that 'this was probably the greatest period in British cooking ever.'

'The last great period in Britain for gastronomy was the Georgian period in the mid 1700s,' he said, 'they were fairly advanced in some of the food they made.

'What happened after that, and the reason our culinary heritage took a nose dive, was land reclamation when all the free land you could graze and grow food on was taken away,.

'People were forced to live in cities. The Industrial Revolution arrived and then we embraced everything French. Mrs Beeton and all that were very French cooking. '

As for the future, the chef predicted that flavour perception is 'going to be a big thing' in the next five to 10 years.

'I can feel it in my waters,' he said. 'We are only scratching the surface.'
