'In pursuit of his dream': Lance Corporal Craig Roberts who died during a gruelling SAS endurance test in the Brecon Beacons

An Army reservist who died alongside a colleague during an SAS selection exercise in 30C heat was 'in pursuit of his dream', his family said today.

Lance Corporal Craig Roberts, 24, and another serviceman were both pronounced dead after collapsing during the gruelling 17-mile march in the Brecon Beacons on Saturday.

A third soldier taking part was also rushed to hospital needing treatment on the hottest day of the year so far.

In a statement issued through the Ministry of Defence today, Mr Roberts’ father Kelvin said: 'We are all devastated at the loss of our beloved Craig; this has left a massive hole in all our lives.'

Mr Roberts said his son, who was due to start a new job in the Education Secretary’s office, died pursuing his dream.

'We wholeheartedly supported Craig in his military endeavours and it gives us some comfort, though great sadness, that he died in the pursuit of his dream,' he said.

'Next month Craig was due to start a new post in the office of the Secretary of State for Education and we were all very proud of him.'

Hiker David Capstick last night described how he passed a ‘distressed’ infantrymen being helped by a colleague in the mountains.

According to sources, the three men were at the start of an assessment period in the selection process for the TA's section of the SAS, after completing a period of training and preparation.

Despite the tragedy, the Army was 
yesterday pressing ahead with military exercises in the remote and 
rugged area, which is used to put both regular and special forces 
through their paces.

Mr Capstick told Channel 4 that he and a group of 
other walkers had seen two troops making slow progress as they passed in
the opposite direction.

‘One of the soldiers made a 
compassionate plea for some drinking water for his colleague,’ he said. 
‘I don’t think it occurred to us that fatalities were going to result.

‘But it certainly was slightly odd 
that the two soldiers in particular had bunched together and were 
clearly in distress. That caused a little bit of alarm among us.

‘But it was a military exercise and you do expect, I suppose, that they are under duress and discomfort.’

Mr Capstick said one soldier was ‘upset’ and asked for water for his colleague rather than himself.

Tributes have poured in for Mr 
Roberts, from Penrhyn Bay, near Llandudno, who is believed to have been a
maths teacher at Trinity School in Lewisham, south-east London and 
reportedly served with the TA for more than five years, including tours 
of Iraq and Afghanistan.

Several tribute pages have already been set up on social networking site Facebook, with tributes from both friends and pupils.

One page described him as a 'true gentleman, caring, genuine guy'.

Josh Jones wrote: 'OMG can not believe this. It's a shock a awesome guy a great school friend and such a big personality.'

Another
page included tributes from people who appeared to be the teacher's 
students at Trinity, many praising him for how much he had helped them.

Tobi Arthurton wrote: 'R.I.P Mr Roberts, your a 1 in a million teacher, person.

'Was an understanding person. Its so upsetting your future was bright. R.I.P Mr Roberts.

'You will be missed and remembered.'

Joshua Jackson added: 'RIP Mr Roberts you have helped so many people especially the year 11!'

Others described how the school would 'not be the same' without Mr Roberts.

A Department for Education (DfE) spokesman said: 'Craig Roberts was due to start work at the Department for Education on August 12 having won a place on a prestigious training scheme for high-flying graduates. Our thoughts are with his family.'

The Brecon Beacons is one of several locations the British military use as part of their training.

A keen sportsman, Lance Corporal Roberts
graduated from Leicester University with a degree in banking and was a 
former financial consultant. 

Its
rugged and sprawling terrain helps prepare soldiers physically and 
mentally for warfare as well as put their logistic skills to the test, 
making it an ideal area for elite forces personnel like the SAS, but it 
can prove dangerous.

Earlier
this year, Army captain Rob Carnegie was found dead on snow-covered 
Corn Du mountain. It was thought he had been taking part in a gruelling 
17-40 mile march in freezing conditions as part of a selection process 
for the special forces regiment when he collapsed and died.

According
to the MoD website, the SAS (Reserve) selection course is run twice a 
year and consists of two main components - 'aptitude' and 
'continuation'.

He had taken part in exercises several times including a training mission in Texas with the American National Guard - which incorporated hot weather training in the desert aimed at replicating conditions in the Middle East.

The 
'progressively arduous' aptitude phase is designed to select volunteers 
with the right qualities, including physical and mental robustness; self-confidence; self-discipline; the ability to work alone; and the 
ability to assimilate information and new skills.

According
to the website, the continuation training - after passing aptitude - is
an intensive period of instruction and assessment on Special Forces 
tactics, techniques and procedures, including weapons and standard 
operating procedures.

Military chiefs have ordered an 
inquiry into the exercise and how the victims were monitored on one of 
the Army’s most unforgiving training areas, in which troops were 
carrying kit including a 50lb backpack, SA80 assault rifle and 
ammunition.

However, bosses say the routine 
exercises will continue as normal. ‘We have taken measures to try to 
make sure this does not happen again,’ said a source.

Dyfed-Powys Police are also probing the deaths on the rugged landscape close to the 2,900ft peak of Pen y Fan.

Sources indicated the tragedy was caused by heat exhaustion. A third soldier remains in hospital
