Former Manchester United manager David Moyes has revealed how he almost joined rivals Arsenal during his playing career.

Moyes, who is currently in charge of La Liga side Real Sociedad, started his playing career as a centre-back for Celtic before spending time at Cambridge, Dunfermline and Preston North End among others.

But, the 51-year-old has admitted he once came close to joining Arsenal when he was playing for Celtic.

Moyes told fourfourtwo.com: 'When I tell people they start laughing. Cambridge then were in what's now the Championship.

'Arsenal manager Terry Neill called me at my house in Glasgow and told me they were going to sign me, but a week later, they called back and said 'we've decided to take you on loan.'

'I wasn't having that, leaving Celtic to go on loan, so I turned it down. Arsenal went on to buy the late Tommy Caton instead. I joined Cambridge and played every week, which I wasn't doing at Celtic.'

Much like his time at Old Trafford, Moyes' time at Cambridge was largely unsuccessful, with the U's finishing bottom of division two in 1984.

Dreams of an immediate promotion died quickly too as Cambridge finished bottom of division three a year later, leaving Moyes to think 'what if' had he gone to Arsenal.

Moyes said: 'We were relegated two years in a row at Cambridge before I moved to Bristol City. That league had Newcastle United in it, with Kevin Keegan and Chris Waddle, and Chelsea, with Kerry Dixon and David Speedie.

'It was a really tough league and Cambridge were the smallest club in the division - as they would be now.

'We went down and there was a chain reaction which couldn't be stopped and we went down again.

'I played nearly 600 games in my career and it was varied through the divisions. That helps me as a coach and I wouldn't change it, though maybe I should have said yes to Arsenal.'
