Former Labour spin doctor Damian McBride will reveal the secrets of the inner workings of the Brown operation

Damian McBride, the Labour spin doctor who resigned over a smear scandal, is to publish his memoirs – presenting Ed Miliband with a fresh headache.

The book, which promises the truth about plots that tore the party apart during the Blair-Brown years, will coincide with the Labour conference in September.

Mr McBride is the first member of Gordon Brown’s inner circle, which also included Mr Miliband, to publish details of how they seized control of the party.

The book is expected to reveal Mr Miliband’s behaviour in the dying days of the last government and will be scrutinised for material critical of the Labour leader.

The timing of the announcement is a second blow to Mr Miliband after his brother David quit British politics admitting he could not work for him.

Mr McBride – known as ‘Mad Dog’ by his allies and ‘McPoison’ by his enemies – resigned in April 2009 after emails he wrote smearing senior Tories.

His book, Power Trip: A Decade of Policy, Plots and Spin, will lift the lid on Mr Brown’s government and his rows with Chancellor Alistair Darling during the financial crisis.

Mr Darling famously accused Mr Brown and Mr Balls of unleashing the ‘forces of hell’ in a briefing  against him.

In a statement yesterday, publishers Biteback said: ‘It is a book which will send shivers down the back of the Labour establishment as it reveals the truth about life within Gordon Brown’s government.

Mr McBride was at Gordon Brown's side for a decade, before being forced to quit in 2009 over plans to smear Tory MPs with false rumours

‘[Mr McBride] writes candidly about his experiences at the heart of government, and provides the first genuine insider’s account of Gordon Brown’s time as Chancellor and Prime Minister.

‘He reveals the personal feuds, political plots, and media manipulation which lay at New Labour’s core, and provides a fascinating, funny, and at times shocking account of how government really works.’

A Labour source said: ‘Under Ed Miliband’s leadership, the party has moved a long way from those days. We have turned a page.’

The decision to break cover four years after he quit will fuel talk in Westminster that Mr McBride is seeking to clear the air and make a return to frontline politics.

He took aim at David Miliband earlier this week, claiming ‘timidity’ had held back the former foreign secretary.

Mr MCBride has used a blog to reveal the inner workings of the Brown administration, which have become a must-read for journalists and MPs.

The memoir, due to be published during the autumn Labour conference, will lay bare the extraordinary feud between Gordon Brown and Tony Blair in the battle over who should be Prime Minister

Just yesterday Mr McBride took a 
swipe at David Miliband, who announced he was quitting British politics 
two and a half years after losing the Labour leadership contest.

Mr
McBride said Mr Miliband failure of nerve had stopped him from moving 
against Mr Brown before the last general election: 'His huge moment was 
2008 but we monstered him because of his timidity.'

The memoir is likely to make for 
uncomfortable reading for Mr Miliband, who worked alongside Mr Brown and
Mr McBride in the Treasury before becoming an MP but has sought to play
down his links with the former PM.

Ed
Balls, Labour’s shadow chancellor, was also a close ally of Mr McBride 
but sought to distance himself after the communications chief was forced
to quit in 2009.

Mr 
McBride gave a flavour of life working for Mr Brown last year in a blog 
post on the former PM's infamous temper. He wrote: 'There are two 
phrases that every former Gordon Brown staffer got used to hearing when 
he couldn’t hide his exasperation with them any longer.

The memoir is expected to make for uncomfortable reading for Labour leader Ed Miliband and shadow chancellor Ed Balls, who were both close aides to Mr Brown before becoming MPs

'The
first – delivered slowly and usually punctuated with a pounding fist on
the back of a chair – was “Too. Many. Mistakes.” The second – delivered
in a strangled growl, usually at the person he wanted to murder on the 
spot – was: “I NEED NEW PEOPLE”.'

Iain
Dale, the former Tory blogger who is now managing director of 
publishers Biteback, said: ‘I have absolute confidence in predicting 
Damian’s book will be seen as the political memoir of the year.

‘I’ve been chasing this book for at least eighteen months and am delighted to have persuaded Damian to put pen to paper.

‘Everyone
knows from his blog that Damian is a brilliantly incisive writer and 
that he was in a unique position to expose what being at the centre of 
power in the Brown government was really like.’

After being cast out of the Labour 
fold, Mr McBride has used his blog to give a brutally honest account of 
the Brown regime’s failings.

Mr
McBride said: ‘Given that Iain Dale was one of my supposed enemies when
I was working in Downing Street, he was the last person I expected to 
be working with, but his thoughts on what this book should be about 
exactly matched my own, and I am delighted to be publishing it with him.

‘I
hope that, like my blog, this book will be a chance not only to give my
account of what happened during Gordon Brown's time in office, but also
to give an insight into what life is like for those working in 
government today.’

Royalties
will be split between the Catholic aid agency Cafod, where Mr McBride 
now works, and the appeal by his former employers Finchley Catholic High
School to build a new sixth-form centre.
