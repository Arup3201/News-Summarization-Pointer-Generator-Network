An animation has been released revealing how the Twittersphere lit up during last night's World Cup semi-final between Brazil and Germany.

The 'heat map' tracked real-time tweets as users across the world mentioned key terms surrounding the game over two hours with users sending a record 35.6m tweets.

After Germany's second goal the numbers of tweets grew steadily and instead of showing peaks and troughs as the data has in previous World Cup matches, it showed a sustained use of the social network as the tension in the match dramatically increased. 

The match became Twitter's most discussed sports game ever - it easily beat the previous record of 24.9m tweets 
set by the Super Bowl earlier in 2014.

The 
game also broke the record for the most tweets per minute - when 
Germany's Sami Khedira's scored the team's fifth goal in the 29th minute Twitter saw 
580,166 tweets per minute.

Previously the Brazil versus Chile match generated the highest single-minute activity with 388,985 tweets per minute.

Germany's
 Miroslav Klose was the most mentioned player during the game, after 
becoming the all-time record goal scorer in World Cup finals.

Lewis Wiltshire, Director of Media Partnerships for Twitter, told MailOnline:  'The more unexpected and more exciting games have brought higher traffic - the games involving the host nation have all generated high peaks.

'Last night there were three individual moments which generated more tweets per minute than other games.

Once when Toni Kroos scored, again when he scored and the highest was when Sami Khedira scored.

'When major events happen in the real world people respond to them on Twitter.'

Twitter's usage of users sending 140-character bursts during global events has been growing at a rapid rate over recent years.

In
 2012, Usain Bolt's gold-medal 200m sprint peaked at 80,000 tweets per 
minute, while Miley Cyrus' infamous MTV VMAs performance peaked at 
360,000 tweets per minute.
