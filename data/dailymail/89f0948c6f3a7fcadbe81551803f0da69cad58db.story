She was the formidable style maven editor who advised Jackie O, discovered Twiggy and called herself  'the one and only fashion editor.'

Diana Vreeland, who died in 1989, edited the glossy magazine Harpers Bazaar for 26 years from 1936 before going on to U.S. Vogue for 10 years between 1963 and 1971.

Unsurprisingly, with friends at the world's finest design houses, her collection of clothing was extensive and impressive.

Possessing 
great personal style and charisma, Vreeland was an influential and 
valued client of all the major fashion houses and could take her pick.

And now a selection of the fine haute couture that originally belonged to the great doyenne of fashion is going under the hammer.

The extraordinary collection is being put up for sale by a close family friend who received the collection as a gift from Vreeland.

There are many highlights among the carefully crafted items.

One of the most impressive items in the sale is a chic navy wool coat by Yves Saint Laurent that bears the discreet scarlet ribbon of the Legion d’Honneur on the collar.

Star of the show: The Yves Saint Laurent couture be-jewelled crushed velvet evening ensemble specially commissioned by her to wear at the Metropolitan Museum's 'Royal India' exhibition opening of 1985 us expected to fetch £3,000

It was an honour bestowed by the French State for her services to fashion, of which she was immensely proud.

It is expected to fetch between £700 and £1000.

Another coat designed by her friend Mainbocher is lined in black astrakhan to keep out the chill of the harsh New York winters.

The most glamorous ensemble in the group is the Yves Saint Laurent couture bejewelled crushed velvet evening ensemble specially commissioned by her to wear at the Metropolitan Museum’s ‘Royal India’ exhibition opening of 1985.

Encrusted with topaz coloured stones and crystals, the beautiful garment is expected to fetch between £2,000 - £3,000.

Two of the more quirky pieces are a turned ivory art-deco cigarette holder, which she holds in a famous painting by Cecil Beaton, estimated to fetch £400 - £600.

There is also the remains of a the film-director style chair she used in her office at the Met and which bears her DV signature in red, likely to fetch £100 - £150.

Vreeland lived and breathed fashion. 'Everything she did and everything she saw, everyone she talked to, every colour, every vibration she felt was eventually translated into fashion and into Vogue,' said Susan Train of Vogue in a tribute penned to Vreeland in 1989.

Indeed, once her tenure at Vogue came to an end, Vreeland maintained her hold in the fashion world, becoming the 
driving force at the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum and 
organised many ground-breaking exhibitions.
