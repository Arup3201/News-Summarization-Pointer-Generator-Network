We are, if the rumours are to be believed, only weeks away from an official unveiling of the next iPhone.

But a phone company has leaked what it claims is the official front cover of Apple's soon-to-be-released upgrade to its iPhone range, which appears to confirm a larger screen for the bestseller.

This could be Apple's response to other phone companies, who increasingly provide larger 'widescreen' displays for their top models.

The new iPhone 5? These images purport to show the new version of Apple's popular smartphone

How it looked before: The older iPhones sport a 3.5inch screen

Phone repair shop UBreakIFix.com released two images of the 'iPhone 5'.

It follows rumours that the next iPhone will be thinner than ever, with a thickness of 7.6mm, making it two millimetres thinner than the iPhone 4S.

It is believed the iPhone 5 will be announced on September 12, with pre-orders opening immediately.

The phone itself is expected to launch just over a week later on September 21.

However, Apple fans in the UK may have to wait another two weeks until October 5 before getting their hands on a phone.

Apple are notoriously secretive and have not even revealed what they will call their next iPhone. It could be 'iPhone 5', or it may follow this year's spring iPad launch and simply be called 'the new iPhone'.

Last week, more component pictures appeared to confirm the controversial new 'dock connector', the power and data port which has been redesigned - leaving older charger cables and docks useless without adapters.

Leaked: This picture purports to show the the flex cable components for Apple's iPad Mini and iPhone 5 incorporating the new smaller dock connector, headphone jack and home button connector

Change: This picture is believed to show a prototype case for the new iPhone, with its new connector design which is set to make every existing accessory completely obsolete

The photograph, shared by French tech website nowhereelse.fr, shows two components, one of which is said to be similar to another apparently leaked picture of a part of the new iPhone.

As
well as the new dock connector, the part also seems to take in the 
headphone jack and the home button connector for the hotly awaited 
devices.

There was a public outcry when it was revealed that the next iPhone would get a new docking port connector.

The
newer, slimline port means that thousands of current Apple accessories 
will need a potentially clunky adapter to work with the 'iPhone 5' - or 
their devices will become unusable.

Leaks
from the website iMore, which has strong sources 'close to Apple', 
earlier this month suggested the entire next generation of iDevices, 
including the iPod Nano, iPod Touch, iPad Mini and future versions of 
the iPad, will use the new port.

The
site believes a special connector will be released to connect older 
accessories - such as docking stations and speakers - to newer versions 
of the range.

The
'nano-SIM' slot, containing the SIM card which connects a phone to the 
carrier network, has also been redesigned to be thinner, although this 
will be unlikely to cause much disruption to users as networks will 
provide replacements SIMs if necessary.
