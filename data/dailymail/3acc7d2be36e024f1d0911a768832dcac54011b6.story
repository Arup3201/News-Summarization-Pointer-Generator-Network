A cruise ship passenger is lost at sea after climbing over a railing and dropping of the ocean liner Sunday night near the Florida Keys.

Royal Caribbean says the 43-year-old American man was caught on security footage climbing a railing on Deck 12 of the Liberty of the Seas while the ship was sailing 20 miles off the coast of Marathon, Florida and he hasn't been seen since.

Representatives for the cruise line say the man did not fall off the boat accidentally. They say they are not releasing his identity, out of respect for the family. 

Search is on: A man is lost at sea off the coast of the Florida Keys after climbing over a railing on a Royal Caribbean cruise ship Sunday night and going overboard. A passenger on the Liberty of the Seas posted this video of a life boat searching for the missing man

Just miles from port: The as-yet-unidentified man was reported missing 20 miles off the coast of Marathon, Florida Sunday night, as the boat was returning to port in Fort Lauderdale from a trip to Cozumel, Mexico

Vacation gone awry: The Coast Guard continues to search for the man missing at sea. Above, a stock image of Royal Caribbean's Liberty of the Seas

The cruise ship originally aided in the search for the missing passenger, along with a Coast Guard cutter, helicopter and two Canadian Coast Guard ships.

A passenger on the ship posted video of a lifeboat out searching for the missing man Sunday night. 

However, the ship was later cleared to continue with its journey and returned back to Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale early Monday as scheduled.

The ship was on a cruise from Cozumel, Mexico. The Coast Guard is now leading the search.
