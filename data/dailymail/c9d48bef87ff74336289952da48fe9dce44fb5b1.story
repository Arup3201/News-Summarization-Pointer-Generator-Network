The husband of the Michigan mother who was found strangled in her car last month has spoken about the murder, saying he is petrified he will spend the rest of his life in jail for a crime he didn't commit.

Bob Bashara, 54, appeared with his daughter Jessie on Good Morning America and revealed what they thought happened to marketing director Jane Bashara, who disappeared from her home on January 24.

He said: 'I did nothing wrong. I didn't commit murder. I didn't 
pay to have my wife killed. I'm going to see this through to the end. 
And I'm innocent.

'And all the badgering, and all the bad words, and all 
the negativity, I'm going to have to live through.'

Innocent: Bob Bashara and his daughter Jessie spoke to GMA with both insisting Bob had nothing to do with the Michigan mother's murder

New discovery: Police searched the Grosse Pointe property again on Wednesday and found blood in the garage

Deceit: Though they had been married for 26 years, police said Bob was having an affair with a 50-year-old woman

Speaking out for the first time and clutching her father's hand, Jessie said: 'I just know how my mom felt about him, and the way they looked at each other â€¦ all of their disagreements were worked out by talking, communicating. And they were each other's equals.

'There was never any even hint towards violence, or anything like that. It was completely a loving relationship. Without a doubt in my mind, I know that he did not do it.

'There's no way. No fight ever. Just - absolutely not.'

Police again searched the Bashara's Grosse Pointe home on Wednesday and found blood in the garage - something they said they missed in their initial extensive search of the property and the surrounding area.

Bob Bashara said he finds it 'fishy' that it's the first time they found it despite extensively searching the home two weeks ago.

On the day of Jane's memorial service, Joseph Gentz, a man known to the family, turned himself into police and said Bashara pointed a gun to his head and made him kill his wife, something he said he was paid $2,000 for.

It also emerged that Bashara was having an affair with a woman called Rachel Gillette and was planning on buying a house with her.

But he told GMA he had 'no reason' to kill his wife of 26 years and that he loved her very much: 'We had a very good, open relationship. I'm frightened about this. To know that I could spend the rest of my life in jail for a crime I didn't commit is a very scary thing.'

The 54-year-old said he came home to find his wife missing and the lights and TV left on in their home. She was found strangled the next day in her SUV in a Detroit alley.

Bruises on her body and broken finger nails proved she 'fought for her life', according to police.

Bashara said he last spoke to his wife when she was driving home from work but phone records showed no such phone call took place.

The local businessman admitted he and Joe Gentz, 48, had a dispute over a $600 bill and Bashara's attorney believes Gentz may have showed up at his home and demanded money off Jane before getting into a struggle with her.

Police said the mother-of-two was murdered in her home and then dumped in her car.

Her husband told police Gentz's version of events was absurd and said he does not even own a firearm. He told GMA the allegations are a 'sick assessment' that 'shows how deranged he is'.

'I do believe he's the one that did it. 
He wanted more money from me. He badgered me. And yes, I do believe he's
capable of it,' Bashara said.

It has been reported that Gentz has the IQ of a third grader. He told police he turned himself in 
as he did not want to be wholly implicated in the crime but that Bashara
was the mastermind behind it all.

Investigators also confirmed they found an 'S&M sex dungeon' in the basement of a bar Bashara owned called the Hard Luck Lounge.

Fear: Bashara insists he has no reason to kill his wife of 26 years and is petrified of spending his life behind bars

Earlier this week a Detroit dominatrix named Lady Geanna told WXYZ-TV that Bashara hosted S&M sex parties there.

She said: 'Several of my clients or slaves have called me today. Since this has come out I've had like over 20 phone calls.

'They
are all people who have been to his parties and asked if I was involved
with them,' she said on Friday. Some of them were worried there might 
have been hidden cameras, things like that.'

Sources
confirmed the room was filled with whips, chains and a bed and that 
Bashara had been drinking at the Hard Luck Lounge the night his wife was
murdered.

He has denied 
having an affair with Rachel Gilette, despite the fact she has 
cooperated with police and the pair have been pictured together. Bashara
refused to discuss the matter with GMA, saying it had 'nothing to do 
with the case'.

It is believed Jane found out about the affair in the weeks before she was killed.

His attorney has insisted that the couple were in an 'open marriage' and Jane was aware of his relationship.

No arrests have been made in the case.
