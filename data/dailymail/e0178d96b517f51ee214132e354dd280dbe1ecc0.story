It was the BBC programme beloved by children that also gained a cult following from adults.

Teletubbies, the pre-school show that ran from 1997 to 2001, was notable for its bright colours, unusual designs, non-verbal dialogue, and highly memorable characters - Tinky Winky, Dipsy, Laa-Laa and Po.

But who were the people who brought the quirky creatures to life?

Teletubbies, say hello: The pre-school show ran from 1997 to 2001

The actors and actresses inside the costumes were tracked down by Buzzfeed to find out who they are and what they are up to now, 12 years on from when the show ended.

The largest of the 
Teletubbies, handbag carrying Tinky Winky, was played by Simon Shelton, now 47.

He is a a trained ballet 
dancer and choreographer and admitted he was initially reluctant to take on the role that led to him being sent fan mail from adults as well as children and feeling like a member of The Beatles.

'I started my career as a ballet dancer and had just started working as a choreographer. I thought it was a bit of a risky move but it certainly paid off,' he once told The Sun. 'We used to receive a lot of fan mail from kids AND parents. I suppose we were a bit like the Beatles or the Take That of children's television.'

Tinky Winky: Ballet dancer and choreographer Simon Shelton was the man behind the large purple creature

Shelton was not the original Tinky 
Winky. Actor Dave Thompson, who now works as a stand-up comedian, was 
controversially sacked by production company Ragdoll for 
'misinterpreting' the role and implying the Teletubby was gay.

Shelton said it was a question he was frequently asked because of Tinky Winky's penchant for hand bags.

'People always ask me if Tinky Winky 
is gay. But the character is supposed to be a three-year-old so the 
question is really quite silly,' he said.

The 'cool' one: Dipsy was played by stand-up comedian John Simmit

Bright green Dipsy, the 'coolest' Teletubby, who was fond of hats was played by John Simmit, 49, who was and still is a stand-up comedian.

'I was a stand-up before I became 
Dipsy so I carried on doing that when the series came to an end five 
years ago,' he said at the show's ten year anniversary celebrations. 
'The stand-up circuit is pretty close-knit so people got to know that I 
was Dipsy - but I never mentioned it on stage.'

Meanwhile, dancer Nikky Smedley, 49, got the role of Laa-Laa after replying to a newspaper ad.

While the Teletubbies always looked 
like they were having a jolly old time, life in the suit was difficult, Nikky revealed. The 
actors worked 11-hour days and the suits were heavy and hot.

Since the show's conclusion, Nikky's 
contributed to children's TV show Boohbah and choreographed another of 
the BBC's hit children shows, In the Night Garden.

Popular Po: Pui Fan Lee was the actress behind Po; Pui now hosts Show Me, Show Me

Actress Pui Fan Lee, 40, played the cute, red Po. When the 
show ended 12 years ago, the British-Chinese actress moved on to hosting
 CBeebies, the BBC's channel for children aged six and under. Today, she
 presents Show Me, Show Me, which is aimed at pre-school children.

In 2001, Pui stirred some controversy
 after playing a seductive lesbian in the Channel 4 show Metrosexuality.
 Some were shocked when, in one episode, the actress performed a sex act
 with another woman. 

In response, Pui said: 'I didn't 
taken the lesbian role to be deliberately controversial. Yes, I was Po. 
But I am an actress too and the role looked interesting, exciting and 
challenging.'

She added: 
'When we were in the show it was weird because we never dreamed anyone 
would be the slightest bit interested in us. But at the height of our 
popularity there were photographers jumping out of bushes.'
