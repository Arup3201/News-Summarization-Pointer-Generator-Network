Temperatures are set to plummet over the Bank Holiday weekend, falling to as low as -3C as a blast of cold air moves in from the Arctic and potentially lasts for up to a fortnight.

Forecasters say that parts of Britain will experience heavy overnight frosts, with the North facing a windchill factor of -5C and the potential for snow on hilltops by the end of the week.

The impending cold snap follows one of the mildest winters in recent years, although the wettest January for 250 years led to widespread flooding - particularly in the South-West.

Speaking to the MailOnline, Met Office spokesman Simon Partridge said high pressure building up in the North would cause rainfall, although the Bank Holiday weekend itself is expected to be dry.

Colder air will begin moving down from the North on Wednesday, reaching southern England by the weekend and causing heavy frosts, he added.

'In fact we've been telling gardeners over the last few days that they should move new or vulnerable plants indoors if possible,' Mr Partridge said.

Jonathan Powell, forecaster for Vantage Weather, told the Express: 'We are looking at northerly flow of air coming in from the Arctic. With windchill this could push thermometers as low a -5C.'

'Temperatures are going to sink decidedly below average for the time of year, with the risk of very sharp frosts and a cold and bracing Bank Holiday next Monday'.

'This is certainly looking like the last taste of winter and it could hold out like this for at least the next week and perhaps up to two,' he added.

The predicted cold snap contradicts forecasts from earlier in the month that said Britain was set for a six-week heatwave from the end of April and into May.

A Met Office report read: 'Latest predictions for UK-mean temperature favour above-average temperatures for April and April-May as a whole.'

The warm conditions had been expected to bring a quarter of a million visitors to the South-West - providing a Â£54million boost for local businesses that were badly hit by flooding earlier in the year.
