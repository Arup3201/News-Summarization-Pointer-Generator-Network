This is the astonishing 'glass' frog which manages to elude its predators with its see through skin - rendering it almost invisible.

The Fleischmann's Glass Frog looks as if it is changing colour as it moves, as the background shows through its transparent flesh.

The bizarre camouflage means you can still see its heart, intestines, and red blood vessels.

Predators don't have a hop in hell of seeing this crafty frog - whose see through skin makes it almost invisible

Photographer Thomas Marent snapped the frogs - with bulging yellow eyes - underneath leaves at a nature reserve in Choco, Colombia.

One can even be seen sitting next to her transparent eggs, where the heads and tails of developing tadpoles can be clearly seen inside.

Mr Marent, 46, said: 'I was looking on the underside of leaves when I found a beautiful female glass frog moistening a clutch of eggs attached to the leaf.

'This is is extremely rare.

'The tadpoles inside the eggs were already well developed, and it was almost time for them to hatch.

'Nearby I also found two beautiful males of the same species. These frogs normally look small and green when viewed from above.

Despite it's amazing camouflage you can still see its heart, intestines, and red blood vessels

'However, the skin covering their undersides and extremities is largely unpigmented and very thin in places.

'That means it is possible to see the blood vessels running through the body, and even the the internal organs working away inside.

'Background colours show through the frogs minute bodies, helping them stay out of sight among the green leaves.'

Mr Marent, from Baden, Switzerland, said the frog returned to her eggs regularly to add a protective coat of mucus, which keeps them moist and protects against fungus and parasites.

He added: 'It is hard to tell which part of this frog is pigmented green and which areas are coloured by the leaves showing through its transparent skin.'
