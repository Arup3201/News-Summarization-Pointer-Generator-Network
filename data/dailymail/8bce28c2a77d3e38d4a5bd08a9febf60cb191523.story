President Obama's former bag carrier and 'chief of stuff' has joined David Cameron's election team and will be tasked with winning the Prime Minister a second term in office.

Reggie Love, a former US college basketball star, dubbed 'iReggie' by Obama, was the president's ever-present companion and source of information on the campaign trail and in the Oval Office.

Sources have revealed that Mr Love, 33, has teamed up with Jim Messina, the Obama campaign manager in 2012, with the Tories hoping their two latest recruits will help steer the party to victory.

The pair have both made several trips to London recently - and have had at least one meeting with David Cameron, The Times reports.

Mr Love, assigned to 'field and social media' work for the Conservatives, completed a masters degree in business administration after leaving the White House.

He was a star basketball player at college and played forward for the Duke Blue Devils - playing on the 2001 side that won the NCAA national championship.

Mr Love, who is 6ft 5in, recently published a book about his time with the President called Power Forward.

In it he writes: 'I was his DJ, his Kindle, his travel agent, his valet his daughters basketball coach, his messenger, his punching bag, his alarm clock, his vending machine, his chief of stuff, his note passer, his spades partner, his caterer, his small forward, his buffer, his gatekeeper, his surrogate son, and ultimately, improbably, luckily, his friend.'

As Obama's assistant he travelled almost 900,000 miles at the president's side and formed such a close bond with him that he had two tattoos dedicated to his election triumphs.

Inked on each bicep he has the numbers 365 and 332 - representing the number of electoral votes Obama won on election nights in 2008 and 2012.

'I am an extra set of hands, if he ever needs it,' Mr Love once said of his responsibilities. 

'Anything I can do to make life just a little bit easier is, you know, part of my job.' 

Reggie Love has been recruited to help steer the Tories to victory in May's General Election.

The former US college basketball star, 33, served as the president's special assistant and personal aide, commonly referred to as the body man for taking care of the president's needs during Obama's campaign trails.

During these times, Mr Love was rarely seen far from the president's side and claimed he filled the role of everything from Obama's 'punchbag' to his 'vending machine' - with the president affectionately referring to him as his 'little brother'.

He left his position in the White House in 2011 to complete a masters degree in business administration.

Along with another of Obama's former advisers Jim Messina, he has made several trips to London recently and has met with David Cameron.

Mr Love and Jim Messina are not the only Americans to have been recruited for May's General Election.

David Axelrod, the former senior adviser to President Obama, has been working as an election strategist for Labour. 

The veteran politician worked with Mr Love and Mr Messina in the Oval Office during Obama's first term as president.

But with 88 days until the election, Ed Miliband is set to lose the American guru for a month when Mr Axelrod embarks on a tour promoting his new book detailing his career in politics.

The memoir, titled Believer, is released in the US next week and as a result the Labour adviser will be on the road for most of February.

Along with Reggie Love, the Tories have recruited Jim Messina to help steer the party to victory in May. 

The political adviser was the former White House Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations from 2009 to 2011 and served as the campaign manager for Obama's successful 2012 re-election campaign.

Meanwhile, one of his former Oval Office colleagues, David Axelrod, is working for Labour. 

Mr Axelrod, who was also employed in the White House with Reggie Love, was a top political adviser to Bill Clinton and a chief campaign adviser to Obama during the 2008 campaign.

In a blow to Ed Miliband, the American political guru is set to disappear for a month just 88 days before the General Election, as he embarks on a tour to promote his new memoir, Believer.
