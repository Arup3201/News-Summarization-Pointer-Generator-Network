A fire that destroyed one building of a Muslim center in Houston is thought to have been set on purpose.

Authorities said that someone used an accelerant in the 5am Friday blaze at the Quba Islamic Institute, according to one of the imams's 25-year-old son Ahsan Zahid.

Mr Zahid said that an investigator told him that the incident was a suspected arson, and that the fire was not an accident.

The fire, which completely destroyed the contents of a storage shed, is thought to have been an arson and may be investigated as a hate crime

Houston Fire Department said it was investigating and could not yet name the cause of the fire.

The FBI said Saturday that they are monitoring the situation and could take a more active role in the investigation, according to Reuters.

The Council on American Islamic Relations's Texas office has called for possible hate crime motivations to be looked at in the investigation.

Federal agencies are expected to become more involved if that is the case.

No injuries were reported in the fire, which largely took place in a storage building and is thought to have caused $100,000 in damage.

The blaze started at 5am and caused an expected $100,000 worth of damage before firefighters were able to put it out

The Houston Fire Department is still investigating the cause of the fire, though they told Mr Zahid that it did not start by accident

The contents of the building, which housed the institute's computers, lights and equipment for a renovation, were completely destroyed.

The center has a place to pray, holds community events, offers Arabic classes and also runs a Sunday School.

The Quba Islamic Institute is asking for donations through their website qubahouston.org, and MR Zahid told Daily Mail Online that they had raised $2,500 as of Saturday afternoon. 

The institute said a man had driven past the institute and mockingly yelled 'Allah' on Thursday.

A man with a covered face was chased away from the building earlier in the week.

The Muslim center had been scheduled to host a talk by a former Guantanamo Bay guard who converted to Islam after the experience, Terry Holdbrooks, on Friday night.

Mr Zahid said that the event took place despite the fire and that 'all programs, activities, and prayers have, and will continue as scheduled'.

The institute's Facebook page has also come under attack from posters who have insulted Islam repeatedly on posts where the center is explaining what happened in the fire.

The Islamic Institute used its Facebook page to reach out for donations and ask for tolerance in the wake of the fire, but their posts soon saw an influx of anti-Muslim commenters

Two suspicious incidents happened in the week leading up to the fire, including a man with a covered face who had to be chased away from the building

The center's Facebook account responded to abuse on Facebook by thanking offensive users for their perspective

The institute defended itself against the Islamophobic posts by thanking the users for their perspective and urging tolerance.

The possible hate crime follows on the death of three Muslim students in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, that federal investigators are looking into for motives of religious hatred.

Deah Shaddy Barakat, 23; his wife, Yusor Mohammad Abu-Salha, 21, and her sister, Razan Mohammad Abu-Salha, 19, were buried Thursday. 

Texas has the US's eighth-largest population of Muslims, according to the Texas State Historical Association 

The annual Texas Muslim Capitol Day in Austin was targeted by anti-Islam protesters last month, the Los Angeles Times reported.

In 2011 the Houston Fire Department said that someone had deliberately set fire to a mosque on the other side of the city.
