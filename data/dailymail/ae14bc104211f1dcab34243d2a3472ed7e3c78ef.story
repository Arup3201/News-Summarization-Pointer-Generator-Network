After three-and-a-half years playing baseball for New Jersey's Drew University, a star player has come out to his teammates as he approaches his final season.

Matt Kaplon, 21, didn't want to play a single inning in the last season of his college career until his team knew exactly who he is.

As society becomes more and more accepting of homosexuality, there is still one arena in which it's a taboo: sports.

Coming clean: Kaplon decided to tell his teammates that he is gay

Kaplon was painfully aware of that as he gathered his teammates together last weekend to make his announcement.

'Growing up in sports, you kind of hear this stigma that being gay isn't OK,' Kaplon told OutSports. 'That traveled with me into college.'

And yet, he was buoyed by the recent coming out of college footballer Conner Mertens at Williamette University and Hillsdale College basketballer Derek Schell, the latter of whom he has become close friends with.

Relieved: Kaplon feels that his friendships are stronger than ever since his revelation

'Words cannot describe what Derek has meant to me,' Kaplon told OutSports. 'He saved my life.'

Kaplon says that throughout his high school and college career, he'd heard homophobic slurs like 'faggot' or 'sissy' on-field, which served to further his retreat from the truth.

He finally decided to come out to his family and friends after an experience last year.

After being pursued, fruitlessly, by a young woman acquaintance, Kaplon was asked by his puzzled best friend, 'Are you gay?'

Kaplon told him he wasn't.

'I lied to my best friend about myself,' he told OutSports. 'It made me think a lot about who I was and who I was going to be.'

Weeks later he told the truth about his sexuality to his friend, whose positive reaction along with that of other friends and family members, convinced Kaplon that it was time to tell his teammates.

Last weekend, as the team gathered in a classroom before going out to do community service together, Kaplon's coach Brian Hirschberg told the team there was something Kaplon wanted to tell them.

He stood before his expectant teammates and said the words, 'I'm gay.'

Being himself: After three-and-a-half years with his teammates, Kaplon didn't want to play another inning without being honest about himself to them

For a brief moment, Kaplon feared the worst from the silence that met his announcement.

Then one teammate got up and shook his hand, saying, 'That was the manliest thing I've ever seen.'

Applause followed and now, Kaplon finally feels that his team knows the real him.

'It's amazing to see how much more real your friendships become when you open up to them and let them know who you are,' Kaplon told OutSports.

It's a sentiment his teammates echo.

'It's one of the best things he's ever done because it's made us closer friends. It doesn't change a thing. If anything, since he told me this really personal thing we've started hanging out more and talking about more serious things,' said second baseman Anthony Feltre.
