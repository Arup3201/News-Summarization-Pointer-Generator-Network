A 33-year-old Irish man who had been living in Australia for almost two years has vanished from a Sydney street in broad daylight in a crowded shopping area.

Up to 100 young people from the Irish community in Sydney's Bondi are searching the streets for Donal 'Donie’ O’ Sullivan, who is one of eight brothers and sisters from Clooney in Western Ireland. He has been living in Australia since June 2012.

Donie was last seen around 10.30am on Saturday on Bronte Road, Bondi Junction, walking in the direction of the Cock ‘n Bull Bar on Ebley Street.

MissingZ: Donie O'Sullivan, 33, has disappeared after a night out in Sydney

He had returned from an all night party in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs with one of his housemates and was looking for something to eat before returning to his home, just minutes away.

Donie, who shared a house with his younger brother Johnnie, and two other young Irish nationals, is regarded as reliable.

By Sunday night, his brother, and flatmates Amy Croffey and Jerry Calahane were worried enough to report him missing to Waverley Police Station.

They said a woman police officer did not regard the case as serious and they had to return again to the station to speak with other officers a day later.

On Monday morning, Donie usually picked up his fellow workmates at around 4am to drive the two hours to the Australian capital, Canberra, where they spent the week working as pipe layers for Sydney company, KNF.

Donie didn't turn up, and the company vehicle he used for the drive was still parked outside his shared Bondi house.

Police are studying CCTV footage which shows Donie leaving Bondi's Teagardens Hotel that morning and walking along the road.

The MailOnline understands he was refused entry to the nearby Cock ‘n Bull Bar and was captured on street security cameras leaning against a stop sign at 10.17am.

Thereafter, there were no sightings, although an unconfirmed report suggests  Donie telephoned a friend at around midday.

Police have now stepped up their efforts him. On Monday night, Donie's flatmates met with other young Irish nationals in the Cock ‘n Bull Bar and spread out over Sydney's Eastern and Inner City suburbs searching for him and putting up 'missing' posters with his photograph.

O'Sullivan is described as five foot ten or 180cm, of stocky build, with light brown hair. He was last seen wearing a pink t-shirt, blue jeans and white runners.

Johnnie O'Sullivan told the MailOnline his brother was a 'friendly, happy-go-lucky person, but reliable'.

'I don't have any clues as to what could have happened.'

As the missing man's sister and brother-in-law, Anne and Liam O'Hare prepare to fly out from Ireland, Johnnie O'Sullivan and other young Irish friends are going out on further searches for Donie.

Flatmate Amy Croffey told the MailOnline Donie 'loved Australia, loved Sydney and was planning to stay here'. Donie was working in Australia as a sponsored immigrant.

A friend of the missing man described it as 'really out of character for Donie. He never misses work and has never done anything like this before'.

The Department of Foreign Affairs spokesman said they were aware of the case and were providing consular assistance to the family through the Consulate General in Sydney.
