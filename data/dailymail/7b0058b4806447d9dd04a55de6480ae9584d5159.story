A criminal has been awarded a £19,000 taxpayer funded compensation payout after he hurt himself clambering over a gate during unpaid work.

The settlement is part of  an estimated £500,000-per-year of compensation payments made to offenders who slip and fall during their community service.

The unnamed criminal in West Mercia was handed a compensation cheque for £19,773 when he was injured in a fall as he tried to climb over a wooden gate while doing his unpaid work.

While in Humberside a total of £2,400 was paid to an offender who fell off a ladder and then claimed he hadn't been given proper instructions on how to use it.

Probation services can be made to pay out if it is shown that they were negligent in that they didn't supervise the criminals properly, such as warning them about dangers or providing them with appropriate equipment.

In South Yorkshire a criminal doing community service was paid £1,300 after he hurt himself lifting equipment onto a trailer. The legal costs in the case added another £8,250 to the bill for the probation service.

An offender doing a work placement in London was paid £11,000 after a heavy concrete object fell on their foot. The criminal won their case on the basis that probation workers didn't provide enough supervision.

There were also payouts of £4,000 to an offender by York and North Yorkshire Probation Trust and £10,500 to a criminal by Wales Probation Trust for injuries sustained while doing community payback work.

Probation staff also managed to sue their employers for damages when things went wrong. One claimed £12,000 after being attacked by an offender while in Wales £11,000 was paid to a member of staff hurt while at work.

Devon and Cornwall Probation Trust paid £150,000 to a former staff member who successfully said that working conditions had caused them psychiatric damage. The Trust also paid £6,000 to another employee who hurt their knee getting out the back of a van.

In a previous year it was reported how one criminal picked up £73,000 in compensation after they sprained their ankle while clearing brambles.

Across the whole country it is estimated around £500,000-per-year is being paid by probation trusts to settle compensation claims brought against it by criminals and employees.

The Ministry of Justice have said that they 'robustly' defend all claims for compensation from offenders

Peter Cuthbertson, Director at the Centre for Crime Prevention, said: 'Victims will be sickened by some of these payouts.

'Already community service is usually an expensive waste of taxpayers' money, failing to protect the public or stop re-offending. It is morally obscene if it also becomes a way for criminals to cheat the taxpayer of thousands.'

A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: 'This Government has no intention of paying compensation when there is no good reason to do so and robustly defends all cases, as far as the evidence allows. Vexatious claims are always challenged and any payments are only made following clear legal advice.

'Community Payback is there to ensure that offenders make reparation to the community for the crimes they have committed.'
