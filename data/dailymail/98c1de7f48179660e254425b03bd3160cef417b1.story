Two detectives who dealt with a sex crime claim against Jimmy Savile in 2008 have been referred to the police watchdog.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said it has directed Sussex Police to refer the conduct of the pair over their handling of the alleged indecent assault.

A woman came forward in March 2008 to claim that disgraced television presenter Savile assaulted her in a caravan in around 1970 when she was in her early 20s.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission said it has directed Sussex Police to refer the conduct of two detectives over their handling of the alleged indecent assault by Jimmy Savile

This was referred to prosecutors with three other allegations against the performer received by Surrey Police, but in 2009 the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided no action could be taken.

Earlier this year, the CPS criticised Sussex and Surrey police forces for being 'unjustifiably cautious' and failing to properly investigate the allegations.

Alison Levitt QC found that 'had the police and prosecutors taken a different approach' prosecutions could have been possible in relation to three victims.

The two officers were referred to as DS O and DC T in Ms Levitt's report, and came under fire for wrongly telling the alleged victim that her claims would need to be corroborated before any prosecution.

Earlier this year, the CPS criticised Sussex and Surrey police forces for being 'unjustifiably cautious' and failing to properly investigate the allegations.

She withdrew her support for police action because she feared she would struggle to find the information they said they needed, for example contact details for people she knew at the time.

Ms Levitt said: 'Looking at the documents created in 2008 I found it difficult not to conclude that the officers had, even if unintentionally, dissuaded her from pursuing her allegation.

'Insofar as she was led to believe that "corroboration" was required before a prosecution could take place, this was wrong as a matter of law.'

The woman told Ms Levitt that DC T had said court action would be difficult because Savile was a 'big celebrity', and that the officer told her the late DJ's wealth meant he would have top lawyers who would make 'mincemeat' of her.

A spokesman for Sussex Police said: 'In February this year we received a request from the IPCC, seeking relevant documents and our view on the potential for any police misconduct investigation, in relation to the 2008 sexual offence allegation against the late Jimmy Savile.

'We sent a full response to the IPCC in March and received a letter from them on November 1 requiring us to record a misconduct matter in relation to both officers referred to, and to refer it back to the IPCC for their decision on how it should be investigated.

'We will comply with that requirement and work with the IPCC on any next steps. The two officers continue their normal duties in Sussex Police at this time and have not been suspended.'
