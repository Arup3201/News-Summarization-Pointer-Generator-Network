Australians travelling to Indonesia have been advised to exercise a high degree of caution after Foreign Minister Julie Bishop confirmed she has received information about planned acts of terror.

The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have issued a warning to Australians to exercise a high degree of caution if travelling Indonesia, including popular tourist spot Bali.

The Australian Government says it is receiving information which indicates that terrorists may be planning attacks in Indonesia, which could take place at any time.

Julie Bishop confirmed that the Government is working 'very closely' with Indonesian security, intelligence and law enforcement agencies and are preparing for the worst.

The alarm was first raised after the US Government was warned about threats against US-associated hotels and banks in Surabaya in East Java.

'Australia is monitoring this situation very closely,' Bishop said at a press conference, confirming that DFAT is in partnership with Indonesian security, intelligence and law enforcement agencies.

Ms Bishop emphasised that the risk is very real and Australians must act cautiously when travelling overseas, as we have already experienced 'incidents in the past where Australians were killed'.

She used the example of the tragic deaths of 45 Australians in the 2002 Bali Bombings and 88 Australians in the 2005 Bali bombings as stark reminders that 'the threat of terror activity anywhere in the world remains.'

'That is why we count terrorism as our major national security threat,' said Ms Bishop.

It is a major priority for the government to prepare adequately to prevent or react to potential terror attacks, 'to keep Australians safe here and overseas'.

'We're taking steps to make sure our intelligence agencies and our law enforcement agencies are well-resourced... (and) have the funding and personnel they require.'

The smart traveller warning for Indonesia advises that there are known terrorist groups which remain active throughout Indonesia, despite police disruptions. 

'Police continue to conduct operations against these groups and have stated publicly that terrorist suspects remaining at large may seek to attack Western targets.'

The Foreign Minister advised Australians to follow all advice given by the Australia Government by paying close attention to Smart Traveller updates.

'We're taking steps to make sure our intelligence agencies and our law enforcement agencies are well-resourced and have the funding and personnel they require,' Ms Bishop told media on Tuesday

'Of course in all these situations, people should be very aware of the fact that they are in another country, they're subject to the laws of another country,' Ms Bishop added.

'And if you can't afford to travel to Bali with travel insurance, then perhaps you should rethink your travel.'

The US government on Sunday warned of a potential threat against US-associated hotels and banks in Surabaya.

'You should exercise particular caution around locations that have a low level of protective security and avoid places known to be possible terrorist targets,' the department says in its latest travel advice.

The advice also notes Indonesian immigration staff may refuse entry to Australians with a criminal record, regardless of how long ago the offence took place. 

Ms Bishop has advised Australians to always execute caution when overseas and to be mindful that they are subject to the laws of another country, of which they may not be aware
