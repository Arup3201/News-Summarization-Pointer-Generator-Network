'You may be right': Rupert Murdoch responded to a Twitter user's comments: 'Seriously, we are all so over Page 3'

The days of topless models on Page 3 on The Sun newspaper  may be numbered after Rupert  Murdoch agreed they were ‘last century’.

The News Corp boss said last night that bare-breasted women on Page 3 had become outdated during an extraordinary Twitter exchange.

A Twitter user known only as @Kazipooh told the newspaper magnate: ‘Seriously, we are all so over Page 3 – it is so last century.’

The 81-year-old promptly replied: ‘You may be right, don’t know but considering.’

Mr Murdoch went on to suggest that he had been thinking about other options to modernise the photos and appease the critics who argue the feature is demeaning to women.

He added: ‘Perhaps halfway house with glamorous fashionistas.’

Last night the pressure group,  No More Page 3, celebrated the hint that The Sun’s Page 3 girls may be on the way out. 

Lucy-Anne Holmes began the group last year, setting up a change.org petition to encourage people to appeal to editor Dominic Mohan to ‘take the bare breasts out of The Sun’.

She tweeted from the group’s account: ‘We’re really pleased that @rupertmurdoch might be thinking about dropping pg 3 – it’s down to everyone who signed the petition & supported us.’

She said the group had gathered 64,305 signatures. 

Mr Murdoch’s comments come almost a year after Germany’s biggest selling tabloid Bild decided to drop its controversial ‘Page 1 girls’ to honour International Women’s Day.

The newspaper, which had featured a naked woman on its front page since 1984, called the move ‘perhaps a  small step from women’s point of view – but it’s a big step for Bild and all men in Germany’.

The Sun began publishing Page 3 girls in 1970, but in recent years the tabloid newspaper has come under increasing criticism for portraying women as sex objects.
