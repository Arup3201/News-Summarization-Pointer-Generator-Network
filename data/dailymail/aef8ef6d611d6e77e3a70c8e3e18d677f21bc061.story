West Ham are waiting on Cheikhou Kouyate to decide his future after making a bid for the Anderlecht defender.

Valencia are the main competition as they have matched the offer and look set to bring in some big names over the summer.

Offer: West Ham have made a bid for 24-year-old Anderlecht defender Cheikhou Kouyate

The 24-year-old Senegal international joined Anderlecht in 2008 on a free transfer and was a key figure for the Belgian club last season, making six Champions League starts.

Kouyate was part of the Senegal squad at the London 2012 Olympics and helped them reach the quarter-finals, in which they lost 4-2 to Mexico after extra time.
