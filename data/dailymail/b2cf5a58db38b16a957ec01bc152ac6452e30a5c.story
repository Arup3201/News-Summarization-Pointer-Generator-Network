Staring at myself in the mirror, I’m shocked to see how different I look compared to five minutes ago. My eyes appear more intense, my face paler.

I’m thinking Scandinavian, I’m thinking Queen Elizabeth I, but brow expert Sohan Chong puts her finger on it. ‘Weird,’ she announces, staring at my new bleached eyebrows. ‘They bring out the blue of your eyes, although you do look a bit like an alien.’

Eyebrows have become 2014’s most confusing beauty story. At the beginning of the year the ‘Scouse brow’ — the high-arched, pencilled-in look so beloved by Liverpool ladies, WAGs and TOWIE women — was still in fashion.

Then model-of-the-moment Cara Delevingne’s unkempt version took off and we were all meant to walk around looking like we’d never seen a tweezer in our lives. Apparently, a brave few even tried the Vulcan brow, which is exactly as it sounds — curiously angled brows inspired by Star Trek’s Spock. Thankfully, they never really took off.

Finally, last month Cara sashayed down the Givenchy runway at Paris Fashion Week with her iconic eyebrows bleached, hailing the arrival of the ‘No Brow’.

Yes, you read that correctly, when it comes to grooming, fashionable women are increasingly skipping the tweezers and reaching for the peroxide instead and bleaching out their brows completely.

Suman Jalaf from Neville Hair And Beauty in Knightsbridge, West London — who works with Poppy Delevingne, Suki Waterhouse and Kelly Brook — says there is a trend towards intense eyebrow maintenance because a groomed brow offers ‘the cheapest alternative to a facelift. They define your features and frame your face.’

But which look should I go for? I went to one of London’s top hair salons to find out.

I must admit my eyebrows are worrying me. While I’ve always had naturally thick, curly hair, at 48 my eyebrows have started to look thin. They are still OK at the nose end but, towards my ears, the hairs seem to peter out.

I haven’t dared pluck them or touch my eyebrows with a pencil in years, hoping that people will be distracted by my hair. I’m not sure they’re ready for the spotlight.

At the Jo Hansford salon in London, things get off to a bad start when the redoubtable Jo — hair colourist to everyone from the Duchess of Cornwall to Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie — inspects the guinea pig.

‘You don’t have many eyebrows to speak of!’ she declares, before walking off. Ouch.

It’s only when Sohan Chong appears that I relax. She takes one look and says: ‘They’re not thinning at all. They just need tidying up.’ I feel a weight taken off my shoulders. Maybe I am normal after all.

Half of Sohan’s clients complain of balding brows. ‘They stop growing so well once you reach 40,’ she says, because of dropping levels of oestrogen. ‘And lots of young girls over-pluck them.’

Sohan’s brows are arched and well-defined. The type a cool corporate lawyer might sport. She tells me they’re part-hair and part-tattoo. Sohan offers customers a tattoo service for £400 that needs touching up once every six months.

It sounds tempting, but I don’t feel ready to commit yet. Instead, I’m escorted to the basins where Jo is going to peroxide my brows.

Stephanie wasn't a fan of the bleached look which she said made her look like an alien

The process works the same way as other hair bleaching: a hydrogen peroxide paste is painted onto my eyebrows, which seeps into the hair shaft and disperses the colour molecules. The more colour molecules that get dispersed, the lighter your hair will become.

It feels cold and slightly tingly but quite comfortable, and 20 minutes later I am declared ‘done’. Jo returns with a warm cloth and wipes the bleach off. ‘You look like you don’t have any brows now!’ she says, with a booming laugh.

I’m sensing she’s not a fan of my new look which, she tells me, has been copied by several ‘trendy types’ since Cara made her statement. But in general most people still do want to go the other way, i.e. dye blonde brows darker so their faces appear more striking, like Rita Ora and Jayne Mansfield.

Bleached or dark, there is no doubt women are paying much more attention to their brows nowadays. Many tend to get a ‘brow do’ at the same time as their hair, a service that costs £15. ‘Good eyebrows make you look healthy and feel confident,’ Sohan says.

A report by market research company NPD Group shows that sales of brow products rose by 52 per cent between January and May.

When I see mine in the mirror, I get a shock. Sohan’s right: bleached brows do bring out the colour of my eyes. And they emphasise my forehead as there’s nothing separating my eyes from my hairline.

At home, my boyfriend informs me I look less like Elizabeth I and more like Robocop, with his helmet removed. He’s got a point.

It doesn’t take me long to figure out the No Brow look just doesn’t suit me — if indeed it suits anyone. Katy Perry soon went back to black after dabbling with the No Brow this summer, as did Cara after the Givenchy show.

I decide the blonde look is too bizarre even for the 21st century. Possibly in a spirit of over- compensation, I return to the salon and ask Sohan to give me the alternative Scouse Brow.

She tells me she prefers to call it a ‘Power Brow’ and begins drawing over my brows with a heavy black pencil, going slightly over the edge of my natural shape.

As a guideline, the natural shape should be followed when creating a ‘Power Brow’, but Sohan says ‘don’t worry about elongating the thin end’, as this look is about being overly dramatic.

I was prepared to hate it, but the big black brows against blonde hair make me feel powerful — like Madonna circa the Blond Ambition tour. Yet as I cycle home, I’m aware of an older woman looking at me quizzically at the traffic lights.

At the local corner shop I jokingly ask two twentysomething office workers if they think my big brows look ridiculous.

‘What do you mean?’ says one of them blankly, as if I’m an idiot. ‘That’s what eyebrows are supposed to look like these days, isn’t it? It’s down to that Cara de la whatshername.’

I’m glad I’ve put myself through the eyebrow mill. I never realised there was so much potential in an eyebrow and I’ve learned that they really are important, more important than mascara on lashes for lighting up your eyes and face.

Stephanie says the the big black brows against blonde hair make her feel more powerful

Next month, London’s eyebrow queen, Vaishaly Patel — whose clients include Gwyneth Paltrow, Nigella Lawson and Elle MacPherson — will be pioneering ‘eyebrow extensions’ where synthetic hair is stuck onto existing brows. It lasts for up to three weeks and costs £60. She’ll also offer a stick-on brow service.

Although the full-on Cara may be a step too far, I will definitely pay more attention to my eyebrows in future, and have booked an appointment with Jo Hansford to get my brows tinted back to my natural shade. If I’m brave enough, I might even try a tattoo top-up, but am still undecided.

I’ve always prided myself on being low maintenance in the beauty department, but have decided to add brows to my bi-monthly hair colouring treat.

I hope it’s not the start of a slippery slope!
