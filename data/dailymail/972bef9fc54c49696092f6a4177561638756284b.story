Stoke manager Mark Hughes believes his side can now compete with the best clubs in Europe for some of the game's big names.

On Tuesday Hughes signed Germany international and Bayer Leverkusen defender Philipp Wollscheid on loan until the end of the season, with a view to a permanent move in the summer.

More surprisingly, Stoke were this week linked with a club-record deal for Swiss star Xherdan Shaqiri, who instead signed on loan for Inter Milan from Bayern Munich ahead of a £12million summer switch.

It was no cheeky attempt by Hughes to snatch Shaqiri, who was also linked with Liverpool and City's Barclays Premier League opponents on Sunday in Arsenal.

Hughes feels it is a measure of how far Stoke have come throughout his tenure that agents are willing to listen to his overtures rather than snub the club.

'We get the opportunity to discuss things at that level now, and I don't think that was the case here before,' said Hughes.

'It's fair to say in the past we've said to agents 'we could be interested' and the response has always been 'don't bother'.

'That was probably the case in previous years, but that's certainly changed in my time here.

'We've brought different types of players here and players talk. They understand what we're trying to do, the football grapevine is everywhere and we become an option.

'Of course, we need to be in the top half of the table, that's the key to it, and if you're a consistent team you are an attraction.

'Don't underestimate the power of the Premier League as well. We can offer a good club, a well-run club, with good players already here.

'It's a good environment, a good situation to come into, with an opportunity to progress if you do well, so we've a lot to offer if you look at all the boxes we tick.'

It remains to be seen if Wollscheid will be given his debut against Arsenal, although given Stoke's record away to the Gunners they need all the help they can muster.

Stoke have lost on their last 12 visits, be it at Highbury or the Emirates, with their last success in that part of north London dating all the way back to 1981.

Hughes is hoping the stunning 3-2 success over Arsene Wenger's side just five weeks ago at the Britannia Stadium in early December will play a part.

'If you look at our record at Arsenal it isn't great, and neither is my own personal record with other teams before Stoke,' said Hughes.

'But this is an opportunity for us as we're playing them quickly after a very positive performance and result last month.

'Hopefully, from a psychological point of view, it might help us more than Arsenal. We hope it's a benefit.

'We certainly have to improve our record down there, and if we are to do that then we have to force them to work harder than they have done in the past.'

Hughes has four players on the brink of a comeback from injury in defenders Marc Muniesa and Marc Wilson, midfielder Victor Moses and striker Bojan Krkic.
