Packaged vegetable juice, yogurt and and ketchup are some of the foods which contain high levels of stealth sugars. 

And if you're feeling  virtuous about your healthy breakfast of wholegrain cereal washed down with a glass of orange juice, you might want to stop being so smug. 

Health conscious consumers are likely to shun sweet treats but  some seemingly healthier options are actually more sugar-laden than we realise.  

Stealth sugars are sneaking their way into our diets, sending our intake soaring above recommended limits (Picture posed by model)

Choose water or unsweetened fruit juice instead of sugary fizzy drinks and juice drinks. Remember to dilute these for children 

If you like fizzy drinks, try diluting fruit juice with sparking water

Swap cakes or biscuits for a currant bun, scone or some malt loaf with low-fat spread

If you take sugar in hot drinks or add sugar to breakfast cereal, gradually reduce the amount until you can cut it out altogether

Rather than spreading jam, marmalade, syrup, treacle or honey on your toast, try a low-fat spread, sliced banana or low-fat cream cheese

Check nutrition labels to help pick the foods with less added sugar, or opt for low-sugar versions

Try halving the sugar you use in recipes, it works for most things, except jam, meringues and ice cream

Choose tins of fruit in juice rather than syrup

Choose wholegrain breakfast cereals, but not those coated with sugar or honey

A bowl of Bran Flakes plus a glass of orange juice will account for half your recommended daily amount of sugar.

Our everyday diets are packed with ‘stealth’ sugar, sending our intake far above the recommended limits, which according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), should be no more than 12 teaspoons a day.

Raisins are very sugary, as are flavoured fat-free yoghurts.

And one tablespoon of ketchup can contain as much as one teaspoon of sugar. 

Some bottled juices and smoothies have as much as 47g of sugar, a lot to consume in just one sitting. 

Like ketchup, tomato-based pasta sauces and soups also have sugar added to them to balance out the acidity of tomatoes.

While cereal and granola bars may have a reputation for being healthy, they too are usually much sweeter than they need to be.  

Sugar is also found in surprisingly large amounts in many savoury foods such as sauces and ready meals.

In fact, sugar highly likely to be a much bigger part of your diet than you realise.

Surprisingly, ‘healthier’ reduced-fat foods can actually contain more sugar than their full fat counterparts, as stripping out fats from processed foods makes them less appealing to our tastebuds.

To combat the lack of flavour, manufacturers increase the levels of sugar in the food.

In an investigation for MailOnline, nutritionist Angela Dowden said:' UK guidelines recommend that ‘added’ sugars — those used to sweeten food, fizzy drinks, honeys, syrups and fruit juices — shouldn’t make up more than 10 per cent of the total energy we get from food.

'This is around 50g of sugar a day, equivalent to ten cubes of sugar for adults and older children, and nine for five to ten-year-olds.

Think you're having a healthy breakfast? Think again. Even bran flakes contain stealth sugars (Picture posed by model)

Tomato based sauces such as Dolmio (left) and tomato ketchup (right) have added sugars to balance acidity

But when even a 'healthy salad contains two cubes of sugar, are we fighting a losing battle? 

'Remember, we’re talking about sugar added as a sweetener,' she continued. 

'The sugars in milk, vegetables and pieces of fruit (as opposed to fruit juice), including dried fruit, do not wreak as much havoc.'

A report by WHO revealed the current average intake of free sugars in North and Central America is 95g a day (19 teaspoons) rising to 130g (26 teaspoons) a day in South America.

There are 3.5 cubes of sugar in Tropicana's smooth orange juice (left) and half a cube in Naked's Green Machine juice (right)

Muller Light Strawberry yogurt (left) contains 2.5 cubes of sugar whilst a box of raisins contains two (right)

Meanwhile, in Western Europe the average is 101g (20 teaspoons), Dr Francesco Branca, director of the WHO's Department of Nutrition for Health and Development, said.

In Europe, the energy intake from sugar ranges from around seven to eight per cent in Hungary and Norway to 16 to 17 per cent in countries like Spain and the UK.

'The two most common forms of unhealthy added sugars are table sugar (sucrose) and high-fructose corn syrup, a liquid sweetener made from maize.'

'Both are added to countless foods, turning up in everything from fizzy drinks to chicken korma,' Ms Dowden said. 

 

Jordans Frusli Bar, Bluberry - Two cubes

Along with the undisputed benefits of wholegrains, you get 2tsp of sugar. Some comes from the fruits and some is added to boost taste.

Volvic touch of fruit lemon and lime (1.5l) - 16.5 cubes

This flavoured water may look healthy, but the high sugar content makes it equivalent to sugary pop.

Tesco Chicken korma and pilau rice (550g) - Three cubes

Sweeter, creamier sauces contain added sugar, and often in quite high quantities.

Naked Juices Green Machine (150ml) - Half a cube

While the sugars in this green juice from fruits, one cube of sugar (53g) is a 150ml bottle is still a lot of is still a lot to consume. There’s more sugar here than there is in a regular bag of Skittles (46g)

Innocent Mangoes and Passion Fruits smoothie - Six cubes

Some of the fruit in smoothies is whole fruit that’s crushed, and so it still contains fibre. This isn’t as bad for you as pure juice, which counts as added sugar.

One tablespoon ketchup - One cube

Sugar is added to ketchup to achieve that characteristic taste, though some comes from the tomatoes.

BBQ Pringles (190g) – One and a half cubes

The sugar turns up in the BBQ ‘ flavour’, which is largely sugar.

Apple – Two and a half cubes

Though apples contain a surprisingly high amount of sugar, it’s ‘good’ sugar, encased in fibre.

Muller Light Strawberry - Two and a half cubes

Many low-fat foods contain high amounts of sugar to compensate for the lack of taste and texture.

New Covent Garden Plum Tomato and Mascarpone Soup (600g) - Six cubes

Sugar is added to this soup, but much of it comes from the high concentration of tomatoes, which means it is classed as ‘good’ naturally occurring sugar.

Waitrose Love Life Crayfish & Mango Salad - Two cubes

A reminder to watch out for sugar in salads — this one has a Thai dressing packed with sugar, plus some less damaging sugar in the mango.

Sun-Maid Raisins – Two cubes

Not the unhealthier ‘bad’ sugar found in sweets, but it can quickly add up if you have anything more than the smallest serving.

Dolmio Bolognese Original Sauce (500g jar) Six and a half cubes

Most tomato pasta sauces contain added sugars to boost the taste, though some will also occur naturally in the tomatoes.

Tropicana Smooth Orange Juice (200ml) – Three and a half cubes

Though sugar in the whole fruit counts as ‘good’ sugar, juicing removes the fibre, so it is classified as the more harmful ‘added sugar’.

Semi skimmed milk (200ml) – Two cubes

Milk sugar doesn’t count as the harmful added kind because it is released slowly in the body.

 Bran Flakes (30g with milk, 125ml) - Two and a half cubes

Bran Flakes are 22 per cent sugar, but here milk adds half a cube.

One sugar cube equals one teaspoon of sugar.
