A jury yesterday found the owner of a nursery was to blame for safety failings that caused a three-year-old girl to die playing on a slide on her first day there.

York College faces an unlimited fine over the death of Lydia Bishop who was asphyxiated when her neck was caught in a looped rope attached to the slide as she played unsupervised.

Nursery worker Sophee Redhead, 25, who was helping to supervise Lydia shortly before the tragedy, burst into tears as she was cleared of all charges. Her barrister had told the jury that bosses ‘have hung Sophee out to dry’ and criticised senior managers for failing to give evidence at Leeds Crown Court.

manslaughter by gross negligence

The court heard parents were unaware 
there was an ‘attitude of neglect’ at the nursery where a ‘tick-box 
mentality’ among management meant safety rules were followed on paper 
but not in practice.

Miss 
Redhead was charged with manslaughter by gross negligence, but was 
cleared by a unanimous decision. She was also cleared of an alternative 
charge of failing to take ‘reasonable care’ of the little girl.

York
 College – owner of the on-site nursery – will be sentenced next week 
for failing to ensure the health and safety of children.

Lydia
 died five hours into her first day at the nursery in September 2012.  
Her mother Rebecca Dick sobbed as the college of further and higher 
education where she had enrolled on a mechanics course was convicted.

Lydia Bishop was found blue and not breathing after she got her neck caught in a rope on a slide in the outdoor play area at York College's nursery, pictured, Leeds Crown Court heard

Police officers at the York College Nursery playground. Lydia's mother Rebecca Dick recalled her daughter's last words to her in a statement read out in court. The toddler told her mother: 'I love you mummy, see you later'

Lydia
 had asked her to bring sweets ‘for being good’ when she picked her up 
and her final words were: ‘I love you mummy, see you later.’ But Miss 
Dick, 24, never saw her alive again.

She
 and Lydia’s father, self-employed joiner Brad Bishop, 26, had dropped 
their daughter off at 9am. Around mid-afternoon Miss Dick was ushered 
out of class and taken to York Hospital by police where she found 
doctors trying in vain to revive Lydia.

A
 medical expert said the girl could have recovered had she been found 
within a few minutes of being choked, but there was a 20-minute delay 
before nursery staff found her.

CCTV
 showed children twice played unsupervised on the slide that day. There 
had been two accidents involving the rope weeks earlier.

Lydia
 had walked around a ‘futile’ makeshift barrier of a bench and toy 
trolley designed to stop children from going to the play area alone.

Miss Redhead was accused of seeing her walk towards the slide and doing nothing, but the jury decided she was not to blame.

York College - which operated the nursery for children of staff, students and members of the public - was found guilty of health and safety charges

The college will be sentenced by Judge Coulson next week. Miss Redhead was also found not guilty of a separate charge under health and safety legislation, for not taking 'reasonable care' of Lydia

The
 CCTV shows Lydia, dressed in white trousers, climbing the steps to the 
slide, before a slight movement is seen at the top of the slide.

Almost
 20 minutes later a member of staff realised Lydia was missing and asked
 Miss Redhead to check outside. She looked towards the slide and saw 
Lydia lying on it. CCTV shows her running over and then carrying the 
lifeless girl in her arms.

Sobbing,
 she told the court: ‘As I got closer I saw something on the slide, 
something white. I realised that she was on the slide.’ Miss Redhead 
untangled the rope from Lydia’s neck. ‘I pushed her and shouted her 
name,’ she said. Despite desperate efforts at CPR, Lydia never regained 
consciousness.

Prosecutor 
Robert Smith, QC, said there had been ‘systemic failure’ by staff and 
management at York  College to impose basic safety procedures. Rules 
forbade children playing on the slide unsupervised and the ropes were 
supposed to be put away. A risk assessment had identified the danger of 
strangulation.

York College said the nursery had been closed and would not reopen.

Chief
 Inspector Nigel Costello, of North Yorkshire Police, said the case 
should serve as a warning to organisations, adding: ‘Health and safety 
is more than just a tick-box exercise.’
