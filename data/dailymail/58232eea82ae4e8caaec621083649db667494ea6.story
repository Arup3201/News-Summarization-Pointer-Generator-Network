More than 100 City bankers will be handed £42million in unpaid bonuses after their employer lost a legal battle to block handouts of up to £1.6million each.

Court of Appeal judges said today Commerzbank was wrong to refuse to pay an average £400,000 per person  at the height of the financial crisis.

in 2009 Commerzbank had saved rival Dresdner Kleinwort from collapse after it lost billions of pounds and had to be bailed out by German taxpayers.

Lost: Germany's Commerzbank refused to pay 104 bankers their bonuses at the height of the financial crisis, but lost their Appeal Court case today

As part of the deal they took on Dresdner bankers in London and then refused to pay their 104 new staff the £42million bonus pot they had been promised by their ailing former employer.

Refusal: The bankers (file picture) were to receive up to £1.6m from their previous employer, which had to be bailed out

The legal battle over the cash has lasted four years, but High Court judges today found in favour of the bankers and said that the decision was a breach of contract by Commerzbank, and they must now pay the cash in full.

A panel comprising of Lord Justice Elias sitting with Lord Justice Maurice Kay, Vice President of the Court of Appeal, and Lord Justice Beatson said they rejected the bank's concerns case.

Their decision upheld a previous High Court ruling last May saying that the bankers were entitled to the cash

Commerzbank had argued that the judge had not treated their arguments objectively, and that it was artificial to treat the promised bonuses distinct from financial performance.

At a time of continuing political and public anger at fat cat bank bonuses the 104 bankers. had accused the bank of broken promises over their share of a guaranteed bonus pool announced by Dresdner Kleinworth in August 2008.

As well as being ordered to pay the bonuses Commerzbank have been left with a legal bill estimated at £5 million for a hearing lasting more than three weeks.

They will also face the costs of a three day appeal which could add another £500,000 to their legal bill.

Decision: Judges at the High Court found that it was a breach of contract not to pay the £42m promised

A Commerzbank spokesman said: 'Commerzbank is disappointed with this decision and is considering its legal options. It is a regrettable outcome in view of the on-going regulatory, public and shareholder calls to establish a sound relationship between banks' performance and variable remuneration.

'It remains the Bank's belief that as a matter of law, no binding contractual commitment was made, that bonus amounts communicated were provisional and that it was reasonable and rational to reduce the bonuses in the light of the 6.5bn euro loss that Dresdner's investment banking operation posted for 2008.

'In other jurisdictions, national courts upheld Commerzbank's position. In October 2011 the highest court in Germany, the Bundesarbeitsgericht, ruled in Commerzbank's favour on the same case for employees whose contracts fell under Germany employment law in the third and last instance.

'In Italy and Japan, the bank succeeded in having claims with the same facts dismissed. In New York arbitration proceedings earlier this year, the claims were rejected.'

'The individual claims range from 15,000 Euros to 2 million Euros, with the total claim amounting to 50 million Euros - £42 million.

'It was claimed the bonus pool was created to keep staff but they only received 10 per cent of what they were promised and launched the legal action to get the missing 90 per cent.

'But the Bank claimed that under a Material Adverse Change clause and because there was a deterioration in the bank's performance they were entitled to reduce bonus payouts.'
