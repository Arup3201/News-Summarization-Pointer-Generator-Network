Santa Barbara Sheriff's deputies checking on Elliot Rodger weeks before he killed six college students were aware of but didn't view disturbing videos that prompted calls about his well-being.

The sheriff's office says Thursday that four deputies, a police officer and a dispatcher in training were sent to Rodger's apartment April 30 after being informed by the county's mental health hotline that Rodger's therapist and mother were concerned about videos he posted online.

They questioned him for 10 minutes and then briefed Rodger's mother by telephone before having him speak to her directly.

It was revealed Thursday that police knew about Elliot Rodger's disturbing YouTube videos when they checked in on him last month, weeks before he went on a rampage

They found him shy, timid and polite. He told them he was having trouble fitting in socially in Isla Vista and the videos were a way to express himself.

He reposted some of the videos before Friday's rampage.

On Monday, 
sheriff's spokeswoman Kelly Hoover declined to discuss that visit in 
greater detail, pending an internal investigation, but said that 
deputies in general were barred from entering a residence without a 
warrant.

'An
 exception would be if deputies felt that a person was a harm to 
themselves or others or there was an immediate threat,' Hoover said.

'In this case, we would have had to determine that Elliot Rodger or his roommates were in immediate danger.'

Rodger wrote in his manifesto that he manipulated the officers to get them out of his hair.

'I
 tactfully told them that it was all a misunderstanding, and they 
finally left. If they had demanded to search my room… That would have 
ended everything,' he said in his manifesto.

Authorities
 say Rodger fatally stabbed three roommates in his apartment before 
shooting three students to death near the University of California at 
Santa Barbara. He then shot himself.

The
 two women and four men who were killed were aged 19 to 22 and students 
at the school. Thirteen people were wounded, including eight shot by 
Rodger as he sped through town in his black BMW, exchanging fire with 
police, authorities said.

'HE WAS JUST VERY QUIET'

Officers found Rodger dead in his car with three legally purchased pistols and more than 400 rounds of ammunition.

Chris
 Pollard, who lived in the same building as Rodger and knew him before 
the attacks, told Reuters in an interview that the videos that had 
concerned his mother should have been red flags for the sheriff's 
department. 

Sheriff Brown has ordered an internal investigation of how his deputies handled their interaction with Rodger

'When
 it got to the point that the parents called the police, it makes me 
wonder if the police even looked at the videos,' Pollard, 22, said. His suspicions turned out to be correct.

'If they'd looked at the videos, they could've done some sort of court order to do a search warrant.'

But
 the young man conceded that deputies would have needed legal grounds to
 search Rodger or his home and may not have found that justification 
during their visit to his apartment.

'When
 you looked at him, there was no reason to get concerned. He didn't seem
 like a threatening or intimidating guy. He was just very quiet,' 
Pollard said.

David
 Dusenbury, a former deputy chief of police in Long Beach, California, 
said the deputies could have obtained a warrant if the video explicitly 
threatened violence.

'If
 the caller said they feared he was going to harm somebody or himself 
based upon Internet postings, I would say the deputies did not go far 
enough in their investigation,' Dusenbury said.

He said that deputies could also have run Rodger through their system to learn he had guns registered in his name.
