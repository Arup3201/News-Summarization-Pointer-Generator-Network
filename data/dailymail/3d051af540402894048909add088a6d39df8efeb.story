Fears smokers opting for reduced-nicotine cigarettes would merely smoke more to get their hit are unfounded, say scientists.

Past studies have raised concerns that cigarettes with lower levels of nicotine could lead to people increasing the intensity of their habit to satisfy their cravings.

But a new study by a team at the University of Waterloo in Canada has suggested the fears may not have been realised.

Nicotine is the main addictive ingredient in cigarettes, giving smokers the highs they crave and the withdrawals that can blight an attempt to quit.

A new study by scientists at the University of Waterloo in Canada, found cigarettes with lower levels of nicotine do not prompt smokers to smoke more to achieve their fix

The researchers involved in the new study said past studies have raised 'concerns that reduced nicotine cigarettes will be smoked more intensely and, therefore, will increase exposure to toxic chemicals in smoke'.

Seventy-two adult smokers completed an unblinded trial of reduced nicotine cigarettes.

After filling out smoking history surveys, the participants spent seven days smoking their usual choice of cigarette.

That was followed by three consecutive weeks smoking different types of Quest, reduced nicotine level cigarettes.

Each week the levels of nicotine reduced, from 0.6mg in week two to week four when the participants smoked Quest 3 - with a nicotine emission of 0.05mg.

A regular cigarette has a nicotine emission level of around 1.2mg.

The scientists found that the smokers taking part did not change the number of cigarettes they smoked or the number of inhalations they took during each of the four weeks.

The study authors, said: 'The findings provide little evidence of compensatory smoking of Quest cigarettes - those with lower nicotine levels -, with no increases in exhaled breath carbon monoxide levels and smoking intensity.

A study of 72 adult smokers found 'little evidence of compensatory' smoking during a four-week experiment where smokers started with their usual brand, before smoking special low nicotine cigarettes for three weeks

'No significant differences were observed for smoking urges or measures of nicotine dependence.

'The study adds to the evidence that cigarettes with markedly reduced nicotine content are not associated with increased smoking intensity or exposure to smoke toxicants.'

David Hammond, one of the study's
 authors, mentions that the FDA now has a mandate 'to reduce nicotine 
levels in cigarettes to negligible amounts', Medical Today News reported.

He said: 'Our study suggests that smokers are unable or unwilling to compensate 
when there is markedly less nicotine in the cigarette and when the 
experience of smoking is far less rewarding.

'Our study may help 
regulators anticipate the possible consequences of mandatory nicotine 
reductions in cigarettes.'

The study was published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention.Â
