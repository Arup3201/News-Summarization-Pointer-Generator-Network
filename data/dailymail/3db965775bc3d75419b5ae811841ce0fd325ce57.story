A Cambridge University librarian has been left devastated after the Home Office labelled his marriage a ‘sham’ and forced his wife to remain in China.

David Rushmer, 48, met Wang Xiang online in June 2012. She was in Britain on a dependant visa with her ex-husband but that marriage fell apart six months after their arrival.

The 39-year-old Chinese national applied for a new visa and was told it would take up to three months to process - but was still waiting more than a year later.

Forced to live apart: David Rushmer, 48, met 39-year-old Chinese national Wang Xiang online in June 2012

During that time she met Mr Rushmer and five months later they decided to move in together. But in April last year they were left heartbroken when Miss Xiang’s visa application was refused.

Mr Rushmer decided to propose and they tied the knot two months later in China and prepared to move back to the UK as a married couple.

'Devastating': Mr Rushmer has launched a campaign to overturn the Home Office's decision after going six months without seeing his new wife

But their dreams were shattered when the Home Office blocked Miss Xiang’s move for a second time - allegedly saying they did not believe they were in love.

Mr Rushmer has launched a campaign to overturn their decision after going six months without seeing his new wife.

He said: ‘It's devastating. We are newlyweds and we are being treated like criminals. That is the bottom line. They are suggesting my wife has attached herself to me with the sole intention to gain a UK visa.

'The excessively harsh new UK spouse visa rules have recently torn thousands of families apart. The Home Office confirmed that we do meet these requirements, but we were stunned that after a four-month wait and an interview, my wife has had her visa refused.

‘They are saying the love we have shared over the past year or so is not genuine. Therefore we are liars, criminals, and so are my parents and all our friends who testified that we are very genuine, and so all our plans for our future happiness are on hold again.’

Mr Rushmer claimed Miss Xiang attended an interview in Beijing - 1,000 miles away from her home in China - where she was questioned about the relationship.

She also had to submit wedding photos, records of phone calls, bills and pictures of their engraved rings to Home Office officials.

The couple launched a petition which attracted almost 1,000 signatures in ten days as part of their appeal – but they have received no indication the decision will be overturned.

A Home Office spokesperson said: 'Each application to enter the UK is considered on its individual merits. Decisions are based on the evidence provided and made in accordance with the immigration rules.

'Permission to enter or remain in the UK on the basis of a relationship with a British citizen will only be granted if the Home Office is satisfied of an applicant’s credibility.'
