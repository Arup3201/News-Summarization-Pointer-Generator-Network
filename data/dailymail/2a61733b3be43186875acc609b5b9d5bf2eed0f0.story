Grief: Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard will honour her father in a private ceremony

There will be no formal funeral for the father of Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard, who died on Saturday.

Welsh-born John Gillard left his body to medical science in his final gift to mankind.

A funeral notice from Ms Gillard's office said instead his family and friends will mourn his death and celebrate his life at a private gathering.

And those wishing to honour his memory are being asked to give to his favourite charity, Medecins Sans Frontieres - Doctors Without Borders.

Mr Gillard, 83, who died on Saturday, used his humble background in South Wales as a catalyst to improve himself and those around him with a lifelong love of literature and education.

The funeral notice said: ‘John was a humble man who always sought to help others.

'He died as he lived and has donated his body to science and requested that there should be no formal funeral service.’

Another funeral notice, from the trade union United Voice, paid tribute to Mr Gillard as a life member who had a longstanding commitment to the union movement.

‘John upheld union values, and often talked of the impoverished conditions of vulnerable workers and the benefit of collective action through union membership. His life was spent improving the lives of others,’ it reads.

After the family emigrated to Australia find a warmer climate for young Julia's chronic chest infections, Mr Gillard trained as a psychiatric nurse and ended up working as a clinical nurse supervisor at Glenside Hospital.

‘We came to Adelaide as 10-pound Poms,’ Mr Gillard said in 2010, when Ms Gillard became Prime Minister.

‘It was my impoverished background - I had to leave school and start work at 14 - that helped shape Julia's passion for education, so the underprivileged can rise up the ladder of opportunity,’ he said at the time.
