If you've ever fancied owning a slice of some of the most beautiful countryside England has to offer, then now’s your chance.

A stunning mountain lake, a stretch of rocky shoreline and several sites of ancient woodland, home to red deer and red squirrels, are among eight sites being sold by the Lake District National Park Authority.

But the sale has provoked anger among locals who say it would have Lakeland poet William Wordsworth ‘turning in his grave’. 

The possible sale of beautiful countryside in the Lake District such as Blea Brows, an area of shoreline alongside Coniston Water on the market for £90,000, has angered locals

Stickle Tarn, a glacial lake popular with swimmers in Great Langdale, is up for sale with a guide price of £20,000 to £30,000

They are angry that they were not consulted about the decision to sell the picturesque sites – worth a total of up to £665,000 – and at the ‘sheer speed’ of the sale, which is being rushed through in five weeks.

Perhaps the most impressive site is Stickle Tarn, a ‘majestic’ 24-acre glacial lake in Great Langdale, high above Coniston Water and Windermere, which is popular with wild swimmers. It is up for sale with a guide price of £20,000 to £30,000.

Forty-one acres of woodland at Waterside Knott, near Newby Bridge, is being sold with a guide price of £130,000. The site has a 215-year-old Grade II listed viewing tower and is home to red squirrels, door mice, and roe and red deer.

Blea Brows, a stretch of shoreline along Coniston Water, is for sale with a guide price of £70,000 to £90,000. The ten-acre site has stunning views, a small beach and oak, birch and holly woodland.

The Lake District National Park Authority, the Government-funded body responsible for managing the park, insists strict covenants on the land ensure the sites will be protected for the public and rights of way will not be affected.

But some locals fear access could be restricted, woodland and historic dry stone walls may not be properly managed and that wealthy buyers may apply for planning permission to build on the land.

Heidi Halliday, a district councillor for Ambleside and Grasmere, said: ‘Wordsworth would be turning in his grave if he knew what was happening. Everyone is incredibly upset, especially because it has been handled so badly, with no consultation. Stickle Tarn is the only tarn left under the park authority’s ownership. You would think they would want to keep hold of it, not sell it to the highest bidder.’

Last week the House of Lords stepped in to urge the Government to halt the sale. All bids are due in by Thursday but local groups hoping to raise the cash for a community bid say they had no chance to secure enough money in five weeks. The park authority says it has lost £1.56million of Government funding over the past five years and has no option but to sell.

It says it has a duty to get value for money for the taxpayer and that a public body need not own the land to be a good custodian of it.

Chief executive Richard Leafe described the decision to sell the land as ‘good management’ in ‘the existing financial climate’.
