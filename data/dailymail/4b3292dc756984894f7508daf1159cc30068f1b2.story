A father of two who became a YouTube sensation by filming himself as he learnt to cook is giving Jamie Oliver a run for his money – after being announced as the new face of a Sainsbury's campaign.

Barry Lewis, from Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, didn't even know to poach an egg five years ago and started filming himself in his kitchen as he taught himself to cook with his daughter Phoebe, now six.

The 32-year-old, who has a degree in IT from Bath Spa University, has racked up nearly 10million views, 150,000 subscribers, a best-selling book called 'Dinner's On' and has featured on Jamie Oliver's Food Tube channel.

Now, the married father of two has been chosen to front Sainsbury's 'Love Your Freezer' campaign, which promotes cooking nutritious family meals straight from the freezer.

Barry Lewis, 32 (pictured), from Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, became a YouTube sensation after uploading videos of himself learning how to cook. He has now been revealed as the face of a new Sainsbury's campaign

The married father of two, who is a fan of Jamie Oliver (pictured together above), wants to follow in the famous chef's footsteps and quit his full-time job as a quantity surveyor to pursue his newfound career

Mr Lewis, who quit his full-time job as a quantity surveyor two years ago to concentrate on his new career, said: 'I never thought I'd ever make any money out of it.

'It just snowballed from the first film. I uploaded poached egg on toast and it has gone mad ever since.

'Food has become more than just a hobby, so I spend most weekends cooking and coming up with recipes.

'It has become a passion to me and I am on an incredible journey.'

He said he had even started exercising due to the amount of food he is now cooking and eating. 

'I've had to start going to the gym because I'll end up putting on weight because of cooking from home,' he said.

Mr Lewis used to rely on takeaways but was inspired to learn to cook after watching Jamie Oliver poach an egg during a Christmas special.

His first video 'poached egg on toast' was posted on YouTube in January 2010 and was soon followed by 'ratatouille'.

Since then he has posted more than 700 videos which have attracted 9.6 million views and he now has his own website www.myvirginkitchen.com.

Many of the videos feature him cooking with daughter Phoebe in the kitchen of the family's  £150,000 home in Weston-super-Mare, and they often wear fancy dress as they lark around in front of the camera.

He has attracted nearly 10million views and 150,000 subscribers with his regular cookery videos on YouTube

His other daughter Chloe, two, has also appeared, although his camera-shy partner Rebecca has never voluntarily featured in the videos.

He said: 'Sometimes I get a bit of help from Phoebe as she likes to join in.

'But you'll never see much of Becky. She's like a Tom and Jerry character in my videos - you will just see a bit of an arm or a leg as she gets out of the way of the camera.'

Mr Lewis also performs daft cooking stunts with titles such as 'Cooking in My Pants' and 'Builder's Cake', where he uses a cement mixer in his kitchen.

He said it wasn't his parents - his father Steve is a postman and his mother Anne, a school nurse assistant - who inspired him to take up cooking, but instead his idol Jamie Oliver.

He never had an interest in food growing up, when he attended Priory Community School - an academy trust in the Worle area of his hometown.  

Instead, he spent four summers working as a lifeguard in the U.S. as part of Camp America in his 20s, before returning to the UK to work at Halifax bank for seven years. 

He became a quantity surveyor in September 2008 but quit two years ago after sending a clip of one of his recipes to Jamie Oliver.

As a result of sending the video, Mr Lewis became a regular contributor to the star's Food Tube channel and said he quit his job as a quantity surveyor - which involved a daily commute to Newport, south Wales - to concentrate on his cookery career.

He has since appeared on The Apprentice, This Morning and The Gadget Show. 

All of his videos are still filmed in his kitchen but his success has allowed him to splash out on essential equipment such as a tripod.

He said: 'At the start I was getting ideas from food websites, but I soon started to get a bit more creative and a lot of the recipes these days tend to be more of my original ideas.

'I've got a tripod now for the camera. I was balancing it on some biscuit tins before.

'It's very much real cooking in a real kitchen.

Mr Lewis sent a clip of one of his recipes to his idol Jamie Oliver and became a regular contributor to the star's Food Tube channel two years ago. He has since seen his popularity rise and received millions of views

'There are no food stylists, and instead of a live audience of about 100 people, as there was for the launch of Food Tube, it's usually just me on my own.' 

Mr Lewis now wants to inspire other 'kitchen virgins' to try out new recipes.

'I want to inspire other people to cook instead of feeling intimidated about giving it a try,' he said. 'My philosophy is that if I can do it, then anyone can.

'Everything you see me cook I am cooking for the first time - it is all about trying to inspire people who have never cooked to give it a go.

'I have done more than 700 videos to date, mainly recipes ranging from simple one-pot dishes, quick dinner ideas to cooking with kids or naughty desserts.

'I like to have fun, too, and often taste things people have been sending me or try and overcome food fears. Basically, anything goes.'

'What is nice is the way My Virgin Kitchen has become a real community. I really enjoy the reaction I get from people who follow me.

'My phone doesn't stop vibrating these days, as I'm always getting messages on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.'

Mr Lewis is a big fan of the frozen food he is seen preparing in his Sainsbury's TV ads, which aired on screen last Friday. 

'The freezer is great for storing meals ahead of time,' he said.

'If you can get into the habit of batch cooking at the weekend and storing in the freezer for a quick week night fix, you'll save having to cook from scratch and still get a great meal.' 

The 'Love Your Freezer' campaign will run on TV and online until mid-February.
