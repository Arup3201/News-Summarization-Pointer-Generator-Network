A Democratic Congressman annoyed with House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Darrell Issa trolled his Republican colleague today with a sarcastic suggestion he build a 'truth pond' in the hearing room to more effectively ferret out witches.

'It is clearly obvious that witches can only be found by dunking them in water,' Rep. Tony Cardenas said in a press release announcing his request.

'If they float they’re a witch. If they don’t, installing a pool will allow us to retrieve the non-witch before he or she drowns.'

Cardenas made the recommendation after Issa and other Republicans on Oversight voted this morning to rebuke a White House official for refusing to comply a subpoena to appear before the committee.

Rep. Tony Cardenas, pictured here are an Oversight committee last year, mocked committee chairman Darrell Issa today for engaging in what Democrats are characterizing as a partisan witch hunt

Issa has been trying to get the aide - White House Director of the Office of Political Strategy & Outreach David Simas - to talk to committee members under oath so they can probe him about the work he does for the president.

Republicans on the committee are concerned that Simas may be breaking a federal law called the Hatch Act by engaging in political activity in his official capacity as a presidential adviser.

At the advice of White House Counsel  W. Neil Eggleston, Simas is declining to testify. Eggleston assets that high-ranking White House aides have 'absolute immunity' and cannot be made to appear before Congress.

Issa
 said today that it's imperative that Simas give on-the-record 
statements about his role at the White House so 'committee members and 
the American people an opportunity to hear from 
the head of an office that has, under several previous administrations, 
misused public resources for political purposes.'

'We have an absolute right and obligation' to investigate this matter, the California congressman claimed, arguing that the subpoena is 'consistent with our requirement to do oversight even without a predicate of wrongdoing.'

'This is not alleging a scandal at any level,' Issa said in remarks during the committee hearing, as reported by Roll Call. 'We are accusing neither the president nor this four-person office of
 any wrongdoing.'

Issa's rejection of Democrats' request that he end his quest to interview Simas under oath widened a riff between the Republican Congressman and his colleagues across the aisle.

Democrats say Issa, a Republican, is wrong to haul individuals before the committee whom he doesn't know to have committed wrongdoing

In his press release mocking Issa today, Cardenas recommended the above ground pool be named the 'Senator Joseph R. McCarthy Memorial Truth Pond' in honor of a Republican lawmaker who gained notoriety in the 1950s with claims that Communism was afoot at the highest levels of government.

He also called for a plaque to be installed next to it with a quote from former head counsel for the United States Army, Joseph N. Welch, who once said to McCarthy, 'Have you no sense of decency, sir? At long last, have 
you left no sense of decency?'

In extra snarky bit at the end, the press release said 'the pool will be available for 
staff and member recreation when committee “hearings” are not being 
held.'

'Like the Chairman, I am interested in effective government oversight and
 reform,' Cardenas said. 'This pool will allow that to take place, wasting far fewer 
taxpayer dollars in the process.'

The recommendation is in response to a party-line vote this morning to rebuke a 
White House official for refusing to comply a subpoena

The White House says the official is 'absolutely immune' from congressional subpoenas, but Issa won't take no for an answer
