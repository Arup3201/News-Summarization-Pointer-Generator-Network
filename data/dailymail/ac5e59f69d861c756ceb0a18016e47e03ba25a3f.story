'TV star': White Dee is taking her children on holiday for the rest of the week after being signed up by an agent dubbed the 'Brummie Simon Cowell'

Benefits Street 'star' White Dee has been signed up by an agent and has been inundated with bra modelling and television offers - although she is still living off handouts.

The single mother-of-two says she is unable to work because she is 'depressed' - but that is not stopping her sizing up a string of lucrative offers.

Her new agent Barry Tomes - dubbed the 'Brummie Simon Cowell' - said: 'She has had loads of offers and can't quite get her head round the figures involved.

'But that's TV - she's got the x-factor, innit.

'She is TV gold and we will make her a lot of money.'

She is going on holiday for the rest of the week to somewhere within Britain with her two children Caitlin, 16, and Gerrard, seven, who are on their half term holiday.

Despite being signed off work sick, White Dee has made two live television appearances this week and also written an article for The Spectator magazine.

Tory MP Philip Davies yesterday branded the 42-year-old who lives off Â£200 a week in handouts 'bone idle' and said that jobless single mother has no interest in getting a job.

Speaking from her council house in James Turner Street, Birmingham, White Dee - whose real name is Deirdre Kelly - said the pressure of being a celebrity has made her more 'depressed'.

The unemployed mother said: 'It has been such a hectic time, it has been crazy. I have had offers from all over the world but I am still just Dee, mum to Gerrard and Caitlin.

'Someone has asked if I will be a rapper, I think that is the one I was shocked by the most.

'I
 think it came from a band in London. My street cred is going through 
the roof now. I will be rapping on an LP next. Don't get me wrong I rap 
at home.

'Me and the little fella make up raps - so bring it on. You will be watching me and Eminem battle it out for number one.

'I guess I have got the dilemma of being an MP or a rapper now - maybe even a rapping MP. I will be getting down with the kids.'

Her new agent Mr Tomes claims to have offices in Los Angeles and France - but was today seen getting into a battered old silver Ford Mondeo.

He said the media should just refer to White Dee as 'Dee' from now on - and said she would be coming off benefits shortly.

'The first thing to do is sort her benefits out. If I can get just one person off handouts that would be great,' he said.

Agent: Barry Tomes who today said that the Benefits Street star is 'TV gold and we will make her a lot of money'

'She says she can't work at the moment but she wants to. Dee is going away for a few days now with her children who are on half term - somewhere within the UK.

'Then we are going to discuss her offers with her. We have literally been inundated - every television show you can imagine wants her, there are perfume offers, clothing and bra companies.

'Universities want her to come and speak, she has had offers to do topless photo shoots and she can launch a music career.'

Michelle Mone's upmarket lingerie firm Ultimo denied claims they wanted White Dee to model for them.

Dee's agent Barry runs the Tomes 
Media Group which has run marketing campaigns for the likes of Gotham 
Records, Promobeats and Ripperstone Films.

He
 has been working in the music industry for nearly 40 years after he 
started out in the 1970s as a Tour Manager for 1960s star Lulu.

He
 then went on to run his own successful music agency representing 
British pop band Right Said Fred - who had a 1991 number one hit in the 
US with 'I'm Too Sexy'.

He also boats an impressive client list including Alvin Stardust, Slade, Tony Christie and Shakin' Stevens.

White
 Dee said: 'Barry is my guardian angel. He came into my life on Monday 
when I was being harassed by the media, it went mental.

'He
 has just given me some breathing space because I have never dealt with 
it before and he is now a great friend. We speak every day.

'I guess for the future watch this space, I will just take each day as it comes.'

She added that she has become such a celebrity that she is unable to walk down the street without being harassed.

'I
 really have had my personal life invaded, I can't walk down the street 
or walk into a supermarket without people coming up to me,' she said.

Benefits Street 'star' White Dee has signed up for her own Twitter account - after becoming sick of people impersonating her.

Explaining her recent decision to set up her @therealdeekelly Twitter account, she said: 'I can just about send a text message but I have had to go on Twitter because I have got too many people pretending to be me, basically being horrible to me.

'I don't really personally care what people think of me - all I care about is that I am loved by my friends and by my family.

'Too many people are too quick to judge.'

The unemployed 42-year-old, who has also been mocked on fake Facebook accounts, joked: 'Why do they want to impersonate me for God's sake - I wouldn't want to impersonate myself!'

'I really can't believe it or get to grips with it. But if someone says I can't do it, it is like a red rag to a bull I want to prove I can do it and that I am not common.

'The thing with being an MP is I am an everyday person who knows what it is like so I think that would be good. I would focus on the children of today.

'All the attention has made my depression worse though because I can't plan ahead so I let people down. I can't cope with the pressure.

'The depression started when my mum died a couple of years ago. She had been ill for quite some time but we all thought she would live for ever.

'She seemed to deteriorate quickly. I just can't really talk about it to be honest.

'I just have to take each day as it comes. I think there is enough help out there for depression and grief but it needs advertising.

'So at the moment I need to be on benefits until I feel better and have got my head around everything. Nobody wants to be on benefits but I need to be.

Television appearance: White Dee has made TV appearances but says she was not paid

'I have had offers from all over, from being a topless model, a full time agony aunt to a rapper. Obviously some are ridiculous and some are more serious.

'But my kids come before any money, it is about their future. I guess all these offers could make millions.

'I am still doing my everyday life. I will never swan off and leave my kids.

'James Turner Street is my home and my family and I will never leave it, no matter about the attention.

'Obviously some days I have bad days and I don't feel well so with all the people coming to my door I have had to put a sign up saying I am ill and to respect my wishes.

Controversy: Critics have questioned whether White Dee is really unable to work. However, mental health charities have said that depression is not always obvious

'People are good though and they respect it.

'People come to the door - just normal people wanting to meet another normal person. They want photographs with me which I can't understand.

'They want my autograph as well but I will never do that, it is ridiculous. I guess the show could be my ticket off benefits but I am not up to full time work at the moment.

'I have never classed myself as a celebrity - I am who I am and I won't be changing.'

The Benefits Street single mother said she has had three marriage proposals since appearing on television.

She said: 'I have had three marriage proposals since the show. I want them to take me out for dinner first though.

'I have had boyfriends but never in the house. I don't think it is fair on the kids to have a boyfriend around.'
