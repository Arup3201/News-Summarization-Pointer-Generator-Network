On TV: Labour Peer Lord Falconer (pictured) appeared on BBC One to discuss plans for an assisted suicide law, but nobody represented the opposing view

The BBC has been accused of bias in its coverage of assisted suicide by a campaigner whose TV appearance was cancelled at the last minute.

A Christian doctor was due to oppose Labour peer Lord Falconer when he appeared on the BBC One Breakfast show to discuss his plans for an assisted dying law.

But he was then told that he was no longer needed, and Lord Falconer appeared on the programme alone.

Dr Peter Saunders, the campaigner director of anti-euthanasia group Care Not Killing, has complained to the Corporation after a planned appearance on the show to challenge Lord Falconer was called off.

The two had previously discussed the issue on the Today programme in 2012.

In a letter sent to BBC Director General Tony Hall, seen by The Sunday Telegraph, Dr Saunders said the Corporation had: 'consistently promoted an agenda seeking to change the law on assisted suicide and euthanasia'.

He added: 'The BBC has consistently acted as the 
cheerleader for legalising assisted suicide, a move that would lead to 
huge pressure on the terminally ill and disabled to end their lives.'

Dr Saunders has also claimed that the majority of medical opinion is against a change in the law to support assisted suicide.

The BBC has attracted numerous complaints in recent years over the prominence it has given to 'right to die' programmes - which are often very emotive.

A programme called Choosing to Die, presented to novelist and campaigner Sir Terry Pratchett, who has Alzheimer's disease, attracted 1,200 complaints when it was aired in 2011.

The programme followed a 71-year-old man who suffered from motor neurone disease, and showed the last moments of his life in a Dignitas assisted suicide clinic in Switzerland.

In 2010 a group of MPs said the Corporation 'misused public funds' and 'ignored the rights of the disabled' in a Commons motion which threatened to cut the BBC's public funding unless the issue was 'treated impartially'.

A BBC spokesperson said: 'Assisted suicide is an emotive subject which divides opinion.

'After much discussion within the editorial team it was felt that a single interview, in which Lord Falconer could be questioned fully on his views and proposals would be more suitable on this occasion.

'Our presenters strongly challenged his views and were careful to include the views of groups like 'Care not Killing' during the interview.'
