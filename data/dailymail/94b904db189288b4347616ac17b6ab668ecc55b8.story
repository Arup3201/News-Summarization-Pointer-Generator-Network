Rebels fighting against President Bashar al-Assad in Syria are suspected of sabotaging a batch of measles vaccinations - leading to the deaths of up to 50 young children.

Dozens of infants in the rebel-held cities of Jarjanaz and Sinjar in Idlib province died on Tuesday minutes after being given the drug.

Although the cause of death has not yet been established, officials reportedly suspect the vaccines may have been tampered with while left unguarded in a storage facility in Jarjanaz.

Dr Abdulla Ajaj - a physician who helped administer the vaccine - said the children all exhibited the same 'severe allergic shock' to varying degrees.

'There was shouting and screaming, it was hard for the parents. You get your child vaccinated and then you find your child dying, it's very hard,' Ajaj said.

There weren't enough respirators in the clinic, making the situation even worse, he added.

Video footage uploaded to social media showed a medic examining a young girl who was squirming.

Another child, in an orange tee-shirt and blue pants, appeared lifeless as a medic administered CPR.

He then opened the child's mouth to reveal a swollen, blue-tinged tongue.

Physicians for Human Rights, a New York-based group that works in rebel-held areas of northwest Syria, sent an internal e-mail saying that up to 50 children may have died from the vaccine.

The vaccinations are part of a large-scale campaign to stop the spread of measles, mumps, rubella and polio in rebel-held areas of northern Syria.

UN. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said UNICEF and the World Health Organization are 'deeply concerned'. 'Measles is a major threat to children in Syria and the campaigns are vital,' Haq added.

They are being distributed by volunteer medical and aid organisations operating in the area, according to the Boston Globe.

In a Skype interview with the paper, Dr Ajaj said the drugs had been delivered to the medical centre three days before being given to the children.

'This is the first time we have had such a problem,' he added.

Mr Ajaj proposed an alternative theory for the deaths - the vaccines were stored at too high a temperature.

'Most probably they were badly kept inside the fridges,' he said.

Samples of the leftover drug have now been sent to Turkey for analysis.

It is not yet known how long it will be before the results of the investigation are released.

Syria's conflict, now in its fourth year, has caused the collapse of its health system in contested areas, scattering medics, destroying clinics and making medicines and equipment difficult to obtain.

Nationwide vaccination efforts have been thrown into disarray and polio re-emerged in parts of Syria last year.

United Nations says that more than 190,000 people have been killed since the start of Syria's uprising against President Bashar Assad (pictured) in March 2011

The Western-backed opposition based in Turkey said it had suspended the second round of measles vaccinations, which began on Monday.

The campaign was meant to target 60,000 children.

In a statement, it said the vaccines used Tuesday met international standards and did not say what may have caused the deaths.

It is extremely unlikely that the vaccinations killed the children, said Beirut-based public health specialist Fouad Fouad, who said spoiled vaccinations were more or less harmless.

'It cannot cause death,' he said.

UN. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said UNICEF and the World Health Organization are 'deeply concerned' and awaiting further clarification.

'Measles is a major threat to children in Syria and the campaigns are vital... and especially important for children who've been away from their homes and communities and are living in camps or in other unsanitary conditions,' Haq said.

Opposition representatives could not immediately be reached for comment.

The United Nations says that more than 190,000 people have been killed since the start of Syria's uprising against President Bashar Assad in March 2011. 

The revolt began with peaceful protests but escalated into an insurgency and set off a civil war after government forces waged a brutal crackdown on dissent.
