A teenager's attempt to take his friend's attractive mother to the prom has been foiled by his school - after the boy's online campaign to make it happen swept across the internet.

Virginia high school student Anthony Pinnisi took to Twitter on Thursday night asking people to 'help a dude out' with a series of racy images of his friend's mother.

The senior at Patriot High School in the Virginia suburbs of Washington DC, had asked his friend Chloe Albright if he could take her mother to the prom if he got enough online support.

After his friend said 500,000 retweets would be required, and expressed her doubts that he could achieve this total, Pinnisi posted the conversation to Twitter with the images of Chloe's mother.

Challenge accepted: A Virginia teen recently started an online campaign to ask his friend's mom (left) out to prom 

Tweet: Pinnisi tweeted these images of his conversation with Chloe and photographs of her mother 

Looking for a date: Anthony Pinnisi (left) asked his friend Chloe (right) how many Twitter re-tweets he would need to take her mom out to prom and she said 500,000.  He amassed 80,000 in just a 24 hour period, before he was forced by his school to take the tweet down

But after 80,000 people retweeted his post, school officials stepped in and told him to stop his online campaign. 

His friend also seemed to be unimpressed at his antics - and the thoughts of her mother are unknown.   

Many Twitter users found Anthony's elaborate prom proposal hilarious, but others called him out for being inappropriate. 

Chloe, for one, didn't seem to find it too amusing.  

Criticism: Some called Anthony out for being inappropriate on Twitter, but many also found the campaign humorous 

Campaign over: Above, the tweet Anthony wrote after his school asked him to take the tweet down 

Prom date? Pictures of Chloe's mom that the young girl posted to her personal Twitter account 

Not funny: Chloe didn't seem to impressed by Anthony's online campaign, as evidenced by this tweet 

Mother and daughter: Chloe posted this picture of her and her mother on vacation to Twitter, shortly before Anthony's online campaign started
