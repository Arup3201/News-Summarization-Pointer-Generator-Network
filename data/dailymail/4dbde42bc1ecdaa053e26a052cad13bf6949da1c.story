Raheem Sterling was making headlines for all the wrong reasons for much of last week after complaining of tiredness on England duty, but the winger bounced back with a match-winning display for Liverpool against QPR on Sunday.

The 19-year-old was criticised for telling Three Lions boss Roy Hodgson he felt  tired so early in the season, and consequently only playing 27 minutes of his country's Euro 2016 qualifier against Estonia.

But the youngster answered his critics in style  as he shone for Liverpool at Loftus Road, and  he tweeted on Monday that, 'Every setback is a setup for a comeback. God wants to bring you out better than you were before.'

The midfielder was criticised for telling England boss Roy Hodgson that he was suffering from tiredness 

Sterling was put on the bench for England's clash with Estonia last week after saying he felt fatigued

As well as helping to create his team's opener with a quickly-taken free kick, Sterling forced Steven Caulker into an own goal with a dangerous pass across the box in the dying stages of the match.

Next up for Sterling and Liverpool is Wednesday's Champions League clash against Real Madrid, who are rumoured to be interested in signing the England international. 

Manager Brendan Rodgers will be hopeful the winger can continue his good club form against the Spanish giants, and put his recent bout of tiredness behind him.

Hodgson meanwhile was at the QPR game but did not speak to Rodgers after the match about the Sterling situation, and whether the midfielder is being overused.

Rodgers claimed there is no dispute between him and England's manager, and he told the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast show on talkSPORT: 'We have exchanged messages and there is no problem at all.

'We spoke a lot prior to the World Cup. There were various staff members with England that work for Liverpool and obviously we provide a number of players for them. The relationship was good and still is good.'
