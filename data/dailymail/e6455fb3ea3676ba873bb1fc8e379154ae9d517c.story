It was always too much to hope that the brief glimpses of sunshine would last.

And this week what little fine weather we’ve had is set to go out with a bang – and a flash.

Forecasters predict the heavens will open today, with thunderstorms, marble-sized hail and heavy rain battering  Scotland and the North of England.

Weather warnings are in place ahead of storms as the slow limp to a typical British summer continues.

While the rest of the week is expected to be fairly dry, even the 
hardiest of souls would struggle to sunbathe, with  temperatures set to 
dip to low double figures, cooler than the average for this time of 
year.

And any plans for a weekend barbecue could go out of the window as the weather may not pick up until June.

Forecaster Mark Seltzer said: ‘The weather is expected to return to 
normal by the beginning of June, so there is some optimism, but there 
are no heat waves on the horizon.’ He said to expect scattered rain in 
the South East today: ‘We could see some decent temperatures with 20C 
(68F) here and there, and light winds.

‘But there could be some thunder storms in eastern Scotland and northern England, and there are yellow warnings in place. Marble-sized hail is possible, and  lightning strikes.’

For the rest of the week, he said: ‘The general picture is for a 
cooling, with milder temperatures – colder than  average but not hugely.

‘There will be some cloud around and some light rain, but nothing too heavy and there will be sunny spells.

‘On Thursday and Friday we could see some gusty winds in the East, so it could feel quite chilly.

“Temperatures will be in the low double figures, but the weather will be changeable rather than unsettled.’

Mr Seltzer added that it was too early to say if it was likely to warm 
up soon, but added the beginning of June was looking more promising.

He said: ‘There’s not too much summer on the horizon, although it’s not 
overly bad. On our extended weather forecasts we have got some signals 
that there might be more in the way of dry weather to come.’
