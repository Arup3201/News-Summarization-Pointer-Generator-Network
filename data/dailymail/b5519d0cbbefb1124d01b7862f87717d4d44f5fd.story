'B******s': Hamish Ogston, founder of CPP, has criticised the FCA's £1.3billion compensation plan

A businessman who amassed a £100million fortune through a mis-selling racket showed  contempt for his seven million victims yesterday.

Hamish Ogston – who owns a multi-million-pound home next to Harrods and has been honoured by the Palace for ‘services to business’ – is at the centre of a scandal expected to lead to a flood of compensation claims.

With the help of Britain’s disgraced banking giants, his company misled customers into buying worthless insurance for their credit, debit or store cards.

But last night, Mr Ogston, who was awarded a CBE by Princess Anne in 2011, was unrepentant.

Asked about the estimated £1.3billion compensation payout, he described it as ‘b*******’ and a ‘ridiculous figure’ – and accused the Financial Conduct Authority of ‘sensationalism’.

The regulator said unwitting customers paid up to £84 a year for credit card insurance – even though they would never need it because they were receiving free cover from their bank.

It condemned Mr Ogston’s company CPP – which he started with just £1,000 capital in 1980 – for its central role in the huge mis-selling scandal which will lead to compensation payouts of £1.3billion.

And with breathtaking insensitivity for his victims’ plight, Mr Ogston remarked that the furore had made him look ‘a bit of a chump’.

Following the near collapse of CPP, the banks – including the publicly owned Royal Bank of Scotland and Bank of Scotland, now part of Lloyds Banking Group – have been left to pick up the vast majority of the compensation bill.

Fraud: 13 banks have agreed to pay out billions to customers who were wrongly sold credit card insurance

The embattled business founded by Mr 
Ogston, a former member of the Norwegian Merchant Navy, will contribute a
 paltry sum of £29million to the pot.

But Mr Ogston – who enjoys a 
luxurious lifestyle and owns several multi-million pound properties – 
will face no action over the scandal from which he has amassed his 
£100million fortune.

Experts last night condemned the ‘scandalous’ 
behaviour of the banks, who heartlessly ‘introduced’ their customers to 
CPP – and got paid vast sums in commission from CPP for the referrals.

Gillian
 Guy, chief executive at Citizens Advice, said: ‘Yet again banks have 
shown a complete disregard for their customers by selling them products 
they did not need.

'It is a scandalous business model to make money by 
misleading customers.’

The scandal involves 13 financial giants, 
including Britain’s big banks, such as Barclays, HSBC, RBS, Santander 
and Lloyds, as well as the country’s biggest building society Nationwide
 and credit card firms such as Capital One and MBNA.

The net spreads 
even wider to include M&S, one of the high-street’s best-loved 
chains. Its bank is wholly owned by HSBC.

About 23million useless 
policies were sold, or renewed, between January 2005 and March 2011, 
described by the City regulator as ‘widespread mis-selling’.

Typically,
 a bank customer would get a new credit card, and a sticker on the card 
would tell them to call CPP to activate the card, or to report that it 
had arrived safely.

Honour: Mr Ogston is pictured being invested with the CBE by Princess Anne in 2011

Hamish Ogston founded Card Protection Plan in London in 1980 in order to provide insurance to credit card users who were concerned about the risk of fraud.

He developed his entrepreneurial streak when he joined the Norwegian Merchant Navy aged 17 and sailed around the world, working on building sites and uranium mines in Canada.

After attending Manchester University, where he made a name for himself by dealing in cocoa futures, he decided to start his own business rather than look for a job so he could avoid sky-high income tax rates levied by the Labour government.

Although CPP took nearly a decade to turn a profit, it became enormously successful after he teamed up with more than a dozen banks to offer its services to all their cardholders - many of whom did not know what they were signing up for.

In an interview in 2000, Mr Ogston described the firm as ‘my best investment’ - and 10 years later, CPP, now based in York, netted him £120million when it floated on the stock market.

In 2011, he was awarded the CBE for services to business, receiving the honour from the Princess Royal in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace.

He retained a 57 per cent stake in CPP, but the firm’s fortunes turned sour last year when the FSA imposed a fine for the widespread mis-selling of card protection.

Mr Ogston, a father of three in his mid 60s, launched a bid to buy the company, but after he offered just £1.7million the offer was turned down, and he resigned from the board.

When they phoned CPP, aggressive salesmen would 
coerce the customers into buying the useless insurance policies in 
tactics described by the regulator as ‘overly persistent’.

Salesmen 
were given targets ‘for successfully dissuading customers who contacted 
CPP to cancel their policies’, the regulator said.

One former 
salesman, who did not want to be named, said he left after just one week
 in the job after being disgusted by the sales tactics.

Speaking to the 
Mail, he said: ‘It was the most awful, pressurised environment I’ve ever
 worked in. Absolutely horrid place. I’m not even slightly surprised 
their products are utterly useless.’

While customers were told they 
would benefit from up to £100,000 of insurance cover if their card was 
defrauded, they were not told they were covered by their bank for free.

On average, customers paid £35 a year for a card protection policy.

In reality, the FCA said the insurance actually cost 60p.

As
 a result, CPP scooped £34.40 from the sale – and paid up to 60 per cent
 of the money to the bank as a thank-you for the referral of the 
customer.

An identity protection policy typically cost £84 a year, but 
the insurance actually cost only £16. Again, CPP got £68 and gave as 
much as 50 per cent to the bank.

Simon Chouffot, from the Robin Hood 
Tax campaign, which wants new financial sector taxes to help tackle 
poverty, said: ‘The never-ending stream of dodgy dealings by banks puts 
your average scam artist to shame. It shows they will try any trick to 
fleece the public.’

All victims will be paid compensation, equal to 
an average of £185 each if the bill reaches £1.3billion and is shared 
equally between the seven million victims.

Despite his pivotal role in 
the scandal, Mr Ogston is one of Britain’s richest men, after pocketing 
£120million from selling a large chunk of shares when CPP floated on the
 stock market in 2010.

Widespread: As many as 14 banks are said to have been involved in the insurance scam

Controversy: The scandal centres around banks' links with the finance company CPP

He still controls 57 per cent of the business,
 although the share price has imploded.

Mr Ogston continues to enjoy the
 trappings of wealth, with several properties, including a £4.5 million 
mansion in Oxfordshire and an imposing townhouse in London’s 
Knightsbridge.

Justin Modray, founder of consumer finance website 
CandidMoney.com, said it is ‘thoroughly depressing’ to see another case 
of banks ripping off their customers.

He added: ‘By asking loyal 
customers to pay for policies that were essentially worthless, it is no 
wonder levels of trust in the high-street banks is at absolute rock 
bottom.’

Donna Ettridge said she is angry at the way she has been treated by M&S after paying for its Card Safe policy

Donna Ettridge took out a ‘Card Safe’ policy on her M&S credit card in 2001 – but discovered only yesterday that it has been a waste of money.

Mrs Ettridge, 54, said she was angry about how she had been treated by the high-street giant.

She is a regular shopper at M&S, has had an M&S credit card since 1986 and did not expect to be duped into buying insurance which was worthless.

But she was telephoned by a salesman in 2001 and coerced into taking out the policy, even though M&S Bank automatically offers the fraud protection for free.

The policy has cost Mrs Ettridge, from Hornchurch, Essex, a large sum of money, although she is not sure of the full amount. In April, she was charged another £53 for a further three years of ‘Card Safe’.

Mrs Ettridge, a widow, said: ‘It makes me feel quite angry that I’ve paid out for something that I did not need every three years for the last 12 years.’
