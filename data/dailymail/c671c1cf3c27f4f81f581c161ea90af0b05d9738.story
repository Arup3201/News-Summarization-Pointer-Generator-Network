Each week Sportsmail gathers up the ratings from our team of reporters to provide the best Premier League starting XI of the day.

Saturday's six fixtures brought plenty of excitement, including Arsenal's return to winning form with a 3-0 win at Aston Villa, West Ham's 3-1 win over Liverpool and Newcastle's comeback from two goals down at home to Hull.

GK - Vito Mannone (SUNDERLAND vs Burnley) - 7

Mannone was in top form as Sunderland earned a point at Turf Moor. He managed to keep Lukas Jutkiewicz at bay after the striker had proved a real handful for the Sunderland back line.

The Dutchman was a constant threat down the right flank as Newcastle surged back from two goals down to earn a point at home to Hull and alleviate some of the pressure on boss Alan Pardew.

MID - Mesut Ozil (ARSENAL vs Aston Villa) - 8

A brilliant return to form for the German, who was played through the middle rather than out on the left. Scored and set up another in his best performance for some time.
