A bereaved mother has been awarded about $638,000 after she sued a man for having an alleged sadomasochistic sexual relationship with her severally handicapped adult daughter.

Mary Kortner, of Greenwich, filed a civil sexual battery and assault lawsuit in 2006 against Craig Martise, a married father-of-four from the same town, saying her daughter wasn't able to consent to an abusive sexual relationship with him in 2003 because of her mental condition.

She first found out about the affair when she noticed red marks and welts on her daughter's neck.

Drawnout case: A jury has awarded about $638,000 to a woman who sued a man for allegedly having a sadomasochistic sexual relationship with her handicapped adult daughter

According to court documents, the relationship included Martise dragging Kortner by a leash and dog collar, slapping her with his hand and a belt, pinching and twisting body parts, tying and gagging her and dripping burning hot wax on her. 

Martise said Caroline Kendall Kortner, whom he met online, was able to consent.

Prosecutors refused to charge him, but Mary Kortner sued in 2006. 

She claimed that a court had ruled Kendall Kortner incapable of making decisions for herself and that she could not consent to any sex - much less the kind of relationship she had with Martise. 

A jury found in his favor in 2009, but the state Supreme Court overturned the verdict this June.

The latest trial resulted in a new Stamford Superior Court jury finding in favor of Mary Kortner on Thursday.

Kortner's daughter, known as Kendall, died in 2010 at age 39 from an undisclosed illness. 

She was diagnosed with clinical depression, borderline personality disorder, bulimia and anorexia, and she twice tried to commit suicide, according to court documents. 

She also in 2001 had a stroke that left her partially paralyzed from the waist down.

Commenting on Thursday's outcome, Kortner's lawyer, Christopher Burdett, said: 'We finally got justice for Kendall and obviously for her mother.

'This case is important because it sends a message ... to men who prey on women.

'People who do the kinds of things Martise did have to be made to answer to it, and the community needs to express outrage.'

Martise didn't return a phone message Tuesday. 

His lawyer, Philip Russell, said he plans to ask the trial judge to overturn the verdict or lower the award and then, based on the judge's rulings, consider appealing the verdict to a higher state court.

'We were somewhat puzzled and disappointed by the outcome,' Russell said. 

'Craig's a great guy. Unfortunately, like many things that become media sensations, he'll be pilloried before his side gets told.'

A probate court ruled in 1994 that Kendall Kortner couldn't manage her own affairs and appointed her mother as her conservator.

In Mary Kortner's appeal of the first jury verdict, the state Supreme Court ruled that people don't necessarily give up their ability to consent to sex, including sadomasochistic encounters, when they are placed under the legal conservatorship of others.

The court also said it is up to juries to decide if people are able to consent to sex.

While sadomasochism was glamorized in the popular book trilogy Fifty Shades of Grey, the practice has long been on questionable legal ground. 

Some lawyers believe people can't consent to being assaulted or abused under common law, while others say established legal principles provide sexual rights to most people, including the elderly in nursing homes and the mentally ill.

The Supreme Court ordered a new trial because a letter Kendall Kortner purportedly wrote in 2003 about unwanted sexual advances by another man was mistakenly given to the jury for deliberations despite not having been properly admitted into evidence.

Lawyers in the case had said they couldn't recall any legal precedents in the country on whether mentally ill people can consent to sex or sadomasochism.
