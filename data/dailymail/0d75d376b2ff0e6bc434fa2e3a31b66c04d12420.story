Guilty: Nathaniel Flynn is facing life in jail after admitting murdering his 84-year-old grandmother and trying to kill a nine-year-old boy

A man is facing life in jail after admitting murdering his 84-year-old grandmother and trying to kill a nine-year-old boy.

Nathaniel Flynn, 26, stabbed to death retired headmistress Louisa Denby at their shared home in Shipley, West Yorkshire.

He then tried to kill the schoolboy - who cannot be named for legal reasons - as he played at a local skate park.

Today, police said they had no idea what drove Flynn to commit the 'brutal and frenzied' attacks.

Julian Briggs, from CPS Yorkshire and 
Humberside’s Complex Casework Unit, said: 'This defendant is responsible
for two vicious and unprovoked attacks.

'It has not been possible to establish what drove Flynn to commit these awful crimes.

'He
has now admitted his responsibility and pleaded guilty to charges of 
murder and attempted murder.

'We hope this brings some measure of comfort
to the families of both victims.'

Flynn,
from Shipley, was due to go on trial next week, but admitted the 
charges at Bradford Crown Court this 
afternoon.

Flanked by four prison officers in the dock, he wore a 
blue shirt and jeans and was joined by members of his family.

He showed no emotion as he confessed to murdering his grandmother, before stabbing the terrified schoolboy who had been playing nearby.

Speaking after the hearing, Detective Chief Inspector Nick Wallen, of West Yorkshire Police, 
said: 'Louisa Denby was subjected to a brutal and frenzied attack at the
hands of her grandson Nathanial Flynn.

'To this day we still have no idea why he attacked her.

'Louisa was a lady, adored by her family, who had only ever shown her grandson love and kindness.

'Having murdered his grandmother, Flynn then targetted and attacked a young boy as he played in a skateboard park.

Horrific: Today, police said they had no idea what drove Flynn to commit the violent attacks

'He was stabbed through the arm and it was only through sheer luck that he wasn’t murdered by Nathanial Flynn on that day.

'On
behalf of West Yorkshire Police I would like to pay tribute to the 
people of Shipley who assisted the police to quickly detain and arrest 
Nathanial Flynn.

'I would also like to thank all of those members of the local community who provided the police with witness statements.'

Case: The 26-year-old is due to be sentenced at Bradford Crown Court, pictured, on December 18

Flynn also faced two other charges, which will remain on file, the court heard.

It is believed his mother, who lives in America, will fly over to the UK to attend his sentencing on December 18.

The schoolboy's father is also expected to be present. 

Addressing Flynn today, Mr Justice Keith said: 'There is only one sentence I can pass and that is a sentence of life imprisonment.'
