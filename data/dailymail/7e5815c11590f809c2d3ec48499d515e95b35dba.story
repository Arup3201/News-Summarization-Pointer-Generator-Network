Kimberley Lindfield, pictured, a former youth volunteer for St John Ambulance, told family and friends she was being verbally abused and felt 'intimidated' by people living next door

A 27-year-old woman who was honoured by Princess Anne for her dedication to charity work was found hanged after complaining she was being intimidated by noisy neighbours, an inquest heard.

Kimberley Lindfield, a former youth volunteer for St John Ambulance, was branded a 'grass' by neighbours after she reported their constant loud music to the housing association.

She told friends and family that she was left feeling 'scared' and 'stressed' after being verbally abused and had requested a burglar alarm be installed in her flat, it was heard.

Miss Lindfield, who battled depression and bulimia for 12 years, was found hanged in Wythenshawe Hospital, Manchester, in July 2012 - just hours after she was admitted following a suspected overdose. She died six days later.

The inquest at Manchester Coroner's Court heard that Miss Lindfield had said her neighbours would turn their music up 'really loud just to scare her' while another couple would shout at her. 

The charity worker, described as 'beautiful' and 'intelligent' by her family, was branded a 'grass' when she informed the housing association about the noise. 

Staff at the hospital said Miss Lindfield complained that was 'sick of her neighbours annoying her' shortly before her death.

Her friend, Ashley-Ann Vowden, told the inquest: 'She always felt they were trying to intimidate her. 

'On one occasion I was talking to Kim on the phone and I could hear a female voice. She was shouting at Kim calling her a grass due to the housing association having been called in due to the noise.

'Kim loved her flat. She was very proud of it and how it looked. She wanted to stay in her flat but at the same time she thought if she moved it would be easier.' 

Miss Lindfield had previously enrolled at Manchester Metropolitan University to study Applied Community Studies but suffered a break down due to the stress of studying and being away from her home in Cheshire.

She returned to Manchester and was moved into the rented flat in Wythenshawe after  receiving counselling from a mental health charity for her issues.

Her mother, Kerry Bentley, told the inquest that her daughter's problems started off as being noise related, but escalated into aggression. 

She said: 'I once advised her to go to housing which she did. She can be very capable. I offered to come with her but she said she'd sort it out. 

'She did put in a complaint and they sorted out the initial problem.

'What she didn't tell them was that the neighbours started to become aggressive toward her. When I asked her about it a week or so before her last admission to hospital I knew it was bothering her. 

The inquest heard that Miss Lindfield, pictured, had said her neighbours would turn their music up really loud 'just to scare her' while another couple would shout at her. She was branded a 'grass' when she complained

'Without me knowing she had applied for an alarm in the flat. She had started to get worried about someone breaking in. I hadn't realised. When asked about it she just said she ignored them.'  

Miss Lindfield received support from mental health charity 42nd Street, which works with young people aged 13-25, but was referred to other programmes when she turned 25.

She was involved in a number of projects to help train social work students to handle young people with mental health issues and spoke at conferences on the topic. 

Ms Bentley, a teacher, told the inquest that she feared her daughter had not received enough support when she was referred elsewhere once her counselling with 42nd Street ended.

She added that her daughter had admitted to her that she was also bulimic. 

She said: 'I would speak to her every couple of days. Sometimes she would not answer because she was feeling low or couldn't be bothered.

'We had agreed because I would worry myself that she would text back "ok" and she would say something like "I'm fine but I don't want to talk. We used to see her quite regularly. I would visit her and she would come to our house for Sunday tea'. 

Described by her family as 'a beautiful, funny, intelligent, creative and caring young woman', Miss Lindfield had won a string of awards for dedicated voluntary work. 

Her commitment to St John's Ambulance was recognised with the Grand Prior Award, which was given to her by Princess Anne at Buckingham Palace.  

The volunteer also received the Princess Diana Memorial Award, which is given to young people who unselfishly inspire and improve the lives of others in their communities.

In a statement posted online, Joanna Shaw, Youth Support Worker and Tess Gregson, Senior Youth Worker at 42nd Street, paid tribute to the 'inspiring' and 'loyal' young woman. 

They said: Kim will be remembered for her honesty, her ability to fight for what she and others believed in, the sheer loyalty and dedication Kim gave to the organisation and young people who came to 42nd Street. It is a privilege to have been part of Kim’s life.' 

Ms Bentley said: 'She was a very clever woman. She was very capable. She stood up to speak at conferences about issues of mental health.

She added: 'We felt very frustrated for Kim and Kim being kept out of the loop in regards what medication and what her diagnosis was. I do not think there was ever a formal diagnosis. When I asked Kim I don't think she was sure herself.'

'I just wish there was more support out there. We don't know what to do. I tried to talk to Kim about her mental health and she would get upset. Given the fact I did not want to upset her more, I would back off.'

Miss Lindfield was admitted to Wythenshawe Hospital on July 17 2012 with a suspected overdose of medication and later told a care support worker worker she was feeling down and 'stressed' about her neighbours. She died on July 23.

Michelle O'Donnell , Care Support Worker at Wythenshawe said: 'She said she was fed up. She was sick of her neighbours annoying her. She had trouble with her neighbours. She was fed up. She couldn't be bothered anymore. She wanted to do it again and she said she would do it again when she got home.' 

Since her death, her family and friends have set up the Kim Linfield Trust to raise money for 42nd Street, which has had its funding cut. It has raised more £7,000 so far.

The inquest continues.
