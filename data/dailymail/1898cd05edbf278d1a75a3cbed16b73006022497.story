A 25-year-old Mini has gone up for sale with just 13 miles on the clock, after it was originally bought for the previous owner's sons who were too tall to fit inside.

The car was one of 3,000 limited edition vehicles made at Longbridge, Birmingham, to mark the 30th anniversary of Mini production in 1989.

It was one of two bought by a Cheshire-based farmer who wanted to keep the vehicles to present to his sons when they turned 21.

The car was originally bought for the previous owner's sons for when they turned 21 - but they were too tall to fit inside by the time they came of age

His sons were however too tall to fit inside the cars by the time they came of age.

The cars were eventually sold to the British Mini Club, which raffled one off three years ago.

The other however remained in storage and is now being sold for £18,000.

The car, which comes complete with an original handbook wrapped in its packaging, has not even been registered since the day it rolled off the assembly line back in 1989.

Mini Club leader David Hollis, from Amblecote, near Stourbridge, said: 'It's an amazing story.

The Mini Thiry Anniversary Edition was launched in 1989 to mark the 30th year of Mini production.

Two thirds of the 3,000 vehicles made were painted in cherry red, while the remaining 1,000 were in black.

The model includes a range of features including pearlescent paint, a Mini 30 crest on the badge on the bonnet along with a special Mini 30 design on the boot and flanks.

The car features a 998cc four cylinder engine, 4-speed gearbox and minilite alloys.

'Classic cars are going through the roof at the moment. We are looking for around £18,000 but it may be worth more.

'We are seeing Minis go for £20,000 or even £30,000.

'The price is constantly on the rise and we’re willing to wait to get the correct price for such an excellent car.

'Since 1989 it has only done 13 miles. I have driven it on and off a trailer but it has not even been registered.'

The final Mini to leave the factory in Longbridge was last year sold for £1,400 after being hidden for more than 30 years in tunnels.

Workers used the Mini Clubman 1275 GT to travel around the plant but it was dumped in the 1970s after being damaged when a storage container fell on it.
