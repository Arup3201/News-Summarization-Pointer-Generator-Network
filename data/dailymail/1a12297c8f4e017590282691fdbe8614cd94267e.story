Theo Walcott has been putting in some extra hours on the training pitch as the Arsenal winger looks to recover from the knee injury he suffered against Tottenham last season.

The 25-year-old has been out of action for for six months, but is targeting a return to Arsene Wenger's first team within the coming weeks.

Walcott took to Instagram to show off his sprinting skills on Wednesday afternoon as he went through his paces at Arsenal's London Colney training base.

The winger seems to be happy with his progress as he posted: 'Getting #Stronger & #Quicker every day!!!! #SpeedMatters'.

Gunners fans will be hoping Walcott can return to action sooner rather than later as Wenger looks to better his team's fourth-placed finish of last season.

The French boss has signed former Barcelona star Alexis Sanchez to bolster his attack and Walcott revealed recently his delight at the new boy.
