The PanicMe app can send red, amber or green alerts to let up to 30 contacts know you are in danger

Smartphone users can now set off a personal panic button to alert family and friends that they are in danger.

PanicMe fires off alerts of differing levels of importance to a chosen network of contacts if the user feels threatened or vulnerable.

The sender's location is then pinpointed using GPRS and potential responders can see how close they are so they can put a plan of action in place.

Offering a traffic light of options, a red alert tells contacts the sender is in imminent danger of being attacked or hurt, amber suggests you will need help soon, while green means you are in a low risk situation, such as being lost or breaking down.

The alerts can be sent to up to 30 contacts and can be accessed by police, who are able to login when notified at their control room.

Contacts are notified by pop-messages on their smartphones at regular intervals, with the space between the alerts depending on the panic button option. The alerts only stop once the alarm is deactivated by the sender.

The app, which launches this week, was developed by experts at DataMe, who worked alongside local police forces to come up with a program to help people feel safer in their daily lives.

Former Deputy Chief Constable David Lindley, who who acted as a consultant on the project, says: 'There may be any number of reasons and circumstances why people feel afraid or vulnerable.

'With so many people these days having a
 mobile phone, apps such as PanicMe cannot only help to make those in 
need feel much safer but can also give peace of mind to those who care 
for them.'

The alerts are delivered to your contacts' smartphones, using GPRS to pinpoint your location and showing them how close they are to you

Smartphone users can download a limited option of the PanicMe button for free, but it only offers a green panic alert. The complete version costs Â£14.99 and is available for the year on Apple, Android and Windows Smartphones.

The app's release comes months after a survey by Ipsos Mori and Kings College London found that two thirds of adults did not believe that crime rates were falling, suggesting the public is more wary than ever about their personal safety.

It's the latest smartphone add-on which can warn us of potentially dangerous situations - the recently unveiled MyWitness records video and audio to gather evidence during unexpected confrontations.
