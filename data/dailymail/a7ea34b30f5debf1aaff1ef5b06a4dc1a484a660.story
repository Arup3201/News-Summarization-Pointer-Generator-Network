Chris Smalling has told his Manchester United team-mates they must fight hard to ensure their unbeaten run stretches long into the new year.

Louis van Gaal endured a difficult start to life in England, but his United side are third in the table and are through to the fourth round of the FA Cup after an 11-match unbeaten run.

The last time United went on such a run was in Sir Alex Ferguson's final year in charge when the Red Devils went 18 matches without defeat.

Louis van Gaal's side are unbeaten in their last 11 matches - with their last defeat coming against Man City

Provided they beat fourth-place Southampton on Sunday, United's fixture list suggests they have a decent chance of stretching their current sequence to a similar length.

Van Gaal's team face QPR, Leicester, West Ham, Burnley, Swansea, Sunderland and Newcastle in the coming weeks, but Smalling knows there is still plenty of hard work ahead if United are to remain unbeaten and cement their position in the top four.

'Going into the New Year on the back of a good run means that it's a case of working even harder to climb the table and get as many points as we can,' the defender told United Uncovered.

'We need to do as much as possible on the pitch and, as an individual, do as much as we can in terms of recovery and extra work.'

After taking 13 points from his first 10 matches, Van Gaal was keen to emphasise that United's form would improve once the principles of his philosophy had sunk in with the players.

That philosophy has never been explained in public since Van Gaal moved to England, but whatever its components, it is clearly rubbing off on the squad.

'I think the key is to keep to the principles that the manager has set,' Smalling added

'The run shows that we've got a bit of consistency.

Louis van Gaal revealed on Friday that Ashley Young was Manchester United's only injured player

'I think we've really shown our team spirit in games where we've had to dig in or come from behind. It shows how well we all get on.

'We're all happy no matter what position we're in and we work for each other.

'If we can prolong our consistency and continue our hard work in training, things will click and we'll creep up the league.'

Van Gaal is likely to stick with his favoured 3-5-2 formation due to some encouraging news from the treatment room.

The Dutchman smiled broadly when he revealed only one player - Ashley Young - was unavailable for Sunday's game against his old adversary Ronald Koeman.

Luke Shaw has overcome an ankle injury and is fit to face his old club and Daley Blind is also in contention after a two-month knee injury layoff.

Rafael has trained this week despite fracturing his cheekbone against Yeovil, but Van Gaal is unlikely to take a gamble on the Brazilian as Antonio Valencia is back after a groin strain.

Luke Shaw and Rafael da Silva are both available to face Southampton on Sunday afternoon

'They [Shaw and Rafael] can play,' the United boss said.

'They are both not injured. Rafael Da Silva was of course operated on [his cheekbone], and maybe we don't take any risk with him, but Shaw can also play.'

Van Gaal is facing a dilemma regarding whether to play Angel di Maria, who was deemed fit enough only for a substitute appearance in the 2-0 FA Cup win over Yeovil.

'Angel di Maria has only played 20 minutes because of the match rhythm I gave him,' Van Gaal said of the Argentine, who missed three matches over the festive period because of a hamstring injury.

'I have said I only have one injured player but I don't have 100 per cent match-fit players.

'I have to select the best team and watch the qualities of Southampton.'
