West Coast Eagles midfielder Elliot Yeo is facing a lifetime of trips to the dentist and an estimated £40,000 dental bill after his two front teeth were knocked out in a sickening collision on Saturday.

The 20-year-old's front teeth were snapped off in the brutal blow during Saturday's clash against Collingwood at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

Footage from the moment Yeo's mouth came into contact with Collingwood ruckman Jarrod Witts' shoulder shows two white objects flying into the air as he is knocked to the ground.

Major blow: Elliot Yeo ost two teeth after a collision with Collingwood ruckman Jarrod Witts in the AFL

The funny side: Yeo continued  and tweeted afterwards: 'All I want for Christmas is two front teeth...'

Instantly feeling the damage done to his mouth after the impact, Yeo was seen flashing his new look to the referee, revealing his splintered teeth with the roots still intact.

The midfielder and ruckman collided after Yeo failed to take an easy mark, the ball slipping through his grasp, right before the half-time siren.

It was reported by afl.com.au that trainers were unable to find the teeth.

Yeo's teammate Xavier Ellis, told The Age that he was confident Yeo had been wearing his mouthguard right up until the moment of impact.

'I think he had it in for the majority of the night and took it out for 30 seconds to have a breather. I don't think he'll do that again,' Ellis said.

'I think he just took it out for literally 30 seconds and the ball came, so it's a hefty price to pay.'

Despite the blow, Yeo shook off the injury and somehow soldiered on.

'It was a big knock … he should have taken the mark,' Eagles coach Adam Simpson told afl.com.au.

'He
 kept on going, I don’t know if he was in a hell of a lot of pain or 
not, but he didn’t seem to take a backward step after it.'

Unfazed by the incident: Yeo was in good humour after the game and fired off this cheeky tweet

Yeo played the second half and ended the match with 19 disposals and a goal in the Eagles' eventual eight-point loss to the Magpies.

After the game, Yeo tweeted a cheeky reference to the knock: 'All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth...'

His teeth are expected to be capped this week as long as there has been no splintering and no nerve damage.

Despite the injury, Yeo is expected to be back in action on Sunday for a clash against North Melbourne.
