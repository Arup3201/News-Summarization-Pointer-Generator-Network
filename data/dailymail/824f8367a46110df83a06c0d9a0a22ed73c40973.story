Instead, their partners, relatives and friends were sent wilted, crushed and sparse arrangements.

Some even received the wrong bouquets - while others were apparently not sent flowers at all.

Another user, Jeremy Holmes, poked fun at the  delivery disaster, uploading a picture of a bouquet of red roses, as advertised on the company's website, alongside an image of a chicken in a jumper.

He tweeted: 'what the hell @1800flowers, what I ordered vs. what I got', adding: 'My girlfriend doesn't even like chicken'. 

His post was retweeted 30 times and 'favorited' a further 29 times.

It is unclear what caused the 1-800-Flowers orders to arrive disfigured - or fail to arrive at all.

It is possible  the severe wind chills and sub-zero temperatures that swept across the US over the weekend could have affected packages left on recipients' doorsteps, or slowed down deliveries.

But whatever the reason, many customers accused the firm of ruining Valentine's Day. 

Jena Nieves tweeted: '@1800flowers sent my sister DEAD & ROTTED flowers. Thanks for ruining a special day!'

'Due to the weather issues we experienced, wait times are longer than we would like.'
