A father in Kenosha, Wisconsin has taken out a restraining order against his daughter's bully, after the 6-year-old received death threats from a 5-year-old boy in her kindergarten class.

Brian Metzger says the boy has been bulling his daughter all year, kicking her, throwing rocks and sand in her face and making similar threats to other children at Prarie Land Elementary School.

'She came home and said a student threatened her by saying, "I want to slit your throat and watch you bleed,"' Metzger told WISN.

'There's not a set threshold of what causes or what would determine when a child is moved out of a classroom,' Ruder explained.

A restraining order hearing is set for next Tuesday, and Metzger is hoping to get the 5-year-old boy expelled.

'I want him removed from the school district, period,' Metzger told CBS 58.
