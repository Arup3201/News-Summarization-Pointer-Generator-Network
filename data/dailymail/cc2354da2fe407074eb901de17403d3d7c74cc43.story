A spy plane equipped with a thermal imaging camera has found that more than 6,000 outbuildings in one town could be 'beds in sheds' converted by rogue landlords.

Slough Borough Council is the first local authority in the country to pay for the specially-adapted aircraft to fly over streets picking up heat from sheds and garages.

It spent £24,000 on flights to build up a precise 3D map of every building in the Berkshire town. The results mean thousands could be living there without planning permission or contributing council tax.

Welcome to Slough: This thermogram image shows data recovered after flying over the town, with the red representing high levels of heat escaping. The council said the imaging helps them identify outhouses because the cameras can pick up areas of high heat loss - although few can be seen outside the houses in this snippet

Normally: This satellite view from Google Maps shows the area captured by the 3D thermal imaging software in Slough, Berkshire. A school is seen to the right, while the rest of the area is mostly residential

Illegal: Councils want to crack down on rogue landlords turning sheds into illegal and often substandard living accommodation, such as this conversion in nearby Slough

The plane criss-crossed streets, picking 
up heat signals from outbuildings which could signify they are being 
used as ‘sheds with beds’.

Analysis
 of the images captured in the two-hour night flight has now revealed a 
staggering 6,350 suspicious dwellings in the borough.

Although
 many of the outbuildings are habitable, some are described as being 
unsafe, with little or no heating, or do not comply with building or 
fire safety regulations.

Landlords
 face £200 fines and the prospect of their so called 'beds in sheds' 
being demolished if caught illegally renting them out.

Bottom of garden: Large numbers of homes are believed to have converted outbuildings like this one without permission. Thousands could be living in Slough without planning permission or contributing council tax

The council commissioned aerial imaging 
company Bluesky International to produce a thermal map of the town to 
target dodgy landlords and people living under the radar.

During
 a single flight in March they gathered thermal, 3D and aerial images 
which allowed officers to pinpoint warm areas in outbuildings.

Initial
 analysis of the images from just a small part of the town highlighted 
211 buildings that needed further investigation, but a further 6,139 
have now been identified.

A
 spokesman for the council said the outbuildings do not have planning 
permission to be used as accommodation and further checks will now be 
carried out to find out if people are living in them.

house immigrants (computerised image over the River Thames in London)

Growing problem: Slough Council estimates there are up to 3,000 'beds in sheds' in the Berkshire town. It has been granted extra Government funding to help improve the condition of houses in multiple occupancy

'The raw data we've received from 
Bluesky is very useful because for the first time it gives us an 
accurate figure of the number of outbuildings we have in the borough 
that we need to investigate,' said Ray Haslam, head of environmental 
services and resilience at Slough Borough Council.

'This certainly gives us a good starting point and we've already started investigative work'

Ray Haslam, Slough Borough Council

'People may well be using their 
outbuildings for legitimate purposes, so we don't want to rush into 
assumptions that they're all being used for housing, but this certainly 
gives us a good starting point and we've already started investigative 
work.'

Slough Borough Council has been 
granted extra Government funding to help improve the condition of houses
 in multiple occupancy and reduce the number of beds in sheds.

A project team has been set up who 
will liaise with other agencies such as the police, Fire and Rescue 
service, Home Office and HMRC as part of the clamp down.

Cut backs: People living in these illegal conversions use council services but do not contribute any council tax towards them - so town halls use thermal imaging to find them

Out the back: Some of the buildings uncovered in Slough may be allowed to remain a dwelling but others will be demolished. The council spent thousands sending up an aircraft with thermal-imaging equipment

A
 spokesman for the authority said those found living in illegal 
accommodation will be offered help finding somewhere else to live and 
welfare advice.

'This issue has been of concern to us locally for some time and I am pleased strong foundations are now in place to enable us to tackle it effectively'

Slough Councillor James Swindlehurst

The council's planning enforcement team has the power to force the demolition of illegal dwellings or demand they are returned to their legal use, such as a garage or store room.

Councillor James Swindlehurst, deputy leader and commission for neighbourhoods and renewal, said: 'This issue has been of concern to us locally for some time and I am pleased strong foundations are now in place to enable us to tackle it effectively.

'Our primary concern is the health and wellbeing of people living in the outbuildings and we will be doing whatever the law allows us to do to protect them and hold rogue landlords to account, as well as enforcing regulations.'
