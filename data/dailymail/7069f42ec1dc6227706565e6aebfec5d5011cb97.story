J.C. Penney has announced it will open its doors on Thanksgiving evening to kick off the holiday shopping season, as the beleaguered retailer hopes to get back in the game for the crucial selling period.

The Plano, Texas-based chain will be opening most of its 1,100 stores at 8pm, the same as rival Macy's.

The Thanksgiving evening opening is much earlier than last year, when Penney didn't open until 6am Friday. That made the retailer one of the laggards for the unofficial kickoff to the season.

Penney is also bringing back a tradition
it ditched last year: it will give away nearly two million holiday snow 
globes starting at 4am on the Friday after the turkey feast.

'Obviously, we were one of the last 
to open [last year],' said Tony Bartlett, Penney's executive vice 
president of stores. But he noted this year, 'We're all in.'

He promised that J.C. Penney's deals will be at least as good as two years 
ago and will be much better than last year, when Penney gave away 
buttons tied to a prize giveaway.

Penney is also hiring at least 35,000 seasonal workers for the holidays, nearly 50 per cent more than a year ago.

Competitive: The store is hoping its strategy will lead to improved sales

The holiday plan is yet another example of how Penney is unraveling the 
strategies of its former CEO Ron Johnson, who was ousted in April after 
17 months on the job amid a botched up plan to reinvent the retailer.

Johnson was fired two months after the company announced horrific 
fourth-quarter results that covered the holiday shopping season. That 
ended a fiscal year, which finished February 2, in which the Penney amassed 
almost a billion dollars in losses and a 25 per cent drop in sales.

Penney brought back Johnson's predecessor, Mike Ullman, as CEO. He is 
restoring frequent sales and basic merchandise that were eliminated by 
Johnson who was aiming to attract a more affluent, younger shopper.

Uproar: Macy's says that most of its stores will open on the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday for the first time in its history, in a sign of how competitive the holiday season is shaping up

Shares were down 12 cents to close at $7.35 Thursday and have lost 63 
per cent of their value since the beginning of the year. The stock has 
lost 83 per cent of its value since early February of last year.

Stores are ushering the holiday season earlier every year, creeping into
Thanksgiving. Macy's scheduled 8pm opening on Thanksgiving compares 
with its midnight Friday opening in 2012.

Last year, Target Corp. opened its doors at 9pm on Thanksgiving, 
three hours earlier than the previous year.

Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the 
world's largest retailer, began the early bird specials at 8pm on the 
holiday, two hours earlier than in 2011. A growing number of mall-based 
clothing stores like Gap also have opened their doors on Thanksgiving 
Day.

Target, Wal-Mart and Gap have not yet announced their plans for the Thanksgiving weekend.
