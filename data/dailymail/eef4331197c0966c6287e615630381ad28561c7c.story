A businessman who paid Eastern European workers just £30-a-day to pick crops in the fields charged them £30-a-week to sleep on mattresses on the derelict ground floor of a former pub, a court has heard. 

Mohammed Aslam, 71, lived in the upstairs area of the The Smut Inn in Oldham, Greater Manchester, and he had converted it into a modern living area with high standards.

But Oldham Magistrates' Court heard that the ground floor, where up to ten men slept on mattresses, was squalid and did not have any heating.

Council officials believe that up to ten men slept on the ground floor of the pub without heating

The men were also expected to wash in the former pub's toilets, while a fire escape had been jammed closed with a paint roller, meaning it could not be opened easily in the case of an emergency.

Oldham Council said the men living at the property told investigators that they were being paid £30 per day to pick coriander in the fields of North Wales and East Yorkshire.

But they were also made to pay £30 per week for their squalid accommodation.

There was no heating and the lighting could only be controlled from one switch behind the old bar.

Photographs from inside the property were taken by Oldham Council who prosecuted the property's owner Mohammed Aslam, 71.

They showed that many of the pub's windows are boarded up.

But despite the poor conditions downstairs the council found that Aslam lived on the first floor of the property which had recently been renovated to a high standard

Last year Environmental Health Officers were informed by the police that the men were staying on the ground floor of the property.

Aslam paid his tenants £30-a-day to work in fields picking crops of coriander across Wales and Yorkshire

The ground floor of the building, which used to be The Smut Inn, did not have any proper washing facilities

The ground floor area which used to be the bar had been partitioned into separate 'bedrooms', pictured, 

Officers arranged with Greater Manchester Police and Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service to visit the premises just after midnight on July 1, last year.

The owner Aslam had just arrived back from work with the men who were all working for him.

When officers went into the property they found the bar still in situ but the seating area had been poorly partitioned off to make bedrooms.

A prohibition order was served at the time of the visit stating that an interlinked fire detection system was to be installed or the workers were not allowed to stay there.

A follow up visit carried out by officers on September 10, last year revealed that the prohibition order hadn't been complied with and there was still workers living there.

Legal proceedings were then launched by the council.

At Oldham Magistrates Court Aslam pleaded guilty to 11 offences under the Housing Act 2004 of Management of Houses in Multiple Occupation (England) Regulations 2006.

He was fined £2,200 with £2,600 costs.

Councillor Dave Hibbert, Cabinet Member for Housing, Planning and Transport, said: 'In this day and age it is shocking that a landlord would allow their tenants to live in such a poorly maintained property.

'The council gave Aslam an opportunity to put the faults right in his property but he failed to do so.

'All landlords have a responsibility to their tenants and must ensure that the properties they rent out are safe and healthy to live in. We will take action against those who think they can get away with letting out substandard properties.

'Oldham Council is committed to working with landlords for the benefit of all the Borough's residents.'
