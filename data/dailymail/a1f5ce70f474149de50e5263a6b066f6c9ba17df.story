A four-day search for an Arkansas man and his ten-month-old son came to a grim end on Tuesday as authorities discovered their bodies in a remote area of the Ouachita Mountains, authorities said Tuesday.

Brooke Floyd, 21, who was the wife of Brian Floyd, 33, and mother of Harper Floyd, remained in jail on Tuesday on a preliminary charge of endangering the welfare of a minor.

She was seen with her husband and son on Friday morning, hours before she was found wandering alone on a remote dirt track in the area, which is about 80 miles west of Little Rock.

At the time, she looked 'cut up and scarred as if she had been in a wooded area,' Yell County Sheriff Bill Gilkey told the Southwest Times Record.

He said Brooke Floyd 'spoke of a separation Friday night' and listed her marital status as 'single' on the police report.

'Investigators are still trying to get to the bottom of what caused the separation,' Gilkey added.

Brooke Floyd didn't initially cooperate with the search effort and was arrested over the weekend on the child endangerment complaint, but she later led authorities to the family's truck, which was towed from the area on Tuesday.

Gilkey said searchers found Harper's body
 in the mountainous terrain at around 1.30pm and found his father's 
about an hour later. The bodies were taken to the state crime lab for 
autopsies.

A backpack was alongside the bodies and an unidentified material, according to News 5. Investigators did not find a weapon at the scene.

'It's
 not the outcome we certainly had hoped for and our prayers and thoughts
 go out to the families involved,' Gilkey said at a news conference at 
the remote site.

Gilkey said investigators don't know yet whether they consider Brooke Floyd a suspect or a victim. The officer would not speculate on whether she will face additional charges.

Nobody responded to a message seeking comment left on Tuesday at a number listed as hers.

The sheriff said late on Tuesday that investigators were meeting with county prosecutors to go over the case, and said the review could take several days. Gilkey did not say whether the deaths were the result of homicide or accident.

'Right now, it's still the same; we're still in meetings, going back over everything that's happened since 1:30 p.m. last Friday,' Gilkey told the AP by phone.

The Floyds, who lived in Greenwood, were seen together in a green pickup truck in Mansfield on Thursday evening and again the next morning in Yell County, between Moore's Chapel Cemetery and Lick Creek Recreation Area.

According to an arrest report, Brian Floyd was previously questioned by police on July 20 after he falsely reported a burglary at his home. 

The report, seen by 5 News, reported that the 911 dispatcher told responding officers that the caller had a history of mental illness.

Officers found Brian Floyd driving around his home in a 'manic state' and hallucinating, claiming that a woman had broken in and there was a police officer on the roof with a dog.

Police reported no disturbances at the property. A family member told police he was having problems with his medication.
