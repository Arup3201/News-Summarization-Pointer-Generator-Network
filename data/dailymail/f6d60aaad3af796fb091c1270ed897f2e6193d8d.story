The beer made famous by television's favourite cartoon dad has been labelled 'dangerous' by doctors.

Australian Medical Association president Steve Hambleton has warned plans by Woolworths to stock the new alcoholic beer, Duff, in their BWS and Dan Murphys stores from May 28 would increase 'the social acceptability of alcohol misuse'.

'People have been watching The Simpsons for years, this is ready-made product placement and dangerous exposure to people misusing alcohol,' he said.

Duff Beer has been made into a easily recognisable brand by Homer Simpson who loves drinking it on The Simpsons

'Weâ€™ve talked in the past about the effects of exposing young children to alcohol advertising, here it is in spades.'

The Simpsons cartoon has been airing on Channel Ten for more than 20 years.

But the supermarket giant has hit back at the claims.

A Woolworths Liquor Group spokeswoman said The Simpsons would be left out of promotional materials for Duff and the group had followed alcohol advertising codes.

The brand of Duff Beer features heavily in The Simpsons, especially in the episode where the TV family go on a trip to the Duff Gardens amusement park where they encounter mascot, Surly

She also added there would be no press, outdoor or website advertisements for the beer.

A pop-up bar dedicated to the beer's Australian landing is being held at Sydney's Woolloomooloo Bay Hotel for seven days and Duff also has its own Facebook page. But the spokeswoman stressed to the Canberra Times that 'all materials have adhered to alcohol advertising codes'.

Dr Hambleton's comments come after repeated calls from the AMA to launch a parliamentary inquiry into alcohol advertising.

He said research showed underage drinking prevents young people from realising when they are drunk.

It has been quite a trial for Duff beer to even make it to Australian shores.

In the 1990s, brewers Lion Nathan were unsuccessful in trying to produce a version of the beer after the move was blocked by Twentieth Century Fox, who own the trademark to the brand, in the Federal Court in 1996.

Perth's Allstates Liquor Wholesalers were handed a 'cease and desist' by Fox in 2011 after stocking a beer called 'Legendary Duff Beer' with a remarkably similar label and logo to the one depicted in The Simpsons.
