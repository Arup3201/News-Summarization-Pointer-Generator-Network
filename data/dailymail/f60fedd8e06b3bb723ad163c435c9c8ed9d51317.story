Downloadable games that encourage children to spend parents' cash to proceed are being probed by the Office of Fair Trading

Video games that pressure children into spending hundreds of pounds when playing online face a crackdown from the Office Of Fair Trading.

Many computer, console and mobile phone games offer players the opportunity to buy extra lives or abilities when online.

It has led to many parents being left with huge credit card or mobile phone bills.

Now an OFT investigation has found children are particularly vulnerable because they could feel they are letting other players down if they do not buy the content.

Many games also blurred the distinction between spending virtual currency and real money and used statements or images to encourage children to make a purchase.

The investigation found some games included ‘potentially unfair and aggressive commercial practices to which children may be particularly susceptible’.

Now the OFT has proposed payments made by children while playing games online will not be deemed authorised, and should not be taken, unless the account holder - such as a parent - has given their informed consent.

And they state that consumers should be told upfront about potential costs for playing the games, and any other important information such as whether their personal details will be shared with third parties.

But Martin Lewis, founder of MoneySavingExpert.com, has criticised the OFT proposals as ‘flaccid’.

He said: ‘When games like My Little Pony and others charge £69 a pop for children to buy “gems”, there is something almost sinister happening.

‘Many of these free games take advantage of children’s confusion between virtual and real money and some parents’ technical illiteracy.

‘The OFT consultation is flaccid - the problems are apparent and games makers and app stores need to be held to account.

Children can unknowingly run up bills of hundreds playing games that have been downloaded for 'free'

‘We need rules that stop bait pricing on games predominantly marketed or targeted at children: wealth warnings both at the start of games and inside app stores to indicate it is an in-app purchase game, and caps put on how much can be spent on such purchases within an hour, which can only be removed by the cardholder.’

The OFT launched its investigation in April following concerns that users could run up substantial costs paying for content such as upgraded membership or virtual currency in forms including coins, gems or fruit.

Typically, players can access only certain areas of these games for free and must pay for higher levels or features.

OFT executive director Cavendish Elithorn said: ‘This is a new and innovative industry that has grown very rapidly in recent years, but it needs to ensure it is treating consumers fairly and that children are protected.

‘The way the sector has worked with us since we launched our investigation is encouraging, and we’ve already seen some positive changes to its practices.

'These principles provide a clear benchmark for how games makers should be operating. Once they are finalised, we will expect the industry to follow them, or risk enforcement action.

‘In the meantime, we want to hear what parents, consumer groups, industry and anyone else with an interest thinks about our principles before we finalise them later this year.

‘This is a global industry so we’re also sharing our principles with our enforcement partners worldwide with the goal of achieving some common international standards.’

Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the guidelines need to be enforced.

She said: ‘The scandal of online games which try to pressure or trick players into making extra purchases must end. We’ve seen parents turning to us after their children inadvertently run up huge bills for downloads, so we welcome the OFT’s moves to clamp down on the practice.

‘After an unexpected £200 bill landed on his doormat, one of our clients assumed he’d been the victim of fraud. But after approaching his bank, he was told that the bill was in fact down to a game his 10-year-old son enjoyed playing.

'He was shocked to be told that as the extra costs were laid out in the small print, the only way to get his money back would be to sue his son.

‘It’s good to see that the OFT are considering action to make games include clear information on costs, and require authorisation for the account holder before children can make in-app purchases.

'The final rules must be backed up by strong enforcement action to ensure that consumers are properly protected.’

A spokesman at the Department of Culture said: ‘We welcome the OFT’s investigation into this very important issue. The Government is committed to ensuring that consumers, and particularly children, are properly protected.

‘We will be studying the OFT findings and proposed remedies and will be interested to see how the industry responds.’

Credit crunch: Will Smith, 6, unwittingly racked up a £2,000 bill on his grandfather's credit card playing Tiny Monsters (pictured)

Schoolboy Will Smith, 6, unwittingly racked up a £2,000 credit card bill playing an online game on his grandfather’s iPad.

The
little boy was innocently playing the popular children’s video game 
Tiny Monsters until his grandfather Barry Slatter, 55, was contacted by 
the fraud squad last year.

The family was unaware of little Will’s 
huge spending spree until his grandmother tried to use the credit card 
at Tesco, only to have it declined.

When the fraud squad contacted Mr Slatter, of Redcar, North Yorkshire, he was horrified to discover the bill spent on the app.

Tiny Monsters is a ‘breeding’ game where gamers collect and create monsters to fill their virtual island. While the game is free to download the app has 'premium currency' which gamers can buy using real money.

Using his grandfather’s iTunes password, Will bought virtual food and coins costing up to £70 each while playing different levels on the game to reach the Dark Monster.
