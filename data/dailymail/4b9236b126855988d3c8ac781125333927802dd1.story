A male student has been shot dead at Liberty University in Virgina for 'attacking' a campus police officer inside a women-only dorm.

Joshua Hathaway, 19, from Lubbock, Texas, has been confirmed as the deceased.

Hathaway was shot two times by the officer about 4.10am Tuesday during an 'physical altercation' in the lobby of the off-campus residence, according to the Roanoke Times.

'Joshua Hathaway, a Liberty University student, told the security officer he had been robbed and someone stole his vehicle,' Lynchburg police detective Collin Byrn filed in a search warrant affidavit.

'The security officer then began to investigate Hathaway's complaint but Hathaway then pulled out a hammer from his clothing and assaulted the officer.'

During the struggle, the officer fired two shots at Hathaway, fatally striking him at least once.

Officers found Hathaway's car in a nearby parking lot and are unsure why he reported it missing.

Byrne also spoke with Hathaway's roommate, who said Hathaway 'had been displaying unusual behavior recently'.

The officer involved was taken to Lynchburg General Hospital to be treated for 
unspecified injuries and has since been 'relieved from duty', pending a further investigation.

'This appears to be an isolated incident and there is not any ongoing concern for the safety of students or the community,' city police spokesman Lt. Dave Gearhart said.

'We are not currently seeking any suspects in relation to this incident.'

The drama unfolded inside Residential Annex II, which reportedly houses more than 200 female students and is 3.4 miles from campus.

The university, a private institution, was operating as normal following the shooting.

Liberty University is a 3 1/2-hour drive southwest of Washington, between Charlottesville and the North Carolina border. 

Originally founded as a small Baptist college by television preacher Jerry Falwell in 1971, the evangelical Christian school now enrolls more than 74,000 students — nearly 62,000 of them working toward degrees online — and has become the largest university in Virginia and the largest private, nonprofit university in the country. 

It is also the nation’s largest university with a religious affiliation.
