The head of the IMF has refused to ‘go on my knees’ to apologise to George Osborne for wrongly warning his austerity cuts would harm the British economy.

Christine Lagarde admitted ‘we got it wrong’ after the global financial watchdog warned the UK Chancellor he was ‘playing with fire’ by pressing ahead despite a sluggish recovery.

Pressed repeatedly on whether she had apologised to Mr Osborne in person, Miss Lagarde admitted mistakes in growth forecasts but hit back: ‘Do I have to go on my knees and bend over backwards to say it?’

IMF chief Christine Lagarde has admitted getting it wrong on British growth, after urging Chancellor George Osborne to change course on the cuts

Last year, the International Monetary Fund caused a huge row when it claimed Government cuts were harming the prospects for the economy.

It warned Britain was ‘still a long way from a strong and sustainable recovery’.

Olivier Blanchard, chief economist at the IMF, said Mr Osborne was 'playing with fire' by pressing ahead with austerity before the recovery gathers pace.

He added: 'In the face of weak demand it is really time to reconsider an adjustment to the fiscal consolidation plans.'

But over the past year the economy has recovered and the IMF has since upgraded forecasts four times in a row.

The IMF now expects growth of 2.9 per cent rate of growth in 2014, putting Britain on course to grow faster than any of the G7 richest countries, including the US, Germany and France.

Appearing on BBC One’s Andrew Marr show, Miss Lagarde was pressed repeatedly on whether she had apologised to Mr Osborne for the IMF’s strident warnings which turned out to be wrong.

‘We said very clearly that we had underestimated growth for the UK and that we had, our forecasts, had been proven wrong by the reality of economic developments and I’m happy to repeat it for you.’

In April the International Monetary Fund was forced to admit the UK economy was on course to grow by 2.9 per cent this year, faster than any other G7 country

Miss Largarde admitted that Mr Osborne had faced intense pressure to change course after the IMF criticism, ‘but he resisted, as he would’.

Asked several times if she had said sorry, she hit back: ‘I completely acknowledge that we underestimated growth. Now, do I have to go on my knees and bend over backwards to say it?

‘We got it wrong. We acknowledged it. We were not the only ones to get it wrong, we were in good company actually.

‘Most forecasters got it wrong, and clearly the confidence building that has resulted from the economic policies adopted by the government has surprised many of us.’

After being in the economic doldrums for many months, the UK economy is growing faster than most major economies – and crucially is not relying on consumer spending to fuel the boom.

‘It is growth is fuelled both by consumption but also now investment, but not just public investment as we recommended earlier on, but also with private investment,’ Miss Lagarde added.

‘Exports is lagging behind a little bit, but those two big cylinders of growth, consumption and investment, are fuelling growth, which in our view makes it more sustainable than if it was fuelled exclusively by consumption as was feared a few months back.’

She warned risks remained on low productivity and rising housing prices, but asked if there was a property boom in Britain, Miss Lagarde replied: ‘No. What our team has clearly seen and acknowledged is that the housing market in the UK is multi-faceted.’
