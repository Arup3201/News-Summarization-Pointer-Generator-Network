A grieving mother whose newborn baby died six months ago is facing fresh heartbreak as she prepares to say goodbye to her terminally ill husband but says he can be a 'daddy in heaven'.

Kelly Francis from Cedar Springs, Michigan, was shocked when her college sweetheart Jake was diagnosed with cancer, just months after they started dating in 2004.

But Mr Francis beat the disease after receiving chemotherapy treatement and the couple were married in 2007.

Kelly and Jake Francis with their son Evan. The couple's daughter Avery died shortly after birth and now Mr Francis has been told he only has five months to live after being diagnosed with cancer 

Baby Avery who died shortly after birth. Mrs Francis was told just 17 weeks into her pregnancy that Avery had multicycstic dysplastic kidneys, which prevented her lungs from growing 

However, by 2009, Mr Francis was diagnosed with a different form of testicular cancer and told that it couldn't be cured.

The couple then decided to have a child together, even though they knew that one day Mrs Francis would have to raise the baby on her own and found out she was expecting twins.

Mrs Francis told WXMI: 'I was so overwhelmed and blessed of course and feeling so grateful that I had two children.

'But, I was scared because I knew someday I’d be raising them on my own.'

But just 17 weeks into her pregnancy, she was told her unborn daughter Avery had multicycstic dysplastic kidneys, which prevented her lungs from growing.

Mrs Francis knew that when she fell pregnant she would become a single mother after Mr Francis had been told his testicular cancer was terminal 

Their son Evan was born healthy although Avery died shortly after birth.

But rather than looking to the future with their new baby, the couple are now having to contend with the fact Mr Francis has been given just five months to live.

Mrs Francis is now a stay-at-home mother and also has to care for her husband who is now unable to continue his work as a nurse.

But even though after his death the family will be physically separated, Mrs Francis says they still consider themselves as lucky.

Mrs Francis told her terminally ill husband that he will get to be a father in heaven to Avery while she will look after Evan here 

She told Fox 6: 'I feel like we were blessed with twins because Jake is too good of a father not to be one in heaven.

'He gets Avery in heaven and I get Evan here.'

Now the local community are rallying around the couple and raising money for them so they can enjoy as much time as possible together.

The couple's friend and fundraiser McKenzie Pepper said: 'It would be amazing to give them the gift of time, together as a family, so that Kelly doesn’t have to worry about working.

'So, they can spend as much time together with Evan.'
