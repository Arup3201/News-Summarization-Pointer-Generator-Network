Annual digital sales of music, games and films have passed the £1billion mark for the first time and now make up almost a quarter of the entertainment market.

The value of downloads to home computers, tablets and smartphones rose 11.4 per cent to £1.033billion in 2012, according to the Entertainment Retailers Association (ERA).

By contrast, physical sales of CDs, DVDs and computer games are in sharp decline, down 17.6 per cent on 2011, although they still dominate more than three quarters of the market.

Revolution: Sales of digital music through programs like iTunes (above), games and films have broken the £1billion barrier for the first time

Many are bought from web retailers, such as Amazon or the major supermarkets.

The trend has led to the demise of 
thousands of specialist shops, including Game, and threatens the future 
of HMV, the last national high street chain.

ERA chief Kim Bayley said: ‘Breaching 
the £1billion barrier is an incredible achievement for the UK’s digital 
entertainment retailers and reflects their huge investment in new and 
innovative services which means you can buy music, video and games 
literally at any time of the day and wherever you are.’

Separate figures from the music 
industry trade body, the BPI, confirm a switch from buying CD albums 
towards digital downloads and individual songs.

It found there were 100.5million 
album sales in 2012, down by 11.2 per cent on the year before. Of those 
sales, two thirds were CDs.

However, these were themselves down by 19 per cent. Downloads were up by 14.8 per cent.

In decline: Physical sales of CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray and video games still account for more than three quarters of the entertainment market, but sales fell by 17.6 per cent compared to 2011

Sales of singles rose 6 per cent to 188.6million, 99.6 per cent of which were bought as digital downloads.

British acts dominated the albums sales list this year, with Emeli Sandé on top, ahead of Adele and Ed Sheeran.

The most popular singles were more 
likely to feature foreign urban and R&B stars, led by top seller 
Somebody That I Used To Know by Gotye, featuring Kimbra.

Only two British artists made the top ten selling singles – X Factor winner James Arthur and The Voice judge Jessie J.

Apart from sales, Britons streamed 
3.7billion songs from websites and subscription services that allow them
to listen to music without owning it or downloading it.

Emerging trends: The top ten albums of 2012 was dominated by uncontroversial British pop such as Emili Sande (left), while the best-selling singles featured tracks by overseas acts such as Gotye (right)
