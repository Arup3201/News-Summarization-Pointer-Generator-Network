The future of the region's biggest and best-preserved Roman site has been thrown into doubt.

Binchester Roman Town in County Durham, has been put up for sale by the Church Commissioners and archaeologists fear the historic site could fall into the hands of developers.

The Roman settlement was dubbed 'the Pompeii of the North' in July after archaeologists unearthed some of the most exciting historical finds in living memory.

Rubbish thrown away by the Romans 2,000 years ago had the same effect as the ash of Vesuvius, preserving the world's most intact bath house outside Italy.

Excavations at Binchester, near Bishop Auckland, unearthed artefacts including one of the earliest pieces of evidence for Christianity in Roman Britain in the shape of a silver ring.

An inscribed altar dedicated to the Roman Goddess Fortune the Home-bringer, was also discovered. But now the land where the settlement has stood for around 1,800 years is being sold off as part of 10 plots around Bishop Auckland, including two which cover the Binchester site.

Discovery: Buried
 on the site of a Roman fort in County Durham, archaeologists have made a
 series of well-preserved and extraordinary finds. The discoveries date 
back 1,800 years and include one of the earliest pieces of evidence for 
Christianity in Roman Britain in the shape of a silver ring (pictured)

The Auckland Castle Trust, financed by London philanthropist Jonathan Ruffer, has made a £2m bid for the plots.

Although
 the Roman settlement itself could not be developed, an old hall on one 
of the plots could be, affecting access to the site. Selling the plots 
off separately could also hamper archaeologists' work, it is feared.

The
 Trust's head curator, Dr Christopher Ferguson, said Binchester Hall is 
one of the plots for sale and has outline planning permission to be 
developed into housing or a hotel.

If
 the land is commercially developed there will be no public access to 
the fort,' he said. 'The fort will have to close to the public at least.

The many finds at the site include this small carnelian intaglio, which is thought to have been worn as jewellery

The Church Commission has defended the sale, saying no work could be carried out on the 'protected' site and public access would have to be maintained.

'This is the largest Roman town in the north, but it is also the least excavated and understood.

'The archaeological excavations currently undertaken by Durham University are also in jeopardy and this sale could knock back their work for generations.

'The bath house is unparalleled in Roman Britain and its future survival if the site is sold to the wrong buyer would be thrown into question.'

A church spokesperson said: 'We are disappointed that such an excellent body as the Auckland Castle Trust do not recognise the statutory protections in operation for Binchester Fort.

'Binchester Roman Fort is a scheduled ancient monument under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979.

'As such there are strict statutory protections for the Fort which make it a criminal offence to carry out any works which would demolish, damage, remove, repair, add or alter the monument without permission from the Secretary of State.

'In addition Durham County Council retains a Deed of Guardianship for the site which ensures public access.

'These statutory protections will continue to apply to any prospective purchaser of the land.

'Since announcing the sale the Commissioners have received a number of expressions of interest from a number of parties, including from the existing tenants, for single and multiple lots.

'The process for the sale of the Bishop Auckland Estate is transparent and leaves no room for undue influence by any interested party. All offers will be considered without prejudice or preference.

'All parties have been advised that any offers will not be considered until next month.'

The Trust is urging members of the public to contact the Church Commissioners expressing their concerns. Formal offers for the plots have to be in by September 18.
