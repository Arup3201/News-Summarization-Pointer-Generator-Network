Children as young as 13 are being given lessons in combating cyber terrorism amid concerns over the UK’s vulnerability to attacks similar to the hacking of entertainment giant Sony.

Those behind the scheme include experts at the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the top-secret organisation that provides electronic surveillance of the nation’s enemies.

The Government is taking the scheme so seriously that next summer’s GCSE computer science exam will contain questions about cyber security for the first time.

Target: A scene from The Interview, the film at the centre of recent hacking

Experts say there is a dire shortage of specialists able to defend Britain’s computer systems from increasingly sophisticated assaults by hostile states and terrorists.

Sony was recently the victim of hackers, who released large numbers of confidential emails in an attempt to stop the release of The Interview, a comedy mocking North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The fear is that a similar online assault on Britain would dangerously compromise parts of the Government.

Security expert Professor Anthony Glees, from Buckingham University, said: ‘The next conflict may not just be about bombs and bullets – it will almost certainly involve massive cyber attacks.’ 

Under the Government-funded initiative, GCHQ and other organisations including the National Crime Agency (NCA), are creating lesson plans that can be incorporated in computer classes for 14- to 16-year-olds. Those students aged 13 who show a real aptitude for maths will also be taught the skills.

GCHQ has created an app for children that explains encryption techniques, and allows children to create their own encoded messages.

The Cryptoy app also details the history of codes, including the decrypting of the Nazi Enigma machine that helped to end the Second World War.

As part of the lesson plans being rolled out in schools, the NCA has produced case studies on the risks in a number of technically complex areas. Another plan designed by telecoms giant BT teaches children the basics of computer firewalls, while a third warns of the dangers of computer viruses such as ‘trojans’ and ‘worms’.

Nearly 800 schools have signed up for the new package, from the exclusive Cheltenham Ladies’ College to top state school King Edward VI grammar in Chelmsford, Essex.

One exam board has already provided a sample question for next summer’s computer science GCSEs. It asks pupils to design a system to prevent a thief who steals their mobile phone from using credits on it to take free rides on a bus.

GCHQ has also set up several university degree courses to train students in computer security.

Chris Ensor, of GCHQ, said: ‘It is vital that we tap into, enthuse and encourage the flourishing talent in our schools. We need gifted teenagers like these coming into the cyber security profession.’
