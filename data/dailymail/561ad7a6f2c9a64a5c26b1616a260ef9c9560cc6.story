Target for thieves: Jars of Manuka honey are being protected with security tags in some Tesco stores

When you’re at the supermarket check-out, you invariably have to wait while the assistant wrestles the security tag off certain items.

A bottle of gin? Only to be expected. A packet of razors? Safety first. A jar of honey? Erm …

But that’s exactly what some Tesco customers will encounter the next time they try to buy a jar of Manuka honey, which retails at more than £20 and is the latest health food craze.

The manager at one Tesco store has decided to lock the jars in plastic security boxes because they are proving so tempting to thieves. The boxes set off an alarm if they are taken out of the shop.

The honey, highly prized for its antibacterial properties, joins an increasingly long list of items security tagged to stop unlikely middle-class shoplifters walking off with them.

They include organic chickens, Christmas turkeys and even some kinds of expensive cheese.

Tough economic conditions mean some middle-class shoppers are turning to theft to maintain their standard of living, experts say.

Tesco has given its store managers the freedom to choose which products it puts in the security boxes, based on which are stolen most frequently.

A manager at the Newmarket Road store in Cambridge, one of the most affluent cities in the country, has decided to use the boxes to protect its stock of Manuka honey.

Professor Joshua Bamfield, director of the Centre for Retail Research, calculates that shop theft by customers and staff adds up to £4.9billion a year in the UK.

‘Manuka honey is so expensive,’ he said.

‘The fact is that you have people with expensive tastes but not necessarily the money in their pockets to pay for them.

'The problems with the economy, society, politicians and the banking industry have led many people to say “it’s alright to steal. I’ve got to look after myself because everyone is looking after themselves”.’

He added: ‘In the past someone might have been offered knock-off DVDs in a pub, but it is a little difficult to think of someone doing the same with a jar of honey.

‘That said, where you have an expensive product like this there is always an opportunity to sell it on through street markets and  car boot sales.’

Retail security experts Checkpoint Systems have highlighted the emergence of middle-class thieves.

A spokesman said: ‘You might have a good income and lifestyle and want to maintain it. There is no typical shoplifter any more. It’s a broad profile across age, ethnic group, gender and income bands.’

Manuka honey has been promoted by the likes of tennis player Novak Djokovic and singer Katie Melua.

It is extremely expensive, due to high demand and the fact that relatively small quantities are produced each year.

Such is demand that manufacturers sometimes mix it with common honey to produce cheaper, mass market versions.

The unique honey has been shown to have antibacterial effects. Advocates claim it maintains health and can combat skin problems and allergies.
