The Utah woman accused of concealing seven pregnancies before strangling or suffocating her newborns also hid her growing belly when she was carrying her two eldest daughters, now in their early 20s, authorities revealed Wednesday.

Investigators say they already have an initial theory as to why Megan Huntsman would have killed six of her babies, but aren't discussing it publicly Pleasant Grove Police Capt Mike Roberts said.

Roberts revealed Wednesday that family didn't know Huntsman was pregnant with her two oldest children until the moment she went into labor at the hospital. Neighbors have said they never knew she was pregnant, 
though they now remember weight fluctuations and toggling between baggy 
and tight clothes.

'So, she apparently knows how to do it,' Roberts said.

Home delivery: On Wednesday, it was revealed that Megan Huntsman gave birth to all six of the babies she's accused of murdering at home, and not a hospital

Investigators have determined that Huntsman, 39, did not got to the hospital to have the babies, but instead gave birth at home.  Roberts didn't say if anybody 
helped her give birth.

After
 her estranged husband discovered one of the infant corpses in the 
garage this past weekend, Huntsman acknowledged to police that she 
killed six of the babies, put them in plastic bags and then packed them 
inside boxes in the garage of her home south of Salt Lake City over a 
decade from 1996 to 2006. She told police one of the babies was 
stillborn.

Huntsman was arrested Sunday on six counts of murder. She is being held on $6 million bail â€” $1 million for each baby â€” and is due in court Monday for an arraignment.

Her husband, Darren West, told police in his initial interview that he knew nothing about the pregnancies, Roberts said. He has since obtained an attorney and investigators haven't spoken with him again, Roberts said. They are trying to determine his knowledge or involvement.

Hiding it: Huntsman and her estranged husband Darren West have three daughters together, a teenager (center) and two in their early 20s. Family members allegedly didn't know she was pregnant with the two oldest girls until she went into labor at the hospital

Dad? Huntsman claims that all of the babies were born between 1996 and 2006 and that her estranged husband Darren West (pictured) is the father. West has denied paternity, and police are currently conducting a DNA test

If Huntsman's timeline is accurate, that would mean West was living with Huntsman during the time of the births. He went to federal prison in 2006 after pleading guilty to possessing chemicals intended to be used in manufacturing methamphetamine. West was released from a federal prison in California in January and transferred to a halfway house in Salt Lake City.

Through a family spokesman, West has declined comment. The West family has said in a statement released Sunday that they are in a "state of shock and confusion" and that they're mourning "this tragic loss of life."

Utah investigators are examining DNA from the babies to determine who the parents are, studying the bones to find out how long ago the babies died and have questioned family members and neighbors in pursuit of clues about how she did it. They are trying to determine why she did it and who else, if anybody, knew about it or was involved.

Gruesome discovery: Huntsman was arrested after West found a stillborn baby in a box in his parents house on Saturday (pictured above). A subsequent police search discovered six more murdered newborns in boxes

They have not ruled out making more arrests.

On Tuesday, they served a new search warrant at the house of a family member, Roberts said, but that turned up nothing useful.

He said investigators are poring over evidence to find out if Huntsman gave birth and killed any other babies, but they don't believe that to be the case, he said.
