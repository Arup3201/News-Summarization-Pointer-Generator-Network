Adrian Peterson looked relaxed  on Wednesday as he appeared in a Texas courtroom for the first time since being indicted on a felony child abuse charge last month.

Peterson, who had wife Ashley Brown by his side, was present at Wednesday morning's hearing in Conroe during which his lawyer was able to secure an early court date for his case which means he could play again this season. 

The Minnesota Vikings running back wasn't asked to enter a plea, although his lawyer said he will eventually plead not guilty to the charge that carries a penalty of up to two years in prison.

Rusty Hardin, the NFL star's lawyer, secured a trial date of December 1 after arguing that his client was unable to work until the legal situation is resolved. He also argued that Peterson was ‘getting killed’ in the media and couldn't fight back outside the courtroom.

Peterson exited a black Cadillac Escalade outside the courthouse and was asked what he expected during his appearance. 'I don't know. We shall see,' he said. 

He was accompanied by his wife Ashley - the couple have been on-and-off since college days and finally wed earlier this year - and attorney Hardin.

Nearby was a person wearing a wildcat costume and holding a sign that said 'Free AP' in sparkling letters, prompting a chuckle from Hardin.

Several women stood near the courthouse entrance shrieking and talking about how handsome Peterson looked after he entered the building. 

The 2012 MVP, who was put on paid leave by the Vikings under a special roster exemption from the NFL commissioner, is set to plead not guilty to the charges.

Peterson wasn't asked to enter a plea in court on Wednesday, but has previously said that he never intended to harm his four-year-old son by spanking him with a tree branch earlier this year in Montgomery County, north of Houston.

If convicted, Peterson faces up to two years in prison and a £6,200 fine in a case that surfaced as the NFL grapples with several players facing domestic violence allegations.  

On Tuesday, Hardin had revealed that his client planned to plead not guilty.

'If the court asks for a plea tomorrow [and we do expect that to happen] it will very definitely be NOT guilty,' said Mary Flood, a spokesperson for Hardin.

With 10,190 rushing yards to his name, Adrian Peterson faces an uncertain future in the NFL 

She added that she hoped a trial date would be discussed at the 29-year-old's initial appearance at court, but said: 'We don't yet know how the court's docket is looking.'

Wednesday's court appearance comes just days after Peterson posted a series of tweets criticizing the public for 'believing anything' following a shocking report on his previous antics and charity by the Minneapolis Star Tribune.

The Minnesota Vikings running back wrote to his million followers: 'It's SAD how people these days will believe anything reported by media sources that don't take the time to be GREAT.'

Despite the timing of his message - just hours after the report accused his charity of improperly using tens of thousands dollars worth of funds - he later added: 'Just in-general!'

During Wednesday's court appearance, Peterson's lawyer said his client was 'chomping at the bit' to defend himself publicly but has been advised by his lawyers to not fight the battle in the headlines.
