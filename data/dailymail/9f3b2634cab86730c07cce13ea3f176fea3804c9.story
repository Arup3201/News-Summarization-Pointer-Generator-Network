She has sold more than 70 million records, has a reported net worth of £47m and is one of the world's most adored celebrities - but life wasn't always so easy for Kylie Minogue.

The pop star has revealed that times were once so tough, she even had to make her own clothes out of fabric she snapped up at the local market.

Speaking to MailOnline at Monday night's British Fashion Awards, the 46-year-old said: 'There are great designers on Dover Street who are making their own pieces out of bits and pieces that they find at the market.

Life wasn't always so rosy: Kylie Minogue was just one of the many stars who walked the red carpet at the 2014 British Fashion Awards held at the London Coliseum on Monday night

'I love them because that's what I used to do. I would make my own clothes because I am too small and nothing ever fitted me and I had no money.'

Times have most certainly changed for the Australian star, who stunned in a luxurious Stella McCartney gown on the red carpet. 

Taking time out from her Kiss Me Once Tour, the  popstar oozed ethereal beauty in the floaty  frock.

The creamy cocktail dress looked dreamy on Kylie as its drop waist and layered hemline swished around her knees.

Made from a luminous silk, the subtle layers of uneven hem varied from soft pleats to rich satin-esque waves.

Discussing what she thinks makes British fashion so special, she said: 'I was so influenced when I first started coming to London and spending time here. 

'Anyone who is old enough to remember Garage on the King's Road - that's the place I would frequent. 

'I also loved Portobello Road Market - all those places were influential to me. I didn't know I would end up living here and working with these designers so celebrating tonight means a lot to me, an awful lot.

'Fashion has never waned, you want to work with people who are at the top of their game but there's always designers coming up who have something to offer and I love to be connected to that as much as possible and support them.'

To accessorise, Kylie found some height in the form of dazzling beige platforms with an open-toe and jewel-encrusted heel. 

From one singing superstar to another, Kylie rubbed shoulders with Spice Girl-turned-designer Victoria Beckham, posing with the British icon, who looked chic in a monochrome ensemble. 

Victoria, 40, took home the gong for Best Brand, beating Kylie's beloved Stella McCartney to the top spot.
