Disgraced trainer Mahmood Al Zarooni was banned for eight years for instigating the biggest drug scandal in British horseracing.

The 15 horses given anabolic steroids in his Godolphin stable in Newmarket have been banned from running for six months — effectively ending their season.

Three other employees — an assistant vet and two yard foremen — were also involved in administering Ethylestranol and Stanozolol to the horses, which are all owned by Sheik Mohammed, ruler of Dubai and the biggest racehorse owner in Britain.

Punished: Mahmood Al Zarooni left his hearing after being given an eight-year ban

The futures of the three stable staff remain under review by Godolphin.

Godolphin’s racing manager Simon 
Crisford said despite the massive embarrassment of an affair which has 
damaged the reputation of his boss, the Sheik would not be reducing his 
commitment to the sport.

But in a damning condemnation of Al 
Zarooni, who had sourced the performance-enhancing drugs in Dubai, where
he has admitted using them before, Crisford said he did not believe Al 
Zarooni’s explanation that he had not realised he was breaking the 
rules.

Scrum: 15 horses trained by Al Zarooni were also suspended on a damaging day for the sport

It is permitted to use steroids on horses in Dubai, providing 
they are not present in the system on raceday.

The 37-year-old, who gave the drugs 
to his horses on March 14, cut a forlorn figure as he left the BHA’s 
London base, his career in tatters.

Crisford, who said he had not 
considered resigning himself, admitted it will not be easy to restore 
Godolphin’s tarnished reputation. ‘Mr Zarooni said he had administered 
drugs before in Dubai, where it is legal providing the horses do not 
race,’ said Crisford.

‘He did it at the beginning of last 
winter. He did it on a small number of horses — less than 10 in 
pre-training — and assured me all the horses stayed in Dubai. Sheik 
Mohammed was completely unaware of this.

‘It goes without saying that this is a terrible situation for British racing and an absolutely awful  situation for Godolphin.

‘Mr Zarooni has acted with awful 
recklessness and he has caused tremendous damage not only to Godolphin 
but also British racing. For that, we are deeply sorry. It will take a 
very long time for Godolphin to regain the public’s confidence.

‘For Sheik Mohammed, racing is fun 
and there is no fun attached to this. I very much hope this does not 
leave a dark stain that he feels puts him a difficult position.'

Ethylestrenol and stanozolol boost muscle growth and fat loss - they are man-made anabolic steroids.

Stanozolol is more commonly taken by athletes and bodybuilders - either by injection or in tablet form.

Ethylestrenol is similar to nandralone and can aid recovery from injury.

He added: ‘He has tremendous passion for horses
and horseracing. I’m sure he will want to get everything right  as soon
as he can at Moulton Paddocks and continue his racing stables. But, in 
the short term, we have to re-structure.’

Crisford read a statement on Al 
Zarooni’s behalf which said: ‘First and foremost I would like to 
apologise to His Highness Sheik Mohammed as well as to all those 
involved with Godolphin and the public who follow British racing.

‘I accept that it was my 
responsibility to be aware of the rules regarding the use of prohibited 
substances in Britain. I can only apologise and repeat what I said in my
statement earlier in the week. I have made a catastrophic error.’

Bad news, boss: Godolphin owner Sheik Mohammed (left) with trainer Al Zarooni

Godolphin had already announced all horses in Al Zarooni’s care would not run until they had been dope tested and cleared.

At least a degree of independence was
introduced when it was announced the BHA would be involved in the 
testing procedures.But the haste of this inquiry — just three days after
the positive tests emerged — leaves an an uneasy feeling, one which BHA
chief Paul Bittar attempted to quell by suggesting the governing body 
would be rigorous in seeing Godolphin put their house in order.

Bittar said: ‘We are not saying this 
is the end of it, but it is the end of the beginning. We will also 
provide advice to Godolphin of necessary changes to its procedures and 
controls where appropriate — this will be supported by Godolphin’s own 
review. 

Scandal: 2012 St Leger winner Encke was also trained by Al Zarooni

‘Naturally, the BHA also consider the
wider issues raised by this matter and we will work to ascertain and 
collate all other relevant information including, where necessary, 
interviewing other employees and contractors of Godolphin.’

Whether this leads to further charges
remains to be seen but a sceptical wider world will take some 
convincing that this unsavoury incident was confined to four bad apples 
in the Godolphin empire.

The first chapter of this tawdry 
affair is closed and the villain of the piece, a man who had previously 
worked for a trainer who himself fell foul of the drugs testers, has 
exited.

The once rising star of the team will
probably be airbrushed from Godolphin history. His 192 winners a cause 
of embarrassment rather than pride.
