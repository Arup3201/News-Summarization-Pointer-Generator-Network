A 21-year-old woman who lied about getting raped on a Florida highway to cover for skipping work at her great-uncle's house has been charged.

Alexandra Anne Westover allegedly concocted an elaborate story about being sexually assaulted during rush hour, even describing to police what her attacker looked like, to avoid getting in trouble.

But after wasting 100 hours of authorities' time with her fake claims, the West Boca woman was charged with false report of a crime and perjury not during official proceedings.

Charged: Alexandra Westover, 21, has been charged with perjury after falsely claiming she was raped on a Florida highway to cover for skipping work

Concocted: Alexandra Westover told police the Hispanic-looking man pushed her into her car, ripped her dress and underpants and raped her

Orlando Sentinel reported Westover told deputies the attack happened about 8.30am Tuesday on Florida's Turnpike between the Palm Beach Gardens and Jupiter exits.

She said when she stopped to change a flat tire, a man in a white vehicle offered to help her.

Westover claimed the man asked her if she had a sharp object to pull off the hubcap.

When she opened the passenger door to check, the man pushed her in, ripped her dress and underwear and raped her.

The California native gave police a detailed description of her attacker.

She
 said he was a 
heavy-set, 5-foot-10, 40-something Hispanic man with salt and pepper 
hair, green eyes and bushy eyebrows.

He wore dark blue work pants and a 
light blue and short-sleeved shirt with yellow stitching on it, and drove a
 white truck with a black rack.

Orlando Sentinel reported the young woman showed a deputy the route she supposedly took, where she pulled over and how she
 was battered, the day after her attack.

However, Florida Highway Patrol troopers found 
no video footage of her vehicle on the Turnpike from northern Florida 
all the way to the Keys.

After the Sheriff's Office put out her account calling for witnesses, Westover's father called the deputy and said his daughter fabricated the tale.

She later confessed to the deputy she lied because she was scared about getting in trouble for missing work at a relative's house. 

According to WPTV.com, the sheriff's office said detectives, Florida Highway Patrol troopers and the Palm Beach County State Attorneyâ€™s Office Special Victims Unit spent more than 100 hundred hours  investigating the sexual assault case.

Advocates for sexual assault victims say that false allegations harm true victims by stopping people from reporting actual assaults.
