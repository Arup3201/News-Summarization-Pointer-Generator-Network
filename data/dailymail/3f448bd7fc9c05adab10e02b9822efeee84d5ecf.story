A van driver who was speeding and under the influence of drugs when she hit and killed a retired doctor mowing her lawn has been sentenced to three to nine years in prison.

Kayla Gerdes, 20, was high on cannabis and prescription drugs when she lost control of her van in Hempstead, New York, at 9.40am on April 20, 2010.

Then 18, she mounted a curb and careered across a lawn before ploughing into a house, killing Dr Rebecca Twine-Wright, 69.

Gerdes pleaded guilty in April to manslaughter, driving while high on drugs and several other charges.

Nassau County Court Judge John L Case said her plea spared the victim's family the ordeal of a trial. She had faced up to 59 years in prison.

Gerdes had a stolen prescription pad and over 50 painkillers, including  Xanax and Oxycodone, when she was arrested.

Federal charges are pending against pharmacist Lutful Chowdhury, who is accused of illegally filling prescriptions for painkillers.

Following her arrest, the court heard Gerdes told police: 'I don't feel bad, she was old.'

District Attorney Kathleen Rice told the hearing: 'Kayla Gerdes' actions before, during, and after the crash prove that she cared more about her pills than the innocent woman she had just struck and killed.

'This was a senseless tragedy that further underscores the perils of prescription drug abuse.'

Before she was sentenced yesterday, Gerdes turned to Dr Twine-Wright's son in court and apologised.

She said: 'I want you to know that from the bottom of my heart I am so sorry. Not a day goes by that I don’t think about your mother.

'I've been portrayed as a cold person, there is no way that I would ever minimise what happened. The pain I feel as a result of what happened will be a pain that never leaves me.

'I want you to know that this really was an accident. This is a horrific tragedy that I will have to live with for the rest of my life.'

Chauncey Twine, 33, turned his back on Gerdes during her apology.

Speaking outside court, he criticised the length of Gerdes' sentence.

He told CBS New York: 'My family is extremely disappointed with the sentence given her utter reckless disregard for my mother's life and overall recklessness.'

Mr Twine said he will petition the parole board to campaign for Gerdes to serve the full nine years of her sentence.
