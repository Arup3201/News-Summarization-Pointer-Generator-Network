These stunning images show natural waterfall landscapes transformed into vibrant rainbows of colour.

The other-worldy pictures are created by clever use of long exposure photography and glow sticks floating through water.

The Neon Luminance series is the brainchild of Sean Lenz, 19, and Kristoffer Abildgaard, 20, a photography duo based in California.

Photographers Sean Lenz and Kristoffer Abildgaard used glow sticks to illuminate the natural scenery of waterfalls in northern California to give them an eerie glow

Somewhere over the rainbow: Long exposure photography was used to capture the results of glow sticks floating through waterfalls in the U.S.

Northern lights: The Neon Luminance series was created by young photographers Sean Lenz and Kristoffer Abildgaard, aged just 19 and 20 in the north of California

Mr Abildgaard, originally from 
Copenhagen, explains: ‘This project came from months of refining a 
simple idea that finally turned into a concept worthy of using for an 
entire series.

’We were both fascinated by 
artificial light such as glow sticks, lasers, flares, and being big on 
landscape photography we tied them together in hopes of creating 
something that we had never seen before.

The photographers would not fully disclose how they achieved the haunting images such as this ripple effect in the Neon Luminance collection

Sean Lenz and Kristoffer Abildgaard used exposures varying from 30 seconds to seven minutes to create the effects

’Although we are not giving out the 
details as to how we did everything in the images we will disclose that 
they are long exposures taken between 30s and 7m of different landscapes
 where one person is standing at the drop point, strategically placing 
glow sticks in the right areas to flow into the frame of the image, 
while the other person is manning the camera and catching the glow 
sticks as they leave the frame.

The
 duo say they are so pleased with the results they wish to expand the 
idea of bringing artificial colour to natural landscapes.

’Although
 this series was meant to focus mostly on glow sticks in waterfalls, we 
are exploring the idea of creating artificially lit landscapes in 
general as well, such as mountains, lakes, tree lines, grass fields and 
caves,’ Mr Abildgaard added.

Kristoffer Abildgaard said he and Sean Lenz were considering photographing other artificially lit landscapes such as mountains, lakes, tree lines, grass fields and caves
