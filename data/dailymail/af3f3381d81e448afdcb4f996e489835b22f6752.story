North Korea has refused to deny claims that it is behind a cyber attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment that has resulted in five of the company's movies being illegally shared online. 

A spokesperson for the country would only say 'wait and
see' when asked on Monday if Pyongyang was involved in the attack on Sony just a month before its planned
release of a movie about a plot to kill the reclusive state's
leader, Kim Jong Un.

'The hostile forces are relating everything to the DPRK
(North Korea). I kindly advise you to just wait and see,' a
spokesman for North Korea's U.N. mission.

A North Korean spokesperson said 'wait and see' on Monday when asked if Pyongyang was involved in the attack on Sony just a month before its planned release of The Interview, staring James Franco and Seth Rogan

The Interview features Randall Park, above, as Kim Jong Un and is a comedy about an attempt to assassinate him

North Korea routinely refers to the United States and South
Korea as hostile forces. 

Sony Pictures' computer system went down last Monday after the cyber attack.

Before
screens went dark, they displayed a red skull and the phrase
'Hacked By #GOP,' which reportedly stands for Guardians of
Peace, the Los Angeles Times said. 

The hackers also warned they
would release 'secrets' stolen from Sony.

Technology news site Re/code reported that Sony and security
consultants were investigating whether someone acting on behalf
of North Korea, possibly from China, was responsible. 

A source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Saturday
that Sony Pictures was investigating every possibility, adding
that no link to North Korea has been uncovered.

North Korea complained to the United Nations in June about
the film starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, accusing the
United States of sponsoring terrorism and committing an act of
war by allowing production of the movie.

The Interview is due to be released on December 25 in the United States and Canada. It is a comedy about a CIA attempt to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

The Pyongyang government denounced the film as 'undisguised sponsoring of terrorism, as well as an act of war' in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. 

'I personally don't care if (the movie's) disrespectful to
Kim because he's evil. But that's not the intent,' Rogen posted
on Twitter on Sunday. 

'North Korea has produced tons of
propaganda films that portray America's destruction.'

In the action-comedy The Interview, Franco and  Rogen attempt to assassinate Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The movie is scheduled for release on Christmas Day

In addition to Annie, starring Jamie Foxx, which is due to hit theaters on December 19, Brad Pitt's critically acclaimed World War Two movie, Fury, is also being openly traded and downloaded online.

By Sunday morning, Fury, which is still playing in theaters, had been downloaded 1.2 million times and Annie had been downloaded 206,000 times from unique IP addresses, according to Variety.

Other Sony movies being downloaded include Mr. Turner, Still Alice and To Write Love on Her Arms.

Sony has hired FireEye Inc's Mandiant forensics unit to clean up the massive cyber attack that knocked out the studio's computer network nearly a week ago. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation is also investigating the incident.

Technicians are making headway in repairing damage caused by the attack and expect to have the email systems back online on Monday, an unnamed source told Reuters.

Sony executives have declined to comment on the scope of the attack, though emails have been bouncing back with messages asking senders to call employees because the system was 'experiencing a disruption.' 

Mandiant is an incident response firm that helps victims of breaches identify the extent of attacks, clean up networks and restore systems. The firm has handled some of the largest breaches uncovered to date, including the 2013 holiday attack on Target Corp.
