From working out with weights to catching a few rays or reading the newspaper over dinner - these animals certainly seem to have learnt a thing or two from their owners. 

The talented pets have seemingly decided to try out a range of everyday activities, usually reserved only for humans, as they pose to have their picture taken.

Russian photographer Svetlana Valyiskaya posed up the common pets in everyday situations to create this series of cute images.

Ms Valyiskaya, 27, from St Petersburg, first started taking pictures of animals following a long day at the office.

She said: 'I had just bought my first camera and so I decided to practice on my cat Vasilisa, she was my first photo model.

'I really love animals, they are loyal, faithful and true and always interesting to work with - plus they never criticise the photographs afterwards.

'I love to devise and make costumes, dresses, hats, shirts and jackets. They might not keep them on very long so you have to be quick to get the picture.

'I have many ideas that I want to bring to life but to get the animals to pose for pictures is difficult, each animal has an exclusive nature and temper.

'Usually taking just one photo can take a lot of time but it is very exciting and fascinating.
