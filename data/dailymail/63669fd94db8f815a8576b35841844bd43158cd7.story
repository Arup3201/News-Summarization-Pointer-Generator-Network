All eyes are on Arsenal on Wednesday night as the Gunners look to progress to the Champions League group stages yet again.

Standing in their way at the Emirates Stadium will be Besiktas, who are by no means out of the tie after a 0-0 in the first leg in Turkey.

We all know about former Newcastle and Chelsea striker Demba Ba, but here Sportsmail looks at three other stars who could trouble the Gunners.

Star man: Demba Ba is an obvious threat for Besiktas against Arsenal on Wednesday night

Worry: But who else could trouble Arsene Wenger's side as they look to progress to the group stage?

Oguzhan Ozyakup

Position Central midfielder

Age 21

Former clubs AZ, Arsenal

Apart from Ba, Ozyakup was Besiktas' most dangerous player in the first leg. Operating in the hole just behind the striker, the youngster picked passes intelligently and found space to worry Mikel Arteta. Looking at his technical style, its no wonder the Turkish-born playmaker used to ply his trade in North London.

Ozyakup came through the ranks under Arsene Wenger, but managed just one Capital One Cup substitute appearance with the Gunners well stocked in his position.

Wenger allowed him to jump ship, and admitted he was happy to see the youngster progress.

Talent: 21-year-old Oguzhan Ozyakup was impressive in the first leg, avoiding Aaron Ramsey who was sent off

'He was educated by us and we saw that he had top quality and technically he is very good,' Wenger told the club website. 'Physically he can run all day, he has very good stamina and a good final pass.

'I always thought he could make a career but at our club he had big competition in front of him and that is why we let him go.

'It is good to see he has made it to the top level and is now an important player in Turkey.'

Back again: Ozyakup is a former youth product at Arsenal, and will be looking to haunt the Gunners

Olcay Sahan

Position Winger

Age 26

Former clubs Borussia Monchengladbach, Duisberg, Kaiserslauten

After paving a career for himself in Germany, the place of his birth, Sahan has impressed at Besiktas since his move in 2012. A hard working left-winger, who has a decent turn of pace, he has since received call ups to the Turkish national team.

Tracked Mathieu Debuchy well in the first leg, only once or twice letting the energetic Frenchman out of his sights. Also capable of playing further in-field.

Unlucky: Olcay Sahan was dangerous in the first leg on the left wing

Ramon Motta

Position Left back

Age 26

Former clubs Internacional, Vasco de Gama, Corinthians

Your typical Brazilian full back. Motta bombed forward in the first leg, often looking to unleash a shot towards goal with his left foot.

Motta impressed on a loan deal last season, so much so he was given a permanent contract, but his attacking prowess can also turn into a defensive liability.

In the first-especially, Alexis Sanchez exploited the space on the right-hand side Motta left vacant, and whoever plays there for Arsenal on Wednesday night will be looking to do the same thing.

Dangerous: Ramon Motta was impressive going forward from left back, but there will be space to exploit

Remember him? 

Kerim Frei, 21

The former Fulham wonderkid shot to fame in West London with several impressive displays, including a man-of-the-match performance against local rivals Chelsea.

Fell out of favour under Martin Jol, though, and was eventually sold to Besiktas for around £2million via a loan spell at Cardiff. Of Austrian descent but has now played four times for Turkey.
