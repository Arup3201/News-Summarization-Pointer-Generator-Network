Suzanne Downer, 61, suffered from high blood pressure that doesn't respond to medication

Around 500,000 people suffer from high blood pressure that doesn't respond to medication. New research has shown that an implant in the leg can help them. Suzanne Downer, 61, a teacher from Welling, Kent, was one of the first in the UK to undergo the procedure, as she tells OONA MASHTA.

THE PATIENT

When I was pregnant with my only child, Sophie, 28 years ago, I suffered from pre-eclampsia, a condition which caused me to have very high blood pressure.

At its highest it was 220/120 (a healthy reading is 140/90). I had an emergency caesarean at eight months because my blood pressure was so high it could have triggered a stroke.

Sophie was healthy, but I was in hospital for three weeks because my blood pressure did not go down. I was put on high doses of medication and warned that a second baby could be dangerous as my pre-eclampsia could worsen next time.

Ever since, I've visited my GP every three months to check my blood pressure and medication.

But despite different pills and combinations, my blood pressure has remained at around 180/100. I've tried to cut it by staying a healthy weight, avoiding adding salt to food, and exercising frequently. Doctors said it was probably hereditary - my grandfather died of a stroke at 29, and my uncle at 65.

Three years ago, things got worse. I spent a week with constant pins and needles in my arms and my blood pressure went as high as 220/110. I was immediately sent to A&E - I had to stay in hospital for observation for 30 hours as doctors feared I was having a heart attack.

Then I was referred to a cardiologist. I was on five different blood pressure drugs, with side-effects, including excruciating migraines that lasted up to three days. In 2012 I was referred to Dr Mel Lobo, a hypertension specialist. Tests showed an enlarged heart muscle - a sign it's damaged. My high blood pressure meant my heart had to work harder to pump blood round my body.

Dr Lobo gave me a liquid medication called nifedipine, which helped a bit, but when he said there was a mechanical solution I was keen to try it. He said it would involve having a small metal clip implanted in my thigh - it would join a vein and an artery together, so some blood from the artery could leak into the vein, reducing my blood pressure. I would be part of a clinical trial.

I had the hour-long procedure in June 2013. First I had local anaesthetic around my groin and they inserted a thin hollow tube into an artery leading to my heart to monitor my blood pressure. Then they inserted the implant in my right thigh.

On the operating table my blood pressure dropped to 120/70. It was painful despite the anaesthetic and my right leg was bruised and swollen - I was off work for six weeks.

My blood pressure is now around 140/70, slightly raised but a great improvement.

I still take some medication, including nifedipine, but it's nothing compared with the cocktail of drugs I used to have. Tests have shown my enlarged heart muscle is starting to heal itself.

I no longer live in fear of a heart attack or stroke, or have debilitating side-effects from the drugs. It's a huge relief.

THE SPECIALIST

Number of people in the UK believed to have undiagnosed high blood pressure 

Dr Mel Lobo is director of the hypertension clinic at Barts Health NHS Trust in London.

We need pressure to push blood from the heart to the arteries and the major organs, then back to the heart again. The problem is if your blood pressure is high - which affects more than 15 million Britons - the heart has to work harder to pump blood, which weakens it.

Increased pressure can also damage artery walls, and can cause a blockage, leading to a stroke or a heart attack.

In a blood pressure reading, the top number (systolic pressure) is the pressure exerted when the heart contracts and pushes blood around the body.

The lower number (diastolic pressure) refers to when the heart relaxes between beats. A healthy reading is around 120/80 but high blood pressure is anything above 140/90.

She still takes some medication but it's nothing compared with the cocktail of drugs she used to

We try to treat hypertension with lifestyle changes, such as losing weight, reducing alcohol and salt. But high blood pressure can be hereditary, so these may not have an effect.

Some patients need medication for the rest of their life. It can include ACE inhibitors, which relax blood vessels, and beta-blockers, which make the heart beat more slowly. Calcium channel blockers widen arteries, and diuretics flush excess water and salt

But all have potential side-effects - ACE inhibitors can trigger a cough, diuretics can lead to erectile dysfunction. And in about 500,000 patients, conventional medical therapy fails to control high blood pressure.

There are now alternative, device-based treatments for helping these patients bring down their blood pressure.

One is the Coupler device, a paper clip-sized implant inserted in the upper thigh under local anaesthetic. It affects how blood circulates round the body - we effectively transfer blood from a major artery into a major vein, which reduces systolic blood pressure. Once implanted, the Coupler lowers blood pressure by more than 15 per cent and this reduction seems to be long lasting.

In a clinical trial of 83 patients, 44 patients were given the device. They experienced significant, lasting reduction in blood pressure, according to a study published last month in the Lancet.

The procedure involves making a 2mm incision in the groin and inserting thin tubes into two key blood vessels, the femoral artery and vein.

We put a guide wire in to pierce another vein and artery higher in the groin. We then insert the nickel titanium alloy implant; this joins these two vessels together and keeps this passageway open. When blood pressure in the artery becomes dangerously high, small amounts of pressurised blood flows safely from the artery into the vein, reducing blood pressure.

The effect is immediate for some, for others it takes a few hours. The procedure is reversible but has not been needed so far.

It does have a potential side-effect. Most patients developed leg swelling - the implant can narrow the artery, causing an increase in blood flow in the vein above it, which can lead to swelling. This is often rectifiable with diuretic medication to flush water from the body.

However, 29 per cent of patients need a stent - a small tube - inserted in the narrowed arteries to treat the problem.

ANY DRAWBACKS?

'The implant is relatively simple to insert, and reversible, the downside is that you undergo a procedure,' says Tom MacDonald, president of the British Hypertension Society and professor of clinical pharmacology at the University of Dundee.

'Some side-effects we know - problems at the insertion site and leg swelling - but some are still unknown, as relatively few people have been treated this way.

'More research could let us help patients with hard-to-control hypertension. But more study is needed before it can be recommended for routine NHS use.'
