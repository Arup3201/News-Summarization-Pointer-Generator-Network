As any woman with less-than-perfect pins will tell you, black tights are one of the few blessings of winter.

When it comes to flabby arms however, it's usually been a case of grin and bare them - or cover up with a cardigan.

Not this Christmas party season.

Celebrity victim: Women have had to grin and bear flabby arms until now. Even super-fit Madonna has a hint of bingo wings

Spanx for arms? M&S's new Flatter Me Armwear uses 'light control' lace to 'smooth, shape and sculpt' disobedient arm wobble

Marks and Spencer claims to have come up with the perfect solution to bingo wings - a crop top dubbed as 'Spanx for the arms'.

Available as a body or a crop top - and following on from the Flatter Me bra and knicker - Flatter Me Armwear is a long- or three-quarter-sleeved solution to strappy party dresses.

Worn beneath the outfit but over the bra, the light-control fabric promises to gently sculpt arms and 'give a smooth and firm silhouette while the intricate lace adds a touch of glamour'.

Soozie Jenkinson, Head of Design for 
Lingerie at M&S says: 'Sleeveless dresses can be tricky to wear for 
many women who are conscious of bearing their upper arms.

'Now you don't have to restrict your 
dress choice as our Flatter Me Armwear, the newest item in our shaping 
solutions wardrobe, allows women to wear sleeveless dresses with style 
and confidence.'

Paschal 
Little, Head of Lingerie Innovation at M&S says: 'Our Flatter Me 
Armwear is designed with a beautifully delicate lace which has light 
shaping properties that will gently smooth and shape your arms for a 
sleek look with a bra fastening under the bust for a secure and snug 
fit.'

The
Flatter Me Armwear is £22.50 while the body, which comes with a 
flattening tummy panel, is priced at £27.99, and both are available online.
