These astonishing pictures show how Chetham Library in Manchester, where Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels famously began their work on the Communist Manifesto, has remained largely unchanged since they first sat down together in 1845. 

It's been a closed book, but these pictures reveal how time has stood still in the of the world’s oldest and most unique libraries.

These astonishing pictures show how Chetham Library in Manchester has remained largely unchanged in hundreds of years

Chetham's Library in the heart of Manchester city centre was founded in 1653 and is the oldest public library in the English-speaking world

 The library boasts more than 100,000 volumes of printed books (some pictured) of which 60,000 were published before 1851

 The library is completely free to visit and is one of the city's hidden gems, boasting most of its original features - like these exposed beams

But you could walk past Chetham’s library, in the heart of Manchester city centre, in the blink of an eye and be none the wiser about the incredible treasures tucked away inside.

Amid the hustle and bustle near the National Football Museum and Manchester Cathedral, the 17th Century library is tucked away from view, snuggled next to the famous Chetham’s School of Music.

But it is completely free to visit and is arguably one of the city’s, if not the country’s, greatest hidden gems.

Radical German Marx met up with his fellow German, the industrialist Friedrich Engels, to formulate their political ideas and the desk where the pair worked in 1845 remains on display.

But the library is not stuck in Medieval times - its collections encompass everything from a substantial archive about Belle Vue Zoo

Among the more bizarre items are the belongings of John Dee, an occultist and former warden of the college who believed in angel summoning

When it was first founded the building which houses the library was the second largest building in the medieval town of Manchester

The entire collection at Chetham's Library has been designated as one of national and international importance and has many rare books

Founded in 1653 following the death of Humphrey Chetham, the site is Britain’s oldest public reference library.

Its dark wooden shelves and atmospheric wooden beams bear more than a passing resemblance to Hogwarts and contain a trove of treasures, ranging from a rare first version of John Milton’s epic poem Paradise Lost to the death mask of clergyman Thomas Whitaker.

Among the most bizarre items are personal belongings of self-proclaimed magician John Dee, an occultist and former warden of Manchester College who believed in angel summoning and perpetual motion.

But the library is not stuck in Medieval times - and its collections encompass everything from a substantial archive about Belle Vue Zoo to one of the world’s foremost collections of Northern Soul paraphernalia.

As well as boasting original features, it has a number of treasures including a rare first version of John Milton’s epic poem Paradise Lost

The library began acquiring books in  1655 and has been adding to it ever since - it even boasts a collection of Northern Soul paraphernalia

As well as early printed books, the collections include a wealth of manuscript diaries, letters, deeds, prints, paintings and glass lantern slides

The library was established under the will of Humphrey Chetham, a prosperous Manchester textile merchant, banker and landowner

The building that houses Chetham's is even older than the foundation of the Library - it was built in 1421 to accommodate a college of priests

The building which still boasts many original features remains one of the most complete medieval complexes to survive in the north west

When it was founded the library acquired a major collection of books and manuscripts so it would rival the libraries of Oxford and Cambridge

Today the library continues to expand its collection and now specialises in the history and topography of Greater Manchester and Lancashire

Chetham's has been in continuous use as a free public library for over 350 years and is also a  popular tourist destination in the city

The beautiful old sandstone buildings, together with the magnificent Library interior, create a unique atmosphere for readers and visitors alike

The library is run as an independent charity and remains open to readers and visitors completely free of charge to this day
