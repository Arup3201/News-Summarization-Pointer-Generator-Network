A father who cradled his dead daughter in his arms after a car crash said her killer should have been given a life sentence.

Annie Cochrane, 14, suffered fatal head injuries and died at the scene when the Rover 25 car in which she was a passenger hit a tree.

Driver Michael Partington, 19, was sentenced on Friday to four-and-a-half years in a Young Offenders' Institution after he admitted causing death by dangerous driving.

Devastating: Michael Partington killed girlfriend Annie Cochrane after crashing his car into a tree while driving 'like a madman' along a country lane in Wigan

But Annie's father, Andrew, said his punishment was not harsh enough.

The 46-year-old suffered a heart attack from shock and grief after he went to the scene of the crash and got into the car to hold his daughter.

He said: 'We expected him to get a similar sentence, but we did not expect him to be getting out in two-and-a-half years for good behaviour.

'I am old-fashioned and think taking a life should mean life. After the court case, we went up to see Annie at her grave and told her what Partington got.'

Liverpool Crown Court heard that Partington, of Westhoughton, Bolton, had driven like a 'madman' after a dispute with his younger brother over drugs.

He was heard to say: 'I am going to explode either through emotion or anger' before driving off with his wheels spinning.

Scene of tragedy: Partington lost control on a bend in School Lane, Wigan, and crashed into a tree. He fled the area, but returned later

He reached speeds of 70mph on an unmarked, unadopted 20mph road, causing his passengers to fly off their seats while hitting speed bumps.

After ignoring his passengers' screams to slow down, he lost control on a bend and ploughed through a verge and struck a tree.

He fled the scene and threatened to kill himself, but later returned.

The crash happened at 1.50am on Sunday, February 13, in School Lane, Wigan.

Cabinet maker Mr Cochrane, of Horwich, said: 'When I got to the scene, I got to the car and was holding her in my arms. She was already dead but I didn't know.

'When I was told she was dead at Wigan Hospital, I had a heart attack, but discharged myself because I knew my son, Adam, needed me. I am on tablets to help me sleep now.

'We talk about Annie all of the time. She wasn't just my daughter, she was my best friend.'

Partington's passengers Adam Clarke, 18, Adam Jack King, 17, and a 15-year-old girl who cannot be named for legal reasons, were also injured and have been left with post-traumatic stress and flashbacks.

Brian McKenna, mitigating, said his client suffers from severe depression and anxiety and has lost a person close to him through his actions.

Sentencing Partington, Judge Mark Brown said: 'It is apparent you were driving like a mad man at a very fast speed and completely ignoring your passengers.

'If you hadn't been driving in this way then Annie would have been alive today. It is clear the death had a devastating impact on her family and friends.'
