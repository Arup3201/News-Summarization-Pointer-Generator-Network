Sorted: The ultimate present for the person who has everything is a book about nothing

What Christmas present do you choose for the person who has everything? A book of nothing, of course.

Scientists have joined together to write a book about why nothing is the key to understanding absolutely everything.

From absolute zero and the power of placebos, to light bulbs, vacuums, dark energy, ‘bed rest’ and the birth of time, the book explores different aspects of the concept of nothing.

A collection of 25 essays by writers from New Scientist magazine, the book, Nothing, is already flying off the shelves.

The unlikely literary hit stands at No.4 in the Sunday Times paperback non-fiction bestseller list ahead of the autobiographies of Miranda Hart, the comedian, and the footballer Zlatan Ibrahimovic.

The book tackles questions such as, why do some animals spend all day doing nothing? And what happens in our brain when we try to think about nothing?

For centuries, scientists have known that without nothing we would be precisely nowhere.

Jeremy Webb, the book’s editor, told the Sunday Times: ‘It turns out that nothing is a really valuable thing and when scientists ask questions about nothing they come up with some really intriguing answers, that’s what the book is all about.

‘Without nothing we’d be precisely nowhere.’

He added: ‘Nothing has been a topic of discussion for more than 2,000 years: the ancient Greeks had a lively disagreement about it.’

Hit: The unlikely chart-topper is set to be a best-seller for presents over the Christmas period

For example, the book explores animals who appear to spend most of their time doing nothing.

It turns out they are not taking it as easy as one would assume. Animals such as the Burmese python and the sloth spend their weeks barely moving but their metabolisms are actually working at a furious rate.

The python’s digestion pushes its metabolic rate up to the equivalent of a horse at full gallop.
