This dramatic footage captured the moment a stuntman leapt from a bridge onto a speeding train below - and miraculously survived.

In the 43-second clip, the daredevil, known as Mister Puma, is seen lying face-down on a rooftop before springing to his feet, crouching and preparing to jump.

As a train exits  the tunnel underneath at speed, the 38-year-old full-time stuntman takes a brief run-up before throwing himself off the roof and landing on top of the speeding train.

Mister Puma, pictured,  said he intends repeating his death-defying stunt on the Paris Metro in the near future

The stuntman lay prone over the exit of the tunnel before leaping onto the roof of the speeding train

While he initially lands on his feet, the speed of the train throws him backwards. 

The video then cuts to a busy street, where the stuntman is seen jogging towards the camera, before leaping upwards and punching the air, smiling, and saluting the camera.

The stunt took place a week ago in Paris, and Mister Puma stayed on top of the train until the next station.

He said: 'It did not exactly go to plan but I am still alive.

'There are still some things to improve, it has to be done again.' 

Parisian Mister Puma told how he started stunts, acrobatics and martial arts when he was 16, trained by expert Sylvain Durand.

He planned this stunt for 'several months', adding: 'I knew I could do it and I took all the risks into consideration.

'So the only real risk was to make sure not to arrive directly between the wagons due to the edge. 

'Sometimes I need to prove to myself I can do it.

'Before making a challenge, I have a lot of fear, I see myself falling and die in several ways.

'But I know that in reality it will be much less scary. And if I do not feel it, I do not do it.

'Then comes the satisfaction of having accomplished and overcome the fears.

'Some people see me crazy but I'm a stuntman, so I do stunts.'

Mister Puma - who got his name from the 'iconic figure that represents his style' due to the resemblance to a Puma when he jumps, added: 'My next challenge? A holiday.'

The footage was filmed by Mister Puma's friend Aurore Tome along with Michel Girard.

Mister Puma said he spent several months planning the stunt even though he thought he might die 

Mister Puma's Facebook profile describes him as an 'Animal Urbain...' who is 'passionate about martial arts', having taken up karate aged 15 and training in martial arts and acrobatics.

The video was posted on his official Facebook page, which has more than 1,100 likes, where his cover photo shows the moment he leapt onto the train, and his profile picture appears to show him perched between train carriages with his arms folded, with the train track visible below.

Other pictures on his Facebook profile show Mister Puma appearing to free-run across rooftops.

He can also be seen performing gymnastics - holding himself vertically upright with just his arms as he grips onto railings on the edge of buildings.
