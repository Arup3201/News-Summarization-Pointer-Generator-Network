Louis van Gaal is on the verge of being able to send out his dream starting XI for Manchester United, after putting an almost completely fit side through training on Friday morning.

And, with the United manager insisting results prove his team is currently the best in the Premier League, that spells trouble for sides hoping to pip the Reds to a Champions League spot.

United have lost just one of their last 19 games in all competitions, reaching the quarter-finals of the FA Cup and drastically improving their chances of a top-four finish.

On Saturday they visit Swansea - who ruined van Gaal's debut as United manager by winning 2-1 at Old Trafford on the opening day of the season.

But with van Gaal denied just one injured first team star at the Liberty Stadium tomorrow, the Dutchman knows he is on the brink of having a full-strength squad for the closing stages of the campaign.

Van Gaal said: 'We are very close to that stage. In the first four months I started only to select from out of the fit players.

'And, as you know, I always had 10 or 11 players injured.

'Now, the last month, I only have one or two players and now only Michael Carrick is injured so that's a big difference.

'That's also because of the way of training, also the players had to adapt to the way of training, and now that's complete. That's the big difference with the beginning of the season.'

Van Gaal has had his critics in his first season in charge of the club but has nevertheless presided over a remarkable upturn in fortunes.

And he believes that his first team players have now got over the difficulties of transitioning to a new management style and have bought into his footballing philosophy.

Van Gaal said: 'Now I believe every player knows the philosophy of me and my staff.

'You can see that in the team spirit of the team, it's unbelievable.

The likes of Angel di Maria and Falcao have arrived at Old Trafford since the opening day defeat and United's squad is now packed with quality

Van Gaal insists the players have now taken on his philosophy, and are playing with confidence in their climb up the league

'The confidence is the same now as then because we had just come back from the United States where we had won everything against big clubs.

'But now, when you look at the scores of the last 15 or 20 matches, we are the best team in the Premier League so I think the confidence is also high.

'The difference with the beginning of the season is my players know and have experienced much more playing in our system with our philosophy.'

Van Gaal has to decide whether to recall Robin van Persie for the trip to Swansea at the expense of Radamel Falcao although he has the option of using Marouane Fellaini up front.
