They were kicked out of office at the last election in the wave of public fury over the MPs’ expenses system.

But several former Labour and Lib Dem MPs have been re-selected by their parties to stand in next year’s poll.

Dubbed ‘re-treads’, the seven former Labour MPs and two former Lib Dem members will be back on the ballot paper on May 7.

They include MPs caught claiming thousands for second homes in London despite their main residence being only a short distance from Parliament. Others ‘flipped’ their second homes so they could claim more for renovating or furnishing the second property. 

All were entitled to payoffs worth tens of thousands of pounds when they left the Commons.

Critics said voters should be made fully aware of the expenses past of the former MPs so they could make up their minds about whether they should vote for them next year.

Andy Silvester, Campaign Manager at the Taxpayers’ Alliance said: ‘You’d expect any campaign to mention what these individuals claimed when they last enjoyed the privileges of Parliament.’

Martin Bell, the anti-sleaze campaigner and former independent MP, said voters would ‘think about why they lost their seats in the first place’.

‘Obviously they are entitled to seek re-election,’ he said. ‘It will be up to the voters to make the decision. Their expenses records are out in the open.’

The ‘re-tread’ MPs all faced question marks about their expenses claims at the last election and were booted out of office.

Andrew Dismore was Labour MP for Hendon from 1997 until 2010. He claimed £34,000 for his second home, a flat in West London, which housed his girlfriend’s homeopathy surgery. He then ‘flipped’ his designated second home – saying the West London flat had become his main residence – and claimed another £31,000.

Joan Ryan became Labour MP for Enfield North in 1997. She spent thousands on repairs and decorations at her Enfield home before ‘flipping’ it to another property. She was ordered by officials to repay £5,000 in ‘over-claimed’ mortgage interest.

Dawn Butler was Labour MP for Brent Central from 2005 until 2010. Among expenses she claimed for her second home were a whirlpool bath in a bathroom suite that cost £2,308.

Paul Clark, the former Labour MP for Gillingham, claimed £1,200 a month in rent for his London flat before ‘flipping’ his second home and claiming mortgage interest on a house in Kent.

Mike O’Brien, the former Labour MP for North Warwickshire, claimed £17.49 for a carbon monoxide detector.

Former Labour MP for Selby John Grogan claimed £150 on English lessons for a Mongolian intern so he could understand his constituents’ Yorkshire accents.

Bob Blizzard, who was Labour MP for Waveney in Suffolk, hit the headlines for claiming 39p for a single paper clip in his expenses.

Julia Goldsworthy, who was Lib Dem MP for Falmouth and Camborne, claimed thousands of pounds on expensive furniture only days before the deadline for using up Commons allowances.

Richard Younger-Ross, who represented Teignbridge in Devon, repaid more than £4,300 on ‘luxury’ items that included £1,200 mirrors at his London flat.

A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘All our candidates are committed to upholding the highest standards in office. It was Labour in government who introduced tougher and more transparent reforms to MPs’ expenses.’

A Lib Dem spokesman said: ‘Julia and Richard are fierce local campaigners with a track record of delivering for their local areas. 

‘They have been selected by their local parties because of this record and their desire to build the stronger economy and fairer society Britain badly needs. 

MPs from all parties were criticised for their expenses and both Richard and Julia made full repayments for any errors they made.’

The Daily Mail is not aware of any Tory MPs who lost their seats in 2010 amid questions about their expenses who have been selected to fight next year. 

An analysis of the party’s published list of Prospective Parliamentary Candidates suggests none was previously an MP.
