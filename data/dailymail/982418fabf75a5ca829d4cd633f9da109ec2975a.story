Cadbury has ditched the all time classic chocolate Bournville in favour of foreign invader Toblerone in its Christmas tins of Heroes causing outrage among fans.

The move has been dubbed ‘unpatriotic’ by one of Britain’s top chocolate tasters Angus Kennedy, who considers the inclusion of the Swiss sweet an insult to fans of the nation’s favourite chocolate. 

American food giant Kraft took over Cadbury in 2010, despite fierce backlash from lovers of the iconic English confectionery brand - now under the umbrella of multinational group Mondelez International.

Anger: Chocolate fans are furious the classic Bournville has been replaced with Toblerones in Heroes tins

Chocoholics were worried the takeover would lead to a demise of the Birmingham-based firm.

And they fear their nightmares are beginning to come true with Toblerone being heralded as a special treat at the expense of Bournville, the home of Cadbury.

Kraft previously came under fire from British confectioners for cutting the size of the country’s favourite chocolate bar, Dairy Milk.

Despite it only being August, Cadbury has already launched its Christmas tins of Heroes, decorated with Santa hats, snow, tinsel and reindeer antlers.

Mr Kennedy, editor of Kennedy’s Confection magazine, said: 'Kraft couldn’t care less about Cadbury as a symbol of national pride.

'To replace Bourneville with Toblerone is unpatriotic.

'It’s like replacing the fish in fish and chips with mussels.

'To Kraft, its not about what the British care about any more or our heritage, it’s all about making money.

'If big companies think our heritage can make them money then they will buy into it.

'Cadbury fans have had a rough ride.

'I’m always pleasantly surprised to learn that there are still some left.

'But sadly many Cadbury fanatics have lost hope. This is just another nail in the coffin.

'The focus now is all about sales and any thing that can be done to increase profits will happen even at the expense of traditional sentiments.

'They ignore what their core customer base wants to chase new ones.

'Heroes is worth over £40 million and is a very successful brand.

'British chocolate - if we can call it that - has stiff competition now from Lindt and Fererro and many other new companies on the block.

'Traditional brands like Heroes need a boost as new creative chocolate marketing campaigns and team ups between different sweets are eating into their market share.

'They see Toblerone as a hero too. Whether heroic enough to do the job we will see.'

One angry chocolate lover, Anna Cook, said she couldn't believe Toblerone has been added to tins of Heroes.

'It’s not even a Cadbury chocolate bar.

'If I wanted a Toblerone, I would go out and buy one.

'But when I buy a tin of Heroes I expect it to be full of my favourite Cadbury treats.'

Feeling festive: Despite it only being August, Cadbury have already launched its Christmas tub of Heroes

The addition of Toblerone to Cadbury products is just the next in a line of collaborations between Cadbury favourites such as Dairy Milk with big name brands such as Oreo.

A spokesperson for Mondelez International said: 'Toblerone is a Christmas favourite which has been added to the Heroes assortment.

'The tub makes it clear that Toblerone is a guest unit within the Heroes mix.

Mondelez International will also stop delivering chocolate parcels to its 14,400 former workers at Christmas

'It has been well received by our customers.

'Not only has Mondelez International mixed different brands to make them even more popular, we have also mixed categories together such as the very successful Cadbury Dairy Milk with Oreo biscuit and we continue to look for new opportunities.'

Early this month it was announced that Mondelez International will stop delivering chocolate parcels to its 14,400 former workers at Christmas - ending a 20 year tradition.
