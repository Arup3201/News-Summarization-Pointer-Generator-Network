A London council has been been accused of 'cultural vandalism' over plans to sell off £13million of its giant collection of Ming and other Chinese dynasty antiques.

At least 24 of Croydon's Council's most expensive items, including tomb models and china dating back to the ninth century, could now be auctioned.

The borough says it cannot display much of its 230-piece collection - bequeathed by local businessman and collector Raymond Riesco in 1964 - because they cannot afford 'Louvre-style security'.

Historic: This stoneware narcissus bowl from the 14th century is among the items likely to be sold by Croydon Council, who hope it'll raise £13million in a move being called 'cultural vandalism'

Delicate: This perfectly preserved porcelain cake box from the Wanli period in China, made between 1573 and 1619, will also probably go to auction

Some of the collection, which spans from Neolithic times to the 19th century, has featured at other galleries and museums, including the British Museum.

Magical: This antique, a porcelain pilgrim bottle from the Xuande Period (1426 to 35), is also likely to be up for grabs for a small fortune

The items proposed for sale have been moved to a central London location for valuation.

The council said the sell-off had the backing of the Riesco family as long as the proceeds were spent on culture in the borough.

It plans to use the proceeds to help fund the refurbishment of Fairfield Halls, the 1962 concert hall in Croydon.

But the plans have angered some local historians and residents, with a petition calling on council leader councillor Mike Fisher to stop the sale reaching nearly 200 signatures in five days.

Oliver Lewis, who started the petition, said the sale would be 'cultural vandalism', adding: 'These pieces are a real asset to the borough and should be cherished for the benefit of all.

'Selling them off to chase a quick buck is short sighted.'

Sean Creighton, a local historian and archivist, said the threatened collection could have educational value as well as attracting visitors.

He added: 'The collection may not seem part of our heritage but it is, because Ming porcelain was very popular in 18th century Britain and Europe and English potters were inspired by it, launching our own fine china industry.'

A rival petition supporting the sale currently boasts 86 signatures. It was launched on Wednesday.

Valuable: This fine porcelain saucer from the Jiajing period, 1522 to 1566, is one of 24 items likely to go under the hammer

Well known: Some of Croydon's collection has been at the British Museum (pictured) but the council say they cannot afford the 'Louvre-style security' they need for it

Councillor Tim Pollard, the council's culture spokesman, said the items proposed for sale - which he claimed had never been exhibited in Croydon - were wasted as it could not afford to insure them for display.

He said: 'Individually they are all very valuable items, very small and very portable, so to a professional gang a very tempting target.

'In order to put the items we are talking about on display we would have to add Louvre-style security to the Riesco gallery - things like laser alarms - and that would cost hundreds of thousands of pounds.'

He added: 'What is the point of keeping some very valuable items in a crate in a vault? Isn't it better to use the money you've got tied up in that for something we can all access?'

The sale will be considered by the council's corporate services committee on July 24.
