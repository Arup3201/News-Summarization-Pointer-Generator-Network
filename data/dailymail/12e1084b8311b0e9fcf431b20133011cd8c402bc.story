President Barack Obama kicked off the spring season on Saturday with a weekend golf getaway in Florida at the resort where he once caused a stir by playing with Tiger Woods.

During his stay at the Floridian National Golf Club in Palm City, less than 50 miles up the coast from Palm Beach, Obama planned to be out of public view, with no official events scheduled.

First lady Michelle Obama and daughters Malia and Sasha are not on the trip.

Local media reports the 53-year-old will tee off with former NBA star Alonzo Mourning, former NFL star and sportscaster Ahmad Rashad and Cyrus Walker, a cousin of Obama's senior adviser, Valerie Jarrett, according toWPTV.

Two years ago, Obama played 18 holes at the Floridian with Woods and practiced with Woods' former swing coach. 

This time, the president's partners were expected to be a few friends who are his frequent golf guests.

Obama flew to the airport in Fort Pierce before making the short trip to Palm City.

Word of Obama's golf game with Woods in 2013 came initially from a professional sports journalist who was on the course and tweeted about it, even though the White House had prohibited the traveling press corps from observing Obama on the course.

Like last time, the White House arranged for the reporters covering the president to wait at a separate location on the property where Obama won't be visible. 

According to local paper TCPalm, Obama was also  expected to play the 18-hole course with Woods’ former coach instructor Butch Harmon.

Controversial: Two years ago, Obama caused a stir during a visit to the same Florida golf resort by closing the course off from the press. It was then revealed he was having private lessons with Tiger Woods

Previous administrations have allowed brief news media coverage during presidential rounds of golf. 

Obama's policy generally is not to allow reporters to observe him.  

He has made a few exceptions when he's golfed with prominent figures, including House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, former President Bill Clinton and the leaders of New Zealand and Malaysia.

The Federal Aviation Administration has issued flight restrictions in a ten-mile area over the Palm City area for the entire weekend. 

Obama planned to return to the White House on Sunday evening.
