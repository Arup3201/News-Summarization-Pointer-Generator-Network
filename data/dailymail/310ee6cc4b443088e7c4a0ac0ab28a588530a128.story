Labour would impose rent controls ‘without hesitation’ if it won the next election, its housing spokesman Jack Dromey has been secretly recorded saying.

His admission came eight days after Labour’s biggest paymaster the Unite union called for the party to adopt controls on what private landlords can charge.

It brought claims that Unite, where Mr Dromey was deputy general secretary until 2010, has ‘bought’ Labour policy.

Promises: Jack Dromey, pictured with his wife Harriet Harman, said that Labour would impose rent controls 'without hesitation' if it won in 2015

Rent controls have been tried by socialist governments, in particular, around the world but have been widely regarded as disastrous.

However Mr Dromey, MP for Birmingham Erdington and husband of Labour’s deputy leader Harriet Harman, said Labour wants to impose rent controls if it wins power in 2015.

Addressing a private Labour meeting last month, Mr Dromey admitted that it would be ‘difficult in the 21st century to make traditional rent controls work’ because it would lead to a ‘loss of supply’ of rental homes and ‘deter investment’ by landlords.

But he said: ‘Should you have a form of rent control to end ever-spiralling upward rent, particularly here in London, yes without hesitation, yes without hesitation.’

Suspicious words: Mr Dromey's words came just one week after his party's biggest contributors, Unite, had called for the party to adopt controls on private rents

Rent controls are seen as having led to the spread of slum dwellings under socialist regimes in Vietnam and Venezuela.

They deter landlords from renting out their properties or from decorating houses that are rented out, leaving tenants with dilapidated accommodation.

A minister in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in the 1980s said rent controls there led to poor housing standards and did more damage to Hanoi than American bombs.

In Venezuela, rent controls imposed in December 2012 have failed to combat rising inflation which hit 39.6 per cent in June.

In New York, rent controls are blamed for reducing the city’s housing supply. Varying degrees of control over rent operated on and off in Britain from the First World War until the 1980s.

Official figures show they contributed to the private rented sector shrinking from 55 per cent of households in 1939 to 8 per cent in the late 1980s.

Jack Dromey and his wife Harriet Harman own at least two large homes, including one in Herne Hill, South London.

But Labour has come under pressure from 
Unite, which has given the party £9.2million since Ed Miliband became 
leader, to adopt the plans.

On July 15 the union’s Twitter feed declared: ‘It’s time for Labour to be bold and commit to introduce rent control for private landlords who are profiteering.’

On July 23 Mr Dromey spoke out at an ‘affordable housing day’ organised by Brent London Borough Council.

He said Labour is ‘going through a whole range of options in terms of how you deliver more affordable and predictable rents’ and that the party is looking at ‘traditional rent controls that we once had in this country’.

Mr Dromey said an alternative would be to copy the ‘models in Continental Europe where you have longer-term tenancies and indexational rents’.

Tory MP Henry Smith said: ‘Labour’s reckless gamble with rent controls would take us back to the 1970s: higher rents, fewer houses, and refurbishment would fall off a cliff. Clearly, Unite are buying Labour’s policy on rent controls.’

A spokesman for Mr Dromey said: ‘We have made it clear we are not talking about traditional rent controls, but a new model that works for both landlords and tenants.’
