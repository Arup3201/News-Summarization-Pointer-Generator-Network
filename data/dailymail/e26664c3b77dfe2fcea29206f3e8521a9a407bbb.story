While Nick Kyrgios was smashing his way into the quarter-finals of the Australian Open against Italy's Andreas Seppi on Sunday, his mother was pacing the corridors of the Hisense Arena, too nervous to watch.

Despite having arrived eight hours early to reserve front row seats for Nick's 25 schoolmates at the non-ticketed event, just 45 minutes into the game Norlaila Kyrgios walked out, unable to witness the outcome of the match.

Over three hours later she was crying with joy in a corner of the arena, after roars from the crowd signified her son's triumph on the court.

While Nick Kyrgios was smashing his way into the quarter-finals of the Australian Open against Italy's Andreas Seppi on Sunday, his mother was pacing the corridors of the Hisense Arena, too nervous to watch

Speaking to the Canberra Times, Norlaila said she fears she is 'jinxing' her 19-year-old son when she watches his matches, preferring to pace the corridors striking up conversation with passer-bys to take her mind off the game.  

'If there's a possibility of him winning, I can't stand it. I'm so nervous. If he's the underdog I'm OK. I'm basically praying to anyone and everything to send him good vibes. If I'm watching I think maybe I'm jinxing him,' Norlaila told the publication. 

Kyrgios' dad George, brother Christos and sister Halimah also showed their support for Australia's golden boy on Sunday night, sitting in the players' box with his coach Todd Larkham.

The young tennis star served his way out of trouble to notch a magical 5-7 4-6 6-3 7-6(5) 8-6 win to overcome the Italian.

Kyrgios has recently drawn some criticism for his swearing and  feisty exchanges with the crowd at the Melbourne Open. 

The scrappy 19-year-old is facing accusations that he should have been disqualified after he swore at members of the crowd during Sunday's match.  

Midway through Sunday's packed match he yelled out 'turn off your f***ing phone mate' after a loud ringtone echoed through Hisense Arena.

Later, when someone yelled out during a crucial serve, deep in the fifth set, he caustically fired off: 'Are you right, mate?' after losing the point.

He also spotted  three spectators trying to sneak out early before he went on to stage a miracle comeback after a five-set triumph.

In the heat of the moment, Kyrgios interrupted his own match as he called out at the fans: 'Oi! Where are you going?' as the crowd laughed.

His doting mother acknowledged that her son can be a loose cannon on the court but defended the young star, saying she can't control his behaviour like she used to.

'I used to take away his phone when he was disrespectful on court. I can't do that now.' she said.

George Kyrgios look on after as his son made his way through to the next round of the Australian Open 

'People can say what they want but they can't question his guts. He's got guts, he's showed that. And he's learning that,' the mother said.    

Kyrgios' dad made an appearance after the match, saying how proud he was of his son.

'Unbelievable. Unbelievable. I just want to thank all the crowd - it's just unbelievable. They just got him over the line - kept him motivated,' Mr Kyrgios said.

'Thank you everybody - much appreciated and hope we could just go one more.

Kyrgios' dad George and sister Hali watched from the stands as he played against Andreas Seppi in the fourth round 

Nick's brother Christos Kyrgios was deep in concentration as he watched his younger brother smash his way into the quarter-final

When asked if he believed his son could pull through after being two-sets to love down, he responded: 'With the crowd pushing the way it was - his done it before - so his done it again.

'You got one more point to play I'd say. Just give it the best shot and it seems to be working for him so unbelievable.'

Back in August the mother-of-three told the Daily Mail Australia that she gets far too nervous when watching him play, instead preferring to reminisce of 'little Nick's' humble beginnings.

'He started playing tennis because my eldest son, Christos who is eight years older than him, was a tennis player - but not to Nick's level,' Norlaila said.

Kyrgios has attracted some criticism recently for his behaviour on the court  

He celebrated his win against Andreas Seppi on Sunday at the Hisense Arena 

'He was still tubby [when he started his lessons] because he didn't like to run,' she laughed. 

Norlaila said she was beaming with pride and believes he will go far in his career.  

'I'm super proud! But, it's not just "proud", it's just being happy that it's jelling for him. He's thinking about the right things on court. He has lost the plot before many times because of one bad call and he'll be thinking about that and then lose the next two games when he should just move forward,' she said. 

'I'm just super proud he’s thinking about the game and not rushing.'

Last Australian standing at the tennis tournament and the first to reach the quarter-finals since a decade ago by Lleyton Hewitt, Kyrgios will face grand slam champion Andy Murray on Tuesday.
