This dramatic video shows how a car thief managed to evade the police forces of two countries for more than an hour as he travelled at over 150mph after stealing a high-powered BMW  in Germany.

The driver, described as a professional car thief from Lithuania, was eventually caught when he realised he was running out of petrol - and had to dump the car and run away on foot.

German police have been staging a crackdown on the theft of luxury cars by eastern European car thieves and reacted quickly when it was reported that the BMW X6 had been stolen in the Bavarian town of Dachau and that the thief was heading eastwards down the motorway.

Full speed ahead: A Lithuanian car thief leads police on a 150mph chase after stealing a  BMW in Germany

Quick getaway: German police zeroed in on the driver after it was reported that the BMW X6 had been stolen in the Bavarian town of Dachau and that the thief was heading eastwards down the motorway.

The driver evades the police forces of two countries for more than an hour as he travelled at over 150mph

Seven German police cars zeroed in on the car which was travelling so fast that the thief managed to get across the border with the Czech Republic at the Rozvado crossing before officers could move to intercept him.

Officers had radioed ahead to Czech colleagues who also tried to catch the speeding car, but again did not manage to overtake the high-performance German motor.

However, he was unable to shake off the police pursuers completely because they had also called in a helicopter that was able to keep pace with the car on the ground and also to video his attempts to evade capture.

The video shows at one point the car speeding down the motorway with a police car and its blue light flashing travelling behind at excessive speeds. 

Petrol dead: After realising he was running out of fuel, he leaves the road and succeeds to shake off the police pursuit cars, but he fails to shake off the helicopter

Desperate measures: The thief takes a knowing look at the helicopter before disappearing into woodland

On the run: He escapes on foot after dumping his car close to the Czech village of Cerhovice

On his last legs: The driver escapes on foot, pursued by six German police guards, seven from Czech city of Plzen and several policemen from the Czech highway department

And the BMW driver leaves the road and succeeds to shake off the police pursuit cars, but he fails to shake off the helicopter.

In the end, running out of fuel, he dumped his car close to the central Czech village of Cerhovice, and tried to escape on foot but was quickly caught by police dogs who followed his trail into local woodland.

Czech police spokeswoman Marcela Pucelikova said: 'At some points his speed was just over 240 km/h (150 mph). 

'He was followed by six German police guards, seven from Czech city of Plzen and several policemen from the Czech highway department. 

Cornered: Eventually he is caught by a police car and dogs who followed his trail into woodland

Taken down: The driver was later identified as a 34-year-old Lithuanian with several convictions for car theft

'In the end, he was arrested when he went on foot. He had identity papers on him but these turned out to have been stolen in Lithuania.

'It was only through further checks that he was identified as a 34-year-old Lithuanian man with several convictions for car theft in his homeland.'

The thief is currently in investigative custody awaiting extradition back to Germany. 

The stolen BMW is also still in the Czech police pound awaiting shipment back to Germany in the next few days.
