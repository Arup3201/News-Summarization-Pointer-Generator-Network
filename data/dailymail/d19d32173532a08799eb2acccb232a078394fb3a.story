Manchester United legend Ryan Giggs won every gong going during his trophy-laden career and now he can add an honorary doctorate from University of Bolton to his repertoire.

Giggs, who retired as a player from professional football at the end of last season, received an Honorary Doctor of Science for Outstanding Contribution to Sport at a graduation ceremony at Victoria Hall in Bolton on Friday afternoon.

The Welshman adds this to the OBE  that he collected from the Queen in 2007 and the MA that he received from from Salford University the following year.

Honour: The Manchester United legend poses with his degree at Victoria Hall in Bolton

Recognised: Giggs addressed graduate students at the university and congratulated them on their degrees

Giggs wore a yellow and red robe and the traditional mortarboard as he entered the stage to accept the honour.

The University of Bolton twitter feed reported that Dr. Ryan Giggs addressed graduate students, saying: ‘Congratulations on your achievements and hard work’ before quipping that was accustomed to a rather more frosty reaction from football supporters in Bolton.

Professor George Holmes, vice chancellor of the University of Bolton, said: 'Our honorary award recipients have excelled in their professional lives and made an extraordinary contribution to civic life in Britain.

Champion: The Manchester United legend won five FA Cups and 13 league titles in his long career

Managing role: Giggs was interim manager at Old Trafford last season and will remain on the coaching staff

'Many of them share a particular link with our region, and to Bolton itself and the life of our University.'

Giggs brought down the curtain on a glittering career which has spanned almost a quarter of a century in May, after making 963 appearances for the club.

His honours included 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups and two Champions League successes as he became the most decorated footballer in the history of the English game.
