It's one of the most iconic bridges in the world, and so a known spot for grand gestures.

But if ever you find yourself propopsing on New York's rickety Brooklyn Bridge, hold on to the all-important engagement ring - as one Canadian couple find out the hard way last month.

Olivia Fader and Mal Zee vacationing from Halifax, Nova Scotia, with some friends on August 9 when Mal decided to propose to her girlfriend.

The couple were walking along the busy thoroughfare when they stopped to take part in the famous 'love lock' ritual - only Mal's padlock had a ring attached.

'Dont freak out': Mal surprised Olivia at the famous love lock section of the bridge, with the engagement ring on a padlock with a message asking her not to freak out 

Overwhelmed: Olivia was in complete shock when her girlfriend got down on bended knee ...

... And ofcourse she said yes. However neither realized the drama that was just about to unfold

But, no sooner had they put they key into the lock that the diamond fell down onto the wooden platform, slipping straight through the gaps.

'Within seconds we were all on our hands and knees, our eyes pressed between the wooden planks, searching for the delicate diamond ring – a diamond in the rough,' Olivia wrote on a blog she set up about the experience.

'(Then) 40 feet below us, on an industrial platform inaccessible to the public, we spotted the ring.'

One of their friends ran to some nearby NYPD officers, Matthew Manley and William DeFazio, who came to assess the situation, according to The New York Post.

'They were confused at first, but soon understood our plight and committed to getting the ring back to us if it was in their power to do so,' Olivia wrote.

New York's finest: Thankfully, two nearby officers agreed to help, and hatched a plan to get the ring back

Rescue-in-progress: The two officers walked back to Brooklyn, got in there car, drove to the spot where the ring fell, and parked

Success!: After a few minutes, officer Manley emerged with the ring and a big thumbs up

'After much deliberation about their method, they walked back to Brooklyn, drove across the bridge, and stopped Saturday afternoon New York traffic so they could park and make their descent.

'A few minutes later, officer Manley emerged with the thumbs up. The ring was in his hand.

The cops then met the women back in Brooklyn, where they were reunited with the ring.

Mal then re-proposed to Olivia on firm ground, and she said yes.

'There's a lot of hatred and negativity towards our community; we're certain it will be generations before that is eradicated,' Olivia put in the blog post.

'That's why we felt it important to share our story, to provide a bit of hope that there is good out there too.'

Congratulations: The women could not thank the two officers enough for getting the ring back
