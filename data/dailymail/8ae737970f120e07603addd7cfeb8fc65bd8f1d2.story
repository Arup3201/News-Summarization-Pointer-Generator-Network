England look certain to lose their bowling coach as David Saker weighs up numerous offers to return to his native Australia.

Saker, highly regarded for his role with the fast bowlers over the last five years, could even head for home ahead of the end of his contract in September.

Sportsmail understands Saker has been offered three of the glut of coaching vacancies that have appeared in Australian cricket at the same time as he was considering ending his time in England.

It is believed Saker has various offers on the table across the various forms of the game in Australia 

That means he will choose between his two options in the Big Bash Twenty20 competition or a job in state cricket, either with Queensland or South Australia, rather than extend his role with England beyond this summer’s Ashes.

The latest of the many vacancies emerged on Wednesday when Melbourne Stars did not renew the contract of coach Greg Shipperd, a job that would appeal to Saker.

Saker, 48, has unquestionably played a big role in England’s successes after succeeding Ottis Gibson ahead of the World Twenty20 triumph in 2010.

He has developed a strong relationship with bowlers like Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad with his emphasis on man-management and the psychology of bowling rather than any obsession with technique or bio-mechanics.

Yet it has not all been plain sailing for the former Victoria fast bowler and he accepted his share of the blame for the flawed strategy of concentrating on the height of Chris Tremlett, Boyd Rankin and Steven Finn for the last Ashes.

Finn’s technique collapsed under Saker’s watch but it would be extremely harsh to blame the Australian for all Finn’s problems when they appeared to stem from his habit of knocking the stumps with his right knee.

It seems certain that Saker will remain with England for the World Cup but whether he stays beyond it is now doubtful even though his family are settled in the Midlands.

Who comes in next for England is intriguing. Middlesex’s Richard Johnson has his supporters but it is more likely that Gibson, who was back working with the fast bowlers at their pre-tour training camp in South Africa, will be asked to return to the post having left his job with the West Indies.

Meanwhile, Australia coach Darren Lehmann said today he is ‘sick’ of the speculation about the fitness and leadership of injured captain Michael Clarke.

But Lehmann suggested that Clarke is on course to make Australia’s deadline of their second World Cup match, against Bangladesh, to prove his fitness and may even feature in their first one against England in Melbourne.

‘I’m sick of it and I’m looking forward to him coming back,’ said Lehmann as Clarke stepped up his campaign to prove his fitness.

‘He’s captain of Australia, the second most important position here after the Prime Minister, and we need our captain back and playing well.’

There have been strong suggestions here that Clarke is at loggerheads with chief selector Rod Marsh and has even fallen out with a team who now prefer the methods of stand-in Test captain Steve Smith.

But Lehmann said: ‘We all get on, that’s the great thing. From our point of view we want our captain fit for the most important tournament in four years. We’ve got the World Cup, a tour of West Indies and then the Ashes and we want him back because he captains this team very well.’

It seems certain that George Bailey, captain of the one-day team in Clarke’s absence, would be axed from the World Cup if Clarke proves his fitness in time.
