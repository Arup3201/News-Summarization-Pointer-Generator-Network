Two dead bodies - one dismembered and one badly rotten - have been found dumped next to each other in an isolated patch of woodland. 

Police found the corpses in a patch of woodland just outside Brockton, Massachusetts, on Monday. The town is 25 miles south of Boston.

Investigators believe one of the bodies - which was missing limbs - is a woman in her 20s. The woman, who had brown hair, was found near a rotting corpse which seemed to have been there much longer.

The body had decayed so much that police could not tell what age or gender it was. According to local news station WHDH, the find was little more than a pile of bones.

Timothy Cruz, the attorney general for Plymouth County, Massachusetts, said the condition of the bodies showed they had been there different lengths of time.

He added medical examiners are working to identify the two victims, and appealed for anybody who is aware of missing people to come forward.  

The first body was discovered Sunday in a wooded area about a quarter-mile from the parking lot of a Brockton Veterans of Foreign Wars post and near several single-family homes.

Police began a search and found the skeletal remains of the second body on Monday.

One body was determined to be that of a woman believed to be in her 20s, and it appeared to have been dismembered, Cruz said. The gender of the other body, found beneath the other, could not immediately be determined, nor was it possible to know if it had also been dismembered, he said.

Brockton, about 25 miles south of Boston, is a city of about 93,000 residents.

'I realize this is going to be of great concern to residents of the community,' Mayor Bill Carpenter said of the discovery of the remains, adding the city would support the investigation in any way it could.

Cruz declined to say who notified authorities of the first body.

Asked whether investigators fear there could be other remains in the area, the district attorney would not rule out the possibility but added that 'every nook and cranny' of the nearby woods had been searched.
