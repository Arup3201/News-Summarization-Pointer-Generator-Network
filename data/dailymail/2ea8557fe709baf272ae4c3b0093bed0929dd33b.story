Chelsea are confident of announcing the £35million signing of Diego Costa before the World Cup starts.

Jose Mourinho's move for the Spain international is virtually complete, but has been held up by the striker's hamstring injury.

Personal terms with Costa have already been agreed, but his hamstring complaint has delayed the player's Stamford Bridge medical.
