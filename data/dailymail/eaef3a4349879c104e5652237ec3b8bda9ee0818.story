Some family doctors are already being paid £200 to diagnose dementia - more than four times the amount to be offered under a controversial new government proposal.

GPs get the extra money if they identify patients with the condition and then implement a care plan to help them.

The £200 payments - made to doctors in Bristol - were already in place months before Wednesday's pledge by ministers to dramatically improve rates of dementia diagnosis.

GPs in Bristol are already being paid £200 to diagnose patients with dementia and develop a care plan - four times as much as the Government's £55 'cash for diagnosis' scheme which was announced on Wednesday

NHS Bristol Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), which runs GP practices in the area, has offered GPs a £200 'bonus' payment if they increase their diagnosis rates by 5 per cent, or if they reach a target of 65 per cent of  dementia diagnosis expected in the area.

This is on top of rewarding practices with £500 for signing up to a voluntary scheme brought in last year which required GPs to screen at-risk patients for dementia.

48 out of 55 GP practices in Bristol opted into the local scheme.

Defending the payment, NHS Bristol CCG told Pulse magazine the bonus was set up to support family doctors taking on dementia care from specialists.

The payments are also so GPs have extra resources to diagnose patients and review their care, it added.

The news comes after ministers announced on Wednesday that GPs would be paid £55 for every patient they diagnose with dementia under a controversial new scheme.

It is being rolled out by the NHS due to concerns that family doctors are picking up less than half of all cases.

Around 850,000 patients in Britain are thought to have dementia but only 45 per cent have had a formal diagnosis.

This has partly been blamed on an attitude of fatalism among doctors and patients who assume the diagnosis is pointless as so little can be done. 

Doctors already get extra money for performing a host of medical checks on such as blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes.

The Patient's Association said the Government's proposal to pay GPs for diagnosing dementia is a 'step too far' and will mean 'rewarding poor GPs'

But the new payments for diagnosing dementia have been heavily criticised by the Patient's Association who said it was 'rewarding poor GPs'.

Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association, said: 'We know GPs receive incentive payments to find all sorts of conditions, such as high cholesterol, raised blood pressure and diabetes - but this seems a step too far.

'It is putting a bounty on the head of certain patients.

'Good GPs will be diagnosing their dementia patients already. This seems to be rewarding poor GPs. It is a distortion of good medical practice. 

'There is an issue of people presenting late with dementia to doctors, but this is not the right way to go about tackling that.

'If people were given hope that something could be done, that would be the greatest incentive for coming early.' 

The Taxpayer's Alliance also spoke out against incentivising GPs to make certain diagnoses.

Campaign Manager Andi Silvester said: 'Aren't GPs already paid to diagnose diseases and illnesses via their wages? 

'It seems bizarre that you would hand out extra payments to GPs just because the patient walking through the door has dementia rather than a sore throat. 

'Spotting dementia is a worthy goal, but we'd expect GPs to do it as part of the job they're already compensated for.

'There are also obvious, inherent risks to encouraging certain diagnoses over others.'

But the criticism was dismissed as unfair by doctors who claim it will help, not hinder, diagnosis.

Dr Nick Cartmell, a GP in Devon and part of the South West support team for dementia, said: 'What we are recognising is that general practitioners are in an ideal position to provide quality care to our patients with dementia and which is a new type of care that we haven't provided in the past.

'Therefore it is entirely appropriate that that care has investment attached to it.'

The scheme encourages GPs to increase their understanding and awareness of dementia and local services, he said.

It will teach them how to pursue a diagnosis, support patients through that process and how to help them after they've been diagnosed, he added.

He said: 'We need to look at this in the bigger picture, we don't have that many people who have a deep a profound understanding of the politics behind dementia care.

'Not many people understand the pressure at the moment for us to increase diagnosis rates, which is political pressure, not from good medical practice.

'If we had all that out in the open people could judge for themselves.' 

The national scheme is understood to be the first country-wide initiative to offer doctors financial rewards for diagnosing patients with any condition.
