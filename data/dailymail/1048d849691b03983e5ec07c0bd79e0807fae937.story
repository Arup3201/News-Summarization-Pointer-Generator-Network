A 42-year-old mother has been accused of beating up and threatening to kill her daughter's chemistry teacher over bad grades.

Ruth Nathalie Perkins has been charged after allegedly attacking Elvira Tomlin as she taught about 20 students after hours at Dr. Phillips High School in Orlando, Florida on Thursday.

Perkins stormed into the portable classroom and began cursing at Tomlin in Spanish, even threatening to murder her, according to the arrest affidavit.

When Tomlin
 tried to call for help, Perkins allegedly knocked her phone off the desk and slapped her cell phone out of her hand.

Click Orlando reportedÂ Tomlin told Perkins to leave the room, but she refused.

Perkins
 then knocked Tomlin's glasses off her face and pushed her against a 
wall, scratching her face as Tomlin tried to push her away.

Two students were forced to pull Perkins off of the teacher and she left the classroom, according to the affidavit.

Perkins was allegedly furious at the grades Tomlin had given her daughter.

Perkins was later arrested in the school's parking lot.

An Orange County Public Schools 
spokeswoman said parents 
are not required to sign in at the front office before going to their 
child's classroom after school hours.

'I feel bad for the students that witnessed the incident and were upset by it. I want to thank all of those that gave me their support during this difficult time.'

Perkins was held on $10,000 bail, but has since bonded out of the Orange County Jail, Sun Sentinel reported.

She has been charged with aggravated battery on a public or private education employee.
