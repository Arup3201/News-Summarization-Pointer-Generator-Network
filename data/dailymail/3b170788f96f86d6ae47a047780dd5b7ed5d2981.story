Stoosh the skunk is taken for a walk by Mimi

Most little girls want puppies or ponies as pets, but seven-year-old Mimi has bucked the trend with her pet skunk.

The one-year-old North American skunk named Stoosh lives with Mimi, her mother Jema, 31, step-father Dale Preece-Kelly, sister Amber, 10 and brother Zach, 6 in Rugeley, Staffordshire.

The unusual pet has been welcomed into the family and is treated like a domestic animal, with Mimi cuddling her in bed and taking her for walks on a lead.

Mr Preece-Kelly said: 'Stoosh was part of the family just like a cat or dog would be and she was a real character.

'We do turn some heads taking her for a walk on the lead, people are generally really interested once they’ve got over the shock.

'At first they think she is a badger.

'Of course we’ve all got the images of skunks from cartoons like Pepe Le Pew, but she actually smells lovely, just like a cat or a rabbit and she is very clean.

'She is very soft to stroke and she’s a very intelligent, she rules the roost in our house and even gets into bed with us.'

'She has only ever sprayed once when our dog growled at her, but it takes months to recharge the scent glands and it really is the last resort.'

Mr Preece-Kelly said Stoosh likes a varied diet and has her own ‘Princess’ feeding bowl.

'She used to like scrambled eggs but she’s more keen on raw eggs now, then it’s fruit and nuts, Brazil nuts are her favourite. And she eats chicken.'

Best friends: Mimi and her unusual pet are inseparable, she follows her around the house

Bedfellows: Stoosh the skunk has become a domestic pet and shares a bed with her owner Mimi, 7

Unusual: Mimi takes charge of walking and feeding Stoosh, who is described as a 'real character'

Stoosh has become a regular feature 
at Mr Preece-Kelly's pet therapy company Critterish Allsorts, where 
animals are used to help with therapy and education.

'The patients love Stoosh - the hospitals that we visit regularly are medium high secure psychiatric hospitals - and she really does help.

'Her behaviour is amusing, she is cuddly and will lie on their laps to be petted. Some of the patients only come to visit with Stoosh.

'One guy used tocome to the sessions before I had Stoosh, and have a quick look and leave, but the moment he met Stoosh, that was it - a big smile on his face, he sat down on the sofa and patted his lap.

'He sat with Stoosh for about 45 minutes before leaving. An hour afterwards, he came and found me having drawn a picture of Stoosh sitting on his lap. Amazing.

Royal treatment: Stoosh eats raw eggs, nuts and chicken from a pink princess bowl

'The patients have ownership for Stoosh, they see her as theirs as she is a regular visitor to them.

'She has trust in them and does not judge them in anyway, she is safe and honest, and they genuinely care for her, and all of the animals that visit.'

The family said they think limits should be put on who can own a skunk. Mr Preece-Kelly said: 'There is currently no need for a permit to own a skunk in the UK, but I do think it is something that should be considered.

'Prices for skunks are high so that breeders can make sure they go to suitable homes.'
