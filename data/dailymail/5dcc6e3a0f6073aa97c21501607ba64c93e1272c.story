Iker Casillas has poured cold water on rumours of a move away from Real Madrid.

The goalkeeper has two years left on his contract with an optional third at the Bernabeu, and has declared he is happy at the club he has been at since starting as a youth in 1990.

The 33-year-old temporarily lost form but feels he is back to his best after playing his 700th game for Real in their Club World Cup win on Saturday.

'It's been my best year. Four titles and I played in all of them, it doesn't get much better than that. I can't forget those things just because I had a bad six weeks', Casillas told Marca.

'Let's take things one step at a time. I'm under contract and have no reason to think about leaving.'

Casillas was part of the Real side that beat San Lorenzo 2-0 to win the Club World Cup, and wrote on Facebook afterwards: 'The last trophy in a great year for a group of athletes who are making history.

'I feel privileged to have played my 700th match for the club where I came through the ranks.'
