Sierra Leone is being shut down for three days in a bid to stop a surge in cases of Ebola. 

The country's president Ernest Koroma has ordered everybody to stay at home between now and Sunday in an effort to halt the spread of the killer disease. 

Sierra Leone had a previous nationwide curfew in September at the height of the epidemic.

The Christian Examiner reported President Koroma's remarks, urging his people to work together. 

He said: 'The future of our country and the aspirations of our children are at stake,

'I call on every Sierra Leonean in every community to pull together. The economic development of our country and the lives of our people continue to be threatened by the ongoing presence of Ebola in Sierra Leone.'

According to the World Health Organisation, there were 33 confirmed new cases of Ebola in Sierra Leone in the week of March 22. 

The WHO said that that one-third of these cases were in the capital Freetown. 

As healthcare workers on the ground battle against the spread of the disease, two experimental vaccines against Ebola are now undergoing clinical trials in Liberia. 

A total of 600 people are being inoculated against the disease.

The country's six million population have been told that the curfew could eliminate the disease from the country. 

Thousands of teams will fan out around the country, knocking on doors to remind people how Ebola is spread and how to prevent it. In the hot spots — the regions around the capital and in the north — health workers will also search for Ebola cases.

Alfred Palo Conteh, the head of Sierra Leone's Ebola response, says a major goal of the campaign is to fight complacency, more than a year after the outbreak was declared in West Africa.

Ebola has infected nearly 12,000 people in Sierra Leone. 

In total, almost 25,000 have been infected with Ebola during the current outbreak claiming the lives of more than 10,000 people.
