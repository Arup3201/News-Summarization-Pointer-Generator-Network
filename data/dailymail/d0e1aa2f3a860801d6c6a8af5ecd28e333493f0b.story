A mother from Massachusetts refused to listen to her five-year-old son’s desperate pleas to steer off the railway tracks as she drove drunk for half a mile on Friday night before crashing into a train signal.

Beverly police said Michelle Monique LeClair, 46, of Salem, an unemployed divorcee, had a blood alcohol content of .18, more than twice the legal limit, when the incident happened.

The mother slammed her 1999 Ford Explorer into train signals and fencing at Beverly Depot shortly before 10pm on Friday with her son in the back seat, according to the Boston Herald.

Charged: Michelle LeClaire, 46, during her arraignment on drunk driving inside Salem District Court on Tuesday. She drove her car on the train tracks for half a mile while her son, 5, screamed for her to stop

According to police reports, the child had begged his mother to stop ‘because it was wrong and the train might be coming’.

Even as the boy leaped from the wreck, police said his mother ‘was still trying to drive the vehicle as the engine was revving and the tires were spinning’.

Police said LeClair ‘had no concept that she actually drove one-half mile down the railroad tracks’.

LeClair and her son survived the ordeal with no major injuries, but police said the heavily damaged vehicle was surrounded by gushing gasoline.

The woman appeared on Tuesday in Salem District Court to charges of drunken driving, reckless endangerment of a child and reckless operation of a motor vehicle, to which she pleaded not guilty.

She was released on $1,000 cash bail by Judge Matthew J. Nestor, who barred her from both drinking and driving. LeClair declined to comment.

Police say LeClair told them she was on two prescribed medications used to treat depression and anxiety, according to the Boston Herald.

Her son’s father, Jeremy LaBrecque, 
37, told police ‘we were drinking margaritas all night’ while out to 
dinner at a Japanese restaurant in Beverly with two other children, ages
10 and 12.

LeClair, 
who has no prior criminal history, but has had three surchargeable 
accidents since 1994, had suddenly got up and left with their son.

The Registry of Motor Vehicles has suspended LeClair’s driver’s license and police reported the incident to the state Department of Children and Families (DCF).

The DCF said in a statement: ‘The Department of Children and Families received a 51A report regarding this incident and is conducting an investigation.

'This child is not currently in the custody of the Department. DCF has had prior involvement with this family.’
