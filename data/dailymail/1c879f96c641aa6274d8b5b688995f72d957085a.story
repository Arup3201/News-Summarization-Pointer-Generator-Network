The world's most expensive red wine has been put on display at an upmarket vino vendor in Dubai.

The limited edition 12-litre bottle of Chateau Margaux 2009 comes with an eye-watering £122,380 price tag.

A mere six Balthazars, meaning 12-litre bottle, of the exclusive tipple
 have been produced, with only three of those set to go on sale.

Expensive: The limited edition Chateau Margaux is the most expensive bottle ever to be sold. The 12-litre bottle comes in its own ornate oak case and is engraved in gold

Estate: The vineyard in the Midoc region of France produces the extravagant wine. Paul Pontallier, chief winemaker and managing director of the estate, says its history stretches back 400 years

Good grapes: The three buyers of the 12-litre bottles will be able to tour the vineyard

The wine is produced at the Chateau Margaux vineyard in the Midoc region of France, just north of Bordeaux.

'Chateau Margaux's history stretches 
back over 400 years, during which the estate has produced some of the 
world's best wines time and again,' Paul Pontallier, chief winemaker and
 managing director of the estate, said.

'The Chateau Margaux 2009 vintage is one
 of the finest we have ever produced, hence why we chose to bottle it in
 this magnificent format.'

The wine is currently on show at wine merchant Le Clos' flagship store at Dubai International Airport.

The Balthazars are housed in an 
ornate oak case, while the bottle itself has been beautifully engraved 
with gold by master craftsmen. 

Although the wine will put a serious dent in any oenophile's pocket, buyers get a number of other perks for their money.

They will be flown first class to France to visit the Chateau Margaux estate, where they will enjoy a private tour of its cellars and vineyard, before sitting down to dinner with the chief winemaker.
