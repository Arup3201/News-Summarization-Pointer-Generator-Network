How best after the ‘plebs’ crisis for ministers to demonstrate solidarity with hard-pressed Britons? The answer, according to George Osborne and two Cabinet colleagues, is apparently to down tools early and go to the opera.

The Chancellor, along with Education Secretary Michael Gove and Culture Minister Ed Vaizey, took prime seats for a near-six-hour performance at the Royal Opera House on Wednesday afternoon.

Despite the economic crisis, they all managed to knock off early to attend the 4pm start for the second instalment of Wagner’s Der Ring des Nibelungen.

It is sung entirely in German and lasted five hours and 50 minutes.

Yesterday, the ministerial trio risked being dubbed the ‘three tenors of Whitehall’ for placing their opera treat ahead of all other priorities.

And nor could they claim to be doing their bit for the economy after it emerged they paid nothing for their seats.

Each was a freebie, gifted by the Royal Opera House which sent out lavish invitations to VIPs for the sought-after performance.

While ordinary punters had to shell out 
up to £250 for tickets - most of which sold out within an hour - the 
minsters were given some of the best seats in the house.

The Chancellor - who famously vowed to the 2009 Conservative Party conference: ‘We’re all in this together’ - and his comrades were spotted in the sumptuous box of the Royal Opera House’s chief executive, Tony Hall.

They would have been offered complimentary fine wines and other refreshments to sustain them during the afternoon and evening.

While his two Cabinet colleagues took front row seats in the box, Mr Osborne seemed less keen to be spotted, taking a seat behind them.

Mr Hall, a former senior executive at the BBC, invited the ministers because they had a ‘particular interest’ in the rare Wagner performance, said a Royal Opera House spokesman.

He said: ‘It was an invitation from the chief executive to sit in his box.

‘We invite not just members of Parliament but people from different walks of life to tell them about what we do here.’

The government is still reeling from another elitism crisis after Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell was accused of swearing at policemen in Downing Street and calling them ‘plebs’.

David Cameron and Mr Osborne, who were both members of the infamous Bullingdon dining club at Oxford University, have long struggled to shake off the impression they are out of touch with ordinary working Britons.

Outspoken Tory MP Nadine Dorries recently branded them both ‘arrogant posh boys’.

Yesterday Mr Vaizey added to the impression of being a ‘minister for fun’ by complaining he was not allowed to have a computer games console in his office.

In an interview with the Independent newspaper, he blamed the ‘powers that be’ for refusing his request as inappropriate.

‘I
was encouraged not to, in case it looked frivolous,’ said. ‘But I think
I will renew my campaign. I have a television so why can’t I have a 
games console?’

Mr 
Vaizey, 44, who says he plays the popular Angry Birds game on his iPhone
and Monopoly on his iPad, maintains that he needs the console because 
the gaming industry is an important sector of the British economy.

Last
night, neither the Treasury nor the Department for Education responded 
to requests for comment on Mr Osborne and Mr Gove’s trip to the opera.

Mr Vaizey’s spokesman said: ‘The performance ran for 5hrs 50mins including intervals, hence the earlier-than-normal start.’

He said that as Culture Minister, Mr Vaizey was ‘expected’ to support the publicly-funded Royal Opera House by attending performances ‘from time to time, as his diary allows’.

‘He greatly enjoyed the production which he believes will, in time, be judged an artistic triumph and become a big earner for the company,’ said the spokesman.

He added: ‘I wouldn’t take the comments about having a games console in his office too seriously. He is minister responsible for the UK video games industry, which is one of our really big economic success stories in recent times, so it’s not too surprising that he would like to be able to show off the best amongst them to visitors to his office, but having a console is not his highest priority at the moment and he would most certainly not expect public money to be spent providing one.’
