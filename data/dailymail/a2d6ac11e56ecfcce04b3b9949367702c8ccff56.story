Supermarket workers have been given electronic listening devices so conversations with customers can be recorded.

The system has been adopted by Sainsbury’s at 600 of its ‘Local’ convenience stores as a safety measure to protect staff from violence and abuse.

However, campaigners fear it is yet further evidence of a surveillance state that is invading the privacy of shoppers and could be abused.

Shoppers are already familiar with the CCTV cameras that monitor their every move, plus the collection of information on buying habits through loyalty cards and the security tagging of everything from razor blades to premium steaks.

Now supermarkets are going even further and using the fob type listening devices, which are attached to uniforms or sit on a lanyard around the neck.

Sainsbury’s insists the monitoring system, which it calls a personal safety device, is entirely legal, above board and necessary to protect staff.

It said the listening devices are triggered on average around 30 times a week by workers if they are abused, racially harassed, verbally or physically threatened.

However, it refused to provide precise details of how the system works or name the outside company that runs the regime on its behalf, citing security reasons.

It has placed small yellow signs in stores where the system operates, which carry the wording: ‘For the safety and security of our colleagues and customers, audio may be monitored and recorded’.The director of Big Brother Watch, Nick Pickles, said most people would be unaware that they could be spied on in this way, while buying their groceries.

However, campaigners fear it is yet further evidence of a surveillance state that is invading the privacy of shoppers and could be abused

‘People should not be subject to secret filming and audio recording unless there is an extremely serious situation,’ he said.

‘It frankly isn’t good enough to justify such an intrusive capability by posting a small sign up at the shop entrance.

‘People should be clear such technology can be used and if it is being used, it should be done in a way that customers have an opportunity to complain if they feel it is not justified. 

‘Sainsbury’s must be transparent about how many times these systems have been used to record their customers and why. 

‘They should also make available much more information about how the systems work and when staff can use them. Without such transparency it is impossible to have confidence that the systems are not being abused.’ 

While Sainsbury’s would not give details about its system, it confirmed the devices are similar to those used by community workers in the NHS and among some other retailers, such as petrol stations.

The NHS system is run by a company called Reliance Protect.

The devices include a panic button on the back, which, once triggered, connects via the mobile phone network to a central security station.

Here, a security officer listens in and records the conversation to decide whether to alert the police. The device includes a GPS satellite tracker to pinpoint the location of the wearer.

Tesco said that some staff in its Express convenience stores have personal alarms which, if triggered, alert security officers to watch the CCTV screens and decide whether to call the police

Asda said it did not have anything like the Sainsbury's system in place

Sainsbury’s said the point of recording what is said is to gather evidence that could be used in any subsequent prosecution of the shopper.

It said it is only used in 600 convenience stores as staff numbers are low and a colleague may not be available to help in an emergency.

It said that once members of the public start abusing or harassing staff it does not consider this to be a conversation or the individuals involved to be customers.

A spokesman said: ‘Some colleagues in small stores wear a personal safety device, which is only activated when they or other customers are threatened or when a crime is taking place and they need to raise the alarm.

‘It operates for about ten seconds to help determine which emergency service to call. The same personal security system is used by the NHS and is recommended by the police. We take the safety of both our colleagues and customers extremely seriously.’ 

The use of recordings and CCTV fall under the Data Protection Act, which is policed by the Information Commissioner’s Office.

A spokesman said: ‘Organisations must only record people’s conversations where it is a clearly justified response to a pressing need. 

‘Use of audio recording should be exceptional and only triggered in response to a specific event, like when a member of staff is being abused or assaulted and it may stop further abuse or would be needed as evidence. 

‘Individuals should be made aware audio recording may take place, staff should be trained in its responsible use and once the recording is made, it must be kept securely and be deleted once it is no longer required.’ 

Sainsbury’s main two rivals, Tesco and Asda, have their own CCTV and other security systems in place, but nothing that involves listening to and recording conversations.

Tesco said that some staff in its Express convenience stores have personal alarms which, if triggered, alert security officers to watch the CCTV screens and decide whether to call the police.

Asda said it did not have anything like the Sainsbury’s system in place.
