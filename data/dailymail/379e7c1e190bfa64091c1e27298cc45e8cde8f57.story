They are famed for their ability to remain entirely focused on their job, even in the face of camera-laden tourists and wannabe jokers.

But this Queen's Guard finally cracks a smile - and even giggles - as a determined American tourist performs a stand-up routine for his friends while standing alongside the soldier in London.

Dressed in the uniform of the Household Cavalry Regiment, the soldier stares impassively ahead as the man, identified by his friends in the video as Yankel, stands next to him and starts talking to the camera.

Sharing a joke: The tourist whoops with delight as he finally gets the guard to smile with his comic routine

As Yankel pretends to reminisce about their schooldays together, the soldier remains unmoved, but encouraged by his friends off-camera the comedian continues.

Speaking about how he's known the soldier for '30 years' since they were at school in 'Kensington' together, Yankel says: 'He was never talkative.... He would sit in the corner reading and answer questions with his head.'

As the soldier struggles to contain his smile, and urged on by his fellow American tourists - the comic goes on to talk about how the soldier was picked up from school every day by his mum, until he was 20.Â
