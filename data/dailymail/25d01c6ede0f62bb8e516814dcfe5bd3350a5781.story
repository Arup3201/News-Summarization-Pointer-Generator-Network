He was the UK's favourite TV star, loved by millions who tuned into Jim'll Fix It each week, before being exposed as a predatory paedophile following his death in 2011.

Now Jimmy Savile's nephew Guy Marsden, 60, has revealed that he came within a whisker of being sexually abused himself but was inadvertently saved by his uncle.

In 1968, aged 15, he and a group of friends ran away and got the train to London where they were met by two men who invited them back to their flat.

Lucky escape: Guy Marsden was ensnared by a paedophile ring but was saved from abuse by his uncle

Close shave: Guy Marsden, pictured here aged eight, was also taken to Savile's parties but wasn't abused

Unbeknown to Guy and his friends, the men were part of a paedophile ring and would regularly scour stations in search of vulnerable youngsters to abuse.

'I would have said about 30,
 rock and roll, with leather jackets and long hair and that,' he remembers.

'And they said: "Do you want to come to our place and that?" You’ve 
got to try to remember that there were no such thing as perverts.

'There 
was but you didn’t hear of them. There weren’t even a name "paedophile" 
out then I don’t think.

'So we just thought oh they like us, you know. So
 anyway we ended up going with these back to their flat.'

Four days later, Guy's uncle Jimmy arrived at the flat with a group of young children and a vicar in tow.

Guy, thinking his uncle had been asked to find him by his family, was horrified. 'I thought that me Uncle Jimmy had caught 
me there,' he says.

'I was proper scared, I was terrified if 
you want. But now I’m 60, I think he didn’t catch me I caught him.'

Guy, who tells his story on TV documentary Crimes That Shook Britain, says he has since worked out what was really going on.

'These people would pick people up from 
train stations, as in younger people,' he explains. 'We’d then go to their houses.

'And 
then the ones higher up the chain would come to these houses to see who 
they’d picked up to take them elsewhere to do whatever they were going 
to do with them.'

Because his uncle was Jimmy Savile, Guy thinks word quickly spread that this was one child not to be touched.

'When I think back I cringe because I 
think you could have ended up in the bottom of the Thames,' he confesses.

'I 
think it’s only because I was, you know, Jimmy Savile’s nephew, my Uncle
 Jimmy’s nephew, that nothing like that did happen.'

Others, however, were not so lucky. By the time Savile died aged 84 in October 2011, his victims were estimated to number more than 450.

Guy, who has written a book about his experiences, is all too well aware of what went on and says he saw the disgraced star with children during parties at his home.

'I had no conception of paedophilia or
 child abuse or anything,' says Guy, who lived with his uncle for a few months when he was 15 along with three friends.

'Neither had any of the other three.  So to us,
 our thoughts were, it’s a party. You know the people who live there.

'It ended 
up where we were like huddled together, four of us, and then these 
little kids would come over to us.'

Although Guy was unaware of what was happening to the children at the time, he regularly saw Savile wander past with groups of children in tow.

'My Uncle Jimmy 
didn’t even speak to us or acknowledge us, although every now and again you might 
have got a nod.

'He just seemed to come in, flitter about, you know 
whatever he were doing - bringing little’uns in and stuff like that and 
then he’d go.

'I’ve recently found out that I were going to get "groomed" to do what the people down 
London were doing - getting the kids and probably older girls and 
older boys to go to these parties up here in Leeds and places like that.'

'I think most decent people find it 
incomprehensible that these, sort of, organisations, rings, whatever we 
want to call them exist but no less incomprehensible than why would 
anybody abuse a child,' comments Peter Saunders, Chief Executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood.

'The fact that people come together to do it seems
 in a way somewhat more scary because very often we’re talking about 
people from all walks of life, including those from the upper echelons of society.' 

By the end of the year, Guy had returned to Leeds, far from his paedophile uncle, and was separated from him further courtesy of a spell in Borstal.

When he emerged, it was as a young man ready to start a career and begin a family, both of which he later did.

Although he became close to his uncle in later life, even giving a gushing tribute when he died, Guy says he wasn't surprised to hear of his uncle's crimes.

‘Although I wasn't sexually abused I do feel like a victim myself,' he adds. 'I think I should have reported him years ago but I was too scared to do it. Now I am really pleased everyone knows the truth.'
