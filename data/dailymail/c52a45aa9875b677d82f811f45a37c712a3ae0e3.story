When five-year-old Breanna's mum came home to find the little girl had let her pet cow into the house, she gave her daughter the chance to explain - with some rather interesting results.

While her pet calf Izzy lies on the porch floor next to the family dog at their home in Pennsylvania, little Breanna gets creative to explain the unexpected house guest.

As her mother Billie Jo Decker films, the adorable five-year-old tries saying that the cow walked in when the door was open and she was looking the other way.

'You're telling a fib,' her mum responds. 'Now do you want to tell the truth about it?'

After another gallant attempt at explaining the presence of Izzy the  cow, Breanna settles down to stroke her pet and the calf leans in to be cuddled before falling asleep with her head on the child's lap.

The mom explained that the calf's mother gave birth to her in a swamp in late November, and Izzy very nearly froze and drowned.

Billie Jo said Izzy has been with them since she was just days old and Breanna has bonded with her since 

'She was very sick when she arrived,' Billie Jo commented on the video. 'She didn't have very good chance of surviving as she developed pneumonia and had water in her lungs'

'She of course is a bottle baby so human touch and interaction is all she knew. She came here only a few days old and [I] Iet my little girl bond with her as much as she wanted.' 

Billie Jo added: 'Overriding all my instincts to say "don't do that" I wanted to see them grow a bond, and I of course wanted to raise a happy and loving cow.

'The first time I witnessed this cow wanting to be hugged and cuddled with my jaw dropped because I, like most, have been led to believe they are different.'
