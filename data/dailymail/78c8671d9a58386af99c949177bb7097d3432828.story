Justin Bieber fans have 'converted to Islam' on television in a bid to secure tickets to one of his shows.

The fans - known as 'beliebers' - tried to see their Canadian hero in concert by taking part in the stunt on Norwegian station TV Norge.

The girls were told to remove all make-up, put on hijabs and recite what was reported to be an Islamic statement of belief in Arabic before reading a piece of Arabic text aloud.

Norwegian news website Dagen reported that the fans were also made to say: 'Justin Bieber is unclean and probably gay'.

The stunt featured on the comedy show called 'Anne-Kat', hosted by award-winning comedienne Anne-Katrine Hegna Hærland.

She said: 'We wanted to find out how far Norwegian "beliebers" are willing to go for tickets to one of Bieber’s concerts.'

The show has been heavily criticised by faith leaders, who said it trivialises people's faith.

The controversy comes weeks after Bieber was dubbed 'insensitive' after leaving a message in a guestbook while visiting Anne Frank's house
 in Amsterdam.

The star 
wrote in the log: 'Truly inspiring to be able to come here. Anne was a 
great girl. Hopefully she would have been a Belieber.'

Reports in the Middle East speculated that Bieber is planning to buy a home in Dubai

Halyor Northug, Bishop of the Norwegian 
Lutheran Church, told Dagen that the stunt on 'Anne-Kat' 'testifies to Hærland’s 
lack of understanding of how much faith means to a lot of people.'

He 
added: 'This is an example of an idea where irony and lack of 
respect turns into something tragic.'

Bieber is hugely popular in Norway and last year authorities in Oslo almost declared a state of emergency in the capital city as thousands of youngsters flocked to a free concert.

This year, several Norwegian schools rescheduled their midterms to accommodate students with tickets to Bieber's recent performances.

The Canadian superstar hit the headlines recently after he posted a racy cartoon depicting himself in 
bed with a naked girl lying on his chest with the words 'Justin 
Belieber' emblazoned across the top on Wednesday.

He also cancelled a gig in Oman after it was reported authorities said his performances were 'too sexy.'

Middle East websites are now speculating that the superstar wants to live in Dubai, after he added another concert date in the city.

After splashing a £4.2 million in California on his first home last year, reports suggest Bieber wants a place in Dubai so he can stay there when he plays on May 4 and 5, and keep his options open should he ever fancy a move to the emirate.

An obvious choice for the teen heartthrob might be an apartment in the Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world where properties cost about £4.5 million.
