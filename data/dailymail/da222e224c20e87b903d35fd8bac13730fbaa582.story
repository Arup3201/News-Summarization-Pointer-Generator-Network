Many smartwatches track exercise and calories, but now a new wristband allows parents to keep tabs on their children.

The wearable phone and GPS tracker is designed to be worn by children and allows them to call their parents.

It is thought that Tinitell will be among the smallest commercial mobile phones on the market when it launches and will be operated through the click of a button or via voice recognition.

No more lost kids! The Tinitell wearable phone and GPS tracker (pictured) is designed to be worn by children and allows them to make calls as well as enabling their movements to be tracked by parents

The watch is designed to be practical for playtime and does not have a delicate screen. Instead, it has a large button to select a function and will use voice recognition to allow children to a particular contact.

If a child were to say ‘mum’ the watch will call the assigned number linked to a pre-recorded voice label.

Children will be able to search for contacts manually using volume keys on the side of the watch to access other numbers.

More advanced features will be controlled by parents via an accompanying smartphone app, which they will be able to use to see the location of their children on a map, as the watch has built-in GPS.

When Tinitell is launched, children will be able to make phone calls to their parents using the colourful watch.

It will be operated by clicking the large button or via voice recognition.

It is available to pre-order on Kickstarter for an early bird price of $99 (£52).

While the watch is not completely waterproof, it is splash proof and can withstand quick dips in water.

Tinitell was created by Mats Horn in Stockholm, who came up with the idea in 2012 while hanging out with a friend who is also a father.

He is now raising money on Kickstarter to put his invention into production and is approximately half way to reaching his goal after pulling in just under $60,000 (£35,530).

Tinitell is available to pre-order on Kickstarter for early backers for $99 (£52) and is expected to be sold later for $179 (£106).

It is common for children to take mobile phones to school, but smartphones are expensive and can be lost easily.

Mr Horn said his friend’s son wanted to go outside and play but didn’t have a smartphone.

‘He had lost a cell phone once before 
and we didn’t feel like lending out our smartphones. Worst of all, we 
couldn’t join him outside because we were busy cooking dinner. His son 
ended up playing in his room with his iPad, and I thought that was sad.’

This led Mr Horn to create the simple mobile phone for children - 'Nothing advanced, just a nicely designed speaker and microphone to handle quick ‘hellos’ and ‘come here’ signals,’ he said.

He saw that the market for a simple mobile for children was still largely untapped and that no big companies had thought of the idea.

‘I realised it’s not in their DNA to make products less advanced. I saw a huge opportunity and customer benefit that I felt obliged to tackle with an affordable solution.’

The Swedish start-up was previously privately funded with loans through the Swedish entrepreneurship infrastructure.

Tinitell won Sweden’s largest entrepreneurship competition in 2013 and was declared as the country’s most promising tech start-up.

He said that Tinitell’s purpose is to facilitate voice communication between parents and their younger children.

The $40 LeapBand has motion sensors built in, and connects to a special mobile phone app to allow parents to see how their children are doing on the activity based games.

A wearable computer than can track activity, download apps and even play games has been released.

However, while it may sound like the much awaited Apple iWatch, in fact the LeapBand is aimed at a very different audience - four to seven year olds.

The firm behind it says the gadget can help parents keep track of how much exercise their children are getting.It boasts a built-in accelerometer, a high-resolution color screen, a rechargeable battery and water-resistant design.

It comes preloaded with 50 different activities and challenges, tracking a child's physical moves so the more active a child is, the more points they earn with their virtual pet.

As the child earns points through active play, they can unlock additional games, challenges, levels of play and virtual rewards for their on-screen pet.
