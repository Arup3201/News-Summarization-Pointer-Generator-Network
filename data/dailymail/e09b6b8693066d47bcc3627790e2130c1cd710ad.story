After the balmy weather of Boxing Day, 
which saw many people frolicking in the sea in the unseasonably mild 
weather, strong winds ripped through the northern part of the country.

Winds of up to 90mph in Blackpool, Newcastle and Scotland whipped up the sea, causing waves 
to froth and crash against the promenades.

The gales were so strong that shoppers braving the Christmas sales clung to their hats and, in some 
cases, each other, as they faced the gusts.

And the fierce weather looks set to continue, with snow expected in Scotland tomorrow and the rest of the country will be gripped in freezing cold temperatures.

The Met Office issued a wind weather 
warning for the North East and urged motorists to take extra care on the
roads after the accident which saw the vehicle plough through the 
building.

A 
spokesperson for the Met Office said: 'Very strong winds will affect 
northern Britain today, including the populated Central Lowlands 
of Scotland.

'Gusts of 60 to 70 mph are expected, with 80 to 90mph possible in exposed coastal areas of the west. 

'The public should be aware that this could cause disruption to transport.'

Julian Mayes, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, said the strongest winds recorded in the most exposed areas had 'approached 90mph'.

He said: 'In Ayrshire and the Western Isles we have seen frequent gusts of 65mph-70mph. In South Uist and Tiree, gusts reached 79mph. The west of the country has definitely seen the worst of the weather.

'Across the Central Belt the highest wind speeds have been around 70mph but we expect that the worst is now over.'

The severe weather meant the funeral of a teenager allegedly murdered on the Isle of Lewis was postponed for two days.

The service for Liam Aitchison was due to take place in Daliburgh, South Uist, but the arrival of his body from Inverness was delayed by the cancellation of ferry sailings to the island, the parish priest said.

Gale-force winds tore were so severe that one lorry overturned in Newcastle, narrowly missing a pub.

The vehicle ended up toppling over besides The Globe Pub in Newcastle-upon-Tyne as gusts 
reached speeds of 65mph in the area.

A spokesperson for Northumbria Police said they were investigating how the lorry crashed but there no injuries.

The outlook is expected to get increasingly cold for the next three days, forecasters Meteogroup UK predicted.

Tomorrow
will be a fairly cloudy and windy day across the UK with showery 
outbreaks of rain spreading south-eastwards, these becoming increasingly
wintry across Scottish hills.

However, some bright or sunny 
intervals are likely, these mostly across northern areas. Temperatures 
generally close to the average, but colder across Scotland.

Tomorrow night showers will generally
die out through the first part of the night to leave most of the UK dry
but rather cold with clear periods and a frost. However, rain is 
expected to arrive across south-west England and south Wales but strong 
winds will ease through the night.

The outlook for Friday is a fine, cold start in eastern and northern areas with a ground frost. 

However,
rain already in south-western parts will gradually spread across 
remaining areas through  the day. The rain will become heavy over high 
ground with snow expected across the Scottish mountains for a time.

New Years Eve will be a fairly cloudy day across the UK with patchy rain, this clearing to heavy showers in western Scotland.
