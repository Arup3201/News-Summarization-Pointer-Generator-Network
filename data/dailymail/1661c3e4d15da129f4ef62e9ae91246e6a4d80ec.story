Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said he was shocked and saddened at the reception former Southampton skipper Adam Lallana was given on his return to St Mary’s.

The 26-year-old midfielder, who spent 14 years at Southampton, left for Liverpool last summer and was roundly booed by home fans — as was defender Dejan Lovren, who also left at the end of last season. 

Striker Rickie Lambert, an unused Liverpool substitute, was given a better reception back at his old club.

Rodgers said: ‘Today was always going to be difficult for the likes of Dejan and Adam. I was a bit disappointed for Adam. 

'He was captain here for two years, gave incredible service and could have left a number of times and didn’t. To get the reception he did was disappointing.

‘There was nothing in the match programme referencing his time here. No mention for Lambert as well.  

Lallana - who spent 14 years at Southampton - was an excellent servant to the south coast side

'Those two guys gave their heart and soul to Southampton and were big supporters of this club. They’ve moved to one of the biggest clubs in the world. Those two guys were wonderful servants.

‘It was a massive decision for them to come to Liverpool. For former servants or players, there’s always appreciation. But nothing here.

‘For me, that’s a wee bit sad. I was thinking of them today looking at the programme before the game. Everything they gave to this club to get them here today, and not a mention.’

In fact, Lallana and Lambert were referenced more than 20 times in the programme.
