Nico Rosberg has described himself as '100 per cent German' in the wake of Lewis Hamilton's latest playful dig at his Mercedes team-mate's upbringing.

Following his superb British Grand Prix triumph on Sunday, Hamilton was asked how valuable it would be to win Rosberg's home race next up in Germany on July 20.

Responding with a grin, Hamilton replied: 'To be honest Nico has never actually been in Germany, so it's not really his home race.'

Hamilton then recounted a tale of their karting days when Rosberg used to stand by a flag of Monaco given he was raised in the principality from four months old after being born in Wiesbaden.

The 29-year-old appreciates the fact, though, Rosberg will have full support from the fans in Germany, so knows a win there would be 'great'.

In response to Hamilton's comments, following the first of two days of an in-season test at Silverstone - with his team-mate to take up the wheel on Wednesday - Rosberg said: 'Anyone can judge however they want.'

Asked whether he was as German as Hamilton is British, an honest Rosberg replied: 'Not really because I didn't grow up in Germany, but I consider myself 100 per cent German.'

Naturally, however, Rosberg would love to follow in the footsteps of Michael Schumacher and Sebastian Vettel and win in front of his home fans.

Looking ahead to the race, Rosberg added: 'It'll be great, driving the Silver Arrow - a dominant Silver Arrow - it will be special.

'I hope I get a lot of support, and I'm looking forward to it.

'But even the British crowd at Silverstone were great. Okay, they supported Lewis, but I got a lot of respect, and that was really nice to see.

'In some ways even I could enjoy the great atmosphere they brought to the race track at the weekend.'

With the 11 teams at the test focusing on a variety of different aspects of set-up and development, it meant the times were largely irrelevant.

Overall, Rosberg finished third on the timesheet with a lap of one minute 35.573secs, with Williams' Felipe Massa quickest with a 1:35.242.
