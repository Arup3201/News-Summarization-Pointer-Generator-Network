It's Hot or Not time again as Ian Ladyman reveals what's been making him feel warm this week and what's been leaving him cold inside. 

WHAT'S HOT 

NIGEL CLOUGH 

On receiving a letter of complaint from a Derby County supporter, Clough, the club's manager, drove round to his house. 

Nigel Clough has guided League One Sheffield United to the semi-finals of the Capital One Cup

Later that year he received correspondence from another fan suggesting his 18-year-old son could get in his team. Clough invited the lad to training and threw him a pair of boots. 

Lovely tales, both, but they do more than suggest Clough jnr has a flick of his old man about him. They tell you that Clough knows his mind and this is something evident in the way he selects his very best team for cup matches. 

Hired last season to keep United in League One, he did that but I would imagine his club's fans will treasure the memory of the FA Cup semi-final that followed rather more. A year on and Clough's team have a sniff of Wembley again. 

United's league form may suffer if they do make it to the Capital One Cup final but Clough will take the risk. 

Football is supposed to be about guts and glory. Nobody writes letters to football managers to thank them for finishing eighth do they?

MIKE BREARLEY

The Australian quick Dennis Lillee used to tell toiling batsman: 'You've got some s**t on the end of your bat'. On seeing the more gullible flip the bat over and examine the bottom, Lillee would add: 'Wrong end mate'. It was crude but it was funny. 

What was only one of these things was Michael Clarke's welcome to Jimmy Anderson when the Englishman arrived at the crease in Brisbane last winter. 'Get ready for a broken f*****g arm,' grunted the Australian captain.

The Aussies aren't the only exponents of what the modern cricketer ludicrously calls 'mental disintegration'. Typically, they're just better at it than everybody else. The point is, though, that it's not amusing and there is too much of it. 

The current interpretation of sledging is one step removed from bar room name calling and before long there will be a fight on a first class cricket pitch. 

Former England captain Brearley – now chairman of the ICC's World Cricket Committee – has asked for the issue to be on the agenda of next week's meeting and he is quite right to do so.

RAHEEM STERLING 

When you can really play, you can play just about anywhere. 

Back from a break in the Caribbean, Sterling must have wished he was back in his hammock when manager Brendan Rodgers asked him to play centre forward against John Terry and Gary Cahill on Tuesday night. 

At times during the first half, the little Liverpool forward looked as likely to score as Mario Balotelli, who wasn't even at the ground. Sterling, though, has football intelligence and, like all the good players, he found a way to get it done. 

His dash towards goal from deep for Liverpool's equaliser resembled a rugby scrum-half spotting a gap from the 20-metre line and was the work of a quick mind. 

All that Roy Hodgson nonsense about Sterling complaining about tiredness in October sounds like background noise now and it should have been treated as such at the time.

WHAT'S NOT

EVERTON 

Like the day Tiger Woods drove his car in to a fire hydrant outside his house, sometimes it's not the incident that ultimately transpires to be important but what it reveals. So it is with the curious case of Kevin Mirallas and the stolen penalty kick.

Three questions: Where was captain Phil Jagielka when Mirallas decided to shove Leighton Baines to the back of the queue? Why did Baines give way so meekly? Why, in essence, did Mirallas feel so confident he could get away with his act of impertinence in the first place? 

These are the issues that make Everton look as though they have gone soft under Roberto Martinez. 

A couple of weeks ago, Jagielka gave newspaper interviews claiming media stories about shouting matches in the dressing room were so false they made him laugh. One final question: Everton are four points from the relegation zone. If nobody is shouting, why not?

RUUD GULLIT 

The clip in which Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal appeared to refer to his opponents as 'Queens Park Raisins' should have been the stand out blooper on Match of the Day. 

However, he was eclipsed by one of the programme's own as Gullit provided an insight in to what can happen if you don't pay attention. There was a beautiful arrogance about Gullit's football but that doesn't work as an analyst and last weekend he appeared short on preparation. 

Asked by host Gary Lineker about Paul Lambert, he started to talk about Ricky Lambert. One manages Aston Villa while the other is occasionally a centre forward for Liverpool. 

Later in the show, Lineker commented: 'Stoke in to the top half' to which his guest replied: 'Could be.' Stoke are, of course, already tenth.

Small details perhaps but it's the small details that give a pundit the platform on which he can make broader and bolder statements with credibility. Without these he is nothing.

MARTIN KAYMER 

Golf can make you so unhappy it's no wonder those who depend on it to feed the kids find ways of pretending that the bad stuff was really quite good. This was Kaymer after his final round in Abu Dhabi last weekend. 

'I didn't hit many fairways and I didn't make many putts,' said the German. 'On the other hand I was playing really good golf.' 

Martin Kaymer was defeated by two over the course of 14 holes at Abu Dhabi last week

Certainly Kaymer's collapse from ten shots clear to defeat by two over the course of 14 holes hints at much more bad than good but the really sad thing about his demise is that the bloke who actually won the thing – World number 357 Gary Stal – is already lost in the story. After all, who remembers the name of the horse who won the Devon Loch Grand National in 1956? 

Young Stal should be celebrating the greatest day of his young life but the reality is that the 22-year-old is already on his way to becoming little more than an answer to a rather obscure quiz question. 

*The horse was called ESB, by the way.
