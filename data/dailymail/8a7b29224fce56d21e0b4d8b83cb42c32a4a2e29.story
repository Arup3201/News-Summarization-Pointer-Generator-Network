The number of people admitted to hospital due to drinking has doubled in the past eight years, figures have revealed.

They show the number of hospital admissions rose to almost 1.2 million last year.

The shocking total – a nine per cent rise on the past 12 months alone – includes more than 7,000 teenagers.

On the increase: More people are being admitted to A&E because of alcohol-related injuries and illness, with a 9% rise in the past year alone

It is also more than double the overall figure for 2002/03, when alcohol-related admissions stood at 510,780, according to data from Local Alcohol Profiles for England. London saw the biggest jump in the past year, at 14 per cent, followed by the East of England with a 10 per cent rise.

Overall for England, there was an 11 per cent increase in admissions, from 1,056,962 in 2009/10 to 1,173,386 in 2010/11.

Separately, provisional estimates show 7,074 hospital admissions for people under 18 due to alcohol since January, according to a written parliamentary answer to shadow public health minister Diane Abbott. Mrs Abbott said ministers needed to ‘get a grip’ on binge drinking adding: ‘The alarm bells should be ringing with the publication of these figures.’

‘It is clear that for [Health Secretary] Andrew Lansley, the be-all and end-all is whether his friends in big business are happy, and, unfortunately, it is costing our NHS and British families an absolute fortune.’

Today's data also showed an increase in the total number of hospital admissions for alcohol in England, from 1,056,962 in 2009/10 to 1,173,386 in 2010/11, a rise of 11 per cent.

In 2002/03, the figure stood at 510,780 admissions for alcohol.

Mrs Abbott cited a recent report which predicted binge drinking will cost the NHS £3.8billion by 2015, with 1.5million A&E admissions a year.

In England in 2002/03, there were 926 admissions per 100,000 people for conditions attributable to alcohol, rising to 1,898 in 2010/11. In 2009/10, the figure was 1,743 per 100,000.

Mr Lansley blamed the previous Labour government for fostering easy availability of alcohol.

He said: ‘These figures are disturbing evidence that, despite total consumption of alcohol not increasing recently, we have serious problems with both binge-drinking and long-term excessive alcohol abuse in a minority of people.

‘These consistent rises show Labour took their eye off the ball on tackling alcohol abuse during their 13 years in power. Their reckless policies included the decision to unleash a 24-hour drinking culture in our country.

‘We have taken real action by imposing high taxes on super-strength beers and ciders and banning below-cost alcohol sales.’

Under the ban on the sale of low-cost alcohol, which will come into force on April 6 next year, shops and bars will not be able to sell drinks for less than the tax paid on them.

But health campaigners, led by the British Medical Association, said the below-cost price ban would make little difference to rising numbers of problem drinkers, claiming the price ‘floor’ was too low to have any impact.

Mr Lansley said further measures will be set out in an alcohol strategy in the new year.
