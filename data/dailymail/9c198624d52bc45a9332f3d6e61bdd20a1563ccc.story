A piece of seat leather stained with the blood of President John F. Kennedy has gone up for auction.

The piece of ragged dark blue leather was splashed with the blood of the 35th President when he was shot as he rode an open-top limousine through Dallas, Texas, in 1963.

It is one of ten morbid relics of the killing which will go under the hammer at Los Angeles-based auctioneers Nate D. Sanders, with reserves as low as $250.

'Bloodstained': The strip of leather stained with the blood of President John F. Kennedy which is up for sale

It was 50 years ago last November that the Kennedy assassination shocked the world.

People had lined the streets of Dallas to welcome the President when, as his motorcade drove through the city's Dealy Plaza, the sound of gunfire shattered their celebrations.

At 7.30pm the Municipal Auditorium in Austin had been due to play host to a Texas welcome dinner in honour of President Kennedy, Vice President Lyndon Johnson and their wives.

But JFK was pronounced dead at 1pm and the event was shelved as the nation mourned.

Twenty-six staff name badges from that dinner are the star lot in the sale, with an estimate of $5,500. An invitation to the party is expected to make £500.

It reads: 'In honour of John F. Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson.

'The State Democratic Executive Committee requests the pleasure of your company at the Texas Welcome Dinner.'

Cancelled: An invitation to the banquet due to be held in Kennedy's honour later on the day he was shot

Unspoken words: A bound manuscript of the speech Kennedy was due to make that is also up for sale

Another lot is an unused press ticket for the dinner. It was to permit access to the balcony overlooking the auditorium and orders reporters to 'keep this portion of the ticket at all times'.

One of the most prized in the collection is a booklet entitled, 'The Unspoken Words of John F. Kennedy at Dallas November 22, 1963'.

The eight-page manuscript was the speech that JFK never gave because he was shot dead as he sat in his limousine and waved to admirers.

It was privately printed in 1964 for Stanley Marcus, who died in 2002, the chairman of the board of luxury Dallas-based retailer Neiman Marcus.

A Dallas Morning News edition bearing the headline 'Kennedy Slain on Dallas Street' and a copy of the Dallas Times Herald giving an account of his funeral and Oswald's killing are also going under the hammer.

Old news: Original copies of Dallas dailies recounting the events of the assassination and its aftermath 

But perhaps the most macabre item is a piece of leather from the back seat of the Lincoln Continental JFK was riding in when he was shot.

The piece of ragged dark blue leather was kept by F. Vaughn Ferguson, the Technical Service Representative at the White House responsible for the presidential automobiles.

After the assassination Mr Ferguson was told to prepare the bloody presidential limousine for the new president Lyndon B. Johnson.

But he found the car dismantled by the FBI, who were searching for bullet fragmants and evidence. It was never used by Johnson.

Macabre mementoes: The programme for the dinner and, right, an unused press ticket 

A press pass for the event

The leather was later acquired Dr. John K. Lattimer, the ballistics expert consulted by the Kennedy family independently who confirmed the fatal shots were fired by Oswald.

It has since been mounted in a display case that includes a picture of Kennedy just minutes before he was killed. 

A note included with the display says it is 'bloodstained', but this cannot be clearly seen to be the case from photographs.

Kennedy was the 35th U.S. President, holding office from 1961 until his death two years later.

During his brief presidency he oversaw some key historial events like the Bay of Pigs fiasco, the Cuban Missile Crisis and Project Apollo, which led to the moon landings.

The mystery that still surrounds his death has caused many to speculate that he was murdered by the Mafia and even the U.S. Government.

Lee Harvey Oswald, who remains the prime suspect in the assassiantion, was shot dead by nightclub owner Jack Ruby as he was being escorted by police days after the murder.

Last year, an AP poll showed more than 59 per cent still believe more than one person was involved in killing Kennedy.
