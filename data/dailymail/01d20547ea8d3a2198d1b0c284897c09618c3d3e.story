An overweight ginger man catapulted to top spot in Next's quest to find a top model has quit the contest after receiving abuse on his Facebook page and at home.

In a statement on his online profile, Roland Bunce declared he was pulling out of the competition, citing the threats as the reason.

'Just to let you all know I am quitting the next model contest,' he wrote.

'It was a big honour to win and it's 
been fun but the amount of abuse I've been getting since Thursday is out
of control and I've now just been threatened.

Support: A Facebook group set up in Mr Bunce's honour won thousands of fans - but some cruel users posted threats and abuse

'Can't go into all the reasons but just know that the decision wasn't taken lightly and I can handle some insults but when people ring your house and email your work then it's not fair.'

'Thanks to everyone who has supported me but I am now bowing out before this gets any worse.'

The shock decision from the unlikely star has led to fans from the UK, Australia and Hong Kong pleading with Roland to reconsider his decision.

Abuse: One cruel commentator writes on the page set up to support Roland Bunce

'You are 
such an inspiration. You got guts, and self-security... something none 
of the other people in the competition have,' one wrote.

Another
added: 'Dude get you're a*se back in that comp now and win it for the, 
as they put it, normal people. I'm fully behind you.'

While another said: 'What a bunch of scumbags, threatening and abusing big Buncey.'

But one cruel Facebook user said: 'I'm
surprised Next didn't kick u out themselves, people like u make a 
mockery of the fashion industry. We want real models, not ginge fattos 
like u (sic).

Unlikely candidate: Mr Bunce rocketed to the top of the Next modelling poll after receiving 66,000 votes, but has now pulled out after receiving abuse on his Facebook page

Another anti-Bunce post read: 'Your campaign is pathetic. You're promoting an obese person? Unhealthy (your taxes are paying for his care!!!). Wonder how he got to that stage in the first place probably because he sits on his a** stuffing his face full of cream cakes all day and you all think he is wonderful? Fat people make life harder for people who are relatively fit and choose not to be gluttonous pigs. What idiots you all are.'

Mr Bunce had stormed to victory in 
the early stage of the competition, and was set to be judged by a panel 
of experts later this week.

The unconventional-looking wannabe 
model romped through the public vote in an online poll by the High 
Street giant to find a model after his application was hijacked by 
internet jokers.

The 
24-year-old's popularity surged after his appearance caught the eye of 
voters last month, and he marched to victory in the poll after beating 
5,000 other contestants.

The High Street chain had launched 
the 'Next Model' competition to find a future catwalk star and invited 
members of the public to vote for their favourite contestant.

The computer engineer from Belfast - who 
notched a massive 66,000 votes to the 89 for the stunning blonde in 
second place - was to compete in the final round of the competition in 
front of an expert judging panel.

Roland was one of 250 finalists to
be whittled down to 50 by the judges for the grand final of the Make Me
A Model competition on July 30.

Roland's rivals: Mr Bunce can be seen at the top of the pile alongside other potential winners of the £2,000 prize

On his Facebook fan page, Roland 
wrote: 'Thanks for all for the support and thanks to the person who 
started the group, I'm overwhelmed.'

The unlikely candidate clocked up
10,000 'likes' on his Facebook page last month after the campaign for 
him to win the competition gathered pace.

The
Next 'Make Me a Model 2011' competition launched a month ago and had 
more than 5,000 entries before the closing date on June 28.

The winner of the competition will be awarded £2,000 Next vouchers, a photoshoot and an introduction to a modelling agency.

A spokesperson for the retail giant 
said: 'We'd love for Roland to attend the next round but we haven't 
received any contact from him so we can't confirm or deny this yet.'
