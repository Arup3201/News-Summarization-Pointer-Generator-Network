A young Tory newcomer who was inspired by David Cameron to enter frontline politics has been elected leader of the party in Scotland.

Openly gay Ruth Davidson, 32, only took a seat at the Scottish Parliament at the Holyrood election in May, but has already become the first overall leader in a shake-up of the party north of the border.

She was immediately congratulated by Prime Minister David Cameron.

He said: 'I am delighted to congratulate Ruth on winning this leadership election and look forward to working with her to strengthen the Union and build a better future for Scotland.'

Ms Davidson, a kick-boxer and former Territorial Army member, was elected in a closely fought campaign against three other candidates.

Runner-up Murdo Fraser, who was eliminated in the last of three rounds of counting, had pledged to scrap the 'tainted' Tory brand, proposing to set up a new centre-right party for Scotland.

The controversial plan prompted Ms Davidson, a regional MSP for Glasgow, to enter the race and defend the current Scottish Conservative and Unionist party.

After being declared winner at the count in Edinburgh, she said: 'The Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party is very much alive and kicking.

'It is now up to all of us to build on that momentum and drive the party forward to a new and exciting age of success.'

As the successor to former leader Annabel Goldie, Ms Davidson will head a group of 15 Tories at the 129-seat Scottish Parliament, which is now dominated by First Minister Alex Salmond's SNP.

Turning to the forthcoming referendum on Scottish independence, she said: 'We in the Scottish Conservatives have a duty as well as an opportunity to be the party that stands up for Scotland as a vital component of the Union.

'We must not allow the SNP to tear up
that right. Scotland is not being served if politicians behave like 
rabbits caught in the headlights of Salmond's separatist steamroller.

'We must have the courage and 
conviction to stop him in his tracks by always presenting and promoting 
the positive case for the Union.

'Of course, a union that does not 
adapt and evolve will inevitably become stale, so it is essential that 
we adjust, refresh and revitalise the partnership.

'But strong, enduring marriages do 
not end in divorce, they continue to provide safety, security and mutual
benefit and respect. That will always be worth fighting for.

'This is a time of generational 
change for the Scottish Conservatives, a party for all, regardless of 
age and of background. I want everyone to feel that they have a place, a
role and a voice that can and should be heard.

'I want to engage the whole party from the grass roots up and to extend that conversation with the electorate at large.

'The hard work starts here. Today is the first day of a new and bright future of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party.'

Following the result, Mid Scotland and Fife regional MSP Mr Fraser underlined a potential division in the party.

He said: 'Clearly I'm disappointed that I was not able to persuade more of our members that my vision for the future is the correct one.

'But I congratulate Ruth Davidson on her victory, and she will have my full support, as she tries to take the party forward.

'I think the bold and radical proposal that I had - to create a new centre-right party for Scotland, to replace the Conservatives - was a leap too far for the majority of our members.

'A sizeable minority, 45 per cent, voted for my proposal but it was not enough.'

He secured 2,096 first preference votes against Ms Davidson's 2,278.

David Mundell, the only Tory MP in Scotland, supported Ms Davidson's bid and said: 'Ruth embodies the radical, generational change that the party needs to rebuild and reclaim its place at the heart of Scottish politics and Scottish life.

'I look forward to working closely with her and I am certain she will be a first-class leader for the whole party.'

Leadership challenger Margaret Mitchell, a late entry to the race, was knocked out with 472 votes in the first round.

The fourth contender, Jackson Carlaw, who was taken to hospital with appendicitis during the campaign, was tipped by some to win, but was third with 830 first-choice votes.

There were 5,676 votes cast in a turnout of 63.4 per cent.
