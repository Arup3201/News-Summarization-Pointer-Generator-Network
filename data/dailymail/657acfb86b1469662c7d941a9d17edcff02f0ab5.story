Police searching for a teenager who went missing three months ago have found a body.

Nida Naseer, 19, disappeared in December after going to put the bins out at her home near Newport in South Wales.

Today Gwent Police said they were called to Newport Wetlands at West Nash Road after the discovery of a body - the site is about four miles (6.5km) by road from Linton Street, where Nida was last seen.

Her family has been informed although the body has yet to be identified and the death is being treated as unexplained.

The teenager was last seen at her home in Pill, Newport, at 8pm on December 28.

She was not wearing shoes and did not have her phone, money or coat with her.

Since then her mobile phone has not been used and no evidence of her being alive or dead has been found.

Relatives and police described her 
vanishing as 'totally out of character' - especially as she needs 
medication which stops her from becoming anaemic.

Her
 older sister, Shamyla, 23, told a press conference earlier this year 
that she believed Nida’s disappearance was due to her being upset about 
being unable to attend university.

Before she left she had argued with her family about her education and was 'shouting and crying'.

Gwent Police confirmed they were called to the Newport Wetlands site today after the discovery of a body

A force spokeswoman said: 'We were called to the Gwent Wetlands site on West Nash Road at 10am this morning where a body was discovered. It has yet to be identified'

'I
 think that not being able to go to university is the reason for her 
leaving,' she said, speaking alongside other family members at Newport 
Central police station.

Despite getting good grades, Nida’s 
status as a failed asylum seeker meant she would not receive any funding
 to study for a degree - the family came from Pakistan five years ago but their application was turned down a year ago - they have since appealed.

The conference heard that Nida did not have a boyfriend and was described by her family as 'very religious'.

Before she left the teenager had argued with her family about her inability to go to university and was 'shouting and crying'

Earlier this month, police said they had decided to stop ground searches for the teenager.

A
 force spokeswoman said today: 'We were called to the Gwent Wetlands 
site on West Nash Road at 10am this morning where a body was discovered.
 It has yet to be identified.

'The death is being treated as unexplained and a post-mortem examination is due to take place.

'Nida’s family has been informed that a body has been discovered and we continue to give them support.'

Her older sister, Shamyla, 23, told a press conference earlier this year that she believed Nida's disappearance was due to her being upset about being unable to attend university

The family placed a sign on the door and issued public appeals to encourage Nida to come home
