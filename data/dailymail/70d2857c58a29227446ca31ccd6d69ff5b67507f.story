Michael Phelps' intersex girlfriend was convicted to two years in jail for stealing $10,000 from a businessman, she claims.

Taylor Lianne Chandler went by the name David Roy Fitch when, at the age of 19, she blackmailed a man she met in a Maine bar in 1992.

It was, she claims, a desperate bid to pay for gender reassignment surgery, which she completed years later before striking up a romance with Olympic gold medalist Phelps.

Her choice: Chandler began taking testosterone blockers in her teens, and had corrective surgery in her early twenties to get rid of her male genitalia 

Feet in the sand: Chandler has since been a champion for gender rights

Chandler only served 33 days in state prison before receiving a two-year probation order.

She claims she pleaded for probation after being raped by three men in her cell. 

She explained on Facebook: 'At 19, I thought it would be smart to blackmail someone into giving me the money for my surgery.

'As soon as I received the money I was arrested and charged with extortion. 

'I spent 30 days in jail because I was too ashamed to tell my family what happened thinking no one knew. 

'Even though my birth certificate and drivers license said female they put me in a cell with 3 men and I was raped. 

'I sued the state of Maine and got them to provide training for staff to deal with people on different spectrums of gender. 

'They even created new facilities for housing someone with special needs. 

'I plead and got probation for two years. I went on the talk show and tabloid TV circuit pleading my case for gender rights. 

'After a brutal rape and a horrible trial in 1993 I went away to get my surgery and changed my name to Taylor Lianne Whitney to escape back into anonymity and have a normal life. 

'For the last 20 plus years that is exactly what I have done.'

The revelation comes a day after Chandler first revealed she was born with both male and female genitalia. 

As a teenager Chandler went on testosterone blockers and had her name changed and then, in her early twenties, underwent corrective surgery to get rid of her male genitalia.

Chandler was born a male however in name only, and is actually intersex, meaning she had male genitalia, but no testicles, while also having a uterus and no ovaries. 

As she explains in a Facebook post, 'I was never a man, never lived as a man. No one can say they knew me as a man or produce a photo of me as a man.' 

She then adds, 'There are people that remember me as an androgynous child at times because of what was forced upon me.'

She is also revealing how in love she is with Phelps, and claims the two clicked after meeting on Tinder.

'Spending time with him was like a teenage love affair,' she says. 

'I have never felt so comfortable and accepted in every way as I did with him.'

She had previously detailed their first date, to a Baltimore Ravens games, to the National Enquirer.

'One thing led to the next, and we made love during halftime,' she claims in the interview.

'Later, we had sex again. The intimacy with him was amazing! It was the first time in my life that someone has made me feel like a true woman.'

She also told the magazine that she never lied to the swimmer about her past, saying it just never came up.

Now however, Chandler thinks Phelps may 'leave her' after telling her truth.

'I am probably going to lose him because he is a brand that his team wants to protect and things since he went to rehab came to my attention that didn’t put him or our relationship in the best light,' she says. 

Her Facebook is a shrine to the swimmer, with his photos plastered all over her wall and banner.

She also seems to repost any and all stories that mention their relationship. 

He's out: Chandler said on her Facebook on Wednesday that Phelps is out of rehab

Still on?: Phelps has yet to comment on any of this 

Chandler claims she was with Phelps when he was arrested on suspicion of DUI on September 30 in Baltimore, Maryland.

The swimmer entered rehab just a few days after the incident and completed his program on Wednesday according to Chandler.

The alleged couple also have a bit of an age gap between them, and Phelps is 29 and Chandler is 41-years-old.

Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time with 22 medals, is currently serving a six month suspension from swimming as a result of his DUI.

In her post, Chandler also takes some time to discuss the difficulties she has faced in her life. 

'In my early teens I was medically diagnosed and went on testosterone blockers, at 15 estrogen enhancers. My birth certificate was modified along with my name while I was a teenager, prior to any corrective surgery,' she explains. 

'I originally changed my name to Paige Victoria Whitney. At 16 I legally emancipated from my family. I had already left home at 15. At 18 I got in trouble twice, once for a bad check and then a DUI.' 

'At 19 I thought it would be smart to blackmail someone into giving me the money for my surgery. As soon as I received the money I was arrested and charged with extortion.' 

'I spent 30 days in jail because I was too ashamed to tell my family what happened thinking no one knew. Even though my birth certificate and drivers license said female they put me in a cell with 3 men and I was raped.'

She has since spent much of her life crusading for gender rights.
