A Norwegian tourist was raped twice in one night in separate attacks on her way home from a barbecue, a court heard.

Marius Stakele, 24, and Aftab Mohammed, 39, who are unknown to each other, allegedly forced themselves on the woman just hours apart after she asked for their help getting home. 

The intoxicated victim, who has not been named for legal reasons,  had no idea the second attack had taken place until police carried out a DNA tests.

The 23-year-old had spent the afternoon drinking at a barbecue in Lancaster Road, Romford, Essex, on May 9 last year, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.

The intoxicated victim was alleged to have approached Stakele and his friend at Canning Town Station (file picture)

She was so intoxicated she believed she was at Heathrow Airport when she approached Stakele and his friend at Canning Town station on the DLR.

They walked with her towards the A13 Canning Town flyover where Stakele allegedly smashed her head against a concrete wall and raped her.

She later reported the attack to police and tests revealed she had been raped by a second man, the court heard.

Pam Oon, prosecuting, said: ‘She had too much to drink at the party, by midnight she was drunk, getting quite emotional, crying and making a scene, so a taxi was booked to take her and a friend home.’

During the journey she had behaved unreasonably and tried to get out of the taxi while the vehicle was moving.

She was eventually let out on her own in New Road, Dagenham, but left her phone and new jacket in the car.

Ms Oon continued: ‘There’s a period [between midnight and 4am] where the alleged victim doesn’t have any recollection at all, and it’s during this period that the prosecution say she was raped by Mr Mohammed.’

The woman said the first thing she remembered was being at Canning Town station at about 4am.

The victim allegedly met Mohammed after knocking on the booth of his building site near the A13 in Dagenham. Pictured: A31 in Dagenham

‘She asked someone what time the trains were leaving and ended up speaking to two eastern European men - she asked what time the trains were leaving and they told her they didn’t leave for another two hours.

‘She went with them to the Canning Town Flyover, the men were walking either side of her, holding her, she tried to leave them but they said no - the situation didn’t set of any alarm bells with her, then the other man left.

‘[Mr Stakele] tried and succeeded in taking advantage of her in her drunken state, he attempted to kiss her, and attempted to kiss her again when they were under the flyover.

‘He slammed her head against a concrete wall and then pushed her on to her knees.’

The woman later told police Stakele raped her and forced her to perform a sex act on him.

She had bruising to her cheek and eye socket after the attack and lacerations across her back and torso from all the broken glass on the ground.

Ms Oon said: ‘During the entire incident she struggled, she tried to get away, she didn’t consent to any of the sexual activity and the prosecution say that nothing that she said or did could be interpreted as consent by Mr Stakele.’

The young woman sought help at Canning Town Station and a staff member who helped her described her as ‘trembling, but like someone who had had a shock, not like someone who was cold or on drugs’.

Mohammed, a security guard, was only tracked down via DNA evidence, and the alleged victim had no memory of him at all, saying she had never had sex with an Asian male before.

He claimed the victim had knocked on the window of his booth guarding a building site near the A13 in Dagenham and had begged him for a lift.

Mohammed told police he had refused at first, because it was against company policy to give lifts in a work vehicle, but eventually changed his mind..

During the journey, he said the woman had told him she ‘wanted to make love’.

Ms Oon said: ‘He said he took her to an area of waste ground near St Stephens Road and that’s where they had sex and he didn’t force her, said he had asked for his number - out of concern he gave her money to get home.’

CCTV footage from Canning Town station showed Mohammed dropping the young woman off in his work car.

When he was interviewed by police, he showed them where he had thrown the complainant’s bra in some rubbish bags on some nearby wasteland.

‘She has no recollection, she had a feeling she took a taxi because there’s no way she could’ve walked there from Essex, she doesn’t recall talking to anyone.’

Mohammed, of  Manor Park, London, denies two counts of rape, and Stakele, of no fixed address, denies two counts of rape, one count of attempted rape and one count of assault by penetration.

The trial continues.
