A mother says she will never dye her hair again after she suffered a horrific allergic reaction to her hair dye.

The reaction was so severe that the mother-of-one had to be prescribed steroids and it took eight weeks for her skin to heal.

Lyn Gregory, 56, from Poole, in Dorset, claims she suffered the reaction to Schwarzkopf Live Colour despite having completed a skin test 48 hours earlier.

Lyn Gregory (pictured before the allergic reaction) has vowed never to use hair dye again after claiming she had a severe reaction to Schwarzkopf Live Colour which left her with agonising blisters

Ms Gregory said: ‘I’ve been dying my hair for as long as I can remember. My hair is very white now so I just dye the underneath.

‘I’ve even used this brand of dye before and not had a reaction, and I always do a patch test first. It left me in agony. I had to cut my hair to stop it brushing on my neck and irritating it.

‘I will never dye my hair again.’

Ms Gregory claims she was prescribed steroids by her GP for blistering skin reaction she suffered.

She was forced to take time off from her job as housing officer for the local authority as the reaction worsened.

She said: ‘I did the test on Friday ready to dye my hair on Sunday. I was using blue dye.

‘When I used the dye it felt a bit itchy, but nothing bad. On Monday it was a bit worse, then on Tuesday it went mad.

‘I went to the doctors who prescribed antibiotics and a cream, but it got worse before it got better and I had to have steroids.

‘The skin blistered all along my neck line. It was agony - I couldn’t even go to work or sleep.

‘I only left the house to go to the doctors or the supermarket. Everyone would stare at me like I was a freak.

‘It made me feel awful in myself as well. Everyone was very worried about me.’

Ms Gregory says she did not suffer any sign of a reaction from the test or previously when she used the same brand of dye.

Ms Gregory says that she did a skin test and that it showed no sign of a reaction. She says that she had also used the brand before without any problems

Ms Gregory has now recovered but she is hoping to be awarded compensation by Schwarzkopf

She is now looking to claim compensation from Schwarzkopf.

Nicky Hastings, a representative from Schwarzkopf, said: ‘We are sorry to hear about Ms Gregory’s reaction and hope that she has now fully recovered.

‘We were advised of Ms Gregory’s reaction by her solicitor. As such we are not able to comment in such circumstances.’
