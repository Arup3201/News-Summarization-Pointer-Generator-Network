US officials have
identified about 300 Bosnian immigrants who they believe
concealed their involvement in wartime atrocities including the
1995 Srebrenica massacre.

The number of suspects could eventually reach more than 600 as more Bosnian records about violence between Bosnian Serbs, Muslims and Croations become available.

Federal authorities are trying to deport at least 150
of them, The New York Times reported on Saturday.

The immigrants were among refugees fleeing the violence in
Bosnia after a war that erupted in 1992 with the collapse of
Yugoslavia. 

The number of suspects could eventually be over 600
as more records from Bosnia become available, the newspaper
reported.

'The more we dig, the more documents we find,' Immigration
and Customs Enforcement historian Michael MacQueen, who has led
many of the agency's war crimes investigations, told the Times.

Many of the Bosnian suspects were former soldiers and they
include a Virginia soccer coach, an Ohio metal worker and four
Las Vegas hotel casino workers, the newspaper said.

Some are now U.S. citizens.

The Times said evidence indicates half the 300 Bosnian
suspects may have played a part in the massacre at Srebrenica,
where 8,000 Muslim men and boys were killed by Bosnian Serb
forces in five summer days in 1995.

Some of those thought to be involved in mass killings in the Balkans are now US citizens. Above, a Bosnian Serb woman mourns over the remains of her son killed in 1992 after it was found in a common grave

The massacre came towards the end of a war
that claimed 100,000 lives.

The massacre was the culmination of a policy of ethnic
cleansing by Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic's
forces to carve a pure Serb state out of a communally diverse
Bosnia. 

Visa applications in the mid-1990s asked about military service, but there was little way of verifying what applicants from the war-torn region reported.

Marko Boskic, a Bosnian Serb thought to have carried out executions in the Srebrenica region, was found by federal agents in Massachusetts in 2004 and deported back to Bosnia.

He was sentenced to ten years in prison for crimes against humanity.

Federal officials say they have expelled 64 immigrants from the Balkans with ties to war crimes.

Recent cases against both Bosnian Serbs and Bosnian Muslims have seen atrocities such as rape, murder and arson.

Vermont's Edin Sakoc, 55, could face up to ten years in prison and be stripped of his US citizenship if his January conviction for lying about activities during the war are upheld on appeal.

Backlogs in immigration courts mean that some of those found eligible for deportation may not face decisions about whether they will actually be deported until 2019.

Immigration officials also face trouble building cases against suspected war criminals because agency's war crimes center was allotted just $65,000 last year for travel and translation expenses.

Lawyer Thomas M. Hoidal represented two of 12 Bosnian Serbs in Arizona who face deportation over war crimes. 'It's guilt by association,' he told the Times. 

The Bosnian war ended in a 1995 US-brokered peace deal, the Dayton Accords.

 A
UN tribunal subsequently ruled in 2004 that genocide was committed in
Bosnia.

The 20th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre will be marked on July 11, 2015.

US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement opened a war crimes section in 2008, which has investigated those linked to killings in El Salvador, Ethiopia, Guatemala and Rwanda.
