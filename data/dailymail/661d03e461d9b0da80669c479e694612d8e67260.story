You may think you’re making a healthy decision when opting for a bowl of cereal over a bacon sandwich but a new survey has uncovered the staggering amount of sugar in some of the most popular Australian brands.

Just Right, which is marketed as ‘low in salt. High in fibre. Goodness of wholegrain’ contains a shocking seven teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams.

It’s ‘healthy’ counterparts in the cereal aisle such as Nutri Grain contain eight teaspoons of sugar, while Sultana Bran and Be Natural Apple and Raisin Cereal both boast five and a half.

Kellogg's Sultana Bran contains five and a half teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams and Just Right has a shocking seven teaspoons 

Dieter's staple Special K, which is sold as '99% fat free', has 3.5 teaspoons of sugar but it has 490 mg of sodium, making it 'high' in salt. 

In fact, the average sugar content of all 20 cereals analysed by the Obesity Policy Coalition was 19.8g per 100g – that’s almost 20 per cent sugar, about five teaspoons of the dangerous ingredient. 

Children’s cereals are, less surprisingly, also packed full of sugar.

Chocolate covered Coco Pops which are advertised as ‘nutritious grains of puffed rice with cocoa’ contain a sickening nine teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams, as well as 465 mg of sodium.

While Fruit Loops boasts nine and a half teaspoons of sugar, despite being labelled promisingly as ‘no artificial flavours, no artificial colours’.

In the children's aisle, Nutri Grain contains eight teaspoons of sugar and colourful Fruit Loops has nine and a half

Frosties, which don't have any health claims, contain ten teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams – highlighting that they should probably only be eaten as a treat.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends no more than 10 per cent of a person's daily energy should come from free sugars - those that are added to processed foods and drinks, but also those found naturally in honey, syrups and fruit juices.

That equates to around 50g or 10 cubes a day - easily reached with a bottle of fizzy drink.

However, the UN agency advises that people aim for no more than five per cent - 25g or around six teaspoons - to achieve the biggest health benefits.

Yet many of us are consuming way in excess of this just in our first meal of the day – cereal.

Be Natural Apple and Raisin Cereal, which advertises itself as 'No artificial flavours, colours or preservatives', has five and a half teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams. Frosties, which don't have any health claims, contain ten teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams

The Obesity Policy Coalition (OPC) says its findings suggest Australian cereal manufacturers are potentially misleading consumers by promoting healthy sounding statements on their packaging despite sugar making up more than 35 per cent of the ingredients of some popular brands.

Executive Manager of the OPC Jane Martin said: ‘Many breakfast cereals contain high levels of sugar, but manufacturers use all sorts of creative phrases on their labels to give consumers the impression they’re a nutritious choice for breakfast. It’s as though they are prepared to tell consumers only half the story.

‘Many parents would be horrified to learn that for every three mouthfuls of Nutri-Grain, one is just sugar, while a small bowl contains twice as much sodium as a small packet of chips.’

Special K only has 3.5 teaspoons of sugar but it has 490 mg of sodium, making it 'high' in salt. Chocolate covered Coco Pops which are advertised as ‘nutritious grains of puffed rice with cocoa’ contain a sickening nine teaspoons of sugar per 100 grams, as well as 465 mg of sodium

Foods containing over 15 grams of sugar per 100 grams are considered 'high' in sugar

Cheerios are '69% wholegrain. No artificial colours or flavours' but contain five teaspoons of sugar. All Bran has three teaspoons of sugar

‘The Health Star Rating System was introduced more than a year ago to help consumers compare the overall nutritional quality of products at a glance. The system helps consumers better understand a product’s overall health rating so they can make informed choices, but our research has revealed very few cereals, as yet, carry the star label,’ Ms Martin said.

‘Clearer labelling through such a system is a vital step in helping consumers make healthier choices in an environment where approximately 63 per cent of Australian adults and 25 per cent of Australian children are overweight or obese.’

Foods containing over 15 grams of sugar per 100 grams are considered ‘high’ in sugar and or salt, a product with over 400mg of sodium per 100 grams is considered ‘high’ in salt.
