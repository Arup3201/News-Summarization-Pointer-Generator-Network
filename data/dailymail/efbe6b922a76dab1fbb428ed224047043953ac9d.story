A former lawyer has launched himself on a new high-flying career path – as a human cannonball.

Oxford graduate Gary Stocker, 30, had a £1million home and six-figure salary as a law writer and legal recruitment officer.

But he has left all that behind to live in a caravan with a travelling circus and perform as The Great Herrmann.

Mr Stocker set up Chaplin’s Circus with friend Mark Foot.

He has spent tens of thousands of pounds funding 20 performers and the purchase of a 1,400-seat circus tent – the largest in the UK.

He said: ‘Perhaps I only went to Oxford to please my mum – I realised that being in the circus was what I was destined for.

‘The circus is even harder than my previous jobs in terms of hours, but it brings freedom and variety.

‘It’s so exciting, and every day brings something new.’

Describing how he came to his life-changing decision, he said: ‘When I was in legal recruitment I got a really big sum of money one month.

‘Then my boss said to me “You’re going to make so much money you won’t be able to leave”.

‘That’s when I decided it was time to go. I couldn’t be enticed by the money as I knew it wasn’t what I really wanted to do.’

But it wasn’t until his friend Mr Foot, 30, a street performer, suggested joining him that he realised he was destined for a new kind of high-flying career.

‘When Mark put his proposal to me I realised that being in a circus was what I was destined for. I thought about his offer for all of 15 minutes before giving him a resounding “Yes”,’ he said.

‘My mum had always done her best to send me to the best schools and I presumed that she would be disappointed in me if I did not enter a profession, such as law or medicine. But I was totally wrong – she is proud of me whatever I choose to do.

Mr Stocker studied law at Oxford before landing a job at the London office of international legal recruitment consultancy Shilton Sharpe Quarry as an academic law writer and buying a house in Waterloo, central London.

His performances are based around a 1920s-themed show which tells the story of a circus on the brink of bankruptcy that is saved by an inventor who builds the world’s first human cannon.

‘People watching always think that I arrive in the net instantaneously. For me, however, it feels like an eternity,’ he said.

‘I am always afraid that something will go wrong and we will be caught out. We have had a couple of near misses but on the whole we have been lucky so far.’

Around 20 performers including jugglers, acrobats and tight-rope walkers take part in the show inside the tent, which has its first night in St Albans, Hertfordshire, on Saturday.
