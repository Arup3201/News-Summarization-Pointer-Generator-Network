Roy Hodgson's side travel to Turin in search of an eighth consecutive victory ahead of their international friendly date with Italy on Tuesday.

England continued their recovery from a disastrous World Cup by defeating lowly Lithuania 4-0 on Friday night to maintain a six-point lead at the top of Euro 2016 qualifying Group E.

The Azzurri will have learned who Harry Kane is after the Tottenham striker marked his debut with a goal after only 79 seconds, but who will be the players to watch out for from Antonio Conte's revamped side?

Eder (Sampdoria) 

Brazilian-born striker who admits he doesn't know the words to the Italian national anthem. Showed why Conte picked him with an outstanding debut goal to earn The Azzurri a 2-2 draw in Bulgaria on Saturday.

Graziano Pelle (Southampton) 

A firm Conte favourite despite failing to score a Premier League goal since December. Pelle is regarded highly for his hold-up play and linking with other players, a strength of the current Italian side.

Mirko Valdifiori (Empoli) 

Set for his Italian debut at nearly 29 after an impressive season for Serie A surprise package Empoli. Midfielder who is similar to Andrea Pirlo, the scourge of England in the past.

Franco Vazquez (Palermo) 

Argentine attacking midfielder who qualifies to play for Italy through his mother's nationality. His inclusion at 26 is a sign that, like England, Italy are struggling to find enough international-class players.
