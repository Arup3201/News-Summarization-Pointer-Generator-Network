Holland have set up a mouthwatering semi-final clash against Argentina after beating Costa Rica in a dramatic penalty shootout.

The Dutch brought Newcastle United goalkeeper Tim Krul on as a substitute in the dying seconds ofÂ  extra time.

And he proved the hero after saving two Costa Rica penalties, sparking wild celebrations in the Arena Fonte Nova stadium.

They will now face a tough task in the final four when they face Argentina who beat Belgium earlier today to advance.

Substitute goalkeeper goalkeeper Tim Krul, introduced just for the shootout, saved from Bryan Ruiz and Michael Umana as the Netherlands triumphed 4-3.

But Costa Rica had their own goalkeeper Keylor Navas to thank for keeping his team in the match with a string of first-half saves.

Wesley
 Sneijder had one of the best chances for the Dutch in the 80th 
minute, beating Navas with a free kick, but the shot hit the post.

Meanwhile, an investigation is underway 
after a Costa Rican fan was stabbed in the back as he watched the match 
on a giant screen at Democracy Square in San Jose, Costa Rica.

Holland had reached the quarter-finals following a dramatic 2-1 win over Mexico, equalising in the 88th minute before netting the winner in stoppage time.

Costa Rica edged past Greece 5-3 on penalties after drawing 1-1 in the last 16.

Earlier in the night, Argentina, led by superstar 
Lionel Messi, scored early thanks to a sweetly struck volley by striker 
Gonzalo Higuain and held on for victory at the Estadio Nacional in 
Brasilia.

The win came despite a scathing 
verbal attack by World Cup great Diego Maradona, who accused his 
national side of having 'no idea'.

Argentina 
limped past Switzerland in the last 16 after overcoming Ottmar 
Hitzfeld's team 1-0 in extra-time and faced even tougher European 
opponents tonight.

Belgium
 had overcame a stubborn USA side to advance to their first 
quarter-final since 1986 but needed a massive improvement on their poor 
finishing from that 2-1 extra-time victory to progress past one of the 
pre-tournamant favourites.

But Gonzalo Higuain opened the scoring after just eight minutes 
tonight when he swept a volley past Belgium's keeper Thibaut Courtois following 
swift footwork by Lionel Messi.

His superb strike was enough to send his side through to the last four for the first time in 24 years.

Belgium, whose best World Cup run was in 1986 when they were knocked out by Diego Maradona's Argentina in the semi-finals, had a couple of chances but otherwise offered little in attack despite sustained late pressure that set nerves among the thousands of Argentines thronging the giant arena jangling.

The Albiceleste remain unbeaten at the 
tournament, but had failed to impress with their performances on the way
 to the last eight.

The win 
came as it was revealed that Football great Alfredo Di Stefano was in 
'critical' condition in hospital after a heart attack, his Real Madrid 
club said on Saturday.

The
 88-year-old Di Stefano was in 'critical, serious' condition at Madrid's
 Gregorio Maranon Hospital, club spokeswoman Marta Santisteban said.

A
 spokeswoman for Madrid's emergency service Samur told the AP that an 
ambulance was called to attend Di Stefano at Juan Ramon Jimenez street, 
just north of the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium, at 5 pm.

She said paramedics found Di Stefano's heart had stopped beating and he
 had stopped breathing, but they managed to resuscitate him after 18 
minutes.

The
 former Argentina forward helped Madrid win five straight European 
Champions Cups from 1956-60 and eight Spanish league titles. He was 
voted European player of the year in 1957 and 1959.

He retired at the age
 of 40 in 1966, ending a 21-year-long playing career.

Madrid appointed Di Stefano honorary president in 2000 and named its new training complex after him six years later, with a statue erected in his honor in 2008.

Di Stefano underwent a quadruple aorta-coronary bypass with a pacemaker implanted in December 2005 after suffering a myocardial infarction.

And Diego Maradona, who captained the side to glory in 1986 and was coach in 2010, insisted before kick-off that they needed to improve.

'It seems to me that Argentina today has no idea,' he told AS. 'In the first half against Switzerland [in the round of 16] the team did not have one chance.'

In the 
second of tonight's clashes, Costa Rica take on Holland at the Arena 
Fonte Nova knowing that they need another incredible performance to get 
through.

In the build-up, Costa Rica coach Jorge Luis Pinto called on FIFA to clamp down on Arjen Robben's diving

Robben was heavily criticised after winning a penalty in Holland's last game against Mexico. After that game he admitted diving to win a free-kick earlier in the game.

Jorge Luis Pinto's side surprisingly blazed their way through Group D to make the last 16 for the first time since 1990, and a penalty shoot-out victory over Greece earned them the first quarter-final appearance in their history.

Meanwhile, FIFA's disciplinary committee is studying the challenge that led to Brazil's star player Neymar suffering a fractured vertebra to decide on action against Colombia's Juan Zuniga.

The Colombia defender caught Neymar with a knee in his back in a full-blooded challenge that went unpunished during Brazil's 2-1 quarter-final win.
