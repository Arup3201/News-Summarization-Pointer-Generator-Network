Controversial Italian MP Alessandra Mussolini has been slammed for signing images of her fascist dictator grandfather Benito during a corruption debate in parliament.

Mrs Mussolini, 49, who is an MP with former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's People of Freedom Party, was spotted by photographers autographing black and white photographs of her grandfather.

She had been given the pictures by fellow right wing politician Carolina Lussana in an envelope and asked to sign them for Lussana's friend.

Outrage: Alessandra Mussolini is pictured handing over a photo she has just signed of her grandfather fascist dictator Benito to a friend

One photo reportedly showed Benito Mussolini giving the straight arm Roman salute.

Lussana was heard requesting an autograph and for the famous granddaughter to make a dedication.

Centre left MPs immediately criticised Mrs Mussolini for her 'offensive actions' with Cesare Damiano of the Democratic Left saying: 'This is really beyond the pale and is unacceptable.

'It is an insult to the democratic institutions of our country.'

Unapologetic: Carolina Lusana, pictured right, says she does not understand why Alessandra Mussolini, left, has been criticised for signing a photo of Benito Mussolini

Flavio Arzarello, of the Italian 
Communist party, said: 'This episode involving Mussolini and Lussana is 
an insult to parliament and to our country.

'It's not as if the person in the picture is a famous footballer or pop star.

'No this was the person who suspended
democracy and who dragged Italy into a war along with Adolf Hitler, 
starving our population for 20 years. The speaker should have intervened
immediately.'

Today Mrs 
Mussolini, a former actress and model, was unrepentant and stormed: 'I 
really don't see what the problem is. It's my surname. He was my 
grandfather.'

Anger: Left-wing politicians have rounded on Alessandra Mussolini for her decision to sign images of the Fascist dictator

Miss Lussano, of the anti-immigration Northern League party, said: 'The pictures were for a friend of mine who is very interested in history.

'He is very interested in Mussolini and his granddaughter. I really don't see what the fuss is all about.'

It is not the first time that mother of three Mrs Mussolini has caused controversy - six years ago she hit out at transgender opposition MP Vladimir Luxoria saying: 'I'd rather be fascist than gay.'

Benito Mussolini's youngest son, jazz player Romano, was the father of Alessandra and the famous actress Sophia Loren is also her aunt.

Mussolini was in power from 1922 until 1943 when he was executed after being caught by partisans.

His body was hung upside down from a lamp post in Milan.

Technically it is against the law to have fascist symbols or memorabilia but there is a ready market in artefacts from the era and Mussolini's grave in Predappio near Forli has become a shrine for neo Fascists.
