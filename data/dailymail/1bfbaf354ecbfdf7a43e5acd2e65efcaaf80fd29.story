Court claim: Actress and Prince Andrew's former girlfriend Koo Stark, pictured recently, is believed to be pursuing News Corp in the U.S. courts for the first time

Prince Andrew's former girlfriend Koo Stark is threatening to sue Rupert Murdoch's media company, claiming that her phone was hacked while she was on US soil.

She is the first person to be confirmed as considering legal action against News Corp in the States over the hacking scandal, which has so far been largely confined to the UK.

If the contagion were to spread across the Atlantic it could prove highly damaging to Mr Murdoch.

'No proceedings have been issued either in America or here as yet but it could be a way forward,' a source close to the   55-year-old former actress said.

Single mother Miss Stark is a client of Mark Lewis, the solicitor representing many celebrities who have won damages against Mr Murdoch's now defunct newspaper the News of the World.

Mr Lewis is representing at least two other clients who may file civil lawsuits in the US over alleged phone-hacking by News Corp, which has its headquarters in New York.

Last night Mr Lewis would not comment on or discuss the case of American-born Miss Stark, who was declared bankrupt last year and splits her time between the US and UK.

Earlier this month, he said one of the alleged victims was connected to Princess Diana and the royal household, while a second has links to the England football team. The third was described as a 'Hollywood case' as the person was in touch with a celebrity, making him a target.

In an interview with US website The 
Daily Beast, Mr Lewis added that all of the numbers allegedly hacked 
were found in the notebooks of Glenn Mulcaire, the private detective 
employed by the News of the World.

Miss Stark dated Prince Andrew after his return from the Falklands War in the early 1980s, and marriage seemed on the cards.

But when it emerged that Miss Stark had acted in a mildly erotic film some years earlier, the romance ended.

She subsequently married Green Shield 
Stamps heir Tim Jefferies, while Andrew went on to wed Sarah Ferguson, 
but both marriages ended in divorce. However, Miss Stark and the Prince 
remain friends.
