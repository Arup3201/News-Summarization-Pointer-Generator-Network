Four government officials including Attorney General Eric Holder have spent more than $11 million of taxpayers' money being ferried around in luxury jets that are supposed to be used for counter-terrorism operations, a new report has revealed.

Holder, his predecessors Michael Mukasey and Alberto Gonzales, and FBI director Robert Mueller went on nearly 700 'non-mission' trips between 2007 and 2011 - with one of the aircraft being used for executive travel a third more than for actual missions.

The bulk of the flights - which cost an average of $16,285 - were taken on the FBI's two Gulfstream V jets, though the Citation CE-750 and the de Havilland Dash 8 100 were also used for non-mission travel, according to a Government Accountability Office report released on Thursday.

The Gulfstream costs just under $5,000 an hour to run, while the Citation costs around $3,700 an hour.

Nearly three-quarters of the flights were business related, for purposes like conferences, meetings and field office visits, while 24 per cent of travel was for personal reasons, most of which related to Holder's travel.

The officials were required to use government aircraft for security and safety reasons, and in some cases reimbursed the government for a portion of the expenses, for example $420.80 for a 2010 trip to New York that cost $15,894.

Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said given the hefty cost the officials should pass up the luxury Gulfstream V jets or reduce their air miles.

'These luxury jets were supposedly needed for counter-terrorism, but it turns out that they were used almost two-thirds of the time for jet-setting executive travel,' he said.

'Nobody disputes that the Attorney General and the FBI Director should have access to the secure communications, but, for instance, thereâ€™s no reason they can't take a less expensive mode of transportation, or cut their personal travel.'

The report says the jets are primarily there to accomplish and provide support for such things as transporting prisoners; preventing illicit drug trafficking into and within the United States; and conducting a variety of counter-terrorism, intelligence, and criminal surveillance activities.

The cost attributed to attorney general travel was $5.8 million while the FBI director's travel was almost as expensive at $5.6 million.

Non-mission travel: Travel by the Attorney General composed 53 per cent of the flights, while the FBI Director's composed 42 per cent. Around $1 million was spent ferrying other Department of Justice executives around, including the FBI's Deputy Director

Aircraft: The $5,000 an hour Gulfstream was used in 61 per cent of the officials' trips

Attorneys General and the FBI Director's travel constituted 95 per cent - 659 out of 697 flights - of all non-mission flights.

Travel by the Attorney General composed 53 per cent of the flights or 366 out of 697, while the FBI Director's travel composed 42 per cent or 293. Around $1 million was spent ferrying other Department of Justice executives around, including the FBI's Deputy Director.

Attorneys General took 56 per cent or 206 out of 366 flights for business reasons and 41 per cent - 151 out of 366 - for personal reasons, while the FBI Director took 97 per cent - 284 out of 293 - for business reasons and 2 per cent or 7 flights for personal reasons.

Officials provided reimbursements of the applicable full coach fare for their personal travel, though this amount is generally a fraction of the cost of a flight on the Gulfstream, the report said.

The FBI Director until 2011 was allowed to travel on commercial airlines for personal reasons and did regularly, while the Attorney General is required to fly the government's fleet for both business and personal travel.

Before many of the flights, the planes had to be flown from another location to Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington D.C. to pick up the officials and be flown back to their base once the trip was completed - something which added $1.5 million to the bill.

A quarter of the pricey 'non-mission' travel was personal, though the officials paid back a fraction of the cost on these occasions
