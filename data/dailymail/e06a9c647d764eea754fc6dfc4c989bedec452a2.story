A southwest Florida woman will now spend the rest of her life in prison after being found guilty of killing her autistic stepdaughter by gagging her so tightly the little girl became brain dead.

Misty Stoddard, 37, blinked away tears after a Sarasota jury took just two and a half hours to convict her of the first-degree murder of 11-year-old Melissa Stoddard on Friday.

Melissa died of suffocation in December 2012 after being tied to a wooden plank with her mouth duct-taped shut.

She had moved in with her father and his second wife - Misty - just five months earlier to escape her mothers abusive household in North Carolina.

Guilty: Misty Stoddard, 37 (left), has been convicted of the first-degree murder of her stepdaughter, Melissa Stoddard, 11 (right), after a jury found she tied the girl to a plywood sex board and taped her mouth shut

Key evidence: The defense claimed the wooden board - seen here from the bottom - Melissa Stoddard was tied to was purchased by her father so that he could practice sadomasochism with his wife

There she had been 'touched' by her brother, with her mother sending Melissa away for protection.

The wooden board was propped up in the courtroom near the jury throughout the trial and described as a 'home made torture device', The Herald-Tribune reported.

With holes drilled through the plank, the prosecution demonstrated how Melissa would be tied to the board each night.

The defense maintained Melissa's father, Kenneth Stoddard, created the board to act out sexual bondage fantasies with his wife.

Misty Stoddard said her husband would tie her up and abuse her against her will.

She said her DNA was found on the board as a result of the sexual acts.

The defense also claimed Melissa was only restrained twice and that it was because she had a tendency to become violent.

Misty Stoddard said she was worried what Melissa might do around her newborn child.

Melissa's stepmother Misty Stoddard (left) and her biological father, Kenneth Stoddard, have both been charged over the death. Kenneth Stoddard will stand trial on manslaughter charges in August

But the court was told Melissa's body was covered in injuries at the time of her death.

There was a black scab on her lower back, likely to have been caused by her attempts to break free from the board, and scars on her lips were consistent with being gagged.

'Parenting is hard and parenting an autistic child is harder. But parents do it every day,' Prosecutor Suzanne O'Donnell said.

'They don't kill their children.'

A woman who shared a cell with Stoddard for a few days testified against her, saying she confessed to duct-taping Melissa's mouth shut the night the child was rushed unresponsive to hospital.

A teacher at Melissa's school Oak Park School testified that he had notified a state agency anonymously in the weeks leading up to Melissa's death after becoming suspicious over what was happening at home.

Tragic: Melissa Stoddard was just 11-years-old when she died. She suffered from autism and loved to swim and sing

Melissa came to school with stitches above her eyebrow, however Misty Stoddard had emailed the school saying she had banged her head.

The teacher, Paul Squea, said Melissa had never hurt herself in class so heÂ  filed a child abuse report to the Florida Department of Children and Families' website.

Around the same time, a local social worker made an unnanounced visit to the Stoddard home to see why Melissa had been missing weeks of school.

Misty Stoddard wouldn't let the woman inside, instead speaking to her on the porch.

She had Melissa was out running errands with her father.

The social worker did not return to the house.

With the evidence stacked against, Stoddard's case that she was also a victim of absue and that Melissa's treatment was instigated by her husband did not stand up.

She was subsequently found guilty, and first-degree murder carries a mandatory life sentence in prison in Florida.

She was also convicted of aggravated child abuse, which carries a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison.

Kenneth Stoddard has been charged with manslaughter, aggravated battery and tampering with evidence.

He is scheduled to go on trial in August.
