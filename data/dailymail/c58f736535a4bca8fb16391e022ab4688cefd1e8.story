British Gas bosses were subjected to a Twitter tirade yesterday as they battled to justify a punishing 9.2 per cent price rise that will add £123 a year to the average dual-fuel energy bill.

Customer services director Bert Pijls was on the wrong end of an hour of non-stop abuse during a question and answer session that some described as a ‘car crash’.

He went on the social networking site in an attempt to counter negative reaction to the price rise.

Mr Pijls insisted the company had no choice but to put up bills in the face of the rising cost of wholesale energy and green taxes.

But one Twitter user posted a picture of an old woman wrapped in blankets and huddled next to a heater, writing: ‘Do images like this help you sleep at night, Bertie?’

Lee Vincent wrote: ‘Hi Bert, which items of furniture do you, in your humble opinion, think people should burn first this winter?

Felicity Morse asked: ‘Have you found a way to channel angry customer feedback into electricity?’

British Gas, which supplies 7.8million homes, announced a 10.4 per cent rise in electricity prices and 8.4 per cent for gas, to take effect on November 23.

Its dual-fuel customers will see their average annual bill rise by £123 to £1,444 after the increases, according to figures from regulator Ofgem. But regional variations in prices mean some customers will see their bills top £1,500 a year.

Twitter storm: British Gas customer services director Bert Pijls was subjected to a torrent of abuse on the social media website Twitter during an online Q&A

Enraged: While twitter uses were angry about what they saw as rip off charges they were also able to see the funny side of the social media gaffe

Britain’s biggest energy supplier said
at least £50 of the price rise can be blamed on green taxes and other 
measures imposed by the Government.

But
this was denied by ministers, and David Cameron hit back by urging 
customers to switch away from the company over the ‘very disappointing’ 
increase.

Critics condemned 
the increase as a ‘disgrace’ and said it was a betrayal of pensioners 
and families who face a nightmare choice between heating and eating this
winter.

The price rise 
follows an 8.2 per cent increase by SSE last week, while the other big 
energy suppliers are expected to follow suit.

British
Gas saw profits rise by 11 per cent last year to £606million. More 
significantly, profits at its parent company, Centrica, which makes 
money from North Sea gas and power generation, surged 14 per cent to 
£2.7billion.

Ian Peters, managing director of residential supplies for the company, insisted he had no choice but to raise prices.

‘What’s
pushing up energy prices at the moment are costs that are not all 
directly under our control, such as the global price of energy, charges 
that we have to pay for using the national grid that delivers energy to 
the home, and the cost of the Government’s social and environmental 
programmes,’ he said.

British
Gas put much of the blame for the price rise on green subsidies for 
wind farms and new nuclear power stations and the ECO – Energy Company 
Obligation – scheme. This involves raising money through bills to 
provide free insulation to the homes of the poor.

It wants the cost shifted to general taxation, saying this ‘would lower the average annual dual fuel bill significantly’.

But Energy Secretary Ed Davey said British Gas should carry the can for higher bills, not the Government.

He
suggested the company’s figures about the cost of running the ECO 
scheme were bogus saying, they ‘just don’t add up’. Last night Energy 
Minister Greg Barker admitted the energy price rises were tantamount to 
‘robbery’.

Asked on Channel 4 News if customers were being robbed he said: ‘Absolutely, which is why we are doing something about it.

‘We’ve
made it easier to switch, we’ve made bills easier to read and 
encouraged people to penalise the big six by voting with their feet and 
going to another supplier.

Online gaffe: Twitter users responded by bombarding British Gas customer services director Bert Pijls with lots of questions relating to directors pays and bonuses

‘By
freezing the bills you kill the independents [firms] who bring choice 
and competition to the market.’ Caroline Flint, Labour’s energy 
spokesman, said: ‘Even the government minister can see this price rise 
today is unfair to customers, but would not refer the rise to the 
Competition Commission. We don’t have to, we’ve promised to freeze the 
bills.’

High energy bills 
have risen to the top of the political agenda following a promise by the
Labour leader Ed Miliband to freeze prices if the party wins power at 
the 2015 general election.

The Prime Minister said: ‘I think it is a very disappointing announcement by British Gas.

‘There is something everyone can do, which is look to switch their electricity or gas bill from one supplier to another.

‘On
average, this can help people save sometimes as much as £200 on their 
bill. So I would encourage customers who are not happy to go to the 
switching sites online and see whether they can get a better deal.’

A Downing Street spokesman suggested the Government would investigate ways to make it easier to switch,

John
Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: 
‘Today’s British Gas increase at three times the rate of inflation is a 
disgrace.

Ill advised: Some twitter users pointed out it might have been a bad idea to hold an online Q&A the same day the company hiked prices

‘It is going to 
hit many households hard at a time when they simply cannot afford it. 
More than 40 per cent of small businesses are with British Gas and 
energy price rises are going to make the cost of doing business even 
higher.’

Gillian Guy, chief
executive at Citizens Advice, called on other suppliers to hold prices.
‘Now is the time for energy firms to show an understanding of the 
day-to-day lives of their customers and put a freeze on further price 
rises this winter,’ she said.

Richard Lloyd, executive director of consumer group Which?, said more action is needed.

‘We want the Government to intervene to make sure everything possible is done to keep prices in check,’ he said.

Consumers
can protect themselves against price rises by switching to fixed rate 
deals, some of which guarantee not to raise tariffs until 2017.

For
example, First Utility has a tariff fixed until January 2016 with an 
average annual bill of £1,274.06, while EDF Energy has a fixed deal 
charging an average of £1,339.70 until March 2017.
