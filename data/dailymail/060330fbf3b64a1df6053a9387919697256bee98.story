Owen Farrell is 23. It is worth emphasising that point, because he is often wrongly perceived as a seasoned veteran and that is not helping him.

Four years ago, he was on loan at Bedford, in the Championship. Now, he has played 28 Tests for England, represented the Lions and – as befitting an accelerated career path – finds his international credentials being cast into doubt.

Amid the rush to lambast the Saracens fly-half for his poor form on England duty last month, it is appropriate to consider the context. Firstly, he was a victim of circumstances beyond his control. Secondly, he will feature prominently at next year’s World Cup, providing he is not injured.

Without doubt, Farrell was off-colour at Twickenham, during the defeats against New Zealand and South Africa. Without doubt, he deserved to be dropped to the bench – if not further – for the series-ending victory over Australia, following a hit-and-miss shift at inside centre against Samoa. But to write him off would be ludicrous. 

As a dogged competitor, he will relish vying with his good friend, George Ford, for the England No 10 shirt that he has lost, for now.

Mark McCall, Saracens’ director of rugby, has defended his man, by claiming that Farrell was ‘rusty’ going into the November campaign. That is a colossal under-statement. After a month out injured, he had played one full and unconvincing match before earning an immediate England recall.

The bottom line is that he should not have been picked to face the All Blacks. He wasn’t ready. As McCall said: ‘He played one 80 minutes and was asked to face New Zealand, which is a pretty tough ask.’ Another under-statement. In fact, it was an impossible task.

Stuart Lancaster and his assistants needed an alternative plan, but they didn’t feel they had a viable one to fall back on. Ford had missed the summer tour of New Zealand, so he hadn’t been exposed to the furnace-heat of a Test match in the balance. Freddie Burns and Danny Cipriani had deputised well, but neither had been included in the senior squad in late October.

The extenuating circumstances went further back. First, Charlie Hodgson retired from Tests and then Toby Flood decided that a move to Toulouse was more appealing than playing second fiddle to the rookie. So the safety net had been removed.

In lieu of genuine experience, Farrell assumed the mantle of the veteran in his position, despite his relative youth. Time and time again, Lancaster was forced to consider the doomsday threat of being forced to find a replacement, and that unwelcome scenario came to pass last month.

Ford seized his opportunity with aplomb. He played flat to the line and showed his ability to unlock defences with astute distribution, tactical kicking, pace and footwork. Farrell does not have all those attributes in his repertoire, but neither did Jonny Wilkinson and it didn’t stop him becoming the country’s iconic, World Cup-winning hero.

Like Wilkinson, Farrell is a ‘Test match animal’. In a position often populated by more delicate artists, he is made of steel, with a warrior spirit and armed with cold composure as a supreme goal-kicker, despite the competitive fire that rages within.

What he needs now is game after game after game at fly-half for Saracens, to rediscover his missing sharpness, while further honing his efforts to feel at home playing flat to the line. It may actually help him that Ford has earned Lancaster’s trust, as it reduces the risk that he will be assessed differently to others.

To start a Test, he must be ready; fully fit and playing well. At the age of 23, he is no veteran. He cannot slot back into the old routine without preparation. Farrell will be an international match-winner again, of that there can be no doubt, but England have learned the hard way that he needs to be handled with care, like all their other assets. 

Irish rugby is on a roll. Amid the after-glow of a triumphant autumn campaign for Joe Schmidt’s national team, the country’s union – with government backing – will today outline plans to host the 2023 World Cup. On the field, Ireland will surely go into the Six Nations as favourites to defend their title after beating South Africa, convincingly, and Australia last month. 

Their prospects at next year’s World Cup appear increasingly bright. Yet, the audacious 2023 hosting plan may be doomed, despite being a united north-south bid, and even allowing for potential use of Gaelic sports venues, including the towering Croke Park in Dublin. 

The USA may enter the fray and global rugby authorities will be desperate to open up that huge market, while South Africa, Italy and Argentina are all thought to be interested.

 The 2011 tournament in New Zealand generated modest revenue and England are having to make up the short-fall with the lucrative 2015 extravaganza. 

Twickenham is drowning in logos and general commercial over-load in the increasing effort to maximise profits. 

To avoid such a scenario again, the chance of smaller nations being awarded the hosting rights have surely faded to nothing. 

In the modern era of meticulous professionalism, there is still room for the primal, powerful concept of motivation by irritation. 

Sale have been irked by Saracens’ attitude ahead of tomorrow’s European Champions Cup clash in Salford. 

Steve Diamond, their fiery director of rugby, said: ‘We’ve been written off. Saracens have already openly stated on TV after their defeat at Munster that they will pick the bonus points up against Sale.

It was one of the players who showed it to me and it is being used as a little tool.’ 

One Sale player suggested that Saracens are known for being ‘arrogant’ and that the hosts will be fired-up to make a mockery of their rivals’ perceived superiority complex. 

It is shaping up to be a feisty, niggly, abrasive encounter. 

Quote of the week 

Leicester’s director of rugby, Richard Cockerill, was on vintage comedy form as he reflected on Tom Croft’s delayed return to action after injury, saying: ‘Crofty was in the 23 last weekend, but his wife decided to have a baby. 

Leicester's director of rugby Richard Cockerill was in hilarious form talking about Tom Croft becoming a dad

'He’s a proud dad of Victoria. It took long enough – started Friday and finished Saturday afternoon! 

'For some reason they wanted to have the baby at the General hospital rather than the Royal Infirmary (close to Welford Road), so he couldn’t even pop across the road to play, then pop back again. 

'That’s the reason they built the hospital there!’ 

Last Word 

England and Wales players will hurl themselves into European club combat this weekend, their bodies still shattered from four Tests in succession last month. 

It is too much of a strain. The clubs cannot be blamed for picking their leading men for key continental fixtures which could make or break their season – especially as they have been without those players since late October. 

Twelvetrees (second right) and his England team-mates should have an extra break after their exertions

By and large, the club directors of rugby and coaches demonstrate a commendable desire to manage the work-load of their internationals. 

The stark fact is that four Tests in November is excessive and is driven by financial considerations. It requires the IRB, or World Rugby – as they now wish to be known – to strictly regulate the congested calendar. 

Each European nation should play two Tests against leading southern-hemisphere countries and one against a Tier Two side every autumn, before an obligatory rest week for all players involved. Less games = less injuries = a better product. Rocket science, it most certainly isn’t…

He needs to rediscover his match sharpness with Saracens game time
