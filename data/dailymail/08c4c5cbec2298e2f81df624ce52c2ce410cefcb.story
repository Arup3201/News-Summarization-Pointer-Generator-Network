West Ham and Tottenham are set to lock horns in the summer pursuit of Everton striker Romelu Lukaku.

Lukaku hinted strongly last week that he was ready to quit Goodison Park just one season after his £28million summer move from Chelsea.

He even suggested he would like to return to the Blues. That won't happen.

Chelsea are instead interested in West Ham's Enner Valencia.

And if Valencia quits Upton Park the Hammers will be in the market for Lukaku and could afford his £30m fee with wages at around £60,000 a week.

Spurs have lined up West Brom's Saido Berahino but if Lukaku is up for grabs then they would change their tact and take on the Hammers.

Atletico Madrid and Juventus are two other possible destinations.

Liverpool will subtly try and convince Danny Ings that they are the club for him when he leaves Burnley as a free agent this summer.

Ings is able to talk to foreign clubs and it has been reported that he has flown out for talks with Real Sociedad.

Sociedad boss David Moyes is hoping to secure 22-year-old Ings on a pre-contract worth £60,000-a-week and a significant signing on fee.

Liverpool are capable of rewarding him well too but they can't officially approach the player until the summer unless they strike a deal with Burnley which would involve some form of fee.

Louis van Gaal has insisted that Angel di Maria is part of Manchester United's future.

But it is understood the Argentine is ready to quit Old Trafford this summer and move to PSG despite being recently quoted that he is 'happy' at United.

PSG are the club Di Maria wanted to join last summer when he was off loaded by Real Madrid.

But complications with regard to FFP regulations prevented the French club completing a £55 million deal.

The French club had targeted Chelsea's Eden Hazard for this summer.

The Belgian recently signed a new five-and-a-half-year deal with the Blues and PSG will move in for Di Maria who has not settled into the United team.

United now look as though they will not take up their option to sign Radamel Falcao, on loan from Monaco, on a permanent deal.

Falcao could return to the south of France although there is a possibility of a trade with PSG to bring Uruguayan front man Edinson Cavani to Old Trafford. 

Eden Hazard put pen to paper on a new deal to keep him at Chelsea for the foreseeable future

Tim Sherwood turned down the offer of managing QPR last week to pave the way for succeeding Paul Lambert as Aston Villa boss.

Villa confirmed the Sherwood deal on Saturday after sacking Lambert.

It had appeared Sherwood was a shoo-in to replace Harry Redknapp at Rangers and talks had taken place.

But Sherwood had some reservations given the potential financial punishments from the Football League the club could face if they are relegated, plus the risk of a decaying squad.

There was also the issue of seemingly being seen as part of a 'consipiracy' to oust Redknapp given Sherwood's close relationship with QPR's director of football Les Ferdinand, both of whom worked under Redknapp at Tottenham.

And as soon as the Villa job became vacant Sherwood, who despite only a short stint as Tottenham boss has suddenly become managerial 'hot property', saw a better route to establish himself in football management.

Despite woeful recent form Villa have a far stronger squad than Rangers and Sherwood is confident he can steer the club out of the relegation zone.

It is understood Glenn Hoddle, who quit as QPR coach when Redknapp resigned, could work as a part-time assistant with Sherwood at Villa Park.

Meanwhile Chris Ramsey, who has been given the Rangers job until the end of the season, believes he can do the job on a permanent basis, but that will only happen if he steers QPR to survival.

Ramsey though has been told he still has a long-term role at the club

West Brom, who missed out on Carlton Cole on transfer deadline day, will move for the West Ham striker again this summer.

But if Bournemouth secure promotion they will also chase Cole, who suddenly has a role to play again with the Hammers given that Andy Carroll is out of action for the rest of the season.

The Baggies are also keen on West Ham's Matt Jarvis.

I am also hearing...

Tottenham, in a bid for long-term stability and success have already tied Harry Kane and Ryan Mason down to new, lucrative contracts, and expect to secure the services of 20-year-old Algerian midfielder Nabil Bentalab soon.

Nabil Bentaleb has been a regular for Mauricio Pochettino's exciting Tottenham side

It was great to catch up with Trevor Brooking last week.

Sir Trev was guest of honour in Collier Row, Romford at a dinner held by Chabad Lubavitch Centres, a fine Jewish charity which works across the board in north east London and Essex communities to help those people who have lose their way in the world due to addictions and family issues.

As ever tales of yore had guests transfixed during a Q&A.

I had to ask Trevor which goal was his favourite, the one for England vs Hungary which  ensured qualification for the 1982 World Cup, a solo winner in West Ham's epic 3-1 Cup Winners' Cup semi final win over Eintracht Frankfurt or his headed winner in the 1980 FA Cup final.

Not surprisingly he plumped for the latter even though I tried to convince him about the goal against Frankfurt, which was a classic game in the mud which you no longer see.

Trevor was pretty open in some of his answers but understandably was coy about the real reason from his departure as The FA's technical director.

My understanding was that after 10 years he got rather fed up of making suggestions based on football reasons, and eventually saw the commercial imperative take priority and a new breed of clip board coaches take over at the core of the FA coaching staff.

In the latest restructuring at Wembley HQ there is a man called Dan Ashworth who never played the game professionally but who is in charge of the FA's Elite Development based at St. George',s a role which effectively rendered Brooking's position redundant.

No doubt Ashworth's sports science CV ticks all the right boxes but when there are so many ex-pros with coaching credentials AND streetwise savvy it still seems a strange appointment.

Certainly the workings of this new department would seem in need of urgent scrutiny given that on Friday night England's Under 17s (full of PL academy players) lost 7-0… yes seven… to Holland in a tournament in the Algarve.

Premier League supremo Richard Scudamore was right when he said football clubs are not charities.

But they are a massive part of their local communities.

And he should remember in hard times local communities have usually clubbed together, dug deep into their pockets, to bail out clubs in financial crisis and offered their own form of charity to save clubs from going to the wall.

It's not just smaller professional or non-League clubs where this happens. So while at the moment the plight of Hereford might not seem of consequence to the people at the top of the game (but it should) let's not forget that one of the Premier League's fat cat's Chelsea had to set up the 'Save the Bridge Fund' to keep it afloat in the Eighties and Nineties.

Indeed as a consequence of that the commendable Chelsea Supporters Trust still has an influential voice at the club.

The Premier League will continue to be shown on Sky Sports and BT Sport until 2019 in a £5.136bn deal

And they, along with other similar groups, will argue that following the massive increase in TV rights revenues announced by the Premier League last week the time has come for top clubs not just to freeze ticket prices but reduce them.

The fact prices have become so high means that the 'normal working man' and many youngsters just haven't been able to afford to attend.

They have in effect become the TV customers rather than in-stadia supporters.

But the game is in danger of losing a generation of fans who are used to turning up at matches and down the line grounds with empty seats is not good for business. Not so much in terms of revenue but creating the event and making the atmosphere that makes the Premier League so attractive to TV at home and abroad.

So cutting prices would not be an act of a charity but an investment in the long-term future of the game or in PL parlance the 'product.'

Richard Scudamore agreed a huge television deal and said that Premier League clubs are not charities

It's getting to that time when people will start talking about who should be the PFA Player of the Year.

It would seem to me Sky Bet are calling it right at the moment with Cesc Fabregas 3-1 fav.

Eden Hazard and Alex Sanchez are 11-2, Diego Costa is is 4-1 and Sergio Aguero is 11-2.
