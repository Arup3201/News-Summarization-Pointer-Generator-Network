The Swedish man who perfected his poker skills while he trained to be a chef is $10 million richer after winning the top World Series of Poker main event prize last night.

Martin Jacobson, 27, had three tens to beat Felix Stephensen of Norway and his pair of nines in the Las Vegas tournament.

As confetti blasts signalled his win and his friends and family ran to embrace him, Jacobson said: 'There's no such thing as a 'perfect tournament,' but this was close to perfect, maybe.'

Jacobson's mother Eva said her son started playing poker after coming home late from restaurant shifts, as none of his friends were awake to chat or hang out.  

He was the only player of the final nine to have earned more than $1 million in World Series of Poker career earnings at tournaments, but had never won the top spot.  

Jacobson exhibited a calm stillness throughout the two days of poker playing, and didn't hide himself behind sunglasses, a hoodie or a baseball cap like other players. 

Instead he often stared at his opponents across the table blinking through black-rimmed glasses.

This wasn't Jacobson's first try at the big win. He travelled to Las Vegas, days after he turned 21, to enter the main event. But he busted out after a few hands.

'I think that was good for him,' Eva said in the lobby of the Penn & Teller Theater at the Rio while her son amassed more chips on stage inside. He learned it wasn't going to be an easy task, she said.

Jacobson's opponent, Stephensen, 24, took home $5.1 million for second place.

Stephensen said: 'It's disappointing to be so close, but I got really lucky to get this far, and it was a tough final table.'

The two defeated Jorryt van Hoof, the leader throughout most of the game play, to go head-to-head.

Van Hoof, a poker pro originally from the Netherlands, had an icy stare and a formidable chip lead against two other European players going into last night's final table in the World Series of Poker.

All have been vying for the $10 million top prize and a coveted World Series of Poker gold bracelet.

Van Hoof, who wore a pair of sunglasses as he played, lost his lead, couldn't regain it, and finally lost after three hours of gameplay with a pair of fives to a pair of tens.

But the 31-year-old still took home $3.8 million for coming third.

The Dutch pro, who has his own poker coaching business and is known for his cold stare, said he wore sunglasses because of the 'bright studio lights'. 

Van Hoof also didn't just have a cheering section making creative use of his name ('Van Hoof, van Hoof, van Hoof is on fire,' they chanted). He had an entire team of friends and coaches analyzing spreadsheets, the table play and the half-hour delayed ESPN live broadcast. All that information was given to a captain, of sorts, who would then filter it to van Hoof.

It was the first time in the World Series of Poker's history that the final three players in the no-limit Texas Hold 'em main event didn't include a single American.

All three players live in London.

'I enjoyed playing with these guys,' van Hoof said. 'We're going to meet up. And the winner will pay for my dinner.'

They outlasted six other finalists during 12 hours of gameplay Monday night and into Tuesday morning and began playing no-limit Texas Hold 'em again Tuesday night.

Van Hoof had a third more chips than Jacobson and nearly double the total of Stephensen going into the final face-off.

The main event, culminating this week, is just one World Series of Poker event but certainly the most watched.

About 6,700 people paid the $10,000 entry fee to try their luck over the summer to be finalists in the Texas Hold 'em main event.
