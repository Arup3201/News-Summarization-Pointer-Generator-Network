Chelsea players prepared for Tuesday night's Capital One Cup semi-final against Liverpool by training on the banks of the river Mersey.

Manager Jose Mourinho shuffled off as players including Oscar, Diego Costa and Willian were taken through some stretching exercises in front of surprised locals.

In what appeared to be freezing conditions, the session doesn't last very long before the group, heavily wrapped in winter clothing, trudged off in the direction of their manager.

The Blues will be renewing their rivalry with the red half of Merseyside, which has history of producing memorable moments in cup competitions including the Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup over the last decade.

The first-leg tie has been spiced up after Liverpool winger Lazar Markovic hit back at Mourinho for not signing him when he had the chance.

Markovic joined Liverpool from Benfica for £20million during the summer's transfer window but could have easily ended up at Stamford Bridge for half price had the Portuguese manager fancied buying the 20-year-old.

'He said I'm not good enough? That's Mourinho's opinion,' said the Serbia international.

Meanwhile, Mourinho claims he chose not to sign Manchester United forwards Radamel Falcao or Angel di Maria last summer because their huge salaries would've 'caused an explosion' at Chelsea.

Falcao moved to Old Trafford on a season-long loan from Monaco, while Di Maria sealed a British record £60million transfer from Real Madrid. 

But Mourinho, who insists he didn't want either player, cited the effect of their wages on his dressing room when explaining why he passed up the opportunity to sign them.

In new book The Key to Mendes, Mourinho said: 'I can't have a player earning €10m when others earn three, four or five. That would have caused an explosion.'
