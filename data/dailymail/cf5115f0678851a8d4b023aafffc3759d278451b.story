Wayne Rooney showed impressive skills of diplomacy by saying he is backing Holland to win the World Cup now that England have been knocked out.

Holland coach Louis van Gaal is taking over as Manchester United manager after the World Cup and Rooney did not hesitate when asked which team he would like to win the tournament now.

He said, with a deadpan face: 'Holland.'

He added: 'It's a fantastic tournament to be a part of and I'm disappointed to be going out, but I'll watch from home - I'm a football fan.'

Rooney welcomed Van Gaal's appointment last month saying on Twitter: 'Great to see Louis Van Gaal has been named @ManUtd manager. Looking forward to working with him.'

There are other reasons Rooney would choose the orange cause - not least that his fellow United striker Robin van Persie is also the Holland skipper.
