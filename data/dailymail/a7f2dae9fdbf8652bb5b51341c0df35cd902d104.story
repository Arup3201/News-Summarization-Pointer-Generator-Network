When Matthew Hawksley made it to the finish line of the triathlon at Mullaghmore, Co Sligo, Ireland, it was the the final victory in a a fight for life that began in that very town three years earlier.

For in the same chilly North Atlantic waters that the 26-year-old raced rival athletes, he had in 2011 broken his neck after diving from a 15ft pier into water just 3 feet deep.

But that was just the start of a journey that saw him cheat death eight times and fight his way back from what doctors told him would be a lifetime of paralysis.

You saved my life: Matthew Hawksley meets Fiona Hillary for the first time since she resuscitated him eight times after he leapt from a 15ft pier into just three feet of water and broke his neck in Mullaghmore, Co Sligo

'I am incredibly proud that I got back here': Mr Hawksley and Ms Hillary were introduced as they prepared for the swimming leg of a triathlon in the very same waters where he nearly lost his life three years ago

Mr Hawksley spent five weeks in a coma after the accident, only to contract MRSA in the hospital then develop pneumonia.

Doctors told him he would never walk again. Then, after being sent home he was struck down by testicular cancer and only got the all clear after his right testicle was removed.

Incredibly, not only did he fight his way back from paralysis, and overcome his cancer, he has regained a level of fitness that most people who have never felt the sharp end of a surgeon's scalpel would envy.

Lifesavers: Angela Dunne and her husband Finbar, who were just 10m away when Mr Hawksley had his accident. Their calls for help drew the attention of Ms Hillary who gave him CPR to keep his heart beating

The triumphant return to Mullaghmore brought Mr Hawksley face to face with the lifesavers who helped bring him back from the brink four times within 30 minutes when his heart failed and water filled his lungs.

He met Angela Dunne and her husband Finbar, who were only 10 metres away when he took his life-changing dive. Their calls for help drew the attention of Fiona Hillary, 41, who gave Mr Hawksley CPR after rushing to the scene.

Mr Hawksley and Ms Hillary had not met until they were introduced as they stood side-by-side on the beach preparing for the gruelling swim.

Ms Hillary, a nurse in Dublin's Beaumont Hospital who was visiting her boyfriend on the day of the accident, told Mr Hawksley: 'Your heart stopped down on the beach and we worked on you.

'We got you back to a faint heart rate, and it stopped again and we got you back again. We were determined we were going to hold on to you. I am delighted you don't remember any of it.

'You did cause a bit of trouble along the way. Your heart was very unstable. You were cold. Your blood-sugar was down.

'I am so glad you don't remember any of it. But you ruined a week of my life I was so upset with what happened to you.'

Where it all began: Mr Hawksley stands at the spot where he broke his neck in June 2011

Mr Hawksley completed his 350m swim and 5km run in one hour and 25 minutes.

He was forced to drop out of the bike ride after his mountain bike did not arrive from his home in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, in time.

After the event on Saturday, Mr Hawksley also walked down to the spot where he fell. The low tide revealed that instead of falling on rocks, as he originally thought, he had in fact smashed into sand.

Mr Hawksley said: 'I feel quite emotional in a really good way. I have shed a tear or two. I am incredibly proud that I got back here to take part in the triathlon within three years.

'For Fiona, who was resuscitating me the last time she saw me, to see me doing as well as I am makes me intensely proud of what I have done.'
