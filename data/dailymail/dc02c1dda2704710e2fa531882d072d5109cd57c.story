Apple is believed to be preparing to unveil its iWatch alongside a new update to its TV box allowing it to download apps at an event in June announced today.

The annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) will be held in San Francisco from June 2nd.

It is expected boss Tim Cook will unveil the much anticipated iWatch concept, which is believed to have health tracking capabilities.

Apple fan and artist Martin Hajek created these incredible lifelike mockups of an iWatch, whcih he believes could come in two version, with the top of the range being the iWatch S, which has a metal body and leather strap

Martin Hajek also believes Apple will release a lower cost plastic version of the watch, which will come in several different colours

Speculation around Apple's iWatch began at the end of 2012 and a rumoured release date was initially set for the fourth quarter of 2013.

Chinese websites reported in December 2012 that the computer giant was working with chip-maker Intel on a wrist-worn gadget.

It was said to have a 1.5inch screen and use Bluetooth to communicate with other devices, including an iPhone.

Other
 rumours suggest the iWatch will feature Siri voice controls that let 
users dictate messages, rather than use the tiny screen.

The watch could also be used as a remote control to change music tracks or pause video, on the phone or tablet.

In July last year, reports in the Financial Times said Apple was hiring outside help to tackle design problems with its iWatch. 

Apple has refused to hint at what announcement will be made.

'We have the most amazing developer community in the world and have a great week planned for them,' said Philip Schiller, Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing.

'Every year the WWDC audience becomes more diverse, with developers from almost every discipline you can imagine and coming from every corner of the globe.

'We look forward to sharing with them our latest advances in iOS and OS X so they can create the next generation of great apps.'

The conference, aimed at app developers, WWDC will feature more than 100 technical sessions, and over 1,000 Apple engineers will attend to offer help.

In previous years, the company has unveiled major new versions of its iOS and OS X software for Macs at the event, as well as new iPhones - although the firm is not expected to unveil these until September this year.

However, Apple fans have not waited for the announcement, and many have released stunning new images of what they believes Apple's iWatch could look like.

The latest images reveal two models, a luxury iWatch S with a metal case and leather strap, and a plastic iWatch C.

The incredibly realistic images were mocked up by artist and Apple fan Martin Hajek, and even show how the timepiece would look in Apple''s retail stores.

The incredibly detailed mockups even reveal how the watch could be displayed in Apple's stores

The mockups are Hajek's second attempt at an iWatch, having worked with Mac User magazine for the first.

'Right after Apple launched the colorful iPhone 5C I figured it would be nice to have a look at adding color to my original iWatch concept,' he said.

'I added some color, simplified the design and basically turned it into an iPhone 5C for around your wrist.'

The latest rumours around the secret smartwatch claim Apple has hired a raft of medical and sleep experts to work on its iWatch project, it has been claimed.

It is believed the watch will be able to monitor both exercise and sleep, letting wearers track and analyse their every movement.

Although the firm has refused to confirm it is even working on a watch, experts believe it could be released this year.

The iWatch c would match Apple's iPhone 5c perfectly

9to5Mac reported that Roy J.E.M. Raymann -- whose background includes working on wearables, sensors and non-pharmacological methods of improving sleep quality -- has joined Apple from Philips Research.

the firm is also believed to be developing a special app called HealthBook that will be built into the next version of its iOS software, allowing users to track and analyse the data their gadget collect.

The firm's iPhone 5S already has a movement tracking chip, called the M5, which is expected to be used in the iWatch.

Reports in the New York Times claim the first-generation smartwatch will be charged wirelessly, using existing technologies currently used with select smartphones and cases.

Yet future models of the wrist-worn technology may even be powered by solar or kinetic energy to make sure they never lose charge.

Solar panels could be fitted underneath the display of the iWatch, for example, and harness the sun's energy.

The watch imagined by Hajek has a square screen, while it believed the rear could have sensors to monitor a wearer's health.

Hajek even revealed some advertising concepts he thought Apple could use for the iWatch

Casio,
 for example, already uses solar technology in its G-Shock range of 
watches that can receive thermal and electrical energy and use it to 
recharge watch batteries through solar panels on the face of the watch.

This is further supported by the fact that in September, Apple posted a job vacancy looking for someone with solar expertise.

Other rumours state the watch will have a curved screen and run the next-generation of Apple software, likely to be called iOS 8.

All these current claims back up the plans laid out in an Apple patent filed in 2011.

The patent described a 'wearable accessory device' with a 'flexible display' that could use the same technology as a child's slap wrap to mount a flexible touchscreen on a user's wrist.

It also detailed a method in which the battery life could be extended, including a 'solar panel array spread across a surface of the accessory device', or 'a kinetic power source similar to those found on some wristwatches.'

Other watchmakers, including Casio, already use solar technology in their products. For example, the Casio G-Shock, pictured, can receive thermal and electrical energy and use it to recharge watch batteries through solar panels on the face of the watch

'An accessory device designed to be worn 
on a leg or arm could greatly benefit from this sort of power 
generation, and could lengthen the amount of time between charging,' the
 application continued.

Similarly, a patent filed in 2009 
detailed how Apple wanted to harness kinetic energy from the movement of
 an arm or leg as the wearer was walking. 

The
 curved screen and design rumours were bolstered by a further patent, awarded
 last year, which gave Apple the option to install a flexible battery 
into future products.

Last week, reports claimed Samsung was also looking at adding a curved screen to its own next-generation smartwatch, dubbed Galaxy Gear 2. 

The original watch launched in September last year and was heavily criticised for its chunky design and poor battery life.

Elsewhere, other rumours state the watch will have a curved screen, similar to the concept images pictured, and run the next-generation of Apple software, likely to be called iOS 8

Some analysts claimed the device was 
rushed out to make sure it was one of the first on the market, beating 
Apple and Google to their respective rumoured devices. 

Whereas
 Apple may have delayed its own smartwatch release to learn as much 
about what customers liked, and didn't like, in the Samsung version.

Since
 the first Apple iWatch rumours emerged in 2012, a number of 
artists have created concept images of what it may look like.

Apple is rumoured to be working on an alternative way to charge its much-rumoured iWatch, concept pictured, to remove the need for wires and chargers. Reports claim the first model will be charged wirelessly, while future models may be powered by solar or kinetic energy

Many resembled the square and clunky design of Samsung’s Galaxy 
Gear, yet the latest images from Californian designer Todd Hamilton imagine a much more sleek and elegant curved device.

Hamilton
 took inspiration from fitness bands, as well as the look and 
functionality of Apple’s iOS7, to create a watch that is ‘like something
 Apple would actually produce.'

The concept watch is shown as a simple band, fitted round the wrist like the Nike Fuelband, with a curved touchscreen.

Previous iWatch concept images, including this one from MacUser magazine, featured a square screen, and a clunky design, that more closely resembled Samsung's Galaxy Gear smartwatch

Samsung beat Apple to the smartwatch market when it released its Android-powered Galaxy Gear, pictured, in September. However, its design, functionality and battery life has been heavily criticised and experts believe Apple may have delayed its iWatch release to learn more about what customers like, and don't like
