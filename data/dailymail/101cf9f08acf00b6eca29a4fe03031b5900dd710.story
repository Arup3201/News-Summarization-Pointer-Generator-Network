Forty two shots at goal. That was the incredible total registered by Brentford as they blew Blackpool away. Forty two.

Four of them went in and 14 of them were on target, including a hat-trick from Jon Toral.

Just why is it they are sacking Mark Warburton at the end of the season again? Still their soon-to-be-former manager kept alive chances of promotion to the Premier League, having only guided them up from League One last season, with this obliteration.

Owner Matthew Benham claimed he had the long-term interests of the club at heart when he made the decision axe Warburton after this campaign.

He may live to rue that largely unpopular choice if Warburton’s replacement fails to work the same miracles with this set of players.

After 16 minutes of constant pressure they took the lead. A slick passing move - one of many - ended with Jonathan Douglas in plenty of space inside the box on the left and he could have shot himself but passed into Jon Toral to poke in.

Two minutes later and Brentford were two ahead. This time they found space down the right and Andre Gray crossed deep to Toral to head in completely free at the back post for his second of the night.

Blackpool’s first-half penalty area was heavily patched up with sand, but it made the Seasiders no more at home as Brentford poured forward with waves of attack.

Gray should have put Brentford three ahead when he ran through on goal with time and space, but Blackpool goalkeeper Joe Lewis was out quickly to block.

When Blackpool’s Charles Dunne was shown a straight red card for a lunge on Jota a minute before the break, it was hard to imagine a worse half of football for one side.

Predictably, seven minutes into the second half the home side went three ahead when Gray saw a spectacular volley saved but collected the rebound and beat the keeper via the right post.

Alex Pritchard had a vicious shot saved from inside the box on the right and Gray had another go, turning a defender and getting a shot away which was again kept out.

Granted, Blackpool are an embarrassment to the division, rock bottom and already 12 points adrift of safety. But no team, however much a gulf in class between the sides, should be so cut open in one match.

As the game rolled on it became more like a training ground affair; an attack versus defence drill. Warburton threw on two more forwards - Tommy Smith and Chris Long - for shooting practice. But it was Toral who completed the rout, and his treble, with a close-range finish in the 89th minute.

Deservedly, Warburton’s name rang from the stands as the final whistle blew.
