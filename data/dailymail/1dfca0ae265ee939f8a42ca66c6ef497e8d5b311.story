Savers who try to reduce their inheritance tax bill could be forced to pay the levy up front under new proposals

Savers who try to reduce their inheritance tax bill could be forced to pay the levy up front under new proposals.

Ministers are concerned that rising numbers of wealthy people are using complicated schemes to cut what they pay in taxes after their death.

HM Revenue & Customs now suggests that those suspected of avoiding inheritance duty should pay it in full – while an investigation takes place into their tax affairs.

Inheritance tax at 40 per cent is paid on estates worth more than £325,000 per person, and many more families have been dragged into the threshold in recent years. 

But some experts say the proposal, which is out for consultation, assumes someone is ‘guilty until proven innocent’ and people who use tax planning schemes legitimately could feel ‘criminalised’ by it.

HMRC suggests that people who are suspected of using aggressive tax avoidance schemes should be liable to an ‘accelerated payment’ of inheritance tax during their lifetime. 

If after an investigation, they are found to have been acting legitimately, the money will be repaid.

The Conservatives are sensitive to criticism of inheritance tax. The party promised to raise the threshold to £1million in 2007 – but no action has so far been taken.

Inheritance tax brought in £3.4billion to the Exchequer last year – £1billion more than in 2009. But experts fear it is a target for tax avoidance. 

Nearly 3,500 tax avoidance schemes have been uncovered in the past decade, according to official figures. 

HMRC made clear that it does not want the new laws to affect trusts or schemes that are used legitimately by the ‘vast majority of people’.

A spokesman said ‘very small numbers’ of wealthy people would be affected, with the focus on those who had taken ‘deliberate’ action to avoid tax.

The proposal is part of the Government’s crackdown on tax avoidance, following a strong of high-profile cases such as that of Take That singer Gary Barlow.

Inheritance tax can be avoided by putting certain financial assets in a trust, so tax does not apply.

Stuart Phillips, of tax planning firm Private Office, told The Daily Telegraph: ‘The concern is that the Revenue takes a highly aggressive stance... and terrifies families who have been engaging in legitimate tax planning that has been used for many years.

‘I’m apprehensive that large-scale action could have unintended consequences.’ Around 26,000 people were liable for inheritance tax last year.

An HMRC spokesman said: ‘We are seeking views on tackling inheritance tax avoidance schemes. This is an ongoing consultation and no final decisions have yet been taken.

‘The proposals in the consultation paper will only affect a small minority of wealthy individuals who actively seek to avoid Inheritance Tax.

‘Couples would still be able to leave up to £650,000 tax free to benefit their children or grandchildren.’
