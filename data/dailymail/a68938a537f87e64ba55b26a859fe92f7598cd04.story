What better way to kick off the next generation of videogames than with one of gaming’s best-loved characters.

British developers System 3 have announced that Putty Squad is making a return on all major consoles – and will be a launch title for the PlayStation 4.

Great fun: it may not boast eye-popping visuals, but Putty Squad oozes character

Regarded by many as one of the best games of its time, you play an unlikely hero called Putty – out to rescue his kidnapped friends.

Thankfully, Putty has a variety of abilities to help him along the way.  He can stretch to reach items and drop to areas below him. He can also lie flat to avoid enemies and absorb items that can be used at a later date.

Then there's the attack move, where Putty makes a fist to bash enemies, and if it all gets too much, he can inflate and soar to previously out-of-reach areas.

Gameplay is incredibly addictive and takes you back to the golden age of gaming. It's a welcome change from the Call Of Dutys and Grand Theft Autos - oozing character, and boasting a charm seldom found in contemporary video games.

Even the menu screens bring a smile to your face. Whether it's watching a band of enemies play music, or traversing the Mario Galaxy-style level map, every inch of Putty Squad has been given the love and attention that made the original such a success.

It’s helped by some vibrant visuals, too. Although its side-scrolling nature puts a limit on all-out graphical quality – it’s still incredibly pleasing on the eye. Environments are varied enough to stave off monotony – ranging from Egyptian-esque tombs to scary laboratories.

Best of British: Renowned developers System 3 are behind the game - one of Britain's last great developers

The game will also feature on mobile devices. Although many details are being kept under wraps for the iPhone and iPad versions - users will be able to tap to move Putty to a desired location and also to absorb items. 

PlayStation 3 and next-gen offerings will feature crisp 1080p visuals.

All in all, it’s set to make a wonderful trip down memory lane.
