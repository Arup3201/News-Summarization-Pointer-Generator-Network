A mother says she feels like a monster after a bungled £4,000 dental procedure left her totally toothless.

Gabriela Andrews, 48, now has just a few jagged bones for teeth and faces a bill for more than £15,000 to repair her smile.

But she has been left powerless to get compensation for the botched treatment because the private dentist who gave her dental implants in Cornwall in January 2010 has since moved to Poland and been struck off.

Devastation: Gabriella Andrews says her confidence has been destroyed since a dentist left her looking 'like a monster' following botched operation to dental implants

She said: ‘I have been left looking like a monster.  I’m embarrassed when I talk.

‘I feel like people are staring at me. My confidence has been affected, my speech has been affected, I can’t eat solid food and nobody does you justice.

‘To be left like this, you can’t believe it can happen in this country. There’s nothing I can do. I have a mortgage to pay and bills. I cannot afford to fix this. I don’t want other people to fall in to this situation.’

The work had been undertaken by self-employed dentist Piotr Tadeusz Reichel.

Dr Reichel’s licence to practise has been suspended by the General Dental Council ‘for protection of the public and in the public interest’ - in relation to care of several patients.

Gabriela, from Keysham, Devon, said: ‘I went back to the clinic but they said the dentist is self-employed and it’s his responsibility, his insurance will pay.

‘Then you go backwards and forwards, investigating and investigating.’

A letter from Gabriela’s lawyers last year stated they are unable to pursue her case due to Dr Reichel’s indemnity status.

It stated that although Dr Reichel had insurance at the time of the treatment ‘the policy was not adequate to cover claims made after the relevant insurance period had expired’.

They said she would have to enforce any judgement against him in Poland, which was unlikely to be successful.

The mother of one from Plymouth, Devon, claims dozens of other people may also be victims of this legal loophole.

Gabriela, who works as an area manager for a holiday home cleaning company, has been fighting for two years for the money to put things right.

She is among campaigners calling for immediate change to laws which can leave patients powerless if dentists have no insurance, move abroad or refuse to contact their insurers.

Gabriela opted for private treatment because she thought it would be the cheapest option after spending years saving the £4,125 needed for dental implants.

She had previously had her upper teeth removed due to chronic root-canal infections because of an underlying health condition.

A denture in her lower jaw was also failing. She had the dental implants - four metal rods in her upper gum. A bridge of teeth was to be attached at a later date.

The procedure failed and Gabriela also lost her lower denture.

Gabriela is backing national campaign ‘Bridge the Gap’, launched by the Dental Law Partnership, which calls for changes in the law.

She has approached MP Oliver Colvile who has written to Secretary of State for Health, Andrew Lansley about the issue.

Mr Colvile, MP for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport, said: ‘I’m horrified by what has happened to Gabriela and am very supportive of her case.

‘We have got to try and close this legal loophole because people rightly expect when they go to a dentist, to be treated properly.’

Gabriela’s work was carried out at the Tamar Valley Dental Clinic in Kelly Bray near Callington.

Darren Gardiner, of Tamar Valley Dental Clinic, said Dr Reichel was self-employed and money would have to come through his insurers.

He said: ‘We are sympathetic towards her plight and emphasise the real need for a change in law in this country regarding indemnity insurance.’

He said since Dr Reichel returned to Poland in May 2010 he has not replied to contact from the clinic, his indemnity insurers, the Dental Defence Union, DDU, or the General Dental Council, GDC.

He said the clinic is absolutely disgusted with the indemnity insurer’s stance and believe the GDC should apply more pressure.

A GDC spokeswoman said that Dr Reichel has been struck off the GDC’s register so he cannot work legally in the UK.

A misconduct hearing found ‘wide-ranging failings of Mr Reichel’s practice including the planning and execution of treatment, aftercare, a failure to obtain informed consent and failings in the manner in which he has dealt with complaints and enquiries as to his indemnity cover’.

The spokeswoman said: ‘While we are sympathetic to the situation Gabriela finds herself in, it is important to note that we do not have the powers to award compensation - that is a matter for the courts - nor do we have powers to make insurance providers co-operate with solicitors.’

A DDU spokesperson said they were unable to comment about individual cases or the issue in general.

The Department of Health has said it aims to have a consultation on indemnity cover for all health professionals in the autumn, and it is likely that legislation will be amended.
