Proud Australian produce purchasers would have had a difficult time buying asparagus from one local Woolworths recently, after the supermarket giant displayed a puzzling label.

James Anderson, from Turbo Productions, took a snap of the confusing tag at his local Woolworth in Docklands, Victoria, to share his disappointment that the supermarket wasn't sourcing its asparagus from nearby local growers.

A Woolworths spokesperson explained to Daily Mail Australia that in the case of asparagus, the vegetable is sourced from Australian sources when it is in season – from September through to March. At other points of the year, it is imported from Peru and Mexico.

However a spokesperson from the Australian Made Campaign Limited, Ben Lazzaro, dubbed the label too vague and said it was simply 'not good enough'.

'Consumers need confidence that they're buying the product from either Australia or elsewhere and it should be clearly labelled as such,' he said.

Mr Lazzaro admitted that generally, supermarkets provide a majority of Australian grown products in their fresh produce section.

'The major supermarkets – Coles, Woolworth and even Aldi - around 95 per cent of what they stock in their fresh food produce is Australian grown,' he said.

Woolworths has placed a table on their website which informs viewers where their fruit and vegetables are sourced from: About 95 per cent of what major supermarkets stock in fresh food is Australian grown

'They cop a lot of heat for that five per cent, but it is generally due to seasonality and often the product literally just cannot be sourced. 

'Although we want to eat Aussie all year round, there are some unavoidable realities we have to put up with.'

Instead, Mr Lazzaro said the real challenge presents itself in the labelling of processed and packaged food, which is often vaguely stamped with the words 'made from local and imported ingredients'.

The most common products that stump shoppers as to their origins include canned tomatoes –which often have imported ingredients from Italy or China – and baked beans – often sourced from South America

The two common products that he identified as stumping shoppers as to their origins include canned tomatoes – which often have imported ingredients from Italy or China – and baked beans – where the beans are often sourced from South American countries. 

Mr Lazzaro suggested that consumers keen to support Australian local businesses should look out for the green and gold triangular kangaroo symbol which remains the only means tested way to guarantee a product is produced locally.

Supermarkets could also do more to specify which products were Australian made by designating section in isles or using signs and labels to call out where the local options can be found, he said.
