A British company is opening a gay retirement village in the south of France – leaving the region’s mayor ‘flabbergasted’.

Yves Bastie gave planning permission for the building of 107 eco-friendly homes at Salleles-d’Aude earlier this year.

But he has only just discovered that the development near Perpignan will be France’s first ‘rainbow’ retirement centre.

Village Group, have made it clear that gay people will be particularly welcome at 'Le Village - Canal du Midi'

In France it is against the law for homes to be marketed solely at a specific sexual orientation

And it is hardly surprising – the developers admitted they made the decision on Monday as an experiment, because they were on the verge of closing the project down completely.

In France it is against the law for homes to be marketed solely at a specific sexual orientation. But the developers, Village Group, have made it clear that gay people will be particularly welcome.

Mr Bastie said when he was asked for approval he was shown pictures of heterosexual couples at another Village Group project designed for ‘over 50s seeking a healthy lifestyle’.

He said he had no idea that the company would be aiming the development – called ‘Le Village - Canal du Midi’ and worth more than £20million –  predominantly at the gay community.

The starting price for the houses 'which are not yet built 'is £206,000, with service charges of around £60 a week

Promotion: The community's website says it is intended for 'the +50s Gay & Lesbian (lgbt) Community'

‘I’m flabbergasted,’ said Mr Bastie.  ‘I had absolutely no idea about this. What will be the effect on the image of the town?’

Gay marriage was legalised in France in May, but there have been mass demonstrations against the move. Conservative groups, including the Roman Catholic Church, have called for an end to the promotion of homosexual lifestyles.

The online brochure for ‘Le Village’  displays a picture of the Canal du Midi with a rainbow flag – the symbol of ‘gay liberation’.

Its website describes the development as: ‘A private oasis for the +50s Gay and Lesbian Community who want an “Active and Healthy Lifestyle” in the warm, friendly and healthy climate of Southern France.’ The starting price for the houses – which are not yet built – is £206,000, with service charges of around £60 a week.

Location: The development will be located near Perpignan in the south of France

Danny Silver, managing director of Villages Group, admitted he only had the idea about marketing the village to the gay community on Monday.

He said: ‘The real estate market in France is so bad right now, and getting the planning permission took such a long time, that we were on the verge of closing the project down completely.

‘We didn’t have any takers, and when we had the idea of marketing it in this way, we thought, “Why not?” It was an experiment, the last toss of the coin.’

Mr Silver said the online brochure was changed on Monday. Since then interest has amounted to ‘thousands of emails every hour’. I’ve been 40 years in this business and I’ve never seen anything like it,’ he said. But he stressed heterosexuals would still be welcome in the village.
