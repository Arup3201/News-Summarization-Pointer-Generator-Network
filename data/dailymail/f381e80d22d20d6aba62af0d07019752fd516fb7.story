A woman who was allegedly raped by top defense lawyer Sanford Rubenstein woke up with bruises on her arms and surrounded by bloody condoms, her lawyers have said.

The unnamed accuser says she was raped by Rubenstein, a high-flying New York attorney, in his penthouse apartment earlier this month after the Reverend Al Sharpton's star-studded birthday party.

More graphic details of the alleged assault were put forward in a letter her lawyers hand-delivered to the Manhattan district attorney's office, demanding he be arrested and charged with rape.

Accused: High-flying defense lawyer Sanford Rubenstein has been accused of raping a worker for Al Sharpton's National Action Network

Once close: Rubenstein, pictured above with Sharpton, met his accuser at the Reverend's birthday party at the Four Seasons restaurant in Manhattan on October 1. Sharpton has since distanced himself from him

It described the scene as the woman, who works for Sharpton's National Action Network, woke up, 'bloody condoms laying around her'. Her arms were bruised and she was suffering vaginal bleeding, the letter, reported by the New York Times, said. 

The bruises were said to be evidence that she was held down during the encounter - which Rubenstein has insisted was consensual.

Rubenstein has not been charged with a crime. 

The woman's lawyers - Kenneth J. Montgomery and Keith White - added that she later used a rape kit, and that the results were consistent with sexual assault. They demanded he be charged with third-degree rape at the least.

The alleged attack took place after Sharpton's 60th birthday party at the Four Seasons restaurant, which was attended by New York mayor Bill de Blasio, Governor Andrew Cuomo, singer Aretha Franklin and director Spike Lee

Rubenstein and his alleged victim met at the party and went home to his Upper East Side apartment along with a third person, who later left. 

After the allegations surfaced, NYPD detectives searched the attorney's $7million penthouse apartment on East 63rd Street in Manhattan and reportedly collected 'biological evidence'.

Allegations: Rubenstein has maintained the encounter was consensual. He is pictured above with a former client, one-time Playboy playmate Stephanie Adams

Denial: Rubenstein's own defense lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said the letter is 'offensive and patently false'

Cops also hauled away bedding, a mattress and a sex toy.

Rubenstein is a well-known society figure in New York and has fought high-profile cases linked to the National Action Network, often over the actions of the NYPD.

Sharpton has also found himself drawn into commenting on the accusations, telling a crowd: 'I don't care how close we are - if he's wrong, he's wrong.' 

He said: 'We do not justify disrespecting women. Doesn't mean you're guilty, but it does mean if you are, ain't no place for that in our community. 

The district attorney's office told the Times the case was being investigated, and declined to comment further. 

Rubenstein's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, rebutted the letter, saying that 'all evidence to date points to consensual sex between two consenting adults, who were both active and awake throughout.' 

Brafman described the letter as 'offensive and patently false.'
