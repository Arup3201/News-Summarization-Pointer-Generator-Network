Uruguay's media have reacted to their national team's dramatic 2-1 triumph over England in rather dramatic fashon and, unsurprisingly, Luis Suarez features heavily.

The forward tormented the Three Lions on his return from injury, scoring twice and pushing them to the brink of a World Cup exit.

The South American side, meanwhile, recovered superbly from their horrific opening defeat at the hands of Costa Rica, and they are now firmly back in contention to qualify for the last 16.
