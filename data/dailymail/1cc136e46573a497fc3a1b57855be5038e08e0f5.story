The original costumes worn by screen star Mike Myers as groovy British spy Austin Powers and his arch nemesis Dr Evil have emerged for sale for $34,000 (£20,000).

Comedy actor Myers donned the iconic outfits for the hit 1997 film Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery in which he played both the lead characters.

Austin Powers was a 'shagadelic' sixties spy with a colourful dress sense, bad teeth and a penchant for swinging while Dr Evil was a villain obsessed with taking over the world.

Austin's unforgettable costume features a blue velvet suit with trippy satin lining, a white shirt with lace collar, cuffs and cravat, glasses and trademark necklace.

The Dr Evil outfit consists of a grey two piece suit and white trainers.

Both costumes have come direct from New Line Cinema, the Hollywood studio which made the Austin Powers trilogy of films, and are sold with certificates of authenticity.

Bidding on the Austin Powers costume starts at $20,000 (£12,000) while the Dr Evil outfit starts at $12,000 (£7,000) - but experts say they could both sell for up to three times those amounts.

Desi DosSantos, from California-based auctioneers Screen Used, said: 'Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery is one of the most popular films of recent times and its main characters are instantly recognisable.

'These costumes have come to us direct from New Line Cinema studios who made the original film 17 years ago.

'It is often the case that once a studio has finished a production they get rid of the majority of the costumes and keep only a handful.

'Both these costumes have been kept by the studio for the last 17 years but with no Austin Powers movies in the pipeline they're not needed.

'Austin Powers was one of Mike Myers' greatest creations and this costume is not just the iconic blue suit but also the white ruffled shirt, the thick glasses and his pendant.

'It even has Mike Myers' name written in it. The only thing it doesn't come with is Austin Powers' teeth.

'What makes this auction all the more remarkable is that also for sale is the Dr Evil costume also worn by Mike Myers.

'It could be the first time ever these two costumes have appeared in the same auction.

'Austin Powers is such a popular film that these costumes will appeal to a wide range of buyers from film fans to serious collectors.'

The auction will take place on Saturday.
