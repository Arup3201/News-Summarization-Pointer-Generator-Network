Pakistan have named Azhar Ali as captain for one-day cricket after ignoring the middle-order batsman for the Cricket World Cup, where they were eliminated in the quarter-final.

Ali, who played the last of his 14 one-day internationals in 2013, replaces Misbah-ul-Haq, who has retired from ODIs. 

Misbah will continue to lead in test matches, where Ali will be vice-captain.

Wicketkeeper Sarfraz Ahmed was named as vice-captain for ODIs and will also be Shahid Afridi's deputy in Twenty20s.

Former test batsman Haroon Rasheed will be the new chief selector, with Kabir Khan - who has coached Afghanistan - included in the four-member selection panel.

Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Shaharyar Khan says captain and coaches will have no voting rights in selection and can only give their suggestions to the selection committee.
