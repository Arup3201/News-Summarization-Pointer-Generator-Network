Pupils will take cheerleading as part of A-level studies for the first time.

The module will count towards their A-level in either PE or dance. It can also form part of a BTEC in sport or be taken on its own.

Thurstable School in Tiptree, Essex, will run the two-year course for the first time in September next year.

The school’s cheerleading 
club has proved so popular since it was introduced, pom-pom waving 
pupils want to continue to hone their skills.

Cathy
 Graham, who will teach the sixth formers, said: 'Year 11s are saying we
 want to continue, so I said let’s look at a qualification in the sixth 
form.

'The school is really happy with that so they’ll be starting from next September.'

Mrs
 Graham said typical cheerleading lessons would teach health and safety,
 first aid, improving performance skills, coaching stunts and even 
marketing the sport.

Typically there will be three hours’ lesson time a week plus extra required for rehearsals and performances.

Cheerleading is already hugely popular in the U.S., with this squad visiting London from Detroit

The cheerleading qualification will not earn students UCAS points for a university or college application.

However, Mrs Graham hopes universities will recognise the value of the courses when sixth form students apply to them.

She said: 'Most universities these days have a cheerleading squad, it is a massive thing now.'

'More
 and more it is seen as something different and shows students have been
 part of a team and have stuck at something. It is very up and coming.

'The student will have travelled and have a lot of performance experience.'

Deputy headmaster John Lee said: ‘As a sports college we already offer a partnership with Colchester United football training.

'We have had golf training as well, in partnership with a local golf provider.

'We are always looking for ways to engage with students and offer something different, and this is different.'
