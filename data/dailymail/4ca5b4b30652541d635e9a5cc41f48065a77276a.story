Going to prison: Kirsty Debanks outside Oxford Crown Court where she admitted fabricating a rape charge

A woman has been jailed for eight months after falsely accusing her ex boyfriend of raping her.

Kirsty Debanks, 20, lied that Chris Newitt had attacked her the day after she suffered a miscarriage.

However, she finally admitted that she had made it all up when CCTV showed Mr Newitt was in Oxford city centre with his brother at the time.

Sentencing her, Judge Ian Pringles told Miss Debanks 'Those who suffer genuine rape are undermined by people 
like you. You undermine the whole system of justice.'

He added: 'I would be failing in my duty today if I was not to pass an immediate prison sentence.'

The city's crown court heard that police were called by paramedics to help control Debanks who was claiming to be having a miscarriage.

Prosecutor Jonathan Stone said the next day Debanks told police that Mr Newitt had raped her when she got home from hospital.

Mr Stone told the court: 'She said he had pushed her friend Tracy out of the address.

'He had pushed her (Debanks) down on the sofa. He said: 'You're going to f*** me whether you like it or not'."

Mr Newitt was arrested and questioned in
 police custody for almost six hours and subjected to forensic testing.

Officers visited her to begin the formal investigation but she told them she did not want to make a complaint only 'wanted the defendant to pay for what he did'.

She also refused a medical appointment and would not sign the officer's notebook to confirm her account.Â 

False claim: Kirsty Debanks showed 'no remorse' the prosecution said in court

However, later on she called police to say that she did want to make the complaint. In interview she described the alleged attack to them, saying Mr Newitt's face was 'pure evil'.

Miss Debanks' mother then called police and said something did not ring true in her daughter's account.

Mr Newitt protested that he could not have carried out the attack as he was in Oxford city centre with his brother at the time. When officers viewed CCTV footage it confirmed his account.

Debanks then called police herself and confessed that she had lied.

In
 her statement she explained that in fact she had gone to the pub with 
her friend Tracy to drink double vodkas and beers, then gone back to her
 home to continue drinking and smoke crack cocaine.

Punishment: The judge at Oxford Crown Court said that Miss Debanks undermined 'the whole system of justice'

Tracy
 then suggested making the false claim, she said. Debanks only told the 
truth when her mother warned her the case would go to trial.

'She appeared to show no remorse. In fact she smirked as she gave her account,' Mr Stone told Oxford Crown Court.

Lucy
 Ffrench, defending, said Debanks had suffered a difficult time, 
including the loss of her father to cancer and of her uncle in a freak 
accident, as well as other personal issues.

'She has been looking in the wrong places for the attention she craves,' said Ms Ffrench.
