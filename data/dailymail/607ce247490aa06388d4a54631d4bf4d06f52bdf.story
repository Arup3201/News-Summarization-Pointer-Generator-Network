After what will have seemed like an eternity to Liverpool fans, Brendan Rodgers leads his men into the Champions League for the first time in five seasons on Tuesday.

No more painful evenings of sitting at home watching the likes of Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Manchester City mixing it with the best in Europe, while Liverpool toiled against the continent's second tier, or worse still had no European football at all at Anfield.

But back in 2009/10, instead of leading Liverpool to their third Champions League final in six seasons, Rafa Benitez - the man in charge at the time - oversaw a disastrous third-place finish in their group with Fiorentina, Lyon and Hungarians Debrecen.

And to illustrate just how much has changed at the club since the 2009/10 season, we've picked out five key points from autumn 2009 at Anfield.

In just five years Raheem Sterling has gone from obscurity to worldwide fame with Liverpool and England

Star forward Raheem Sterling was just a 14-year-old trainee with QPR

Sterling might be a household name to many now with his trademark direct running and rapidly-improving link-up play, but back then the QPR prospect was so young he would have been denied entry to a 15-certificate film at his local cinema.

He went on to join the Reds in an initial deal of £400,000 in early 2010 after being wowed by former Liverpool hero Fernando Torres on a visit to Melwood to check out the set-up.

Back in 2009 Brendan Rodgers only surived a few months at struggling Championship Reading

The Northern Irishman was considered a talented up-and-coming manager after a spell working with Jose Mourinho at Chelsea and helping Watford to avoid relegation in his first managerial job.

But things didn't go quite so well at Reading, when the then 36-year-old rookie boss only made it to December before a poor run of results saw him leave by mutual consent.

After a short spell out, the resilient Rodgers took Swansea up in his first season and comfortably kept them there before Liverpool came calling.

The tumultuous reign of the Americans was still in full effect in the autumn of 2009 (they weren't ousted until late 2010) as Benitez found himself constantly clashing with Gillette and Hicks over the running of team affairs.

Just how destabilising their control of the club had been didn't become clear to many until they'd been shown the door in dramatic fashion.

Alberto Aquilani was bought in to replace Xabi Alonso in the Liverpool midfield for the 2009/10 season

Alberto Aquilani is the man entrusted to replace the hugely popular Xabi Alonso 

Selling Alonso to Real Madrid in the summer of 2009 is a mistake Benitez must still rue to this day. But buying Alberto Aquilani for £20million, who was injured for the first few weeks of his Liverpool career, was arguably a bigger mistake.

Aquilani only managed a handful of games for the Reds, before a number of loans in his native Italy finally brought about a permanent sale to Fiorentina at a huge loss.

Even more damaging was the Alonso-shaped hope in the Liverpool midfield for some time after.

Steven Gerrard, seen here in Liverpool's disastrous campaign, is one of only three surviving senior players

The best way to illustrate the churn of players through the door at Anfield since that time is that the only current senior players from the 2009/10 are Steven Gerrard, Glen Johnson, Martin Skrtel and Lucas Leiva.

The starting line-up in Liverpool's final match of that campaign (which they lost 2-1 to Fiorentina) included such stellar talents as Diego Cavalieri in goal, Stephen Darby and Emiliano Ensua in defence, while Andrea Dossena put his attacking skills to great effect on the left wing.

Liverpool fans will be hoping their return to the Champions League has a very different outcome to the last time they graced Europe's elite competition.
