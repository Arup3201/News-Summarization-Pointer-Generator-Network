A teacher has been told he can return to the classroom in just two years despite performing a series of sexually explicit actions with a string of young pupils.

In one instance, Gregory Hallam inflated a condom covered in baby oil and asked a boy to rub it until it burst, a disciplinary tribunal heard.

On another occasion, the 40-year-old talked about porn to a pupil, aged 14, who he had befriended on Facebook, a report into his conduct said.

And an investigation into Hallam's behaviour also found he used school computers to access pornography.

He was found guilty of 'unacceptable professional conduct' and not maintaining 'appropriate boundaries' with pupils while teaching at Oriel High School at Gorleston, Norfolk, and banned him from the classroom.

But despite a report concluding that 'Mr Hallam's actions tend to indicate a deep-seated attitude that could lead to harmful behaviour', a decision by an Education Department official, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Michael Gove, paves the way for him to return teaching after just two years.

At the end of the two year ban Hallam will be entitled to apply to return to teaching.

But he will first have to convince another panel from the National College for Teaching and Leaders that he is fit to return.

An investigation into Hallam's conduct found: 'We consider that Mr Hallam's comments
in relation to this subject were inappropriate given that he was not 
conducting a sex and relationship education class and there were younger
pupils in the classroom.'

It continued: 'He failed to maintain appropriate professional 
boundaries in his relationship with a 14-year-old student, Student A, by
accepting her as a friend on Facebook, communicating with her through 
Facebook on four occasions and made an inappropriate comment to her on 
the site by saying he was "watching porn".

Cleared to return: Married RE teacher Geoffrey Bettley, pictured, was deemed fit to return to teaching after being found with indecent images of children

'There
was no good reason why Mr Hallam needed to befriend Student A and the 
dangers of doing so are clearly illustrated by the comment about 
pornography.'

Earlier this month, teacher Geoffrey Bettley, 36, was sacked, given a police caution and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders’ Register after  admitting viewing sickening images over several years.

But a professional conduct panel said the married RE teacher could return to the classroom because of his ‘excellent teaching’.

A senior Education Department official rubber-stamped the decision, saying there was a ‘need to be proportionate and to act in the public interest’.

The case sparked a furious reaction from MPs, schools campaigners and a children’s  charity. Research has shown that one in six men who view child porn go on to abuse children.

In this case, Hallam was 
also found to have befriended another 14-year old girl, Student B, on 
Facebook and to have used School ICT equipment to access pornographic 
material.

However, an allegation that he had discussed his sex life with pupils was dismissed.

Announcing
the ban Alan Meyrick, Deputy Director Teacher Regulation at the 
Department for Education, said: 'Mr Hallam failed to maintain 
appropriate professional boundaries in his relationships with students.

'The
Panel find these actions amount to unacceptable professional conduct 
and conduct that may bring the profession into disrepute.

'The
Panel find that Mr Hallam's behaviour was simply not consistent with 
the standards that are expected of a teacher. They also say that it is 
of the utmost importance that a teacher at all times maintains a proper 
and professional relationship with students.

'The
Panel also say that Mr Hallam's actions tend to indicate a deep-seated 
attitude that could lead to harmful behaviour, although they qualify 
that by saying that there is not a lengthy pattern of behaviour that 
proves that conclusively.

'It
is in part the cumulative impact of his conduct that lies at the heart 
of this case. Although he has shown remorse, the panel have been shown 
no evidence in the form of references or testimonials in his support.

'I
have given careful attention to the totality of the findings in this 
case and to the need to be proportionate. I have also given careful 
attention to the need to balance the rights of the individual with the 
wider need to protect the reputation of the profession.

'In
my judgement, this case is one where the outcome should be a 
Prohibition Order to reflect the serious nature of the findings and the 
fact that those actions were not a one off event.'

However,
in the light of the fact that the panel identified some remorse from Mr
Hallam, he said that he should be entitled to apply to have the 
Prohibition Order set aside after two years.

Hallam has a right of appeal to the High Court.
