Coventry City have sacked manager Steven Pressley after the League One club slipped into the relegation zone.

Coventry surrendered a two-goal lead against 10 men at Sheffield United on Saturday to draw 2-2, meaning their last win arrived against Walsall on January 3.

Dave Hockaday and Neil MacFarlane have been placed temporarily in charge following the disappointing result in Pressley's 100th match as Coventry manager at Bramall Lane.

Coventry chief executive Steve Waggott told their official website: 'This has been a very difficult decision from a personal and professional point of view, and we would like to place on record our thanks to Steven for his efforts over the last two years.

'But results over recent weeks and months, and our precarious position in the league table, means that a change of direction at first team level is needed. Neil MacFarlane and Dave Hockaday have been placed in temporary charge.'

Coventry have won just six of their last 28 games under Pressley, and are on the edge of being relegated to the Football League's basement division. They next play MK Dons on Saturday.
