We are used to seeing her dressed in aristocratic finery as Downton Abbey’s Lady Rose MacClare.

But Lily James couldn’t have looked further from her alter ego as she enjoyed a stroll with her boyfriend Matt Smith earlier this week.

Miss James, 25, wore tight denim jeans, with a ragged hole in one knee, which had been unevenly turned up at the ankles.

Off duty: The couple looked worlds away from their renowned roles as they stepped out in jeans and trainers

Cosy: Lily was swamped in an over-sized blue knitted jumper, while Matt covered his head in a hoodie

Strolling along: The pair looked laid-back as Lily was sporting scuffed denim jeans with a hole in the knee

The laces of her dark blue Converse shoes were untidily tied. 

And she was swamped by an over-sized blue knitted jumper, which had sleeves so long they hung down past her hands.

It was a far cry from the elegant gowns and lace gloves she wears to play the rebellious great-niece of Dame Maggie Smith’s Violet, the Dowager Countess of Grantham in the ITV period drama. 

Cuddles: Lily smiled sweetly as the couple shared a walking embrace and Matt kissed the top of her head

On the go: Matt was clutching coconut water as he indulged in a touching display of affection in north London

A protective arm: Matt, 31, looked out protectively over Lily's head as she lifted her arm to hug him

Squeeze: A natural brunette, she looked completely comfortable wrapping both arms around her actor beau

And Miss James, who is leaving Downton Abbey after the fifth series, which begins next month, appeared to have already distanced herself from the role, by changing her hair colour from Lady Rose’s blonde to a version of her natural brunette. 

She was joined on her excursion in north London by Smith, 31, a former Doctor Who, who was also dressed casually.

He wore a dark hooded sweatshirt, which covered his head and dark glasses to hide his eyes.]

In character: Matt Smith spends his working days as a Time Lord, while Lily James dons finery for a living

Leaving: She is moving on from Downton to concentrate on other projects, like next year's Cinderella remake 

Dapper: When not wearing a hoodie and sunglasses, Matt Smith wears a dapper jacket and bow tie at work

Earlier this year Miss James, who is leaving Downton to concentrate on other projects including a starring role in next year’s Disney remake of Cinderella, admitted she doesn’t like being recognised.

She said: ‘I’m not on Twitter and when I’m not in character as Rose, I don’t look much like her. 

'When Cinderella comes out, I’m going to dye my hair back to my natural brown. I really don’t want the kind of fame where everyone knows who I am.’
