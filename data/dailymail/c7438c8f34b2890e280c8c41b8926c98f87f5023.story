Less than a month after they launched in the U.S., Amazon has announced it is bringing its new top-of-the-range Kindle Fire HDX tablets to the UK.

The 7-inch model costs £199 and will go on sale 13 November, while the 8.9-inch version will be available on 13 December for £329.

Available to pre-order from today, both tablets are said to be three times faster than the previous generation, as well as lighter and thinner.

The two tablets also have sharper, more colourful displays that feature more pixels per inch than the latest iPad and at least match the screen quality seen on the Google's new Nexus 7 device.

Amazon's 7-inch and a 8.9-inch Kindle Fire HDX tablets, pictured right to left, are three times faster than older models. They have higher pixel-per-inch displays than Apple's current iPad - making text or images sharper. They both go on sale in the UK next month

To access the new Mayday feature, users can press the Help button from the Kindle Fire HDX's homescreen. It will then call a live free technical support team member to help with operational questions or access to books, movies, songs or other media

The 7-inch model has a screen resolution of 1980 x 1200, giving it a PPI of 323, while the 8.9-inch, 2560 x 1600 display has a 339 PPI.

By comparison, the current iPad with Retina Display runs PPI of 264, while the new Google Nexus 7, quoted as having the best tablet screen on the market, has 323 PPI. 

The 7-inch model is now 8mm thick and weighs 303g - down 
from 10mm and 394g. Whereas the 8.9-inch model is 8mm thick, down from 9mm, and weighs 374g, which is a third lighter than the previous generation.

Both Kindle HDX models also come with 
Qualcomm's quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor, which is top of the line 
for tablets and can handle graphics four times 
faster than before.

Additionally, to help people who have not owned tablets before, the new Kindles come with a feature called 'Mayday', which lets users speak to a live customer service representative in a video window when downloading apps or using certain features.

The helpers can explain new features or troubleshoot problems while guiding users with on-screen hand scribbles. They can even take control of the device remotely.

CEO Jeff Bezos introduced the feature at the U.S. launch, saying it is 'completely unique' and takes advantage of Amazon's massive cloud computing and customer service infrastructure.

'You shouldn't have to be afraid of your device,' Mr Bezos said.

In a demo, Mr Bezos asked an on-screen customer service representative to recommend an app. The rep suggested Angry Birds: Star Wars II, while also giving instructions on how to set time limits on various activities for children.

While the new Kindles are upgraded in several ways, Amazon also cut the price on what will be its entry-level, updated 7-inch tablet, the Kindle Fire HD with 8GB of memory now costing £119 in the UK.

The new Kindle Fire HD has a magnesium alloy body, like the HDX models, but has the same screen resolution and processing power of the older models.

Stephen Baker, a consumer technology analyst with research firm NPD Group, said the price cut to the Kindle Fire HD will do more to help Amazon compete in the tablet market than the added features on the newer models.

Technology and Science reporter Victoria Woollaston gives her verdict on the tablet:

'Google's Nexus 7 has dominated the budget tablet market for some time, but Amazon's new Kindle Fire HDX range is a serious contender to challenge this.

'The most immediately impressive feature - on both devices - is the high quality screen, which really has to be seen to be appreciated

'Both screens are on par with the stunning clarity of Google's latest Nexus 7 and even when compared to high-end HD screens, the colours are noticeably brighter.

'During my brief hands-on with the two tablets, apps loaded immediately and switching between pages and applications was seamless. Amazon claims the devices are three times faster than previous models but this couldn't be qualified. 

'However, the quality of the screen combined with this speed did make watching video clips seem effortless.

'I was a little cynical about how useful the Mayday feature - which is a free 24/7 technical support team accessible from the tablet's homescreen - would be, but during a demonstration I was impressed at not only how simple it is to use and how approachable the customer support member was, but the range of features available. 

'The helper can draw on the screen, show or tell users how to do things by taking them through various menus and explain more about the features. The feature can also be muted, or screen sharing can be disabled simply by asking.

'Other notable features I was briefly shown include the X-Ray feature when watching Amazon-bought titles. This is an IMDB widget that sits to the left of the screen and shows details about the actors currently on screen.

'Viewers can also switch to bloopers and other significant scenes at the touch of a button from the IMDB X Ray Trivia tab, plus buy related tracks. This latter feature wasn't working  when I used the device, but Amazon claims it will be available from launch.

'Another feature that will appeal to parents is Kindle Free Time. This is an easy to setup feature designed especially for children that comes with parental controls pre-enabled. 

'The price of the 7-inch tablet is aimed directly at Google's latest tablet and for £199 there is a lot to get excited about. The £329 price for the 8.9-inch device does seems a little steep though. 

'Although I only used the devices briefly, I didn't think there was enough different about the larger model to warrant the extra £130 and it will mainly appeal to people who think the 7-inch screen is just a little small. 

'Having used and loved Google's Nexus 7, I'd be torn between this and Amazon's Kindle Fire HDX. Yet Google would win, at a push, because its operating system seems slicker and is pure Android, rather than a skinned version.'

'That's where that model needs to be priced,' Baker said, explaining that there are numerous manufacturers with tablets with screens that measure seven inches diagonally, all priced around the same mark.

'A big focus in that 7-inch category is just price.'

Between May and July, Kindles accounted for 17 per cent of all tablets sold in the U.S. compared to 48 per cent for Apple's iPad and 8 per cent for Samsung's Galaxy line, according to NPD.

Globally, Amazon's shipments between April and June were down 59 per cent from a year earlier, at 470,000.

This is compared to 14.6 million for Apple's iPad, down 17 percent from a year ago, and 10.8 million for Samsung's Galaxy line, up 539 per cent. Amazon sells most of its Kindles around the Christmas holidays, Baker said.

Beyond the improved specifications, Amazon also unveiled more features that incorporate data from its IMDb movie database partner.

With the newer tablets, users who turn on the 'X-ray' feature can see a small window that lists the name of a song that is playing in some TV shows and movies.

One tap brings up the option to buy the song. Users can also look for all music in a show and zip to the exact spot where a particular song is playing.

People who have set up Amazon's video player as an app on their TVs or through game consoles can also follow along in real-time on their tablets, getting information on actors and trivia related to the shows on their larger screen.

Music lovers can see song lyrics when they play songs bought from Amazon, lyrics are highlighted as they are sung and tapping on the lyrics will zip to the appropriate point in the song.

Bezos said these services are only possible because Amazon provides the hardware, operating system, applications, cloud infrastructure and services for the devices.

The 'hardest and coolest' services such as its Mayday service lie at the intersection of 'customer delight' and 'deep integration through the entire stack,' he added.

Amazon also unveiled new 'origami covers' that lie flat when closed over the screen but can be folded and snapped into place as a stand that works both in horizontal and vertical position. They'll come in seven different colours in the U.S for between $45 and $70.
