Brad Barritt has hit back furiously at claims he lacks international skill and flair and should be dumped by Stuart Lancaster.

The South African-born centre vowed to prove his critics wrong by helping England to Six Nations and World Cup glory.

Barritt, who has 22 caps, insists he feels ‘insulted’ by comments from the likes of former flanker Lewis Moody and leading coach Dean Ryan.

Moody labelled the 28-year-old a mere ‘stop gap’ in the side for more exciting talents while Ryan claimed he ‘should be not playing Test rugby’ because he ‘lacks the creativity and flair’.

Barritt hopes to start England’s Six Nations opener in Wales on February 6. He returned to club action with Saracens last weekend after recovering from a calf injury sustained in a bloody battle with Australia in the autumn.

Asked if he felt insulted by his critics’ remarks, he said: ‘Yes, for me that’s the wrong way of looking at the way I play, but I can’t change their view of me. What they say doesn’t bother me. If you are playing at the highest level it is part of the job to take criticism.

‘You just take it on the chin because you know, and the coaches around you know, what sort of player you are and what you bring to the team. It’s just their opinion.

‘I am true to myself and the other players around me. I have proved countless times that my game is very versatile. I’ve played in ball-playing roles as well as ball-carrying roles.

‘I have offered many things to the teams I’ve played for. You play the way which is needed to bring success to the team. I’d be happy to play in my very numerous roles for Sarries or England.’
