Harry Smith, 18, from Tangmere, West Sussex, had held his licence for about seven weeks when he crashed into a car, killing a 16-year-old and paralysing another

A boy racer has been jailed for four years after causing a crash which killed a 16-year-old girl passenger and paralysed another.

Harry Smith, 18, killed 16-year-old Jasmine Elkasmi,
 from Bognor Regis, after losing control of his Vauxhall Corsa in September last year. 

Smith, from Tangmere, West Sussex, had passed his test just weeks earlier and had also received a warning from police about his driving hours before the crash.

The court also heard that traces of alcohol and the main chemical found in cannabis were found in Smith's blood stream after the incident.

The crash, which took place on the A285 at Halnaker, near Chichester, West Sussex, left a second 16-year-old passenger paralysed from the waist down.

A third teenager needed surgery for facial and dental injuries. 

Smith, who had received two police warnings since passing his driving test seven weeks earlier, has now been jailed for four years.

The maximum available sentence for causing death by dangerous driving, as set by Parliament, is 14 years.

But offenders are entitled to a reduction of up to one third if they plead guilty. The guidelines for the sentence for the crime will also depend on the seriousness of the event.

Smith pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving and to two charges of causing serious injury by dangerous driving.

Judge Christopher Parker QC also disqualified him from driving for four years and ordered him to take an extended re-test before ever holding a licence again.

For determinate prison sentences, the law
 states that the offender should normally serve half in prison and half 
on licence in the community, meaning he could be released in two years.

Judge Parker said: 'That death and those injuries are the unwarranted consequence 
of your terrible foolishness in the face of not one, but two warnings.'

The court heard that the incident unfolded when Smith overturned his Vauxhall Corsa at around 6.45am.

Jasmine Elkasmi, 16, died from her injuries after Smith's Vauxhall Corsa crashed into her. Two other teenagers with whom she was travelling also sustained life-changing injuries

At the time, Smith had spent hours driving and was likely to be suffering from fatigue, the court heard.

Traces of tetrahydrocannabinol, the main chemical in cannabis, was found in his blood, although the court heard it was not enough to conclude he was under the influence at the time of the crash.

He also had a small amount of alcohol in his blood, but was still within the legal limit.

Jasmine died of her injuries in hospital a short time after the crash.

After the hearing, Sergeant Paul Wood, of the Arundel road policing unit, said: 'Smith was 17 at the time of the collision and he had only held his driving licence for about seven weeks.

'He had been stopped by police before the collision on a number of occasions due to the manner of his driving and he had been issued with a section 59 warning, which meant that if he had been stopped again, his vehicle would have been seized.

'A girl died as a result of his dangerous driving and two other girls were left with serious injuries, one of them life-changing.'

None of the victims’ families wished to comment after the sentencing.
