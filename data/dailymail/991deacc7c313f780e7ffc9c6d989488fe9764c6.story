Lured to a Washington, DC neighborhood by police reports of a violent home invasion, a news team looking for information wound up getting pepper sprayed by a furious resident.

Reporter for WUSA Bruce Johnson and photographer Danielle Gill went to a house in the city’s Southeast quadrant on Wednesday to cover a hostage situation and assault that reportedly occurred around 2am.

As they spoke with neighbors, a woman watched them from a second floor window of the house in question. When she asked them to leave and they didn’t, she became livid.

'Bye!' From the second floor window, this woman demanded a news crew leave her home, which had previously been the scene of a violent home invasion

No joke: When the crew doesn't leave, the woman appears at the door and shoots pepper spray at them

‘Goodbye,’ the unidentified woman screamed down from her window.

Johnson responded that they were on a public street and not her property, meaning she had no authority to make them go.

In a later segment on WUSA, Johnson hypothesizes that the young woman had been one of the eight people held hostage the night before when armed men entered the home, assaulting three of them.

One man reportedly had a broomstick shoved into his mouth.

'I asked you to leave!' The crew reminded her they were on a public sidewalk, but that wasn't good enough for her

Victim? Reporter Bruce Johnson concedes he doesn't know who the woman is, but says it's possible she was one of the victims from the previous night's kidnapping and assault reported in the home

'Don't touch me!': Eventually she is up in the faces of the news crew and threatening them over and over again. Finally, she knocks over their camera

Whatever the reason, Johnson said, ‘Obviously this woman is under a lot of stress.’

And she took it out on the reporters.

‘I asked you to leave,’ she screamed as she appeared at her front door, spraying a stream of pepper spray at them and directly toward the camera.

Meanwhile, a stream of expletives come from the woman’s mouth.

‘I’m gonna taze you’re a** next time, I’m telling you bye.’

Fast forward a few moments and the reporters haven’t left.

'We're gone': Johnson finally concedes to the woman and leaves the property, both he and the camera woman unharmed, as police arrived. They do not intend to press charges

The irate woman manages to hit both reporter and photographer with one punch.

‘We’re gone, we’re gone, we’re gone,’ Johnson finally concedes after the woman knocks over the video camera and continues to threaten them.

Johnson and Gill left unharmed as the police arrived, evidently called to the scene by concerned neighbors.

Johnson makes clear that he’s unsure who the woman was or if she was a victim in the crime early that morning.

Neighbors told him bad influences come and go from the area. They also said the people in the house had only lived there a handful of months.

But, said Johnson, ‘A guy who said he cuts their grass said they were good people.’
