The discovery of a doctor's body in a locked bathroom at the hospital where he worked has turned into a possible murder inquiry.

The body of anaesthetist Dr Karim Aly, 31, was found at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, South Wales, on August 23 along with a syringe and a blood-smeared latex glove.

Police who investigated at the time did not believe it to be foul play as there was no signs of a struggle.

The body of anaesthetist Dr Karim Aly, 31, was found at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, South Wales, on August 23 along with a syringe and a blood-smeared latex glove.

However in his native Egypt there have been claims in the media, as well as on a government website, that he was murdered.

Local coroner Peter Maddox subsequently ordered an autopsy but it has been condemned by Dr Aly's family who said 'dissecting' his body would violate his and their beliefs and 'strike at the heart of their religious identity'.

The controversy came to light during a legal challenge to prevent the autopsy at the High Court in London last week.

The judge Mr Justice Silber ruled that an invasive autopsy was the only way of finding out if there was 'third party involvement' in the Egyptian's death.

His sister Dr Sarah Aly initially supported the claim he has been murdered but later withdrew the accusation saying she was grief-stricken when she made it 'in the heat of the moment'.

She argued that 'cutting' the body would cause the family enormous distress and less intrusive toxicology tests, along with MRI scanning of his corpse, would be enough to dispel any suspicion that the doctor had been strangled.

Dr Sarah Aly said her family now believed there was nothing suspicious about the death and they should be allowed to have the body repatriated intact to Egypt.

Her barrister, Chris Williams, said an autopsy would breach the 'fundamental tenets' of the family's faith and amount to a violation of human rights to respect for family life and freedom of religion.

Can Yeginsu, for the coroner, said suspicions raised by the Egyptian media, and initially by Dr Sarah Aly herself, meant a thorough investigation had to be carried out.

Neither toxicology testing nor MRI scanning would rule out foul play, Mr Yeginsu told the judge.

He said other patients at the Welsh hospital might object to being scanned by a machine that had been used on a dead body.

Mr Yeginsu added that if the equipment were used on Dr Aly 'it would be very much a first, not only in Wales but probably in the United Kingdom'.

The coroner had also received firm 
advice that MRI scanning could not detect 'subtle pathology, such as 
pressure to the neck' and 'wouldn't be sufficient to rule out third 
party involvement'.

Local 
experience of using MRI equipment to scan dead bodies was 'non-existent'
and such techniques would not uncover 'subtle injuries that are found 
in some kinds of homicide'.

Mr Justice Silber said the police investigation was prompted by Dr Sarah Aly's initial 'very serious allegations to the effect that the deceased had been murdered' and the stories circulating in the Egyptian press.

Mr Justice Silber also said that although toxicology tests on Dr Aly's blood and urine might be effective in detecting the presence of any drugs, they would not reveal whether they were 'administered by a third party' or whether force was used.

With Dr Aly's body deteriorating, it was concluded that an invasive autopsy was the only viable means of investigation.

The coroner told the High Court that he had 'real regret' that an autopsy would entail 'further upset' to Dr Aly's family.

Mr Justice Silber also expressed his 'great sympathy' for the loss of a young man at the start of his medical career.
