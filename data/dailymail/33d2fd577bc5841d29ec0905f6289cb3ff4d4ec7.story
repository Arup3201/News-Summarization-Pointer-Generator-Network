Located 100 metres beneath the surface of a Chinese mountain, this nuclear bunker is a relic of the cold war.

In the 1960s Chairman Mao Zedong ordered regional governments across China to build nuclear bunkers in case of a surprise attack from the Soviet Union.

Many of the bunkers such as this one in Ruichang in the eastern Chinese Jianxi Province, abandoned for many years, are now being reborn as potential tourist attractions.

The cold war bunker is built into the side of a mountain in Ruichang in Jianxi Province, eastern China

The interior of the bunker is protected by two large blast doors which lead to an access corridor

Workers tunneled through solid rock to create the complex which was designed to survive a nuclear strike

A large number of these shelters were built across China. 

The construction project continued from the 1960s and into the 1970s as Chinese leadership were fearful over the intentions of their northern Communist neighbour. 

Some other bunkers are used in the summer to allow people spend time underground where the air temperature is considerably cooler allowing them to escape from the sweltering conditions. 

However, China is not the only country where they are trying to develop new uses for abandoned nuclear bunkers. 

One bunker built near Dundee in Scotland, which was built for £30 million was on sale earlier this year for just £200,000. 

The bunker is located at a former army camp in Cultybraggan, where Rudolf Hess was held for one night after he flew to the UK to negotiate with British authorities. 

This area appears to be a very basic latrine with a two troughs offering only the most rudimentary toilet facilities 

The bunker in Ruichang consists of just six rooms and an area set aside to act as an armoury as well as a control room

The abandoned structure has begun to look quite dilapidated as it has not been maintained in recent years 

At the very centre of the bunker, more than 100 metres below ground, designers built a high security armoury to hold weapons 

During the summer months, some locals are known to use the bunker in order to escape sweltering temperatures 

The bunker is accessed through the side of a mountain in a manner more commonly associated with the lair of a Bond villain

Many of these bunkers are no lying abandoned although some are being redesigned as potential tourist attractions
