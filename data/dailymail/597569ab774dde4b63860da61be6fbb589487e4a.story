A group of thugs followed a patron as he left a Philadelphia casino on Sunday night before abducting, shooting and robbing the 38-year-old of his winnings and leaving him for dead.

Police say the victim is fighting for his life in hospital following the incident at SugarHouse casino about 11.30pm Sunday night.

'Several' suspects are said to have followed the gambler in a light-colored work van labelled 'Soft Touch cleaning services' as he drove home in his black Cadillac.

When the victim reached St. Bernard Street and Springfield Avenue in Southwest Philadelphia, the robbers abducted the man from his car at gunpoint and threw him inside the van.

He was carrying almost $4000 cash he had won just before leaving the casino.

Evidence: Police have confirmed that at least six shots were fired during the robbery, based on casings found on the road near the victim's car. The casino patron was shot three times in the back and legs

The victim had spent the night gambling here, at the SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia, having won about $3,800 cash

The suspects duct taped the victim's hands and feet and then drove him around, beating him inside the van.

While police have confirmed at least six shots were fired, the main sustained three bullet wounds to his back and legs.

The suspects stole approximately $3,800 in cash - all of which was won at the casino - before dropping the victim off in the 7400 block of Summerdale Avenue in Northeast Philadelphia, behind Northeast high school in Rhawnhurst.

It was snowing at the time.

Investigators say the man's condition is extremely critical.

'He suffered very serious assault wounds to his face,' Chief Inspector Scott Small told CBS Philly.

'We know that at least six shots were fired from a large caliber semi-automatic handgun.

'We found six shell casings on the highway right where the victim collapsed after being shot.'

Police are investigating whether the bandits responsible targeted their victim from inside the casino and, if so, whether there is security footage of the suspects.

The victim was taken to Aria Torresdale hospital.

His name has not been released.

While the bandits fled the area, police are hopeful they will be able to track the van.

Anyone with information is urged to contact police.
