A man has been jailed for life after stabbing his girlfriend to death in a 'brutal, vicious and sustained attack' which was recorded in a terrifying voicemail message.

Daniel Hodges, 31, admitted stabbing 39-year-old Gillian Andrade to death in a jealous rage following a night out in Loughton, Essex.

The court sat in stunned silence as they heard a chilling voicemail message in which the mother-of-one pleaded for help just moments before she was brutally stabbed to death.

Daniel Hodges lied that girlfriend Gillian Andrade stabbed him, even cutting his own neck to seem convincing

Hodges was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a minimum term of 17 and a half years, when he appeared in the dock at Chelmsford Crown Court on Friday.

Judge Charles Gratwicke said: 'Those close to her have been left with an un-fillable void.

'No one who sat in this court this afternoon and listened to that recording can feel anything but shock and horror.

'This was a brutal, vicious and sustained attack.'

The couple had been enjoying a night out at Nu Bar - a popular nightspot for star of The Only Way is Essex in Loughton, Essex - on the night of the attack in July last year 2012.

Hodges launched into a jealous rage when the couple returned from the night out and he discovered a text message from Miss Andrade's gym instructor who he wrongly believed had been having an affair with her.

The court heard a harrowing voicemail in which jealous Hodges, who worked as an oil rigger, said: 'You're the last love of my life. You was my last love.'

Miss Andrade can be heard calling out to her nine-year-old daughter just moments before she suffered two fatal stab wounds to her back.

The cynical killer had tried to claim his partner had attacked him with the knife - even cutting himself in the neck after the attack in a twisted bid for sympathy before placing the knife in her hand.

But the damning voicemail message eventually forced Hodges to confess to the killing when he appeared at Chelmsford Crown Court last month.

SIO Det Chief Insp Lucy Robinson, from the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said: 'The incredibly thorough investigation by my investigation team and the overwhelming evidence we gathered against Mr Hodges no doubt influenced his decision to enter a guilty plea.

'Daniel Hodges was a controlling man with a violent temper. Gillian was a woman who was full of life; a loving mother, daughter and sister. Gillian had been in relationship with Mr Hodges and she trusted him. He abused that trust and selfishly, through his own violent jealousy, took Gillian's life away from her family.

'Gillian's family now have to face a future without her. I hope today's sentence is some form of comfort to them. At least Daniel Hodges is unable to hurt anyway else through his violence whilst he serves a life sentence for her murder.'

Gillian's mother, Mary Davey, paid tribute to her daughter following sentencing, saying: 'Gillian was a beautiful, kind person and anyone who came into contact with her couldn't fail to be touched by her positive outlook to life.

'The events of July 2012 have changed all our lives and we came today with no expectations other than to close this terrible chapter because nothing can ease our heartache or bring Gillian back.

'No sentence today can compare with the life sentence which was imposed on us last year and Gillian will always be loved and never forgotten.

'On behalf of my family I would like to thank Essex Police and Victim Support for all the help they have given us since this terrible event."

Grace Ononiwu, Chief Crown Prosecutor for East of England CPS, said: 'Hodges viciously murdered Gillian Andrade, a mother of one, in a jealous rage after mistakenly believing she was seeing someone else.

'His guilty plea reflects the strength of the prosecution's case, in particular a voicemail message that recorded his brutal crime.

'The guilty plea meant that the family and friends of Gillian did not have to go through a trial.

'I hope that the sentence today will bring some comfort to them at this difficult time.'
