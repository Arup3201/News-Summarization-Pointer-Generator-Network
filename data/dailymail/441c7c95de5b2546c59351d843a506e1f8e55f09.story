Alastair Bruce has a secret weapon. You can’t see it, or touch it, but his imaginary telephone line has proved vital in his role as historical advisor on Downton Abbey. 

An expert on protocol past and present, Alastair has brought his forensic knowledge of 20th-century history to bear on every series of the much-loved drama but the cast’s fondness for rather modern displays of affection is something of a bête noire for him – hence the imaginary phone line.

'I'm always trying to stop people hugging,' he exclaims. 'We've become so physically expressive as people – it’s a miracle we're ever unclamped from each other frankly, and the actors are very keen on it – but it’s just not the language of this period.

Expert: Alastair Bruce is the man in charge of ensuring Downton Abbey's period detail is perfect

'I feel an actor can convey gratitude, or all sorts of emotions, without physical contact – just as one has to over the telephone. 

'So I often suggest they imagine that the telephone line is there as a means of creating distance.'

He may be behind the scenes but Alastair is vital to the making of Downton, as the DVD of series five makes clear. 

In an accompanying exclusive documentary, he takes us through the bewildering minutiae of 1920s etiquette, illustrated by footage from the Downton set in which we see him scurrying around altering the position of a soup spoon here, the hankie in a tweed jacket pocket there.

For Alastair the devil is very much in the detail. At one point he gently chides Michelle Dockery’s Lady Mary for slouching in front of her Dowager Countess grandmother, at another he reminds Laura Carmichael’s Lady Edith that she would never leave her evening gloves on the table after dinner.

Detail: Mr Bruce is known to cast members as 'The Oracle' because of his exhaustive knowledge

Even Lord Grantham, played by Hugh Bonneville, doesn’t escape the odd ticking off, mostly for putting his hands in his pockets.

'Of course, all these things seem to be absolute nonsense now, but if you’re trying to take people legitimately on a journey in time you have to attend to these things to make it successful,' says Alastair.

It’s helpful to put him among the action now and then, to which end he’s cropped up variously on screen as a butler at the Dowager Countess’s Dower House, a Staff Colonel to a visiting General, and a river ghillie in the second year Christmas Special which saw the cast decamp to Scotland. 

Indeed, it is Alastair’s hands that hold the ruler over the knives and forks on the table every time the titles roll.

His crowning glory though came in last year’s Christmas Special, playing the Lord Chamberlain to King George V in the scenes where Lady Rose was presented at Court, a position from which he had the opportunity to supervise the behaviour of the key cast members during the ritual.

And it’s clear the cast think he’s marvellous. On set he’s nicknamed 'The Oracle', and the actors are fulsome in their praise.

'I love Alastair,' says Tom Cullen, who plays Lord Gillingham. 'He literally taught me everything, how to tie my shoelaces, how to stand, how to ride a horse.'

Hugh Bonneville, meanwhile, cites Alastair’s exhaustive knowledge of history as another great strength. 'He’s very useful in providing context for the interaction between characters,' he says.

Which is where that telephone line comes in. Although he’s not a director, Alastair usually gets his way when it comes to the cast doing things properly.

He cites a scene in series three, in which Lord Grantham and Matthew Crawley, played by Dan Stevens, came to an agreement over their future roles after months of conflict. 

'Hugh and Dan desperately wanted this hug at the end. So, OK, film it – nothing wrong with filming something,' he smiles. 

'But let’s film another version, in which they lightly tap each other’s shoulders instead.' The latter was the version that was used.

Cameo: Mr Bruce, seen here with director Liz Turbridge, also moonlights as an extra from time to time

Starring role: In season four, Mr Bruce had a cameo as the Lord Chamberlain in episode nine

Stiff: According to Mr Bruce, displays of affection and hugging weren't really done until the 1950s

Whenever a character has a storyline that touches on history, Alastair’s there to fill in the background. 

This includes Dame Maggie Smith, whose Dowager Countess had, we learned, possibly got a skeleton in her cupboard in the form of an illicit romance with a Russian aristocrat, now living in penury in England after the Russian Revolution of 1917. 

'Maggie and I talked about how these Russians came to be in Britain, that something like this happening suddenly seemed possible for the British aristocracy,' he recalls.

The principle challenge with the latest series, set in 1924, was persuading the cast that while times may have marched on, stiff manners still governed.

'They were saying, "Oh Alastair we're in the fifth series, can I relax a bit?" To which I told them, "You can relax a bit in about 1955".'

Alastair is something of a Renaissance Man: an author of well-received history books, he is Royal, Religious and National Events commentator for Sky and covered the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee for them in 2012. 

Royal life: During his stint as the Queen's herald, Mr Bruce persuaded her to be photographed at Balmoral

Tweaks: Mr Bruce spends hours checking and double checking place settings and table etiquette

Popular: Despite his restrictions on hugging, Mr Bruce is a hugely popular member of the Downton team

He’s not just an observer, but a part of the Establishment too: in 1998 the Queen appointed him as one of her heralds, and it was he who persuaded Her Majesty to be photographed in her regalia out among the peat and heather at a misty Balmoral for a book to mark the 60th anniversary of her Coronation, an image that graced Weekend magazine’s cover last year.

Despite his best efforts, the odd clanger slips through on Downton, much to the delight of the viewers who revel in pointing out inaccuracies. 

'It’s about reputation,' says Alastair. 'If you have a good reputation people want to attack it because it’s more fun – so in a way I look forward to challenges like that as it suggests I have standards.'

It’s impossible, at this point, not to bring up the plastic water bottle seen in the background of the publicity shots for this series. 

Was this a blot on Alastair’s almost-impeccable copybook? 'Oh, I'm perfectly happy to be held responsible for that,' he hoots. 

'A lot of people have said, "What about that plastic bottle?" and I'll admit I thought, "Crikey, if that’s about it, then I've done alright".'
