A plane from Houston on its way to New York City's LaGuardia Airport on Saturday had to make an emergency landing after an unruly passenger ran for the cockpit while telling the flight crew he had a bomb.

Victor Manguel allegedly bum-rushed the cockpit of United Flight 1435 after a scuffle with other passengers and had to be subdued with the help of four first class passengers.

Pilots were forced to land at Memphis, where authorities arrested Manguel before bringing in bomb-sniffing dogs and eventually giving pilots the okay to head to New York.

Unruly: United Flight 1435 passenger Victor Manguel allegedly charged the cockpit while claiming he had a bomb on Saturday while en route to New York City

Passenger Cookie Smith told KPRC that Manguel first argued with a passenger toward the back of the plane.

'He seemed a little off and he had a black eye. Like the whole white part of his eye was blood red,' said Smith.

After the scuffle in back, Smith said Manguel charged toward the cockpit as the flight attendant yelled for him to stop before asking passengers for assistance.

Among those who helped hold Manguel back was Smith's husband.

Smith told KPRC that Manguel said he had a gun, while other passengers reported that he claimedÂ  to have had a bomb.

Grounded: Manguel was taken off the plane, as were the 140 other passengers. He'd allegedly charged the cockpit after claiming he had a bomb. Authorities brought on explosives sniffing dogs before allowing the plane to go on to New York

Once the plane landed in Memphis and Manguel was hauled away by authorities as all the passengers were ushered out, bomb-sniffing canines were brought aboard.

'The FBI showed up and put a bomb-sniffing dog on the plane and we were told the plane had to be searched by this bomb-sniffing dog because the passenger had reported that there were some explosives on-board,' passenger Brent McCowan told WREG.

All 140 passengers were seriously inconvenienced by the Manguel, who's been charged by federal authorities with interfering with a flight crew.

However, McCowan said the flight crew handled the situation perfectly.

'There was no panic. There were no screams. There were no cries,' he said. 'The flight attendant did a great job with the way he handled the situation.'

Manguel now faces federal charges for interfering with a flight crew. The plane eventually made it to New York via Newark airport
