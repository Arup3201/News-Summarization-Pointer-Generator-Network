She has never had any trouble getting her sponges to rise – and it seems Mary Berry is just as adept at expanding her bank balance.

As the BBC’s Great British Bake Off returns to our screens for its fifth series tonight, the queen of cakes has whipped up an impressive business empire thought to be worth as much as £5million.

The 79-year-old’s popularity with viewers is paying dividends, and over the past year she has signed lucrative deals to produce kitchenware, published a string of bestselling books, seen sales of her range of sauces and chutneys soar and been paid to appear at food shows around the country.

Recipe for success: Great British Bake Off star Mary Berry has whipped up an impressive business empire thought to be worth as much as £5million

And all of this is on top of her estimated £200,000 annual salary for appearing on Bake Off, as well as a further sum for presenting her solo show Mary Berry Cooks on BBC2.

Miss Berry, who lives with her husband in a £2million house in Buckinghamshire, has now set up a network of companies to manage the spoils of her growing TV fame. Two of them – Mary Berry Ltd and Mary Berry Merchandising Ltd – were set up in the past eight months and have yet to file accounts. A third, Mary Berry and Daughter, is run with her daughter Annabel Bosher, 42, and made £1.2million last year.

Here is a breakdown of her booming  business empire:

Over a 50-year career, Miss Berry has established herself as a respected author with more than 70 cookbooks to her name. But her soaring TV popularity has helped her dominate the bestseller lists, earning an estimated £2.3million in the past eight years. She now writes most of the books with her assistant Lucy Young, and they currently have three – Mary Berry Cooks, Cook Now Eat Later and Simple Cakes – in the charts. Over Christmas, the official Bake Off recipe book beat Jamie Oliver to the top spot, and Miss Berry’s Christmas Collection, Complete Cookbook and Cookery Course all made the top ten. Last year, she published her autobiography, Recipe for Life, and this spring she released two iPad and iPhone cookery apps at £2.99 each.

Lucrative: Miss Berry started selling her own brand of salad dressing in 1994 with daughter Annabel, and last year she published her autobiography, Recipe for Life

Miss Berry started selling her own brand  of salad dressing in 1994 with daughter  Annabel. Since then they have expanded  the range to include a wide range of  sauces and chutneys that are stocked  in supermarkets and delicatessens around the country. Profits have soared from £34,374 in 1999 to £1.2million last year. A bottle of Mary Berry salad dressing costs £3.95, while her ploughman’s chutney is £2.49 and her hollandaise sauce is £1.80.

When she is not filming, Miss Berry tours the country giving talks and cookery demonstrations believed to earn her four-figure sums each time. Over the summer, the sought-after chef is set to appear at food fairs in Herefordshire, Hampshire, Chatsworth, Newbury and Bristol, and will open the Royal Horticultural Society’s Wisley Flower Show in September. She has given sell-out talks at Fortnum & Mason in London and is a regular at the Good Food Show, which has events around the country.

Thanks to her high profile, Miss Berry has been able to sign five-figure merchandising deals and lend her name to two personalised kitchenware ranges. One, with Lakeland, includes a pastel pink apron for £16.99, oven gloves for £13.99 and a 12-hole cupcake tin for £24.99. Another, with Sainsbury’s, includes a two-tier cake stand for £15.99, a ceramic bowl for £20 and a set of mugs – printed with catchphrases from Bake Off – for £8.
