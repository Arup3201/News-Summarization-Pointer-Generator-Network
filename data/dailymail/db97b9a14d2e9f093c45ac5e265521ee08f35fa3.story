Starbucks is selling a limited edition coffee blend that is so rare it will only be available in stores for one week. 

The Nicaragua Laurina 'reserve' is currently available in just 20 select Starbucks stores in the United States, all of which have been flooded with requests from coffee lovers eager to get hold of the rare bean - which is being sold for $16 per half pound, more than double the amount of many of Starbucks' other more traditional offerings.  

Despite the coffee's hefty price tag, many of the stores in which the Nicaraguan blend was being sold have already run out of stock, less than 24 hours after the beans became available to the public.

'Sold out of Nicaragua Laurina, it didn't last a day! #tobeapartner #sbuxyard @Sbuxbos @SBUXRoastery @starbucksprtnrs (sic)' California-based barista Ronnie Varela tweeted. 

'Hopefully I can get to #sbuxyard in time tonight to buy some #NicaraguaLaurina (sic)' another added. 

According to Starbucks-focused blogger Starbucks Melody, the popular coffee company was only able to obtain 17 bags of the unique coffee bean from the farmer, which totals just 750lbs after the beans have been roasted. 

'It’s considered a “micro lot” which is a smaller yield of coffee than a “small lot” coffee, usually found at Starbucks Reserve locations,' Melody explains on her website. 

The coffee-loving blogger also offered up her thoughts on the flavor of the unique bean, noting: 'The Nicaragua Laurina is a beautiful medium body coffee with lots almond-y sweetness and some sweet lemon notes.'

She added: 'The Nicaragua Laurina comes from a coffee tree with a smaller shrub and leaves, which produces a bean that is small, slender, and looks a bit like grains of rice.'

According to Melody's website, the coffee, which was roasted at the Starbucks Reserve Roastery on March 10, was sent out to each of the 20 Starbucks stores that were chosen to stock it on their shelves either via Fed-Ex, for those locations outside of Seattle, or hand-delivered by car to those venues based in Starbucks' hometown. 

it is not the first time that Starbucks has offered such a rare - and expensive - coffee variety to its most dedicated fans. 

In November 2012, the coffee company sold a limited supply of Costa Rica Finca Palmilera beans, which retailed at an impressive $40 for just half a pound of beans.
