This is the moment an escaped monkey was apparently photographed on the loose in a public park.

The hairy black creature was spotted by stunned Terri Leigh Cox as she looked out of her bedroom window that overlooks the play park in Dorchester, Dorset.

She witnessed the animal hunched over and bounding around on all fours before she grabbed her mobile phone and took a single frame of it.

Miss Cox, 17, said the creature then scampered up a tree and out of sight.

A student spotted what she thinks was a monkey wandering around her local park in Dorchester, Dorset

Her boyfriend Shaun Bessant dashed out a few minutes later to look for the monkey-like creature but found no sign of it.

Miss Cox spotted the beast about 100 yards away from her home.

The park is about 10 miles away from the famous Monkey World attraction in Wool, although staff there have not reported any lost primates.

She said she is certain the mysterious animal was not a dog or cat and believes it was a monkey that may be an escaped pet.

'It was such a shock I couldn't believe what I was seeing at first,' the health and social care student said.

Miss Cox said: 'It looked about the size of a silver back gorilla. It was ambling like one as well, on its arms and feet'

'It looked about the size of a small gorilla. It was walking like one as well, using its arms and feet.

'It was definitely a monkey because you could tell by its hunched back and the way it scampered across the field and up the tree. It wasn't a black dog.

'I managed to get a photo but it quickly went out of sight. I couldn't see it very clearly.

'When I tried to get another shot it had disappeared.

'I have no idea what the monkey was doing there.

It could have escaped if someone was keeping it as a pet.'

A spokeswoman for Monkey World said all of its monkeys and apes were accounted for.

She said: 'The image is not clear and it is difficult to make out, so we would be unable to confirm its identity.

'I can confirm that all of our rescued monkeys and apes are safe and well in the park.'

Many residents and dog walkers at the park have expressed their shock at the sighting.

Derek Dodd said: 'I have seen a lot of wildlife on these fields but a monkey-like creature isn't one of them.'

Rob Samways, who lives nearby, said: 'I'll be keeping my eyes peeled from now. I supposed somebody could have been keeping it as a pet and it has escaped.'

Wrapped up warm: Darwin the macaque had his coat on for his shopping trip

Last December, shoppers at Ikea in Toronto were surprised to see a stylishly dressed monkey roaming around the carpark unaccompanied.

Darwin the Japanese macacque monkey, who was wrapped up warmly in a shearling coat and nappy, ambled about the homeware store, posing for photographs by bemused Christmas shoppers, before he was caught by animal welfare authorites.

It later transpired he had escaped from owner Yasmin Nakhuda who then faced a fierce custody battle with local animal care authorities to get her pet back.

Teddy Bear the cat, aka the Essex Lion

Last August, the residents of Clacton on Sea in Essex locked themselves indoors in a panic after it was reported that a large lion was prowling through a nearby stubble field.

Armed officers and two police helicopters using heat-seeking equipment, which cost £880 an hour to run, were scrambled in a bid to track down the wild animal.

Workers from nearby Colchester Zoo carrying tranquilliser guns scoured the fields and residents were warned to stay indoors. Caravanners were temporarily moved to a nearby garden centre.

However when 50-year-old fitness instructor Ginny Murphie saw the blurry images of the wild beast on the news, she realised that it was in fact her fluffy pet cat, Teddy Bear.

Mrs Murphie, who was away from her St Osyth home in Essex at the time, said: 'I knew straightaway it was Teddy, he's been mistaken for a fox before.'
