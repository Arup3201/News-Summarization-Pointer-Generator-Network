Early starter: Robert Knowles (pictured in May), 66, of Plymouth, Devon, began his criminal career aged 13

After his 185th court appearance and 332nd conviction, there are very few people who can rival the criminal record of Robert Knowles.

Now the 66-year-old from Plymouth, Devon, is back behind bars again after being jailed for eight months for stealing from a Marks & Spencer store.

Knowles, who lives in a hostel, began his criminal career aged just 13 and has astonishingly appeared in court every year since 1959.

A judge told the alcoholic at Plymouth Crown Court that it was ‘the end of the road’, as he locked up Knowles for eight months.

The thief was brought before the court for stealing from an M&S store on successive days.

He has had 197 out of his 332 convictions for theft by shoplifting, prosecutor Alistair Verheijen said, adding that M&S staff allowed him to go free after he was caught with two bottles of whisky worth £70 on June 10.

But he returned the next day and stole wine, chicken and boxer shorts worth £30. This time he was arrested by police. The court heard he had been in court twice this year for shoplifting - receiving a fine a week before his latest spree.

His barrister Ali Rafati said he was an unwell man and needed a CT (computerised tomography) scan, adding: ‘He does not seem to be able to cope with life on the outside at the moment.’

He said Knowles is now ‘institutionalised’ and steals so that he can go back to prison on his release.

Judge Paul Darlow said: ‘You have had 184 court appearances. We have reached the end of the road. I am sure you will be able to get the CT scan you need in prison.’

Knowles was sent to a correctional school in 1959 and has been adding to his criminality ever since.

The Crown Prosecution Service has been unable to provide a full breakdown of his lifetime of offending because many of the crimes pre-dated its creation in 1986.

Last year Knowles was jailed for stealing whisky miniatures the day after finishing a spell in prison.

Plymouth Crown Court heard he had £160 in his pocket at the time – and knew perfectly well he would be sent back to jail.

Recorder Robin Belben told him at last October’s hearing: ‘You have been caught in a revolving door over the last two or three years.

‘You commit an offence, you go to prison – and you commit another as soon as you are released.’

Knowles is said to be ‘resigned to spending the rest of his life in prison’ because he is unable to cope with living outside jail.

In June 2011 Knowles admitted the theft of two bottles of whisky, watches and socks worth £279 from Marks and Spencer.
