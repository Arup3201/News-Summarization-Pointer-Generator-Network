A man walked into a nail salon, poured flammable liquid over his head and set himself alight after arguing with his estranged wife, the salon manager.

The 46-year-old man, who has not been named, is being treated for third degree burns after salon staff put out the flames.

Customer Sherry Skipper-Spurgeon said the manager, named only as Lina, sobbed in her arms for an hour after the incident at noon yesterday at Creative Nails and Spa in Costa Mesa, Orange County.

The man was being treated at the Western Medical Center in Santa Ana for third degree burns

She told the Orange County Register that the man, who was carrying a bucket, was 'really distraught' as he screamed at his wife in Vietnamese.

Lina told her staff and three customers to leave while she spoke to her husband but he poured the contents of the bucket over his head before sitting down in a puddle of flammable liquid.

'Next thing you know, someone says "He's got a lighter!",' Ms Skipper-Spurgeon said.

'As I'm talking to the fire department, he lights himself on fire, and there's a fireball. The flames are completely covering his head, and then there's this poof of smoke.'

Lina's brother, who was helping her fix some electrical problems, used a fire extinguisher on the flames engulfing his brother-in-law while salon staff smothered the fire with towels.

The couple, who have three children, are believed to be in the middle of a divorce.

'This is absolutely devastating for her,' Ms Skipper-Spurgeon said. 'She didn't know how she was going to tell her kids about this.'

The man was taken to Western Medical Center in Santa Ana for treatment. Nobody else was injured.
