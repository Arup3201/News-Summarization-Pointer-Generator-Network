All companies are under a legal obligation to protect the species  

A building firm has had to spend more than £1million catching newts – because they are a protected species.

Around
 150 great crested newts have had to be relocated from land set aside 
for new homes, costing developers Gallagher Estates an average of £6,700
 per creature.

The newts were in the way of building work on a 900-acre site in Milton Keynes.

And the project was held up for a year while wildlife experts rounded them up and took them to specially created ponds.

All
 companies have a legal obligation to protect the species and anyone 
harming them can face prosecution and possibly even prison.

The company is due to build 6,500 new homes, four schools and a village centre at the site, west of the city.

Charles
 Brindley, town clerk of Stony Stratford Town Council, said: ‘A report 
from the firm mentioned the astronomical amount of money spent 
collecting a relatively small number of newts.’

Residents have 
criticised the cost of removing the newts.

Local resident, Holly, wrote 
online: ‘This is a ridiculous amount of money to be spent on newts! With
 NHS schools under pressure to perform with less money, you go spending 
on this – it beggars belief.’

Philip Blowfield, a Ukip local election candidate, said: ‘As a result of this enormous effort, only 150 newts were found.

‘The
 expense, delay and priority given to this rather privileged minority is
 difficult to justify. What a waste of time and money when so many 
people are in need.’

It’s not the first time the protection of newts 
has held up important building works.

Last year the construction of a 
multi-million pound police headquarters for the Durham Constabulary was 
halted to protect just one newt.

Police chiefs expressed their 
frustration at the hold-up as the new £14million headquarters in Aykley 
Heads, Durham was expected to save them about £2,000 a day in running 
costs.

And in 2012, engineers building the UK’s largest deep-sea port
 had to relocate about 350,000 animals, including 5,000 great crested 
newts, before beginning construction.
