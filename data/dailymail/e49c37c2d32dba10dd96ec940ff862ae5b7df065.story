Jamie Carragher has labelled Newcastle’s players a disgrace following their 4-0 defeat to Southampton while Gary Neville has described the Magpies squad as ‘letdowns’.

Newcastle supporters have grown frustrated with manager Alan Pardew after the club’s disappointing start to the season but Carragher believes the players are to blame.

Speaking on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football, Carragher, describing Newcastle’s lacklustre display at St Mary’s said: ‘There’s lots of talk about Alan Pardew but some of those players are a disgrace.

‘This isn’t an end of season game. This is four or five games into a season.’

‘I played against some of these players towards the end of my time with Liverpool. We beat them 6-0 at St James’ Park. The performance is shocking.

‘Fans go there and you all want to see players do great things but you also want to see a bit of graft, a bit of heart, a bit of intensity.

‘For Newcastle to be seen like that now, for the last few years, it’s a disgrace.’

Fellow pundit Neville was just as damming and said: ‘I wouldn’t want to be manager of those players, personally. I really wouldn’t. They’re just a letdown as far as I’m concerned.

Asked if Pardew was getting a raw deal at Newcastle, former Manchester United defender Neville replied: ‘I don’t think he’s getting a raw deal. He knows the job, he’s been there four years; it’s a pressurised job. 

'Alan Pardew has been around the block and he knows what’s coming if he doesn’t get results’, before adding: ‘It’s not all down to him (Pardew). There’s certain things above him. Have they invested as much as they should for a club of Newcastle’s size with that crowd and that fan base? Probably not.

‘There are a number of things which are factors in what you’re seeing at the moment. You can’t put it all on Pardew.’

Talking of the unrest amongst Newcastle’s fans, Carragher added: ‘Those supporters have turned so far it [Pardew’s position as boss] might become untenable.’
