The loot from robbing two teenagers was too sweet to resist for an Adelaide thief.

Just days after a new Krispy Kreme store opened in West Croydon - north-west of Adelaide - a man threatened the pair with a knife and took their six boxes of doughnuts from a car parked on Malcolm Street, which is right around the corner from the franchise.

About 9.40pm on Wednesday, the suspect demanded the victims to remain in the car while he opened the back passenger door and stole the doughnuts that had been purchased minutes before from the Port Road business, and ran off.

Two teenage boys were robbed at knife-point of their Krispy Kreme doughnuts in Adelaide's north-west

Neither of the teenagers were hurt in the robbery and the thief did not demand anything else.

South Australia police describe the man as Caucasian, about 165cm tall, between the ages of 16-20 years old, and he was wearing a black-hooded jumper and black trackpants.

The man was last seen running south on Malcolm Street.

Inspector Kevin Lawton told Nine News Adelaide that the robbery was a very serious offence.

'Anybody that is threatened with a knife and property taken from them - it is quite traumatic for them,' he said.

The pair were in a car about 9.40pm on Wednesday on Malcolm Street, just around the corner from the store

More than 1,000 people queued up for Monday's opening of the first Krispy Kreme store in Adelaide

A SA police spokesman said they were investigating a number of leads.

'They are from information that has been received from the public and witnesses,' he said.

The robbery comes after the Krispy Kreme store - the first for Adelaide - opened to popular demand on Monday.

Nine News reported more than 1,000 people had queued up to be some of the first people to get their hands on the store's famous glazed doughnuts.

Krispy Kreme's Mark Higginbottom said he hoped the incident had not put the teenagers off the delicious treats.

'[Doughnuts] are best shared but it's best shared without any aggression and violence,' he told Nine News.

'I'd certainly like to see them and do my little bit to make them feel a little better if that's possible.'

Police urge anyone with information about the robbery to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or report online sa.crimestoppers.com.au.
