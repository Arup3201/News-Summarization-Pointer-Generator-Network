It is a measure of Arsenal’s progress that fixtures like these no longer end in boos and angry recrimination. As the final whistle approached, the crowd at the Emirates were unusually vocal, anticipating trips to Wembley and singing praise of their team.

Earlier it had the feel of one of the afternoons with which we have become so familiar in recent years, one of those days when Arsenal break world records for possessions stats but come up against an inspired goalkeeper and end the day with fans furious at their manager, the board of directors and life in general.

But with Olivier Giroud in exceptional form, Aaron Ramsey also outstanding and Mesut Ozil thriving against the kind of opposition he relishes, Arsenal eventually cantered to victory in some style.

Better measures of their real progress remain, of course. On Tuesday night they visit Monaco where you might anticipate another glorious comeback which ultimately ends in failure. Then there will be the league table at the end of the season which will likely tell the tale of an opportunity missed to challenge for the title.

Arsene Wenger conceded that, even with Chelsea still to come to the Emirates, Arsenal are not yet in the title race. ‘Not at the moment,’ he said. ‘But we can just keep going. We won eight of the last nine. We are stronger today than we were at the start of the season.

‘We suffered a lot from the World Cup, where the players came back. What is for sure is that they understand each other much better than six or seven months ago and that makes everyone more dangerous.’

At least Arsenal are not going backwards these days; the problem may be that they aren’t moving forwards fast enough but they are at least pointing in the right direction.

West Ham manager Sam Allardyce looked as though he understood as much and had settled for one of those afternoons when he aims to ‘out-tactic’ the opposition.

You could hardly blame him given the resources at his disposal, with Enner Valencia and James Tomkins the latest additions to his injury list and Carl Jenkinson ineligible.

Kevin Nolan almost shocked Arsenal with a clean strike on 23 minutes but at half-time, Arsenal had 74 per cent of the possession.

At times it looked as if West Ham goalkeeper Adrian was has having one of those inspired afternoon. It was later revealed he was playing with a dislocated finger sustained in the warm up, a fact which made his performance truly heroic. ‘He’s been a brave lad,’ said assistant manager Neil McDonald.

Theo Walcott was having a less satisfactory time. Thrust back in for his first start in more than a month, he did little to help his ongoing contract talks. Three times he was presented with the opportunity to open the scoring; three times he spurned the chances.

He could plead mitigation for the first effort on six minutes. A delightful back heel from Giroud set him up with just Adrian to beat, but James Collins came through the man and the ball to prevent him scoring.

It might have been a penalty but it was Walcott’s own hesitation in front of goal which had presented Collins with the chance to launch his saving tackle.

Adrian would then make excellent saves from Alexis Sanchez’s header on 16 minutes and from an improvised touch of the knee from Ramsey on 32 minutes, before Walcott received his next chance. Played in by a delightful Ramsey pass, he took a touch, looked up and struck his shot directly at the goalkeeper.Adrian denied Sanchez from a half volley and on 44 minutes he pushed away a strike from Ozil, which landed at Walcott’s feet, yards from goal but he skewed the ball high and wide, appearing to lose his balance.

Giroud was on hand to provide deliverance just before half-time. Ramsey and Ozil exchanged a delicate one-two, but such is the Frenchman’s confidence these days, he nicked it off Ramsey’s foot, took a touch and drove a fine finish into the far corner of the net.

‘It was fantastic because of the combination and the finishing. It was the kind of goal we loved to score,’ said Wenger.

It was his 14th goal of the season in 24 games. That Monaco game aside, he is having an excellent season and since that dismal night, he has responded incredibly well.

‘It’s one of his strengths,’ said Wenger, who called his performance ‘outstanding’.

Having set out to defend in numbers, a change of strategy was necessary for West Ham and they were equal to the challenge.

They came out in the second-half with an entirely different mindset, pushing Arsenal back into their half and searching for an equaliser.

In terms of clear-cut chances there was still little — Matt Jarvis’ curling cross which Ospina spilled and almost let in Sakho was one unsettling moment. But Arsenal were no longer able to play as they wished.

Still, their time would come. On 80 minutes, Giroud dummied a throw-in to let in Ramsey, who played in the Frenchman.

He returned the ball to Ramsey, who drove it past Adrian to cap a fine a performance of growing authority.

Three minutes later Santi Cazorla, on as a substitute, exchanged passes with Giroud and planted a cross almost on the foot of Mathieu Flamini, who had the simplest task of converting from close range for the third goal.
