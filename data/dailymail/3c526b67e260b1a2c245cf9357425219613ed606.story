Jailed: Christopher Lunn, 67, committed sex attacks on three different girls over more than 40 years

A paedophile has been jailed after the parents of an 11-year-old girl found a price list of sexual acts and financial rewards he had tried to bribe her with.

Christopher Lunn, 67, committed sex attacks on three different girls over more than 40 years but was only caught when the schoolgirl’s hand written note was found in her room.

Police then discovered that he had committed similar offences with young girls of the same age in the early 1970s and the mid 1980s after befriending their families and grooming his victims with treats.

The note written by his most recent victim, from Exmouth, Devon, started: 'Touch £5, Feel £4, Video £10' then moved on to other sexual acts for which the reward was £10 or £35.

In the past he had bribed other girls with sweets, crisps and chocolate, Exeter Crown Court was told.

The abuse had devastating long term psychological effects on the historic victims, one of whom had met him by chance in a pub many years later and denounced him as 'a dirty little pervert'.

Retired van driver Lunn, of Topsham, near Exeter, admitted sexual activity with a child and seven charges of indecency or indecent assault.

He was jailed for seven years by Judge John Neligan who told him: 'Some of these offences go back 40 years and during those in the 1980s you bought the girl’s affection with chocolate.

'You took advantage of these young girls, some of whom are now mature ladies with families of their own. They have suffered psychologically from what you did to them as children.'

Mr Sean Brunton, prosecuting, said Lunn was arrested after a family from Exmouth who he had befriended called the police.

He said: 'The 11-year-old girl had gone upstairs with him on occasions and her parents found a note which said ‘touch £5, feel £4’ and carried on with other prices.

In court: Exeter Crown Court was told Lunn had bribed girls before with chocolate, sweets and crisps in the 1970s and 1980s. He has been jailed for seven years

'She then told her parents he had touched her through her knickers, although the note suggests it went further than that.'

He said the parents then learned of an earlier incident in which Lunn had been confronted in a pub by a woman who he abused at the age of 11. They traced her and put her in touch with the police.

A third woman later came forward to reveal she had been abused in the 1980s and given chocolate after being touched by Lunn.

Mr Brunton said: 'He was arrested and interviewed and his account of his actions was a masterclass in denial, self justification and minimisation of what happened.'

He said the older victims made statements detailing how the abuse had affected them in later life, making adult relationship difficult and in one case leading to agoraphobia.

Mr David Evans, defending, said Lunn deserved credit for pleading guilty and sparing the victims the ordeal of giving evidence.

He said: 'Many people in his position remain in denial but he has accepted his responsibility and is trying to understand why he did what he did.

'He is never again going to be in a position where he has any access to children and the sex offender register provisions will ensure the authorities keep a watchful eye on him.'
