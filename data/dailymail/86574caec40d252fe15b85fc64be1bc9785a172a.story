When it comes to emotional films, most people think of the likes of Titanic, Watership Down and Up – but a new mobile phone advert gives them all a run for their money in the tear-jerking stakes.

It has already been viewed over three and a half million times on YouTube, with over 40,000 likes and hundreds of users commenting on how emotional it is.

The three-minute video, by phone company True Move H, begins with a small boy being chased out of a pharmacy by the owner, who’s caught him stealing.

Scroll down for video

The video begins with a boy being caught stealing from a pharmacy and labelled a thief

A cafe owner intervenes and pays for the medicine that the boy was stealing for his mum

She snatches the medicine he’s taken out of his hands and demands to know what he’s planning on doing with it.

He replies that he wants to give the medicine to his mum.

At this point a man from a nearby cafe comes over and calms the situation down by paying the pharmacy owner for the stolen items. He hands the boy the medicine and tells his daughter to fetch him some food, too.

The boy runs off and the film jumps forward 30 years, with the café owner still plying his trade with his daughter’s help.

Suddenly, to the horror of his daughter, he collapses. She is distraught as he lays unconscious in hospital and horrified that she’s been hit with a £15,500 medical bill.

The film jumps forward 30 years - to the horror of the cafe owner collapsing and ending up unconscious in hospital

The man's daughter is distraught at the size of the medical bill she's been hit with

She talks to the doctor who’s attending to her father looking numb with shock.

Desperate – she puts her house up for sale to cover the cost.

The next scene shows her asleep with her head on her father’s bed. Upon waking, she finds a new medical bill in an envelope next to her. The amount? Nothing at all.

A note with the bill explains that ‘all expenses have been paid, with three packs of painkillers and a bag of veggie soup’.

The daughter eventually receives a note from the doctor in charge of her father's case that explains that his act of kindness all those years ago has reduced the bill to zero

It turns out that the doctor tasked with saving her dad  is the same boy that he helped all those years ago after he stole medicine from the pharmacy.

‘Giving is the best communication’ states the ad at the end.

The video has been pulling the heart-strings of users all over the world.

Patricia Carroll described it as ‘beautiful and inspiring’, Barbara Vanessa Baledo as ‘so touching and CaPasseLeTemps as ‘simply wonderful’.
