Shattered dreams: The aspiring model sobbed as she recalled her alleged attack

A teenage girl who dreamed of being a model was allegedly drugged and sexually assaulted by a photographer who duped her into a photoshoot.

The 16-year-old trusted the photographer after posing for him a number of times in Greenwood, Indianapolis.

But the photographer - who promised to send off her photos to modelling agencies to help her become famous - gradually persuaded her to start posing in lingerie for racier shoots, she and her mother say.

Fox59 news reported
that the girl was given ten vodka shots, then drugged, before the 
sexual predator filmed himself sexually assaulting her and then taking 
nude photos of her.

Medical
tests revealed that she had been drugged with methamphetamine and 
opiates and had been sexually abused, the news website reported.

Speaking to the news website, the victim sobs: 'It was like I wasn't all there, I was gone and then I was like aware... he was on top of me.'

The devastated teenager said that all she had wanted to do was make some money and perhaps be famous.

But her mother says the photographer took advantage of her dream by telling her if she posed in her underwear he would send the pictures to lingerie chain Victoria's Secret.

Her heartbroken mother wept as she 
told Fox59 news that after attending multiple shoots with her daughter, 
she trusted the man to let him take her daughter's photo alone in his 
studio.

But she claims that DNA tests taken from the girl after the night match samples taken from the photographer.

She
claimed that the man preys on vulnerable girls who have no father 
figure and single mothers struggling to raise their children with no 
help.

Her mother says her daughter's dreams have been stolen and that she cannot bear the thought of her daughter having to live with memories of the alleged assault.

She told Fox59: 'I have to live with the regret that I let her go without me.'

Assistant Greenwood Police Chief Matt Fillenwarth told Fox 59 News that detectives are searching the photographer's computer hard drive before they charge him.
