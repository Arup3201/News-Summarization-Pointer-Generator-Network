Amanda Knox has been photographed having a tearful tryst with her American boyfriend, during which she handed him $100 in cash.

The accused woman was spotted travelling from her home for a secret rendezvous with boyfriend James Terrano in a Seattle park on Wednesday.

During the emotional hour-long meeting, she could be seen sobbing and speaking animatedly to Terrano, before cuddling up to him against a wall.

At one point, the University of Washington student was also pictured reaching into her purse and withdrawing what appeared to be $100 in cash.

The mystery meeting comes just days after Knox's Italian ex-boyfriend contradicted her account of the night of the murder of 21-year-old English student Meredith Kercher.

Strained: During the emotional hour-long meeting, Knox could be seen sobbing and speaking animatedly to Terrano, before cuddling up to him against a wall (pictured). The mystery meeting comes days after Knox's Italian ex-boyfriend contradicted her account of the night of the murder of 21-year-old English student Meredith Kercher

In
 January, an Italian judge re-convicted 26-year-old Knox and her former 
partner Raffaele Sollecito of killing Miss Kercher, who was found dead in a pool of blood in the bedroom of her home she 
shared with Knox in Perugia, Italy, on November 2, 2007. Her
 throat had been slashed and she had been sexually assaulted.

Both
 Knox and Sollecito have always denied any involvement in Miss Kercher's 
death, claiming that they spent the evening at Sollecito's place getting
 high, having sex and watching a movie.

But earlier this week, the 30-year-old Italian's lawyer said that Sollecito could not be sure that Knox was with him for the first part of the evening.

The lawyer has pointed to phone records showing that Knox was away from his house –
 information that he plans to use as an alibi to try to prove his 
innocence. However, he insisted he wasn't trying to pin the murder on the American.

It has also recently been reported that Italian prosecutors are preparing 
to use Knox's alleged ties to a cocaine dealer to extradite her back to 
Italy.

Court
 documents allegedly showed that the exchange student had 
called a drug dealer in the days before and after Miss Kercher was killed.

Tears: The Washington University student was photographed crying during the secret rendezvous with boyfriend James Terrano. Earlier this week, it was also reported that Italian prosecutors are preparing to use Knox's alleged ties to a cocaine dealer to extradite her back to Italy

Embrace: After looking close to tears Amanda has a hug with Terrano

Relief: In a lighter moment during their rendezvous the pair look relaxed and happy as they both break into natural smiles while chatting in a park

Serious: The pair appeared to be having a deep conversation in the Seattle park after Amanda handed over what appeared to be a wad of cash

More upbeat: The couple did, however, smile during their meeting. Terrano wore a Knicks hat while Amanda was similarly dressed down showing her newly cropped hair 

Speaking of Knox and Terrano's park rendezvous this week, an eyewitness said: ‘It seemed very strange and 
Amanda is clearly in a very bad place right now, because she broke down 
crying several times.

‘It
 looks as though she and James may be having major relationship trouble,
 if they are even together still. It was also strange that they went all
 the way to this secluded park to exchange money – perhaps they didn’t 
want anyone to see what they were up to?’

Close-up images appear to show Knox looking relieved after the meetup. The
 pair then embraced and her spirits were noticeably lifted as she and 
Terrano shared a tender hug. Later, the two went their separate ways 
looking visibly downcast. 

The eyewitness added: ‘They hugged one more time and Amanda kept looking over her shoulder, back at James as she walked away.

‘It really looked like they were breaking up with each other, but who knows why she paid him?’

Comfort: Amanda holds on to Terrano's hand tightly as they walk through the Seattle park

New look: In an appearance dramatically altered from her days in Perugia, Amanda was seen sporting a boyish haircut and glasses, wearing pink harem pants, a tank top adorned with crosses and a pair of black clogs with socks

Under pressure: The couple visited a coffee shop as part of the date and appeared locked in meaningful conversation. Amanda Knox has suffered a series of blows to her legal case in recent days with even her ex-boyfriend and co-accused Raffaele Sollecito stating that he thinks her story has anomalies

Prior
 to their clandestine date in the park, Knox and Terrano had met at a 
Seattle coffee shop, where the accused student was seen breaking down in 
tears and wiping her eyes during a tense encounter that lasted over an 
hour.

The witness
 said: ‘She had her glasses off and was sobbing. Terrano was side by 
side next to her, and they were clearly having a very animated 
discussion.

‘At
 one point she was writing something down in a book. She got up several 
times to go to the bathroom, presumably to wipe her eyes and fix herself
 up.’

Sporting
 a boyish haircut and glasses, Knox was photographed during the park 
rendezvous wearing pink harem pants, a tank top adorned with crosses and
 a pair of black clogs with socks.

Knox, who turns 27 later this month, has been in the U.S. since 2011. She has vowed she would never
 'willingly' return to Italy to face her fate in court.

Anxious: Amanda chews her nails and looks nervous as she checks her phone after seeing Terrano

Dressed down: Amanda Knox was dowdily dressed 
for the meeting with her boyfriend James Terrano. She looked anxious as 
she waited for the young man and removed her long-sleeved top to reveal a
 pair of mismatched vests underneath

She
 left the country right after an earlier appeals court ruling overturned
 the initial lower court conviction that had led to her imprisonment 
abroad.

Knox has said she is hopeful Italian courts will 'once again recognize' her innocence.

The
 January ruling against Miss Knox included a 28-1/2-year prison sentence
 for her and a 25-year sentence for her co-defendant, Sollecito.

The pair had previously served four years in prison for the murder,
before an appeals court acquitted them in 2011.

Rudy Hermann Guede, an Ivorian man, was convicted separately in the slaying and sentenced to 16 years in prison.

The appeals
 panel that reinstated the conviction against Knox in her British 
roommate's 2007 murder said that the American herself delivered the 
fatal blow out of a desire to ‘overpower and humiliate’ the victim.

Concerned: Amanda appears anxious as she talks to Terrano in the park. At one point she looked as if she was crying

Close: Terrano hugs Amanda after she appeared to become upset during their meeting on Wednesday
