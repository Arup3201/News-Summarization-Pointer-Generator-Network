British holidaymakers who are looking to cash in on the strength of the pound should look to Europe for an affordable getaway in 2015, new research has revealed.

European resorts and cities are this year’s best-value holiday hotspots, claiming eight of the top ten places in an annual study by Post Office Travel Money, and five are destinations that have the euro.

With the euro and other currencies looking increasingly fragile against the pound, the cheapest destination for UK tourists (excluding the price of flights and accommodation) is Prague, followed by the Algarve in Portugal and Sunny Beach in Bulgaria.

Prague was the cheapest of 46 destinations included in a recent Post Office Travel Money study

Eight typical items purchased by British holidaymakers, including water and beer, cost £35.29 in Prague 

Based on the average total cost of eight items typically purchased by British tourists:

Prague, Czech Republic (£35.29)

Algarve, Portugal (£36.04)

Sunny Beach, Bulgaria (£36.14)

Costa del Sol, Spain (£36.80)

Kuta, Bali (£38.09)

Budapest, Hungary (£40.87)

Crete, Greece (£41.74)

Cape Town, South Africa (£42.96)

Paphos, Cyprus (£43.71)

Marmaris, Turkey (£46.15)

Based on the average total cost of eight items typically purchased by British tourists: 

Singapore (£149.65)

Dubai (£144.50)

Auckland, New Zealand (£126.70)

Muscat, Oman (£120.13)

English Harbour, Antigua (£117.39)

St James, Barbados (£104.59)

Darwin, Australia (£103.34)

Penang, Malaysia (£93.32)

Vancouver, Canada (£91.24)

Beijing, China (£89.26)

Post Office Travel Money ranked 46 popular destinations based on the average total price of eight typical purchases by British tourists: a cup of coffee, bottle of beer, a can of Coca-Cola or Pepsi, a glass of wine, a 1.5-litre bottle of mineral water, sun cream, a pack of cigarettes and a three-course evening meal for two with a bottle of house wine.

In Prague, the average total for all eight items is just £35.29, with the evening meal and house wine accounting for most of the cost (£21.28).

For those same items tourists would spend £36.04 in the Algarve (the cheapest beach resort on the list and last year’s runner-up), £36.14 in Sunny Beach, Bulgaria, £36.80 in Spain’s Costa del Sol, and £38.09 in Kuta, Bali, last year’s No 1 and the only non-European destination in this year’s top five.

For the second year in a row the Algarve is second on the list and Europe's cheapest beach getaway

The remainder of the top ten is occupied by four European destinations – Budapest in Hungary, Crete in Greece, Paphos in Cyprus and Marmaris, Turkey – plus Cape Town, South Africa.

At £41.74, Crete had the biggest price drop (19 per cent) out of all 46 destinations, and Post Office Travel Money said the exchange rates are likely to prove ‘game changers’ when it comes to holiday choice this year.

And given the current rates UK tourists will have more cash to spend everywhere in Europe, except Turkey, compared with a year ago, according to the ‘worldwide holiday costs barometer’ study.

The cost of the eight tourist staples has fallen in two-thirds of the European countries surveyed.

Kuta, Bali, last year's No 1, was the only non-European destination to crack the top five

In Europe, the largest increase was found in Marmaris, Turkey, where a 13 per cent rise in costs didn’t prevent it from cracking the top ten.

Bali remains the best value long-haul resort, although it experienced a 21 per cent increase in its barometer basket. Costa Rica has become increasingly affordable with a 37 per cent drop in the Northern Pacific town of Tamarindo (£54.51).

The most expensive of the 46 destinations are Singapore (£149.65), Dubai (£144.50), Auckland, New Zealand (£126.70), Muscat, Oman (£120.13) and English Harbour on the Caribbean island of Antigua (£117.39).

A glass of wine, for example, costs 95p in Budapest, £1.58 in Prague and £9.35 in Dubai. 

Singapore was the most expensive of the 46 destinations, followed by Dubai, Auckland and Muscat, Oman

Post Office Travel Money ranked Costa Rica as one of its 2015 hotspots (pictured: a three-toed sloth)

The report also listed its top ten hotspots for 2015: the Caribbean islands, Costa Rica, Croatia, Dubai, Eastern Europe, Mauritius, Mexico, Greece, Iceland and Japan, with a special mention for Cuba.

Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money said: ‘Holidaymakers travelling to Europe in the coming year can look forward to better value-for-money, although they should still do their homework to ensure they don’t miss out on the best deals.

‘There is currently little difference in resort costs between the Algarve, Sunny Beach and the Costa del Sol, which are cheapest in Europe, but keep an eye on Crete and Cyprus where falls in the cost of eating out make these islands better value than ever before.’
