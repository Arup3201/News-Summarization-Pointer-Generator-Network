Margaret Thatcher once faced a diplomatic row about roses.

The incident, which saw the UK mediate between Germany and Japan over who could name a rose after her, stretches for more than 40 pages in her 1984 files.

The Tory leader was asked by the German Central Horticultural Association if it could name a flower in her honour.

Margaret Thatcher ended up at the heart of a row between Germany and Japan, who had an ongoing dispute over who should be allowed to name a rose after her. Details of the incident spans 40 pages in her 1984 files

In a speech to delegates who had travelled for a 'proper tea' at Downing Street, she remarked that she was 'deeply touched by the honour'.

Mrs Thatcher added: 'A blue rose would be too much to expect.

'(I am) Delighted however to note that according to the grower, Mr Kordes, the rose is robust, stands strong on stems, and is very long-lasting.'

But she had forgotten that in 1978 she gave permission for a Margaret Thatcher rose to be created by Japanese firm Takatori. 

The story of the German rose made international headlines and Mr Takatori wrote to the Prime Minister in complaint.

Amid threats of legal action, a young diplomat named Peter Ricketts, now Ambassador to France, concluded that, although legally the German's may have done nothing wrong, they had acted disingenuously.

After a drawn-out series of memos, it was eventually decided that the Japanese should be appeased.

Personal papers found in Thatcher's 1984 files show the correspondence sent during the 'rose' dispute

A response was sent, reading: 'The two roses are different in appearance, but if an error has been made, the prime minister very much hopes that it can be satisfactorily and easily resolved.

'We can understand your concern, and would like to assure Mr Takatori of our high regard for the masterpiece he named.'

The matter was quietly dropped but not without occupying hours of the prime minister's time.

Historian Chris Collins, from the Margaret Thatcher Foundation, said: 'It goes to show that Yes Minister really happened.

'It took up a lot of time but all they could really do was grin and bear it.

'Perhaps what's most surprising is they were utterly humourless about the whole thing.' 

She even cancelled her hairdo 

Calm and unflappable in a crisis, Thatcher showed resilience worthy of her reputation as the Iron Lady when the Brighton hotel bomb struck, the files reveal.

She was so focused on continuing as normal that she even remembered to personally write to a hairdresser after cancelling an appointment in the aftermath.

She had taken the difficult decision that the Conservative Party conference must go on in spite of the atrocity, which killed five people and injured 31 on October 12, 1984.

Among the dead were two high-profile Tories, and Mrs Thatcher herself narrowly escaped injury, but she refused to allow the tragic event to get to her.

In the aftermath of the horrific IRA bombing in Brighton on October 12, 1984, the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (above) still managed to remember to call her stylist and cancel an upcoming hair appointment

She carried on as usual the following day, attending meetings and meeting ministers but she did allow less essential appointments to slip.

The files, newly released by the Margaret Thatcher Archive Trust, show that she instructed a secretary to cancel a hair appointment with Ruffles Hair Salon in Hove, East Sussex.

But not content with this courtesy, Thatcher wrote a personal note to thank hairdresser William Thorne for his work earlier in the week.

She added: 'I was very pleased with the way you did my hair, and the fact that it lasted so well through Friday was the real test.'

According to Mrs Thatcher's appointments diary, her dressmaker, Daphne Scrimgeour, had been due to visit her at Chequers the following day but this was also cancelled.

The phrase 'lunch at Chequers' is rubbed out, suggesting she also cancelled a meal with friends.

It was not until she attended a church service on the following Monday that she was seen to publicly weep, saying on television: 'This is the day I was not meant to see.'

The letters sent from Downing Street confirm Mrs Thatcher's hair appointment for the 1984 Tory conference

Newly-released letters sent from Downing Street reveal how Thatcher wrote to her stylist, William Thorne, apologising that she had to cancel in the wake of the IRA Brighton bombing  and offering to pay him anyway

Historian Chris Collins, from the Margaret Thatcher Foundation, said: 'Her reaction was partly out of necessity and her instinct to carry on.

'I think she would have also been comforted by returning to her usual schedule.

'But also it was a natural human reaction - I'm sure many of us are familiar with the phenomenon of being in a car crash and not realising the harm that's been done until later.'

She was inundated with hundreds of letters from world leaders, political rivals and friends.

Mr Collins said: 'The number of her responses is so abundant and the touch so personal, we can see that she must have spent many hours of her time the following week handling that correspondence.'

In one of the personal letters, her private secretary John Coles said: 'We shall remember - not the bomb or the ruined building - but your courage, calm and nobility in the aftermath.

'I can imagine how much shock and sorrow you had to overcome to show those qualities so splendidly. You turned evil into inspiration.'
