They held him hostage in the Philippines for 472 days... but they were so incompetent they couldn't read, write or count.

An Australian who was held to ransom by terrorists for 15 months has told how he screamed at his bumbling captors for them to kill him after witnessing them make one of many stupid mistakes.

'Why don't you f...... kill me?' Warren Rodwell, now 56, recalled screaming at his captors midway through his imprisonment.

'You pricks don't know what you're doing!'

Mr Rodwell (right), with Dr Bob East (left) and Dr East's wife Maria (centre), is well on the way to recovering from his ordeal in the Philippines.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia before the release of a new book about his experience at the hands of Abu Sayyaf, an al-Qaeda linked militant group, Mr Rodwell shed new light on the disastrous incompetence of the mostly young guards who kept him prisoner.

In that instance, one of his captors had sat on his hammock, sending it crashing to the ground. But the terrorist organisation's problems ran far deeper than that, Mr Rodwell said.

'They were not only illiterate, they were innumerate.'

'They thought one million pesos equaled one million dollars, so let's double it (the ransom).'

He remembered one of the up to 100 guards who watched over him was particularly incompetent.

'He was completely empty in his head, he had no initiative.'

'He climbed trees and made noises like an animal.'

After a lengthy time in captivity, he said he felt there was little his captors could do to hurt him as he had nothing left.

Free at least: Warren Rodwell smiles in March 25, 2013, following his lengthy period of captivity in the Philippines as a prison of Abu Sayyaf.

Mr Rodwell lost around 30kg during his time in captivity and dropped to a body weight of 55kg.

He said when he lay down to sleep late in his captivity he could feel his ribs touching his hip bones.

Doctors told him upon his return to Australia in March 2013 that he likely would only have held out three to six months more in captivity eating small meals.

Mr Rodwell's remarks come as an independent researcher, Dr Bob East, prepares to release a new details about Mr Rodwell's kidnapping in 472 Days Captive of the Abu Sayyaf: The Surivival of Australian Warren Rodwell.

Another expert in the region, Dr Peter Sales, wrote in the book's forward that spy agencies were engaged in 'spooky' activities in the region and criticised the Australian Government's response to Mr Rodwell's kidnapping.

'Rodwell survived his ordeal, but he was poorly served by local officials and by his own government, which is capable of great dissembling and has been too willing to deal with the worst rascals in Mindanao (a province in the Phillippines).

'We are also playing clandestine games there, earning much local resentment and fuelling some nascent anti-Australian resentment.

'There are many (im)pertinent questions yet to be asked about spooky activity by intelligence agencies throughout the southern Philippines,' wrote Dr Sales.

The title of independent researcher Dr East's book, which is scheduled to be published around October by Cambridge Scholars Publishers.

Mr Rodwell is well on the path to recovery nearly 18 months after his release.

He had to have his right index finger amputated last September because of damage caused when his abductors shot him in the hand.

He is now living in Brisbane and has spent extensive time with doctors, psychologists and physiotherapists.

Mr Rodwell spent time in a wheelchair when he returned from the Phillippines because his legs were so atrophied from a lack of use.

Dr East told Daily Mail Australia Mr Rodwell had survived an ordeal which was sometimes 'harrowing'.

'The other thing I'd have to say about Warren is he's a fairly tough man... He's very shy in a lot of the ways he talks.'

'When I write about him at the book where he's completely lost his cool and screamed out great volume of obscenities to his captors - that's not his nature, you know.

'He (was) just at breaking point.'
