A  mother who suffered 13 miscarriages has put her wedding ring on sale so she can afford to adopt a little girl.

Since giving birth to her son Elias 11 years ago, Zaundia Klingbeil, 33, and her husband Enoch have suffered devastating heartache, including losing their twin sons Ezekial and Lucas at 18 weeks.

'To hold your baby on your babies in your arms, and realize you will never know what they would have looked like on their graduation,' she told Valley News Live through tears.

'You will never experience what their favorite birthday cake is.'

Emotional: Zaundia Klingbeil wipes away a tear as she talks about suffering miscarriages, including losing two twin boys. She is now hoping to adopt a little girl and is rallying to raise enough funds to afford it

Family: Zaundia, left, gave birth to her son Elias, right, 11 years ago and she and her husband Enoch, right, have been trying to have another child ever since. They are now hoping to welcome the little girl soon

She added: 'If I had another baby that I loved half as much as I love our son, all the pain would be worth it, all of it.'

The couple, from Fargo, North Dakota, might finally be getting their wish after they received a call from a couple expecting a baby girl, whom they want the Klingbeils to adopt.

But there's a cost.

The little girl, Elise, is expected to have expensive medical issues and the couple also needs to raise enough for adoption fees and travel, which they estimate will total around $8,000.

To raise enough funds, Mrs Klingbeil decided to part with her beloved wedding ring.

'We just felt like it was something God really put in our laps, and really how can you say no?' she said. 

Loved: Klingbeil, pictured right with her son, put her wedding ring, pictured top left above her husband's wedding band, up for sale but donations from the community and local businesses have been rolling in

Support: Klingbeil's family, pcitured, now hope to have an addition 'any day soon', she said

But it seems she won't have to give it up just yet, as her community has rallied around her.

Friends and strangers managed to raise more than $4,000 in donations on a gofundme page. 

A local business, with whom her husband has previously worked, has matched those funds, leaving her with $8,000.

'We have raised so much, which gives us the comfort of knowing our babies immediate needs are taken care of!' Klingbeil wrote on the gofundme page.

She added that they will still be accepting donations up until Christmas because they are not yet sure how costly Elise's medical issues will be.

The little girl is expected any day now, she said.
