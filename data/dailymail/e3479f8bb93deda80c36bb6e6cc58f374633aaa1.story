Newcastle United have unveiled an eye-catching Puma third kit - the day before thousands of banners will be displayed at St James' Park calling for manager Alan Pardew to be sacked.

With pressure mounting on the beleaguered Pardew by the day and the Magpies preparing for what is already a must-win game against Hull City on Saturday, the timing of the kit release could not be any worse.

SackPardew.com have printed 200 banners and more than 15,000 posters ready to be displayed calling for the Newcastle manager to be removed from his position by owner Mike Ashley.

Text used on the posters is also a parody of the Sports Direct logo - the company which Ashley owns and which is emblazoned across large sections of St James' Park's advertising space.

The half-blue, half-green Puma design of the new Puma kit harks back to Newcastle's opening campaigns in the Premier League.

The third kit worn between 1993 and 1995 was largely green but had navy blue pin stripes.

But the new kit is split evenly between the two colours and features a paler green than the previous design.

It will be worn for the first time when Newcastle visit Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium on Monday, September 29.

But Newcastle and Pardew face what promises to be a poisonous atmosphere at St James' on Saturday first.

The Tynesiders are winless and sit bottom of the table having taken just two points from four matches, making the Hull match a must-win match for Pardew.

A protest van emblazoned with the SackPardew.com campaign's logo will drive to some of Newcastle's most-recognisable landmarks ahead of the posters being displayed at the match.

Large banners were already held aloft emblazoned with the name of the website and with a smiling picture of Pardew during Newcastle's embarrassing 4-0 hammering at St Mary's last weekend.

There were also fans' posters with the messages 'Pardew out' and 'Pardew is a muppet' displayed in the away end on the south coast.

The Magpies' third kit will go on sale at 9am on Saturday - with shirts priced at £44.99 for adults and £31.99 for juniors - and managing director Lee Charnley said: 'We wanted to involve our supporters in the design and approval process for this kit and as such we presented a number of options to Fans Forum members.

'We are delighted to unveil this kit, chosen by those members, which I am sure our players and fans will wear with pride.'
