Back in hot water: Prince Harry during his holiday in Las Vegas, which has shocked the Royal family after he was pictured cavorting naked with women

The minders who were supposed to be protecting Prince Harry when naked pictures were taken 'acted like  amateurs who were asleep at the wheel', according to a source who was there.

The Scotland Yard protection officers are said to have been 'enjoying the party' when the girls went back to Harry's suite at Encore in Las Vegas.

Rather than asking the group to surrender their phones, the men sat back allowed the girls to take pictures while themselves joining in with the party, it is said.

As one person photographed the Prince, an officer meekly told them 'awww, come on... no photos', according to TMZ, the U.S. website that brought them from one of the group.

The source told the site that the minders 'were asleep at the wheel, enjoying the party more than protecting the Prince from himself'.

They said that even when the drunken group had drank more alcohol and stripped naked,  pictures were being taken when the protection crew were around.

'Harry's team acted like a bunch of amateurs,' the source added.

The Palace is understood to be furious that the photographs were allowed to be taken.

According to experts working closely with VIPs, handlers usually insist that guests surrender their phones to prevent embarrasing kiss and tells.

The 'breakdown in communication' was also slammed by former Royal Protection officer Ken Wharfe, who was known affectionately by the Princes as 'Uncle Ken' when he worked with Diana.

Mr Wharfe said that given Harry had been involved in 'similar' episodes, more could have been done to prevent the naked pictures being taken.

He added: 'The Commissioner will say ''hang on a minute, we haven't done anything wrong, he's alive so therefore the security is OK''. But it isn't because the people coming in are compromising  you and it's no longer an invasion of his privacy because you're inviting unknown people into your room.'

Mr Wharfe, who was one of Diana's most trusted confidantes, called for changes to the Princes security to prevent unknown guests visiting him with phones.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman refused to comment on the allegations. They told the Mail Online that they do not discuss matters of Royal Protection.

Prince Harry arrived home yesterday to face the firestorm over the photographs of him cavorting naked with women, which have now been published on dozens of web sites.

The Queen and senior members of the Royal Family were shocked by publication of the pictures taken in a Las Vegas hotel suite. They were sold to TMZ yesterday and within minutes were being viewed by internet users around the world.

But farcically British websites, newspapers and television stations were prevented from reproducing them after Prince Charles instructed lawyers to threaten legal action for infringing Prince Harry’s ‘privacy’.

The grainy shots, taken on a fellow reveller’s mobile phone, show the Queen’s grandson stark naked – apart from a distinctive thong necklace and his Rolex watch – playing a game of ‘naked billiards’ in his high rollers’ suite at the five-star Wynn Hotel.

Scandal: Prince Harry during a pool party on his Las Vegas holiday. Other images of him naked were sold to a US website yesterday and within minutes were being viewed by internet users around the world

A quick search on the the internet allows people to see the pictures that are 'banned' in the UK

An identical search on Google images for 'Prince Harry naked pictures' reveals dozens more shots of the cavorting Prince

The photos were first published by US site TMZ. But they are now being run on dozens of websites, including:

   In one picture the prince can be seen 
cupping his hands around his groin in a fruitless attempt to preserve 
his modesty as an apparently naked dark-haired girl hides behind him.

He can then be seen hugging what appears to be the same woman by the side of the pool table as other partygoers look on.

Remarkably,
 far from showing any public contrition over the scandal the playboy 
prince was said by friends to feel ‘fairly bullish’.

‘He’s not eating an awful lot of humble pie as I understand,’ said one.

Should British newspapers and websites publish the nude pictures of Prince Harry in Las Vegas?

Another
 royal source dismissed the pictures as Harry ‘simply letting off 
steam’, adding: ‘He’s a very exuberant character and he was on a 
completely private holiday.’

Although the offending photographs were 
circulating freely on the internet all day as well as being published on
 the front pages of newspapers in countries including Ireland, Charles’s
 lawyers, Harbottle and Lewis, went to the Press Complaints Commission 
to prevent British newspapers from doing the same.

A spokesman for the prince insisted that 
they were taken on ‘an entirely private occasion’ and argued that Harry 
had a ‘reasonable expectation of privacy’ in his own hotel suite.

He also flatly rejected suggestions by the media that it would be in the public interest to use the pictures given that Harry is now travelling the globe representing both his grandmother, the Queen, and the nation as a senior working member of the Royal Family.

St James’s Palace even went so far as to suggest it would be ‘prurient’ for the British media to use them although it admitted it was powerless to prevent US websites from publishing the shots.

But St James’s Palace stance on the 
issue has lead to some commentators to raise questions about the 
influence of the Leveson inquiry.

Royal correspondent Robert Jobson, writing for CNN, said: 'Surely the British paying public has a right to know what their royal family is up to.

'But post-Leveson no editor seemed, initially at least, is prepared to risk the backlash.

'Amid
 all the media navel-gazing there seems to be a genuine fear that the 
press feels it is no longer drinking in "The Last Chance Saloon" but 
time has already been called.'

What happens in Vegas... doesn't stay in Vegas: The party-loving royal was enjoying himself - but it is unclear as to what sort of reaction he will face on his return home

Surrounded by new-found friends, the Prince did not have a care in the world - until everyone else saw the photos

The existence of the photographs – and
 the palace’s attempts to ban the media from using them – were quickly 
picked up by all the major broadcasters including the BBC, ITV and Sky 
who featured prominent reports on the issue in their major news 
bulletins, highlighting they were also prevented from reproducing them.

Bare-chested and wearing sunglasses, he blends in perfectly with the rest of the pool party revellers.

But the man sharing Prince Harry’s Jacuzzi in Las Vegas is in fact his taxpayer-funded police protection officer.

The unnamed Scotland Yard officer, on the left in the picture above, was one of at least three personal protection officers tasked with guarding the 27-year-old prince round the clock on his US holiday.

His police detail is estimated to cost the taxpayer £2million a year, and the photos are bound to raise questions at the highest level.

Dai Davies, the former head of Scotland Yard’s Royalty Protection Squad, said it was a ‘very tricky situation’ for the officers.

But he added: ‘I’m not exactly sure how [protecting Harry] can be done when you are wearing your swimming trunks in a Jacuzzi. Where is his gun for a start? And if he is not deemed to need one then is there any justification for him being there?’

Harry
 landed at Heathrow from Los Angeles shortly before 4pm yesterday. 
Despite reports that he would be dragged up to Scotland to explain 
himself in person to both his grandmother and father who are holidaying 
on their private estates, royal sources said they were not aware of 
this.

But the prince – and his Scotland Yard bodyguards – will be expected to explain just how he ended up partying naked with a group of ‘hot chicks’ he had apparently just met in his £5,100-a-night suite in the five-star Wynn Hotel and, more importantly, why they were allowed to film it.

The Queen’s former press secretary, Dickie Arbiter, said Harry was a ‘loose cannon and shouldn’t be left alone’.

Labour MP Stephen Pound added: ‘This is a first for the royals and a new low for the royal protection team.’

The
 latest incident to involve the party-loving prince, who turns 28 next 
month, has come as a huge disappointment to his palace advisers, who had
 been buoyed by Harry’s growing maturity.

His decision to retrain as a pilot, 
proving himself good enough to fly the military’s most high-profile 
attack helicopter, the Apache, with a view to returning to the front 
line in Afghanistan had apparently helped him turn a corner.

Earlier
 this year he undertook his first official foreign tour on behalf of the
 Queen and charmed statesmen and members of the public alike from the 
Bahamas to Brazil with his puppyish enthusiasm.

The trip was deemed such a success that there was already talk of another next year if his military commitments permitted.

As a result the prince was also asked to become an official Olympic Team GB Ambassador.

His
 most significant job came less than two weeks ago when he was asked to 
stand in for the Queen at the closing ceremony of the London Games in 
front of an audience of billions.

Moment of realisation? Harry arrived in Los Angeles just an hour after the photos surfaced on the internet and spent much of his time on his mobile phone suggesting that the news had been broken to him

Harry and Co left Vegas on Tuesday, arriving in Los Angeles just an hour after his naked photos hit the internet.

In blue shirt, cream panama hat and sunglasses, the prince looked apprehensive as he waited in a car park outside a restaurant in trendy Venice Beach.

While his friends ate inside, he spent much of his time on his mobile phone suggesting that the news had been broken to him.
