Geri Halliwell today described herself as 'spineless' and 'weak' for deleting a tweet that paid tribute to Baroness Thatcher when she died.

The Spice Girl angered fans on Monday by writing: 'Thinking of our 1st Lady of girl power, Margaret Thatcher, a grocer’s daughter who taught me anything is possible…x’.

A backlash caused her to delete the message and apologise, but today Ms Halliwell said she regretted it and should have shown the courage the Iron Lady had in her political career.

U-turn: Geri Halliwell tweeted her sadness at the death of Baroness Thatcher but swiftly deleted the post on Monday - but today she said she was 'spineless' to do it and still admired the Iron Lady

Blog: Geri wrote today on her website under the title 'weak under fire', and said that she had thought about what she did for three days and felt compelled to put it right

'I realise that I do admire a woman, whether she is right or wrong, regardless of her opinions. She had the courage to stand by her 
convictions. Not like me. I look at my behaviour, which exposed how weak I
 was under fire, not like Margaret Thatcher. Rest in peace,' she wrote on her blog.

'I was so afraid of upsetting people, and not being liked for saying something that was not to everyone’s taste.

'When I’m scared, my natural state is to hide and run for cover'.

Geri was attacked online this week, with one
 disgruntled Twitter user writing: 'So Geri Halliwell tweeted about the 
'first Lady of girl power' and then deleted it after getting some stick?
 Girl power indeed. #thatcher.'

The 40-year-old then deleted the tweet, and wrote: 'I'm sorry if I offended u. X'

Changing her mind: The Spice Girl tweeted that Thatcher was the 1st Lady of girl power, but removed the tweet after receiving criticism

Apology: Geri was quick to delete the post and apologised to fans

Explaining her decision she wrote today: 'I was so confused and overwhelmed by some of the feedback I received that I took my tweet down and for that I was called spineless.

'I realised the best thing to do was to shut up and really get honest with myself. What I hated the most was that I took a tweet down. I had wavered and was full of self-doubt.

'I suddenly thought given the adverse reaction, did I even really know 
enough about Margaret Thatcher?  Was I just trying to be relevant? She 
had obviously upset a lot of people.'

Geri has involved herself in politics ever since her rise to fame.

Before Tony Blair swept to power in 1997 she said: 'I saw a lot of what Mrs Thatcher did. She was definitely the original Spice Girl rising from the greengrocer's daughter to Prime Minister.'

A year earlier she said Blair was 'not a safe pair of hands for the economy'.

DJ and presenter Lauren Laverne later called her 'Tory scum', but the Spice Girl maintained that Thatcher was an inspiration.

But in 2001 she switched to New Labour and even appeared in one of the party's election broadcasts.

Weak under fire

(please forgive grammar & spelling!)

When I’m scared, my natural state is to hide and run for cover.

I was 7 years old when my father told me about the greengrocer’s daughter who had become the first female Prime Minister in our history. I was enchanted by this… my father who was always hiding behind the broadsheets spoke about her my whole childhood.

Fast forward to 1996… It was widely covered in the media, when I casually mentioned that I admired Margaret Thatcher in an interview for a political magazine.

Monday 8th April 2013 – Margaret Thatcher had died… I felt compelled to tweet my thoughts for a female leader, in a world governed by men.

I was so confused and overwhelmed by some of the feedback I received that I took my tweet down and for that I was called spineless.

I questioned myself? Did I really mean what I said? Can I stand tall? Do I even know what I was talking about?

I realised the best thing to do was to shut up and really get honest with myself. What I hated the most was that I took a tweet down. I had wavered and was full of self-doubt.

I so I asked myself over the last 3 days – why I did I do it? Why did I take that tweet down?

These are my conclusions…

I. I was so afraid of upsetting people, and not being liked for saying something that was not to everyone’s taste.

2. Also, I suddenly thought given the adverse reaction, did I even really know enough about Margaret Thatcher?  Was I just trying to be relevant? She had obviously upset a lot of people.

3. But now I realise that I do admire a woman, whether she is right or wrong, regardless of her opinions. She had the courage to stand by her convictions. Not like me. I look at my behavior, which exposed how weak I was under fire, not like Margaret Thatcher. Rest in peace.

Much love Geri xxx
