The student skydiver who suffered a seizure while free-falling at 2743 m (9000 ft) was an epilepsy sufferer who believed he had his condition under control. 

Incredible footage shows the terrifying moment Christopher Jones, 22, had an epileptic seizure while free-falling at 2743 m (9000 ft).

Mr Jones,  from Perth, suffered the near-death experience while trying to do a left-hand turn in mid-air and was saved by his fast-acting sky diving instructor who opened his parachute with seconds to spare.

Skydiving instructor Sheldon McFarlane, 40, said Mr Jones had epilepsy but hadn't had a seizure in four years and had been given the all-clear by his doctor.

'He had all the documentation and had been to his doctor, he had been seizure-free for a number of years and believed he had it under control,' Mr McFarlane told Daily Mail Australia.

Mr Jones said he dreamed of being a pilot but was unable to because of his condition, so he had decided to try skydiving instead.

'I'd been seizure-free for four years,' he told ABC.

'I've always wanted to have the feeling of flight, so I just thought, considering I can't fly a plane due to my condition, I thought I'd give it a go.'

Footage filmed from Mr McFarlane's helmet camera shows  Mr Jones quickly lose consciousness after jumping out of a plane over Pinjarra, south of Perth, last November.

Mr McFarlane said he could see Mr Jones was spinning out of control but he did not realise he was having a seizure.

'He rolled over and was unconscious on his back and he started spinning,' he said.

'I thought he was having sensory overload or something, I wasn't quite sure what was going on.

'He was in the foetal positon.' 

Mr McFarlane said it was a tricky manoeuvre to get to Mr Jones and open his parachute, but said he was well-trained and had more than 20 years' experience as an instructor.

'I thought it would be better to go down and make him stop,' he said.

'I just wanted to make sure he was safe and his parachute was open sooner rather than later.'

Mr Jones regained consciousness at 914 m (3000 ft) and managed to land safely on the ground.

He was completing stage five of his Accelerated Free Fall program with an instructor at the WA Skydiving Academy in Jandakot, southern Perth.

Mr McFarlane only found out Mr Jones had suffered a seizure once the ground, after Mr Jones entered the hangar and told him.
