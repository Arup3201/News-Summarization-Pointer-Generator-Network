Behind bars: Eddie Ray Routh has been charged with two counts of murder and is being held on $3million bail. He went to his sister's house after the murders and allegedly confessed

The sister of the Iraq War veteran accused of killing a former Navy Seal sniper and his friend at a Texas shooting range made a terrified call to 911 after her brother allegedly 'confessed' to the crimes.

'My brother just came by here ... he's now left but he told me he committed murder and I am terrified for my life because I don't know if he'll come back here,' said Laura Blevins of her sibling, Eddie Ray Routh.

'He said he killed two guys. They went out to a shooting range,' Blevins added, according to the five-minute call which was obtained by the Dallas Morning News.

Blevins can be heard telling someone to 'get your shoes on, let's go' as she and her family flee the home.

The dispatcher instructs them to head to the police station where they'll be safe.

Blevins then had to hand the phone to her husband because she was too emotional to speak clearly.

The husband tells the dispatcher what kind of car Routh was driving and how he had recently left a mental hospital after being diagnosed with PTSD.

Routh had told his sister he had 'traded his soul for a new truck', it has been claimed.

Routh, 25, is charged with the murders of Chris Kyle, author 
of the best-selling book 'American Sniper,' and his friend Chad 
Littlefield at a shooting range in Glen Rose. He is on suicide 
watch in the Erath County Jail, where he's being held on $3 million 
bond.

Routh had been taken to a mental hospital 
twice in the past five months and told authorities that he was suffering
from post-traumatic stress disorder, police records show.

According to an Erath County arrest warrantÂ  affidavit obtained by WFAA-TV after the shootings Routh told his sister and brother-in-law that he 'traded his soul 
for a new truck.'

Police 
said that Routh was driving the truck of victim and ex-Navy SEAL Chris 
Kyle at the time of arrest.

Routh, a member of the Marines Corps Reserve, was first taken to a mental hospital on Sept. 2 after he threatened to kill his family and himself, according to police records in Lancaster, where Routh lives.

Victim: Chris Kyle, a sniper with the most confirmed kills in U.S. history, was at the range with Routh and a friend because they were trying to help him with his PTSD

Authorities found Routh walking 
nearby with no shirt and no shoes, and smelling of alcohol. Routh told 
authorities he was a Marine veteran who was suffering from 
post-traumatic stress disorder.

'Eddie stated he was hurting and that his family does not understand what he has been through," the report said.

Routh's mother told police that her son had been drinking and became upset when his father said he was going to sell his gun.

She said Routh began arguing with them and said he was going to "blow his brains out.' Police took Routh to Green Oaks Hospital for psychiatric care.

Dallas police records show Routh was 
taken back to the same mental hospital in mid-January after a woman 
called police and said she feared for Routh's safety.

Scene: The shooting took place at Rough Creek Lodge in Glen Rose, Texas on Saturday afternoon. The group arrived at the range at around 3.15pm and the two mens' bodies were found just after 5pm

Green Oaks will not release patient 
information, citing privacy laws. Most people brought by police to the 
hospital are required to stay at least 48 hours.

In May, Routh's mother reported a 
burglary that included nine pill bottles and her son was involved, 
according to a Lancaster police report. No other details were available.

Authorities say Routh, Kyle and 
Littlefield arrived at the sprawling Rough Creek Lodge at about 3:15 
p.m. Saturday, and a hunting guide called 911 about two hours later 
after discovering the bodies. Kyle and Littlefield were shot multiple 
times, and numerous guns were at the scene, according to the affidavit.

Jailers used a stun gun on Routh on 
Sunday night after he appeared ready to assault them when they entered 
his cell after he refused to return his food tray, the sheriff said. 
Then they put Routh in a chair that restrains his arms and legs in his 
solitary confinement cell, Bryant said.

Bryant said Routh has an attorney but hasn't met with him at the jail in Stephenville, about 75 miles southwest of Fort Worth.

Author: While in Iraq, Kyle survived being shot twice 
and he lived through six separate IED explosions as his unit, Charlie 
company of SEAL Team Three, saw significant combat. He wrote about his experiences in the best-selling book American Sniper

Kyle recorded more than 150 sniper kills - the most in U.S. military history - between 1999 and 2009

Attempts by The Associated Press to reach Routh's mother and sister were unsuccessful Monday.

Sundae Hughes, an aunt of Routh's, 
said she watched him grow up but hasn't seen him since his high school 
graduation in 2006. Hughes was in disbelief that her nephew could be 
involved in such an incident.

'He has a kind heart (and was) someone willing to jump in and help, no matter what it was,' she said.

Routh joined the Marines in 2006 and 
rose to the rank of corporal in 2010. His military specialty was 
small-arms technician, commonly known as an armorer.

He had been stationed at Camp Lejeune, N.C., and served in Iraq from 2007-08 and in the Haiti disaster relief mission in 2010.

Caught: Police searched for Routh for hours following the shooting on Saturday afternoon but he was found after his sister called him in, as he fled to her house in Kyle's pick up truck and proceeded to confess to the killings

Criticism: Former Texas congressman Ron Paul posted a controversial message about the shooting

He is now in the individual ready 
reserve. He could be called to duty, but it's uncommon unless he 
volunteers, 1st Lt. Dominic Pitrone of the Marine Forces Services public
affairs office said.

Travis Cox, director of FITCO Cares 
-- the nonprofit that Kyle set up to give in-home fitness equipment to 
physically and emotionally wounded veterans -- said he believes that 
Kyle and Littlefield were helping Routh work through PTSD.

Cox didn't know how Routh and Kyle knew each other. He said the shooting range event was not a FITCO session.

Kyle, 38, left the Navy in 2009 after
four tours of duty in Iraq, where he earned a reputation as one of the 
military's most lethal snipers.

'American Sniper' was the No. 3 seller of paperbacks and hardcovers on Amazon as of Monday, and the hardcover was out of stock.

His publisher said Kyle was working on "American Gun: A History of the U.S. in Ten Firearms" with co-author William Doyle.

Littlefield, 35, was Kyle's friend, neighbor and "workout buddy," and also volunteered his time to work with veterans, Cox said.

'My brother just came by here. He's left now but he told me he committed a murder and I am terrified for my life because I don't know if he'll come back here.'

'Now listen, I don't know if hes being honest with me.'

'I'm really scared. He said he killed two guys, they went out to a shooting range. Like he's crazy, he's f-----g psychotic. I'm sorry for my language.'

'I don't know if he's on drugs or not but I know he's been, here talk, my husband will talk to you because I'm so nervous.'
