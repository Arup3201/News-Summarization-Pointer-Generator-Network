Convictions: Jan Morales has a 40-year history of appalling crimes yet was allowed to work as a paramedic

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has ordered an investigation into how the owner of a fleet of ambulances was allowed to drive vehicles and work as a paramedic – despite criminal convictions for kidnapping, assault and child pornography.

The move follows serious concerns raised by a senior judge after The Mail on Sunday reported how health regulator the Care Quality Commission (CQC) granted the firm a licence.

Jan Morales, co-owner of Staffordshire-based International Medical Assistance, has a string of convictions going back more than 40 years.

Despite his history he had access to keys to the front doors of patients who might have to call for help.

Now, after blasting the inadequate checks done on Morales by the CQC, the Care Standards Tribunal has referred the case to Mr Hunt.

Earlier this year The Mail on Sunday reported that CQC granted the registration in full knowledge of Morales’s 21 child pornography  offences, for which he was jailed in 2005.

But it took the CQC until this month to stop him from working with patients, even though he was on the sex offenders’ register.

The MoS has been told by senior sources in the private ambulance industry that dozens of companies have never been properly inspected.

Even before Morales’s firm was approved, concerns had been raised.

‘It is clear at the time of the assessment for registration, Staffordshire Police had disclosed that Mr Morales had been convicted of offences relating to child pornography,’ said tribunal judge Gillian Irving QC.

‘We found it astonishing as the facts of this case materialised that a man with the forensic history of  Mr Morales was able to hold the position of director in a company such as this.

'It was difficult to  imagine anyone less suitable or appropriate.’

Inquiry: Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has ordered an investigation into how Morales was allowed to drive emergency vehicles

Observing that users of private ambulance services are ‘some of the most vulnerable in our society’, the judge worried that there is no requirement for staff to be checked through the Criminal Records Bureau.

A spokesman for the CQC said: ‘We acknowledge that we should not have registered the private ambulance provider. CQC have written to the Secretary of State to make him aware of this case.’

The Department of Health said: ‘This is clearly wrong and never should have happened. We are currently looking into tightening safeguarding measures.’

Concerns: Andy Burnham

NHS bosses are increasingly using ‘poorly trained’ private ambulance crews for the most serious 999 calls as the crisis in emergency care worsens.

In London the bill for using private ambulances has gone up ten-fold in two years to more than £4 million due to cuts and an increase in calls.

Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘Whistleblowers have contacted Labour with concerns that even the most serious 999 calls are being handled by private ambulances without properly trained staff.’

Gary Palmer, from the GMB union, which represents paramedics, said: ‘The training of the private crews can often be less than for an NHS ambulance.’

A spokesman for Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ‘The NHS is seeing an extra one million more patients each year in A&E and despite the additional workload is coping well.’
