Lukas Podolski is on his way to Milan to tie up a loan deal which would see him join up with Roberto Mancini's Inter until the end of the season.

The 29-year-old was likely to feature in Arsenal's FA Cup tie against Hull on Saturday but looks to be ready to sign a deal costing Inter £1.5million for a loan deal until the end of the season.

The unsettled Germany forward has one year on his Arsenal contract at the end of this season and may not return if his loan is successful.

Podolski missed Arsenal's 2-0 defeat to Southampton on New Year's Day due to injury, and Arsene Wenger revealed that the club had received an improved bid from the Italian giants - he called Inter's previous offer 'farcical'. 

He has featured in thirteen of the Gunners' games this season but only managed to find the net three times, all of which came in the Champions League.

Podolski has flourished in Europe this season but has been given limited opportunities in the Premier League.  

Podolski would be joining up with a struggling Inter side who currently sit eleventh in Serie A and have only managed one win in the league since the beginning of November.

The 29-year-old has spent much of the season on the bench, making just 13 appearances for Arsenal 

Inter manager Roberto Mancini will be hoping Podoloski can help his side climb up the Serie A table
