‘Out, damned spot! out, I say!’, cried Lady Macbeth after she had murdered King Duncan.

400-years later and Lady Macbeths’ torment are still echoed by huge numbers of people who feel dirty even when they are physically clean.  

Often this is a result of physical and emotional trauma, according to Stanley Rachman, a professor at the Institute of Psychiatry in London.

Compulsive washing can occur in people who have suffered a physical or emotional trauma, such as betrayal

He claims this ‘mental contamination’ is caused by feelings such as degradation, humiliation, hurtful criticism and betrayal.

In a recent editorial in the journal Nature, he says: ‘The source of the pollution is not an external contaminant such as blood or dirt, but human interaction.

‘The affected person develops strong feelings of contamination that are evoked by direct contact with the violator or indirect contacts such as memories, images or reminders of the violation.’

Often, people are unwilling or unable to speak the name of the violator.

Professor Rachman led a study of 50 young women who had been sexually assaulted. Many of the women reported feeling ‘polluted’ after the assault and engaged in compulsive washing.

A substantial minority continued to feel unclean for months afterward.

‘This discovery has large and immediate implications for clinical treatment,’ said Professor Rachman.

For instance a common technique to treat compulsive washing is something called exposure and response prevention, where patients are exposed to unclean objects.

The therapy aims to untangle the psychological 'conditioned' association between fear and the source of the fear.

The idea that it is possible to wash away our sins is deep rooted in many cultures and religions, including Christianity. For instance, Pontius Pilate washed his hands after condemning Jesus to death

Previous research has found that the areas of the brain that deal with physical cleanliness likely overlap with those that process psychological purity.

For instance, a number of research teams have been able to establish a clear link between not only washing hands to clear trauma, but also by those who want to absolve guilt.

The idea that it is possible to wash away our sins is deep rooted in many cultures and religions, including Christianity.

Water is a cornerstone of baptism ceremonies and, in the Bible, Pontius Pilate washed his hands after condemning Jesus to death.

‘If the effects of the therapy are confirmed, it would have a major impact,’ writes Professor Rachman.

‘We would at last be able to treat the many patients who are currently, like Lady Macbeth, beyond our help.’
