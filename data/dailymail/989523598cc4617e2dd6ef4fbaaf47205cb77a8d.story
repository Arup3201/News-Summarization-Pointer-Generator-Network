The kidnapped father of Chelsea footballer John Obi Mikel has been rescued from his captors in Nigeria after being missing for 10 days.

Michael Obi, who runs a transport company, had not been seen or heard from since he failed to return home from work in Jos, the capital of Plateau State in central Nigeria, on August 12.

But Nigerian police said detectives traced the kidnappers to Kano, a sprawling city in northern Nigeria around 180 miles away from where he was snatched, and arrested the people responsible.

In the pictures released by Nigerian police Michael looks disheveled, tired and drawn, with his pink shirt torn at the lapel, but he is now safe.

He took part in a hastily-arranged news conference on Monday night at a police station in Kano, where six of his suspected kidnappers were paraded.

'I was taken right deep into the bush, in an isolated area in Jos,' said Michael in a brief statement to journalists.

'I started begging them, yet they beat me mercilessly, kicking me with their boot. They are five of them and they were dressed in military uniforms.

'They pushed me into a vehicle painted in military (colors) and began to drive very fast. I never knew a vehicle can fly like that.'

Police said they had launched an investigation to see if the accused were soldiers, though authorities believe the kidnappers used military-style camouflage fatigues to abduct Michael and remain unchallenged in a country still wary of the military after a string of dictatorships.

Kano state police commissioner Ibrahim Idris identified the kidnappers as five men, including a former police officer, and a woman.

The accused did not immediately have a lawyer and remained largely silent as police showed them to journalists.

London-based Sport Entertainment and Media Group, the management company for John Obi Mikel, welcomed his father's release.

Mikel's management company SEM released a statement this evening confirming that the Nigerian international's father had been released.

'Earlier today Michael Obi called his family to advise them that he had been released by his abductors,' the statement read.

'(We) have waited until now to release this information, to ensure that Michael was safe.

'John Obi Mikel would like to thank everyone in Nigeria, his family & friends, Chelsea FC & their fans & his agents for their total support during this terrible time.'

The statement does not reveal whether a ransom was paid.

Michael Obi is reported to have told the BBC shortly after his release: 'I am very stressed.'

Mikel continued to play for Chelsea during his father's disappearance, appearing in the Blues' Barclays Premier League opener at Stoke before their home 2-1 win over West Brom on Saturday.

Chelsea released a statement tonight offering their support for Mikel's family.

'All at Chelsea Football Club are delighted that John Mikel Obi's father, Michael, has been found safe in Nigeria,' the statement read.

Michael Obi was kidnapped on August 12 while on his way home from work in the central Nigerian city of Jos.

Nigeria, an oil-rich country of 150 million people, is almost evenly split between Muslims in the north and the predominantly Christian south.

Plateau state, in Nigeria's fertile central belt, has seen thousands die in recent years in religious and ethnic violence rooted largely in political and economic issues.

Mikel's family, from the Igbo tribe, is in the minority in the Plateau State. However, the footballer said the kidnapping shocked him because his family never had any problems there before.

Kidnappings in Plateau state are a rarity when compared to Nigeria's oil-producing southern delta, where militants and criminal gangs often kidnap foreigners for ransom.

Middle class Nigerian families also increasingly find themselves targeted in the country's East as well.

It isn't the first time a football player's family has been targeted in Nigeria.

In 2008, gunmen abducted the younger brother of Everton defender Joseph Yobo as he left a nightclub in Port Harcourt, the delta's largest city. The brother was released unharmed about two weeks later, though it was unclear if a ransom had been paid.

Most kidnap victims find themselves released only after their loved ones pay ransom.

A Forbes magazine survey in June listed Mikel as the seventh highest-paid African player in Europe. The magazine listed Mikel's salary as around Â£3.5million a year.
