Beaten up: Castro, a father of seven who was known to have had dementia, got into a struggle over a bicycle with a man outside the fast food restaurant, officials said

A father of seven with dementia who wandered away from his home was beaten to death in an argument with a stranger over a bicycle.

Detectives are looking for help in catching the man who fatally beat Navy veteran Santos Castro, described by his grandson as 'the most kind and loving man in the world.' 

Castro, 76, a father of seven  walked from home to a Carl's Jr. in East Los Angeles when he got into a struggle over a bicycle with a man outside the fast food restaurant.

The assailant punched Castro multiple times in the head, forcing him to fall to the sidewalk, police said. Castro died at a hospital of blunt force trauma hours after the attack.

The suspect was caught on security video taken inside the burger joint prior to the beating.

Castro, known for performing magic tricks for his seven children and many grandchildren, and for his love of singing, is now etched on T-shirts and reward posters. His family is pleading for the public to help bring justice. 

Sheriff's officials said the suspect punched Castro several times in the head, knocking him to the sidewalk. Castro was taken to Los Angeles County+USC Medical Center, where he died.

'I miss my husband very, very much. I miss him,' Leandra Castro said. 'I don't know why they did that to him. I can't be without him. He was such a good guy. He was so good.'

Santos is also survived by three sisters, four brothers and seven children.

'He was the most kind and loving man in the whole world,' said one of Castro's granddaughters. 'My grandpa was an elderly man who meant no harm to anyone.' 

Loved: I miss my husband very, very much. I miss him. I don't know why they did that to him. I can't be without him,' widow Leandra Castro said. 'He was so good.'
