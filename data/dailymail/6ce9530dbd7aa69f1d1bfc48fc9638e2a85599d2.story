With temperatures plunging towards zero, most of us are reaching for our thick wool coats, cashmere jumpers and cosy hats whether inside or out.

So spare a thought for the group of models seen parading down London's Oxford Street clad only in lingerie this morning.

But there was one silver lining in their chilly cloud: the photo shoot, which brought admiring glances from more than one passing man, was to help unveil the newly relaunched Debenhams flagship store.

The models, who came in a variety of shapes and sizes, lined up alongside lingerie designer Aliza Reger on the chilly pavement.

Sporting designs by Reger by Janet Reger, Gorgeous, Wonderbra, Triumph, Princesse TamTam, Curvy Kate and Elomi, their appearance marked the official reopening of the Oxford Street store following a £25 million refurbishment.

The refurb is the largest ever single redevelopment that Oxford Street has seen and was completed just in time for Debenhams' 200th anniversary on Christmas day.

The extensive works have spanned 12 months, creating 400 new jobs and setting the standard for the retailer’s continuing expansion programme both at home and abroad.

'We set out to create a true flagship store to compete with the very best Europe has to offer on the most famous shopping street in the world,' explained CEO Michael Sharp.

'That’s exactly what we have done. I am very proud of the result.'

The new-look store has a floor entirely dedicated to lingerie, much of which will be modelled on Debenhams' newly introduced plus size mannequins.

Other features include a bistro and a prosecco bar, where, to celebrate the official opening of the new look store, Debenhams will be hosting a lingerie evening on the 12th to officially launch the floor to customers.

Customers will be treated to complimentary prosecco, bra fits, lingerie advice, competitions and discounts from big name brands.
