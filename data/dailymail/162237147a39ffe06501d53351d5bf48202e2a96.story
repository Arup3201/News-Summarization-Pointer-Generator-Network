In a network first, ABC has selected two new weekend anchors who are both Latino for the flagship evening program World News Tonight.

Cecilia Vega will work on Saturdays and Tom Llamas will take Sundays, ABC announced.  

Both reporters have been filling in on the broadcasts since previous weekend anchor David Muir began doing the weekday shows last September after Diane Sawyer stepped down. 

ABC has selected Cecilia Vega and Tom Llamas to be the two new weekend anchors for the network's flagship evening program World News Tonight. Vega will work on Saturdays and Llamas will take Sundays 

Vega has worked for ABC since 2011 at the network's San Francisco Bay Area affiliate. 

In an office memo ABC News President James Goldston noted Vega was an Emmy-winning journalist who has covered the Olympics, Occupy Wall Street protests and Barack Obama's presidential election. 

Vega will be moving to New York from California for the position. 

Llamas, also an Emmy-winner, has only been with ABC for five months. 

He has reported on the Ebola outbreak, the controversy surrounding the shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice by police and the massacre of three Muslim students in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. 

Goldston said both anchors would also be joining ABC News' political team for the 2016 presidential election, which is being lead by the network's chief anchor George Stephanopoulos. 

Elizabeth Vargas, who is half-Puerto Rican, anchored the program's weekday shows with Bob Woodruff from January to May 2006.  

Llamas has been with ABC for five months and has reported on the Ebola outbreak and Chapel Hill massacre. Llamas has been with the network's San Francisco affiliate since 2011 and has covered everything from the Olympics to Barack Obama's presidential election
