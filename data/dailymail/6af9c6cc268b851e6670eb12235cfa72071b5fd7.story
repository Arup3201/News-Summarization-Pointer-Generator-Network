A third of strip club  dancers are students who are increasingly likely to come  from middle-class families, a study shows.

They have become a ‘core supply group into the sex industries’, with clubs even attempting to recruit pretty girls during university freshers’ week events.

Researchers say that the ‘normalisation of porn’ and the rise of ‘raunch culture’ have led to sexual services  such as stripping increasingly being viewed as respectable, particularly among the middle-classes.

Extra-curricular: Almost a third of strip club workers are now students, according to a recent study. Some are middle-class and see the cash-in-hand work as a 'bonus' while others need to make ends meet

Some students are secretly joining the industry because they are excited about experiencing a ‘forbidden occupation’ and enjoy the party atmosphere of the clubs.

They consider earning cash in hand ‘a bonus’, while other less affluent students are working in strip clubs to help pay for their education.

The study was carried out by Leeds University academics Dr Teela Sanders, a reader in sociology, and Dr Kate Hardy, a lecturer in work and employment relations. They interviewed almost 200 dancers from pubs and strip clubs across the UK and found that 29.4 per cent were students.

Dr Sanders told the Times Higher Education magazine: ‘Many of these dancers are from middle-class backgrounds – they are not coming from families where money is a big issue.’

One student told the study: 'It's just like party night! I prefer to go to work than go out on a weekend'

A number of the students saw themselves as dancers, not sex workers, because ‘selling striptease had become more palatable and socially acceptable’. Dr Sanders added: ‘They enjoyed dressing up to go out and many say it wasn’t too different to heading out on a night out.’

Their study, published by the British Journal of Sociology of Education, claimed that there was a ‘growing acceptance and normalisation of sex work among undergraduate students in the United Kingdom’.

It said: ‘Student dancers often saw the financial aspect as only one of the advantages to the work; being in a party atmosphere and part of the night-time economy was often a significant attraction. The decisions to enter the industry are complex, not only driven by financial incentive but also by the desire to engage in a “forbidden” occupation.

‘Students often started dancing with friends as a joint venture, drawn in by the initial excitement of engaging in a transgressive world, and the prospect of earning cash in hand on the night was considered a bonus.’

However, the study found conflicting attitudes between student strippers and other girls. It said: ‘There was a definite tension between the “old school” dancers who were there to earn good money and not socialise, and the new, inexperienced younger women who had a range of motives for entering stripping.’

A 34-year-old dancer called Faith told researchers: ‘There’s kind of the student group that maybe might kind of work from time to time. They see it as an extra boost of cash but (they are) not necessarily amazing at the job ‘cos they don’t do it enough to really know how to work.’

One 23-year-old student, identified as Lana, told researchers: ‘It’s like – just like party night! I prefer to go to work than go out on a weekend really.’ Another student, Anna, 27, said the work was ‘sociable’ and she liked to ‘catch up with everyone’.

Many of the students had begun working in clubs after visiting as a customer or starting off doing bar work in the venue. A club manager in a northern city said he put flyers out at freshers’ week events, inviting female students to audition.

He claimed that September – when students return to campuses – is a ‘peak time for requests from experienced and inexperienced dancers alike to work a shift’.
