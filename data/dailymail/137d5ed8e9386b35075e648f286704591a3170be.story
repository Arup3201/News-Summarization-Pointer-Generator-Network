Famous face: William Middleton who now has an embarrassing nickname - Bucket Heid

He hit the headlines after an embarrassing photo emerged of him with his head trapped inside a public litter bin.

And now William Middleton has a suitably mortifying nickname to match - Bucket Heid.

The 53-year-old had to be cut free by firefighters on Sunday as a bemused crowd in Aberdeen city centre looked on.

Unfortunately for Mr Middleton, someone caught his ordeal on camera and posted the image online.

Within 24 hours it had been seen by 4,000 people.

Yesterday Mr Middleton said his 
bonnet had dropped in the bin as he disposed of some litter – and he got
 trapped while trying to fish it out.

‘I couldn’t get my head out. It was 
shocking,’ he added. I was looking for my hat. I was stuck for about 20 
minutes. It was stinking. I’m now known as Bucket Heid.’

A passer-by dialled 999 and Grampian Fire & Rescue Service arrived about 5.45pm.

Firefighters managed to cut free the 
homeless man within 15 minutes, using a high-powered saw, but his 
predicament had already attracted attention.

One woman, who did not want to be 
named, said: ‘I walked around the corner and saw his walking stick on 
the ground and his bum sticking out, and said “that’s Willie”.

‘Me and my pals tried to pull him out
 but his ears were stuck. He is a well-known public figure around here 
and now he’s even more famous.’

A Scottish Ambulance Service 
spokesman said Mr Middleton was not injured but was taken to Aberdeen 
Royal Infirmary as a precaution.

He added: ‘He was released but needed to be checked over.'

Rescue: After Mr Middleton was freed, he was sat on a bench and given oxygen

Emergency help: Onlookers called 999 and Grampian Fire and Rescue workers used an electric saw to cut the top off the bin and free him just after 6pm

Treatment: Mr Middleton was taken to the Aberdeen Royal Infirmary by ambulance where he was treated for facial injuries before being released later on Sunday

Selma, a worker in the Castle Bar which overlooks the square, said: 'He couldn’t move at all - his head was really stuck in the bin tight and he was shouting for help.

'The fire brigade came pretty quick and 
took the top off the bin, but it took at least 15 minutes and the guy 
was in a bit of a panic by the sound of it.'

A local who was in the Castle Bar 
which overlooks the square, said: 'He was really screaming and shouting 
for help - but to be honest, most people just stood around laughing and 
taking pictures.'

But some who viewed the footage 
online were more sympathetic.

One blogger wrote: ‘I think anyone who 
laughs at his situation should be ashamed of themselves.’
