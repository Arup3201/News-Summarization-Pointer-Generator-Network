The girlfriend of former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez has been indicted on a perjury charge in connection with the killing of his friend, bringing the number of people facing charges in the case to five.

A grand jury indicted Shayanna Jenkins, 24, on a single count in relation to the investigation into the June 17 killing of Odin Lloyd, Bristol County District Attorney Samuel Sutter said.

It wasn't clear what led to the charge.

Lloyd, a 27-year-old semiprofessional football player from Boston, was found shot to death in an industrial park in North Attleborough, Massachusetts, near Hernandez's home, where Jenkins also lives. Lloyd had been dating Jenkins' sister.

Jenkins was not arrested and will be ordered to appear in court for an arraignment, the prosecutor's office said. She and Hernandez have a young child together.

Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder and weapons charges in Lloyd's death and is being held without bail.

His attorneys have said the state won't be able to prove its case during a jury trial and that Hernandez will be exonerated.

Victim: Footballer Odin Lloyd, 27, was found shot dead near to Hernandez's home on June 17

Prosecutors say Hernandez killed Lloyd because he was upset with him for talking to some people at a nightclub with whom he had had problems.

In addition to Hernandez and his girlfriend, three others face charges in the case. Hernandez associate Ernest Wallace has pleaded not guilty to being an accessory to murder after the fact.

Another associate of Hernandez, Carlos Ortiz, also was indicted on the same charge, Sutter said Friday.

Ortiz's attorney, John Connors, said on Friday that the indictment wasn't unexpected.

He said Ortiz will plead not guilty to the new charge and that he will make an argument for bail but had no further comment.

A hearing on the gun charge that was scheduled for Friday was canceled.

Given the indictment, Ortiz's case now shifts to superior court in Fall River. His arraignment there has not been scheduled.

Hernandez's cousin, Tanya Singleton, also was indicted on a new charge of conspiracy to commit accessory after the fact, Sutter said.

Prosecutors say that in the days after the killing, she drove with Wallace from her home in Bristol, Connecticut, where Wallace had lived at times, to Georgia, where her car broke down, and that she then bought him a bus ticket to Florida, where his family lives.

Singleton had been indicted earlier on a charge of criminal contempt after allegedly refusing to testify before the grand jury hearing evidence in the case. Prosecutors say they offered her immunity.

Lloyd's girlfriend Shaneah  Jenkins recently told NECN that she's 
tired of the focus on Hernandez. Jenkins' sister is engaged to Hernandez.

'Every
time there’s a story out it's always about the alleged murder and it's 
not about the tragedy that happened to Odin,' she said. 'The loss that 
all of us have taken and the fact that he is a human and his life was 
taken.'

Prosecutors claim that Hernandez 
orchestrated Lloyd's killing because he was upset at him for talking to 
people Hernandez had problems with at a nightclub days earlier.

It
has also been suggested that he killed Lloyd because he knew about 
Hernandez's involvement in a 2012 double homicide. Hernandez has never 
been charged in that case.

Hernandez and two other men, Ernest 
Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, allegedly picked Lloyd up at his home in 
Dorchester on June 17 and drove to the industrial park. His body was 
found by a jogger later that day.

Hernandez,
who was dropped by the Patriots within hours of his arrest on June 26, 
could face life in prison without parole if convicted.

Shortly
before Lloyd's death, authorities say, Lloyd sent his sister text 
messages.

He asked if she had seen who he was with when he got into the 
car in Boston.

Then he indicated who it was in a way
that Lloyd's family said he knew his sister would understand. 'NFL,' he
wrote. 'Just so you know.'

Moments
later, authorities say, Lloyd was dead after gunshots rang out in an 
unpaved construction area by a warehouse after he apparently got out of 
the car for what he thought was a bathroom break.

Authorities
have not said who fired the shots, but according to court documents, 
Ortiz told police in Florida that Wallace said it was Hernandez.

Wallace
has pleaded not guilty to a charge of accessory to murder after the 
fact. Ortiz has pleaded not guilty to a firearm charge. Both are being 
held in jail without bail.

Authorities
have said they haven't found the murder weapon, which they believe was a
.45-caliber Glock pistol, but warrants released earlier this month 
suggested Hernandez may have asked his fiancee, Shayanna Jenkins, to 
dispose of it.
