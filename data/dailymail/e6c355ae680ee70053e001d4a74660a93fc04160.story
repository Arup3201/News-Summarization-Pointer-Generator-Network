Australian fighter jets have attacked an Islamic State facility in Iraq.

Two bombs were dropped from an F/A-18F Super Hornet on to an IS facility, the Australian Defence Force said in a statement on Thursday.

"All aircraft exited the target area safely and returned to base," the statement said.

It is the first time Australia has launched air strikes since beginning combat operations on Sunday.

First strike: Australia has launched its first airstrikes in Iraq. 

Open fire: The RAAF dropped two bombs on an Islamic State facility.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has described the deployment as a 'combat operation', rather than a war.
