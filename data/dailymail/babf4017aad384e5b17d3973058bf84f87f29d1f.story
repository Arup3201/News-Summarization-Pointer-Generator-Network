Looking every inch the royal couple, these pictures show how Prince Albert II and his glamorous wife Princess Charlene celebrated Monaco National Day in style.

The Prince, 54, and Princess, 34, who have been married for 16 months, were seen in the Monaco Palace Courtyard as they led festivities for the country, which was marking its 156th anniversary.

Charlene, who was once an Olympic swimmer for South Africa, looked elegant as she stood next to her smartly-dressed husband in a navy blue dress, matching hat, gloves and heels, holding a purse.

The outfit marked a change to what she wore at previous national day events in the country, with an all-beige ensemble on show last year - and a printed suit in 2010, reported the Huffington Post.

Last month the couple stole the show when they attended the annual Princess Grace Awards in New York, with Charlene dressed in an ivory satin halterneck gown with gold detailing at the neckline.

The gala in Manhattan was named after Prince Albert's late mother, Oscar-winning actress Grace Kelly, and is held annually to raise funds for the U.S.-based Princess Grace Foundation.

The couple were also spotted last month in New York at a pre-event lunch at the upscale French restaurant Daniel, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, where tasting menus start from £120.

They also made a poignant visit last month to the memorial of the former Nazi German death camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau in Poland and laid flowers at its Execution Wall.

The couple walked through the Arbeit Macht Frei (Work Makes You Free) gate into the Auschwitz camp and visited its crematorium and red-brick barracks that house inmates' belongings and hair.

Prince Albert, son of Kelly and Rainer III, is said to be one of the wealthiest royals in the world with a fortune estimated at £624million. He married Charlene, then Wittstock, in a July 2011 ceremony.
