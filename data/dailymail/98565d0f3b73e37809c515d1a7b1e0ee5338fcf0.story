Jamie Schanbaum was 19 when she fell ill with what seemed like flu.

Within weeks she had lost both legs and all her fingers to meningococcal disease - a meningitis-related illness. 

But six years later, staring stoically into the camera, she is now the star of a striking series of photographs honoring survivors.

Beautiful: Jamie, 25, posing atop Helen of Troy, was 19 when she fell ill with what seemed like a nasty flu

Survivors: Julio, 15, from Brazil, lost both his legs to meningococcal disease - a meningitis-related illness

Moving series: Australian photographer Anne Geddes said she wanted to present the children, including Benjamen (pictured) as beautiful pillars of strength, having overcome the often fatal disease

The 25-year-old is one of fifteen young adults and children to pose for the revered photographer Anne Geddes.

In her case, she was fashioned as a Helen Of Troy character.

One young boy decided he was going to do a yoga pose for his portrait.

And a set of twins embraced lovingly - one having lost her limbs, the other unaffected. 

Traumatic: Nine-year-old Ellie-May is embraced by her twin Sophie, who did not contract the disease

As well as empowering the children, such as Harvey (pictured), Geddes hopes to inform parents of the disease

Life-changing: Ambers, five, was two when she almost died of meningitis and doctors had to amputate her legs

Princess-like: Bernadette was struck by the disease just days before her third birthday, Geddes explained

Open: Mackenzie, nine, said he wanted to pick his own pose, before putting his injuries together for the camera

Battling through: Danielle, 20, contracted the disease six years ago but still rides horses

The project started as part of a campaign being jointly run by charities including Meningitis Now and the Meningitides Research Foundation.

It has since grown, however, into a what Geddes sees as her best work to date. 

'I've been photographing for 30 years and I think this would be the most significant project that I've ever done,' the Australian photographer told CBS.

'I wanted the images to be timeless. The vast majority of the 15 survivors [photographed] don't have legs. 

'So I had to find a way to portray them, to give them a sense of strength and their own sense of individuality.' 

The disease is caused by an infection of the meninges cells in the brain and spinal cord which can lead to blood poisoning.

The disease, which affected Elias (pictured), is caused by an infection of the meninges cells in the brain and spinal cord which leads to blood poisoning. Viral meningitis, the other type, is more common but less serious

'They're beautiful': Geddes said the shots of children such as Victoria should be empowering to everyone

Challenge: The children, such as Megan, and their families are overcoming huge obstacles to rebuild their lives

Kate was one of the 15 pictured who suffered symptoms including a headache, fever and cold hands or feet

Devastating: Matteo is just a baby but has already been affected by the disease's devastating affects

Mythical: The images of children such as Aaron are designed to honor them all as survivors to look up to

Symptoms include a severe headache, fever, vomiting, blotchy skin and usually cold hands or feet.

Viral meningitis - the other type - is far more common but less serious.

Other children appearing in the photographs are Harvey Parry, eight, who contracted the condition when he was one, and Ellie-May Challis, who was infected at just 16 months.

In an interview with the Daily Mail last year, Geddes said: ‘As a mother and passionate advocate of children, I want to empower parents to understand meningitis and know how best to protect their children.

‘You only need to look at Amber, Ellie and Harvey to understand the impact of this devastating disease. It really would be your worst nightmare to see any child go through such an ordeal.

‘But at the same time, these children and their families are overcoming huge obstacles to rebuild their lives and these beautiful pictures capture their strength in the face of adversity.’ 

Behind the lens: Geddes is best-known for her photographs of cherub-like babies among flower beds

Mission: She said she is determined to help families understand the dangers of the vaccine-treatable disease
