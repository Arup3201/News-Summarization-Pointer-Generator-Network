Spread out in the sun at Bali police headquarters is the gory evidence being studied by forensic officers investigating the shocking 'body in the suitcase' murder.

And as police scientists sift through the bloodied sheets, pillows and other items of clothing stained with dark red blotches, The MailOnline has been able to confirm exclusively that 19-year-old Heather Mack's claims that she is pregnant are true.

A report from the prison hospital in the Bali capital, Denpasar, has revealed that the young woman who will soon be officially charged with the murder of her mother, 62-year-old US socialite Sheila Mack, is expecting a child.

Laid out in the sun at Bali Police Headquarters are pieces of evidence in the Bali suitcase murder - the taxi, the suitcase, bloodied sheets and pillows and other items from the room at the St Regis Hotel

As she and her 21-year-old boyfriend sit behind bars today eating local food, forensic officers, wearing white gloves, shifted through items collected from the initial crime scene at the plush St Regis Hotel, located beside the beach at Nusa Dua, some 10 miles away.

With the sun beating down on the police yard, the scene was surreal, with the taxi into which the suitcase containing the body of Mrs Mack was loaded, parked there with two bloodied pillows lying on its roof.

On the ground behind it was the silver coloured suitcase, it’s 'priority luggage' label stained with blood, in which the body had somehow been crammed.

Items of clothing were spread out on the ground and many appeared to be stained with blood.

A stone ornament was aslo found in the suitcase, but whether this was used as a murder weapon to batter Mrs Mack remains unclear, as a police  said earlier that a glass ashtray and a vase had been used to kill her

There was also what appeared to be a stone ornament, but whether this was used as a murder weapon to batter Mrs Mack remained unclear today, as a police source had said earlier that a glass ashtray and a vase had been used to kill the woman who was well known in social circles in the US, having once worked with Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.

Also on morbid display were what appeared to be two pairs of jeans and an unidentifiable yellow and red cloth item which appears to be the same item that Tommy Schaeffer is seen wearing in a still from a CCTV camera focused on the hotel lobby either before or after the murder.

The grim task for forensic officers was being carried out today as Indonesians began celebrating tomorrow's (Sun) Independence celebrations.

Ms Mack had claimed to police that she was pregnant and that it was ectopic, so she needed to be released to return to the US for specialist care.

Police at headquarters arranged for her story to be checked out and she was taken to the nearby prison hospital for tests.

Daily Mail Australia was told by an investigating officer today that a medical report confirmed that the young woman was indeed pregnant - but it is highly unlikely her request to be returned to the US will be granted.

Senior officers said that like any other person charged with a crime in Bali they would be subjected to Indonesian law, penalties for serious offences being treated severely.

Horror:
 The blood-stained suitcase where the body of Mrs von Wiese-Mack was 
found. It was left in a cab when Mack and Schaefer checked out of the 
hotel, but they failed to return and the driver went to police

With little chance of receiving bail, Ms Mack (pictured) faces the prospect of giving birth behind bars in a prison hospital - and then facing many years in jail if convicted

With little chance of receiving bail, Ms Mack now faces the prospect of giving birth to her baby behind bars in a prison hospital - and then facing many years in jail, if not sentenced to death by firing squad, should she be convicted.

Her baby will either spend its early years with her in prison if she is convicted, or be cared for by willing families, but one thing is certain - the baby will have no grandmother.

It has not been revealed what arrangements have been made for the return of Mrs Mack's body to the US, but it is believed US officials are working with Indonesian authorities to have the body released as soon as possible.

Police say Ms Mack, seen here surrounded by friends, used her mother's credit card to throw a party
