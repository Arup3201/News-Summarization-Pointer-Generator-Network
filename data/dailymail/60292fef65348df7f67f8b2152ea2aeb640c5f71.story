A devastated mother who is trying to get her Marine veteran son home in time for Christmas may not get her wish as she pleads with Mexican authorities to get her son out of maximum-security prison.

Olivia Hammar, the mother of Jon Hammar, said that though she has hired a lawyer, it will prove difficult to fight the Mexican law which Hammar allegedly violated when he brought his grandfather’s antique shotgun across the border in August.

She said that she’s ‘shattered’ that her son will likely not be home for the holidays, even as news comes that Hammar might need a presidential pardon from Mexican president Enrique Pena to be released.

Going home: Ex-Marine Jon Hammar, pictured from his Mexican jail cell with shackles on his leg, returned to the U.S. last month

Upset: Olivia Hammar, the mother of the Marine veteran, has pleaded for her son to be released and to be returned home before Christmas

Speaking with Fox News, Ms Hammar 
said: ‘The chances of him coming home for Christmas are not looking good
at this point. I’m shattered. He looks so hopeless and as a mother, to 
see your child look like that and not be able to help him, it feels 
obscene.’

She continued that the choice to incarcerate him was ‘an administrative mistake.’ She pleaded for Pena to ‘please release him.’

The first photo of Marine Veteran Jon
Hammar, held captive in one of Mexico’s most infamous prisons for four 
months, has recently been released to the public.

The photo shows Hammar, 27, in a solitary cell inside Matamoros state prison in Tamaulipas, shirtless, barefoot and chained by handcuffs around his right ankle.

He was photographed sitting on an thin mattress with a red blanket in a room with chipped walls and a squalid floor. He does not appear to have any visible injuries.

The email containing the photo was sent anonymously to Hammar's mother from a Yahoo.mx account.

‘His eyes look a little lost,’ his 
mother, Olivia Hammar, told Fox News Latino. ‘It doesn't look like him. I
feel like my blood pressure is through the roof.’

An summer surfing trip turned into a nightmare for Hammar, who was arrested and thrown into the northeastern Mexico prison where he was subjected to death threats.

Trapped: Marine Jon Hammer has been stuck in a Mexican jail since August, when he was detained on a weapons charge

Now, four months after his arrest, his family in South Florida is still fighting to get him back.

Hammar and a friend were on their
way to Costa Rica in August and planned to drive across the Mexican 
border near Matamoros in a Winnebago filled with surfboards and camping 
gear.

Hammar asked U.S. border agents 
what to do with an unloaded shotgun, which his family said belonged to 
his great-grandfather.

'They examined it, they weighed it, they said you have to fill out this form,' his father, also named Jon, told The Associated Press in a phone interview on Tuesday, December 11.

But when Hammar and his friend crossed the border and handed the paperwork to Mexican officials, they impounded the RV and jailed the two men, saying it was illegal to carry that type of gun - which they deemed to be an inch too short.

Hammar's friend was later released because the gun did not belong to him.

The Hammar family's attorney Eddie Varon-Levy said Mexican law prohibits civilians from carrying certain types of guns, like sawed-off shotguns, which can be more easily concealed.

Mexican law prohibits shotguns with a barrel of less than 25 inches.

Varon-Levy said 
Mexican officials measured the barrel on Hammar's shotgun as 24 inches and that it has not been sawed off.

Family members said the gun was 
purchased at Sears and blamed U.S. officials for telling Hammar he could
bring it across the border in the first place.

Hero: Hammar was a combat veteran who had been treated for PTSD just before his arrest in Mexico

Varon-Levy also questioned the way Mexican officials measured the gun, because the measurements can differ depending on where they are taken on the barrel.

He said dealing with Mexican authorities has also been difficult. He said Hammar was brought to court a few weeks ago, where officials tried to convince him to plead guilty without a lawyer present. 

Varon-Levy said he didn't show up because he was told there was a continuance.

'I am fuming,' he said.

Hammar could face 12 years in prison, but Varon-Levy said that is unlikely.

He wants to get the charges downgraded, in hopes that Hammar can plead guilty to a lesser charge of carrying an unregistered weapon, which carries only a fine.

Hammar served in Iraq and Afghanistan before being honorably discharged from the Marines in 2007.

His mother said surfing helped him cope after he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

Hammar developed PTSD following the death of a fellow Marine who was killed by a sniper's bullet 
when the two served together in Fallujah, Iraq.

He had just completed 
treatment at a center for veterans in California last year, 
before getting detained during his misadventure in Matamoros.

Weapon in question: Hammar had his great-grandfather's antique rifle inspected at the border, but he was arrested for carrying it anyway

Ricardo Alday, spokesman for the Mexican Embassy, said in a statement: 'Mexican authorities have fully guaranteed his right to Consular assistance; therefore Mr Hammar has been in contact with U.S. Consular officers in Mexico who have regularly visited him.

'The possession of any weapon restricted for the use of the Army in Mexico is a Federal crime, regardless of whether you declare it or not upon entering the country, and must be automatically prosecuted.'

Alday said Harmmar has the right to defense counsel and a fair trial 'as any other detainee facing criminal charges.

'In addition, his life and integrity are protected by national and international laws.'

In danger: Hammar is periodically shackled to his bed in a cell by himself and subjected to death threats and extortion demands from cartel gangsters

Still, Hammar is being held in one of the most dangerous areas in Mexico.

Matamoros is the active headquarters of the Gulf Cartel, which has been fighting with its former running drug routes along the eastern end of the Texas-Mexico border.

A fight among inmates at the prison in October 2011 left 20 dead and 12 injured.

When first arrested Hammar was held with the prison's general population, which is filled mostly with members of drug cartels.

Now, the 27-year-old marine veteran is periodically shackled to his bed in a cell by himself and subjected to death threats and extortion demands from cartel gangsters, according to his father.

The two occasionally speak to one another over the phone.

'Sometimes he's got his head on good. We're like just, "Hang in there. We're doing everything we can,"' said Jon Hammar Senior, a 48-year-old software engineer.

'Other days, it's like, it's not as good,'

In August, the family received a frightening middle of the night phone call from the cartel demanding money, Jon Hammar Senior said.

'"Lady, this isn't about the police. This is our house. We have your son. We're going to kill him if you don't send us money,"' Jon Hammar Senior said, recounting the phone call.

The couple planned to wire the money to an account, but officials at the U.S. consulate intervened and contacted prison officials.

His son was moved into a private cell the next day, he said.

Peter Velasco, a spokesman for the State Department, said officials have visited Hammar three times, spoken with him by phone and contacted prison officials to stop them from chaining him to the bed.

'The safety and well-being of U.S. citizens is something we take very seriously,' said Velasco.

U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, spoke on the Senate floor Tuesday, December 11, asking Mexican authorities to release Hammar.

Jailed: Hammar was taken into custody right after crossing the border from Brownsivlle, Texas, and is now being held at a prison in Matamoros

U.S. Rep Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, of Florida, said: 'This is just an outrageous case.'

She was contacted by Hammar's mother Olivia, who asked the Republican congresswoman for help.

She added: 'If the parents had not told me about it, and his friends had not gotten involved, I would say that it was just not possible for someone to be in so much trouble for doing the right thing.'

Ros-Lehtinen also urged the State Department to work incessantly to reunite Hammar with his family and said she's disappointed the agency has not told her what efforts have been made.

The Miami Republican said she plans to contact the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Patrol about Hammar's arrest.

'The Hammar family has suffered a great deal since their son's unjust incarceration in August and the details they have provided to my office are gripping and a clear abuse of Jon's human rights,' she said in a statement.

Supporters set up a Facebook page Free Jon Hammar, which now has over 6,500 supporters.
