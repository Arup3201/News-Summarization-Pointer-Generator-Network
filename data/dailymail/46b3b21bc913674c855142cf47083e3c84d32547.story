An Amazonian man has moved from an isolated village in the rainforest to the concrete jungle of New York City.

Nilson Tuwe Huni Kui left his tribe in Brazil, with a population of only 600 people, to move to the Big Apple to tell the world about his people and the hardships they face.

The 29-year-old is the son of traditional chief of the Huni Kiu Kaxinawa in the Western Amazon, who he says is ‘equivalent to Obama’.

Long way from home: Nilson Tuwe Huni Kui has moved to New York City from his village in the Western Amazon in Brazil to learn English and to become a filmmaker

Mr Kui spoke to BBC about his trip to New York where he will spend a total of nine months studying filmmaking and being a spokesperson and ‘messenger’ for his people.

He said: ‘I came to New York City directly from the rainforest.

‘My dream is to learn English and to meet people and show them my culture and get support for my people.’

'Directly from the rainforest': Mr Kui moved from his village with a population of only 600 people to be a spokesperson for his people and the problems they face

The
indigenous filmmaker was given the opportunity to study in New York 
because of the Tribal Link’s Indigenous Fellowship Program and the 
Nataasha van Kampen Foundation after a summit last year in Rio de 
Janeiro.

He is learning English, filmmaking and editing, and is making a documentary film about his tribe called ‘Us and Them’ about voluntary isolation and the problems his people face such as illegal loggers and drug cartels. 

Culture shock: Arriving in New York in September last year, Mr Kui has grappled with culture shock, learning how to use the subway and taking in the vast array of people from all over the world, the American food and the 'very, very cold weather'

Riding the subway: While in New York, Mr Kui catches the train, it takes five days travel by boat to reach his village from the nearest town

'Show them my culture': Mr Kui is making a film about his tribe and some of the hardships they face including illegal logging and drug cartels

Mr Kui said: ‘Through technology you can learn about the world and the world can learn about you.

‘I’m working on a movie about the people who live in voluntary isolation. I’d like to become a professional filmmaker to help my people.’

Arriving in New York in September last year, Mr Kui has grappled with culture shock, learning how to use the subway and take in the vast array of different people from all over the world, the American food and the ‘very, very cold weather’.

Young leader: The 29-year-old is the son of the traditional chief of the Huni Kiu Kaxinawa who he says is 'equivalent to Obama'

Tribal culture: Mr Kiu said his people are 'rich in biodiversity, in culture and in spirituality'

He said: ‘People may think that richness is about money but for us in the rainforest being rich is something else. We are rich in biodiversity, in culture and in spirituality.’

It takes five days travel by boat to reach his village from the nearest town. The people prefer an isolated existence and avoid contact with the outside world.

The Indigenous Fellowship Program aims to help indigenous peoples from all over the world get education and training in a field of their interest to ultimately improve life for their native community.
