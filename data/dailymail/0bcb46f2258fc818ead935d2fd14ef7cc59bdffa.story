Two leading women's charities have warned making it illegal for women to drink while they are pregnant could 'undermine their autonomy

Drinking during pregnancy could be classed as a criminal offence, in light of a landmark case due to be heard at the Court of Appeal tomorrow.

A council in North West England is seeking criminal injuries compensation for a six-year-old girl with 'growth retardation', caused by her mother's alcohol consumption during pregnancy.

If the court agrees that the woman committed a crime, it could pave the way for a pregnant woman's behaviour to be criminalised.

However two women's charities have warned that any such ruling could 'seriously undermine women's autonomy while pregnant and their freedom to make decisions for themselves'.

The case is of 'profound social significance' and could establish a legal precedent which could be used to prosecute women who drink while pregnant.

There are fears it could mean other aspects of women's behaviour - such as medication taken during pregnancy or her choice of childbirth - could also have damning implications. 

Charities also fear women with addictions could choose to abort their unborn children rather than face criminal prosecution.

Ann Furedi, chief executive of bpas, and Rebecca Schiller, co-chair of Birthrights, said: 'Making one particular form of behaviour during pregnancy into a criminal offence would lay the ground for criminalising a wide range of other behaviours because they may too pose a risk to the health of the baby.'

Similar developments in the U.S. have resulted in women being imprisoned. 

As a result, the National Advocates for Pregnant Women in the country has urged caution over this UK case. 

It has called on the court to 'reject efforts to create criminal penalties as a mechanism for addressing health problems women may face during pregnancy'.

In the case, to be heard this week, the little girl was born with Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS), which can cause stunted growth, facial abnormalities and intellectual impairment.

The syndrome was diagnosed 252 times in England between 2012 and 2013.

But the charities claim that there is 'continuing uncertainty' in the medical profession over the relationship between drinking and harm to the foetus.

And they say mothers and their babies would not be best served by treating pregnant women with drug or alcohol abuse problems as criminals.

The Court of Appeal will decide if the mother of a six-year-old girl born with foetal alcohol syndrome committed a crime in drinking alcohol while she was pregnant. The case could set a legal precedent, criminalising women's behaviours while they are expecting

Lawyers representing the local authority are seeking to prove the six-year-old's mother committed a crime under the Offences Against the Persons Act 1861.

The case will be heard at the Court of Appeal tomorrow. 

In January, it emerged they had failed in their bid to win compensation on the child's behalf from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA).

A written ruling by the Upper Tribunal of the Administrative Appeals Chamber said the child was born with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder as a 'direct result' of her mother's drinking.

Foetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is a complex condition, denoting a collection of features including retarded growth, facial abnormalities and intellectual impairment.

There remains uncertainty in the medical community over the relationship between alcohol consumption and harm to the foetus.

While it occurs in babies born to alcoholic women, most babies of alcoholic women will not be affected, as other factors, including nutritional status, genetic make-up of mother and foetus, age and general health, are also thought to play a role.

There were 252 diagnoses of FAS in England in 2012 to 2013. 

But it concluded: 'If (the girl) was not a person while her mother was engaging in the relevant actions then... as a matter of law, her mother could not have committed a criminal offence.'

Neither the girl nor the mother was identified in the ruling. 

bpas and Birthrights said criminalising mothers is not the way to best help them or their children.

Instead, pregnant women with addiction problems need rapid access to specialist support services, as do children born with disability caused by drug or alcohol abuse.

Ms Furedi and Ms Schiller said: 'Viewing these cases as potential criminal offences will do nothing for the health of women and their babies.

'There is a strong public interest in promoting the good health of pregnant women and babies, but, as long-standing government policy recognises, this interest is best served by treating addiction and substance abuse in pregnancy as a public health, not criminal, issue.

'As well as undermining women's ability to make their own choices while pregnant, women with substance addictions may avoid engaging with health services or feel compelled to terminate their pregnancy rather than continue and face criminal sanctions.

'It could also make health professionals responsible for reporting women in their care to the police.  

'Both the immediate and broader implications of this case are troubling.'
