These touching - and sometimes hilarious - photos show the lengths three brothers went to to make their mom smile.

The MacMillan brothers, led by the eldest, Matt, trawled back through old family photos are recreated the images now they are fully grown.

After pulling off the snaps - which look far more bizarre with grown-ups - they compiled them into a gift for their delighted mom, Vickie MacMillan.

The three even roped in their father for some of the images. He too is showing the difference after several decades, but does look more recognizable than his sons.

According to ABC News, the three brothers, from Pennsylvania, got the idea for their project because their mom had asked for calendars as gifts in the past.

The images caught the attention of the internet after the brothers posted them on image-sharing forums - resulting in millions of eyes on their childhood memories.

A little help: The brothers' father also mucked in for the project, which the boys then posted online

Bit heavier now: This scene outside a church was a bit more difficult to pull of with full-grown men

Speaking to ABC, Matt said: 'We took off work and school for a day, so we could take the pictures without our mom knowing.

'We must have taken about 20 pictures of each scene trying to get the perfect facial expressions and poses.'

The result was said to prompt tears of joy in their mother, who said she finds something new to love in the gifts every day. 

Fun at home: The boys bought bigger versions of their own clothes and tried to bring back their hapless youthful expressions

Party time: Although a properly-sized dinosaur costume was seemingly not available, the boys managed to mostly recreate their costumes here
