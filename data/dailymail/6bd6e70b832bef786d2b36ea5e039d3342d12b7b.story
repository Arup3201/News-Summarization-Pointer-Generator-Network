Former WAG Lizzie Cundy has gone head-to-head with author Kathy Lette after the writer called footballer wives and girlfriends 'bad role models' who are nothing more than 'life support systems to a pair of breasts'.

Lette said such women 'live vicariously' through their partners, while Cundy - who used to be married to footballer Jason Cundy - maintained that supporting one's footballing husband or boyfriend is an arduous and admirable way to live, and should be applauded accordingly.

The two appeared today on ITV's This 
Morning to debate the question of whether or not young girls should 
aspire to be WAGS, and the audience voted overwhelmingly with Lette, who called such women 'sabre-toothed husband hunters whose only skills are sports car alighting with minimum knicker flashing'.

The two women were at loggerheads during the ITV debate about WAGs as role models

The author said: What upsets me is that when they do research into schools, what young girls want to be is famous. Not doctors or lawyers, just famous. WAGS are just life support systems to a pair of breasts.

'Why do people aspire to be with footballers? They all treat women like footballs. They drop them as soon as they've scored.'

Cundy admonished Lette for her cliched, stereotypical view of footballer partners, saying: 'Who do you know in the footballing world, Kathy? The majority of the girls I know all have jobs, all work, do so much for charity and do great 
things, and what you are saying is absolutely appalling.'

'I write. I have a column in Closer and the Express and I do red carpet work. And I'm in a musical about WAGs. You should come and see it, Kathy.'

Kathy Lette and Lizzie Cundy agreed to disagree on This Morning

Kathy said: 'I think WAGs the acronym stands for Worst Acronym for Girls, ever. 100 years since Emmeline Pankhurst tied herself to the railings, at the 2006 Fifa cup we had women aspiring to little more than being a human handbag, draped decoratively over the arm of some knight in shining Armani football player.'

Cundy fought back, saying: 'I was at both world cups when 
the media yourselves put them up there as WAGs, they named us WAGs they 
put them on the front of the papers because they were selling the 
papers. People were interested in them, the girls were there to support 
their husband and I think that is admirable.'

Lette added that her father was a famous footballer so her mother was a WAG: 'But she always had a career and independent identity. What I disagree with is women living vicariously through men and being seen as subservient and decorative.'

In the This Morning worm poll, 76 per cent of viewers agreed with Lette that WAGs are not good role models.
