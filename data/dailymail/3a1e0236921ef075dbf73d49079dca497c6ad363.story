The are the smartest headphones on the planet - and could mean the end of tangled wires.

The Dash headphones are wireless, and can even be worn when swimming.

They contain their own MP3 player and fitness trackers to monitor heart rate and oxygen saturation level.

The headphones communicate with a mobile phone via bluetooth, and also have their own MP3 player and fitness tracking sensors built in.

To use them, users simply tap the control earphone, or use a special app on their iPhone. They can even set commands to be triggered simply by tilting their head.

Each Dash headphone has its own microcomputer, coupled with biosensors, fitness trackers and microphones.

They use Bluetooth to link together and to a mobile phone.

Two tiny LEDs emit low intensity red and infrared light into the capillaries in the ear to monitor heart rate and oxygen saturation.

They also have 4gb of storage for music. 

The Dash consists of a pair of discrete and completely wireless stereo earphones, linked togeth with Bluetooth.

The entire chassis of The Dash is filled with silicone, making it waterproof - they can even be used while swimming. 

To use them, users simply tap the control earphone. 

They will playback music through a Bluetooth connection or use the embedded 4GB/1000 song music player. 

The Berlin firm behind them says they are: 'The world's first completely wireless, smart headphone system, offering freedom of movement, maximum comfort and amazing sound – all while audibly coaching, tracking movement and capturing key biometric data.'

The Dash are two wearable microcomputers, coupled with biosensors, fitness trackers, microphones, a real-time feedback activity coach, and The Dash media player

This week the Dash won the International Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2015 Innovation Award. 

'We are over the moon with the response that we have been receiving' said Nikolaj Hviid of Bragi, the Berlin firm behind them.

'The competition here is very tough but we continue to create a lot of market attention for our groundbreaking product The Dash.' 

The Dash can also pick up the ambient sound with the ambient microphones, channel the sound through to The Dash and mix it together with the music you already are hearing. 

Two tiny LEDs emit low intensity red and infrared light into the capillaries in the ear. 

The optical reflection of the emitted light reveal the relative amount of red and white blood cells more than 50 times every second. 

A precise heart rate and oxygen saturation level is calculated with the data. 

The firm has even been tested the headphones with athletes.

'The Dash's ability to tell us how long we have exercised for, or how fast we are moving, while delivering heart rate readings and oxygen saturation level, puts this device as one of the most innovative pieces of audio technology,' said Helle Frederiksen, and Olympic Triathlete

 The firm originally launched the headphones as a Kickstarter campaign, which was a record breaking success.

Almost 16.000 supporters worldwide  pledged more than US$ 3.3 million on kickstarter. 

This makes The Dash still the most successful European crowdfunding campaign on kickstarter ever.

The headphones can also be linked to an app for playback of music on an iPhopne
