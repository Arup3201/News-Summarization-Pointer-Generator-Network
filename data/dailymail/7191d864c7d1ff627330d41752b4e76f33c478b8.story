The parents of a murder victim were devastated when they overheard a judge say victim impact statements ‘make no difference’ at a parole hearing for one of their son’s killers.

Geraldine and Peter McGinty, who had made their statement on a video link, heard judge Graham White’s comments when the link was accidentally left open.

Their son Colin, 21, was stabbed to death in 2001 by a gang of four men, in what police suspect was a case of mistaken identity.

Two of the killers, doormen Gary Hampton, 26, and Michael Brown, 24, were caught and were sentenced to life imprisonment, but recently applied to the Parole Board to be moved to an open prison.

Mr McGinty’s parents, who opposed the move, were invited to read a victim statement to the judge before he came to a decision. In their statement at Brown’s hearing, they said they were ‘serving a life sentence of heartache and grief and pain’.

Mrs McGinty, 58, told the BBC: ‘The judge was sympathetic and thanked us for reading the statement and said he was closing the link.

‘They couldn’t hear us or see us any longer but we still had the link open and could see and hear them.

‘The judge turned round and said to someone else in the room, “I feel so very sorry for these families. They make these statements thinking they are going to make a difference, but they make no difference at all. Someone should tell them”.’

Mother-of-five Mrs McGinty, who described Colin as a ‘fabulous son’, added: ‘It was as though time stopped. Peter and I looked at each in disbelief, we were dumbfounded.

‘The heartache that we go through to do these statements, to be told they don’t make any difference.’

Judge White apologised for his remark, which he said was made in a ‘private conversation’. 

He said: ‘I am sorry if what they overheard upset them and if it made them feel that what they had said had no impact because it certainly did, but what it can’t do is affect our judgment of his [Brown’s] risk.

‘We don’t think that victims necessarily have explained to them what the role of the board is and what we have to take into account.’

Parole Board chairman Sir David Calvert-Smith said there would be an investigation into what was said. 

He added that victims should be told what their statements may or may not achieve. 

In a hearing, the Parole Board assesses the risk a prisoner poses, taking into account their offending history, their progress and reports from psychologists and prison officers.

The board says victims can ‘play an important part’ in helping them reach a decision and can affect the conditions of release, such as an order not to contact victims.

But Mr and Mrs McGinty, from Formby, Merseyside, said the Parole Board has been misleading about the role of victim statements. 

Mr McGinty said: ‘What is the point? Why are we being put through pain and heartbreak for no apparent reason? I feel the judge was an honourable man and he was very, very honest. We were privy to a conversation that we would not normally be. So I just feel he’s very honest.’

Mrs McGinty added: ‘I’m pleased we heard that statement because it’s not just for us, it’s for other victims’ families. We go through so much anyway, but then to realise the pain that you’ve gone through trying to make a difference for your loved-one isn’t making any difference at all ... they’re not being truthful to victims’ families.’

'Sorry': Judge Graham White apologised to the family after remarking that their words will 'make no difference'

In their statement, Mr and Mrs McGinty described how they rushed to hospital after Colin was stabbed 15 times on a night out.

They said: ‘We were allowed to be with Colin while the operating theatre was prepared. That sight of Colin will haunt us forever.’ His last words to his father were: ‘I can’t breathe.’

Following the hearing, recommendations have been made that both of Colin’s murderers should be transferred to open prisons.
