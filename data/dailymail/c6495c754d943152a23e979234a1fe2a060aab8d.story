Russian oligarchs and Middle Eastern oil magnates who've spent the past year salivating over the Pierre Hotel penthouse originally priced at record-breaking $125million are in luck, as the exclusive property has just been relisted for half price.

With a new asking price of 'only' $63million, the 16-bedroom triplex - the former home of the late financial analyst Martin Zweig - is widely considered a steal by New York real estate experts.

In December 2013, after about eight months on the market, the lavish apartment's eye-watering asking price was slashed down to $95million, but by Christmas the property was yanked off the market altogether.

On sale: The Pierre Hotel penthouse originally priced at record-breaking $125million has just been relisted for $63million 

Sticker shock: At whopping $125million, the 16-bedroom triplex was considered the most expensive apartment in the history of New York City real estate 

On top of the world: The Pierre Hotel penthouse on Fifth Avenue occupies the 41st, 42nd, and 43rd floors of the Upper East Side hotel

A year later, the owner of the palatial digs, Martin Zweig's widow Barbara, re-listed the penthouse for 49.6 per cent off the original asking price.

Mrs Zweig's late husband famously predicted the 1987 market crash three days before it happened. 

Brown Harris Stevens realtor Mary Rutherford, who took over the listing from Sotheby's International Realty, told the Wall Street Journal that the new, more affordable price tag is 'right in the middle' of New York’s luxury apartment market. 

The Pierre Hotel penthouse on Fifth Avenue occupies the 41st, 42nd, and 43rd floors of the Upper East Side hotel and has 16 rooms, six bathrooms and five fireplaces beneath 23-foot ceilings.

The opulent home offers 360-degree views over Manhattan, Central Park and the Hudson and East Rivers - and for even better views, the owners can step onto one of the four terraces.

Opulent: The Pierre Hotel penthouse on Fifth Avenue has gone on sale for a staggering $125 million

Luxury: The lavish property occupies three floors and has 16 bedrooms, six bathrooms and four kitchens

Nooks and cranies: The over-the-top triplex has 16 rooms, six bathrooms and five fireplaces beneath 23-foot ceilings

There are arched cathedral windows and fireplaces designed in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries - including one in the private gym.

Other features include a Swedish sauna, three powder rooms, a private elevator that services all three floors and three kitchenettes as well as a main kitchen.

There's also a grand wooden staircase, a library with 18th-century paneling and a guest suite with two bedrooms, three bathrooms, a kitchen and two living areas.

But prospective buyers will not be able to spend all their cash on the home because they'll also need to cover the monthly maintenance bill of $47,000 for electricity and two housekeeping staff.

What a welcome: The entrance has an impressive wooden staircase and two reception rooms

Historic: There are four fireplaces at the home, which were designed in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries

For sale: The property was previously owned by stock market analyst Martin Zweig who died in February 2013

Martin Zweig, who died in February at the age of 70, bought the home for $21.5million in 1999, which was also a record for the time.

Matthew Dwyer, the real estate adviser to
 the Zweigs, said they immediately snapped up the penthouse after viewing it.

'They were 
looking around for a place to call home in the city and were just sort 
of surprised by it,' he told the New York Times. 'They walked in, saw the totality of the 
space, and they fell in love with it.

Now that's a view! The opulent home offers 360-degree views over Manhattan, Central Park and the Hudson and East Rivers

Downgraded: In December 2013, after about eight months on the market, the lavish apartment's eye-watering asking price was slashed down to $95million

Attraction: The Zweigs immediately fell in love with the home for its space and 360-degree views

'They saw it as a one-of-a-kind 
home that could be a lot of fun to live in, and a place that was not 
likely ever to be replicated.'

The Pierre Hotel underwent a $100 million 
renovation in 2005, and is now a hotel and residence building managed by 
Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces.
