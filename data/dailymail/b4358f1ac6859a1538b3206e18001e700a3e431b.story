The standard of living in Britain has risen to become the fourth highest in the whole of Europe, a new study showed today.

Average spending power per person is now only behind Luxembourg, Germany and Austria, according the Europe’s official statistics watchdog.

Life in the UK is now ranked alongside popular Scandinavian countries like Denmark, Sweden and Finland.

New figures from Eurostat show that the UK was ranked joint fourth for living standards in 2013, equal to Denmark, Finland and Sweden

Labour leader Ed Miliband today renewed his attack on the government, accusing the Tories of wanting to embark on deep spending cuts which would lead to a ‘permanent cost of living crisis’.

But today’s figures show that compared to other EU countries, Britain is faring better than most.

In the UK, living standards – expressed as Actual Individual Consumption per capita – was 15 per cent higher than the EU average.

In Luxembourg, it was 36 per cent higher, Germany 22 per cent and Austria 20 per cent.

Between 2012 and 2013, living standards fell in Luxemburg, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, Cyprus, Portugal, Greece, Malta, Lithuania, Slovenia and Bulgaria.

Overall Lithuania, Slovenia, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia were between 20 per cent and 30 per cent below the average, while Estonia, Latvia, Hungary and Croatia were between 30 per cent and

40 per cent below. Romania was just under 40 per cent below the average, while Bulgaria was around 50 per cent below the average.

A Treasury spokesman said: ‘Today’s news that the UK has risen to have the fourth highest standard of living in the EU provides further evidence that the government’s long-term economic plan is working.

‘But the job is not done and so the government will go on taking the difficult decisions needed to secure a responsible recovery and stay on course to prosperity.’

AIC per head is used as a measure of families’ standard of living as it covers spending on all goods and services that a household consumes, including benefits-in-kind, such as health and education services.

The Office for National Statistics found that prices paid by UK families were sixth highest in the EU in 2013, in line with Belgium and the Netherlands.

Denmark remained the most expensive place to live, with prices 42 per cent above the EU average, while prices in Bulgaria at 56 per cent below remained the lowest.

In a major speech on the economy today, Mr Miliband pledged a Labour government would tackle the deficit ‘as soon as possible’ but admitted it could take until 2010.

And he issued a warning about the risk to living standards of Tory plans to balance the books sooner: ‘I want the British people to know what this really means: it is a recipe for the disintegration of our public services.

‘And, also, for a permanent cost of living crisis because we won’t be investing in the skills, infrastructure and education we need for good quality jobs.’

He rejected criticism of Labour’s economic plan. ‘For some time, I have heard people claim that our economic argument around the cost of living crisis has been missing the main economic challenge, of tackling the deficit.

‘But the facts are now in: it turns out that tackling the cost of living crisis is in fact essential for tackling the deficit.

‘For the first three years of the Parliament, we saw little or no growth in the economy.

‘And as a result the government spectacularly failed in their deficit reduction strategy.

‘Now, finally, growth has resumed, but what became clear in the Autumn Statement is that the character of growth is such that they are still failing.’
