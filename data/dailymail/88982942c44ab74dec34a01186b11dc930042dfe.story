Nobody was more relieved than Ritchie Humphreys as Chesterfield staged a remarkable second-half comeback to keep alive their hopes of an FA Cup fourth round meeting with Derby.

The Chesterfield midfielder presented Lyle Taylor with a goal in the 44th minute - and looked to have sent Scunthorpe towards the next round.

Taylor latched on to a weak header by Humphreys to advance and drill the ball past goalkeeper Tommy Lee.

It was a key moment in the tie because Chesterfield were threatening to hit back after going behind to a 19th minute strike from Alex Davey.

Davey, whose loan from Chelsea has been extended until the end of the season, finished in style when he collected a clearance just outside the area.

It was a massive setback for Chesterfield, who won their third round tie against MK Dons only four days earlier after being ordered to replay it because they used an ineligible player in the first meeting.

They responded to Davey's goal by creating a string of chances for Armand Gnanduillet, Romuald Doyle and Eoin Doyle, but failed to take any of them.

And Chesterfield piled on the pressure in the second-half, with Sam Slocombe saving brilliantly from Sam Clucas in the 57th minute.

They pulled a goal back in the 71st minute when Doyle stroked in a penalty after a foul on Gary Roberts. 

And Chesterfield got their deserved equaliser when Roberts pulled the ball back and O'Shea drilled the ball beyond Lee in the 85th minute.

Scunthorpe also went close to a stoppage time goal when Madden's shot was well saved by Lee.

Chesterfield manager Paul Cook said:'It was a fantastic comeback, but it was the least we deserved.

'We conceded goals against the run of play in the first-half and it is always hard to come back from 2-0. We were very disappointed with their second goal because that is always important in any games.

'But we know our lads are fit and it's a credit to everyone at the club that we came back so well.

'Scunthorpe are a very good side and we showed how both of us want to play Derby. Now whoever goes through will deserve to go through.'

Chesterfield boss Mark Robins said:'It was certainly an entertaining tie. Chesterfield are a good sde with a depth of squad that is better than ours. We have to put some square pegs in round holes and it makes a difference.

'The second goal gave us a good cushion, but we knew they would put us under pressure. We knew it was coming and we talked about it and tried to organise.

'It's up to the players to cut out the danger and we did it until later in the game when we looked a little bit tired and they made changes that made a difference.'
