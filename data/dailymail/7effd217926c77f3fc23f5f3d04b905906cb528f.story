Barack Obama, David Cameron and Richard Branson are all ‘global warming Nazis’.

This is according to scientist Roy Spencer, who is a professor at the University of Alabama at Huntsville and a vocal denier of man-made climate change.

Dr Spencer believe that people who label those against human-induced global warming ‘climate deniers’ will ‘kill far more people than the Nazis ever did.’

The radical claim was made by climate scientist Roy Spencer, who is a professor at the University of Alabama at Huntsville and a vocal denier of man-made climate change

He argues, these same people should be appropriately labelled as ‘global warming Nazis.’

‘When politicians and scientists started calling people like me “deniers”, they crossed the line. They are still doing it,’ he wrote in a blog post published yesterday.

David Cameron is known to have used the term 'climate change denier' along with Barack Obama, Richard Branson, Nick Clegg and Ed Davey

Use of the term 'climate deniers' became controversial 
after John Howard, former Australian Prime Minister, said that the 
term was used with 'malice aforethought'.

But In November, deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said he is entitled to call Tory climate sceptics 'deniers' despite a warning by the government's chief scientist that it is an abusive term.

'Surely I can agree with his scientific advice without agreeing with the choice of verbs, adjectives or nouns,' Clegg said.

Sir Mark Walport told MPs last year that he was uncomfortable with the term. He said: 'As far as possible it is always best to avoid abuse.

'People do get heated and emotional about this. But we have to be clear that those who argue against the human contribution of climate change are wrong.'

‘They indirectly equate the sceptics' view that global warming is not necessarily all manmade nor a serious problem, with the denial that the Nazi's extermination of millions of Jews ever happened’ wrote Spencer on his blog.

‘Too many of us for too long have ignored the repulsive, extremist nature of the comparison,’ he continues. ‘It's time to push back.'

His reasoning in using the word Nazis is because climate activists are, in his words, 'anti-capitalist fascists'.

‘[They are] willing to sacrifice millions of lives of poor people at the altar of radical environmentalism,’ he wrote.

The words come from a prominent figure in debates surrounding climate change.

Dr Spencer has been a called number of times by the Republican Party to give evidence to Congress.

But the term ‘climate change denier’ isn’t hated by everyone.

Dr Richard Lindzen, when asked which descriptive term he preferred, said: ‘I actually like “denier.” That's closer than "sceptic"’.

Steve Milloy, the operator of the climate change denial website JunkScience.com, told Popular Science, ‘Me, I just stick with "denier" ... I'm happy to be a denier.’

Dr Spencer has previously said: ‘I view my job a little like a legislator, supported by the taxpayer, to protect the interests of the taxpayer and to minimise the role of government.’

In the opening and closing of his blog, he writes: ‘Yeah, somebody pushed my button.'

'Deniers' are termed people that believe that global warming is either not occurring, or is not associated with the man-made rise in carbon dioxide.

They have been heavily criticised for being pseudoscientific, despite an alleged overwhelming consensus on the reality of climate change.

Journalists and policitican - including environmentalist George Monbiot - have described such scepticism as a form of denialism.

Several commentators have also compared climate change denial with Holocaust denial, although others who believe in man-made climate change have condemned such comparisons as inappropriate and trivialising Holocaust denial.

Monbiot wrote in his Guardian opinion column that he uses the term for those who attempt to undermine scientific opinion on climate change due to financial interests.

Monbiot often refers to a 'denial industry', however other commentators have been described climate change 'deniers', including politicians and writers, who are not obviously linked to any industry group.

In recent years the term has been associated with a series of views challenging the scientific consensus on issues including the health effects of smoking and the relationship between HIV and AIDS, along with climate change.
