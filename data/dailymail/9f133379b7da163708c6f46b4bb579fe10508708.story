Nick Clegg's £2.5billion pupil premium has failed to narrow the gap between the achievements of the poorest schoolchildren and their wealthier counterparts

Underprivileged pupils fell further behind better off children last year despite Nick Clegg’s flagship policy to narrow the exam gap between them.

The gulf widened in 72 out of 152 local authorities in a year despite extra funding from the pupil premium policy, according to Left-wing think-tank Demos.

This included 66 where the difference was larger than before the premium was introduced.

The analysis was based on the number of pupils gaining five or more GCSEs with a C grade or higher, including English and maths.

The achievement gap is measured by the difference between the results of those pupils receiving free school meals and those whose parents pay for their children’s school dinners.

Last summer’s exam results revealed it had reached 26.7 percentage points across England, up from 26.4 points in 2011-12. In 2010-11 it was 27.5 percentage points.

But if inner London is removed – where the difference closed from 18.9 percentage points to 18.6 points over three years – the average gap in 2012-13 rises to 29.5 points.

The capital has benefited from another initiative, the London Challenge, which has improved academic results for poorer children by pouring millions of pounds into schools.

The lack of progress made nationwide since the £2.5billion-a-year pupil premium was introduced in April 2011 is an embarrassment for the Deputy Prime Minister, who included it in the 2010 Lib Dem manifesto.

It comes just a week after another of 
his policies, to double the number of free nursery places for deprived 
two-year-olds, was criticised for threatening to lower standards unless 
it was delayed.

The Sutton Trust education charity 
warned many of the extra staff needed would be former childminders, who 
tend to have lower qualifications than nursery workers.

The
 pupil premium was introduced in April 2011. At present, the scheme provides primaries with an extra £953 for each child on free school meals and secondaries with £900 for each such pupil.

Exam results from last year show that in 72 out of 152 local authorities the 'attainment gap' widened, and in 66 the difference was greater than before the premium was brought in

The widest gaps were found in the South East, with 42.5 per cent in Wokingham, Berkshire, and 39.6 per cent in Buckinghamshire.

London
 had the three smallest gaps - 4.2 per cent in Kensington and Chelsea, 
7.7 per cent in Southwark and 9.5 per cent in Lambeth.

Ian
 Wybron, an education specialist at the think tank Demos, said: 'The 
attainment gap has been a difficult nut to crack in recent years.

'The
 pupil premium is supposed to finally close it and is a good policy in 
theory.' A separate report out today says social class is still 
'exerting a powerful influence' on the skills of English adults.

The Institute of Education in London said the attainment gap that opens up at school carries on into adulthood.

It
 added: 'The relationship between parental background and adult literacy
 and numeracy among those aged 16 to 24 is stronger in England than in 
all other countries except the Slovak Republic.'

A
 Department for Education spokesman said that since 2010 the achievement
 gap had fallen faster than at any time since 2002. ‘We are taking 
decisive action to support disadvantaged pupils and close that 
unacceptable gap,’ he added.
