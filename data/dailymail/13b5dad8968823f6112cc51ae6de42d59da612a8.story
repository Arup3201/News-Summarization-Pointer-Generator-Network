Two police staff could face charges over the treatment of Bijan Ebrahimi (pictured) who was murdered by a vigilante who branded him a paedophile

Two civilian police staff could face charges over the treatment of a disabled man murdered by a vigilante who branded him a paedophile. 

Bijan Ebrahimi, 44, repeatedly contacted Avon and Somerset Police complaining that he was the victim of anti-social behaviour and was being targeted by his neighbours in Bristol.

Mr Ebrahimi begged officers to help, telling them he did not feel safe in his home, hours before he was beaten to death and his body set on fire by neighbour Lee James in July last year.

James, of  Brislington, Bristol pleaded guilty to murder and was jailed for life with a minimum term of 18 years.

Stephen Norley, who lived next door to James, pleaded guilty to assisting an offender after obtaining white spirit and helping to drag Mr Ebrahimi's body to where it was set alight. He was jailed for four years.

A post-mortem examination found Mr Ebrahimi suffered 'multiple heavy blows to the face and head' and died before he was set alight. 

The Independent Police Complaints Commission has now sent a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service in relation to a call handler and a dispatch supervisor for Avon and Somerset Police.

The CPS must decide whether criminal charges should be brought on the basis of the evidence the IPCC has uncovered. 

The IPCC said it had completed its investigation into police treatment of Mr Ebrahimi in the days before his death.

In July the watchdog passed a file of evidence to prosecutors concerning three constables and a community support officer.

In total the IPCC has investigated five constables, three sergeants, two inspectors, one community support officer, five call handlers and two control room dispatch staff.

IPCC commissioner Jan Williams said: 'As part of this inquiry, our investigators criminally interviewed six Avon and Somerset Police officers and staff and I decided that files for all these individuals should go to the Crown Prosecution Service to determine whether they should face criminal charges.

'In total, 18 police officers and staff members who had some involvement in the force's dealings with Mr Ebrahimi in the days leading up to his brutal murder have been investigated.

'I have provided the acting chief constable with a report detailing our findings as to whether or not those individuals have a case to answer for either misconduct or gross misconduct and should face disciplinary proceedings.

'Until the conclusion of potential criminal matters, it would not be appropriate to release further detail.'

The watchdog said it was also looking at historic police contact with Mr Ebrahimi dating back six years before his death.

Acting chief constable John Long said: 'The murder of Bijan Ebrahimi was a needless and dreadful tragedy.

'We believed from an early stage that we failed in our duty to protect him, and the report confirms that.

'My thoughts and feelings at this moment are with the family and friends of Mr Ebrahimi. I am deeply sorry that we did not do enough to prevent his death.

'I am grateful for the thoroughness of the IPCC report. My intention now is to address the matters of misconduct, the service failure that took place and the lessons to be learnt in a prompt, firm and direct manner.

'Whilst the pain of the family can never be diminished, we will act as quickly as we can to do what we must do.

'Until the CPS have made their decisions and the disciplinary processes reach a conclusion, we cannot comment further on the detail of the IPCC report, but I want to reassure the communities of Avon and Somerset that we are treating the findings with utmost seriousness and will continue to improve the way we work to protect the public and keep them safe.'
