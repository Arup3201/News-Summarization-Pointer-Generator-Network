Manchester United's executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward says Louis van Gaal is underlining why he was the perfect choice to become the club's new manager.

In an exclusive interview with MUTV, Woodward explained how he admires Van Gaal's direct approach while noting his warmth as a person.

'He's got incredible energy and very importantly he likes attacking football,' explained Woodward.

'If you remember the Barcelona team [he managed] in the late '90s, who played incredible, attacking football, and those games we had against them in '98/99, that’s the kind of football Manchester United fans love. It’s part of our DNA.

'The second part of what he likes is giving youth a chance. He’s got a track record littered with giving young players a break in the first team, who have gone on to be stars.

'Clearly that’s Manchester United’s philosophy and we want him to continue with that.

'I’ve personally found him very warm. He’s a very clear communicator and very direct. I like that in people; I’m a very direct person myself. He’s a stickler for planning and that’s something we as a club do very well. We plan everything in a lot of detail and that’s going to be a good fit.

'We’ve got someone who has confidence in himself about making difficult decisions and, when you boil down what makes a great manager, one of the key characteristics is making difficult decisions and we’ve clearly got a manager who can do that.

'I’m hearing a lot of good feedback from a lot of people about him and there is a huge amount of goodwill towards him and the coaching staff,' added Woodward. 'Every interaction he’s having with people is leaving an imprint, which is superb.'

The executive vice-chairman also spoke of the importance of having Ryan Giggs involved in Van Gaal's regime.

'It was a very easy conversation to have [with Louis] about Ryan. He said he wanted Ryan to be in his group," said Woodward.

'It’s very important to us as a club that we have continuity and Ryan is the perfect person to continue that continuity. He did a great job in the set-up last year and has obviously been at the club for a long time, so we’re very pleased about that.

'There is real unity in the squad and Louis clearly has something to give in terms of the special way he has with his players when it comes to binding the team together.

'We’ve seen that already with the steps he’s taken with the preparation and the training and the things going on around that. He’s going to deliver exactly what we expect him to deliver and in conjunction with Ryan, who has that great understanding of all these players.'
