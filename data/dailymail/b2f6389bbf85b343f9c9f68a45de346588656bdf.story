She’s been hitting the gym lately, toning her already impressive physique.

And it looks like all the hard work is paying off for Melanie Sykes, who graces the cover of Fabulous this week looking in the best shape of her life.

On the cover of the new issue, on sale Sunday July 6, Mel, 43, wears a white crop top showing off her killer abs and enviably toned arms.

Her long brown hair looks healthy and glossy and is swept to the side. Mel’s makeup is minimal, and the presenter looks fresh-faced and youthful.

In another shot, the presenter is seen resting her hands over the side of a brilliant blue swimming pool, wearing aviator sunglasses with her hair swept back.

And it would seem that, despite the end of her second marriage - to Jack Cockings - Mel is happy being single and in no rush to tie the knot any time soon, if ever.

‘I’ve got my kids, girlfriends and a great life,' she tells the magazine. 'I’m not hankering for a relationship.

‘I’ll never marry again. But I said that the first time, so…’

Mel's first marriage was to actor Daniel Caltagirone, who is the father of their children, Roman, 12, and Valentino, 10.

They divorced in 2009 and three years later, Melanie and Jack started exchanging tweets.

The pair raised eyebrows with their sexually charged and very public messages over Twitter.

Their relationship moved at lightening speed, with Mel and Jack marrying in May 2013. But the relationship came to an end almost as quickly as it had started.

The pair split up in December 2013, after just seven months of marriage.

Mel also opens up to Fabulous about her youngest son Valentino - Tino - who was diagnosed with autism at the age of two.

‘I had to get some focus and learn how to be strong and happy in order to help him,' she says.

'Tino has no grey areas and is very straight talking, and I like that about him. I’ve 100 per cent learned from him.’  

On being too old for TV, Mel says: ‘If women feel that they’ve been dismissed unfairly then that’s their battle to be had.

'I personally don’t want to be on television when I’m in my 60s anyway. I’d rather have a great radio show and swan about having a fabulous life, thank you very much.’

Melanie kicked off her television career on The Big Breakfast, going on to host Today with Des and Mel, with Des O'Connor in 2003, Let's Do Lunch with Gino and Mel in 2011 and, most recently, was a presenter on BT Sport’s Moto GP, though left abruptly after only a few shows.

The full exclusive interview appears in Fabulous magazine, out only in this weekend’s edition of the Sun on Sunday on 6 July. Fabulous magazine is free in The Sun on Sunday every week.
