The Brooklyn father who fatally beat 7-year-old Nixzmary Brown also forced his son to rape a relative, according to reports.

The new allegations were laid out on Wednesday against Cesar Rodriguez, who was convicted in the 2006 torture and killing of Nixzmary, in a case that shocked New York and forced a major shake up of the city's child protection agency.

Rodriguez's now 15-year-old stepson, who has been charged with raping two relatives some eight years ago, told detectives that his stepfather forced him to commit at least one of the crimes, the New York Daily News reported.

The father made the boy commit the act while he watched, sources told the New York Post.

The alleged rape would have happened before his sister's murder in 2006, when he was about 8 years old.

Victim: Nixzmary Brown, then 7, was fatally beaten by her father after he accused her of eating his yogurt. Her mother, who had often abused the child herself, did nothing while Nixzmary was killed in 2006

MURDER: Nixzmary Brown's parents, Cesar Rodriguez and Nixzaliz Santiago, are both serving prison sentences for bounding and beating the 7-year-old girl. The mother did nothing while Rodriguez dealt the final blow

The teen, who now lives with an adoptive family in the Bronx, is charged with rape and endangering the welfare of a minor, The Post reported.

Police say that the boy and Nixzmary lived in a house of horrors in Brooklyn and were subjected to starvation and frequent beatings, often involving a thick leather belt.

She was also bound frequently and left in a rat-infested room where she was forced to use the cat litter as a toilet.

Nixzmary's murder led to reforms at the Administration for Children's Services when it was revealed that case workers had received reports of abuse before but did nothing to stop the girl's parents

The day of her brutal murder in 2006, Rodriguez became enraged because the child had eaten one of his yogurts.

The mother, Nixzaliz Santiago, had been a frequent witness to the beatings and often partook in dealing blows, but did nothing to stop Rodriguez as he savagely beat the 7-year-old girl.

They were both charged with manslaughter and convicted of in her death.

Rodriguez, who dealt the deathly blow, was sentenced to 29 years in prison.

The mother, who had previously been convicted of beating the child, was sentenced to a stiffer sentence that could keep her behind bars for up to 43 years.

Nixzmary's death shocked the nation and led to an overhaul of the city's Administration for Children's Service.

The agency's case workers had received numerous reports of mistreatment in the family but failed to act.
