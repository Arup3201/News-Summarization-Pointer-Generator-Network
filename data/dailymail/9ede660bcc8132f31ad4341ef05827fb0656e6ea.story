Baltimore County Police say two students who were shooting ducks and geese near Stevenson University were the cause of a report that triggered a campus lockdown.

The department said on its official Twitter feed late Monday that no charges will be filed in the incident.

University President Kevin J. Manning said in an emailed statement that the two students were hunting with BB guns in the woods near campus.

Police say the investigation began about 2.25pm on Monday when two people saw what they thought was a person with a gun and called 911.

The university ordered the Owings Mills campus on lockdown as tactical teams searched the area.

A suspicious pick-up truck
 containing a rifle with a scope was recovered after the vehicle came on
 to campus using a parking pass, SkyTeam 11 Captain Roy Taylor told WBAL.

The lockdown was lifted shortly after 5pm, but classes and other evening activities on the campus in rural Maryland were cancelled.

'We are proud of the response of our security staff, students and others
 in acting quickly and cooperatively with our campus alerts,' Manning said in a statement to the Baltimore Sun. 'While we are relieved with this safe outcome, this has been a sobering 
experience for us and our families. This reminds us all of the 
importance of our "see something, say something" mantra.'

Nyah Reese, 19, told the Baltimore Sun that she and classmates huddled in the corner of a 
classroom until officers told them the area was safe.

'I saw some kids crying,' she said, adding that she remained calm. 'I was a little scared.'

The private university has around 4,000 students spread over two campuses.

Tactical teams searched the school for about three hours before giving an all clear. Some students said they were terrified during the lockdown
