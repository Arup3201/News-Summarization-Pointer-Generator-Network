Arguably the player of the tournament before kick-off, Arjen Robben's World Cup ended with a poor display in Sao Paulo, as he was thwarted at every turn by Javier Mascherano.

The Bayern Munich winger was Holland's standout performer in the group stage, scoring three times in three games to send Louis Van Gaal's side through as group winners - but he failed to have an impact on proceedings at the Corinthians Arena, with Argentina going through to the final on penalties.

Below, Sportsmail takes a look at how Robben fared against a steely Argentine defence...

Vital touch: An aerial view of Mascherano's tackle on Robben in the 90th minute

Cross-hairs: Whenever Robben got the ball against Argentina, Mascherano was there hassling him

Louis' main man: Robben walks past his coach in the warm-up before kick-off

6mins – Pablo Zabaleta snuffs out the first Robben threat as the Dutch winger tries to drive into the box on the left and flick a cross towards Robin van Persie in the centre.

Seconds later he controls a great lofted ball by Dirk Kuyt but the flag is up and play is brought back.

12mins – Mascherano dispossesses Robben with a smart sliding tackle on the right, but the ball falls straight to the feet of Wesley Sneijder, who smashes a shot wide from 25 yards.

Block: The Dutchman creates a yard for himself but Pablo Zabaleta recovers well to stop his cross

Swamped: Argentina's defenders crowded Robben out whenever the ball went near him

Not happy: Van Gaal had a couple of angry exchanges with his star player during the match

A rare touch: Robben touched the ball just six times in the opening 45 minutes, two of which were throw-ins

HALF-TIME: HOLLAND 0-0 ARGENTINA

Robben touched the ball just six times in the first half - the Holland goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen had 20 touches - and also made just one successful pass.

If that wasn’t bad enough, two of his touches were to take throw-ins on the right-hand side and another was after receiving the ball back from a team-mate from one of those throws.

Needless to say, his impact in the opening 45 minutes was minimal, as the likes of Javier Mascherano and Pablo Zabaleta stuck close to him and nipped in front to steal the ball before it ever reached him.

49mins–
 The speedy attacker wins a free-kick for Holland after controlling the ball with his back to goal and 
being pulled back by Martin Demichelis. The Argentina picked up a yellow
 card for the foul on his former Bayern Munich team-mate.

54mins –
 Had as many touches in one dribble as he did in the whole of the first 
half, sprinting at the heart of the Argentina defence before losing 
control of the ball.

Foul: Robben's former Bayern team-mate Demichelis is booked for pulling the Dutchman back

Rival: Messi saw far more of the ball in the first half than his opponent Robben

On the ball: Robben started to demand the ball from his team-mates in the second half

66mins - Takes a pass from Daryl Janmaat in his stride on the right but his progress is slowed by Rojo. Robben cuts inside and holds the ball up so his team-mates can catch up with him, before sweeping a pass out to Wesley Sneijder on the left.

74mins - The Bayern winger is resorting to drifting from one side of the pitch to the other in search of the ball. Unfortunately for him, a number of passes towards him have been wildly overhit.

75mins - Flicks a pass into the path of the overlapping Daley Blind, who whips a cross into the box that Robin van Persie is unable to acrobatically direct towards goal.

Help me: Robben made some decent runs in the second half but his team-mates failed to find him

83mins - Whips his first cross of the evening straight down Sergio Romero's throat.

86mins - Demichelis prods the ball off Robben's toes as the Dutch attacker tries to cause some damage on the left with minutes left on the clock.

90mins - The best chance of the game falls to Robben as the clock ticks into added time. Sneijder flicks the ball to his side on the edge of the Argentina box and Robben steams past and takes it with him.

His next touch takes him wide of Romero's goal but he is still able to get a shot away - only for Mascherano to throw himself in front of the strike and put the ball behind.

Through on goal: Robben bursts into the box and sends a shot goalwards with his left foot

Brilliant block: Mascherano thwarts Robben by diving in front of the Dutchman's shot

Big chance: Robben puts his hands to his head after his shot is blocked by Mascherano in the 90th minute

END OF NORMAL TIME: HOLLAND 0-0 ARGENTINA - After an unusually quiet 89 minutes from Robben he had a glorious opportunity to win the game. What stood in his way was Javier Mascherano, just as he had done all night. The Argentina midfielder threw his body in front of Robben's shot, which ensured normal time ended goalless.

96mins - Takes the captain's armband from the departying van Persie and immediately produces a flash of brilliance, dinking the ball between Demichelis and Zabaleta, somehow following it through the gap and then winning a corner off the legs of Mascherano.

Argentine sandwich: Robben retrieves the ball after slipping it between Zabaleta and Demichelis

99mins - Thumps a fizzing shot at goal that Romero gratefully gathers in his arms. If Robben's strike had nicked off one of the Argentina defenders on its way to goal it could have caused seriously problems for the goalkeeper.

Close eye: Robben found it very difficult to evade the attention of Mascherano

Passes - 36

Duels won - 5/17

Aerial duels won - 0/3

Successful crosses - 0

Chances created - 0

Shots on target - 1

Distance covered - 13.5km

119mins - Robben controls a curling pass superbly on the left and tries to jink into the box, but again Mascherano is there to stop him in his tracks and hammer the ball away from danger.

PENALTY SHOOT-OUT: Took Holland's second penalty and showed no nerves whatsoever as he waited for Romero to dive before firing his spot-kick into the bottom right corner.

Robben's involvement in the tournament ended  as Argentina won the shootout 4-2 thanks to  Romero. The Monaco shotstopper made two great saves from Vlaar and Sneijder to knock Van Gaal's side out and seal a place in the final.

No end product: Robben was involved in attacking areas but failed to create chances for his team-mates
