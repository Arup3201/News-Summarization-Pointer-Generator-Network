To celebrate reaching a million followers on Twitter, the New England Patriots' social media team decided to start an online campaign.

They asked fans to retweet their message marking the milestone, and in return their name would be put on the back of a 'digital custom jersey'.

However the plan backfired, and they ended up sharing a nasty racial slur.

Blunder: The Patriots' social media team asked fans to retweet their message marking the milestone, and in return their name would be put on the back of a 'digital custom jersey'. However they shared a racial slur 

The post, uploaded from the account @IHATEN******, ended up on the site on the back of the 'digital custom jersey' and was accompanied by a message saying 'thank you for helping us become the first NFL team with 1 million followers'.

The racist tweet was on their account for an hour, until the mistake was realized and it was taken down.

However it had already gone viral and had been noticed by many social media users who shared the error. 

An apology from the team followed. It read: 'We apologize for the regrettable tweet that went out from our account. Our filtering system failed & we will be more vigilant in the future.' 

A number of people reacted to the tweet with jokes. One user posted a picture of a bin on fire, saying it was outside the franchise's headquarters while another said whoever ran the account would have been fired. 

One said that the regrettable tweet may have even gained them followers.  

Confession: The post was taken down an hour after it was uploaded, prompting the social media team to apologize to their followers 

Reaction: One twitter user said the consequences of the regrettable tweet could have faced dire consequences as a result 

Slur: Another speculated that more people would have followed the account in the wake of the message 

Mocking: Jason Sparks jokingly posted a picture of a bin on fire, saying it was outside the Patriots' front office
