Pudding the fox has abandoned the call of the wild and has almost become a pet at a rescue centre in Northamptonshire. 

The three-year-old vixen was abandoned by its mother in Yorkshire and has become so tame that that it can never be released into the wild. 

Instead, she has become a fixture at the National Fox Welfare Society in Rushden, Northamptonshire.

Mark Hemmington of the NFWS said he had intended releasing Pudding into the wild but she bonded with him

After appearing on the society's Facebook page, Pudding's legend has even managed to cross the Atlantic ocean. 

Speaking to ABC News, Mark Hemmington of the NFWS said: 'Pudding came to us from Yorkshire, hence the name Pudding. She was found on her own at a very young age.'

Mr Hemmington said the original plan was to try and release pudding into the wild by integrating her with a litter of cubs and get her accustomed to foraging for food. 

But instead, the fox prefers human companionship and all efforts to convince her to move out failed. 

A large tree fell, which prevented Pudding meeting the other fox cubs at a vital time in her development. 

Pudding has even appeared on television in the United States and has a growing legion of fans on Facebook 

Despite his success in taming Pudding, Mr Hemmington said the best place for foxes is the wild 

He added: 'Pudding had no cubs to integrate with and bonded more with me.'

However Mr Hemmington does not advise other people to try and tame a fox as 'they are wild animals and that is where I believe they should be'.

The NFWS is a voluntary organisation which has been rescuing injured and sick foxes for more than 20 years. 

They also help treat foxes suffering from Sarcoptic Mange.
