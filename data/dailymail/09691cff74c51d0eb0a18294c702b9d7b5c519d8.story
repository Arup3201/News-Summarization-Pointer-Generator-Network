In the the dead of night, the Halifax bomber crew were heading for home after a successful mission over Germany.

Suddenly the plane burst into flames as it came under enemy fire and the crew were forced to bail out, parachuting into a field, only to be captured by the German soldiers waiting below.

The Canadian pilot, Jim Watson, and his British wireless operator, Richard Yates, spent the final three years of the Second World War as prisoners.

The veterans remained friends over the years and should have been able to stand side by side once again at the unveiling of a £6.5 million Bomber Command Memorial in London on June 28.

Although Mr Watson, 91, is being flown over for the event by the Canadian government, his old comrade, who lives just outside the capital in Surrey, has been unable to get a ticket and cannot attend.

Mr Yates, 90, is one of a growing number of Bomber Command veterans who are angry about missing out on the grand unveiling ceremony in Green Park because no more tickets are available.

On Monday the Daily Mail revealed how 91-year-old Freddie Johnson, who flew 92 missions as a rear gunner, had been told there were no tickets available for him to attend the ceremony.

Then yesterday the family of former navigator Tom Bennett, 93, a decorated member of the Dambusters squadron, said they have been trying for months to get a ticket for him but have had no response to emails and a letter.

Despite helping to raise funds for the memorial and being a member of the Bomber Command Association, Mr Yates said he didn’t know about the ceremony or the need to apply for tickets until it was too late.

By contrast Mr Watson, a retired chemical engineer, and 24 other Canadian veterans (each accompanied by a carer) are having their return transatlantic flights and their accommodation paid for by their government and arrangements have been made for them to attend the ceremony during the four-day trip.

‘The last time they paid for me to fly across the Atlantic to England I got into a bit of a mess and that was 1941,’ said Mr Watson from his home in Quebec.

‘It’s wonderful what the Canadian government is doing and I was very surprised when Dickie told me he couldn’t go. I thought he would have known all about it.’

The two men plan to meet anyway, but Mr Yates’s family feel the efforts made to fly veterans from across the world to the ceremony is ‘rubbing salt into the wounds’ of the British servicemen who are missing out.

His son Roland Yates, 61, a building surveyor, said: ‘I think the Government over here should have helped out to make sure all the veterans who fought in Bomber Command could go.

'My father had no idea this was happening or how the tickets were being allocated until we read about it in the Daily Mail.

‘We feel he has been let down. He is very proud of his war years and we feel sorry for him.’

Mr Yates was based at Linton-on-Ouse, North Yorkshire, during the war and flew 15 missions before being shot down over Belgium on June 9,1942.

The entire seven-man crew safely parachuted to the ground but were quickly rounded up by German soldiers.

He served out the war in several POW camps before being liberated by Allied forces while he and his fellow prisoners were on a forced march.

Mr Yates, who was promoted to warrant officer while in captivity, married in 1945, became a father of two and worked as a tax officer. He is now a great-grandfather living in a retirement home in Farnham, Surrey.

When his wife Rita died in 2000, his former pilot, Mr Watson, invited him to Canada to visit and come to terms with his loss.

Mr Yates said he received information 
in the post about the memorial fundraising last year but was not aware 
veterans had to apply for tickets. He said: ‘I would have liked to have 
received an invitation to the unveiling ceremony, but it’s not to be.’

The memorial in Green Park will honour the 55,573 bomber crew who lost their lives

Within hours of the Daily Mail article about Mr Johnson, from Tadcaster,
North Yorkshire, his family received a call from Royal Air Force 
organisers to tell them that two tickets would be provided after all.

However, Mr Bennett, who survived dozens of dangerous missions, has not so far received an offer of tickets.

Mr
Bennett, of Chiselhurst, Kent, joined 49 Squadron at the outbreak of 
war and was a navigator on Lancaster bombers before transferring to the 
617 Dambusters Squadron after the raid on the German dams.

The
Queen is expected to unveil the £6.5million memorial to the 55,573 
bomber crew who lost their lives and 6,500 people have been allocated 
tickets. Other members of the Royal Family will attend.

A spokesman for the RAF said the 
Ministry of Defence has had no involvement in the arrangements for the 
unveiling, apart from supporting the event and being available for 
‘advice’. He denied the MoD could have made a difference.

‘The
Bomber Command team have done a fantastic job,’ he said. ‘They have put
out a lot of information to inform people what was going on. 
Unfortunately not everybody reads newspapers and some have found out 
very late indeed.’

There will be around 100 dignitaries at the event, but the RAF spokesman said the Defence Secretary would be the only minister there to ensure as many veterans as possible could attend.

● A massive memorial commemorating the deaths of all 1.7million servicemen and women who died in the First and Second World Wars is planned to open on the 100th anniversary of the start of the Great War in August 2014.

Plans have been submitted to the local council to build a £17million memorial of 12 giant white granite walls on the White Cliffs of Dover listing all their names.
