There's nothing better than receiving a compliment and nearly half of all Brits believe that a positive comment about how they look would lift them out of any mood they were in.

According to the latest study, top of the compliments list is being told you look younger than you are, which put a smile on 43.3 per cent of peoples’ faces.

Other day-changing comments were being told your hair looks nice, being praised by peers, and even getting a cheeky wolf whistle from passers-by.

Being asked if you had lost weight and being told that your children were well-behaved were also amongst the top ten confidence boosters.

People also counted being told you resemble a celebrity, as well as neighbours complimenting your garden as big confidence boosters.

The city with inhabitants most likely to give over 10 compliments a month to people they know was Liverpool, reinforcing the claim that Northerners are more friendly, closely followed by Belfast and Plymouth.

Despite all this, giving out compliments is actually a rare feat for most Brits, with one sixth of adults stating that they never give compliments to people they know and 48.6 per cent claiming the same with regards to strangers.

The most Scrooge-like city with their compliments was Cardiff, with a good fifth of the Welsh capital's people ranking low amongst those who offer people they know praise or admiration and this was closely followed by Glasgow and Manchester.

It was also found that only one fifth of all respondents give out 10-20 compliments a month to friends, family and colleagues, with a mere 5 per cent taking the time to offer words of praise to strangers.

A spokesperson for Transform Cosmetic Surgery who are launching the National Feel Good Campaign on Friday, said: 'The research has brought to light just how important it is to compliment each other and ultimately spread positive thoughts and feelings.

'We should spend more time telling our loved ones and peers how great they’re looking and even praising them for great work or simply looking up to smile at a stranger.'
