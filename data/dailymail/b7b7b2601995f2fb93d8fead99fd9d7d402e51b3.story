She's widely touted as one of the most naturally beautiful women in Hollywood, and now the secret behind Jessica Alba's flawless complexion has been revealed.

The actress, 33, has been unveiled as the face of the Braun Face - and epilator that doubles as a deep-pore cleansing brush - and she credits the gadget for giving her glowing skin.

Speaking about the £69.99 product, Jessica said: 'It doesn't matter whether you're going for a red carpet look, or want a day without any make-up on; we need to be able to count on beautifully cleansed skin as our foundation.

'Braun Face gives women the confidence and freedom to either wear make-up or not.'

Flawless: Jessica Alba, 33, has been unveiled as the face of the Braun Face - and epilator that doubles as a deep-pore cleansing brush - and credits the gadget for giving her that famous dewy glow (she is the ambassador, though!)

The makers claim that the sonic cleansing technology gently but thoroughly sweeps away make-up, pollution and impurities while preparing the skin to absorb beauty products more efficiently.

In the flick of a switch, it transforms into a facial epilator to remove hairs on the eyebrows, upper lip and chin. 

Jessica has been working with the beauty giant since March this year and the stylish mother-of-two is the perfect advert for the healthy lifestyle she advocates in the accompanying imagery. 

Speaking about their choice, a spokesperson for the beauty brand said at the time: 'Jessica Alba is a strong, passionate woman and an advocate for others - she is the perfect ambassador to talk about the role beauty and our products play in helping women to feel their best. 

'Braun admires her for her principles, her talents and her ability to juggle a demanding acting career with being a great mum.'

Jessica's acting career began at the tender age of 12. After studying at the Atlantic Theatre, she went on to star in James Cameron’s Dark Angel, gaining worldwide recognition.

She has since made over 25 feature films such as The Fantastic Four and Sin City.

The actress - who has emerged as a stylish role model for working mothers with her all-natural baby product line, Honest - has two children - Honor Marie, age five, and Haven Garner, age two - with her husband, Cash Warren.  

Only two years after its launch, the entrepreneur is set to float her eco-friendly nappy business, The Honest Company, and cash in on its valuation.

This year, the annual revenue of her business is expected to be more than $150m (£93m), three times the annual revenue in 2013. So no wonder the savvy star has decided that now is the time to cash-in.

She set up the company in 2012 with Christopher Gavigan - the former CEO of Healthy Child Healthy World.

They started with a line of 'non-toxic' nappies featuring appealing prints and other 'natural' baby products, before adding bath, body and house-cleaning supplies.

Jessica has previously spoken about dividing her time between her family, acting and The Honest Co.

'It's an imperfect balance and I am not sure if I do it very well. I spend most of my time at the office, but my kids' health and wellbeing is my priority. I talk to my [business] partners about my responsibility with my children,' she said recently speaking to Fortune.

'I have worked around board meetings and conferences. With email, I am still involved in the process of design and it is easy to share files with Dropbox. I can still work on product development that way.'

Forget soap and water - these days, women are ditching flannels in favour of electric face brushes to help give skin a super-deep clean. First on the scene, in 2009, was the £150 Clarisonic, but since then the market has exploded.

Now, every major skincare brand, from Boots' No7 to Mary Kay, has their own. Last month, budget store Lidl announced a £9.99 version - including a year's worth of replacement heads (most manufacturers suggest replacing heads every three months, or when bristles become worn).

While features vary, broadly speaking, there are two technologies: vibrating and rotating. There's no independent research to suggest one technology is superior, and most experts agree that, in general, all face brushes can be good for skin.

'Face brushes make a ritual of cleansing, which can mean women are more likely to cleanse thoroughly,' says Dr Sam Bunting, a Harley Street cosmetic dermatologist. 'Used correctly, they can help remove more surface dirt than manual cleansing, meaning the products you use penetrate better.'

Devotees claim they leave skin more toned and radiant, but Dr Bunting warns they need to be used with care: 'There is the potential for over-cleansing, damaging the skin, and they can even cause breakouts. It's about using it when your skin needs it, with an appropriate cleanser, such as Cetaphil, that won't over-dry your skin.'
