A couple today admitted child cruelty after being accused of keeping their young son a ‘prisoner in his bedroom’.

The 50-year-old man and his 38-year-old wife each admitted a charge of wilfully assaulting, ill-treating, neglecting, abandoning or exposing the boy in a manner likely to cause him unnecessary suffering or injury to health between November 2007 and November 2012.

The couple, from Paignton, Devon, submitted a basis of plea (pleading guilty but only on a certain set of facts) which was not accepted by the prosecution but the judge said it would make no difference to their eventual sentence next month at Exeter Crown Court.

At an earlier hearing before magistrates, prosecutor Philip Sewell claimed the boy, now aged 11, was locked in his bedroom for ‘long periods of time’ and not allowed out.

He said: “He was sometimes unable to do anything other than relieve himself there. Sometimes a bucket was provided.”

The lower court heard the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, told a schoolteacher he had wet himself and was asked why.

Neighbours and other family members had ‘concerns’ about the boy.

Mr Sewell said the boy was also locked out of the house for ‘long periods of time’ without being suitably dressed and was taken in by other people.

He said: “He was out in light clothing in the rain.”

After the hearing Det Con Samantha Vignaux, who investigated the case, said: “He would be left out during the summer holidays in all weathers and would knock on neighbours’ doors to ask if children would come out to play.

“Neighbours were unable to raise anybody at the house because they had gone out for the day.

“It would be pouring with rain and the neighbours would give him clothes to wear.

“On one occasion he was seen urinating in a neighbour’s garden because he couldn’t get in the house.

“It is just a very sad case involving a young man and people who were supposed to take care of him but didn’t.”

The child is now being cared for properly and the detective said: “He is the nicest little chap you would ever want to meet.

“Nobody has a bad word to say about this little man. He has fantastic people looking after him now who are doing a proper parenting job and put his needs first.

“It went on for so long because he didn’t tell anybody. It is a very sad story involving a delightful young man.”
