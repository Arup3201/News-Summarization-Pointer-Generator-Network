Promoting marriage: Iain Duncan Smith and his wife Betsy

Iain Duncan Smith last night signalled support for a major campaign to promote marriage and turn back the ‘appalling’ tide of divorce.

The Work and Pensions Secretary, widely seen as the social conscience of the modern Conservative Party, indicated he was wholeheartedly behind a bid by High Court judge Sir Paul Coleridge to end the ‘destructive scourge’ of family breakdown.

Sir Paul will formally launch the Marriage Foundation today in a bid to raise awareness of the vital role of marriage in bringing up children.

The senior family court judge said he felt compelled to speak out because of the unprecedented scale of the problem.

He added: ‘I happen to think that the family judiciary have a contribution to make to this debate. Most of us have watched as the situation has gradually got more and more and more appalling and out of control and there comes a time when it is, I think, irresponsible to remain quiet.

‘This is now happening across Britain – and indeed Europe and North America – on a scale we have never seen before and the impact it has on the whole of society is very, very real and dramatic and we need to highlight it and do something about it.’

The initiative received a mixed reaction at Westminster yesterday. Mr Duncan Smith, whose social justice strategy paper earlier this year underlined the importance of marriage, indicated his support.

A source close to Mr Duncan Smith, who has been married to Betsy for 30 years, said: ‘He thinks it is a great campaign – it has his wholehearted support.’

But the Labour leadership responded coolly. Ed Miliband, who married 11 months ago, said he did not think politicians should be ‘judgmental’ on the question of whether people get married.

And former Labour children’s secretary Ed Balls said that he and his wife Yvette Cooper – who wed 14 years ago – believed marriage was ‘a better way forward for our children’, but warned: ‘Not everyone in a marriage has a good time.’

High Court judge Sir Paul Coleridge said family breakdown is 'destructive'

Speaking at a press conference in London, he said: ‘What I’m not going to do is become moral or judgmental about people who aren’t married.’

Launching the Marriage Foundation in London tonight, Sir Paul will stress he is ‘not courting politicians’, saying they ‘did not create the current epidemic’ of divorce.

But he adds: ‘If we are going to improve things, we need consistency of approach and for many years to come. On this issue the record of politicians and political parties is simply not reliable.’

The organisation will instead seek to set out the facts about the impact of family breakdown on children’s prospects and provide practical support for couples.

It already has the backing of a string of senior family lawyers, including former president of the family division Baroness Butler-Sloss and divorce lawyer Baroness Shackleton, who represented Prince Charles and Sir Paul McCartney.

Other high-profile backers include the Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks and the Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu.

Research by the Centre for Social Justice think-tank found that 26 per cent of cohabiting parents had split up by the time their first child reached the age of five, compared with only 9 per cent of married parents.

Another study has estimated the total cost of family breakdown to society at £44billion a year.

Sir Paul yesterday accused celebrity magazines such as Hello! of promoting unrealistic expectations of marriage.

He added: ‘We all know, all of us who have been in relationships – whether married or unmarried – for a long time is that the only way that they are made to work and the only way that they become really qualitatively good is by absolutely grinding away at it.

‘That’s when people find that, actually, if they get through the difficulties and do get the help, they will in fact end up with a product that is really worth having.’
