Arm bone fragments from a 1.34-million-year-old hominin, Paranthropus boisei, were discovered by an international research team

A human ancestor that was characterised by a 'robust' jaw and skull bones was also a muscular creature that had a gorilla-like upper body.

Bones have revealed that one of our ancient ancestor was more adaptive to its environment than previously thought.

Researchers found the partial skeleton -- including arm, hand, leg and foot fragments -- dating back 1.34 million years at at the Olduvai Gorge World Heritage fossil site in Tanzania.

The skeleton belonged to a Paranthropus boisei hominid which lived across Africa side-by-side with direct ancestors of humans.

Researchers believe the creature stood 3.5 to 4.5 feet tall, was very strong and had a robust frame.

The find, published in PLOS ONE, represents one of the most recent occurrences of Paranthropus boisei before its extinction in East Africa.

'This is the first time we've found bones that suggest that this creature was more ruggedly built - combining terrestrial bipedal locomotion and some arboreal behaviours - than we'd previously thought,' said Charles Musiba, associate professor of anthropology at the University of Colorado Denver.

'It seems to have more well-formed forearm muscles that were used for climbing, fine-manipulation and all sorts of behaviour.'

Paranthropus boisei was a long-lived species of archaic hominin that first evolved in East Africa about 2.3 million years ago

The skeleton belonged to a Paranthropus boisei hominid which lived across Africa side-by-side with direct ancestors of humans.

Paranthropus boisei was a long-lived species of archaic hominin that first evolved in East Africa about 2.3 million years ago.

The species
 was part of a line of close human relatives known as australopithecines
 that includes the famous three million-year-old Ethiopian fossil Lucy, 
seen by some as the matriarch of modern humans.

Roughly
 2.3 million years ago, the australopithecines are thought to have split
 into the genus Homo - which produced modern Homo sapiens - and the 
genus Paranthropus, that dead-ended.

Researchers believe the creature stood 3.5 to 4.5 feet tall, was very strong and had a robust frame. The size of the arm bones suggests strong forearms and a powerful upper body.

'We know that it was very strong,' Professor Musiba said. 'It's unprecedented to find how strong this individual was. The stronger you are the more adaptive you are.'

Mary Leakey discovered the first skull of Paranthropus boisei in 1959 in northern Tanzania.

While Paranthropus boisei was known for its massive jaws and cranium, the build of the rest of the ancient hominin's body has been unknown until recently.

During excavations at Olduvai in 2010-2011, the team discovered the partial skeleton of a large adult individual who is represented by various teeth and skeletal parts.

Earlier analysis of the species teeth had given researchers clues about the kind of food it ate. They believe it was omnivorous, leaning more toward plant material

Roughly 2.3 million years ago, the australopithecines are thought to have split into the genus Homo - which produced modern Homo sapiens - and the genus Paranthropus, that dead-ended.

In the absence of evidence of other skeletal remains, it was commonly assumed that the skeleton of Paranthropus boisei was like that of more ancient species of the genus Australopithecus.

'We are starting to understand the physiology of these individuals of this particular species and how it actually adapted to the kind of habitat it lived in,' Professor Musiba said.

'We knew about the kind of food it ate -- it was omnivorous, leaning more toward plant material -- but now we know more: how it walked around and now we know it was a tree climber.'

The size of the arm bones suggests strong forearms and a powerful upper body.

'It's a different branch on our ancestry tree,' Professor  Musiba said. 'It came later than the other hominins, so the question now is "what happened to it?" We're going to do more work on biomechanics and see what else this creature was doing.'

In summer 2014, the bones will be displayed as part of a large exhibit on human origins in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.

The joint-museum exhibit involves the Museum of Human Evolution in Burgos, Spain, the Regional Museum of Archaeology in Madrid, and the National Museum of Dar es Salaam.

With each find scientists are adding to the understanding of how humans evolved and adapted to their surroundings through time. 'The more we are finding of these fossils, the more we are learning about the history of these species,' said Professor Musiba.
