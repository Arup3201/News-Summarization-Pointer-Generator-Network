'Sent angry texts': Simon Gittany arrives at court with his new girlfriend during his trial for the murder of his fiancee Lisa Harnum

The man accused of throwing his ballerina fiancée to her death from their high-rise apartment in Sydney sent her text messages pleading with her not to look at other men, a court heard today.

'Please don’t let any guy talk to you or please don’t look at any guy as your eyes should gaze on me, the one,’ said one of texts read out in the New South Wales Supreme Court where 40-year-old Simon Gittany has denied murdering 30-year-old Lisa Harnum.

Asked by a prosecutor to comment on the text, Gittany said: ‘I was being cute.’

The court heard of a second text to Canadian Miss Harnum in which he wrote: ‘Who the f*** do you think you are walking around the house like you own it or coming and going without my permission?

‘You walk around like a peacock with your hair out.’

Gittany told prosecutor Mark Tedeschi that he and Miss Harnum had been arguing for two days at the time the text was sent.

‘I was angry and I shouldn’t have sent that message,’ he said.

The texts were revealed to the court after Gittany had demonstrated how he tried to save his fiancée from plunging to her death from the balcony of their 15th floor luxury apartment.

Holding both arms outstretched, with his palms down, he said one of his legs was resting on the handle grip of a treadmill as he tried to reach Miss Harnum who was on the awning of the unit - a wooden structure protruding from the actual balcony.

Mr Tedeschi asked Gittany if he had used his ‘superior strength as a male to commit a serious act of aggression’ when he dragged Miss Harnum back into their unit on the morning.

‘Yes, I agree,’ Gittany replied, but added that he had not intended to be aggressive.

The prosecutor asked what had happened in the 69 seconds between Miss Harnum being pulled back into unit 1503 and the time she fell to her death on that morning of July 30, 2011.

‘I suggest that you threw her off the balcony while she was still wearing the handbag she had been wearing in the hall (at the time she tried to leave).’

‘No,’ Gittany said.

'69 seconds after you committed this act of aggression, Lisa Harnum was dead,’ said Mr Tedeschi.

‘Yes.’

‘Did you threaten her with death prior to her running out of the apartment?’

‘No.’

The prosecutor asked Gittany if he was ‘apoplectic’ when he found out Miss Harnum was leaving him and that she had given clothes to her personal trainer, Lisa Brown.

Struggle: The prosecutor asked Gittany if he had used his 'superior strength as a male to commit a serious act of aggression' when he dragged Miss Harnum back into their unit before her death (above)

The accused man said he did not know 
what apoplectic meant, resulting in Mr Tedeschi putting to him that he 
was ‘berserk’ and ‘beside himself with anger’.

‘I
was angry, yes,’ he agreed, adding that he was ‘humiliated’ and 
‘embarrassed’ that his fiancee had involved the help of two outsiders to
help her leave him.

Shimmers
of light in a hallway captured on a pinhole camera suggested that Miss 
Harnum had tried to leave her apartment for a second time before she 
plunged to her death, it was suggested by Mr Tedeschi.

The
court had heard previously that Gittany had installed the pinhole 
camera for security reasons, but the camera had also captured him with 
his hands clasped around Miss Harnum’s mouth as she tried to leave the 
apartment.

The prosecutor 
wanted to know if Gittany could explain why shimmers of light in the 
hallway suggested that someone had tried to open the door a second time 
after she had originally run into the hall and cried for help at a 
neighbour’s door.

Mr Tedeschi told the court the light flashes were evidence of a struggle between the couple.

Evidence: CCTV footage shows Simon Gittany holding his hands on his head as he rides a lift moments after he allegedly threw his fiancee to her death off the 15th-floor balcony of their Sydney apartment

Gesticulating: Gittany throws his hands up in the air as he heads to the ground floor where the body of his girlfriend is lying in the street

‘I suggest to you that she was screaming for help and banging on the neighbour’s door because you had said or done something that made her think her life was in imminent danger,’ said the prosecutor.

‘What do you say to that?’

‘Absolutely not,’ Gittany replied - and he told the court he could not explain why the door may have opened a second time.

He said he did not make any attempt to go near it after they were both back inside after Miss Harnum had first left.

‘She didn’t even have time to take off her handbag she’d had in the hallway before you threw her off the balcony,’ the prosecutor suggested.

‘Absolutely not,’ said Gittany.

He was pressed on his claim that after Miss Harnum had been ‘subdued’ and dragged back into the apartment she had sat calmly on a sofa while he prepared her a cup of tea.

‘That just didn’t happen did it?’ asked Mr Tedeschi.

‘It did happen,’ replied Gittany.

The trial continues.
