Campaigning mothers are calling for a boycott of children's toy chain Toys 'R' Us for selling a comic in which an openly gay character gets married.

Conservative 'family values' group One Million Moms wants to bring down the firm for carrying the latest issue of the controversial Archie comic - where Kevin Keller walks down the aisle.

It comes weeks after the division of the American Family Association targeted retailer JC Penney for appointing gay talk show host Ellen DeGeneres as its spokeswoman.

Controversial: One Million Moms wants to boycott Toys 'R' Us because it sold this issue of Life with Archie where its openly gay character Kevin Keller gets married to a man

OMM said on its website: 'These comic books are sold at the front checkout counters so they are highly visible to employees, managers, customers and children.

'Unfortunately, children are now being exposed to same-sex marriage in a toy store.

'This is the last place a parent would expect to be confronted with questions from their children on topics that are too complicated for them to understand.

'Issues of this nature are being introduced too early and too soon, which is becoming extremely common and unnecessary.'

'The trip to the toy store turns into a premature discussion on sexual orientation and is completely uncalled for. Toys 'R' Us should be more responsible in the products they carry.'

The series of Archie comics trace the adventures of teenagers Archie, Betty and Veronica in the small town of Riverdale.

It has been running for 70 years, is one of America's most popular comic series, and regularly sells out.

Toys 'R' Us has not commented on the threat, but Archie Comics CEO Jon Goldwater defended his product.

He told the Huffington Post: 'As I've said before, Riverdale is a safe, welcoming place that does not judge anyone. It's an idealised version of America that will hopefully become reality someday.

'We're sorry the American Family Association/OneMillionMoms.com feels so negatively about our product. But they have every right to their opinion, just like we have the right to stand by ours.

'Kevin Keller will forever be a part of Riverdale, and he will live a happy, long life free of prejudice, hate and narrow-minded people.'

The protest comes hot on the heels of OMM's threat to Texas-based retail chain JCPenney.

They told its supporters to petition against Ellen being named the new spokesmodel for the chain store and demand that she be replaced by someone not openly gay.

It said, at the start of February: 'Funny that JC Penney thinks hiring an open homosexual spokesperson will help their business when most of their customers are traditional families.

'Degeneres is not a true representation of the type of families that shop at their store. The majority of JC Penney shoppers will be offended and choose to no longer shop there.'
