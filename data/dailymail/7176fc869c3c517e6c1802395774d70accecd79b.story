With a swimming pool, football pitch, and helipad sprawling across 16,000 square feet of land, it is hard to imagine this was once a tiny family home.

The enormous estate, carved into a cliffside, started life as a two-storey cottage.

But property developer Steve O'Connor and his wife Clare saw potential for a great deal more.

Transformed: This sprawling estate carved into a cliff in Cheshire was once a tiny cottage. It now has a swimming pool, football pitch and a helipad

Helipad: The helipad, overlooking 10 miles of countryside, allows the couple and their two sons Stevie, nine, and Ryan, four, to get to London in an hour

Light: The family made sure to put windows wherever possible so that the underground property is filled with light and does not have damp

Despite heavy planning restrictions, the couple worked closely with an architect to transform their home into something 10 times the size - and a good deal more expensive.

Now on the market for £4.75 million, it is unrecognisable.

The Cheshire property, which they have called home for five years, is equipped with a huge 100-foot
 open plan living space, an indoor sports hall, swimming pool, and a 
football pitch in the huge garden.

There are five bedrooms and ten bathrooms and the house is surrounded by a network of caves which help control the temperature. 

Before: This is the two-storey cottage perched on a sloping hill that Mr O'Connor transformed into a modern estate that delves underground

Work site: The couple spent years working on the land to create a home that fits their exact interests and activities

Modern: Would-be buyers will no doubt be enticed by this unusual, long swimming pool and adjacent sauna with French windows that open onto grass

Living space: Underneath the sprawling garden there is a 100ft hallway that leads onto a kitchen, dining area, and access to five bedrooms

Dining room: The family of four dine in this minimal, purple-and-white-themed room which is separated from the living room with a free-standing wall

Activity: The property will suit buyers with many interests as there is space for a grand piano alongside the football pitch and swimming pool

And thanks to the addition of a helipad, the couple and their two sons Stevie, nine, and Ryan, four, can get to London in an hour.

Mr O'Connor, who owns Widnes Viking Rugby League team in Wigan, said: 'It is essentially a
 modern day country house in size, but if you took out our indulgence, 
the swimming pool, it would have the same energy costs as a three bed 
semi.'

Temperature in the 
home is controlled using a unique air tower which releases hot air in 
the top and lets in cold air at the bottom.

Innovative: The underground home is heated by a network of caves, which has helped Steve O'Connor and his wife Clare get round planning restrictions

Open space: This living space and kitchen area, complete with a breakfast bar, is set in the space above the 100ft hall way

Cutting edge: Property developer Mr O'Connor said he has worked for years with an architect to develop the home from a shabby cottage into a modern complex

Despite the vast amount of open space, the home has the same energy costs as a three-bedroom semi-detached cottage, Mr O'Connor claims

The amount of air released can be regulated depending on the time of year to maintain a constant internal temperature.

Despite the size, Mr O'Connor insists the house maintains a family feel.

He added: 'People assume an underground home would be dark and damp, but this house is flooded with light.'
