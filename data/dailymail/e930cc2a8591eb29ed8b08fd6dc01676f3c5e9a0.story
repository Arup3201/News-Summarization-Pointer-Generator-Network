Radamel Falcao's long-term fitness has been plunged into further doubt after it emerged that the Manchester United striker has to pack his troublesome left knee in ice after every game.

United insisted on a rigorous medical before signing Falcao from Monaco in a £6million loan on deadline day due to the cruciate ligament injury he suffered in a French Cup tie in January that ruled him out of last summer’s World Cup.

The deal could rise to £52m if United decide to sign the Colombia striker permanently next year, but there are growing concerns at Old Trafford about committing to such a huge deal for a player who earns £280,000-a-week and has yet to prove his fitness.

Falcao’s new team-mates are understood to be surprised that he has to wrap his knee in an ice-pack after matches and training sessions to prevent any swelling, and questions have also been asked about his ability to return to peak condition after such a serious injury at the age of 28.

The Colombia star has made just three starts for United and two more appearances off the bench, scoring just once in the win over Everton at Old Trafford last month.

Falcao posted the picture above on Instagram after the Toffees match and it appears to show him with a pack on his knee under the towel.

He has missed the last three games against Chelsea, Manchester City and Crystal Palace due to a calf injury picked up in training, with manager Louis van Gaal said to be harbouring doubts that he is physically up to the challenge of playing regularly in the Premier League. 

But it is his left knee that is more of a long-term concern after Falcao admitted before his United debut in September that he had feared he might not play again.

The former Porto and Atletico Madrid striker came off the bench on his last appearance at West Brom and Van Gaal warned last week that Falcao is not guaranteed a starting place when he returns from injury after United switched to a one-striker system. 

Falcao (pictured at Manchester City) has only played two games in the last six weeks for Man United 

‘I cannot judge him now because now he is injured,’ said the United boss. ‘I cannot say when he will be back. It depends on the progress on his (calf) injury.

‘I changed him (left him out against West Brom) not because of his performance but because the balance of the team, and the team is more important than the individual.

‘I have to decide which striker. It is not his fault with the other system I could play with two strikers but then the balance wasn't good. We had difficulties in the last half an hour.

‘That is why I have remodelled the structure. Since then we have less goals in our favour but also less goal conceded and we have played against the better teams in the Premier League in that time on an equal level more or less.’

Sportsmail have approached Manchester United for comment. 

Falcao's only goal for the club came against Roberto Martinez's Everton at the beginning of October
