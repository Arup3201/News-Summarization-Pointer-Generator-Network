More than 500 people attended the funeral of Ben Pocock in Keynsham, Bristol, more than four months after the 20-year-old student died alongside 297 others when their plane was shot down over Ukraine 

Ben Pocock died while on his way to Australia to undertake a professional placement. The student's body was finally returned to his family four months after his death 

He had been travelling to Australia to undertake a professional placement abroad as part of his university degree. 

His funeral came after a painstaking four-month wait before victims' bodies were released by investigating authorities.

'The last four months has been a desperate and sad time for us as a family but we are relieved to have been able to bring Ben home and accord him with all the love and respect he deserves,' his parents said in a statement before the service. 

'Although we have had a very hard time as a family we are very conscious that there are still nine passengers from the flight that have not yet been identified. 

'Our hearts are with their families and we hope they soon receive the news they are desperately waiting for.

'The forthcoming funeral is about Ben but we will also wish to remember all the other 297 victims of MH17, especially the 80 children and numerous young adults. 

'They did not deserve to die in such brutal circumstances.'

Mr Pocock's coffin was adorned with floral tributes spelling his name and the word friend.

Friends described the keen sportsman as a 'sociable' and 'likeable' young man. 

Hundreds gathered at the St John's Church to pay tribute to the student who was travelling to Australia

'Ben was a very sociable, likeable and talented young man who was so sadly taken from us at such a young age,' said Graham Marsh, chairman of St Mary Redcliffe Cricket Club to which Mr Pocock, his father and his grandfather all belonged.

'I think that he would have progressed so well at university and so on. His death hit the players quite hard. It was difficult to take in at first because he was a close friend. 

An order of service featured photographs of Mr Pocock as a child, teenager and young man.

He was shown beaming at the camera clutching a sporting trophy, playing cricket and tennis, in a swimming pool and striking a Usain Bolt pose.

Andrea Arlidge, headteacher of Wellsway School, which Mr Pocock attended, said the sportsman would be sorely missed.

'Ben was a delightful young man who was bright and talented at sport,' Mrs Arlidge said. 'We have wonderful lasting memories of him.

'When it happened it was a terrible shock and our immediate thoughts were with the family. 

'The family did have a celebration of Ben’s life earlier in the year and we were privileged to be there.' 

A private family cremation took place after the funeral.  

Floral tributes to the student were left as mourners gathered outside the church to pay tribute to the man

Photographs of Mr Pocock at different ages were inside the Order of Service at today's ceremony
