Fitness experts have revealed the latest 'superfood' - and it'll cost you a lot less than chia seeds or lingonberries.

They say walking is the 'superfood of fitness' and  that it may be far better for you than bursts of intense exercise.

Scientist Katy Bowman has explained in her book, 'Move Your DNA: Restore Your Health Through Natural Movement', that the body requires movement nutrients - just like dietary nutrients. 

'Walking is a superfood. It's the defining movement of a
human,' said Ms Bowman, a biomechanist based in Ventura,
California. 'It's a lot easier to get movement than it is to get
exercise.'

Staying healthy: Fitness experts have  said emerging evidence shows that moving around and walking throughout the day is better for you than intense physical activity for an hour

Researchers say emerging evidence suggests that combined
physical activity and inactivity may be more important for
chronic disease risk than physical activity alone.

'Actively sedentary is a new category of people who are fit
for one hour but sitting around the rest of the day,' Bowman
said. 'You can't offset 10 hours of stillness with one hour of
exercise.'

Last year researchers at the University of Texas School of
Public Health asked 218 marathoners and half marathoners to
report their training and sitting times.

Median training time
was 6.5 hours per week. Median total sitting time was eight to
10.75 hours per day, suggesting that recreational distance
runners are simultaneously highly sedentary and highly active.

Leslie Sansone, creator of the 'Walk at Home: Mix & Match
Walk Blasters' DVD, said too many people believe that spending
grueling hours at the gym is the only way to fitness.

'There's this 'Biggest Loser' idea out there that if you're
not throwing up and crying you're not getting fit,' she said,
referring to the popular television weight-loss show.

She added that a small study of non-obese men published in
the journal Medicine & Science in Sports and Exercise by
scientists at Indiana University suggests that three five-minute
walks done throughout three hours of prolonged sitting reverses
the harmful effects of prolonged sitting on arteries in the 
legs.

Three miles (5 kilometers) per hour is a good beginning,
gradually working to four miles per hour, she said about walking.

Dr. Carol Ewing Garber, president of the American College of
Sports Medicine (ACSM), notes that fitness-walking guidelines of
10,000 steps per day may be too much for many.

'About 7,500 steps may be more accurate,' she said, adding
that current ACSM recommendations call for at least 150 minutes
of activity each week.

Garber, a professor of movement sciences at Columbia
University in New York, said research suggests that even one
bout of exercise causes beneficial physiological effects.

But she concedes that walking does not do everything. It is
less beneficial for bones than running, and for strength, it is
better to lift weights.

'Still,' she said, 'If you're going to pick one thing,
research says it should be walking.'
