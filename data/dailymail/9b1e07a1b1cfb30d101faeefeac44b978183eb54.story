A suspected shoplifter was arrested after a new CCTV system compared his face with photographs held on Leicestershire Police's database. 

The man had not previously come to the attention of officers but his father and brother were known to police. 

The new computer system compared the suspect's features with those of criminals already held on the force's database and flagged the family resemblance.

The new technology is not admissible in courts but it provides officers with a possible lead, allowing them to track down other evidence. 

Leicestershire's Chief Inspector Chris Cockerill revealed that the system managed to identify potential suspects in 44 per cent of cases analysed by the system. 

He said: 'There's the potential for this to look like Big Brother... but that's not the case. This is not a surveillance tool, it's an information and surveillance tool for searching for suspects.' 

The new system may be able to identify thousands of other suspected criminals after it was announced that police in London will be routinely issued with body-worn cameras following the shooting of Mark Duggan which led to mass rioting and looting in Tottenham.

Already, police have been equipped with cars fitted with an automatic number plate recognition system. The cameras photograph a car's number plate and run it through police databases, alerting officers if a car is not taxed or insured. Other details such as whether a car is used by a suspected criminal can be included on the system. 

However, Emma Carr of Big Brother Watch told The Independent: 'This takes the intrusiveness of CCTV to the next level, so it is absolutely essential that people are able to access meaningful redress when they feel their privacy is infringed. 

'Many people will see the development of attempting to identify suspects based on the traits of their family members as deeply disturbing.'
