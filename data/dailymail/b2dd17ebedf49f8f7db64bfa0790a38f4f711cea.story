Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet is too modest to claim the club’s recent revival is partly due to his own impressive personal comeback after he had been dropped earlier in the season by manager Brendan Rodgers.

Nevertheless, the facts show that the resurgent Reds go into Saturday's potential top-four decider against Manchester United at Anfield having been beaten only once in 19 domestic games — a Capital One Cup semi-final second leg against Chelsea — since Mignolet returned to the side on Boxing Day.

Prior to that, they had lost four out of seven in the Premier League and had slipped to 10th place.

The Belgian first found out he had been axed the day before Liverpool faced United in the reverse fixture at Old Trafford in December when United won 3-0.

‘The gaffer took me into his office to tell me I wouldn’t play against United. It was disappointing and I could have let my head drop, but I decided to be positive to make sure my period on the sidelines was as short as possible,’ said Mignolet.

‘I trained the next day to make sure I’d be ready in a better way when the opportunity arose.’

His wish came true. When in-favour Brad Jones injured his thigh four matches later at Burnley, Mignolet came on, kept a clean sheet and has not looked back since.

A 1-0 win at Swansea City on Monday was his sixth consecutive clean sheet away from home — the first time that has happened since the days of Bill Shankly.

Victory against United would lift Liverpool into the top four and they would then be favourites to join Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal in next season’s Champions League. The loss at Old Trafford when Rodgers first introduced a three-man defence and played Raheem Sterling up front now appears to be a watershed in the club’s campaign.

‘I don’t think it’s anything to do with me personally,’ said Mignolet. ‘The gaffer changed the system [to 3-4-3] and since then things have been very organised. We don’t give many chances away and everybody is willing to work for each other.

‘It’s all about working as a unit. We have dealt well with set-pieces and at the other end, scored goals.’

Having been heavily criticised for key mistakes earlier in the season and dubbed ‘Dracula’ by former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar for being indecisive with crosses, Mignolet is not taking recent good publicity for granted, even though he was Liverpool’s man-of-the-match at Swansea following crucial saves from Gylfi Sigurdsson and Bafetimbi Gomis.

‘As a goalkeeper you’re only remembered for your last game. I know I played half-decent against Swansea but if things turn around against Manchester United on Sunday, no one will mention that,’ he said.

‘I know how it goes and how football is. You have to accept it, but that is also something positive because there’s always something new around the corner.

‘The next game is always the biggest one. That’s what we say.’

After last season’s thrilling challenge for the league title, Rodgers reacted bravely when the first half to this campaign did not go according to plan.

Summer signings Mario Balotelli, Lazar Markovic, Dejan Lovren, Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert were sidelined, while club captain Steven Gerrard was allowed to negotiate a deal to join LA Galaxy this summer.

Instead, Sterling was used as a centre-forward until Daniel Sturridge’s recent return from injury as Rodgers returned to last season’s quick-passing style.

At the back, midfielder Emre Can was asked to be part of a back-three with Martin Skrtel and the restored Lovren. As results improved, Markovic and Lallana were brought back in and the team remain unbeaten in the Premier League in 2015, having taken 33 points from a possible 39.

Liverpool have narrowed the gap on United from 10 points to two. They are rediscovering the art of scoring goals while keeping it tight at the back.

‘Swansea was an example where we had to grind it out. It was 0-0 at half time and then we came out and put pressure on them high up the field. And we scored out of that [through Jordan Henderson],’ added Mignolet.

‘I think that’s what we are about. The 3-0 defeat away to Manchester United was a while ago and there’s no point in reflecting too much on what has been. Professional footballers have to adapt to any system. It is more to do with the organisation and how everybody does their job rather than the system itself.

‘At the moment, the players are all working really hard. If the gaffer points something out, everybody is ready to listen and make sure it gets done. And it is clicking.

‘There is no point looking over your shoulder [at the past] because what we are thinking about is preparing ourselves the best we can for the Manchester United game.’
