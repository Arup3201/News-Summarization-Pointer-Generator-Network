A farmer shocked police after they stopped his Fiat Punto and found a baby cow in the back.

Zbigniew Grabowski was taking the calf back to his farm after visiting a vet when he was spotted in Mogilno, Poland.

The 53-year-old was pulled over by officers who discovered that his boot had been converted into a farmyard, complete with a straw floor and wooden barriers.

Amoosing: A farmer shocked police after they stopped his Fiat Punto and found a calf cramped in the back

Far from being amused the police told Grabowski he could not continue his journey and would have to walk the calf back to the farm. 

Tomek Mroczkowski was driving in the area when he came across the farmer in a queue.

The 34-year-old said: 'We had come to some traffic lights and I pulled up beside the car next to me.

'I looked over and I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the face of a cow staring back at me. I almost didn't believe it at first.

'The lights then changed and the car drove off with the cow still looking out of the window. It was such a small car, the poor thing must have been a bit squashed.' 

A police spokesman said: 'The driver said he was taking his cow back to his farm and that he had specially adapted the car to carry livestock. 

Milking it: The Fiat Punto is relatively small but the 53-year-old put the back seats down and covered the floor in straw to try and make the cow comfortable

'We explained that he should get a proper truck and that putting a cow in the back of the car was dangerous.'

The farmer was also fined £100 and had his driving licence confiscated.

It comes three weeks after a driver spotted a sheep being driven in the back of a black Volvo.

John Bowden, 44, was on his way home near Tulse Hill station, south London, when he saw the animal staring through the back window of the car in front.
