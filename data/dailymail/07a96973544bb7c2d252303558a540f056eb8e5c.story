Sir Alex Ferguson is 'still in love with Shinji Kagawa' and wishes he could have got more about of the Japanese midfielder, according to Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp.

Kagawa was signed for Manchester United by Ferguson in the summer of 2012 for £12million, but failed to impress during his time at Old Trafford.

He returned to Borussia Dortmund this summer, scoring on his 'second debut' on Saturday, and Klopp says he has lost none of his ability during the two disappointing years.

'I met Sir Alex in Nyon and he's still in love with Shinji,' Klopp told The Sun. 'He told me, "Shame we didn't manage this well so that it worked out for him. We were satisfied in the first year."

'And in the second year you usually make the next step but he didn't manage to do it. But Sir Alex was saying "Shame, we should have made this work". 

Borussia Dortmund face Arsenal in the Champions League group stages on Tuesday, and Klopp wants to use Kagawa to replace the injured Marco Reus. 

It's an unbelievable blow to lose Marco ahead of Arsenal. It was a heart attack but then I though "Ok, I have Shinji"'.
