A police officer called out to reports of a 'vicious dog' terrorizing the streets has ended up adopting the abandoned, affectionate pit bull.

When Officer Dan Waskiewicz arrived at a Baltimore street he said he found people yelling at the frenzied pit bull, which was charging around.

Realizing that the dog was just nervous and neglected, the officer called the pit bull, which immediately came over and started licking him.

'Being a dog lover, I got 
out of my car and called the “vicious dog” over to me. The dog came over
with its tail between its legs and panting,' he told Modified K9.

Instead of seeing a dangerous animal, Officer Waskiewicz said he realized the pit bull was scared. He offered it water and the dog licked him then jumped into his cruiser, in May last year.

Concerned that the dog would be put to sleep if it was picked up by the dog pound, Officer Waskiewicz drove the affectionate pit bull to an animal shelter instead.

On the way to the shelter the dog continued to lick the officer, before curling up next to him and falling asleep.

A couple of days later, when he contacted the shelter to see how the dog was settling in, he discovered it had still not been claimed - so he decided to offer it a forever home and renamed it Bo.

His kind actions earned the officer a certificate of appreciation from Baltimore Humane Society last summer.

'So often we hear stories where law enforcement officers rush to judgment with violent action,'  Baltimore Humane Society's Jen Swanson told CBS DC.

She added: 'When Dan Waskiewicz answered the call he first observed the situation calmly before he acted.'

Bo, who had been kept outside and was filthy when the officer found him, is now settling into a new life with Officer Waskiewicz's two other dogs.

The story of the rescue has been so popular that the pair appeared in Baltimore's Show Your Soft Side campaign against animal cruelty in the city.
