When Michelle Keegan shared a snap of her envy-inducing figure in all its glory on Instagram last week, it went viral.

And now, perhaps unsurprisingly, the 27-year-old has topped the best bikini body poll for the second time.

The former Coronation Street star, who is engaged to Mark Wright, beat off stiff competition from the likes of Rihanna, Beyonce, Kim Kardashian and newcomer Chloe Sims to take the top spot.

Winning...again! Michelle Keegan is no stranger to topping polls and now she's been hailed as having the best celebrity bikini body of 2014

The Weatherfield girl, 27, won with over a fifth of the vote as 22 per cent of respondents chose her as their favourite.

Kim Kardashian, who has been working hard to get back her pre-baby body, came in second place with 18 per cent of the vote while Mark Wright's good friend Chloe Sims came third with 15 per cent of the votes.

Other celebrities to make the list included Rihanna with 12 per cent of the vote, curvy Beyoncé, whose tour body won her 10 per cent, and X Factor sweetheart Cheryl Cole with 8 per cent.

Vicky Pattison, who stunned
 her fans by losing three stone over a six-month period and launched a 
bestselling fitness DVD as a result, took 5 per cent of the votes.

Binky
 Felstead, who recently whipped her body into shape ahead of her raunchy
 calender shoot, also scored 5 per cent of the votes, while 
model-of-the-moment Kendall Jenner also made the top ten, found the survey by Wrappler.

Despite her enviable figure, you won't find Michelle Keegan breaking a sweat in the gym or starving herself on a juice diet.

Speaking
 about her summer health regime, the former Coronation Street star told 
MailOnline: 'I haven't had any time for exercise, I'm gutted. I feel so 
much better when I do work out.

'I don't believe in crash diets or detoxes, I can't live like that. If I have a bad day then I'll have a good day the next.'

The star revealed 
that she tries to fit in 40-minute workouts but 'doesn't like the gym'.

When
 it comes to her diet, she isn't interested in sugary treats but has 
more of a 'savoury tooth' and loves crisps and sandwiches although, one 
look at her latest Instagram feed, and you'd never guess.

Last night saw Mark Wright take his fiancée out for a date night as they enjoyed dinner at his favourite London 
eatery, Nobu.

The pair, both 27,  looked very much in sync as they headed out of London's Sanderson Hotel in smart ensembles while holding hands at all times.

Michelle
 stood out in a white strapless cocktail dress from the new wave of her 
Lipsy collection which is tipped for release on August 13.
