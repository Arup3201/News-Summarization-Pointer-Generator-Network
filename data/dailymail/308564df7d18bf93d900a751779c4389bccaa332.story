Lille have played down the prospects of Divock Origi joining Liverpool early from his season-long loan.

Liverpool need a striker and have clubs showing interest in Fabio Borini and Rickie Lambert but Origi has scored just four goals this season and is struggling to find the form that earned him a starting place for Belgium at the World Cup.

Being thrust into the spotlight at Anfield where the pressure is greater is not seen as the wisest move.

Divock Origi is unlikely to join Liverpool in this transfer window according to Lille

The player is keen to join but much may hinge on how Daniel Sturridge looks on his return to Melwood this week and how his thigh holds up to training and games.

Lille director Jean-Michel Vandamme said: 'Origi to Liverpool now? It would cost at least £4.7m but at the moment it is not possible.'

That Origi hasn't scored in 13 matches might offer some insight into how desperate Liverpool would have to be to pay the fee.
