A pensioner has been arrested for attacking his neighbour with a rusty machete because he was worried a tree might topple into his garden and crush his fence.

Alfred Houghton, 80, is accused of twice slicing 57-year-old Michael Shultz Sr's arm in the backyard brawl in Zephyrhills, Florida, after a conversation at his mailbox turned sour.

Houghton flew into a rage after Mr Shultz apparently refused to remove 'junk' that had fallen into his garden, telling him: 'I am going to kill you.'

Mugshot: Alfred Houghtong, 80, kicked Mr Schultz in the knee and repeatedly swung the machete, catching his alleged victim on the wrist and elbow. He later alluded to police that he wanted to hire a hitman to settle the score with his neighbour

Pasco County Sheriff's Office said he
then ran to his four-wheel drive, returning moments later brandishing 
the timeworn weapon in the air.

He kicked Mr Schultz in the knee and repeatedly swung the machete, catching his alleged victim on the wrist and elbow.

He then got into his vehicle and sped away.

Scene: The alleged attack took place as they were chatting at Houghton's mailbox on Deems Road in Zephyrhills (pictured). The pair began arguing after a conversation about the state of Mr Schultz's garden turned sour

Mr Schultz immediately called the police who tracked Houghton down and arrested him.

Houghton claimed he was acting in 
self defence, citing America's controversial Stand Your Ground law, 
before vowing revenge on his neighbour, the police report said.

Officers said he even alluded to hiring a contract killer to settle the score for him, according to the report.

Houghton faces charges of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon.

He was released on Sunday from the Pasco jail on $10,000 bail.
