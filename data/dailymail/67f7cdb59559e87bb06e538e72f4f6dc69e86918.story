Suzanne Ellis and her partner Ben Bennett love two things in life more than anything else - gardening and the Royal Family.

And as these pictures show, the seasoned horticulturalists really are quite Queen-fingered.

The couple, from Fifield, Berkshire, have painstakingly sculpted two giant busts of Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh and placed them in their front garden for the world to see.

Queen fingers: Made from a mixture of plaster and terracotta, the statues stand at 12 feet tall

Garden bald patch: They are complete with wrinkles, blemishes - and even full heads of green hair. Suzanne and Ben are so loyal to their royal subjects they even remembered to the Duke's bald patch

And for the casual passer by, they are certainly not hard to miss.

Made from a mixture of plaster and terracotta, the statues stand at 12-feet tall and bare a remarkable likeness to the Royal couple.

They are complete with wrinkles, blemishes and even full heads of green hair made from a variety of grasses, plants and flowers.

Potty for the Queen: Suzanne Ellis and her partner Ben Bennett installed the statues as a tribute to the Queen for Jubilee year and rate as possibly the largest and certainly the most patriotic garden ornaments in Britain

The Royal subjects: The statues bare a remarkable likeness to the Royal couple

And Suzanne and Ben are so loyal to their royal subjects they even remembered to the Duke's bald patch and earrings for the Queen.

They installed them as a tribute to the Queen for Jubilee year and rate as possibly the largest and certainly the most patriotic garden ornaments in Britain.
