Steven Gerrard has urged Raheem Sterling to reach an agreement with Liverpool over a new contract.

The forward, who scored twice in the 3-1 victory over Bournemouth in the Capital One Cup quarter-final on Wednesday, has turned down a £70,000 a week offer.

Liverpool chief Brendan Rodgers claims Sterling, 20, is one of the biggest talents in Europe and compared him with Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez after his performance against Eddie Howe’s team.

Gerrard, who is weighing up an extension to his own deal at Liverpool, said: ‘I hope he signs a new contract at the club because I think this club is perfect for him, certainly for the next few years.

‘He’s going to play most weeks, the fans love him here. He can progress here and become a top, top player so I hope the people around him give him the right advice because he should stay.

‘Raheem’s got potential to be top drawer for sure. He took a lot of stick after the weekend but I thought his all-round performance was magnificent, the only thing that was missing was a finish.

‘The exciting thing for all of us is that he’s English and going to be a top, top player.

‘He’s great to watch, great to play with, he’s got that pace. When you look up he’s always giving you an option and that’s what I’ve thrived on throughout my career at Liverpool with the likes of (Fernando) Torres, (Michael) Owen.

‘There’s nothing better as a midfielder when you look up and see pace running in behind.

‘I saw it on numerous occasions against Bournemouth and hopefully it will continue because it stretches teams and creates chances.

‘I think he can play anywhere along the front, he’s that intelligent. He’s got to keep learning, he’s got to keep wanting it.’
