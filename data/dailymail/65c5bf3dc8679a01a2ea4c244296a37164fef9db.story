They were born within moments of one another and they died only two hours apart.

Twin sisters Mary Dickson and Martha Dixon from Granite City, Illinois, passed away last week on Christmas day at the age of 90, having lived in the same home together for the duration of their lives.

Both sisters were said to 'depend on one another' and were married, incidentally, to men who were brothers - both of whom had died before them, reports Fox's KTVI.

Mary and Martha's cause of death has not been disclosed.

One of the twins' granddaughters Amy Deconci said: 'It’s like one had to take the steps to pass and help the other get through that.

'Having them [pass away] together was peaceful but we were broken-hearted at the same time.'

The twins were born September 26, 1924 in Bear Springs, Tennessee, and although they moved to Illinois at some stage, they apparently remained living together under the same roof until they died.

Couple: Mary (left) worked at the credit department of a clothing store for 18 years before she retired and was married to Thomas E. Dickson (right) who had passed away in previous years

'They fought like sisters, but loved each other like sisters,' Amy described. 'They had a bond like no other.' 

Martha was described as a 'homemaker', while Mary worked at the credit department of a clothing store for 18 years before she retired.

They married brothers Thomas E. Dickson and William Dixon, but one had to change the spelling of his last name so that he could re-enlist in the military.

Mary's daughter Diana Hargis said that after her father Thomas died, Mary didn't speak of him much, except to ask Diana whether she was going to 'find' a man for her.

Diana recalls: 'Two weeks ago, I said, "Mom, if you're really good, maybe Santa will bring you one for Christmas." And he did. He took her home to my dad.'

The family said the song 'Santa Baby' was playing when Mary died.

The twins' funeral service will be held tomorrow, and memorial donations can be made to Alzheimer’s Disease Research.
