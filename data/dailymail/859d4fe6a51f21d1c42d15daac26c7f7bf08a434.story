Former vice president Dick Cheney and his wife Lynne have said they are 'pained' over the public dispute between their two daughters over their differing views on gay marriage.

On Sunday, Liz Cheney, who is currently running as a
 Republican candidate for Senate in Wyoming, reaffirmed her disapproval 
of gay marriage on Fox News Sunday despite having a legally-married lesbian 
sister.

‘This is an issue we have dealt with 
privately for many years, and we are pained to see it become public,’ Cheney and his wife said in a joint statement released on Monday.

Mary Cheney and her 
wife Heather Poe, who she married in 2012, both took to social media on Sunday night to blast Liz Cheney.

‘Liz - this isn't just an issue on which 
we disagree - you're just wrong - and on the wrong side of history,’ 
Mary Cheney wrote. 

In a separate Facebook post, Heather Poe called her sister-in-law's comments ‘offensive.’

‘Liz
 has been a guest in our home, has spent time and shared holidays with 
our children, and when Mary and I got married in 2012 - she didn't 
hesitate to tell us how happy she was for us,’ Poe wrote on the social 
media site.

‘To have her now say she doesn't support our right to marry is offensive to say the least.’

Monday's statement from the former vice president and his wife also appeared to be an attempt to bolster Liz Cheney's run for the Wyoming Senate seat.

‘One thing should be clear.
 Liz has always believed in the traditional definition of marriage. She 
has also always treated her sister and her sister's family with love and
 respect, exactly as she should have done,’ said the couple.

Liz Cheney was asked on Fox News Sunday if she was flip-flopping on her gay marriage stance.

Host Chris Wallace pointed out that while she had opposed a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, she had also supporting the State Department's plan to offer benefits to same-sex employees and their partners.

'It's not, and I stand by both of those positions,' Cheney said. 'I don't believe we ought to discriminate against people because of their sexual orientation.

'If people are in a same-sex relationship and they want their partner to be able to have health benefits or be designated as a beneficiary in your life insurance, there's no reason we shouldn't do that.

'I also don't support amending the Constitution on this issue. I do believe it's an issue that's got to be left up to the states. I do believe in the traditional definition of marriage,' Cheney added.

In September her sister Mary Cheney, who legally married her longtime partner Heather Poe in Washington last year and has two daughters, wrote on Facebook saying her sister's stance on gay marriage was 'dead wrong'.

'For the record, I love my sister, but she is dead wrong on the issue of marriage. Freedom means freedom for everyone. That means that all families - regardless of how they look or how they are made - all families are entitled to the same rights, privileges and protections as every other.'

Liz Cheney responded to that message on Sunday, saying that she too loves her sister but this is an issue 'on which we disagree'. 

Cheney's strong-stance on the issue of gay marriage may have to do with her fight to win the senate race in ultra-conservative Wyoming.

Push back? Liz Cheney claims her opponent Mike Enzi is conducting a push poll campaign that asks voters 'Are you aware that Liz Cheney supports abortion and aggressively promotes gay marriage?'

‘I am not pro-gay marriage,’ Cheney previously said in a statement released by her campaign.

Cheney announced her run for senate against incumbent Republican Senator Mike Enzi last month.

‘I believe the issue of marriage must be decided by the states,’ the statement continued, ‘and by the people in the states, not by judges and not even by legislators, but by the people themselves.’

This stance is also a slight departure for the candidate in regards to her high profile father.

Since as far back as 2004, Dick Cheney has maintained a pro-gay marriage stance.

‘Lynne
 and I have a gay daughter, so it’s an issue our family is very familiar
 with,’ Cheney told an audience that included his daughter while 
stumping in Iowa in 2004.

‘With
 the respect to the question of relationships, my general view is 
freedom means freedom for everyone. People ought to be free to enter 
into any kind of relationship they want to.’
