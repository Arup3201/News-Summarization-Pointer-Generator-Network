This is the panoramic view of the skyline of Kobane showing just how close Islamic State fighters have come towards taking control of the Syrian border town.

ISIS flags can be seen fluttering on the hill near to where militants are gathered, just yards from Kurdish forces with reports that the terror group are pouring in reinforcements in their bid to cause Kobane to fall.

The image also shows the exact area targeted by US-led coalition airstrikes and how close the fighting has moved towards the Syrian Turkey border, where Turkish forces are stationed but refuse to intervene.

ISIS is said to have sustained serious losses in the battle for the town despite their superior armour with 36 of its fighters killed 

The UN has warned that if Kobane were to fall to ISIS, thousands of civilians living there are at risk of massacre 

It was revealed today that Kurdish forces have kept up their high-profile resistance in keeping ISIS militants away from the centre of Kobane and halted their advance.

It comes after the ISIS capture of the Kurdish command headquarters in Kobane on Friday failed to deliver a decisive blow and claims the terror group are sending additional forces to the area from other areas they control in Syria including Raqqa. 

Rami Abdel Rahman from the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights explained: 'They are sending fighters without much combat experience.

'They are attacking on multiple fronts but they keep being repulsed, then countering and being pushed back again. 

'It's a decisive battle for them.

'If they don't pull it off, it will damage their image among jihadists around the world.' 

Today the town has been described as relatively quiet apart from some sniper fire. 

Farhad Shami, a Kurdish activist confirmed that ISIS fighters launched an offensive south of the town on Saturday but were repelled and lost many fighters.

He said: 'There are large numbers of dead fighters for Daesh (ISIS) who were either killed by the People’s Protection Units or the (coalition) airstrikes. 

He added that Kurdish fighters also were able to regain the border village of Tel Shair west of Kobane, although the jihadists still control more than a third of the town. 

The blockage on the ISIS advance on Kobane comes amid warnings by the UN that thousands of civilians in the town risk massacre if it falls. 

If ISIS do take the town, they will control territory abutting Turkey to the gates of Baghdad, some 450 miles slicing across Syria and Iraq. 

The main Kurdish armed group, the YPG, said in a statement the airstrikes had inflicted heavy losses on Islamic State, but had been less effective in the last two days.

A Kurdish military official said street-to-street fighting was making it harder for the warplanes to target Islamic State positions.

'We have a problem, which is the war between houses,' said Esmat Al-Sheikh, head of the Kobane defence council.

'The air strikes are benefiting us, but Islamic State is bringing tanks and artillery from the east. We didn't see them with tanks, but yesterday we saw T-57 tanks,' he added.

While ISIS has been able to reinforce its fighters, the Kurds have not. ISIS has besieged the town to the east, south and west, meaning the Kurds' only possible supply route is the Turkish border to the north.

Small groups of Kurdish fighters were trying to harry the encircling jihadists with operations across the front line. 

Turkey has tightened security of its porous border after the fighting in Kobane sparked the exodus of 200,000 refugees over the frontier. 

It has been deeply reluctant to allow weapons or Kurdish fighters to cross the border despite repeated nights of protests among its own large Kurdish minority that have left 31 people dead. 

Reacting to the 31 deaths in Turkey, senior PKK figure Cemil Bayik said the group had called its fighters back to Turkey from bases in Iraq and could resume attacks, threatening a fragile peace process. 

US-led coalition air strikes against ISIS have intensified but the Pentagon says there are limits to what can be done without ground troops

'We have warned Turkey. If the state carries on like this then the guerrillas will resume the war of defence in order to protect the people,' Bayik told German broadcaster ARD in an interview recorded in Iraq.

But Turkey's foreign minister said on Sunday that a corridor allowing weapons and volunteer fighters from Turkey to reach Kobani, the Syrian border town under attack from Islamic State fighters, was unrealistic.

Speaking to France 24, Mevlut Cavusoglu said a more comprehensive approach was needed to defeat Islamic State, which now control large parts of Iraq and Syria and have been targeted by air strikes from a U.S.-led coalition.

But in an interview posted on the France 24 website, Mr Cavuoglu said: 'Turkey cannot actually give weapons and the civilians and ask to go back to fight with terrorist groups.

'This (corridor) is not realistic. Who is going to supply the weapons today? First of all sending civilians to the war is a crime. 

Meanwhile, US-led coalition warplanes launched two air strikes against ISIS targets south and east of town early on Saturday according to the Observatory. 

They added that a sandstorm later prevented more air raids, while fighting raged in southern Kobane and near the captured headquarters.

The coalition has intensified air strikes against ISIS, which began its assault on September 16, but the Pentagon says there are limits to what can be done without ground troops.

Today U.S. Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel has said that the embattled Syrian town of Kobane was a very difficult problem but added that air strikes had made some progress.

'We are doing what we can do through our air strikes to help drive back ISIL. In fact there has been some progress made in hat area,' Hagel told a news conference in Santiago, the Chilean capital.

'It is a very difficult problem. 

The U.S.-led coalition escalated air strikes on Islamic State in and around Kobani, also known as Ayn al-Arab, some four days ago.

Hagel underscored that the battle against the militants, who have seized swathes of Iraq and Syria, was a long-term fight.

'It is a long-term effort. This is difficult, it is complicated. It's going to require many factors. And we are working now (with) coalition partners,' he said.

Turkish armoured vehicles were also spotted patrol the border near Kobane, with some Kurds furious that Turkey has not intervened in the crisis

The Syrian Observatory on Human Rights say at least 554 people have been killed in and around Kobane since the ISIS advance

Asked about the situation in Iraq, Hagel said Iraqi security forces were in full control of Baghdad and continue to strengthen their positions there.

'We continue to help them with air strikes, with our assistance and advisors.'

Meanwhile the U.S. has also been speaking with Turkish officials about increasing their own efforts to equip and train opposition fighters in Syria and U.S. Central Command and European Command will travel to Turkey this week to meet with officials there and discuss the different ways Turkey can contribute.

Today, a Turkish government official confirmed that Turkey has agreed with the U.S. to train 4,000 Syrian opposition fighters. The official said the fighters would be vetted by Turkish intelligence.
