Hillary Clinton tried her best on Monday to walk back her controversial economic body-slam from a speech on Friday, explaining away her claim that it's not 'corporations and businesses that create jobs.'

The talking point three days later: 'So-called trickle-down economics has failed. I short-handed this point the other day, so let me be absolutely clear about what I've been saying for a couple of decades.”

“Our economy grows when businesses and entrepreneurs create good-paying jobs here in America and workers and families are empowered to build from the bottom up and the middle out – not when we hand out tax breaks for corporations that outsource jobs or stash their profits overseas.'

But the damage has been done. Conservatives have a new rally cry – 'Don’t let anybody tell you that it’s, you know, corporations and businesses that create jobs,' she said – and campaign consultants will have a new advertisement drawn up if Clinton runs for president in 2016.

Comics and conservatives lit up Twitter after Hillary Clinton's jobs gaffe -- and didn't let up when she tried to walk it back

Bloomberg News Washington bureau chief Jonathan Allen quickly pointed out Friday, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, that Clinton-haters looking for a source to refute her claims about job creation need look ho further than her own memoir, 'Hard Choices.'

In the book, she writes of American companies 'slowly gaining access to Indian markets, creating jobs and opportunities for people in both countries.'

Later she recalls how a U.S. Chamber of Commerce junket was organized 'because more trade between America and South Africa promised to create jobs and opportunities in both countries.'

But there she was in Boston, appearing alongside stalwart liberal women – gubernatorial hopeful Martha Coakley and Senator Elizabeth Warren – and seemingly trying to maneuver herself into a position more populist than either one.

Warren is a presidential hopeful long pined-for by progressive hardliners who think Clinton is too close to the Democratic establishment to be much of a change-maker.

Another possible explanation for Clinton's Friday gaffe is that she may have omitted words from her prepared speech, as her aides insisted to reporters at the Massachusetts rally. 

An indictment of 'tax breaks for' corporations and businesses, and a claim that they don't aid job creation, would hardly have registered a blip on anyone's campaign radar.

But delivered as it was, 'Don’t let anybody tell you that it’s corporations and businesses that create jobs' brought critics out of the woodwork on Twitter.

'Huh?' comedian John Lovitz tweeted. 'That's not trickle down, that's who hires people.'

'Every job I've gotten is from a business & corporation,' he added. 'And when the corporation goes out of business, people lose their jobs! Common cents!'

And Monday's walk-back notwithstanding, Republicans immediately pointed to Clinton's seeming dismissal of job-creators as a retread of one of President Barack Obama's most loathed talking points. 

During a July 13, 2012 speech in Roanoke, Virginia, Obama offended free-marketeers and small businessmen and women by suggesting that the government had more to do with their successes than they did themselves.

Welcome to Campaign 2016: Clinton's explanation for her ill-timed line on job creation didn't sit well with many -- especially partisans who weren't in her corner to begin with

Everybody's a comedian: Clinton will earn no end of scorn from what the GOP will regard as her 'You Didn't Build That' moment

'If you were successful ... somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we have that allowed you to thrive,' he said. 'Somebody invested in roads and bridges.'

'If you've got a business – you didn't build that. Somebody else made that happen.' 

He said later in the speech that successful entrepreneurs 'didn't get there on your own. I'm always struck by people who think, well, it must be because I was just so smart.' 

The so-called 'trickle-down' economic theory, itself a shorthand for a broader set of ideas, is generally understood to refer to policies that put capital in the hands of business instead of government, with the expectation that the money will create jobs and other economic activity.

Conservative politicians generally express their approval of the idea by green-lighting tax breaks and other benefits to corporations and high-income earners. 

Liberal pols typically criticize the theory by insisting that tax breaks and other government benefits go directly to lower-income Americans, including many who don't pay taxes.
