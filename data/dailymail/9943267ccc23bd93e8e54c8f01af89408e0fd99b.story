The three-year-old son of a teenager who slipped into a coma while undergoing a breast augmentation operation still does not know his mother is sick, her devastated family has revealed.

Linda Perez, 18, a student from Miami, Florida, 
never woke up from the anesthesia after what should have been a routine 
hour-long operation at a clinic in Coral Gables two weeks ago.

She now needs a life-saving tracheotomy to help her breathe. The procedure will again require general anesthesia.

Her
family were told that her heart stopped during the operation and she 
was 'effectively' dead when she was transported to hospital. She suffered brain and heart damage during the procedure.

'What they gave me is essentially a vegetable,' her mother Mariela Diaz told NBC 6.

Perez was admitted to Mercy Hospital following her procedure and her family's attorney, Mark Eiglarsh, said that finding out what went wrong will require litigation.

'How does an 18-year-old healthy young lady go in to have a simple routine cosmetic procedure and come out in a vegetative state?' he asked as he spoke to NBC 6.

Perez paid just $2,800 for the procedure, which is around half of the typical cost of the procedure, according to Eiglarsh.

Dr Jacob Freiman, who performed the 
surgery, has a clean record and is a board-certified plastic surgeon, 
according to the Florida Department of Health.

However it later emerged that the anesthetist Dr Mario Alberto Diaz had previously served time for illegally selling pain pills over the internet.

Dr Diaz served time in federal prison in 2006 for illegally dispensing at least 53,000 doses of pain pills over the Internet. He also had his Florida medical license suspended for six months.

The
parents of the tragic teen have now demanded an investigation into the 
Coral Gables, Florida, clinic. Mariela Perez and Fernando Izquierdo have
called for an inquiry into how their daughter ended up in a coma.

Glamorous: Perez had researched the clinic herself before undergoing the operation, her parents said

Fernando said: 'A young girl so full of life, healthy, and now she's just thrown in bed, like a vegetable. It's sad. It's sad.'

Neither Freiman or Diaz have commented on the situation.

The attorney added that the Perez family is not looking for a big payoff from the center, but could bring a lawsuit.

'This
is about any person that may see this who may have a procedure tomorrow
and may think, "I want to pass on this clinic",' Eiglarsh said. 'Maybe 
save up a little bit of money to go with a place that's a little more 
reputable.'

Perez researched The Coral Gables Cosmetic Center before agreeing to go under the knife.

While
the name of the clinic suggests it is in the upmarket Coral Gables area
of south Florida, it is in fact in Miami and above a pet grooming 
salon.

The clinic's website boasts about its top quality care and surgeons.

It
says: 'Coral Gables Cosmetic offers the latest in cosmetic surgery, 
performed by some of the finest plastic surgeons in South Florida.Â 

'All

'Complimentary

Her dad Fernando Izquierdo said: 'They just ruined our daughter's life and this isn't even compared to the pain we are feeling. She used to be so full of life'

The clinic offers a wide range of cosmetic procedures, including Brazilian butt lifts.

A
statement from the facility read: 'Coral Gables Cosmetic Center prides 
itself on partnering with top medical professionals including 
board-certified plastic surgeons.

'CGCC
