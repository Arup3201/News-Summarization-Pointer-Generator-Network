Is Jimmy Kimmel the most dangerous man in America?

Computer security company McAfee says the talk show host is the most virus-prone celebrity name to Google.

The company said Tuesday that a search for Kimmel carries an over 19 percent chance of landing on a website that has tested positive for spyware, viruses or malware.

The list: Google results for Kimmel are 19.38 percent likely to lead to sites that use spyware or other malware. Googling other celebrities comes with a similar risk

The company has used its own site ratings to make the determination for the past eight years. 

Other celebrities McAfee deems dangerous this year include Ciara, Flo Rida, Bruce Springsteen, Chelsea Handler and Christina Aguilera. 

Kimmel said on Jimmy Kimmel Live! Tuesday that he can't believe a kid who played the clarinet and carried a briefcase to junior high school grew up to be the most dangerous celebrity of 2014.

'The desire for consumers to have access to the latest celebrity information can often make them vulnerable to cybercrime,' said Samantha Humphries-Swift, product manager at McAfee Labs.

'Most consumers do not realise the security risks they are exposing themselves to when searching for celebrity videos and images online.

'But cybercriminals can exploit this desire for breaking celebrity news, leading consumers to sites that download harmful malware on to their devices and compromise personal data.'

It is thought that techniques like this - where users are enticed into clicking a link - known as 'phishing', may have formed part of the hack that had led to the posting of hundreds of nude celebrity photos on online forums.

McAfee has warned that free downloads are 'by far the highest virus-prone search term', and advises people to stick to official websites, and not give out personal information when asked via email or text message. 

Not so boss: Bruce Springsteen was number 5 on the McAfee list. A search for him results in links 18.82 percent likely to lead to a dangerous site
