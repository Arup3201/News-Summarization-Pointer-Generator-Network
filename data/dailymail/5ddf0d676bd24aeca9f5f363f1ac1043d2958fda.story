Booty in hand: Thompson was photographed carrying items looted from the Iceland store in Croydon including bottles of rum

A looter who boasted 'I burned Reeves Corner' minutes after he set fire to a 150-year-old furniture store was today handed the longest jail sentence of any of last summer's rioters.

Gordon Thompson, 34, used a  cigarette lighter to set fire to a sofa in the window of a 144-year-old family business during a night of anarchy.

Moments before he started the blaze, Thompson had been shouting ‘Who’s got a lighter?’ and ‘Let’s torch the place’.

The fire destroyed House of Reeves in Croydon, south London, and was so fierce it spread to other properties, forcing residents to leap for their lives.

The career criminal’s ‘deliberate, wilful act of shocking, dangerous vandalism’ put numerous lives at risk and caused at least £3.5million worth of damage.

Jailing the father of two for 11-and-a-half years, Judge Peter Thornton said that the ‘real cost’ of his reckless actions ‘was in human and emotional terms’.

The judge said: ‘The Reeves family lost their historic business, something they and generations before them had lived and worked for all their lives.

‘The loss was priceless. The trauma they have suffered is inestimable. It is extreme good fortune, and no thanks to you, that nobody died or was seriously injured. But they will be scarred emotionally for a long time.’

The store had passed through five generations of the Reeves family and survived two world wars. Its charred remains have been demolished, but the company is still trading from premises across the street.

Owners Trevor Reeves, 56, and his father Maurice, 81, were at the Old Bailey yesterday to see Thompson sentenced.

Outside court, they said they had accepted his belated apology after ‘a very harsh eight months’.

Mr Reeves senior said: ‘I personally have not a great deal of sympathy for him. He’s put great devastation on the Reeves family and it’s been very difficult. There’s a lot of anger and I think the politicians and the judiciary have a job to do to stop this happening again. It was very difficult to get through it, but we have the old wartime spirit and everybody pulled together.’

His son, who witnessed his store burn down, added: ‘My father has built that store up, that store was his baby. I lived there as a child, played there as a child, I lived there as an adult, I worked there for most of my adult life, and when you lose something like that it’s like a bereavement.’

But the Old Bailey was told in an 
earlier hearing that moments before the blaze started, Thompson had been
shouting 'Who's got a lighter?' and 'Let's torch the place'.

'Lawless': Thompson joined a masked mob as it targeted the Iceland shop and House of Fraser store before he set light to Reeves

Just
two days into Thompson's trial he suddenly changed his 
plea.

The father-of-two had been planning 
to claim he was bravely trying to stop masked rioters looting the store 
when it burst into flames.

Thompson, who lived half a mile from the store, went on the rampage on August 8, looting Iceland and House of Fraser before turning on Reeves.

He was caught on camera clutching bottles he had stolen from the supermarket and helping others prise open the security shutters at the department store.

He brazenly posed for a photographer during the crime spree which ended up on the front page of a local newspaper.

And as images of the inferno he created were being shown on television later the same evening, a witness said he had boasted: ‘It was me – I did that. I burned Reeves Furniture.’

The fire infamously forced Polish shop assistant Monika Konczyk, 32, to jump for her life from her upstairs flat into the arms of rescuers – an image seen around the world.

Miss Konczyk, who lived in a building opposite Reeves, was left too scared to go out and could not go to work without her sister accompanying her.

Thompson pleaded guilty to arson and three counts of burglary.

He had initially denied arson, but 
changed his plea two days into his trial, as it became clear his numerous 
criminal actions on the night had all been caught either on CCTV, in 
mobile phone video footage or in photographs.

In mitigation, the court heard he had 
been depressed about his divorce at the time of the riots, and had not 
intended to cause such huge damage by setting fire to one sofa cushion.

He ‘could not believe’ what he had done, and it will be something he would ‘regret for a long time’.

Adam Davis, QC, defending, said: ‘He wanted me on his behalf to 
apologise to all those involved and in particular the Reeves family for 
what happened as a result of his reckless actions and apologise for the 
loss that he has caused them, a loss that he could not have foreseen.

‘Thug life baaaabe’ – that’s how shameless crook Gordon Thompson liked to describe his days of violent crime.

The 34-year-old struggled to hold down a job and by the time of his arrest for arson he had amassed 20 convictions.

Confession: Gordon Thompson - branded a 'cynical coward' in court - was jailed for 11 years six months

Last night it emerged that his criminal career dates back to his teens and he has been jailed five times for a total of seven years.

The most serious was for an armed robbery 12 years ago in which he joined a gang armed with machetes and was jailed for four-and-a-half years.

For many, that sentence might have been a wake-up call, but for Thompson it only fuelled his lawlessness.

By the spring of 2011 he had been  convicted of beating up his wife, assault, car theft, shoplifting, cocaine possession, resisting arrest, failing to surrender and carrying knives.

He even openly boasted about being wanted by the police over drugs.

Writing on his Facebook wall, Thompson revealed: ‘I am on the run from the cops. **** them all. Thug life baaaabe. Up one min and next ya down. **** the world we live in cos we are all dogs on the a ball [cocaine].’

One of four brothers, he first came to the attention of the authorities in 1995 when he was caught fare dodging.

Over the next few years he was jailed twice as he amassed convictions for robbery, shoplifting, threatening behaviour and possessing an offensive weapon.

In August 2000 he was jailed for a third time for joining three others in an armed raid at a restaurant.

Comment on the riots

During the following decade, Thompson’s criminal career showed no signs of slowing with convictions for theft, assault, carrying knives and motoring offences.

At the dingy Croydon town centre flat where he lived, neighbours said he was a quiet man with a taste for flashy clothes.

Working occasionally as a decorator, he doted on his two children. But in the months before the riots, he had separated from his wife and was locked in a bitter battle for access.

It was his bravado that finally caught him after he was photographed carrying bottles of rum and whisky from a looted store.

Wearing a distinctive red hoodie, his grinning face appeared on the front page of a local newspaper under the headline: ‘Help bring these rioters to justice.’

Despite this, Thompson could not resist strutting through Croydon town centre where he was spotted by a council worker.

He was arrested within minutes and brazenly told police he knew about the picture and was about to hand himself in.

The council worker later said: ‘He was very casual and had a smile on his face as he was swaggering through. He was looking around and just seemed very comfortable with himself.

‘I said to him, “Do you realise you are on the front of the local paper?” He said, “Oh **** it, they know where I am, if they want me they can find me”.’
