With rumours circulating in the last week that Alejandro Sabella has lost the support of the Argentina dressing room, striker Ezequiel Lavezzi did not help matters by squirting the coach with water during their win over Nigeria.

According to reports the Argentina team rose as one at half-time in their opening game win over Bosnia-Herzegovina and demanded Sabella switch formation from a 5-3-2 to captain Lionel Messi’s favoured 4-3-3.

And the water bottle incident in the second half in Porto Alegre suggested Lavezzi is not Sabella’s biggest fan.

Making a splash: The water hits Sabella on the top of his head

The Paris Saint-Germain forward linked well with Messi and Angel di Maria after replacing the injured Sergio Aguero, but his most memorable involvement was while on the touchline taking instructions from Sabella.

Between taking swigs from a water bottle Lavezzi - with his back to Sabella - appeared to intentionally squirt water over his shoulder and on to the Argentina boss’ suit.

Messi was the hero once more for Argentina as he struck twice in the first half in their 3-2 victory to make it three wins from three group stage matches.
