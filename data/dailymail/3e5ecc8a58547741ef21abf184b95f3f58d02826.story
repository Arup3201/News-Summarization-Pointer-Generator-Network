A New York City cop has been filmed verbally abusing a street vendor while dancing in a circle and yelling 'blow me' b*tch'.

The vulgar confrontation was filmed as the female officer taunted a man legally selling ice-cream from a Mr Softee truck in Manhattan over the summer.

The cop is seen yelling 'Go for it' as she spins on spot with her hands raised in a film recorded on a camera phone and released by the Street Vendor Project group.

Offensive: This New York City cop was filmed making an obscene gesture and using vulgar language

When the vendor, who has asked to remain anonymous to avoid reprisals, called her a maniac and asked why she was acting that way, the cop yelled: 'What is wrong with you? What is wrong with you?'.

The ice-cream seller is then heard saying: 'You gotta stop acting up like this,' prompting the cop to become abusive.

As she makes an obscene gesture, the cop can be heard saying: 'Blow me b*tch,' as she walks away.

The behavior is a far cry from NYPD's motto of 'Courtesy, Professionalism, and Respect,' Gothamist commented.

The campaign group that uploaded the footage to YouTube said the incident wasn't a one off.

'This officer had confronted and been 
disrespectful to him on numerous prior occasions. This is the first time he captured it on video,' a caption stated.

Street Vendor Project is a group devoted to supporting the city's 20,000 street tradesmen, many of whom are immigrants or military veterans.

The small businesses, which sell everything from hotdogs and nuts to handbags, are often bullied or overlooked by city officials, the campaign group claims.

New York City police department has not yet responded to a request for a comment.
