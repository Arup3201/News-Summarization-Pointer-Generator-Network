 IN BARBADOS

England’s nightmare winter took another self-inflicted turn for the worse when Ben Stokes was ruled out of the World Twenty20 after fracturing his hand punching a dressing rook locker.

The bizarre twist emerged when it was revealed that the Durham all-rounder hit out in frustration after being dismissed first ball in what became a narrow victory for England here over West Indies in the final Twenty20 international before the team left last night for Bangladesh.

‘It was a huge error of judgment following a frustrating tour for me and I deeply regret my behaviour,’ said Stokes, who is replaced in England’s World Twenty20 squad by Warwickshire all-rounder Chris Woakes.

Cleaned up: Stokes' middle stump goes flying after he is bowled by Krishmar Santokie first ball

Contrast: West Indies seamer Santokie celebrates bowling Stokes, who trudges off

Coming up just short: Stokes is run out by Denesh Ramdin in the first Twenty20 match

Net loss: No amount of practice could get Stokes back into form in Twenty20 cricket

The emergence of Stokes in Australia 
was a major plus for England amid the wreckage of their worst ever tour 
but a character who has had disciplinary problems before clearly still 
has something of a temper.

The
 effects of Australia seemed to have taken their toll on Stokes here in 
the Caribbean where he made only nine runs in three one-day 
internationals in Antigua and four in two Twenty20 matches here in 
Barbados.

Cheeky: Kevin Pietersen reminded the ECB that he is available for selection

Rare success: Stokes was one of the few Ashes bright spots, scoring England's only century in Perth

Worry: Stuart Broad (centre) had to watch two of England's T20s in the West Indies from the sidelines because of injury

Sidelined: Joe Root will miss the tournament in Bangladesh with a broken thumb

Niggle: Eoin Morgan has been playing through the pain barrier in the Caribbean

At least the 
embarrassing episode will allow Stokes to have what is probably a much 
needed rest but it is another blow for England, who saw Joe Root ruled 
out after breaking his thumb in more conventional cricketing fashion.

Skipper Stuart Broad is also struggling with a knee problem, while Eoin Morgan has been playing despite suffering a similar injury.
