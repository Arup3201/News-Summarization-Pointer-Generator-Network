Romelu Lukaku has revealed that he feels 'blessed' to be working with strike partner Samuel Eto'o at Everton.

The Toffees pair both signed from Chelsea in the summer, but did not bring a ready-made partnership due to Lukaku spending the majority of last season on loan at Goodison Park.

The Belgian forward's club record £28million price tag - and a lengthy list of rival suitors - might have made him Everton's marquee arrival, but Eto'o's free transfer appears an equally sound piece of business.

The veteran, arguably Europe's most feared goalscorer during his time at Barcelona, rolled back the years against Burnley on Sunday, netting a bullet header and classy long-ranger.

They were his third and fourth of the season but Lukaku, who was also on target in a 3-1 win at Turf Moor, believes Eto'o's value as a mentor is just as important.

'He's a world class player. He's scored so many goals throughout his career and I've been blessed to be working with him,' said Lukaku.

'I spend most of the time with him. I come in at the same time as he does, I leave at the same time. We do everything together on and off the pitch as well.

'In training we have a finishing competition and the one who loses has to do sprints.

Lukaku says he and Eto'o spend a lot of time together and are both enjoying life at Goodison Park 

'We see each other quite often. He comes to my house, I go to his house. I try to learn as much as I can from him and he tells me stories about how he worked when he was younger.'

Lukaku has not been short of decorated senior figures to learn from during his time in England and he has set his sights on making a name of his own that will rival the very best.

'Samuel has the same impact as (Didier) Drogba and (Nicolas) Anelka had on me when I was younger at Chelsea,' he said.

'In that aspect I think I've been blessed to work with top strikers like them. I hope to be one of them in the future.'

The 21-year-old still has a way to go before he can bracketed with those stellar performers, but his potential remains huge.

His goal against the Clarets, an untidy but effective finish, was just his fourth in 15 appearances this term - a mark he had already reached after four games last year.

'It was a slow start but now I'm getting where I want to be,' he said.

'I've scored back-to-back Premier League goals now so I only want to look forward.

'I'm working very hard and I'm almost at 100 per cent. I think the best has yet to come.

'I put myself under pressure, I really want to succeed and I really want to help my team-mates and the club by scoring goals, by winning games. It's nothing special, it's nothing new.'
