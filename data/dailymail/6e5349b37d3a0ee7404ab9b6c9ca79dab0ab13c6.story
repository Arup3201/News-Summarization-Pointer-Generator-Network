Scottish swimmer Dan Wallace was told yesterday he would face no further action after screaming ‘For Freedom’ following his gold medal victory in the men’s 400m individual medley.

The swimmer had simply become carried away with patriotic fervour after watching his favourite Hollywood historical blockbuster, Braveheart, Commonwealth Games spokesman Jackie Brock-Doyle said.

‘Daniel watched Braveheart on the plane over from Florida. What he shouted was purely about the film that he watched,’ she said.

Games officials are satisfied the 21-year-old did not breach their ban on political statements. 

Mike Hooper, chief executive of the Commonwealth Games Federation, said: ‘We have issued a statement outlining that the Games should not be used for political statements.’

After Friday’s incident, Wallace said: ‘I just yelled at the top of my lungs for freedom because being here, the home crowd has really brought out the Braveheart and Scot inside of me and I just soaked up the moment.

'I watched Braveheart just last week to get ready for this. It is such a Scottish thing and it warms my heart.’

Wallace, who studies at the University of Florida, was almost axed from the team two months ago when he was arrested for urinating on a police car.
