These eight female puppies were found dumped on the side of a highway in Houston, Texas, on Thursday morning inside a bag of dog food.

They were taken to a local vet by a good Samaritan and promptly named after Santa's eight reindeer. Now they're set to fly on to new homes in time for Christmas.

David Cradic from North Houston Veterinary Specialists told KHOU.com: 'All eight puppies are very healthy. They're happy hungry, eating well.'

The dogs are thought to be Australian Shepherd and Rottweiler mixes. 

They were discovered near Willowbrook Mall by an unidentified man who heard them whimpering.

After staying in for overnight observation the puppies will now be transferred to the Abandoned Animal Rescue shelter. 

They will remain in foster care for a few weeks before being put up for adoption.

Dozens of people have already expressed interest after hearing about their plight.

'They are so beautiful, momma must be missing them how can anyone do this. It's very sad and I hope they find great homes,' one commenter said.
