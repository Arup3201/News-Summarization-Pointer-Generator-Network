Fugitive: Raymond Bowden has been jailed for five years for his part in a £4.5million VAT fraud

A corrupt company director, nicknamed 'Arthur Daley' after the wheeler-dealer character from television show Minder, has been jailed for five years for his part in a £4.5million VAT fraud.

Raymond Bowden, 69, helped mastermind a criminal enterprise which imported duty-free platinum ingots into Britain from Italy and then sold them on at inflated prices.

He went on the run after he was caught in the act by customs officials who secretly filmed him arranging shady deals.

Bowden, of Altrincham, Cheshire, was found guilty of cheating the taxman in his absence last August and was about to be sentenced by a judge before he unexpectedly turned himself in at court to face justice.

Judge Robert Warnock, sitting at Liverpool Crown Court, described the conspiracy as a 'well-orchestrated and cynical VAT fraud motivated by greed'.

Bowden had been a well-known trader in antiques and precious metal in the Lytham and Blackpool areas of Lancashire.

But his gang's activities were unmasked in an undercover sting carried out by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) investigators.

Footage showed him acting as a courier, picking up weekly shipments of 1kg ingots at UK airports and delivering them in luxury hire cars to other members of his gang.

The gang bought the precious metal VAT-free from two firms in Italy and had it processed to reduce its purity.

It was then brought to the UK, where it was sold via a string of firms to legitimate customers with their own 17.5 per cent 'VAT' added to the price.

For two years the gang pocketed the difference before liquidating the businesses to hide any trace of wrongdoing.

Customs officers said platinum was attractive to fraudsters as it was 'high value but easily transportable and generates a large amount of VAT'.

Bowden, whose part in the scam generated about £1.4million of the total fraud value, absconded in the second week of an eight-week trial and a warrant had been issued for his arrest before he showed up at Liverpool Crown Court.

Bowden was banned from being a company director for six years upon his release and was also handed a Serious Crime Prevention Order, which can restrict his future employment or business deals.

Ringleader: Shabir Karim, whose parents were killed in a bungled robbery in 1999, was the principal controller of the fraud

The principal controller of the fraud was Shabir Karim, 40, a director of Bullion Traders whose parents were stabbed to death in a bungled robbery at their jewellery shop in Blackburn, Lancashire, in 1999.

Karim was sentenced to seven years in jail and upon his release is banned from being a company director for eight years.

Kamran Bhatti, 40, and his bother Imran, 39, both of Blackburn were each jailed for five years and disqualified from running another company for four years.

All were found guilty of conspiracy to defraud the taxman.

A fifth man, Raymond Mancini, 65, of Blackpool, was cleared of wrongdoing.

Alan Lee, HMRC director of criminal investigation, said: 'The guilty men simply pocketed the cash for their own personal gain.

'Tax fraud and attempts to launder the proceeds of crime are treated extremely seriously by HMRC, and we will relentlessly pursue any individuals or crime gangs believed to be attacking the public revenue in this way.'

Authorities will seek to seize the conspirators' ill-gotten gains at a confiscation hearing next year.
