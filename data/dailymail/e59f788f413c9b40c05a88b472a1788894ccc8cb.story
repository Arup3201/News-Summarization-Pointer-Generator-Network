As the nation prepares to tune in to the Christmas Day special of Downton Abbey, the real-life mistress of the house has told how a frisky Earl led her a merry dance.

Lady Carnarvon, who with her husband owns Highclere castle where the hit TV series is filmed, had to shout to her staff for help as she chased through the grounds after Earl, one of her ponies.

It happened after she and Lord Carnarvon arrived back suffering from jet-lag at the castle in Highclere, Hampshire, following a trip to New York.

Millions of viewers are preparing to settle in for a feature length edition of Downton Abbey on Christmas Day

Millions of viewers are preparing to settle in for a feature length edition of Downton Abbey on Christmas Day. It follows a special charity skit involving cast members and Hollywood heavyweight George Clooney. 

But revealing her real-life drama at the castle, Lady Carnarvon wrote on her website: 'One night we were at a New York Gala, with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge arriving to support St Andrews University. Long dresses, amazing fund raising (I think our auction prized hit the top note) and then back today to chasing naughty ponies around fields.

'The little chestnut pony, Earl, nosed out of the field gate and escaped within one unfortunate second.

'Revelling in freedom, lots of grass and the huge area in front of the castle, I had no hope of catching him. The large open landscape and park rather lost its attractions for me at that moment. Earl just kicked up his heels.'

She described how she returned to the castle courtyard and asked a man to help her - but after attempting to herd the animal towards a corner he remarked: 'I did not know he could move so fast'.

Lady Carnarvon added: 'We retired for coffee. No other man offered to help (they were all remarkably busy around cars).

'But they had wished they had videoed me running round the field! 

'I changed into the next set of clothes to trudge out and get wet again. It was two hours into my morning, the fields are truly huge.

'I walked to retrieve the trail of empty food buckets with which I had been trying to bribe the happy Earl.

'To my delight he started to follow me so I realised that rather than catch him, I and the buckets and he would all try to go through a gate together. And oh joy it happened.

'At lunchtime my husband - the other Earl - said it was a bit silly not to shut the gate carefully first of all, so he was quite lucky to get any supper!'
