Petrol thieves have drilled into an underground pipeline and caused a leak of thousands of litres of fuel next to a popular fishing river, sparking a major environmental alert.

About 150,000 litres of fuel have contaminated soil close to the River Kennet, just upstream from top public school Marlborough College in Wiltshire.

Police are investigating the attack on the Esso refinery pipeline, believed to be the first of its kind in the UK.

A Wiltshire Police source told The Mail on Sunday: ‘We’re used to fuel being stolen from farms by rural criminals but this is quite a step further. Two men have been detained in the Somerset area with a large amount of illicit fuel but at this stage we don’t know if the two incidents are linked.’

The theft was from the Midline pipeline, which carries fuel from the Fawley Refinery near Southampton to the Birmingham Fuels Terminal.

Using a technique more common in Iraq, the thieves dug down about 8ft to get to the pipeline, then drilled a small hole in it.

They connected a hose to the pipe which they ran to a road nearby and then covered with soil. After putting a tap on the end of the hose and covering their tracks, it is believed they returned at night to fill containers.

The pipeline alternates between carrying petrol and diesel fuel.

But three weeks ago a plough tore the illicit hose from its shallow trench and ripped it out of the pipeline, causing the leak. John Hounslow, who operates a trout farm on the river, said: ‘The big fear is that this fuel will get into the river and destroy the food chain. It’s very worrying.’

Esso is leading the efforts to contain the spill and is drilling at the site to try to discover what is happening to the fuel beneath  the surface.

However it is unclear whether it will be washed into the river or sink into the chalk below.

A spokesman said: ‘It’s very unfortunate and technical work is going on to try to establish whether this will affect the water table and the river.’

Charlotte Hitchmough, spokeswoman for environmental group Action for the River Kennet, said: ‘It is worrying and we hope the river won’t be badly impacted but no one can predict where  the fuel will end up.’
