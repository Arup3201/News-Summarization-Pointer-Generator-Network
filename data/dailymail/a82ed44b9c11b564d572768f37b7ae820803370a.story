Adam Ashe admits Scotland are desperate to avoid a Six Nations whitewash — even if victory over Ireland today means handing the Championship crown to old rivals England.

Defeat at Murrayfield today would ensure a fourth wooden spoon and third whitewash in 12 years for the home side, who have been relegated to a mere sideshow in what is set to be thrilling finish to this year’s tournament.

Adam Ashe is determined to spoil the Irish party at Murrayfield on Saturday

The day kicks off with Italy playing Wales at the Stadio Olimpico, before Scotland host Ireland and then England round things off against France at Twickenham.

Wales, Ireland and England are all locked on six points each, with the destination of the title set to be decided on points difference.

As things stand, England are in the driving seat with a points difference of 37 from their first four games, with Ireland on 33 and Wales off the pace with 12.

The Irish will be determined to run in the tries against Scotland, so as to apply pressure to Stuart Lancaster’s men when the take on the temperamental French.

Ashe, for his part, is determined to spoil the party.

‘Ireland are focusing on a big win and looking forward to taking the title but we don’t want to let that happen, regardless who goes on to win the Championship,’ said the Glasgow Warriors forward. 

Ashe doesn't think his selection was a gamble for such an important match

‘I would say there is more pressure on us going into this match because we have been losing games while playing well.

‘Yes, Ireland have got a lot of pressure on them to win the Championship — but that could be taken out of their hands by us.’

Ashe, who has been brought into the Scotland side at the expense of Rob Harley, denied it was a gamble throwing him in from the start of a such an important match.

The 21-year-old, who picked up a neck injury playing against New Zealand back in November, said he was now at peak fitness despite playing a total of just 94 minutes of professional rugby in 2015.

‘I played in the Munster game a few weeks ago and that was my first game back after three months out,’ said Ashe. ‘I had a bit of a reaction with my neck a few days after but it settled down quickly enough. That was always going to happen coming back from my injury.

‘Although I have not played much rugby, I am hungry for it. I am not just physically ready but also mentally ready, too. I want to go out there and give everything I’ve got against Ireland.

‘It was tough missing the first three Six Nations games through injury but I am glad to be back involved and able to do my part.’
