The former boyfriend of married Victoria's Secret CEO Sharen Turney is writing a memoir which will include details of their torrid two-year affair.

Naples, Florida luxury real estate broker Cliff Donenfeld, 51, started writing the memoir last fall after exposing the relationship to the New York Post's Page Six.

Donenfeld initially decided to reveal his long-term affair with older-woman Turney, 56, when she declined to give him a reference for a job in fashion.

Since then, sources close to Donenfeld say Turney has been trying to block the publication of the book tentatively titled 'Side Guys'.

Sharen's helper: Turney has been the CEO of Victoria's Secret since 2006. During their two-year affair, Donenfeld says he became the lingerie exec's sounding-board on things like that annual fashion show

'After the article, Cliff noticed black SUVs outside his house,' a source told the Post. 'He was then contacted by a Victoria's Secret private eye who wanted to meet with him and their lawyer.'

Another source said that Turney's conservative bosses at Ohio-based L Brands are not happy with the scandal.

'They've been trying to shut down Cliff and convince him not to include her in his book. But he's standing up for himself,' a friend added. 'His book has many people and many chapters. This is one chapter. He contributed to Victoria's Secret.' 

Donenfeld and Turney started dating around 2008, and he soon after broke up with his girlfriend so he could spend more time with the lingerie exec in Florida, New York and Ohio.

Donenfeld claims Turney relied on him for advice on everything from the Victoria's Secret fashion show, to what she should wear.

'She didn’t go out in public without my input,' he told the Post last year.'I was instrumental in every aspect of her life for two years. I was her sounding board, personally and professionally.'

Changed man: A source close to Donenfeld says he's dating someone new and has turned his life around after getting baptized. He now attends church every Sunday

During their two-year romance, Turney allegedly promised to buy her boyfriend a multimillion dollar home in Naples' exclusive Port Royal community, but all he got was a Cartier watch.

Things got more serious in 2010, when Turney was considering a professional move to Harrod's in the UK.

Donenfeld says Turney asked him to move to London with her, where they could start a new life together and adopt a baby.

'At the time, she was discussing a move to Harrods,' he said. 'She said it would be much easier to start our lives over again in London. She said she’d place me in a job at Harrods.'

But when Donenfeld scheduled an 
appointment for Turney at a New York divorce lawyer, so she could 
finally leave her husband, Turney wavered.

She said she wanted to 'wait until the holidays' to let Charles, her husband of more than 20 years, know.

The
 relationship fizzled out in 2010 and the two remained friends until 
Turney offended Donenfeld by not providing him with a professional 
reference.

Despite Turney trying to stop the publication of the book, Donenfeld says he's pushing on.

'It is in my rights to write my memoirs,' he commented to the Post, 'and I will write them.'
