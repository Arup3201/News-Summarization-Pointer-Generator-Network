He's the self-made millionaire who has succeeded at everything he's taken on - from court cases against foreign governments to mastering emerging technologies and playing the stock market.

He was Australia's richest politician long before Clive Palmer arrived on the scene.

Now, the ultimate prize may be in sight for Malcolm Turnbull.

While Liberal MPs today defeated a spill motion that would have brought on a challenge to Prime Prime Minister Tony Abbott, the leadership crisis is almost certain to continue.

And while it does, Mr Turnbull will stay the man most likely to take over as leader, and prime minister.

MPs have reportedly confirmed that the current Communications Minister (pictured) will contend the leadership if a spill motion proves successful on Monday morning 

On Monday, the Liberal Party will decide whether to dump Prime Minister Tony Abbott (right) as leader while Malcolm Turnbull (left) is almost universally considered to be the only realistic challenger to Mr Abbott

Liberal MPs voted 61 to 39 against a motion to bring on a vote on Mr Abbott's leadership, meaning a substantial bloc of the party wanted the opportunity to oust the prime minister.

Observers interpreted the result as meaning Mr Abbott's leadership is still in dire trouble.

While Mr Turnbull has remained publicly silent on the issue, MPs have reportedly said he was ready to challenge Mr Abbott for the leadership if it came to a vote.

He is almost universally considered to be the only realistic challenger to Mr Abbott, who defeated him in a leadership ballot six years ago - by one vote. Mr Abbott went on to win the 2013 election and become prime minister.

While mutinous Liberal MPs see Mr Abbott as having lost touch, a belief fuelled by the Australia Day Prince Phillip knighting incident, Mr Turnbull regularly scores well in opinion polls and is considered a colourful and cunning character with his head in the game.

His love for technology and his constant online presence stands in contrast with the Prime Minister's recent comparison of Twitter to 'electronic graffiti' which he said was 'a big mistake to pay too much attention to'.

As reports circulated that he was holding a secret meeting with potential leadership plotter Julie Bishop last week, Mr Turnbull responded by tweeting a photograph of him smiling as he sat, alone, on a train miles from where the supposed meeting took place

Mr Turnbull is an avid user of the medium, and has 327,000 Twitter followers compared to the prime minister's 440,000. In one example of Mr Turnbull using social media to his advantage, as reports circulated that he was holding a secret meeting with potential leadership plotter Julie Bishop, he responded by tweeting a photograph of him smiling as he sat, alone, on a train miles from where the supposed meeting took place.

'@BenFordham you need to improve yr [sic] surveillance! I am on the train to Tuggerah. PoliticsinPub Nth Wyong 2nite,' the caption read.

The technology obsession stems from way back for Turnbull, who co-founded OzEmail - which at one point was one of the largest internet service providers in the country - back in 1994. 

It was an investment that reportedly made him $60 million when he finally sold it in 1999, Fairfax reported. 

But the former investment banker's fortune was evident long before the sale, when he purchased his first million dollar property in Sydney's exclusive suburb of Point Piper, also in 1994. 

A second purchase next door, for over $7 million just a few years later, allowed him to expand his exclusive section of the waterside even further, according to Fairfax.

Mr Turnbull and his wife then sold that property in 2011 for $13.6 million. 

His current harbour-side Point Piper estate is close to the Altona mansion which sold for about $52 million, Fairfax recently reported.

Despite his great wealth - he was valued at $186million on BRW's rich list in 2010, Fairfax reported - Mr Turnbull is keen to dispel the 'silvertail' tag and portray himself as a self-made man who rose to the top from next to nothing.

In an interview with GQ, he said: 'I've taken the view that one's wealth is the result of hard work and good judgement, but a large part of it is luck.'

On a number of public occasions, he has also recalled his turbulent childhood, in which his parents divorced and his mother took off with most of the family's belongings.

'I know what it's like to be very short of money. I know what it's like to live in rented flats, I know what it is like to grow up with a single parent,' he said back in 2008 when he was chosen to lead the Liberals, according to The Australian.

Raised by his father and reliant on scholarships for his education at Sydney Grammar, and as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford - an honour he shares with Mr Abbott - there are now predictions that if he become prime minister, Mr Turnbull would revisit the Gonski education reforms.

A father-of-two himself, Turnbull is well known as a family man, and a romantic one at that. 

He has been married to Lucy Hughes - the daughter of one of Australia's leading barristers and former conservative attorney general Tom Hughes - for more than 30 years.

Mr Turnbull recalled how the pair met, in an Australian Women's Weekly article last year.

'She was 19 and I was 23. Our first encounter was not across a crowded room, or on a dance floor, but in the otherwise thoroughly unromantic environment of her father's legal chambers where she was working over the summer holidays,' he wrote.

'I was so in love and so worried I would lose her that I asked her to marry me soon after we met. She said we should wait until we grew up. Thankfully, we didn't (it is not entirely clear that men ever grow up, of course) and we were married two years later, in 1980.

'Over the years, we have grown together. It is almost impossible to imagine, let alone remember, what it was like not to be together, so much so that I have a much clearer sense of 'Lucy and me' than I do of 'me'.'

Lucy Turnbull is no shrinking violet herself, becoming Sydney's first woman Lord Mayor in 2003.

Mr Turnbull's views on climate change, his leadership of the campaign for Australia to  dump the British monarchy and become a republican at the 1999 referendum, and his liberal views on gay rights and other issues have stamped him as an iconoclastic conservative.

As an investment banker in the 1980s, Mr Turnbull's partners included former NSW Premier Neville Wran, a Labor stalwart, and former ALP Prime Minister Gough Whitlam's son Nicholas.

Mr Turnbull has said he was approached by Labor to join that side of politics, and that he politely turned them down. 

It was as a lawyer that Mr Turnbull first came to public notice, as a brash and confident young barrister who took on the British Government in the 1986 Spycatcher trial.

Fighting for former British Spy Peter Wright, whose book was accused of revealing top secret information, Turnbull's victory meant the book and its excerpts were allowed to be published.

He later famously defended Kerry Packer against drug trafficking and tax evasion accusations.

In some ways, Mr Turnbull's past is not unlike Mr Abbott's - both of them studied at the University of Sydney and Oxford and both of them went on to work as journalists.

In policy however, they are worlds apart: Turnbull for one, once supported an emissions trading scheme, has clarified his stance as a firm believer of climate change and has voiced his support for gay marriage quite openly.

When Mr Abbott won their first leadership contest in 2009, a devastated Mr Turnbull initially indicated he would quit politics, before changing his mind and accepting the role of opposition communications spokesman, and later minister. 

On Monday, Australia will watch if he is forced to bite back the promise he once uttered during an interview with GQ: 'I resolved, when I decided to stay in parliament, that I would do everything I could to give Tony a loyalty and a consistency that not all my colleagues gave me.

'I've done that. If Tony is unsuccessful — and I don't think he will be — no one will be able to say Malcolm Turnbull was anything other than supportive.'
