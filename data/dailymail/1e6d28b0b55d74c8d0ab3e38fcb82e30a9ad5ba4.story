A woman who discovered her ex-boyfriend had set up a dating website profile took revenge by hiring a removal firm to empty his flat, a court has heard.

Corinna Finney was ordered to carry out community service after she admitted arranging for Brian Waite's possessions to be removed, leaving him to come home to a bare flat.

However, after walking free from Swindon Magistrates' Court she insisted she did not regret what she did to her estranged lover.

Complaint: Finney, pictured outside Swindon Magistrates' Court, claimed that her punishment was too harsh

Couple: Finney and Mr Waite dated for 18 months before splitting earlier this year

Finney, 39, had been in a relationship with Mr Waite for 18 months before the affair started to break down earlier this year.

She discovered that he had set up a profile on a dating website for over-40s, even though they were discussing whether to reconcile with each other.

On March 14, Mr Waite, 53, left his flat in Swindon, Wiltshire at 7.45am to spend the day watching the racing at the Cheltenham Festival.

Michelle Hewitt, prosecuting, said: 'Throughout the day he received numerous phone calls from the defendant asking what time he was going to be home.

'She had arranged for a man with a van to come round and the place was stripped bare of everything; the carpets, clothing, food and the fridge, the television, oven, cutlery, and his curtains - everything.'

Fury: The case of Finney's anger was this online dating profile on a website for over-40s

Action: The jilted lover hired a removal firm to empty out Mr Waite's flat, located in this building in Swindon

Mr Waite returned home at 8.15pm and was horrified to discover all of the items from inside his property had disappeared.

'He suspected the defendant and the police went to her address the next day but none of the property was recovered,' the prosecutor said.

'Fortunately, a lot of it was later recovered but some items, including his clothing, carpets and food were never recovered.'

The value of Mr Waite's lost belongings amounted to £950, according to Ms Hewitt.

In a victim impact statement read to the court, Mr Waite said he had returned to his flat after enjoying a day at the races.

'I was met with a shocking sight,' he said. 'The entire contents of my flat had been stripped out. Food had been stolen from the cupboards - I was literally left with the clothes I was wearing.

'When I opened the door to my flat, it was a shock I shall never forget. I just wanted to make a clean break from Corinna, without all of this hassle.

'I have no carpets, bed or clothing, all I had left were the clothes I was wearing - it is going to cost me a lot of money to replace it.'

Punishment: Finney was handed a 15-month community order despite being warned that she could face jail

Victim: Mr Waite says he lost possessions worth a total of nearly £1,000

Mr Waite immediately suspected Finney, who is unemployed and lives in Swindon, and after she was arrested she pleaded guilty to theft.

Gordon Hotson, mitigating, said that the defendant and Mr Waite had been trying to resolve issues in their relationship at the time of the offence.

'It came as a great shock to her to discover that behind her back he was still using dating-type websites, when they were trying to make a go of things,' he said.

'For some considerable time, she had been suffering considerable emotional difficulties and the discovery just caused her to snap.

'She wanted to do something that would affect him as she had been affected very badly by the discovery of his alleged infidelity.

'It was the last straw and she acted without properly thinking through the consequence of her actions.'

Defiant: Corinna Finney says she does not regret emptying out the flat of her ex-boyfriend Brian Waite

The magistrate told Finney she could have been given a prison sentence, but instead gave her a 15-month community order and told her to pay £560 in compensation to the victim.

Nigel Spinney, chair of the bench, told Finney: 'This was a serious offence, with some planning involved in organising a white van to come and remove all of this furniture.

'We could be sending you to prison today but we are not going to. In the circumstances, from what we have heard and read, we are going to give you a community order today.'

Speaking outside court, Finney refused to apologise and insisted that Mr Waite 'got what he deserved'.

She added: 'I'm still not sorry, not in the slightest. The court was a bit harsh, but I'm not sorry, you can print that.'
