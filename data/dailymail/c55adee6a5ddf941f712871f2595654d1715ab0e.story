There's another pitched battle taking place this summer and this time it is not on the field of play - betting agency Sportingbet taking aim at the Channel Nine cricket commentary team, in particular Ian Healy and James Brayshaw.

They've gone as far as providing a 'tip sheet' for viewers on the Sportingbet Twitter account, suggesting when viewers should switch on and when they should tune out.

And the sheet they've used appears to be the official Wide World of Sports 'Commentary Roster'.

The Wide World of Sport tweet letting everyone know about their commentary line-up for the third day of the first cricket Test in Adelaide

The tweet lodged on the account of betting agency Sportingbet, urging viewers by stroke of yellow highlighter, which commentary team members they should avoid

Everywhere the names of Brayshaw and Healy appear, so too does a stroke of the yellow highlight pen, with @Sportingbet advising: 'Find out when to avoid the Channel 9 cricket commentary today.'

The WWOS sheet had been provided as a tweet also, with the line: 'Your day is sorted with our expert Commentators!' 

There's been plenty of action on and off the field during the first Test of the summer

Cricket aficionados are watching on with interest as a betting agency and commentary team are at odds
