France's Socialist prime minister Manuel Valls recently renewed his calls for Roma communities to be deported because ‘they cannot integrate’

One person was shot dead and at least 12 seriously wounded after a fight broke out between Roma gypsies on an illegal camp site in France. 

The bloodbath took place on the outskirts of Toulouse, in the south west of the country, on Friday afternoon following a row about stealing electricity. 

It comes after the country’s Socialist prime minister Manuel Valls renewed his calls for Roma communities to be deported because ‘they cannot integrate’.

Major cities including Paris are full of gangs of the migrants who carry out all kinds of crimes, from robbery to muggings, often in broad daylight.

Commenting on the latest outbreak of violence, a Toulouse police spokesman said: ‘One family wanted control of a power supply illegally linked to the camp.

‘When another objected there was a mass brawl, with guns, knives and metal bars used. Two men were rushed to hospital, with one dying from gunshot wounds. The other is seriously hurt.

‘Others involved are suffering from serious injuries including knife wounds and ones caused by blows from iron bars. 

There have been around twelve arrests.’ Toulouse mayor Jean-Luc Moudenc has regularly called for the camp at Montaudran, on the south east outskirts of the city ‘to be shut down as soon as possible’. 

He said that many of those living there were behind crime sprees all over the city, with young children among those sent out to steal. 

It was first raided a year ago, with police making a number of arrests and confiscating stolen train cables and copper.

Mr Valls said this year that he stands by remarks calling for the country’s Roma communities to be expelled. 

He said few could ever integrate into French society and ‘the majority’ should be ‘sent back to the borders’.

Mr Valls has been criticised by human rights campaigners, the European Commission and and left-wing cabinet colleagues.

Amnesty International has called for a ban on forced evictions which saw more than 10,000 Roma evicted from temporary camps in the first half of this year.

It has said Mr Valls’ remarks were likely to ‘perpetuate stereotypes and encourage animosity’ among the approximately 20,000 Roma who have settled in France, mainly from Romania, Bulgaria and the former Yugoslavia.

But Mr Valls said he saw no reason to correct comments that Roma lifestyles were ‘clearly in confrontation’ with French ways of life.

‘I’ve got nothing to correct,’ he said. ‘My remarks only shock those who don’t know the subject.

‘The majority of Roma should be delivered back to the borders. We are not here to welcome these people’, adding: ‘It’s not France’s job to deal with the misery of the whole world.’
