David Weir seemed a little embarrassed when told he had joined Daley Thompson, Sally Gunnell and Linford Christie by completing track and field’s grand slam of Olympic or Paralympic, world, European and Commonwealth titles.

‘I’m still just Dave from the Roundshaw council estate in London,’ he said following his victory in the T54 1500m at Hampden Park on Thursday. ‘But it is the best feeling ever. This was what made me not retire after the London 2012 Paralympic Games; the feeling of getting another medal.

‘If I didn’t do it, it would haunt me for the rest of my life. It is a fantastic feeling to make your country proud.’

Always on top: David Weir made it a track and field grand slam at Hampden Park with another win

Wave: Weir is still as passionate as ever and his emotion was appreciated by the crowd at Hampden Park

Weir remains the unassuming family man who transforms into a fierce competitor on the track and still remembers to dedicate victory to his son Mason, who turned three yesterday.

Athletes can be hesitant to talk about their pride in representing their country for, as Sir Bradley Wiggins put it, ‘you’re not really allowed to support England now’, but not Weir. He is unashamedly patriotic about wearing an England vest. The same applies to representing Great Britain and Weir  has pledged to try to carry on until the next Paralympics in 2016.

The ‘Weirwolf’ will be 37 by then; a far cry from the 17-year-old who quit athletics after the Atlanta Games in 1996, disillusioned by the way paralympic athletes were treated.

Now para-sport events enjoy equal billing at these Commonwealth Games. The reception Weir received was just as passionate as the guttural roar that accompanied Scotland’s Eilidh Child winning silver in the 400m hurdles later that night.

It was cold, wet and horrible at Hampden on Thursday night and yet it was still Weir, in his old-fashioned leather and suede gloves that mean his rivals cannot hear him coming before he bursts past them, who had the experience and fitness to navigate the puddles and make a decisive charge for the line with 300m to go.

Easy does it: Weir made a late dash in the last 300m to take yet another gold to add to his trophy cabinet

Wheelchair racing is also a strong, competitive and fascinating sport, with athletes of the calibre of Australia’s 11-time Paralympic medallist Kurt Fearnley in the Commonwealth Games and Weir’s great rival Marcel Hug at the European Championships in Swansea next month.

And yet, time and time again, Weir comes out on top over a range of distances from 400m to the marathon. In winning his first Commonwealth title, ‘Just Dave’ really has cemented his place among the greats.

Bring it on: Weir will have his opponents waiting for the day he retires as he leads the field yet again
