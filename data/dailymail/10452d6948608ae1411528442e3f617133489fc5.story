An ex-van driver from Wolverhampton has been crowned the king of Elvis Presley tribute acts.

Gordon Elvis' talent for impersonating his idol has taken him from Black Country karaoke bars to the spiritual home of all Presley fans - Graceland.

The 28-year-old - who changed his surname by deed poll in honour of the rock and roll icon - travelled all the way to Memphis, Tennessee, where he saw off competition from 250 other acts to be named the world's best Elvis impersonator.

Career change: Gordon Elvis, 28, used to deliver beer barrels to pubs in his native Malta before he moved to the West Midlands and became a tribute artist

Judges at the contest praised Mr Elvis' authentic walk and mannerisms as well as his singing voice.

'The judges said when I walked on stage I was Elvis,' he said.

'The way I walked and moved the microphone from hand to hand and my singing.'

The only thing Gordon - who is originally from Malta and now lives in Bilston - struggles to emulate is Elvis Presley's famous southern drawl.

'I am from Malta so my accent is obviously nothing like Elvis,' he said.

'And the fact that I have lived in the Black Country for four years means I have a Midlands accent as well.'

The tribute artist has come a long way from delivering beer barrels to pubs back home in Malta - his occupation before he moved to the Black Country in 2008 to pursue singing full time.

Gordon had been crooning Elvis songs since he was a toddler, and after wowing audiences with his renditions of the legend's famous hits at a karaoke night in Malta, he decided to move to Britain and chase his dreams.

'Malta is a very small place and I wanted to sing Elvis songs to a much wider audience,' he said.

'I knew the only way to do this full-time was to move to Britain.

'The work is very different in Malta - it's a small island so my act would only really be for the tourists. I did karaoke and people were encouraging me.

'A guy in a karaoke bar was saying I should impersonate Elvis for a living and I thought, why not?'

After arriving in the UK Mr Elvis, who is engaged to fiancee Louise Spiteri, entered a contest for Elvis tribute acts in Porthcawl, Wales, and won, spurring him on to continue impersonating his idol.

Gordon, who is engaged to fiancee Louise Spiteri, 27, went on to build up a repertoire of more than 350 Elvis songs as he performed in pubs and clubs around the West Midlands - along with an impressive wardrobe of rhinestone-encrusted jumpsuits.

His dedication to his craft has served him in good stead as he was named winner of the 26th annual Images of the King World Championships in Tennessee last month.

The 28-year-old said he was 'very proud'.
