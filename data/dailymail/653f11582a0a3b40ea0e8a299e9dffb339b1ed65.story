Five men are in intensive care after they were shot outside a church in Uptown, Chicago.

The Baptist church had been hosting a soup kitchen for the homeless and was in the process of serving meals to more than 100 people when the men were shot outside.

Three of the men were members of a local gang and it is believed the incident was a hit by a rival group, but ‘at least two’ of the victims had been at the charity meal.

Scene: The five men were gunned down at the bus stop outside Uptown Baptist Church which was holding a meal-service for homeless

The men, aged from 21 to 58, were standing at a bus stop near the church and were wounded by a round of bullets with a suspected assault weapon around 6pm Monday.

'We heard the barrage of shots outside.

There must have been at least 15 to 20 shots fired, and then after that, I went out to find out what was going on, and just saw carnage at the base of the church steps,’ Pastor Michael Allen of Uptown Baptist Church told CBS local.

According to witnesses a white car drove up to the bus stop and fired several rounds of bullets.

Pastor Allen said he believed ‘at least two or three’ victims had either just left his charity meal prayer service or were on the way there.

The pastor said he had served over 100 people in need on Monday night and stepped outside to find the victims in pools of blood on the church doorstep.

‘I heard what I thought was fireworks,’ witness Joe Rogers told CBS.

‘I see three people down on the ground; one on his back, one on his side, and one is face down.’

The church is located on the border between two gang territories and police say three different gangs in the Uptown area have been fighting for power of its streets.

Police have yet to arrest anyone for Monday’s shooting.

The victims’ conditions ranged from extremely critical to critical to good, the Chicago Fire Department said in on Twitter.
