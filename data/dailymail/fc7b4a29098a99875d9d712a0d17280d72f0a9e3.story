MATCH CONDITIONS

In Manaus there could be thunderstorms, the temperature will be around 30°C and the humidity will be very high. The other concern is the grass. In Brazil, it is thicker and longer which changes the speed of the ball.

The side that dictates the tempo of the game can gain the upper hand. If you play a lot of short passes it can  tire you out, so you need to be  able to move the ball firmly, quickly and most importantly accurately.

We know Andrea Pirlo and Daniele De Rossi have those qualities but Steven Gerrard will be key. He can hit 40 to 50-metre passes with accuracy and they could prove decisive if England capitalise on the pace they have up front. Whoever gains the best control here can be the winner.

Hot and humid: Temparatures will be over 30°C in Manaus, so whoever gains control of the game will be key

Shaping up: Steven Gerrard can be that main man for England against Italy in the World Cup Group D clash

HOW THEY SHAPE UP

England have been looking at 4-2-3-1 and 4-3-3, sometimes even shaping as a 4-4-2. The key components remain the same — Gerrard anchors the midfield, whoever is alongside him covers when he steps forward and they keep  a fluidity in the movement of the front four.

The problem is Italy are not easy to predict. They are really good at adapting themselves to suit their opponents’ shape. They have looked most comfortable with a line of five in defence, as in with a midfielder sitting deep, yet they played 4-3-3 in the friendly against Fluminense and scored five.

They have players who are attuned to different systems and tactically very good. Cesare Prandelli has kept the roots of Italian football in that they are strong in defence but they have such quality in front of them that they put greater emphasis on attack now than maybe  previous Italian sides.

Ciro Immobile and Lorenzo Insigne, who plays for me at Napoli, were up front together in Italy’s training session on Wednesday and Marco  Verratti returned from injury. That may give an indication of how a 4-3-3 may start against England with Antonio Candreva supporting the attack.

Tactical nous: Italy have the ability to change their tactics to suit the game under Cesare Prandelli

PERPLEXING PIRLO

Stop Pirlo and you win the game. That’s what you hear but I’m afraid it’s not that easy. In Italy teams go man to man on Pirlo when they play Juventus. Yet Juventus have other good players who can develop the game.

Even then Pirlo has such experience and intelligence that you normally see him, little by little, finding more space as the game goes on. Juventus showed statistics this week that he has passed the ball 11,551 times in 11,344 minutes.

Italy have De Rossi too who is able to move teams around. It helps if your forwards stifle  the supply but England have enough quality to make Italy worry about them rather than all focus on Pirlo. Gerrard can dominate, Frank Lampard is clever at finding pockets of space if he plays and the others in front must use intelligent movement.

Key player: If England stop Andrea Pirlo, they can win the game on Saturday night

SET-PIECES

Potentially, with two fairly equal sides, this could be the determining part of the game. Gerrard and Lampard, two players I know well, have great accuracy and success rate whether with crosses or  goals. The pace and delivery  on a moist surface is  absolutely key.

Pirlo scored seven goals from free-kicks last season if you include his final one against Cagliari so is an obvious danger but Mario Balotelli is very strong too.

Strong: Mario Balotelli could be a danger from set-pieces should he feature

and THE PITCH?

The images of the Manaus pitch don’t look good. The patches of sand, interspersed with the long grass, it means the ball will not run true and will bobble. The dryness slows the ball so it puts more emphasis on accuracy of pass and speed.

Doesn't look good: Quick passing will be key on a poor Manaus pitch which is sure to see the ball bobble

Control of the Group D game in the heat of Manaus will be key

Italy are capable of mixing up their tactics to suit the opposition

If England stop Pirlo they could win their opener in Brazil

The pitch may be an issue, so the speed of the passing is key
