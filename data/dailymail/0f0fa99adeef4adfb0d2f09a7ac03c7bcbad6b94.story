A ‘miracle’ baby who was born at just 24 weeks and spent the first year of his life in hospital is finally thriving.

Doctors would not have attempted to save Aiden McLaughlin, who weighed less than 1lb 5oz when he was born, if his birth had come just days earlier.

Aiden’s father, Sean, who lives with his wife Kelly and Aiden, now 18 months old, in Middlesbrough, said: ‘Everything had been going fine during Kelly’s pregnancy.

Aiden McLaughlin was born at 24 weeks weighing just 1lb 5oz and his parents, Sean and Kelly, were warned he might not survive. They family are pictured with nurse Angela Reay (back)

‘On Friday 13, in July 2012, she started bleeding and lost a clot and we actually thought it was the baby.’

The panic-stricken couple called an ambulance which took them to Middlesbrough’s James Cook University Hospital.

It wasn’t until they were at the hospital that they were told the baby was still safe.

Mrs McLaughlin was given two lots of steroid injections to help develop Aiden’s lungs in case he made an early arrival.

‘It was a massive relief to find out that the baby was OK,’ said Mr McLaughlin.

‘We actually also found out that Kelly was 2cm dilated.’

Aiden was born on July 16, 2012, at just 24 weeks and three days as doctors could not halt Mrs McLaughlin’s labour.

Mr McLaughlin said: ‘They said to us that the baby would be out in 24 hours. They also said that the baby might not make it through.

‘They had to give him oxygen to try and make him breathe.

‘Three minutes into doing it we heard a little cry.

‘It was just overwhelming as everything had been quiet up until that point.

‘It was like looking at Tom Thumb. It was just a little miracle that he was there.’

Aiden was rushed for neonatal intensive care and spent 15 weeks there before being discharged.

After a year in hospital, Aiden has finally been allowed to go home and he is now learning to walk and talk

However, he was back within days due because he developed a chest infection.

Investigations also found he had a hole in his heart which meant he required an operation at Newcastle’s Freeman Hospital in December before he could return to James Cook.

‘Our life was in the hospital with our baby just trying to get him home,’ said Mr McLaughlin, who along with his wife cares for Aiden full time.

In February, while still in the hospital, Aiden was struck with bronchiolitis – a lower respiratory tract infection that usually affects babies and very young children.

‘We were actually told to prepare ourselves for the worst,’ said Mr McLaughlin.

‘They did say to us that we might have to make a choice to leave the machine on or turn it off.

‘But we thought “it’s a life and we’re in it for the long term”.’

Thankfully, Aiden responded well to treatment and by March he was starting to be prepared for his release from hospital which finally took place on July 3, 2013.

Mrs McLaughlin said: ‘To look at him you wouldn’t know the problems he has had. You would think he was a “normal” 18-month-old.

‘He’s crawling and he can hold himself up on his feet.

‘He’ll say “mum” and “dad”. We are just so proud of him.’
