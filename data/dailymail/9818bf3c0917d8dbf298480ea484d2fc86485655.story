Prolific: The profile photo of Abu Layth, AKA 20-year-old Anil Khalil Raoufi, on Twitter

Just a few years ago he was a normal western teenager who loved cars and was keen to become a mechanic.

But yesterday, former University student Anil Khalil Raoufi, 20, was named as the latest Briton to be killed while fighting with Islamist fanatics in Syria.

Neighbours have told how the ‘friendly’ teenager with dreams of becoming a mechanic had been ‘dramatically’ radicalised in just a few years.

He dropped out of a mechanical engineering course at Liverpool University, swapped his western clothes for full islamic dress.

He even stopped speaking to non-muslim friends if he passed them in the street, they said.

Raoufi’s actions are thought to have stunned his family, who raised him in an affluent Manchester suburb near where his father owned a restaurant business.

One source said his family did not even know he had travelled to Syria to fight - let alone been killed.

Yesterday anti-terrorist police were searching his family’s home after Raoufi was unmasked as the fighter whose nom de guerre was Abu Layth.

The 20-year-old was regarded as a key figure in recruiting Britons to fight for Al Qaeda-linked militant groups in Syria until his death earlier this month.

Posting on a Twitter account under the name ‘Abu Layth’, he penned a graphic accounts of the country’s brutal civil war online after leaving his home last year.

He even referred on Twitter to being caught in a firefight as ‘like a scene from Star Wars’ as bullets ‘zinged’ inches over his head.

In one of his online entries, he described al-Qaeda as ‘a beautiful thing’.

The second oldest son of four children, the keen amateur boxer - who only turned 20 earlier this month - had an older brother Naveed, a pharmacist in Manchester, a sister, Naveeda, 22, and a younger brother.

The £250,000 three-bedroom semi-detached house in the affluent suburb of Didsbury is a short distance from two restaurants run by his father.

A local resident said his mother Kamala was ‘a lovely, lovely woman, completely part of the street’s life, not at all isolated, since the day they arrived’. ‘I’m really shocked,’ she added.

His family were in hiding yesterday, but neighbours said that when Raoufi was about 17 he changed from being popular high school student with many non-Muslim friends and a car-obsessed ‘pistonhead’ to an Islamist radical.

‘It was quite dramatic,’ said one. ‘He went from being quite a friendly boy who would say hello in the street to someone who would ignore you.

‘He began wearing long robes and Muslim cap and grew a beard. No-one knew why because his family weren’t really religious at all.’

Another said: ‘Growing up, Anil was just like any other lad. He loved his cars and was always talking about them.

‘I think he wanted to become a mechanic and he was studying locally with the aim of taking it up as a career. He swapped and changed his cars a lot - the last one was a silver BMW.’

Workers at nearby Didsbury Mosque said he was not well-known there, and he is understood to have been recruited to become a jihadi in Syria after becoming further radicalised through Internet contact with committed Islamists.

He is understood to have travelled to Syria to join another Briton, Iftikhar Jaman, a 23-year-old call centre worker from Portsmouth who was himself later killed fighting with the rebels.

Raoufi joined up with the feared Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham militant group blamed for many atrocities and is understood to have led a brigade of British fighters, posing for photographs with weaponry including an anti-aircraft gun.

Raoufi is understood to have been shot in the head during a clash with a rival rebel group earlier this month.

Terrorism expert Neil Doyle said: ‘He was one of the most visible British fighters in Syria and seems to have played a key role recruiting fellow Islamists who wanted to join extremist groups fighting the Assad regime.

‘But from his postings on Twitter he seems to have been caught up with infighting between different rebel factions and to have achieved very little by way of actually helping the Syrian people.’ Shocked former schoolfriends yesterday posted tributes online.

One, Naomi Stark, wrote: ‘RIP Anil, you were always so funny and friendly in high school.’

But Twitter ‘Marvi’ wrote: ‘Upsetting hearing about Anil, he was a real soldier, he did what most of us could not imagine doing.

‘Died whilst protecting others.’ Detective Chief Inspector Will Chatterton, of the North West Counter-Terrorism Unit, said his officers were ‘providing support to the family’ and ‘speaking to them to understand how a man from the North West came to be reportedly killed in Syria’.

He urged anyone with information about Britons travelling to Syria to take part in the fighting to contact police.
