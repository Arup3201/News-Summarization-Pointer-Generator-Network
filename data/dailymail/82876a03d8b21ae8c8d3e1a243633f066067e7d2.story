A white man has been arrested on suspicion of daubing racist graffiti across a hairdresser's door and writing notes telling her to leave her new home as the area was 'for black sisters and brothers'.

Samantha Sunter, 24, had taken her two young sons to see their new flat in Willenhall, Coventry, when she found the front door covered in graffiti, anti-vandal paint and faeces.

A letter had also been pushed through the door telling her: 'Willenhall is black so f*** off' while another note put on her door read: 'Black Power. Don't stay to long or else...'

The hairdresser found the note - which also had a gun drawn on it and the word 'obinyo', a Nigerian slang word for a white person - when moving into her home last Monday with sons Harvey, two and five-year-old Oscar.

The letter also stated 'Willenhall is black so f*** off' while another one put on her door read: 'Black Power. Don't stay to long or else...'

Further messages read: 'We are watching you white b****', and told her the area was 'black only.'

Ms Sunter has now fled the £360-a-month property as a result of the abuse and has been staying with her mother.

She is now waiting to move into another new home.  

Today, West Midlands Police said they had arrested a 54-year-old man in connection with the attacks.

He is understood to be white. 

A force spokesman said: 'A 54-year-old local man has been arrested on suspicion of racially aggravated criminal damage and was later released on police bail pending further inquiries.'

The man, who has not been named has been told to return to a police station in April.   

Shortly after the incident, West Midlands Police had said the incident was being taken 'very seriously'.

Housing association Whitefriars, which owns the flat, has confirmed there has also been a 'previous incident' at the address.

Speaking last week, Ms Sunter said she has lived in Willenhall for 15 years and has never experienced anything like this before.

'These people make Willenhall out to be some sort of ghetto,' she said.

'The whole point of this is that it's not right. I'm not going to sit there and take it.

'I had to have a police escort away from my property and I knew I was being watched.

'You hold your head up high but it's disgusting.

'Whitefriars were the first people I rang when this happened and when I spoke to someone they said they didn't think it would happen again.

'I think they have allowed this to happen. If it's happened before, and they have neglected to tell me, then they have put me and my children in danger.'

Police have made door-to-door inquiries while forensics experts are studying the note. Officers are also liaising with Whitefriars. 

Another note left on Ms Sunter's door read: 'Black Power. Don't stay to long or else...'

Further messages read: 'We are watching you white b****', and told Ms Sunter the area was 'black only.'

Carmel McCarthy, director of housing and neighbourhood services, said: 'We absolutely deplore the actions reported and are working closely with the police to identify the culprit and to press for the strongest possible actions to be taken against them.

'There had been a previous incident reported at the property, which we passed on to the police for investigation. We closely monitor these events and in this case it appeared to be a one-off incident.

'As soon as Ms Sunter drew this incident to our attention, we offered her another home, which she will be moving into shortly.

'We have been working closely with Ms Sunter and the police on this incident and will continue to do so.

'Whitefriars always seeks to take strong action against any and all hate crime and we have close links with the police who work with us to investigate and prosecute these types of incidents.'

Anyone with information should call police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.
