Ebola panic is swarming New York City as it emerged infected doctor Craig Spencer rode the subway, visited a crowded bowling hot spot and took an Uber cab just one day before he was rushed to the hospital with a 103F fever.

The Doctors Without Borders physician tested positive for the deadly virus seven days after returning from Guinea where he was treating Ebola patients.

But instead of steering clear of crowds, the 33-year-old last night took the subway from Harlem to Williamsburg, where he  visited The Gutter, before taking an Uber cab home.

Earlier yesterday, he went on a three-mile jog and took the subway to the High Line garden - a popular tourist destination - before eating out at a restaurant.

The terrifying details mean that residents in at least two dense New York City neighborhoods could have been exposed: Williamsburg and Harlem, where Spencer lives. 

New Yorkers have flooded Twitter in panic revealing their fears after visiting the bowling alley and taking the subway at the same time. 

One exclaimed: 'He took the subway from Harlem to Brooklyn?!?! YOU LITERALLY HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE ENTIRE CITY SUBWAY SYSTEM TO DO THAT'

Another said: 'Now that Ebola is here, I aint takin the subway no more...'

And one wrote: 'Son Ebola found it's way to NY? I'm sick'

Health officials confirmed Dr Spencer visited The Gutter, which cancelled its scheduled Thursday night gigs and closed its doors.

A panel briefing reporters on Dr Spencer's case said he rode the subway on Thursday night from north west Manhattan to Brooklyn.

He took the A train from 147th Street between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue down the west side of Manhattan. 

He then switched to the L train, which travels in a straight horizontal line across the island and under the East River into Brooklyn. 

 

Major route: He took the A train to 14th St-8th Ave, Manhattan, then took the L train to Bedford Avenue, Brooklyn

Gutter shuttered: The Gutter did not open on Thursday night and a band showcase was canceled

This is the route Dr Spencer took last night. During the day he also took the 1 train to the High Line and ate out

It's confirmed that the Ebola patient rode the A train and L line last night. Earlier in the day he took the 1 train to the High Line.

Spencer left his home at 147th Street between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue.

Spencer took the A at 145. He then got on the L train at 14th street.

He probably got off at Bedford Avenue then walked to The Gutter. 

Alighting at Bedford Avenue station, he then walked to The Gutter bowling alley. 

Earlier in the day he also went on a three-mile run, rode the 1 train, went to the High Line, and dined out. 

His fiancee and two friends are now under observation, and health officials will continue to interview Dr Spencer to determine if he came into contact with anyone else who may need to be monitored for signs of Ebola. 

Although police taped off his apartment block on 147th St in Harlem, and barred anybody from going inside, officials insist residents are not at risk of contracting the disease. 

Dr Thomas Frieden, president of the CDC, told the panel: 'Our concern now is with healthcare workers who are caring for him.

'By coincidence, we already have a team on the ground at Bellevue that has been reviewing the preparations and observing the hospital working. 

'We have another team on the way now.

'I also wish to reiterate the case of Mr Duncan in Dallas. Even his household contacts who were with him for several days after he got sick did not get the disease. It is a scary disease but it does not spread easily.' 

Owners of the outlet will now be working to determine what Dr Spencer did at the bowling alley - whether he rented shoes, for instance, or shared a drink.

Ebola can be contracted from contact with the bodily fluids including sweat of an infected person only when victims are symptomatic, with the infectiousness increasing as the victim's condition worsens.  

The Gutter did not open its doors on Thursday and canceled a scheduled band showcase but staff made no mention of Ebola.

October 23, 8.30pm: Dr Spencer's test comes back positive for Ebola

The closure was blamed on 'unforeseen circumstances' as reporters began to flock to the establishment into Thursday night.

Reporters had flocked to the shuttered doors of The Gutter by Thursday evening, but no one in hazmats suits had yet to appear. 

Dr Spencer flew to Africa on September 18 to treat patients in Guinea with non-profit organization Doctors Without Borders.

Flying out, Dr Spencer tweeted a picture of himself wearing a full yellow hazmat suit and face mask with the message: 'Off to Guinea with Doctors Without Borders (MSF).

'Please support organizations that are sending support or personnel to West Africa, and help combat one of the worst public health and humanitarian disasters in recent history.'

On October 16, he checked in at a hotel in Brussels, Belgium, on his return journey from Guinea to the U.S.

He arrived at JFK on October 17 where he was screened for the disease. 

Health officials tonight insisted Dr Spencer felt no symptoms - aside from fatigue - until he awoke with a fever at around 10am on Thursday.

He then contacted the health department and was taken in to Bellevue for testing. 

The NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene said on Thursday: 'EMS HAZ-TAC Units transported a patient to Bellevue Hospital who presented a fever and gastrointestinal symptoms.

'The patient is a health care worker who returned to the U.S. within the past 21 days from one of the three countries currently facing the outbreak of this virus.'

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo assembled at Bellevue Hospital following the the positive test results.

'Today testing confirmed that a patient here in New York City has tested positive or Ebola,' began Mayor de Blasio.

The mayor said that being near someone in places like a subway car does not put someone at risk because 'Ebola is an extremely difficult disease to get.'

'Every hospital in the city is prepared in the event other patients come forward,' said de Blasio.

Governor Cuomo hit on many of the same points, but admitted this case did not come as a surprise.

[We were] hoping that it didn't happen but also realistic,' Cuomo said. 'We can't say this is unexpected.'

Governor Cuomo revealed that four people were considered potentially exposed to Dr. Spencer 'during the relevant period.'

'We're already in contact with the four people,' the governor said.
