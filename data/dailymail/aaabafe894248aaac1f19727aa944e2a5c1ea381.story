Recipe for success: Dame Helen Ghosh is serving up a treat to Home Office staff

Civil servants working for the Home Office are being baked cupcakes and served tea by the department's permanent secretary in a bid to boost morale.

Staff are told they are doing a good job over afternoon tea with Dame Helen Ghosh, who has admitted she even bakes the treats herself - with a little help from Domestic Goddess Nigella Lawson, whose recipe has become her 'speciality'.

The tea party rewards the best Home Office team every month, and is part of a drive to boost morale and reconnect senior civil servants to grass roots services, it was reported.

She told The Times: 'They come and have tea with me and I make cakes. They love it that senior management cares enough to make some cakes and that they get immediate thanks.

'I do like cooking because it is one of the really creative things I have time to do.

'It is something I learnt as a child. Nigella Lawson's cappuccino cupcakes are my speciality.'

As well as rewarding hard work, Dame Helen told The Times that the tea parties were also designed to let people in the department get to know their leaders.

She said people liked leaders to be 'visible' and that 'visible leadership was getting out and talking to people'.

Senior civil servants will also be ordered to spend time with police officers, walking the beat with them, to gain a greater understanding of life on the front line.

Home Office officials will also join staff at airport passport controls and also teams working in towns and cities who are tackling gang and drug problems.

Senior staff in the department are expected to spend up to five days a year on the front line, Dame Helen added, but the scheme could be extended to include all staff.

It is hoped the exercise will give officials the chance to see the impact Government policies have on front line services.

Dame Helen, who has herself spent time with immigration officials at Heathrow and has accompanied police on the beat, believes the move will provide a better insight into problems than Whitehall-produced policy papers.
