Drug smuggler Michaella McCollum has revealed how she watches DVDs, dances, listens to music and has eaten heart while in prison in Peru.

Michaella, 20, made the revelations about her lifestyle behind bars, in a series of hand-written letters to her family. She's also taking cookery lessons.

She said she is woken each day at 6am for a cold shower and cleaning duties but has 10 hours of free time daily and life is not as terrible as her family feared it would be.

In one note to her sister Samantha, published in Closer magazine today she said: 'We get to watch a DVD today and I get so happy and excited about that. Such small things now make me so happy.

'I now have a digital radio - a girl called Patty gave it to me. I haven't had my earphones off since, music makes me happy and is a sort of escape.

'Next week, there are lots of dance activities that we all have to take part in, which will be fun and a good way to pass the time.'

Michaella is in a severely overcrowded prison where many inmates sleep on floors.

She was caught smuggling 1.5million-pounds worth of cocaine into Peru along with 20-year-old Melissa Reid from Lenzie, near Glasgow.

The pair were jailed for six years and eight months after admitting smuggling charges at a hearing last month.

In another note to her family in 
Dungannon, Northern Ireland, Michaella wrote: 'On Halloween, we had this
 huge event in the prison with a parade where we all prayed and there 
were priests and people carrying a big statue.

'It lasted all day, then we had a feast and ate heart. That's their nice tradition. It was actually nice.'Michaella
 added: 'I'm doing really good now, anytime I feel down or bad or have 
negative thoughts, I quickly move them to one side, allowing only good 
to pass.

'I think I am as happy as I can be in this situation.'

Her
 sister Samantha told Closer magazine her family send Michaella Â£100 a 
month which means she can buy bottled water, toilet roll and shampoo.

They also send her books and magazines and food like porridge and noodles. The normal prison diet is rice and beans.

Michaella
 and Melissa were arrested in Peru in August last year as they were 
about to board a flight to Madrid carrying over 10kg of cocaine.

Initially they claimed they didn't know they had the drugs on them but later changed their story to say they were forced into being 'mules' for a gang.

After changing their plea to guilty, in December the girls were sentenced to six years and eight months in jail for drug trafficking.

Michaella's lawyer is now pressing to have her transferred to a UK jail within the next year. He hopes both girls will also be eligible for parole within two years.

They are being held in a windowless cell with two other women in Virgen De Faitma jail in Peru.
