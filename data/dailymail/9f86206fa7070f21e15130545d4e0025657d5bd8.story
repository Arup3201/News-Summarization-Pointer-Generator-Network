There is no doubting the skill and craftsmanship of his artwork.

But Simon Beck’s masterpieces aren’t created with a paintbrush or easel.

Instead, the 56-year-old’s canvases are the sprawling ski slopes of the Alps, and he creates his intricate patterns by running in snowshoes across the snow.

Simon Beck has spent the past decade decorating the mountain range with his spectacular artworks, which can measure up to 100m x 100m – the size of two football pitches

The artist has spent the past decade decorating the mountain range with his spectacular artworks, which can measure up to 100m x 100m – the size of six football pitches.

It means that Mr Beck can cover a total of more than 25 miles during each piece of work.

Each image takes up to 12 hours to design and make, with Simon currently produces about 30 snow drawing each year.

His work has also led him to publish a book of his designs, inspired an underwear range, and seen him branch out into etching drawings on beaches.

The artist favours a level site with a depth of about nine inches of powdery snow to make sure his art looks best in photographs, which he takes from either an aircraft, summit or a ski lift

His most intricate designs include the Koch snowflake, a Sierpinski triangle as well as abstract cubes and spirals.

He uses an orienteering compass to create the perfect geometric designs.

Each pattern is crafted by Mr Beck alone in the skiing town of Les Arcs, in the French Alps, where he lives during winter.

Mr Beck, went to Millfield School and studied engineering at Oxford university. In 1974 he won the British Orienteering Championships.

He has spent most of his adult life working as a freelance orienteering mapmaker and has now created around 175 designs after ploughing his first at Christmas in 2004.

Mr Beck, who studied Engineering Science at Oxford University, said many of his patterns can equal the effort needed to climb halfway up Mont Blanc

His work has proved so popular that New Zealand clothes label Icebreaker launched The Art of Nature Simon Beck Collection – a range of undergarments inspired by his designs.

He uses what he describes as a 'kind of reverse orienteering' to plot his intricate paths before walking along the route in a pair of snowshoes.

Most of Mr Beck's patterns are crafted in the skiing town of Les Arcs, in the French Alps, where he lives during winter

He said: 'The main reason for making them was because I can no longer run properly due to problems with my feet, so plodding about on level snow is the least painful way of getting exercise.

Mr Beck said many of his patterns can equal the effort needed to climb halfway up Mont Blanc.

He first plans out the pattern on graph paper, then surveys the site and judges where the major points of the design should be, and starts at one of those points.

From the centre he calculates the distance to the other points and walks out and back from the centre using either pace counting or a measuring tape to determine the number of steps he needs to take.

The artist favours a level site with a depth of about nine inches of powdery snow to make sure his art looks best in photographs, which he takes from either an aircraft, summit or a ski lift. The designs only last until the next heavy snowfall.

He added: 'I usually keep at it until I get too tired, using a headlamp if it gets dark first. It takes typically until I can't go on, but that can depend.

'The setting-out serves as the warm-up then the real training is completing the design. Once this second stage is started, I put on my personal stereo.'

The artist from Bracknell, Berkshire added: 'Most of the time I travel round the Alps and hike up mountains, aiming to be on the summit at sunset for good photos.

‘My feet are in a bad way but if I can keep my weight off the front of my feet things are not too bad.

'Often I am copying designs I have found, like crop circles or well-known mathematical figures, or repeating designs I have made earlier but failed to get good photos of.

'Some designs I am commissioned to do require a lot of study as to the best way to create it, and this process can take several hours.

‘The main danger is having a minor accident skiing down at night after I have finished drawing.

‘Or running out of steam, if you push yourself too hard at the end of it. It is quite frightening how quickly you can run out of steam.’
