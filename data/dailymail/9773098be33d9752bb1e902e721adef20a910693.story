Victim: Blonde presenter Alex Lovell was stalked by James Connolly after he appeared on Channel 5's Brain Teaser game show

A quiz show contestant who stalked the programme's presenter has been barred from harassing her on Facebook and Twitter.

James Connolly, 50, had been banned from contacting BBC newsreader Alex Lovell in December 2007 after bombarding her with emails, but had applied to have the ban lifted at Bristol Magistrates Court.

Instead judges imposed a stricter ban on Connolly which prevents him using social media sites to contact her.

Connolly told the court he only started contacting Alex, 39, when he received 'numerous anonymous prank phone calls' after appearing on Channel 5's Brain Teaser quiz show in 2004.

He believed they were from the blonde presenter and then repeatedly emailed her for three years until she obtained an indefinite restraining order.

Connolly, of Nottingham, said: 'As what I was receiving was anonymous, what I gave back was sometimes anonymous.

'When the original harassment case was brought against me I pleaded guilty because I was sorry that I had upset her.'

He told the court that the ban was causing him problems explaining: 'I want to go to America to visit my cousin, but with the restraining order being against a celebrity, and connected to the BBC, I don't think the American authorities would look at me in a kind light.

'I believe that my passport has some kind of marker on it - I go to see my mum and dad in Ireland from Holyhead and my car always gets searched.

'I know that I will still have a criminal record but this restraining order is known to police as an 'active court order' and seems to mean they stop me more.

'I feel like the order is a Sword of Damocles hanging over me.'

Alex - who became a presenter on BBC Points West in 2005 - prepared a victim impact statement saying that she wanted the order kept in place, because it was clearly working.

Prosecutor Chris Holland said: 'She believes the order hanging over him prevents him from contacting her because of the serious repercussions.

'The "Sword of Damocles", as Connolly calls it, prevents him from making further contact with her.

'She makes the point that if this order was removed it would involve significant unpleasant and difficult security arrangements having to be put in place.'

Mr Holland said the original order - imposed in December 2007 - was 'antiquated'.

He asked magistrates to reimpose the restraining order but update it to include social media like Twitter and Facebook.

Magistrates agreed and imposed the updated order indefinitely.
