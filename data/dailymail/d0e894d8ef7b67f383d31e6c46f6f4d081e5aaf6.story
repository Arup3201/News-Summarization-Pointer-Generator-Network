Stabbed to death: Hassan Mahmood, 15, pictured in the park in Birmingham yesterday hours before he was killed

A 15-year-old boy was stabbed to death in a park while standing up for his girlfriend who had been abused on Facebook, it was claimed today.

Hassan Mahmood was attacked in South Yardley, Birmingham, last night following an argument between two groups of youths.

Friends of the schoolboy claimed he was defending his girlfriend when he was knifed.

Today police are questioning two 16-year-olds, a 15-year-old and a 17-year-old on suspicion of murder.

Paramedics
rushed to scene yesterday after the fight broke out. A large 
area near Oaklands Park remained cordoned off today while police investigate.

Detective Inspector Tom Chisholm, who 
is leading the investigation, said: 'We are aware that there were groups
of young people in the area, some of whom may have left the scene 
before the police arrived.

'There
is some suggestion that this was a fight which has tragically gone too 
far. I would ask that people who were in the park or anyone else with 
information to contact us immediately.'

Police said there was no indication that the killing was gang related.

A friend, who was at the scene today, said teenage 'banter' suddenly turned into violence.

'It was a fight that got out of hand,' they said.

'Apparently another lad wrote something nasty on Facebook about his girlfriend and he found out and challenged him.

'It started out as a bit of banter but spiralled and someone pulled a blade. I wasn't there but I know people who were. Hassan was just sticking up for her and got killed for it. It's wrong.

'I think the lad said his girlfriend was a s*** or something like that.'

Dozens of messages of condolence have been posted on a memorial site set up for Hassan and flowers have been left at the scene where he died.

Other friends had paid tribute to the tragic teenager online, and they said that Facebook had been the trigger for the fight.

A friend wrote: 'It's patetic if what ave 
just read from one of the close friends to this young lads uncle..who 
says the young lad was murdered due to an argument that escalated over 
Facebook..then I think these social websites need to be band.'

And another said: 'Apparently it was over an argument that broke out on FB. May God bless him.'

Hassan's uncle Sajid Ramzan, 32, said: 'We've heard a lot of different rumours some about a girlfriend, others about an argument.

'I've heard about a dispute over Facebook which might have caused the fight but I don't know any more than that. As far as we knew he was going to the gym when he left.

'He had his gym bag with him when he 
walked out of the door. We don't know what happened after that. No-one 
has ever heard of anyone having a grudge or a problem with Hassan.

'And he's never been involved with 
any kind of trouble before. He's not a nuisance or a troublemaker, he 
wasn't that kind of boy. He will be very much missed, everybody loved 
him so much.

'His parents are shattered and devastated. He was a lovely, bright kid, he was well-known in the community as a polite child.'

A memorial page set up in memory of Hassan urged his friends not to retaliate following his murder and appealed for calm.

It read: 'I URGE ALL of Hassan's friends, NOT to take the law in their own hands.

'I know emotions are running high, we're living in a time of heightened tensions, but I appeal for calm as I'm sure that's what Hassan & his family would have wanted.'

A floodlit search of the area was conducted last night with further searches to be carried out today.

Roads in the area have been closed while specialist forensic scene investigators scoured the area for clues.

Det Insp Chisholm added: 'This was a tragic incident and our deepest condolences go out to the young man's family.

'A
murder investigation was immediately launched. We have a team of 
detectives working with local officers to gain an understanding of what 
happened.

'I would ask that people who were in the park or anyone else with information to contact us immediately.

'We
are very well experienced at supporting people who are reluctant to 
share important information which helps solve serious crimes like this. 
If anyone finds themselves in that position I would urge them to contact
me personally.'

Hassan's headteacher Sohail Aslam, from the Rightrack Independent School in Saltley, Birmingham, added: 'He was a recent addition to our school.

'He had been with us six weeks but had settled very quickly and was well-liked by all the staff and students.

'He was very respectful towards everybody, we'd had no problems and he had a bright future.'

He added that the teenager had been working towards his GCSEs and loved 'sports and singing'.

Mr Aslam said the school was considering some form of tribute to Hassan, in conjunction with the boy's family.
