The $1 million Benjamin Hampton had in the bank was supposed to buy him a new home.

But the Australian Federal Police officer had to hand over the sum to be bailed from Sydney's Central Local Court after being charged with a dozen corruption and bribery offences.

Hampton faces a long stint behind bars if convicted after a 15-month investigation into allegations he sold AFP secrets to a member of the public.

Prosecutors said Hampton was a flight risk and had booked return plane tickets to Slovenia, where his father lived.

'(He) was going to a country where there is no extradition with Australia,' the court heard on Thursday.

On top of the money, Magistrate Alexander Mijovich made Hampton surrender his passport and he had to report to police daily and avoid contact with others involved in the investigation.

A bribery conviction carries a penalty of up to 10 years' jail, while the other offences carry penalties of two to five years each.

Hampton faces two charges of receiving a bribe as a commonwealth public official, two charges of receiving a corrupting benefit and two counts of abuse of public office.

He also has been hit with four counts of unauthorised access to data with intent to commit a serious offence and two charges of divulging or communicating prescribed information.

Hampton's lawyer earlier said his client had more than $1 million in the bank, earned from the sale of his home.

'The money in the bank account was to be used to buy another property,' the court heard.

But it has now been used to buy Hampton freedom at least until his next hearing at the Downing Centre Local Court on November 11.

Hampton worked as a protection officer for the AFP and was suspended from duties in May.

At an earlier press briefing, AFP Sydney commander Ray Johnson said none of the alleged information sold endangered anyone or compromised any AFP investigation.

No one else has yet been charged over the allegations.

'Should it be proven, everyone [at the AFP] will be significantly disappointed,' Mr Johnson said.
