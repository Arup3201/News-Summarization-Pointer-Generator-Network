Two Ukrainian soldiers celebrated their wedding today in a doomed airbase just hours before it was violently stormed by Russian troops in armoured vehicles.

Lieutenants Galina Volosyanchik and Ivan Benera were pictured today at the Belbek base near the Crimean city of Sevastopol, as their comrades danced and raised cups of champagne in their honour.

But soon after gunfire and explosions could be heard as an armoured vehicle smashed through the gates of the military compound, heralding a struggle in which two officers were shot and wounded.

Meanwhile the Novofedorovka naval base was also taken over, which saw Ukraine hand over its only submarine to the Russian military.

Colonel Yuliy 
Mamchur, the commander of the base, said a Ukrainian serviceman had been
 injured and that he himself he was being taken away by the Russians for
 talks at an unspecified location.

Ukrainian defence ministry officials later confirmed to Fox News that a second man had been shot.

Earlier in the day, forces in the annexed Crimea region were in defiant mood, and had backed a lorry 
against the entrance to stop advancing forces.

The forces seemed unconcerned by the Russian troops surrounding the base earlier as they celebrated the nuptials of their young comrades.

New bride, medic Galina Volosyanchik, could be seen holding a bouquet of flowers, and walked hand-in-hand through the compound with her husband Ivan Benera, a communications officer.

Just hours later the gates would be forced open by an armoured vehicles, as soldiers flooded in and demanded surrender.

There were scenes of panic and chaos 
as people did not know whether soldiers were shooting at others or just 
firing warning shots.

An ambulance was seen driving to the base, but was not admitted inside, so two paramedics were pictured running.

A short time later, the vehicle was seen driving away with what appeared to be a wounded person inside.

After the base was taken over, the Ukrainian men gathered, sang the national anthem, then stood at ease.

It
 is the first time Russia has launched a full on assault on a base in 
the Crimea and now means only one or two Ukrainian strongholds are left 
in the region.

Earlier Russian troops surrounded the compound and issued an ultimatum for their opponents to surrender.

Colonel
 Yuli Mamchur was seen talking with Russian opponents as the deadline 
set for them to leave the base lapsed. He has now been taken away by 
Russian forces for questioning.

Earlier this week Ukraine started to withdraw its 
troops from Crimea to the mainland amid fears Russia plans further 
military incursions into their territory after militiamen seized three 
Ukrainian ships.

Shots were fired and
 stun grenades as the Ukrainian corvette Khmelnitsky was seized in 
Sevastopol while another ship, the Lutsk, was also surrounded by 
pro-Russian forces.

Ukrainian servicemen were also seen disembarking a third ship, the 
Ternopil corvette. There were not thought to be any casualties, however.

The action came hours
 before European Union leaders agreed to widen the list of Russian 
officials subject to personal sanctions over the seizure of Crimea - 
while asking the European Commission to prepare for broader economic 
sanctions if the crisis escalates.

Troops at the base are not said to be heavily armed, but instead readied themselves with sticks and metal pipes.

The
 Russian takeover of the Black Sea peninsula has been largely bloodless,
 though one Ukrainian serviceman was killed and two others wounded in a 
shooting in Simferopol earlier this week.

Ukraine's
 Defence Ministry said on Friday Crimea's bases were still formally 
under Ukrainian control, but most are now occupied by Russian troops and
 fly Russia's tricolour flag.

Two weeks ago, it was reported that snipers were positioned in the area surrounding the Belbek base.

The troops in the base have been waiting for orders as thousands of other troops are withdrawn from the region as tensions with Russia heighten

Yesterday ethnic Russians 
flooded the streets of Crimea as they celebrated the area's 
referendum to join with neighbouring Russia with fireworks and street 
parties.

Thousands 
revelled in Simferopol, the capital of Crimea, where the population is 
around 58 per cent ethnic Russia.

Soldiers at the Belbek base looked distraught as they received the news of the Moscow 
bill - regarded as illegal by the international community.

Elsewhere more than 5,000 pro-Russia residents demonstrated in the eastern city of Donetsk demonstrated on Saturday in favor of holding a referendum on whether to seek to split off and become part of Russia.Â 

Russian President Vladimir Putin has 
said there is no intention to move into eastern Ukraine, but the 
prospect of violence between pro- and anti-secession groups in the east 
could be used as a pretext for sending in troops.

Eastern
 Ukraine is the heartland of Ukraine's economically vital heavy industry
 and mining.

It's also the support base for Viktor Yanukovych, the 
Ukrainian president who fled to Russia last month after three months of 
protests in the capital, Kiev, triggered by his decision not to sign an 
agreement with the European Union.
