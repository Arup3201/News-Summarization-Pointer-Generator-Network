They star in one of the most violent shows on TV, which regularly sees women  meet sticky ends at the hands of men or be married off to someone unpleasant against their will.

Now Game of Thrones stars Natalie Dormer and Lena Headey have thrown their support behind a new campaign to end violence against women and girls.

In powerful new photos taken for Plan UK's Because I Am A Girl campaign, the pair appear with a series of phrases, including 'bear the scars' and 'no longer myself', daubed on their cheeks.

Standing up for women: Game of Thrones and Hunger Games star Natalie Dormer in the new Plan UK campaign

The Because I Am A Girl campaign aims to help millions of girls in the world’s poorest communities live free from violence, particularly child marriage and FGM.

One girl is forced to marry every two seconds, while 130 million girls and women are living with the consequences of FGM worldwide.

'It fills me with hope that someday soon girls can grow up on a world that is free from these harmful practices,' said Headey who plays the manipulative Queen Cersei Lannister in Game of Thrones.

'I urge everyone – men, boys, women and girls – to join me in standing up for girls’ rights’ with Plan UK.'

Her co-star Natalie Dormer added: 'I believe we all have a part to play in the fight to end abuses like FGM and child marriage.

'It’s a powerful stance that we’re all taking, and by uniting together we can help keep millions of girls safe from harm.'

The Game of Thrones pair were joined in the campaign by singer Beverley Knight who said she was horrified to discover how widespread child marriage, FGM and domestic abuse still are.

'Plan UK is working hard to end these harmful practices worldwide but the stories of these girls just aren’t being heard,' she added. 'This campaign is vitally important.'

Commenting on the campaign, Plan UK chief executive, Tanya Barron, said: 'These practices are a violation of girls’ rights and can cause severe physical and mental trauma.

'By putting the stories of real girls where they can’t be ignored, we hope to build momentum, unite opinion and end FGM and child marriage in a generation.

'We’re absolutely delighted that Lena, Natalie and Beverley are facing up to girls’ rights and are on board to help us get this vital message across.'

Plan UK is also launching a new online app so that supporters across the country can Face Up to violence against girls too, and join the Because I Am A Girl campaign.

Launched on September 30, the Face Up app will enable supporters to have the words ‘I’m putting girls’ rights where they can’t be ignored’ digitally placed on a photo of their own faces for them to share on social media platforms using #FaceUp.

The app will be available on the Plan UK website and Facebook.
