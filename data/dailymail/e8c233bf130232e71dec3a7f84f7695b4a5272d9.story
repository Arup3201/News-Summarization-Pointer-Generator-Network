Four high school football players have been caught on surveillance camera taking batteries and headphones from a closed New Jersey shop - and then leaving exact change for the goods on the counter, sales tax included.

The owners of Buddy's Small Lots in Wayne were shocked when they watched the security footage after getting a call reporting a break-in at the shop around 7 p.m. Sunday night.

They later learned there was never a break-in, a malfunctioning lock left the door to the closed shop open to anyone who wanted to walk in.

Honest: Four high school football players have been caught on surveillance camera, pictured, taking batteries and headphones from a closed New Jersey shop - and then leaving cash on then counter

In the video, which has now gone viral, the four teens are seen walking around the store looking for a sales clerk and waving at the cameras.

Then they found the goods they wanted and left cash on the counter for everything they took, including the appropriate sales tax.

'I think it's terrific that there are still people out there with moral character not to do the wrong thing when they easily could,' store owner Marci Lederman told NBC News.

Lederman was so impressed by the teens she set out to find them.

And on Tuesday, she did. It turned out the boys were football players at William Patterson High School, and stopped by the shop during a break in practice.

Thomas James, Kelle Gallimore, Jelani Bruce and Anthony Biondi are all playing their first year of Division III football for the school, and were running some errands before practice on Sunday.

They were in need of an audio cable for a set of dorm room speakers and some batteries, and didn't have any luck at Rite Aid, so they walked into Buddy's where the door was open and a few lights were still on.

The teens told the station that they didn't believe they did anything special and that they were surprised by the attention.

Happy: 'I think it's terrific that there are still people out there with moral character not to do the wrong thing when they easily could,' store owner Marci Lederman, pictured, said

'Soon as I went on my laptop it was 
right there, front page,' said Kelle Gallimore, who was seen on the 
cameras waving a dollar bill around before laying it on the store's 
counter.

'I was smiling because I was, like, world famous.'

But Lederman does think what they did was special. So much so she has given the teens $50 gift certificates to reward their honesty.

Jelani Bruce, another of the football players, said the store owner wasn't the only one impressed with his mature behavior.

He said his dad told him 'I'm proud of you for doing something good.'

Head football coach Jerry Flora added to NJ.com: 'They represented themselves, their families and the team very well.'
