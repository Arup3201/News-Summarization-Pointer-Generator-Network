American Nick Watney made nine birdies in a bogey-free round as he took an early lead at the Barracuda Championship in Reno.

Watney racked up 18 points with his stellar first round to take the initiative in the tournament, which uses the Modified Stableford format to allocate points based on the number of strokes taken at each hole.

Watney managed four birdies on the front nine, before things got even better for him as he picked up shots at the 10th, 13th, 14th, 15th and 18th holes.

Thinking it through: Nick Watney led after the opening day of the Barracuda Championship

'I'm very pleased with the way I played today,' Watney told www.pgatour.com.

'This is pretty close to home. So it's nice to see a lot of friends and family. I'm enjoying myself and hope it continues like this.'

His nearest challengers in Nevada are Australian Geoff Ogilvy and New Zealander Tim Wilkinson, who both finished two points behind on 16 after the opening day.

It could have been even better for Wilkinson though, who also managed to rack up nine birdies and would have been level with Watney were it not for bogeys on the second and sixth holes.

Within sight: Geoff Ogilvy trailed Watney by two points in second place after the opening day

Ogilvy, meanwhile, managed to pick up eight birdies to put himself in a strong position.

The 2006 US Open winner told www.pgatour.com: 'It was there for the taking. I birdied the holes I was supposed to.'

Scot Martin Laird managed seven birdies, with just one bogey blighting his round, to sit five points off the lead along with Chad Campbell.

Just behind them a four-strong American cluster, including Kevin Chappell sit on 12 points with three rounds left to play.
