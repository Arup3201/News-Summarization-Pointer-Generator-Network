Two Detroit men who became friends after being drafted for the war on the same day and who later served in the same infantry, were neighbors for almost two decades and didn't even know it.

Dave Brown and Roger Watson trained together at FT. Hood in Texas after being drafted in 1966, and were combat engineer demolition specialists in the 9th Infantry.

But the pair lost contact during the war. 

Roger Watson, left, and Dave Brown, who were drafted to the Vietnam war on the same day and trained together, were reunited recently when they learned they had been living next to each other for 18 years

After running into someone from Mr Watson's company, Mr Brown heard his friend had been injured.

Mr Watson had been shot seven months into his tour on March 8, 1968 and had lost a kidney and several feet of his small intestine, as well as damaging his liver.

Mr Brown later searched the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington for word of his training partner's fate, but never learned if he had survived the war.

But just before Halloween this year - some 40 years after the pair had last seen each other - they crossed paths again, at a fence adjoining their Berkley properties.

For 18 years the pair had lived nearly back to back without even knowing it.

The reunion came about through Mr Brown's wife Peggy Brown, middle, who sparked up a friendship with Mr Watson through their shared interest in birds

The men had 'wondered' about each other for 40 years after losing touch, and exchanged war stories and went through old service pictures when they came together recently in Berkley

Mr Brown, 68, told USA Today of finding out about Mr Watson: 'I was absolutely delighted.

'I wondered about you for 40 years.'

Mr Watson, 67, echoed his friends sentiment, saying he was 'almost shaken' as the pair exchanged war stories recently at Mr Watson's home.

Mr Watson recalled being shot. Mr Brown spoke of the first body he encountered. Both men had since become husbands, fathers and grandfathers.  

The reunion came about through Mr Brown's wife Peggy Brown, who had got to know Mr Watson through their shared interest in birds.

The pair trained together at FT. Hood in Texas after being drafted in 1966, and were combat engineer demolition specialists in the 9th Infantry; Mr Watson was injured seven months into his tour but Mr Brown never learned if his old friend had survived or not; a bomb explodes above in a small village near Ba Da, which was thought to be a Viet Cong stronghold during the war

Mrs Brown had noticed her new friend's Purple Heart licence plate and his 9th Infantry Vietnam Veterans cap in the window of his car - observations she later shared with her husband. 

Then, during an email exchange about a picture of a hawk, Mrs Brown mentioned her husband had also served in Vietnam and Mr Watson realized she was talking about his old friend. 

After looking at photos of the pair as soldier, the newspaper reports that Mrs Brown wrote: 'This has to be coincidence of the century. Dave cannot believe all this and we've been here for 18 years in Berkley. What are the odds?'

Mr Watson said he had only caught glimpses of his neighbor over the years. And both men said their gardens often blocked out each other's backyards. 

Mr Watson said: 'It's sort of amazing we've been neighbors this long.'

Brown concluded: 'It's just great to see him alive. 

'It makes me happy.'
