The
 Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures' sci-fi monster reboot, starring 
Bryan Cranston and Aaron Taylor-Johnson trumped last weekend's No. 1 
hit, Universal Pictures 'Neighbors,' which was pushed down to No. 2 in 
its second weekend.

The raunchy comedy earned $26 million, bringing its domestic total to a solid $91.5million.

Sources told the Hollywood Reporter that a Godzilla sequel is 'in the works.'

'We have a franchise in the making, and we're looking at sequels as we speak,' Dan Fellman, Warner Bros. president of domestic distribution, told Reuters.

58 percent of Godzilla viewers this weekend were male and 40 percent were under 40 years old, the Reporter said.

Rounding
 out the top three is 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' with $16.8million. So 
far it's earned a total of $172million domestically.

Also opening this weekend, Disney's feel-good sports drama 'Million Dollar Arm,' starring Jon Hamm, gained $11 million.
