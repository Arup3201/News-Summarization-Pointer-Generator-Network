A disgraced bank director who the FBI believes faked his own suicide in order to escape the mounting charges against him left a lengthy, detailed confession note before he vanished.

Investigators are looking at whether the letter written by Aubrey Lee Price, 46, is a genuine suicide note - or if he faked his death to go on the lam with more than $17 million swindled from investors.

The Valdosta, Georgia resident disappeared shortly after announcing to family members that he planned to jump off a ferry out of Key West, Florida - where he was last seen in June.

'My depression and discouragement have driven me to deep anxiety, fear and shame,' the confession note reads. 'I am emotionally overwhelmed and incapable of continuing in this life.'

Wanted: Former bank director Aubrey Lee Price has not been since June, after he told family members he was going to commit suicide. The FBI is investigating whether he faked his death

The married father went on: 'I created false statements, covered up my losses and deceived and hurt the very people I was trying to help.'

The note, which is littered with grammatical errors and Bible verses, begins with an apology for its 'lack of structure, grammar and harmony of thought'.

Price claims he was entirely responsible for the banking losses but that he was given bad advice and that banking was outside his area of expertise.

He apologises to his clients, associates and partners but denies any money was stolen, saying it was all lost through bad investments.

fund that he managed

Price left his home on June 16 after telling family he was headed to Guatemala for business, said Sgt. Aaron Pritchett of the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office.

Two days later, his family received 
letters saying he was going to Key West and planned to jump off a ferry 
headed to Fort Meyers.

Credit card records show he bought dive weights and a ferry ticket, which was scanned at the boarding point. He has not been seen since.

Investigators are not ruling out the possibility he has fled to Venezuela, where he frequently travelled and said he owned property. They believe he could have a boat to travel from Florida to the country.

The disappearance comes after Price became director of Montgomery Bank & Trust in December 2010 - and subsequent claims he swindled millions from investors in Georgia and Florida.

Lies? Investigators remain unconvinced that the shamed money manager isn't somewhere on the lam with $17million in stolen funds from the Montgomery Bank and Trust, pictured

Rather than investing the money as he said he would, Price allegedly wired funds into accounts he controlled at other financial institutions and provided bank managers with fake documents.

The FBI and federal prosecutors said Price embezzled $17 million in bank funds. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has now seized Montgomery Bank & Trust.

Officials believe that Price raised 
$40million from more than 100 investors since 2009.

He forged bank documents to hide 
the millions of loses his investors suffered, so that they would 
continue giving him money.

He routinely sent investors messages saying the firm, for which he made 
the investment decisions, was consistently making positive returns, according to the SEC 
lawsuit.

Victim: Wendy Cross, pictured waiting for customers at her food truck in Atlanta, invested $300,000 in Price's bank. Cross said she will have to sell her truck because of her losses

Life's work: She said she is devastated and that the softly-spoken Price must have been an amazing actor

'I
don't believe he's dead. I believe he planned for this exit,' Wendy Cross, an Atlantan who says she lost her $364,000 nest egg by 
investing with Price, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

The 46-year-old said she had met Price and described him as a very religious, soft-spoken man.

'He should have won an Oscar for his performance that day,' she said. 'He has left a path of financial carnage.'

She discovered something was wrong last month when she wanted to withdraw some money from the firm to invest in another business.

She tried multiple times to contact the firm to withdraw money. When she texted her financial adviser, he responded that he had had no idea what was going on at the company.

Search: The FBI believes Price could be in Venezuela, where he has property and regularly visits

Cross said she has to sell her business as she needs the money to live and cannot afford a lawyer.

Price had moved his family from Bradenton, Florida to the Valdosta, Georgia, where his wife's parents live, just a few weeks before he disappeared.

There were financial reasons behind the move, but it also appears Price may have been trying to make things easier on his family once he disappeared, Pritchett said.

Pritchett said he would not speculate on whether the man was alive: 'Until we have a body, it's kind of hard to say. It's almost like a novel.'
