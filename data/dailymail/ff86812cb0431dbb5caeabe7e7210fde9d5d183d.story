This is the moment a defenceless rabbit was snapped up and swallowed whole by a seagull.

The incredible footage was captured by a rambler on the island of Skellig Michael off the coast of County Kerry, Ireland.

The bird can be seen vigorously shaking the rabbit before it attempts to swallow its lifeless body in one go.

Michael Kelly, who captured the pictures in May 2010, had gone out to photograph puffins when he stumbled across the vicious encounter.

He recalled seeing the gull swoop down beside him and ‘pull’ on the rabbits head.

The rabbit can be seen attempting to put up a fight but there was to be no contest between the two.

Mr Kelly told the Daily Mirror: ‘I couldn’t believe it! You’ll often see pictures of herons grabbing fish and you think ‘How the hell was that photographer there? How did he manage to get it?’

‘This happened right beside me, it was amazing.’

He added: ‘They do the same with puffin chicks and razorbill chicks and I’ve often seen it happen but not with a rabbit.’

However, on the Skellig islands the carnivorous seagulls are not a rarity and have been spotted eating rabbits before.
