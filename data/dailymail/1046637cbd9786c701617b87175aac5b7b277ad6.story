The FIFA presidential election - becoming a bigger circus by the day – has another candidate with former world footballer of the year Luis Figo surprisingly deciding to stand on the eve of the deadline.

However Figo entering the crowded race has more to do with the tactical machinations going on between FIFA's Zurich and UEFA's Nyon than the Portuguese football great having any noted sporting political ambitions – even with compatriot Jose Mourinho's endorsement.

The UEFA game plan is to crowd the election hustings with as many 'credible' candidates as possible so that the anti Sepp Blatter agenda is heard loudly in as many places as possible before the ballot on May 29.

Luis Figo surprisingly announced his intention to stand against Sepp Blatter to become FIFA president 

UEFA want to flood the presidential vote with anti Sepp Blatter candidates so word of the unhappiness spreads

This is seen as the best way of destabilising Blatter, who is seeking a ludicrous fifth term and already has enough promised votes from the 209 territories to practically guarantee him victory.

Such is the way that UEFA are spreading their bets that they have welcomed the bizarre decision by the FA to support Prince Ali of Jordan when Europe are now fielding Holland's Michael Van Praag and Figo.

And it will not go un-noticed by Paddy Power stunt funded David Ginola that Figo has just cut his links with Asian betting company Dafabet .

Scotland have pledged their backing to van Praag having supported Blatter in 2011 on proviso that it would be his last term – which it isn't .

Jerome Champagne, the most fanciful of candidates for the FIFA presidency, is having to rely on former colleague Sepp Blatter - if he sees fit - gifting him the necessary five nominations needed to stand.

Champagne has failed to garner enough support despite spending a year on the campaign trail and sending out regular dreary policy statements. 

Jerome Champagne needs Blatter to gift him five nominations to stand against him as a candidate

So who - if anyone - will want to read an entire book about his way forward for FIFA being published in France this week.

The Premier League fast tracking their TV rights auction over the next fortnight to ensure broadcast regulator Ofcom did not derail the expected £5 billion bonanza was reported by Sports Agenda last Saturday.

Now Virgin Media, whose initial complaint about the cost of TV matches instigated the Ofcom probe, have asked Ofcom to force the Premier League to postpone the auction until the investigation is completed.

Ofcom said last: 'We aim to reach a decision in a matter of days'. 

But Ofcom themselves could have decided a lot earlier in the process to order the delay and the timing of Virgin Media's request was described as 'self- serving' by the PL. And the PL , who would bring in lawyers ASAP if challenged, say there is 'no legal basis whatsoever for any interference.'.

Swimming is one of the sports who have satisfied Sport England that improved systems and governance justify a return to multi-year support rather than one-year only grants. 

Sport England's delayed Active People Survey on whose findings they rely to a massive extent for their grass-roots funding decision-making, will finally be announced today. 

The figures will be particularly sensitive around the two national sports ,football and cricket where 11-a-side participation has been in worrying decline. But overall football and cricket 's APS numbers will be up today..

Greg Dyke faces an explosive board meeting at the Football Association on Thursday

The FA board meeting today is likely to be an explosive affair after the Premier League – represented at Wembley by David Gill and Nic Coward – rejected Greg Dyke's England commission-led initiative to scrap work permit appeals. 

Home Office regulations require a consensus within English football for such a change. As limiting overseas players was a central plank of Dyke's strategy for improving the national team, this issue is sure to cause ructions.

Panned referee Michael Oliver , who didn't spot two blatant Diego Costa stamping offences during the Capital One Cup semi-final as well as missing a clear penalty, may need the services of PR consultancy Oporto Sports hired by Northumberland FA.

Michael Oliver has been criticised for his refereeing display in Chelsea's win over Liverpool

The big-spending county FA's chief executive is Clive Oliver, father of Michael who heads the referees academy. 

And Michael's partner and female ref Lucy May was subject to sexist remarks from county vice-president John Cummings that led to his four-month ban from the game.
