When you’re holding a christening, there are plenty of things to remember – but surely an important one is ensuring the star of the day is buckled up on the way to church.

However, Lord Freddie Windsor’s four-month-old daughter Maud was carried on the lap of her mother Sophie Winkleman instead of in a car seat, an offence that can carry a £500 fine.

Lord Freddie’s father Prince Michael of Kent was also spotted driving to the christening with his wife Princess Michael and their daughter Lady Gabriella in the back seat – neither of whom were wearing seatbelts.

Embarrassingly, Prince Michael is patron of the Commission for Global Road Safety and last week handed out prizes for his acclaimed International Road Safety awards scheme at the Savoy hotel in London.

The royals were spotted on the way to the christening at the Chapel Royal at St James’s Palace of Maud Elizabeth Daphne Marina Windsor, who is 42nd in line to the throne.

Lady Frederick – who gave birth at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Centre in  Los Angeles on August 15 – is based in America as she pursues her acting career.

The 33-year-old most recently appeared in last year’s Titanic, a mini-series by Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes.

Last night Edmund King, President of the AA, said: ‘You could be kind by suggesting as this couple live in America they may have come to Britain and not been able to find a child seat for their car. That has happened to me when I have hired a car abroad and it is a frightening experience.

New regulations governing the use of child car seat came into force in September 2006

It
 was announced then that the standard fixed penalty for not using a 
child restraint is £30 but if the case goes to court the maximum fine is
 £500.

Seat belts must be 
worn by adult passengers who are classed as 14 and over.

The law states 
that children must be seated in a child or booster seat to protect them 
adequately from road accidents, up until they are 12 years old or 135cm 
tall.

It has been 
revealed, however, that over a quarter (26 per cent) of parents do not 
know this law, and 26 per cent have used a seat that does not fit 
properly.

Almost half (47 
per cent) have foregone the use of a seat when in a vehicle other than 
their own, such as a taxi or friend’s car, and 27 per cent have used a 
seat that would not be recommended by safety experts, such as a second 
hand model.

One in 20 parents admitted they have never used a child or booster seat.

‘However, the laws are clear and are in the Highway code - and the AA view is that a child in a car is far safer being held in a proper car seat or child restraint.

‘That goes for all members of the public and irrespective of whether you are Royalty.’

Freddie Windsor’s wife Sophie Winkleman - who gave birth to her daughter at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Centre in Los Angeles on August 15 - bases herself in the United States to pursue her acting career.

Car child seats and seat belts must also be used in America by law - but the ages of when children must be restrained does vary in different states.

In the UK the maximum fine which can be imposed by a court for not wearing a seat belt or similar restraint in a car is £500.

The RoSPA (Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents) charity has a website relating to the use of child care seats which states: ‘Failure to wear a seat belt or failure to ensure that a child passenger uses an appropriate child restraint or wears a seat belt according to the legal requirements described above, could affect any claims against your motor insurance cover.

‘You could also face civil proceedings for damages, if you failed to safely carry someone else’s child.

But of course the most serious penalty of all could be that you or a passenger loses their life!’ Others seen not wearing belts at the christening included Sophie’s mother-in-law Princess Michael of Kent and her daughter Lady Gabriella.

Car safety charity Brake has recently warned parents that 700 children under eight years old are killed or seriously injured in road accidents each year, but that the use of a child or booster seat can greatly reduce the risk of a fatality.

Support: Sophie said her husband Lord Freddie Windsor was 'very brave' during the labour as she 'just wanted to throw a saucepan at his head'

Julie Townsend, deputy chief executive of Brake, said earlier this year: ‘It’s vital that parents, carers and of course the wider driving public understand how best to protect children on roads, and its worrying to find common misunderstanding about child car seats.

We recommend parents always use a correctly-fitted suitable child or booster seat until a child is 150cm tall.’ On Monday Maud Windsor wore the same Honiton lace christening gown as Prince George of Cambridge who was christened at the same venue in October.

On that occasion the young Prince was seen in his car seat both arriving and leaving St James’s Palace - and he was famously carried by Prince William in a car seat when he left hospital shortly after being born .

Many hospitals have a policy which will not allow them to discharge a new-born baby unless parents can show they have a car seat installed in their vehicle.

The Department for Transport refused to comment on the matter.

The awards are said to ‘recognise achievements and innovations which will improve road safety.’ According to his awards website ‘ all road users are asked to identify those whose initiatives make our roads safer and nominate them for an award.’

Embarrassingly for the Prince the last awards ceremony and Gala Presentation was held less than a fortnight ago.

A spokesman for Prince Michael of Kent yesterday told the Daily Mail: ‘No Comment.’
