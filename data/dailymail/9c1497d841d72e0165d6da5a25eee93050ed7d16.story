Former England footballer Paul Gascoigne looked the picture of health as he was spotted popping to an off licence with friends.

The 47-year-old, who was briefly sectioned for his own safety in October, appeared happy and relaxed as he visited the corner shop in east London.

The former midfielder, who put his recent stint in hospital following an apparent alcohol binge down to 'just to a little blip', could be seen chatting and laughing with friends while smoking a cigarette before popping into the shop.

Gascoigne, who retired from football in 2004, was dressed in an oversized coat, jeans and trainers and left the convenience store without alcohol on Thursday night.

The former football star has rarely been seen in public since his hospitalisation during which he was placed on a three-day emergency detox, but is now said to have taken up a healthy diet and exercise regime.

Last month, he admitted that ‘the only person who can save me is me’, and vowed to stay on the straight and narrow after listening to doctors' warnings that alcohol will kill him.

The former England, Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle footballer, who made 57 appearances for England, was first sectioned under the Mental Health Act in 2008 following an incident at a Newcastle hotel.

His latest sectioning in the early hours of October 24 came following an apparent alcohol binge.

During his time in hospital, he is said to have taken the opportunity to improve his health and fitness by doing up to 800 press-ups, sit-ups and squats every day.

Gascoigne, who now prays every morning, claimed he had only drunk for one year out of the last 18 and admitted he was lucky to have nipped his relapses in the bud quickly.

Since returning to his home in the wealthy Sandbanks area of Poole, Dorset, he is said to have continued with his exercise regime and his efforts appeared to be paying off when he was spotted during his outing to the off licence.

He smiled towards onlookers as he puffed on a cigarette outside, with a mobile phone in one hand and a piece of paper under his arm, before entering the shop and leaving again empty-handed.

As well as making daily trips to the gym and concentrating on his diet, the former footballer also continues to be supported by his close friend and rumoured girlfriend Mandy Thomas.

The 44-year-old has stood by his side throughout the last few turbulent months.

They are said to have met and become friendly after Gascoigne visited the post office she runs in Bournemouth, Dorset, several years ago. 

Last month, Gascoigne spoke about his ongoing battle with booze in a TV interview.

He admitted to This Morning presenters Ruth Langsford and Eamonn Holmes that he 'knew he was in trouble straight away' after his most recent relapse.

He said that he wasn't in a 'massive state', but admitted that it was enough 'to get himself into trouble'.

It emerged last week that an Oscar-nominated production team is said to be keen on the idea of basing a film around the former footballer's life. Early indications suggest that it could be called: 'Gazza - British Raging Bull'

It emerged last week that an Oscar-nominated production team is said to be keen on the idea of basing a film around the former footballer's life. 

Early indications suggest that producers are considering calling the movie 'Gazza - British Raging Bull', and it will follow his playing days and his battle with drink.

Gascoigne is said to be aware of the film plans and has even suggested that actor Sean Bean plays him. EastEnders star Danny Dyer, 37, and Skins actor Jack O'Connell, 24, are also said to be rumoured contenders for the part. 

A source close to Gascoigne told the Daily Star that the film was already at 'planning stage'.

He said: 'An initial contract has been signed. We're working with a well-respected production company who have been nominated for an Oscar in the past.

'Paul has had an incredible life and we know they'll do it justice on screen. He's very excited.'
