Residents living near the epicenter of the Ebola scare in North Texas say they are suffering unfair discrimination due to the stigma of the disease.

People living in the Vickery Meadow neighborhood of Dallas believe they have been shunned by the wider community since Thomas Eric Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola.

Mr Duncan - the first person to be diagnosed with the virus within the US - stayed at an apartment in the community before being admitted to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital where he remains in critical condition.

Dallas City Council member Jennifer Staubach Gates told CBS DFW that most of the residents are concerned about the possible stigma of living near the Ivy Apartment complex.

'Unfortunately, they are feeling discriminated against,' she said. 'We still have some that have been turned away from jobs. Some that have been turned away at retail locations. We're getting them in touch with legal aid and any resources necessary.'

A cleaning crew has also finished 'Phase 2' of the apartment cleaning process by destroying the majority of Mr Duncan's personal items.

The decontamination was carried out by hazardous materials specialists and additional cleaning items were carried away in a drum with a police escort on Monday.

'As of noon today, that apartment is completely cleaned up,' said Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings. 

But Ms Gates believes that educating the public is the only way to reverse the stigma. 

'These residents, unless they happen to be one of those that were exposed that are being traced, they are not at risk for getting the disease and are not at risk for transmitting the diseases,' she said.

There are forty eight individuals identified as 'high risk' patients, having come in contact with Mr Duncan. Mayor Rawlings explained that these individuals are being seen once a day and are having their temperatures checked twice daily.

The Ivy Apartment complex is guarded by Vickery Meadow patrol. A backlash is causing a shortage of volunteers at some charities and community leaders have noticed work-related problems surfacing at others.

'We have zero symptoms out there,' he said. 'Zero. That is a good sign.'

Mr Duncan, who contracted the disease in his native Liberia, is now receiving doses of experimental anti-viral drug brincidofovir, which has shown promise in fighting the disease. 

According to Dallas News, the stigma in the community is causing a shortage of volunteers at some charities and community leaders have noticed work-related problems surfacing at others.

Ellen Mata, director of mission programs at NorthPark Presbyterian Church told the paper that up to two dozen volunteers failed to show up in the week since the Ebola crisis began.

'Several of these nonprofits have had volunteers who have backed out on commitments,' she said. 'We are trying to fill those.'

'Some of the after-school programs are needing volunteers to help with tutoring and reading with the kiddos,' she added. 'They are looking for some people to help with special projects.

Officials are also concerned that people in need are choosing to stay at home rather than reach out to organizations that can help them.

'People needing food were afraid to leave their family ... because of the way people [in the community] are treating them,' Ms Mata said.

Ms Gates Told CBS DFW that the faith community is working to  disseminate information among the community to help educate the public.

But with over 40 languages and dialects spoken in the community, organizations are facing an uphill struggle  to translate the information and ensure they effectively communicate with everyone.

'It's about you, the public, spreading the word about how this disease is spread. This community is healthy,' Ms Gates said. 

'This is a vulnerable community that could use all the help that they can get.'
