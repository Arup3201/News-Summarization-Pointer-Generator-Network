A transgender girl who allegedly assaulted two people on Saturday night at a psychiatric center was transferred to a juvenile home for boys.

The 16-year-old girl, known only as Jane Doe, assaulted another youth and a staff member at Children's Psychiatric Center in Middletown, Connecticut, the Department of Children and Families said Sunday.

The girl also destroyed property, the agency said.

Officials said there is no 'suitable place' at the psychiatric facility 'that can ensure the safety of youths and staff.'Â 

She is now in a single room at the Juvenile Training School - the only secure facility for delinquent boys - which is also located in Middletown.

Gary Kleeblatt, a spokesman for the agency, said the unit at the psychiatric center where the girl had been held is the only secure, all-female facility run by the agency. He said he could not release details of the alleged assault.

The DCF statement said state police had been notified.

'We are confident they will take whatever action they deem is appropriate,' the agency said.

Her lawyer, Aaron Romano, criticized the agency and Commissioner Joette Katz for issuing a news release rather than notifying him or other lawyers representing the girl.

'I am shocked and disappointed at the commissioner,' he said. 'I question whether the commissioner should continue to be in her position if she believes in this litigation in the press.'

Transfer: The girl was moved to Juvenile Training School, a facility for boys

Romano accused DCF of breaking promises to get therapy for his client and seek foster care.

'Nothing has materialized,' he said.

Romano earlier said the girl had been physically and sexually abused throughout her life.

The girl had been detained in the Connecticut adult women's prison without criminal charges and was moved last month to the psychiatric center.

The Hartford Courant reports the girl earlier assaulted two workers at other facilities - one in Connecticut and one in Massachusetts - and that assault charges were filed in the former.

She had been in DCF custody before being sent to jail. DCF officials said she was too violent for them to handle and asked a state judge to transfer her into Department of Correction custody as authorized by a seldom-used state law.

The judge approved the request in April.
