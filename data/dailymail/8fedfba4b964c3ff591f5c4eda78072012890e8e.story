England have now lost five matches on the bounce and Stuart Lancaster's men are coming under pressure to get a result against Samoa.

Consecutive defeats to New Zealand and South Africa have left the Red Rose wounded after two November internationals. 

Here, Sportsmail's Sam Peters analyses where England have failed to match their southern-hemisphere rivals in the autumn internationals.

CARRY ON CARRYING

Only South Africa have made fewer carries than England, who desperately need to add ballast to a back row short of carriers. James Haskell is the clear favourite to return to add a threat with the ball.

Carries per game: 

Australia 150, New Zealand 130, England 102, South Africa 100.

NO DRIVING AMBITION

England have made fewer metres than any of the southern-hemisphere powers. They are not explosive enough through contact, while the passing in the threequarters is not putting players into space.

Metres per game:

New Zealand 552.3, Australia 475.3, South Africa 296.0, England 292.5.

England have made fewer metres this autumn then any of the southern-hemisphere sides

TAKE A BREAK

South Africa - who lost to Ireland, don’t forget - have made fewer breaks but they base their game on relentless surging power. England are establishing set-piece dominance but lack the nous and creativity to make space for their dangerous runners.

Clean breaks per game:

New Zealand 11.3, Australia 6.3, England 5.0, South Africa 3.5.

England are lacking nous and creativity and need to turn to someone like George Ford

PASSING THE BUCK

You can’t generate a stat for the quality of passing but it’s clear England’s has been poor. A strong rugby league influence seems to favour end-over-end style which has a less predictable trajectory than old-fashioned spin pass. Danny Cipriani is the most sympathetic distributor in the country and England are missing his passing game.

WHO TURNED OFF THE POWER?

Without powerful centres Manu Tuilagi and Luther Burrell, England simply fail to go route one in the midfield. England are not powerful enough to blast through tackles so need to use quick feet and better spatial awareness to put players through gaps. At the moment they’re doing neither.

Defenders beaten per game: 

New Zealand 25.8, Australia 20.5, England 19.0 South Africa 13.5.

England are missing the power of someone like Manu Tuilagi in the middle of the park right now

A LOAD OF TROUBLE

Just four offloads in two matches is a paltry return. The start of Lancaster’s tenure saw England commit defenders but move the point of attack from breakdown with two quick passes. A lack of offloads indicates a lack of confidence in support runners and lack of footballing ability. New Zealand are light years ahead in this department.

Offloads per game: 

New Zealand 17.5, Australia 9.3, South Africa 5.5, England 4.0.

South Africa came out on top 31-28 at Twickenham on Saturday to inflict another defeat on England 

IT’S TURNING BAD

England are way behind New Zealand and South Africa at scavenging on the floor. The country that produced Neil Back and Peter Winterbottom seems to have forgotten the role of a proper No 7. Robshaw is an outstanding back-row player but is more suited to No 6. It’s telling his opposite man has won man-of-the-match awards in both games as England have lost the breakdown battle.

Turnovers won per game:

South Africa 9.0, New Zealand 7.8, England 5.5, Australia 4.0.

Chris Robshaw is a great player but should be at No 6 because England are lacking a scavenger
