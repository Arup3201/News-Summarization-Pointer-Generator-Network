The parents of missing Lisa Irwin have refused to be interviewed separately by police, it was claimed by officers today.

But an attorney representing Deborah Bradley, 25, and Jeremy Irwin, 29, denied they were opposed to separate interviews saying that they had only refused police requests for an unrestricted interview with no attorneys present.

'Being questioned separately is not the 
issue,' attorney Cyndy Short told CNN.

Co-operating? Police have claimed that Deborah Bradley and Jeremy Irwin have refused separate interviews about their daughter's disappearance

She added that the couple did not mind being interviewed separately if the officers were fair, open-minded and not accusatory.

Baby Lisa's parents and their 
attorneys have repeatedly clashed with police over claims that they have
not been co-operating fully.

Police yesterday said that they needed 
the parents to submit to separate interviews and to answer a list of 
'tough questions' that detectives 'need answered'.

The family's attorney Joe Tacopina 
responded saying that 'they've done everything they've been asked to do… 
They have nothing to hide, they want answers.'

But when asked by ABC News if there 
were any restrictions on what they would speak to police about he said: 
'Oh, there's a restriction. I'm imposing that the questioning is going 
to be in good faith and fair and not the questioning that was done 
within an hour of baby Lisa's disappearance.'

Brothers: The boys, six and eight, reportedly heard noises on the night that Lisa Irwin disappeared

Parents: Deborah Bradley and Jeremy Irwin had been refusing to let officers speak to their sons

The news came as the parents said they are to allow their sons to be questioned by police and will undergo DNA testing.

The older brothers of the missing 
11-month-old, who are aged six and eight, were in the house in Kansas 
City, Missouri, the night she disappeared and reportedly heard noises.

But the parents had refused to let officers speak to them since initial enquiries the night their sister vanished.

Now lawyers for the couple have told ABC News that the boys will be questioned and undergo DNA tests on Friday.

According to police, the questioning will be conducted by a child services specialist.

DNA samples are being taken in order to eliminate unknown DNA evidence from items collected from inside the family home.

The refusal by the parents to allow 
officers to speak to the boys had been a source of contention as police 
claim they are relevant witnesses.

Bradley had reportedly said that she 
had not talked to Lisa's brothers herself about what they heard because 
she did not want to put them through anything else.

The boys, who are half-brothers to Lisa, were apparently sleeping in bed with Bradley when their sister disappeared.

The eldest brother, eight, is the son
of Irwin and his former partner. The younger brother, six, is the son 
of Bradley and her husband, from whom she is separated but not divorced.

Lisa Irwin vanished on the night of 
October 3 in Kansas City, Missouri, after her mother Deborah Bradley 
claims she checked on her in bed at 10:30pm.

Later that night, when Lisa's father 
Jeremy Irwin checked on the child when he got home from work, the baby 
was gone, and she was reported missing.

Irwin and Bradley claimed someone 
must have crept into their home while the child's mother and brothers 
slept and snatched the baby girl, saying that the front window had been 
tampered with.

Police have searched the couple's home, nearby wooded areas, an industrial park, landfills and sewers.
