As the world's most celebrated personal shopper for nearly four decades, Betty Halbreich has seen it all.

And now, the glamorous 86-year-old has offered a glimpse into the most memorable moments of her illustrious career - from teaching a young Candice Bergen how to walk in heels to instructing former President Gerald Ford on how to carry a garment bag.

These are just some of the memories the famed Bergdorf Goodman personal shopper recalls in her new memoir, I'll Drink to That: A Life in Style, With a Twist, which hits stores on Thursday.

One of the most striking aspects of Betty is that she views her job not as a mere salesperson, but more as a therapist.

'"Patients," I call them. They open up to me like a therapist,' she told WWD. 'It's very difficult to describe what I do. Yesterday I said, "Basically, I'm a clerk" - a very costly clerk for 37 years.'

Even though she launched her career a staggering 37 years ago, Betty has experienced a resurgence in the limelight recently - first when she was featured in a documentary called Scatter My Ashes At Bergdorf's, which was released last year.

And now, not only is her highly-anticipated book about to hit shelves, but she is also working with Lena Dunham to create a comedy series based on her life.

'She is one of the most gracious, full of fun, intelligent, sane, intellectual people I've ever met,' Betty writes about the Girls star, 28, who has become an unlikely ally.

Betty has made her fair share of famous friends in her time. Indeed, in her memoir she describes how President Gerald Ford came to her to pick up an altered dress for his wife, and she took it upon herself to show him how to carry it correctly.

'It had just been pressed and finished. He took it and wrapped it over his arm like he was taking his shirts to laundry,' she recalls.

'I said, "Oh, for God's sake. She’s going to wear that dress tonight," she explains.

'He said, "I can't believe Betty's telling me how to carry a dress." I said, "At least I’m not telling you how to run the country."'

The quick-witted octogenarian goes on to say that the pair had 'a wonderful love affair. She came out of that dressing room and showed him every dress. And his appreciation for her was written all over his face.'

Much of Betty's success is due to her ability to adapt to the times - although she can't help but remark on how much the fashion world has changed since her youth.

'We dressed - that's what's different,' she writes. 'You went to El Morocco on Saturday night and tipped the head waiter heavily to get a table. You didn't think about going out not dressed.'

Flashback: 'We dressed - that's what's different,' she says of fashion back in her day. 'You went to El Morocco on Saturday night and tipped the head waiter heavily to get a table. You didn't think about going out not dressed'

In contrast to the overwhelmingly casual style of today's population, 'When you went into a store - let's say Bonwit Teller or Lord & Taylor - you got dressed up,' she says. 'You wouldn't walk around in shorts or tight white pants.'

Indeed, this last trend is one that Betty just cannot get her head around.

'Have you noticed everyone is walking around in tight white pants - large, medium, small?' she says.

'They are so awful. I just can't wait until people put their coats back on in winter and hide all this provocativeness.'

Thanks to her influential fashion sense and no-nonsense outlook, Betty has amassed an endless list of famous friends. 

'Lauren Bacall, Betty Buckley, Susan Lucci, Jane Pauley,' she rattles off effortlessly.

'Gwyneth Paltrow, Jane Curtain, Sharon Stone - I don’t even remember her - Julia Roberts, Bobbi Brown, Estée Lauder - that was something - Babe Paley, Farrah Fawcett. These are the people who were great to work with. The ones that I didn’t keep a list of weren't so great to work with.'

But at the heart of it all, she says her job is about more than just doling out style advice.

'For me, dressing someone well is as divine as helping someone to walk, to see, to smile or to bake a tall, light angel food cake,' she writes in her typically poetic fashion.

'You're probably looking at one of the most satisfied people in the world,' she adds. 'I'm really blessed, I can sit here at 86 and talk to you. I still have my teeth and the rest of me is OK.'
