Suki Waterhouse skipped fashion week in favour of spending time in Hollywood but her younger doppelganger is keeping her spot on the catwalk warm in her absence.

Immy Waterhouse, Suki's 20-year-old sister, made her catwalk debut in the Ashley Williams AW15 show and now she's landed a top fashion campaign, too. 

Immy  stars in the new Helmer campaign launching the Shevy clutch - and is the ultimate Seventies siren in the shoot.

Rocking perfect curls, flawless skin and super wide fit flares, Immy proves her worth as a fledgling model in her first-ever accessories campaign. 

The brand, which is loved by Amber Le Bon, Natalie Dormer and Halle Berry, is thrilled to have the burgeoning clothes horse on board and it's just the latest in a string of coups for the model. 

Suki's younger doppelganger is proving to be a serious contender in the fashion industry

She also starred in a modelling campaign for Asda's George's G21 Talent label, a collection of clothing designed by young designers handpicked from Graduate Fashion Week, last June.

She has also lent her good looks to campaigns for Urban Outfitters, Coast and Asda.

Immy recently spoke about her sister saying that, like Suki, she's not typical height-wise for a model and explained how her sister told her to forget about those stereotypes

Clearly keen to follow in her older sister's fashionable footsteps, Immy says that Suki's success has inspired her own career.

'Suki has shown me that hard work pays off and rejection is a big part of it,' she told Vogue.

'Like Suki, I'm not typical height-wise for a model (Immy is 6ft 5) - so she advised me to just forget about those stereotypes.'

Immy's agency hail her 'a fantastic young actress and model' and she's already proving them right
