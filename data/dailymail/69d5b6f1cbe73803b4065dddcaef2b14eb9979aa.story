Cycling's international governing body (UCI) has announced tougher anti-doping measures including night-time visits by testers and an integrity test for team leaders and doctors.

The announcement comes in response to the Cycling Independent Reform Commission (CIRC) report into the Lance Armstrong scandal and other doping cases.

The UCI has also established a task force to ensure the CIRC recommendations are followed through.
