Some people live to lift the burden of others. 

Dr Catherine Hamlin, who has been nominated this year for the Nobel Peace Prize, is a living testament to this idea.

For over half a century, Dr Hamlin has made it her mission to cure the unfortunate women who suffer from obstetric fistula, a horrific condition resulting from obstructed labour.

While obstetric fistula was eradicated in the western world in the 1920s, many developing countries still have hundreds of thousands of women who suffer from the injury.

In the 1950s, Hamlin travelled to Ethiopia from her stomping grounds of northern Sydney.

 It was there she established the Addis Ababa Fistula Hospital and the Hamlin College of Midwives, then expanded the operations to five other hospitals.

Since then, Dr Hamlin has treated over 40,000 women with obstetric injury. She has perfected the modern technique for obstetric fistula surgery and has a more than a 90 per cent success rate.

Despite having reached the ripe old age of 90, Hamlin still works almost every day towards her goal of eradicating fistula injury.

A significant part of Hamlin's operation is international charity work, which fuels the organisations she founded in Ethiopia.

 In 2012, Dr Hamlin appointed Lucy Perry as the Chief Executive Officer of Hamlin Fistula Ethiopia in Australia.

Perry told Daily Mail Australia that Dr Hamlin was humbled by her nomination for the Nobel Peace Prize. 

'Catherine was delighted. She was nominated by her friend Dr Tedros, the Foreign Minister of Ethiopia.'

'She's a very humble person, and never looks for accolades, but she's thrilled because the nomination has shined light on obstetric fistula injuries.'

'Her only qualm was that she wishes  all of the staff who have helped her make the mission possible could be nominated with her.'

Perry's Australian branch of Dr Hamlin's charity raises money for the various operations. Despite there being multiple other countries who contribute, Perry says Australia is the driving force of donations.

'Australia provides 90 per cent of the funds to the company. This year, we're set on track to double our income to 6 million.'

Ms Perry explained that Dr Hamlin remains highly dedicated to her mission, despite her impressive age.

'Catherine was still performing surgery until very recently, which is incredible. She still works six days of the week, waking at six and going to bed at 11.'

'Catherine works on the wards, and also writes thousands of letters: she remains incredibly active.'  

Obstetric fistula injury can result in agonising labour that lasts for days.

Babies rarely survive the birth and the mothers are left with horrific internal injuries, including chronic incontinence and irreversible damage.

But perhaps the most difficult feature is the societal stigma. 50 per cent of woman suffering from the disease are divorced, and victims are often shunned by their own families. 

Many are even considered a curse.

To combat this, Hamlin trains midwives to work in the villages of Ethiopia, teaching locals how to avoid the injury and finding victims to admit into her hospitals.

Dr Hamlin said her only qualm was that she wish she could have the award granted to all of the staff who have helped her make the mission possible

When asked if she thought Dr Hamlin would take the award, Perry said 'Catherine's nomination was released early because it was posted on social media.

 'There is on way of knowing if she will win, since the rest of the nominees have yet to be announced, but there's no question she deserves the award for longevity.'

'Winning would help to secure Catherine's legacy: to fund her organisation until the occurrence of fistula injury is eradicated. It would also be fantastic to put the condition on a global stage.'
