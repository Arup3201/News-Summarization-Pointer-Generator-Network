Forgiving: Mother-of-two Mrs Hedges said she has no ill feeling towards the two boys responsible for her injuries

One of the teenage boys who pushed a 
shopping cart onto a woman from a four-story overpass  has been 
sentenced to spend six to 18 months in a suburban group home.

Jeovanni Rosario, 13, and his friend 
Raymond Hernandez, 12, were caught after having pushed a shopping cart 
off a Target parking overpass, hitting and sending philanthropist Marion
Hedges, 47, into a coma while she was out shopping for Halloween candy 
to give underprivileged children.

Tuesday's ruling will send Jeovanni to
a treatment program that deals with behavioral issues in the Manhattan 
suburb of Westchester.

He will be required to spend at least 
six months in the Graham Windham facility and if he improves then he 
will be free to return home.

'Your behavior from time to time is 
completely out of control, but that doesn't mean it has to be that way 
forever and ever,' Judge Susan Larabee said in the ruling.

'I want you to settle down in school 
so when you do go home it will be a smooth transition. You can go on to 
high school and not have to come back to see me,' she continued.

The damage that the boys did to Mrs 
Hedges is going to last much longer than his short sentence, however, as
she still struggles to complete everyday tasks and has had to relearn 
her own name.

It has also just emerged that Marion 
Hedges, 47, technically 'died at the scene' after the heavy plastic cart
crushed her as she shopped for Halloween candy for poor children at a 
mall with her son.

The mother-of-two was brought back to life by a doctor who happened to be passing who carried out first aid on her.

'She actually died in the parking lot.
There was no pulse, and she wasn’t breathing. The doctor brought her 
back to life with CPR,' a law-enforcement source told the Post.

Guarav Patel, a resident doctor at New
York Hospital happened to be shopping with his wife and year-old son, 
when he stopped to revive Mrs Hedges on October 30.

'She’ll never be the same. They 
altered her life forever. She will have cognitive issues,' a 
law-enforcement source told the Post.

The prank has left Mrs Hedges unable 
to take part in the charitable events she has devoted herself to over 
the years, however she has said she forgives those responsible.

The source told the Post: 'She's not the same person. Talking to her is like talking to a nine-year-old or a 90-year-old.

'She gets emotional and forgets things quickly. There is short-term memory loss.'

The real estate broker was then rushed
to Harlem Hospital, where she was placed in a medically induced coma 
due to her severe head injuries.

During her painful recovery, Mrs 
Hedges, who is best known for her charity work, has had to relearn her 
name and basic functions.

Jeovanni and Raymond, both 12 at the time of the near-fatal prank, have both been charged with the crime.

While in custody, the suspects turned 
on each other at one point, the source told the Post. 'Both of them 
ratted out each other.'

'For a moment, they were angry [at each other], but they went back to being friends,' the source added.

Facing felony assault charges, the pair confessed to the mindless act while laughing about it in police custody.

'Numerous detectives told them to calm
down. They thought it was a joke. They calmed down for a moment, but 
they went right back into it,' the source told the Post.

Raymond is still awaiting his sentencing.
