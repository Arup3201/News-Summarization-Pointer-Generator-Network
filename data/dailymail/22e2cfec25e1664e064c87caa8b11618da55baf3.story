Two-thirds of British people feel uncomfortable or awkward talking to somebody who is disabled, new research has shown.

A fear of seeming patronising or saying the wrong thing causes people to worry about what they say around those with a disability, a new report by charity Scope has found.

The study sheds light on why disabled people continue to face negative public attitudes, the charity said today.

The disability charity Scope has launched a new campaign after research found that two-thirds of British people feel uncomfortable or awkward talking to disabled people

The Millennial Generation - those born 
from the early-1980s to the 2000s - are twice as likely as older people 
to feel awkward around disabled people.

And one-fifth of 18 to 34-year-olds have actually avoided talking to a disabled person because they were not sure how to communicate with them.

Off the back of the findings, Scope has today launched a new national advertising campaign which uses comedy to shine a light on the awkwardness that many people feel about disability.

The adverts, which premiere on national television this Sunday, are fronted by comedian and presenter Alex Brooker, best-known for his role on Channel 4’s The Last Leg, which is now into its 4th series since the London 2012 Paralympics.

They show Mr Brooker guiding viewers through a series of awkward situations that they may encounter with a disabled person, such as 'The Awkward "I’ve bent down to speak to a wheelchair user, now what?" Situation'.

Mr Brooker, who has a prosthetic leg and hand and arm disabilities, said he hopes the campaign will get people talking about, rather than avoiding, the issue of disability.

Appearing on Good Morning Britain comedian and TV presenter Alex Brooker discussed the issue. He said: 'Some people can feel a bit awkward about disability but more often than not it's coming from a good place because it's just someone not wanting to offend'

He said: 'Some
 people can feel a bit awkward about disability but more often than not 
it's coming from a good place because it's just someone not wanting to 
offend.

'I don't see anything wrong with being curious, I would be if I saw someone different and I'm disabled myself.

'It's just about getting past that and feeling confident because a disability is only a part of who someone is I think.'

Channel 4’s coverage of the London 2012 
Paralympic Games had a huge impact and research at the time indicated 
that it changed perceptions about disability amongst viewers.

Richard Hawkes, Scope’s CEO, said: 'Awkward situations can be funny. We’ve all been in situations that have made us cringe.

Nearly half of the British - 43 per cent - do not personally know anyone who is disabled

Two-thirds - 67 per cent - of those surveyed said that they would worry about 
speaking about disability in front of a disabled person, with many 
worrying they would say something inappropriate or use an offensive term
 by mistake

Many 
people said that getting to know someone disabled - 33 per cent - or getting 
advice from disabled people - 28 per cent - would make them feel more confident 
when meeting a disabled person

'But imagine if every day, people avoided talking to you because they weren’t sure what to say or how to act.

'That’s the situation that many disabled people face today.

'We wanted to raise this issue in a light-hearted way, because it isn’t about pointing fingers.

'Not
 enough people know a disabled person, or know enough about disability. 
This can mean people worry about saying or doing the wrong thing and 
feel awkward.

'But it can also have a serious side.

'In
 2014 disabled people face many challenges. Many disabled people 
continue to face negative attitudes, in the playground, in the street, 
and from employers.

'We’ve launched this campaign to get us all thinking about what we can do to include disabled people more in our lives.'

While
 the adverts are light-hearted, Scope wants to highlight the negative 
impact of discomfort about disability on disabled people’s lives.

Recent analysis released by Scope revealed that in 2014, disabled people have higher aspirations than ever before, but that many disabled people feel that public attitudes to disability are still playing 'catch up'.

Scope’s research reveals that when asked whose attitude most needs to change, disabled people were most likely to say the general public.
