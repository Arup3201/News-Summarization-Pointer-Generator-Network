Katy French, one of Ireland's best known models, died after fitting at her friend's house in 2007

The family of the late Irish model Katy French said justice has not been served after two people charged following her death were spared jail today.

Former couple Kieron Ducie and Ann Corcoran were handed given suspended sentences for arranging a drug deal the weekend the socialite collapsed at her home.

The model's parents, John and Janet, 
and sister Jill said the court case proved she had not been on an 
alcohol and cocaine binge but left questions unanswered.

'For five years we have been silent,' said Mr French outside Trim Circuit Court.

'For five years we watched Katy being slandered, torn apart, being used as the flagship for drug taking.

'She wasn't on a binge drink. That came out in the court and I think now is the time to let her rest.'

Ms French, 24, died in hospital on 
December 6 2007, four days after she had a fit at the former couple's 
house in Lambertstown Manor, Kilmessan, Co Meath.

The Swiss born model suffered brain damage days after celebrating her birthday.

Tests revealed half a glass of wine 
and 0.8mg of cocaine in her system - four per cent of what can be considered a 
lethal dose - along with traces of antibiotics for a kidney infection, 
cough medicine and contraceptives, according to her family.

The court heard there was a 90 minute gap between the time Ducie and Corcoran said they found the model and arriving at a nearby hospital.Â 

They said they discovered her on a bedroom floor, fitting, with her head back and arms and legs outstretched.

When they arrived at hospital, staff were told 
she had been drinking but not seen taking drugs.

Ducie, 43, who lives with
 his new partner and two children and Corcoran, 32, who lives with her 
parents in Dublin, later pleaded guilty to procuring 
another man - Russell Memery - to possess cocaine which was sold to the 
socialite at a garage forecourt.

A second charge, that the pair 
intentionally or recklessly engaged in conduct which created a 
substantial risk of death or serious harm to Ms French, was recently 
dropped.

Ducie was given a two-and-a-half suspended sentence and Corcoran received a two-year suspended sentence.

The French family said they are saddened and angry the second charge was dropped.

'I do not feel like justice has been done,' said her sister Jill.

She added outside court: 'She was a part of every single one of us. So we have all 
been living without a part of ourselves and without her.'

The court was told Ducie texted Ms French at 10pm on Saturday, December 1, asking if she was going out.

She replied an hour later saying she wanted to visit Corcoran and asked if he could arrange to get her some cocaine.

Superintendent Michael Devine, of Navan Garda Station, said Ducie contacted Memery and then Corcoran, who arranged for Memery to meet Ms French at a Statoil service station at Clonee where she bought 200 euro worth of cocaine shortly after midnight.

In garda interviews the pair said Ducie 
had been out socialising until 6am while Ms French sat up drinking 
Champagne and vodka and chatting with Corcoran until 8am, when they all 
went to bed.

Katy French's family - sister Jill, left, mother Janet, centre, and father John - said justice had not been served after Ducie and Corcoran were given suspended jail sentences

According to the former couple, they heard a bang at about 8.30am from the downstairs room where Ms French was found having a fit.

But the court heard emergency services were not called until 10.05am and Ms French arrived at Navan hospital in the back of Ducie's jeep at 10.12am.

Mobile phone evidence revealed Ducie called Memery before 10am and several times that morning while medics worked to save the model's life.

In May 2010, Memery was given a two and a half year suspended sentence after admitting to conspiring with others to possess cocaine for sale or supply on the weekend Ms French took ill.

Judge Michael O'Shea said it would be inhuman of him not to comment on the tragic case adding: 'Her family will carry this cross for the rest of their life.'

Corcoran, a secretary in an accountancy firm, is engaged and put her wedding plans on hold until after the case which 'has been hanging over her', her lawyer Patrick Marrinan, senior counsel, said.

He claimed taking cocaine 'would not have been unknown' for the model, with one ex-boyfriend referring to her as a 'two-day on, one-day off' cocaine abuser in the book of evidence.

Corcoran had no previous convictions while lorry driver Ducie has minor road traffic and public order offences and a conviction for assaulting his partner Elaine Buggle when she was pregnant.

Born in Switzerland, Ms French and her family moved to Ireland when she was a child and settled in Enniskerry, County Wicklow.
