Speaking up: James J Pepe, 55, of Brandon, Florida, appeared in court on Saturday as prosecutors played recorded phone calls of him allegedly seeking to hire a hitman

A high school teacher considered hiring one of his former students to kill a former colleague it's been revealed in shocking recorded conversations played in court.

In the 11 minute phone call a Florida courtroom listened as James Pepe, 55, of Bloomingdale High School discussed knowing someone who would hook him up with 'every --- murderer we need.'

Pepe is accused of offering to pay $2,000 to kill Robert Meredith, 49, a former co-worker at Strawberry Crest High whom police say he believed had spread rumours about him being a child molester.

Meredith told WFTS it 'came as a complete shock,' having known of Pepe but the pair having never once spoken.

'We gotta kill this ----' Pepe is heard in the tape telling a friend who later went to police.

'Originally I remember you and I talked about it and you wanted to pay me to kill him and then I was uncomfortable with that because I've got kids and then you wanted me to find some ---- that didn't work. I found a white supremacist, that didn't work,' the man is heard regurgitating Pepe's plans on the phone.

Eventually the man told Pepe he had found someone else to do the job.

'He knows people that will do it or is he going to do it?' Pepe is heard asking him.

'He would do it. Yeah, I mean, here's the deal, you should just talk to the guy. Why don't you just talk to him? How do you want Meredith killed?'

'Anyway he wants. I don't get a f---,' Pepe said.

According to ABC Pepe was also open to the idea of having the teacher killed at a school event.

Police say the two teachers fell out while working at Strawberry Crest, in Dover.

The rift saw Pepe transfer to another school, according to reports, while Meredith, an economics teacher, remained at Strawberry Crest.

'I don’t feel that I’m in any way culpable for this,' Meredith told ABC. 'If there is a 
problem, it is 100 per cent on the other side.'

Officer Tray Towles, a Plant City Police Department spokesman, told the Tampa Bay Times that police understood Pepe felt Meredith was behind anything negative which happened to him at work.

He said the breaking point came when Pepe suspected his colleague was spreading rumours about him.

Officer Towles said: 'Meredith was allegedly telling everybody (Pepe) was a child molester.'

Police have said officers worked with the FBI to set up a sting operation following a tip-off, where a Plant City undercover officer played the role of a hitman.

They allege during a call on 
September 13 Pepe told the undercover officer he 'had an issue he might 
need take care of' and was willing to pay $2,000.

They have said during a second call the officer attempted to arrange a meeting, which Pepe refused, but still allegedly said he wanted Meredith killed.

Officers arrested the history teacher - known by students as Dr Pepe - at the end of school on outside the school.

He faces a charge of solicitation of first-degree murder and was being held without bail at the Hillsborough County jail.

Pepe started working for the Hillsborough County School District 28 years ago.

Former student Dee Dee Cardenas, 22, of Dover, who was in Pepe's government class at Durant High in 2007, said she was stunned to hear her former teacher was behind bars.

She said: 'I just remember him being really good teacher. It is a little disturbing to hear this.'
