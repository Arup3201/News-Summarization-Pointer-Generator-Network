The face of Jesus has been spotted on trees, windowpanes and even slices of toast.

But the Son of God has now made his latest earthly appearance on a tree stump in Belfast City Cemetery.

The outline of what appears to be a bearded figure resembling the image of Jesus appeared on a recently felled tree beside a grave.

The image has fascinated people 
visiting the Falls Road graveyard with footage even being posted on 
YouTube and social networking sites.

Graveyard workers say several people have been spotted sitting and praying to the image.

One worker said ‘Before long this 
place will become like Knock’, (Knock Shrine in Co. Mayo is Ireland’s 
National Marian Shrine, pilgrims visit the site of the Apparition in 
1879).

Local people say it’s
a sign from god, workers say it was the burn marks left from the 
chainsaw, others have there own opinion, but no one really knows how the 
image got there.
