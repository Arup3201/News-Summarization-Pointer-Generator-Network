A Chicago coffee expert has died after being crushed to death when a brewing machine he was trying to dismantle fell on him.

Jim Karr was a popular coffee guru who had been director of brewing technology of the city's Intelligenstia for years.

The 48-year-old had been trying to dismantle a 
commercial-grade coffee maker after an outside event at the city when he was 
crushed.

Loss: Jim Karr died from serious injuries on Saturday after a coffee machine fell on top of him

Mr Karr, who had left Intelligenstia to set up his own coffee company - SteamVolt - died from serious head and chest injuries.

An autopsy showed that he died from multiple injuries caused by being crushed. The death, which happened at a charity Bike the Drive event, has been ruled an accident, the Chicago Tribune 
reported.

Friends and former colleagues quickly paid tribute to Mr Karr, who they described as a 'legend and mentor to the entire specialty coffee community'.

Jesse, of coffee company Dark Matter, described Mr Karr in a Facebook post as 'an inspiration' and added that he 'constantly ideated with me new ways for us to do both better'.

'Jim will be missed dearly, but his work will forever be lived out by the people he has touched in life,' the post added.

It is believed some staff members of Dark Matter had been with Mr Karr at the time of the accident.

Mr Karr was a well-known and popular figure in the coffee industry, with contacts as far afield as San Francisco paying tribute to him.

Nicholas Cho, of Wrecking Ball Coffee Roaster in San Francisco, told DNAInfo Chicago: 'In terms of the work Jim did, he was one of the very few in the country that was known as being a top expert at what he did.'

Trey Elder, who used to work with Mr Karr at Intelligentsia, added that he was known by everyone in the business, from the baristas to the sales teams.

'Most people that are serious about their coffee profession at some point ran into Jim,' Mr Elder said, adding that he had been quick-witted, quiet and kind-hearted.

After seven years as Intelligenstia's 
brewing director, Mr Karr had founded SteamVolt in 2012, which offered technical 
support to coffee companies, and focused on innovation.
