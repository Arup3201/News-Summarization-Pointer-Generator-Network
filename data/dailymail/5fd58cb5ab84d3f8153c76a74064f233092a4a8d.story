Secret services fugitive Edward Snowden claimed on Sunday that US government officials 'want to kill me' in an interview with a German TV channel.

The intelligence leaker's Moscow lawyer had already voiced similar fears after controversial comments from unattributed sources.

Snowden - currently hiding from US justice in Russia, where he is believed to be under the protection of the The Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) - said he has received threats on his life.

'These people, and they are government officials, have said they would love to put a bullet in my head or poison me when I come out of the supermarket, and then watch as I die in the shower,' he said.

The translated Snowden quotes were issued by German public television netowork ARD with the promise of further comments from the renegade intelligence contractor.

The interview was broadcast in Moscow in secret.

Snowden's concerns follow a BuzzFeed article entitled 'American Spies Want Edward Snowden Dead', which cited an alleged Pentagon official.

'I would love to put a bullet in his head,' said the source, who was not named.

A current analyst for the National Security Agency - where Snowden used to work - was quoted as saying he would not hesitate in murder Snowden.

'In a world where I would not be restricted from killing an American, I personally would go and kill him myself,' they said.

And an unnamed army source suggested Snowden could be 'poked' on his way back from a supermarket and administered with poison.

Snowden 'thinks nothing of it at the time and starts to feel a little woozy,'Â  he said.

'And the next thing you know he dies in the shower.'

The fugitive's Russian lawyer said last week that additional security maybe needed for Snowden after the 'threats'.

Snowden, 30, is wanted on treason charges after leaking highly classified details about the US - and the British - snooping on mobile phones and the internet.

The American in recent days has ruled out a return to his homeland, despite a campaign to allow him back.

The 30-year-old said that while returning to the US would be the 'best resolution' for everyone, doing so is impossible because he believes there is 'no chance' of a fair trial.

Snowden is barely seen in Moscow and officials have said since his arrival last summer that he is in danger from a possible hit by US agents.

He received temporary asylum in Russia in August - a move that infuriated the United States and was a key factor behind President Barack Obama's decision to cancel a summit with Russia's Vladimir Putin last year.
