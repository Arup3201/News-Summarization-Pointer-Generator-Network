A mother-of-two says she finally found peace after years of being tormented by evil spirits after marrying her exorcist.

Cortney Stiles, 33, says she used to feel plagued by demons which taunted her mentally and even, she says, attacked her physically while she slept.

It was only after she met Tom, 32, on internet discussion boards that she was able to banish the demons from her life forever.

Courtney credits Tom with freeing her from the demonic possession that had plagued her for years

The pair fell in love, married and now have two children, Joshua, two, and three-month-old Jacob.

She said: 'Exorcisms are not quite what people imagine them to be. Tom gave me information and support - but I, like all victims of demonic oppression and possession, could only be freed through exorcism once I was ready and willing to be freed.'

Eventually the couple, pictured here on their wedding day, booked a place on a weekend retreat where a group of people, including Tom, prayed over Mrs Stiles for 15 hours straight

Mrs Stiles, who today raises her two children full-time and supports her husband in his ministry as a pastor and practitioner of exorcism, says she was traumatised by contact with evil presences since childhood.

She said: 'I had a very intense experience at my eighth birthday party. I was alone in the church hall before all the other guests had arrived, when I saw a boy sat a table.

'He looked human, but I knew there was something different about him.

He promised me everything I always wanted - a happy future with a nice house and freedom to do anything I wanted in life. But there was a condition that I give my soul over to Satan.

'He spoke to me as if he knew all my inner thoughts. He finished my sentences for me. When I spoke to people about it afterwards, no one said they had seen the boy at the party.'

By the time she was 24, Mrs Stiles claims she was being attacked by demons at night.

She said: 'As I lay in bed, I saw demons appearing in different forms. They had horrifying faces, covered in blood, with sharp teeth and claws.

'They clawed at me, bit me and stabbed me with knives. It was an extremely tangible, physical sensation.

'It happened every night for a year and if I prayed while they attacked, it only got worse. It was terrifying. I'm still suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder because of it.'

In 2009, she related her experiences to an online community which included people who were committed to researching and fighting demons.

She said: 'I noticed one user who was posting regularly. He was very knowledgeable about how to combat the forces which were attacking me.

'I thought that maybe he would listen to me and not think I was nuts. When I spoke to Tom I didn't get attacked. He had a very powerful protective effect over me.

Cortney says she was drawn to Tom as he was very knowledgeable about how to combat the forces which were attacking her

'I soon told him I could imagine a future where we were married. He told me he felt the same way.'

In May 2010, Mrs Stiles moved 2,000 miles from her home in Washington State to Indiana to be with her protector. The pair married two days after she arrived.

She said: 'For a whole year, I was still being attacked. I couldn't sleep unless Tom was in the room.

If he left, even for a few moments, the demons would come back to taunt me.

'If Tom realised I was being attacked, he would go to where I was, and pray, and was able to fight them off.'

Eventually the couple booked a place on a weekend retreat where a group of people, including Tom, prayed over Mrs Stiles for 15 hours straight.

Mrs Stiles recalled: 'It was only then that I was freed. I was able to renounce my past life and become a true Christian.

Pair now have two sons, Joshua and baby Jacob, but remain vigilant against future deamon attack

'I had been very reckless in my youth. I had been vain and I had partied a lot. But by giving myself over to God, I was able to defend myself from demons.'

Not long after Mr and Mrs Stiles returned from the retreat, Mrs Stiles discovered she was pregnant.

She said: 'It was a time of huge change for me, and it was a challenge to adjust to my new life. But it was a joyful challenge too. Joshua is a wonderful little boy. He's very happy and he loves to read."

In October 2013 their family was joined by Jacob, now three months.

Mrs Stiles, of Francisco, Indiana, said: 'Me and Tom are still going through a learning process. We spent a long time trying to figure out why the demons came to me - and today we're mindful and vigilant to make sure it never happens again.

'There's still a lot I don't understand. But I've learned to give myself over to God and not try to understand.'

Mr Stiles said: 'All I did was channel God's power, not my own. Our goal is to share with as many people as possible the truth of demonic oppression, and the only solution to it, which is faith in Christ.'
