Lee Myung-bak, president of South Korea, has visited islands claimed by Japan, fuelling a long-standing tension between the two countries.

Both lay claim to the islands - known as Dokdo in South Korea, and as Takeshim in Japan - which lie roughly half way between the two nations.

Japan responded immediately by recalling its ambassador from South Korea, according to a Kyodo news agency. Japan has also summoned the South Korean ambassador to Tokyo.

The two countries have also postponed an annual meeting between their finance ministers as an apparent consequence of the visit.

The islands are small, however they lie in fishing grounds which could also contain large gas deposits.

Quoted by the BBC, Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda said: 'Today South Korean President Lee Myung-bak visited Takeshima. It is contrary to our nation's stance that Takeshima is historically - and under international law - an integral part of our national territory, and is completely unacceptable.'

He continued: 'I believe it is necessary for the Japanese government to take a resolute stance on this matter.'

Since 1954 South Korea has stationed a small coastguard attachment on the islands.

The South Korean premier's visit was the first since 2008 when then Prime Minister Han Seung-soo visited, sparking a similar row.

In 2008 South Korea withdrew its ambassador to Japan after an Japanese educational book claimed Japan owned the islands.

And last month the diplomatic tensions were raised after a South Korean man rqmmed his truck against the Japanese embassy, in protest over the latter's claim to the islands.

Security was stepped up by South Korea for today's visit, according to the country's Yonhap news agency.

The tensions flared as the two countries prepared to face each other today on the football pitch at the London 2012 Olympics, playing for a bronze medal.
