Anti-semitism campaigners have described a Turkish shampoo commercial featuring Hitler as a 'deplorable marketing ploy'.

The 12-second advert for Biomen shampoo shows the Nazi leader gesticulating wildly during a speech, before the commercial urges customers to buy the '100 per cent male shampoo'.

Underneath the footage of Hitler from an undated speech, there is a caption which translates as, 'If you are not wearing a woman's dress, you should not use her shampoo either'.

Controversial: The advert for Biomen shows Hitler and tells viewers, 'If you are not wearing a woman's dress, you should not use her shampoo either'

The advert by the Turkish firm ends by claiming the shampoo is for 'real men'

The controversial ad finishes with the strapline, 'Here it is, a real menâ€™s shampoo, Biomen.'

Jewish organisations and anti-semitism groups have urged Turkish firm Biofirm to pull the advert, but the company have so far refused to withdraw the campaign since it first aired last week.

The Turkish Jewish Community said in statement: 'It's totally unacceptable to make use of Hitler, the most striking example of cruelty and savagery.'

Other groups were also quick to condemn the short commercial.

The Anti-Defamation League has written to Turkey's Ambassador to the U.S., Namik Tan, after saying it was 'repulsed' by the commercial.

Abraham H. Foxman, the League's National Director, said on the ADL website: 'The use of images of the violently anti-Semitic dictator who was responsible for the mass murder of 6 million Jews and millions of others in the Holocaust to sell shampoo is a disgusting and deplorable marketing ploy.

'This video is just the latest example of the use of Holocaust imagery in some countries to sell commercial products, which has contributed to the trivialization of and desensitization to the unparalleled horrors of the Holocaust.

'There can never be any justifiable purpose for using the images of Hitler, Nazis or any other depiction of the Nazi killing machine to sell products or services.'

Turkey has long had an apparent fascination with Hitler, as the Nazi leader's autobiography Mein Kampft, became a bestseller in the country in 2005.

The country itself has a Jewish population of between 18,000 and 20,000, most of whom live in Istanbul.
