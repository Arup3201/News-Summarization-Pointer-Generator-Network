A husband set his estranged wife alight after dousing her with petrol because she wanted a divorce.

Terrifying CCTV images show Ahmad Yazdanparast buying fuel before making his way to the beauty salon where ex-wife Ahdeih Khayatzadeh worked.

The killer is shown making his way down the steps of the salon before entering through a white door. He then douses the 46-year-old in fuel before setting her alight.

In shocking footage, the killer can be seen running from the Venus Hair & Beauty in Stirling, Scotland, with flames over himself - believed to be caused because he accidentally covered himself in petrol.

The mother-of-three died after suffering 95 per cent burns in the horrific in October last year.

The two-week trial at the High Court in Edinburgh heard that 61-year-old Mr Yazdanparast attacked the mother because she was divorcing him.

He was found guilty of murder - and will be sentenced at a later date.

Detective Inspector Bryan Burns, from Police Scotland, said: 'The horrific nature and consequences of this crime has had an immeasurable impact on Ahdeih’s family and I would like to praise their strength, courage and support during the investigation.

'I would also like to thank those members of the community in Stirling who helped at the scene of this tragic incident and those who came forward after our appeal for witnesses.

'The many people who responded so promptly and positively did much to assist the investigation.

'Our thoughts remain with Ahdeih’s family during this difficult time.'

Ms Khayatzadeh was found alive by a fire crew responding to the Maxwell Place blaze on Saturday October 12, but died later in hospital.

Paramedic Steven Morgan told the murder trial that he asked Ms Khayatzadeh who was responsible and she said it was her ex-husband.

Asked why, the witness said she told him 'because she had divorced him'.

A court document published in April last year said Mr Khayatzadeh 'does not want to be divorced' and there was 'considerable tension' between the former couple, who separated in August 2010 and had a number of joint property interests.

Following her death, Ms Khayatzadeh’s family said a 'huge void' had been left in their lives.

They described her as a 'wonderful woman who was devoted to her family and spent every spare minute she could with them.'
