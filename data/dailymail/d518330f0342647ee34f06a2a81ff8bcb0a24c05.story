Newlyweds: Stephanie Stevenson and Rob Mowlam married 
aboard the Carnival Triumph on Saturday

A Texan couple who got married aboard the stricken Carnival Triumph vessel on Friday have said they have not even started thinking about a honeymoon yet - but 'it won't be a cruise'.

Rob Mowlam, 37 and Stephanie Stevenson, 
27 of Nederland, Texas were married by the ship's captain on on Saturday night, but the next day an engine fire disabled the 
900-foot vessel.

As it continues its slow journey towards Mobile, Alabama on Thursday, Mowlam has spoken about the 'pretty rough conditions' on board and their desperation to get back to Stevenson's two young sons.

'I just want to get home and sleep in my own bed and have climate control and lights,' Mr Mowlam told ABCNews.com. 'I will probably flush the toilet 10 times just because I can.'

The groom's brother, James Mowlam III, said they were keen to have the couple back on shore.

'It
would be my guess that this would probably not be on anyone's great 
list of memorable wedding experiences,' he said with a laugh.

'Although, 
my mom told him that she was hoping they had a memorable wedding and I 
think this would classify as a memorable wedding experience.'

Mowlam admitted that the wedding was 'just what we wanted - short, sweet and quiet'.

But instead of a champagne 
breakfast, the newly married couple becameÂ  stranded along with 4,200 
other passengers surrounded by cabin carpets soaked in urine, reduced to
going to the bathroom in plastic baggies left in corridors.

'Shanty town': Passengers have set up shelters outside to avoid the stench inside the vessel

Indeed the stench is reported to be 
so great that some of the unlucky passengers are becoming physically 
sick due to the stench, while overflowing toilets and scarce food 
supplies are causing some to make panicked and teary cell-phone calls 
home - if they can.

The bride's brother, Justin Davis, told ABCNews.com that his sister was gifted the cruise from colleagues at the doctor's office she works in.

While David has not been able to speak to his sibling, he did say that her two young sons are being cared for by their grandmother.

'She might be a little aggravated at the situation, but I'd say she's [probably] handling it really well,' said Davis.

The grooms father, Jimmy Mowlam, 63, 
said, 'We have brief conversations because it is extremely expensive and
everybody else is trying to get lines too.

'On deck it looks like a shanty town, with sheets, almost like tents, mattresses, anything else they can pull to sleep on...'

'There's no water and you can't flush, so everyone is going in little plastic baggies and putting it outside their room.'

'Conditions are getting worse by the hour. Cabin carpets are wet with urine and water.'

Debra Rightmire, on board

'All
of the girls in their group were calling their family members as well 
and they were crying. Everybody wants off of this. It's a big mess, 
there's no power, there's no toilets, there's no food - it's like a 
bunch of savages on there.'

Brent Nutt, whose wife Bethany is on board

'They said they would be in touch when they could.'

Mowlam said his son told him the lack
of ventilation on the Triumph had made it too hot to sleep inside and 
that many passengers had set up camp on the ocean liner's decks and in 
its common areas. Mowlam said he wasn't sure where his son was sleeping.

'He
said up on deck it looks like a shanty town, with sheets, almost like 
tents, mattresses, anything else they can pull to sleep on,' said 
Mowlam, of the southeast Texas town of Warren. His son is from nearby 
Nederland.

Mowlam said his son indicated that passengers are trying to make the best of a bad situation.

'So far people have been pretty much taking it in stride,' Mowlam said his son told him.

Rob Mowlam added: 'Believe it or not, most of the people 
have been really upbeat and positive. The crew onboard has 
been absolutely, unbelievably helpful and good at what they do.'

One of Mrs Barlow's twin 11-year-old sons, Colby, told ABC: 'I just hope that she comes back safely and sound.'

Other passengers have described dire conditions, including overflowing toilets and limited access to food.

Some of the people on board reported 
that cabin carpets are soaked in urine, passengers are sleeping in tents
on deck and scarce food supplies that has reduced them to eating cold 
onion sandwiches.

Vacationers were fighting over food, 
elderly people running out of medications and formula and diaper 
supplies were limited for babies, according to some reports.

Dustin Martinez, from San Antonio, 
Texas said that he was concerned for his mother who was on board. He 
last heard from her on Sunday.

He told KSAT: 'I got a phone call from her. Very brief. Basically saying, ''I'm fine, We have food. No toilets.'''

The ship left Galveston, Texas, for a four-day cruise last Thursday with 3,143 passengers and 1,086 crew members.

The ship was about 150 miles off 
Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula on Sunday when an engine room fire knocked 
out its primary power source, crippling its water and plumbing systems 
and leaving it adrift on only a backup power.

No one was injured in the fire, but 
Carnival spokeswoman Joyce Oliva said on Tuesday that a passenger with a
pre-existing medical condition was taken off the ship as a precaution.

Everyone else likely will have to 
remain onboard until the ship reaches Mobile which is expected to happen
on Thursday, weather permitting.

Besides two tugs, at least two other 
Carnival cruise ships have been diverted to the Triumph to leave 
supplies and a 210-foot Coast Guard cutter was at the scene, Coast Guard
Petty Officer Richard Brahm said.

Jay Herring, a former senior officer 
for Carnival Cruise Lines, said one of the biggest concerns crew members
will have until the ship docks is the potential for disease outbreak, 
particularly norovirus, which causes vomiting and diarrhea.

'Housekeeping, others are probably 
working double shifts to keep the mess clean and wipe down and sanitize 
all the common areas,' said Herring, who worked for Carnival from 2002 
to 2004 and spent four months on the Triumph.

The National Transportation Safety 
Board announced Tuesday it has opened an investigation into the cause of
the fire. The NTSB said the Bahamas Maritime Agency will lead the 
investigation because the ship carries a Bahamian flag.

President Gerry Cahill said most of the boat's 23 public restrooms and some of the guest cabin bathrooms were working.

All apologies: Carnival Cruise Lines president 
Gerry Cahill said he was deeply sorry but downplayed how bad conditions 
were on the ship on Tuesday at a press conference

He downplayed the possibility of an 
outbreak of disease from unsanitary conditions, saying the ship had not 
seen an abnormal number of people reporting to the infirmary as being 
ill.

'No one here from Carnival is happy about the conditions onboard the ship,' Cahill said at a news conference in Miami.

'We obviously are very, very sorry about what is taking place.'

Cahill said Carnival has reserved 
more than 1,500 hotel rooms in Mobile and New Orleans for Thursday. The 
company plans to return passengers back to Houston on Friday using 
charter flights.
