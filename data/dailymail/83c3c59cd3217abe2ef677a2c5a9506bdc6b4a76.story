Protest was right: Andrew Haldane, from the Bank of England, said the Occupy protests were right to attack the financial system

The Occupy protesters who camped at St Paul’s Cathedral were morally and intellectually right to attack the financial system, says a Bank of England official.

Andrew Haldane, a member of the financial policy committee at the bank, said the movement was successful in attacking the problems of the global financial system and ‘helped stir’ improvement in financial services.

Protesters staged considerable protests in London and New York against economic inequality and the influence of the financial services industry.

Hundreds of movement members camped outside St Paul’s for more than three months after they were prevented from entering nearby Paternoster Square, where the London Stock Exchange is located.

Police forcibly evicted them in February this year after the protesters lost a court battle with the local authorities.

Mr Haldane spoke to Occupy Economics, a branch of the movement, at a London event last night.

He said: ‘Occupy has been successful in its efforts to popularise the problems of the global financial system for one very simple reason; they are right.’

‘Occupy’s voice has been both loud and persuasive and policymakers have listened and are acting.

‘In fact, I want to argue that we are in the early stages of a reformation of finance, a reformation which Occupy has helped stir.’

He said that protesters had been right about the consequences of high salaries and bonuses in the financial sector. 

Mr Haldane said: ‘I do not just mean right in a moral sense. It is the analytical, every bit as much as the moral, ground that Occupy has taken.

‘For the hard-headed facts suggest that, at the heart of the global financial crisis, were and are, problems of deep and rising inequality.’

Mr Haldane told activists that Occupy played an instrumental role in improving and reforming finance services.

He said: ‘If I am right and a new leaf is being turned, then Occupy will have played a key role in this fledgling financial reformation.

‘You have put the arguments. You have helped win the debate.’

The Bank of England official made no mention of Occupy’s use of controversial protest techniques which included claims that they desecrated the church and spoiled the grounds. 

Earlier this month, four women from the movement invaded the cathedral and chained themselves to the pulpit for more than six hours, interrupting a service.
