Scottish banks will be broken up and oil giant BP nationalised to punish them for backing the No campaign, a leading SNP figure warned last night.

In an extraordinary intervention, the Scottish National Party’s former deputy leader said businesses that had spoken out against independence would face a ‘day of reckoning’.

Jim Sillars said: ‘This referendum is about power, and when we get a Yes majority, we will use that power for a day of reckoning with BP and the banks.

Tirade: Jim Sillars (right), the former deputy leader of the SNP and a key ally of Alex Salmond (centre), said oil giant BP would need to 'learn the meaning of nationalisation' and major banks would be broken up

'The heads of these companies are rich men, in cahoots with a rich English Tory Prime Minister, to keep Scotland’s poor poorer through lies and distortions.’

The threats were last night condemned by opponents of independence, who said the Yes camp’s ‘mask has slipped’.

On BP, which has questioned SNP leader Alex Salmond’s extravagant claims about Scotland’s oil reserves, Mr Sillars said: ‘BP, in an independent Scotland, will need to learn the meaning of nationalisation, in part or in whole.’

He added: ‘If it wants into the “monster fields” in the areas west of Shetland, it will have to learn to bend the knee to a greater power – us, the sovereign people of Scotland.

‘We will be masters of the oil fields, not BP or any of the other majors.’

Mr Sillars – a leading member of the independence campaign hailed for his ‘fantastic’ work by Mr Salmond this week – also called for a boycott on stores that had backed the No campaign.

Labour MP Ian Davidson said: ‘Now we see the real face of nationalism in all its ugliness.’ 

Mr Sillars’s threats came as economists and business leaders issued new dire warnings about the impact of a Yes vote.

In a string of bleak warnings:

Frozen out: Iceland boss Malcolm Walker warned his response to a Yes vote would be 'panic'

The SNP has been infuriated by warnings from big business about the economic risks of a Yes vote, accusing business leaders of ‘scare-mongering’.

Its economic case was shattered on Thursday after Scots were warned by a string of retailers that higher prices were inevitable if the nation voted to split from the UK.

Asda, Waitrose, John Lewis and Marks and Spencer all sounded warnings, while the Bank of England warned of huge tax rises and analysts said the universal postal service would also be in doubt.

In his explosive response yesterday, Mr Sillars declared that leading banks, including the Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds and TSB, faced being broken up for warning they will move their headquarters to England if Scotland goes independent.

And major retailers such as John Lewis could face consumer boycotts after warning that independence will force up prices at the checkout.

Mr Walker said Iceland had 71 stores and a major distribution centre in Scotland.

‘The consequences will be just massive,’ he told Channel 4 News, adding that his first response to a Yes vote on Thursday would be to ‘panic!’

‘To be perfectly honest with you, we didn’t take it too seriously. I don’t think anybody for one moment considered that there would be a Yes vote.’ Figures yesterday showed that growing fears of a split have led to more than £17billion being pulled out of the UK in the past month.

The sum is the largest amount of money moved out of Britain in a single month since the financial crisis hit in 2008.

Heating up: Mr Salmond's Yes campaign has suffered several stark warnings from big business this week

More than £127billion has been pulled out of the UK’s stock markets and debt markets so far this year, according to figures from consultancy CrossBorder Capital.

Swiss banking giant UBS also warned that Scotland’s economy could shrink by as much as 5 per cent if it voted to leave. An independent Scotland would shed jobs and tax revenues as banks and major firms relocated to England under a cloud of uncertainty over the future, the bank said.

Analyst Paul Donovan said: ‘Until there is clarity over the currency arrangements and the banking system, Scotland is likely to suffer some degree of a credit crunch.’

He warned that ‘half of the banking sector’ would move to England before independence takes hold fully in 2016.

The report added to the mountain of evidence about the dire economic consequences of a victory for the Yes campaign.

Wall Street investment bank Morgan Stanley also said it had seen the highest amount of selling ‘on record’ as investors queued up to pull their funds out of Britain. 

Nigel Farage’s visit to Scotland yesterday to campaign for the Union will have persuaded voters to back independence, Alex Salmond claimed last night.

The First Minister said the Ukip leader joining the campaign trail in Glasgow to ask Scots to vote No was a gift to the Yes campaign.

Mr Farage said that he had gone there to win back Labour supporters who had decided to vote for independence.

Fury: Protesters against Nigel Farage's visit in Glasgow last night. He described Scotland as 'our territory'

But before he had even arrived he had upset Scots by describing Scotland as simply ‘a large chunk of our territory’.

At a Ukip rally last night, Mr Farage said the Prime Minister had been ‘moronic’ for not putting the option of maximum devolution on the ballot paper along with Yes and No.

He said: ‘I was astonished that the Prime Minister allowed for the separatists to be given the “yes” side of the referendum question.

‘Far better from his point of view, you would have thought, would have been to have asked the question “Should Scotland remain part of the United Kingdom?”. But no, on this he blundered and more fundamentally he blundered by not offering the Scottish people, the “devo max” option.’

Anger: Mr Farage has had a hostile reception in Scotland before and it was repeated last night in Glasgow

Earlier, Mr Farage had suggested the Queen has a responsibility to speak out and tell Scots not to vote for independence if the polls are still close tomorrow.

Mr Salmond said the Ukip leader was an asset to the Yes camp because of ‘Ukip’s negative, insular, anti-European brand of politics’.

Last night 60 demonstrators gathered outside the Ukip rally and Mr Farage was smuggled in a side door to avoid them. It overshadowed an event held by Labour last night, which saw party leader Ed Miliband share a platform with former prime minister Gordon Brown for the first time since he left Downing Street in 2010.
