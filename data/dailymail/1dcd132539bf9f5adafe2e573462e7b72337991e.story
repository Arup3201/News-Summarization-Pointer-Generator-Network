A female police officer whose duties included guarding Kate Middleton is suing Britain's biggest police force for racial discrimination after claiming she was called a n***** by a colleague.

Ricky Haruna, 39, claims she was fired from London's Metropolitan Police after complaining about racism and has now launched a case for harassment and wrongful dismissal.

She says fellow cops laughed when a suspect used the racist term 'midnight' to her face and revealed that she did not receive support from senior officers.

The allegations are among a string of claims which have now been submitted to an employment tribunal after she was sacked from the Met in June.

In a statement released by The Mirror, she said: 'I was harassed and ­victimised by racist police officers and those that support and cover up for racists in senior management.

She also alleges that she was excluded from a staff Christmas dinner, saying: 'I was the only black police officer and only female police officer based in that office at the time and I felt singled out and picked on.'

Despite her ordeal Ms Haruna is now desperate to return to the Met, where she received commendations for outstanding service.

She joined the Met in January 2002 after graduating in sociology and criminology from Goldsmiths, ­University of London and saved the lives of two people during her career.

In April last year she was arrested for an alleged fraud, but claims the arrest was designed to silence and discredit her.

The allegation went on to form one of three she faced at a disciplinary hearing which led to her being sacked.

Ms Haruna's solicitor Lawrence Davies, of Equal Justice, said: 'When PC Haruna reported the bullying in the workplace, rather than support her, the Met's response was to target her and sack her.'

Her case comes weeks after the Met's former poster girl, firearms officer Carol Howard, won a ­discrimination case against the force.

A spokesman for the Met said they had not received a formal complaint.
