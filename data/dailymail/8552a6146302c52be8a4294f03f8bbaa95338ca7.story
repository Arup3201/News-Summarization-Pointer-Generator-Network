The average interest rate on an easy-access ISA account has fallen to a record low.

The typical rate on an account which allows people to get immediate access to their money has plunged to 1.17 per cent after falling for five months in a row, according to respected financial website MoneyFacts.

This is the lowest average rate since it began keeping records in 2007, the year before the financial crash.

Experts said it was another sign that savers had been ‘sacrificed’ in favour of mortgage borrowers.

It also suggests that George Osborne’s flagship policy of raising to £15,000 the amount savers can deposit in a tax-free ISA – announced in what he dubbed a ‘Budget for savers’ in March – is unlikely to be of much use to those with nest eggs.

Far from reinvigorating the savings market, the Government scheme to increase the allowance in ISAs had proved to be a flop, it was claimed yesterday.

In 2012 there were 403 ISA products on the market but now there are 283, suggesting banks are not competing to give savers a good rate. Sylvia Waycot, editor at Moneyfacts.co.uk, said: ‘Rates are still at historically low levels, product numbers continue to fall and the ISA market as a whole remains subdued.

‘Despite the hype surrounding the new allowance, it’s as though providers have decided to just sit this one out.’

Critics blamed the Government’s Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS) for rendering savers of little value to banks, leading them not to bother competing for their business.

The scheme allowed banks and building societies to borrow money cheaply from the Bank of England for lending to people seeking mortgages. Launched in 2012, it was designed to breathe new life into the housing market after the economic crisis – but savings rates dropped because banks no longer needed to lure savers to raise funds.

Although the FLS scheme is now closed to mortgage lenders, they still have billions of pounds to call on – and little incentive to attract savers, critics said.

Mrs Waycot said: ‘FLS has had a greater negative impact on savings rates than the historic low Bank of England rate.’

The Bank of England base rate has been at 0.5 per cent since 2009, but is expected to rise by the beginning of spring.

However, experts said the rise – which will push up interest rates on savings accounts – would be barely felt if savers’ rates continued to fall now.
