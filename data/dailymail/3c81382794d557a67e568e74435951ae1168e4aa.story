A woman in Florida was arrested on Monday after she assaulted and stole jewelry from her 84-year-old grandmother, according to police.

Brigitte Matzke, 25, of Port Orange, wanted to spend the night in a hotel with her husband, 26-year-old Alex Caldwell, but didn't have the money and so visited the aging relative at her luxury apartment block.

Police say the couple demanded $80 from the woman, but when she said she didn't have it, her granddaughter physically attacked her.
