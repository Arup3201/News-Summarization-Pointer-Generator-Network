Badgers might be known for being a menace in gardens by digging up lawns, but the creatures have proved they can be useful by helping German archaeologists uncover the graves of Medieval warriors.

At least eight graves were found at a site in north Germany, including a skeleton still clutching a sword and 'wearing' an intricate belt buckle in the shape of a serpent.

An artist saw the badgers digging up bones and called experts to find out what the creatures had uncovered.

This nobleman was buried with a bronze belt buckle of a snakes head, a double edge sword and bowl by his feet ( all pictured). Archaeologists said he was a well-equipped warrior. Scars and bone-breaks show that he had been hit by lances and swords, and had also fallen from a horse

Artist Lars Wilhelm realised the badgers were digging into a grave, when he was watching them near his home in Brandenburg, according to a German news website.

He has been studying the badger set for around five years and told The Local: 'My wife and I are both sculptors. [We] wanted to put artworks in there'.

However, their plans have been scuppered by the discovery of the bones.

Mr Wilhelm called experts as soon as he realised the animals might have broken into a grave, the Berliner Zeitung newspaper reported.

Archaeologists expanded on the badgers' helpful excavation work to uncover eight graves, including two skeletons that appear to noblemen.

Professor Felix Biermann from the Ernst-August University in GÃ¶ttingen, who lead the dig, believes the badgers found late Slavish graves that date from the 12th Century.

He said the Uckermark Stolpe area was home to Christians at the time, as well as the rulers thought to be buried in the graves, which he believes held independent heathen beliefs.

One of the skeletons is thought to have been 40 at the time of death and was buried with a double-edged sword and bronze bowl at his feet.

Professor Biermann said: 'At the time such bowls were used to wet the hands before eating. The bowls would a sign that a man belonged to the upper classes.'

The same warrior was buried with a bronze belt buckle of a snakes head, which the archaeologists believe originally came from Scandinavia.

The professor said: 'He was a well-equipped warrior. Scars 
and bone-breaks show that he had been hit by lances and swords, and had 
also fallen from a horse.'
