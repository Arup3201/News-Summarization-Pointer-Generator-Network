Missing: Wayne Davies, 22, went missing after leaving the Hifi nightclub in Leiden, in the west of the Netherlands, in the early hours of Saturday morning

Dutch police believe that a missing British tourist might have fallen into a canal and drowned after he disappeared following a night out with friends.

Wayne Davies, 22, went missing after leaving the Hifi nightclub in Leiden, in the west of the Netherlands, in the early hours of Saturday morning. His mother raised the alarm the next day as he was due to return to Britain on Monday.

His bank card has not been used since his disappearance, according to police.

Detectives believe that Davies, who lives in East Grinstead, Sussex, where he works as an apprentice plumber, could have tripped into the city's extensive network of canals and waterways.

Police divers and sniffer dogs have been used to try and locate him, according to local media reports.

Davies had been staying in Leiden's Golden Tulip hotel with two friends. He is said to have been wearing black trousers, a blue hooded top and blue trainers in the hours before he went missing.

A spokesman for Sussex Police said: 'We were contacted on Sunday by the family of Wayne Davies from East Grinstead to say that he had gone missing while on holiday with friends.

'Wayne, 22, was last seen by his friends on 18 April in a nightclub in the city when they were leaving to go back to their hotel.

'He did not have his passport with him and his bank account has not been used.'

Missing persons officer Sergeant Andy Standing said: 'Wayne's mother reported him missing on Sunday. He was due to return the next day with his friends but did not.

'The Dutch police are investigating his disappearance and we are offering Mrs Davies support as and where we can.

'If anyone knows anything about where Wayne is I would urge them to contact us so we can find him.'
