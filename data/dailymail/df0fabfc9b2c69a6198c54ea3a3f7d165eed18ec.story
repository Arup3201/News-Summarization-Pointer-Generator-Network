Hospitals across Texas are being called in to help with more than 170 patients injured in the West fertilizer plant explosion as local hospitals struggle to treat injuries from horrific burns, shrapnel lacerations, broken bones to serious head wounds.

As rescuers try to find more survivors in the dozens of buildings flattened across the small farming community, doctors are in a race against time to help those injured.

Waco's Hillcrest Baptist Medical Center has taken in 165 patients since the blaze just before 8pm last night.

At least 38 people are in serious condition.

165 patients are being treated at Hillcrest Baptist Medical Center in Waco, with six in a critical condition including two children.

More than 60 people are being treated at Providence Healthcare Network in Waco, with at least one in a critical condition.

Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas
 confirmed is treating two people

John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth also has one case while Scott & White Memorial Hospital 
in Temple, a Level-1 Trauma Center, said it received three patients

Two children were also taken to McLane Children's Hospital,
Temple

Six patients are said to be critical with five in intensive care, two of which are children.

Up to 15 fatalities are already believed to have occurred in the blaze with authorities fearing those numbers will rise today.

'The injuries that we are seeing are very serious,' Glenn 
Robinson, CEO of Hillcrest Baptist Medical Center, told the Waco Tribune.

'There are a number 
of patients that will be going to surgery. ... It's a very, very 
unfortunate situation.'

Estimates say so far around 179 people have been found who were injured in the blast with 38 people in a serious condition.

Many victims have spoken of knowing those who have died - something which is inevitable in such a small community of 2,800.

Michael Maler, whose house was destroyed, told the Tribune: 'West is never going to be the same.'

Patients from the blast were also being taken to Providence
 Healthcare Network in Waco, a burn center at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas, and Scott 
& White Memorial in Temple, Texas.

John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth also has one case and two were also children taken to McLane Children's Hospital, 
Temple.

They were dealing with 
typical 'blast injuries' including punctured lungs, bowels, eardrums and 
possibly wounds caused by flying shrapnel and debris.

There were also broken 
bones and head injuries from those crushed under their homes flattened 
in the power of the blast which registered at 2.1 on the Richter scale.

Some patients, officials said, needed fertilizer decontamination, including irrigation of the eyes. 

Many medics rushed to help those injured when they saw the explosion last night.

Nurse Jill Jenkins told Today: 'It
 actually looked like 9-11, what you saw on TV with 9-11. There were 
people laying in their yards that had been blown out of their homes.'

'People were coming out bloody and injured,' she said, adding that many were suffering head injuries.

Emergency: Injured people had to be treated on the flood-lit the high school football field turned into a staging area after the blast

Burns: Victims were wheeled into the Hillcrest Baptist Medical Hospital, including children, and some were taken to a burns unit because of their extensive injuries

Many, including firefighters who were
 trying to put out the fire, are likely to have suffered extensive burns
 in the blast, which ripped through the town.

Mr Robinson added to CNN: [It is] 'everything from orthopedic injuries to patients that are experiencing serious blood loss.'

One boy had his ribs broken after he was flung four feet into the air by the force of the explosion.

Julie Zahirniako said she and her 
son, Anthony, had been playing at a school playground near the 
fertilizer plant when the explosion hit. 

The explosion threw her son four feet 
(over a meter) in the air, breaking his ribs. She said she saw people 
running from the nursing home and the roof of the school lifted into the
 air.

'The fire was so high," she said. 'It was just as loud as it could be. The ground and everything was shaking.'

Race against time: Emergency services staff raced across the football pitch to help the injured and taken them to hospital

Injured: There are around 38 people believed to be in a critical condition and nearly 200 have been treated in hospital or at the staging center

Admissions: Hospitals across Texas have been admitting patients, while volunteers gathered at a football stadium to deal with those hurt in the blast

Support: A school bus helped to evacuate the injured and local residents from West, Texas, to nearby hospitals
