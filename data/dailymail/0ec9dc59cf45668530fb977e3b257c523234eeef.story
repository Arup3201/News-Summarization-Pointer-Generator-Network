Privacy issues: Google's Eric Schmidt has splashed out $15m on a Manhattan penthouse that he has had soundproofed and which won't have a doorman

Billionaire Google boss Eric Schmidt is fiercely protective over his colorful and complex private life which includes a string of affairs.

In the past few years and despite his 
marriage to wife Wendy, Schmidt has had relationships with a series of younger
 women, including a vivacious television host who dubbed him ‘Dr 
Strangelove,' a leggy blonde public relations executive and a sexy 
Vietnamese concert pianist.

Now details have emerged that 58-year-old Schmidt has splashed out $15 million on a sprawling Manhattan penthouse in the trendy Flatiron District to be close to at least two of his female friends.

Schmidt has been seeing at least two New York-based women in Lisa Shields, an executive on the Council on 
Foreign Relations, and Vietnamese pianist Chau-Giang Thi Nguyen.

The glamorous love-nest was featured in Oliver Stone’s ‘Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps’ movie as the crash pad for Shia LaBeouf’s character.

So fiercely protective is Schmidt of his own - and his guests privacy - that he has insisted he doesn't want a doorman.

‘While
 everyone in New York wants a doorman, Eric specifically said he didn’t 
want one. He doesn’t want anyone to see him and his guests coming in and
 out. He insisted on his own elevator,’ a source familiar with the 
purchase told the New York Post.

With money no object to the
 billionaire, he has also invested in getting the 6,250-square-foot 
duplex - which has four bedrooms and a large entertainment area with a 
wet bar opening onto a 3,300-square-foot terrace - soundproofed to ensure complete 
privacy.

Meanwhile his wife Wendy, 57, remains at one of the couple’s many homes, a $23million waterfront mansion on Nantucket Island, Massachusetts, where she focuses on her philanthropic work amid reports that she has accepted their ‘open marriage’.

Schmidt, worth an estimated $8.2billion, is believed to have had at least one mistress sign a confidentiality agreement not to divulge any details of their relationship.

Stunning TV personality Kate Bohner, aged 46, had a three-year affair with the married mogul from 2007 to 2010. 

‘As far as Kate was concerned it was true love,’ her close friend Jason Parsley, a journalist, told the MailOnline. ‘She adored Eric. This wasn’t some short-term fling. This was a serious love affair that went on for three years.

His wife Wendy Schmidt stays at home and concentrates on her philanthropy work. She is said to have accepted the unusual martial situation

'The reason I am speaking out now is 
that it is ironic that someone like him can be so free and easy 
discussing other people’s privacy issues online while using his vast 
wealth to protect his own image.’

Bohner
 moved to Los Angeles to be near Schmidt, whose property empire includes
 a home near Google’s Silicon Valley HQ, and a $38 million estate in 
Montecito, California.

Bohner
 laid bare her feelings for Schmidt, whom she jokingly called ‘Dr 
Strangelove,’ in an online blog: Recoverygirl007. She revealed he had 
given her a prototype iPhone (late Apple boss Steve Jobs was a friend of
 Schmidt’s), whisked her away for romantic getaways and lavished her 
with expensive jewelery.

She wrote of her pain at their breakup, saying: ‘I’ve been sleeping with my Blackberry just in case Dr Strangelove might send an email.’

At the time of the affair, Schmidt was at the height of his power. He was brought in as Google’s CEO in 2001 by creators Sergey Brin and Larry Page, who relied on his expertise to turn their modest internet search engine into a global media powerhouse.

But Google has been criticized for not doing more to protect users, particularly children, against the  proliferation of porn on the web.

Google, which says it has a ‘zero-tolerance’ policy on child sexual abuse content, has argued policing the billions of images, stories and data generated daily on the internet would be a Herculean task and any controls could inadvertently restrict legitimate online searches. It says parents can use Google ‘filters’ like SafeSearch to prevent children accessing pornography.

‘What I worry about is that such laws are often slippery slopes,’ Eric Schmidt told a conference in May 2012. ‘In many other countries, adult pornography legislation is an attempt to legislate something else.’

But a source who knows Schmidt well 
defended him, saying: ‘Eric is integral to the success of Google and in 
enabling it to become a hugely successful company that employs 35,000 
people around the world and is a service that is much-loved by its 
users. He was a great CEO and very well regarded as someone with 
extraordinary technical knowledge and great business acumen.’

Bohner
 did not return calls or emails this week, possibly bound by her 
believed confidentiality agreement, but her close friend Parsley 
insisted: ‘It was a serious romance, at least as far as she was 
concerned. 

‘To my 
knowledge he would pay for her to travel to see him. He was always 
promising her he would get divorced. She cried on my shoulder countless 
times. She believed wholeheartedly he was going to leave his wife for 
her.’

Schmidt and 
Bohner were photographed together at the Burning Man festival in 2007, a
 gathering in the Nevada desert which showcases art and encourages 
creative thinking. 

The 
couple wore goggles and bandanas to protect themselves from sandstorms. 
Schmidt posed with his arm around his mistress, although he refused to 
join the masses camping in the desert, preferring a five-hour round trip
 to the nearest hotel.

Parsley
 continued: ‘They communicated a lot by phone and email when they were 
not together. But it devastated Kate that he would chose to spend 
holidays with his family. It was always the same, Thanksgiving, 
Christmas, all the big ones.

‘I am speaking out because Kate has 
been the victim of unfair comments online. In any affair, the woman 
always gets the blame – “Oh, she knew he was married.” 

‘Well,
 in this case it’s not so cut and dried. Yes, Eric was and is married. 
But he needs to look at himself long and hard and start living a 
truthful life. Eric wants to have his cake and eat it too. He has had 
numerous affairs and everybody knows it.’

Like Bohner, Schmidt’s other reported girlfriends have been glamorous, successful women of a certain age.

There
 was Marcy Simon, a leggy blonde PR executive in her mid-40s who was 
spotted with him on holiday on the French Riviera in 2006 and, according
 to reports, remains close to him still. He gave her a large, 
canary-yellow diamond ring.

Website Gawker.com reported on their split in December 2007, and also alleged that the couple rekindled their relationship in 2009,  when they were reportedly spotted together at the Aspen Ideas Conference in Colorado and in California.

Schmidt was also linked to Lisa Shields a 47-year-old divorced single mother who worked as a producer for America’s top-rated breakfast show Good Morning America.

According to the New York Post, in 2011 Schmidt took her on holidays aboard his $72.3million superyacht Oasis to the Caribbean and the South of France.

They were spotted dining out in the millionaire’s playground of Southampton in upstate New York, and according to the New York Post were ‘also spending time at a summer rental in the Hamptons’.

A source told the Post at the time: ‘She has been telling friends they are dating and they have been going out openly in New York and the Hamptons as a couple.’

Shields now works as a publicist for the Council On Foreign Relations in New York, and speaking from her weekend home in the Hamptons did not deny her reported relationship with Eric Schmidt, but added: ‘I never comment on my personal life.’

Eric Schmidt has been criticised because of his 'free and easy' approach to others' privacy while using his vast wealth to protect his own

Schmidt’s most recent affair, according to the New York Post (which has taken particular delight in his extramarital interests) was with sultry Vietnamese concert pianist Chau-Giang Nguyen, with whom he has been spotted dining at upscale New York restaurants.

A source said: ‘He has been very supportive of her music career. Eric is getting increasingly interested in the arts.’ 

Nguyen, who declined to comment on their relationship, was previously engaged to Hollywood producer Brian Grazer. Wendy Schmidt failed to respond to requests from the MailOnline for comment about her marriage. She met her husband at Berkeley University in the late 1970s and they married in 1980. 

They have two grown-up daughters, Sophie and Alison, who remain close to their father.

In her only comments on the  subject, Wendy told the New York Times: ‘Some couples are very much in each others’ space. In our case, we are both busy. I think it’s nonsense and, between us, if we know what is going on in our lives and we are happy, that kind of stuff is part of his being in the public eye.’

She added she would tire of ‘following’ her husband around the globe: ‘I would feel like a piece of luggage, and he wouldn’t want me  to feel that way.’

When asked about his open marriage Mr Schmidt told The New York Times : ‘I don’t think that is an appropriate question. We don’t comment on that, rumors.’

Schmidt hit back at critics of Google who argue the company should be more concerned about protecting people’s privacy, saying: ‘If you have something that you don’t want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn’t be doing it in the first place.’

It is, perhaps, advice he would be wise to heed himself.
