A sad love story for one man may end up brightening some people's days this holiday season in South Dakota.

The man dropped a 14-karat gold, half-carat diamond engagement ring along with a note in a Salvation Army kettle outside a sporting goods store in Mitchell. 

The ring and note were taped to a $10 bill.

The note partially reads: 'This ring made me the happiest man in the world when she said yes, and the saddest when she returned it.'

A Salvation Army store in South Dakota received an expensive, albeit heartbreaking, kettle donation this week

The man added that he hopes the ring can be used 'to make some kids happy'.

Salvation Army office manager Sheena Loudner says the ring has been valued at $1,200. 

She says the group is going to try to get some bids on the ring and sell it.

Mitchell Major Vickie Cole agreed. 

'My heart goes out to that man who gave it,' Mayor Cole told Keloland TV.

'His heart was broken and a time that could've been a very joyful time, but then he gave from his heart and said this could help children.'

'Young people, students, families that want to get together and share with their children what this money will help and it's their way of showing how one hour or two hours will bring a change in someone's life.'

Donations: The ring was collected by these Red Kettle volunteers in Mitchell, South Dakota

Surprise: The anonymous donor had wrapped the ring in a $10 bill, so the collectors were unaware of who placed it in the bucket

Major Cole is hoping to have $35,000 from the kettles by the end of the campaign.

However the ringers have only raised about $9,000 and there are only two weeks left.

As it stands the highest bid for the engagement ring is $750. 

Meanwhile, last week an anonymous benefactor placed a separate diamond ring - valued at $1,850 - and her wedding band in one of the kettles placed outside Boston's North Station.

The rings were accompanied by a note in which the woman said she hoped they would be sold and the money used to buy toys for needy children. 

She said her husband always had a giving spirit - especially at Christmas time.

'To honor his memory, I donate this ring,' the note said.

Big donation: This diamond ring, valued at $1,850, and a wedding band were placed in a red donation kettle outside Boston's North Station last week

The Salvation Army said the rings, given by an anonymous widow in honor of her late husband, were accompanied by a note in which the woman said she hoped the money would buy toys for needy children

'I'm hoping there's someone out there who made lots of money this year and will buy the ring for 10 times its worth. 

'After all, there's no price on love or the sentimental value of this ring. 

But money will help the kids. 

'May everyone have a Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays and Happy New Year!'

Salvation Army Major David Davis said Monday the 'incredible' donation warmed the hearts of bell-ringers and other volunteers.

'We're so moved and incredibly grateful to the generous individual who made such a loving and kind donation,' Davis said. 

'This heartwarming gift boosts all of our staff, bell-ringers and volunteers.'
