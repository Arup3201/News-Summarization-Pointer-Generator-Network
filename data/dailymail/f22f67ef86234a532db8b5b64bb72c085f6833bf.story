They are usually portrayed as mortal enemies on screen.

But this cat cannot hold a grudge against dogs - after he received a blood transfusion from one.

Buttercup the tabby was in desperate need of a transfusion after collapsing at his home in Key West in Monroe County, Florida, last month.

Rare procedure: Buttercup the tabby is pictured receiving a blood transfusion from a dog after collapsing at his home in Key West in Monroe County, Florida, last month. Incredibly, he has since made a full recovery

He was rushed to Marathon Veterinary Hospital (MVH), where he was diagnosed with anemia, with a red blood cell count of just seven per cent, far lower than the minimum of 35 for a healthy feline.

But despite his life-threatening condition, vets told his owner Ernie Saunders it would take too long to find him an exact feline blood donor.

Instead, they decided to perform an extremely rare procedure - called a xenotransfusion - using blood from a West Palm Beach dog blood bank.

Dr Sean Perry, who performed the operation on Buttercup at MVH, told the Miami Herald: 'Cat's blood is a little harder to come by and not as available as dog's blood.

"You can't give type A blood to a type B blood cat because it'll cause a severe immune reaction. It was actually safer to give the cat dog's blood. It is a very rare procedure.'

He added: 'We had greyhound blood packs that we get from a blood bank that has red blood cells separated from plasma. Buttercup showed no signs of rejection during the transfusion.'

The four-hour procedure has been carried out on just 62 cats in the U.S, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine.

Mr Saunders, who also discovered Buttercup was actually a male - not a female, as he had previously thought - during the surgery, said his pet has since made a full recovery.
