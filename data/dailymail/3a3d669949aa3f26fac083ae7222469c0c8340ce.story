Brave: Lance Corporal James Collins, from Dundee, stood on a live grenade to save his comrades - then went on to play professional football for 15 years

A First World War soldier stood on a live grenade to save his comrades - and then went on to play professional football for 15 years.

Lance Corporal James Collins, from Dundee, was advised to have his right foot and lower leg amputated after being seriously injured in the blast on the Western Front.

But the soldier refused to allow medics to remove his limb - and instead, underwent 14 operations over the next two years.

Astonishingly, he then went on to play for Swansea City FC for 15 years - and even rose to the level of captain.

Now, his rare Albert Medal - awarded to him for his heroic actions - has sold at auction for nearly £22,000.

Before the war, L/Cpl Collins was a promising footballer who played for his local Dundee team, St Joseph’s FC.

He subsequently enlisted in the Royal Army Medical Corps and 
served with the 14th Field Ambulance at the advanced dressing station at
 La Bergere, near Monshyn-le-Roux, France.

By standing on the live grenade on November 11, 1917, he saved the lives of two colleagues, who managed to escape the explosion unscathed.

According to a citation published in the London Gazette, L/Cpl had been escorting a ‘lunatic’ soldier through the trenches when the captive escaped.

It
 states: 'Collins ran after him, and when he got near him the man 
threatened to throw a bomb at him. Collins closed with the man, who then
 withdrew the pin from the bomb and let it fall in the trench.

'In
 an endeavour to save the patient and two other soldiers who were near, 
Collins put his foot upon the bomb, which exploded, killing the lunatic 
and injuring Collins severely.

'Fortunately the two soldiers were not hurt. Collins, who could easily have got out of the way, ran the gravest risk of losing his life in order to save others.'

L/Cpl Collins suffered severe injuries in the blast - with his foot and lower right leg riddled with shrapnel.

But despite his injuries, he made his debut as a defender for Swansea City FC in 1920, before leading the Welsh team to an FA Cup semi-final and the old Third Division Championship.

Award: The soldier was later awarded the Albert Medal by King George V at Buckingham Palace for his heroic actions. Above,  L/Cpl Collins is pictured with his mother outside the Palace following the award ceremony

'For gallantry in saving life': The Albert Medal is a rare award which is the civilian version of the Victoria Cross

During his 15-year career, he also scored a hat-trick against Bristol Rovers in an 8-1 win.

L/Cpl Collins was later awarded the Albert Medal, a rare medal which was replaced by the George Medal and is the civilian version to the Victoria Cross.

King George V presented the soldier with the prestigious medal at Buckingham Palace.

After retiring from professional football, L/Cpl Collins became a football coach, before volunteering for service with the with the Royal Engineers during the Second World War.

Sale: L/Cpl Collins's medal has been sold at Spinks auction house (pictured) in London for nearly £22,000

He died in Dundee in 1963 aged 67.

The soldier's medal was bought by an unnamed collector at Spinks auction house in London for a hammer price of £18,000 - with added fees taking the total to £21,600.

Oliver Pepys, a medal expert at Spinks, said: 'It was a very selfless thing what he did and a splendid act of cold courage.

'Although
 the medical advice was to amputate his foot, he was clearly desperate 
to one day resume his footballing career and wasn’t going to let some 
doctor tell him otherwise.

'He was quite young when he went to the Western Front and still had many years ahead of him to play football.'
