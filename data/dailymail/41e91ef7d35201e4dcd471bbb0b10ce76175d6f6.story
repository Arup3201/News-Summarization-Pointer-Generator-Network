Police have launched an investigation after banknotes worth tens of thousands of pounds were mysteriously found floating down a river.

Detectives are liaising with the Bank of England after £60,000 worth of damaged notes were seen floating in the water by a stunned dog walker - but so far there are no clues to where it has come from.

The cash was spotted in South Drove Drain near Spalding town centre, Lincolnshire, on Friday 25 October.

Detectives are liaising with the Bank of England after £60,000 worth of notes were seen floating in water in Lincolnshire by a stunned dog walker

The money was retrieved from the river by officers, whose initial count estimated the cash to be in the region of sixty thousand pounds.

Lincolnshire Police are intending to consult with the Bank of England for assistance with a formal inspection of the money and a final accurate count.

Police said a large amount of the money has been damaged due to time it spent being the water but there is a good quantity of bank notes that appear to be in fair condition

A large amount of the money has been 
damaged due to time it spent being the water but there is a good 
quantity of bank notes that appear to be in fair condition.

If you discover money in the street, according to the law, you must either hand it in or report it to the police.

If you keep it but report it, and the owner reports the loss, you must hand it over.

If you choose to hand it in you will be given the form that entitles you to collect it after 28 days.

If you don't report it to the Police, you are guilty of 'theft by finding' and can be charged.

However, police cannot let finders keep unclaimed mobile phones or objects that may contain personal data, such as laptops or iPads.

Police
are considering detailed forensic examination of the money and have 
been granted a seizure order by the local Magistrates Court to carry out
an investigation into its origins.

DC Steve Hull, of Spalding CID, says, 
‘It isn’t everyday that an amount of money like this is found and 
somebody must have information that will help the police trace the 
lawful owner.

'I would be grateful to hear from people who have genuine information to pass on to me.'

The money will remain with the police until the investigation is complete. If the money can not be reunited with a legitimate owner then it will become the subject of a further court forfeiture order.

A spokesman for Lincolnshire Police said evidence of ownership of the money would  be required if the owner wishes to come forward.
