Around 24million people in Britain are working in the private sector, the highest number since records began, the Office for National Statistics said yesterday.

Over the past year, the number of private sector workers has jumped by 627,000 – while the number of public sector workers has dropped by 128,000.

The public sector is now the smallest it has been for a decade, employing 5.7million – while the private sector has hit 23.9million.

Not so busy: The number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance fell by 3,000 in November

This means the private sector is 
managing to create jobs nearly five times faster than the State 
workforce is being cut by the Government’s austerity drive.

The figures also show unemployment is 
falling at its fastest pace for more than a decade – defying gloomy 
predictions that it was set to sky-rocket due to the anaemic economic 
recovery.

Overall, unemployment fell by 82,000 
between August and October to 2.51million, the biggest drop since the 
recession began and the largest fall since 2001.

The total number of workers across the
public and private sector, including many who are self-employed, has 
hit 29.6million, the largest workforce since records began in 1971.

North East 9.5% - 123,000 unemployed (-11,000 compared to last quarter)

North West 8.6% - 298,000 (-18,000)

Yorkshire/Humber 8.8% - 243,000 (-29,000)

East Midlands 8.0% - 184,000 (-8,000)

West Midlands 8.7% - 236,000 (-1,000)

East 6.9% - 216,000 (+15,000)

London 9.0% - 382,000 (+5,000)

South East 6.3% - 283,000 (-)

South West 5.7% - 155,000 (+2,000)

Wales 7.9% - 117,000 (-15,000)

Scotland 7.6% - 204,000 (-19,000)

Northern Ireland 7.8% 68,000 (-3,000)

One economist yesterday said the 
figures represent a ‘phenomenal achievement’, given the country’s weak 
economic performance amid fears of a triple-dip recession.

The figures exclude the effect of the 
‘reclassification’ of 196,000 workers in English sixth forms and further
education colleges from the public into the private sector earlier this
year.

Andrew Goodwin, senior economic 
adviser to the accountant Ernst & Young’s Item Club, said: ‘These 
are phenomenal achievements given the economy has flat-lined over the 
last year.’

Employment Minister Mark Hoban said: 
‘Once again, these figures show that the private sector is creating far 
more jobs than are being lost in the public sector.

'It is a credit to 
British businesses that they’re proving wrong those cynics who claimed 
the private sector wouldn’t be able to step up.’

Such a large workforce is helped by 
the growth in population. The latest Census showed the population of 
England and Wales is 56.1million, up 3.7million in just 10 years.

The employment rate of those between 
the ages of 16 and 64, which is the number of workers as a percentage of
the total population in this age group, is below its record. It is 
currently 71.2 per cent, compared to a peak of 73.1 per cent.

Fall: Unemployment is down by half a percentage point compared to a year ago, at 7.8 per cent

And worrying signs remain in the 
monthly jobs figures, particularly the number of those who have been 
unemployed for a long time.

While unemployment is falling, this 
includes many who have been out of work for only a few weeks or months 
while long-term unemployment remains worryingly high.

The Prime Minister said long-term unemployment remains ‘stubbornly high’, adding: ‘It is still a problem.’

Of the 2.51million unemployed, 904,000 – more than a third – have been out of work for more than 12 months.

Neil Carberry, director for employment at the CBI business lobby group, said this long-term unemployment is ‘deeply troubling’.

Out of work: More than half of those unemployed have been jobless for more than six months, with nearly a million people hunting for work for over a year
