It's the stuff little girls whose walls are adorned with pictures of Disney Princesses dream of. Now when they grow up they can become a little mermaid like Ariel thanks to a school in the Philippines. 

The Phillipine Mermaid Swimming Academy in Manila are offering lessons in how to swim like the mythical creature by donning a tail and learning under water breathing techniques.

Starting at £25 a class, the two-hour 'mermaid snorkelling' lessons are taught by qualified diving instructors.

Mermaid make-over: A school in the Philippines is offering lessons in how to become the mythical creature

Mermaid tricks such as dolphin kicks, hand stands and bubble rings are taught in classes as well as swimming

For £50, aspiring mermaids can indulge in two hours of 'Mermaid scuba diving'.

Mermaid tricks such as dolphin kicks, hand stands and blowing a kiss under water are also taught in the classes, as well as how to possess the grace and elegance of a mermaid. They also try an instil an appreciation for the marine environment.

For those reluctant to dive in, they can just have a mermaid makeover and photo shoot.

The school has been a hit so far - and not just with children. They said people of all ages have been coming to learn what it's like to be part human, part fish.

Arabella Jimenez, one of the mermaid academy instructor says in a video you can view below: 'We have this notion that mermaids are beautiful, playful, fun, adventurous and graceful so this is what we want to impart to the children.'

One woman who has taken part in the lessons explained: 'For me, the mermaid spirit is 
the ability to care because once you are a mermaid you also get to be 
aware of your surroundings and your environment, especially the marine 
environment.'

Another of the made-over mermaids giggles, 'every girl wants to be a mermaid at one point in her life,' as she splashes her tail.

Mermaids have been popular features 
in art and literature for centuries and the idea of them can be traced 
back to Greek mythology.

Hans
Christian Andersen bought the creature to life with his fairytale, The 
Little Mermaid, who dreams of becoming human so she can marry a prince. 
The story was then given the Disney treatment in 1989.

Their
version of the Little Mermaid, Ariel, remains a children's favourite 
more than two decades on from the film's first release as part of the 
Disney Princess merchandising machine.

So anyone with a little girl under the age of six may have to start saving up for a trip to the Philippines some time soon.
