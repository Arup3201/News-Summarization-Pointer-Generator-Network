Mitt Romney has condemned Barack Obama's 'angry and desperate Presidency' after Vice President Joe Biden told a largely African-American crowd that the Republicans were 'going to put y'all back in chains'.

Vice President Biden made the race blunder while declaring Republicans wanted to 'unchain Wall Street'.

But his comment sparked a furious reaction from Romney, who accused the Obama campaign of race-baiting and promoting politics of hate.

Tough talk: Mitt Romney had some unusually strong words for President Obama and his surrogates during a speech in Ohio on Tuesday after Vice President Biden made a race gaffe

Joe Biden drew the ire of the Mitt Romney camp after telling an audience that the Republican would put voters 'back in chains' with his Wall Street financial deregulation plans

Support: Hundreds of coal miners and their families wait to attend Romney's rally

'Mr. President, take your campaign of 
division and anger and hate back to Chicago,' Romney said at an Ohio 
event, where hundreds of coal miners and their families had earlier stood in line to attend.

'His campaign and his surrogates have
 made wild and reckless accusations that disgrace the office of the 
Presidency.  Another outrageous charge came a few hours ago in Virginia.
 And the White House sinks a little bit lower.

'His campaign has resorted to 
diversions and distractions, to demagoguing and defaming others. This is
 an old game in politics; what’s different this year is that the 
president is taking things to a new low.'

Biden
 later clarified his comment, insisting he was merely using the same 
phrases the Republicans had used - but admitting he said 'unchained' 
instead of 'unshackled'. His full statement is shown below.

The Romney campaign got an energy 
boost over the weekend when he announced his selection of Wisconsin 
Congressman Paul Ryan as his running mate.

statements while in Danville. More than 50 percent of the Virginian 
town's population is African American

'Attack dog'? Paul Ryan was selected as Romney's vice presidential nominee, a role that is typically thought of as the more aggressive of the two

Though the vice president is largely seen as the 'attack dog' in presidential campaigns, in a supposed effort to keep the top-of-the-ticket from appearing too negative, Tuesday night's speech by Romney shows that he is not afraid to throw some punches.

The Obama campaign responded in kind, saying that it was not Biden or the president who were disrespecting the Office but Romney with his plethora of negative ads.

'Governor Romney's comments tonight seemed unhinged, and particularly strange coming at a time when he's pouring tens of millions of dollars into negative ads that are demonstrably false,' Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt said in response to Romney's speech.

Critiques of negative ads have gone both ways, however, as a PAC that supports Obama was widely panned after it released an ad where a retired steel worker blamed Romney's venture capital firm for firing him, prompting him to lose his health insurance, which the man then said caused his wife to die of cancer.

'Whether its accusing Mitt Romney of being a felon, having been responsible for a woman’s tragic death or now wanting to put people in chains, there’s no question that because of the president’s failed record he’s been reduced to a desperate campaign based on division and demonization,' Romney campaign spokesman Andrea Saul said, referencing the Priorities USA Action advertisement.

The latest Real Clear Politics composite poll has Obama coming in at 47.6 per cent, leading by 3.7 to Romney’s 43.9 per cent.

'We don't have to imagine any more. The details are there. Here’s what Congressman Ryan said. He said, "We believe a renewed commitment to limited government will unshackle our economy."

'The Speaker of the House said, used the word "unshackled" as well, referring to their proposals. The last time these guys unshackled the economy, to use their term, they put the middle class in shackles. That’s how we got where we are.'Nine million jobs lost. Wage stagnation. Sixteen trillion dollars in wealth you all lost in your home equity, in your 401Ks and your pension plans. You’re the ones that got nailed. All of America, except the very few.'And I’m told that when I made that comment earlier today in Danville, Virginia, the Romney campaign put out a tweet. You know, tweets these days? Put out a tweet, went on the airwaves saying, "Biden, he’s outrageous in saying that." I think I said instead of "unshackled", "unchained".

'Outrageous to say that. That’s what we had. I’m using their own words. I got a message for them. If you want to know what's outrageous, it's their policies and the effects of their policies on middle class America. That’s what’s outrageous.'
