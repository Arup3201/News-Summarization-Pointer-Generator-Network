How would Louis van Gaal defend this humiliating result?

All eyes and ears were fixed on the Dutchman as he strode into the John Ruddy Suite at the Abbey Stadium for his post-match press conference.

The room certainly isn't what Van Gaal is used to. Small, tight - and adjacent to a gym weights room.

CLICK HERE to read Matt Barlow's report from the Abbey Stadium as Manchester United and Cambridge United drew 0-0 in their FA Cup clash.

He's certainly spoken in plusher surroundings.

But that summed up United's night. They aren't used to results like this.

So why were a side that included Radamel Falcao and Angel Di Maria unable to break down a side playing three levels below them in the English football spectrum?

Van Gaal provided a bullish response: 'Every aspect of this match was against us.

'What do I mean? We have to come here, the pitch isn't so good - that can influence the style you play.

'The opponents always give a lot more than they normally give and defending is always easier than attacking.

'We knew in advance everything would be against us - but you have to survive.

'And then you have seen the referee - its always the same. Everywhere I have coached these games, and I have coached them with other clubs, it's always the same.

'What was wrong with the referee? You can give your own opinion, I can't give mine.'

That could well be because there was nothing wrong with referee Chris Foy's performance.

Van Gaal's comments were, of course, a deliberate ploy to deflect attention away from his side's inept display.

Had he heard some of the views of United supporters leaving the Abbey Stadium following the final whistle, then Van Gaal may have been harsher on his charges.

The Dutchman didn't let his players off the hook completely, though.

'We made the same mistakes as we did against Yeovil and Queens Park Rangers in that we played in the same style as the opponent and that was our error.

'In the second half we played much better, we played along the floor.

'So it's a pity, again, that we had to wait till half time, but in the second half I was pleased, we didn't score but I have to give credit to Cambridge.

'They played very well and were well organised, with heart, and they fought until the end.

'We could have scored but now we have an extra match, we are still in the cup and that's the most important thing.

'I have seen a lot of times that big clubs lose against such opponents.'

And then came the perennial questions about his choice of formation.

He knew it was coming too, as a wry smile came across Van Gaal's face.

United reverted to a flat back four after starting last weekend's win over QPR with three-at-the back.

Van Gaal said: 'Do you watch our games? Against Yeovil, we played the other system and in the second half we played 4-4-2,' said the United boss.

'So when it’s not going well I change, and we won 2-0. Queens Park Rangers was the same, we played the other system and changed to 4-4-2 (and won).

'We created more chances and so you are more convinced. I know the statistics of the other performances and you can see we created more chances.

'But it’s not only the system, it’s the performance of the system.'

There was a much more enthusiastic mood during Van Gaal's counterpart, Richard Money's, press conference.

Money is, perhaps, an appropriate name for last night. His side's heroics could earn Cambridge upwards of £1.7million from their replay at Old Trafford the week after next.

'It's going to be a massive amount of money, I can't think about to be honest,' said Money.

'I'm sure the chairman wouldn't have been happy if we scored. I've just said in the dressing room we are going to Old Trafford, so who cares what happens.

'Enjoy soak it in, 75,000 people, whatever happens happens. It’s hard to put into words how proud we are.

'This club has been in the doldrums with 10 years out of the Football League, and now we’re taking everybody back to Old Trafford.

'In the second half we showed great character and courage, but in the first half we were good and carried a threat.

'We had a couple of good set pieces and couldn’t quite produce the final touch.

'I must put in a special word for the goalkeeper and two centre halves, who were terrific.

'We spent a lot of time before kick-off making them aware who the players were, giving them a good look at the Man United badge.

'I told them to stick their chests out, and go out and play - not to be fazed.'
