Australian grandmother Deborah Scheithe liked what she saw when her daughter showed off her newly augmented breasts.

In fact, the 50-year-old was so impressed that this recently inspired her to go under the knife for breast implants.

But Ms Scheithe isn't alone as she's part of a burgeoning market of older women seeking boob jobs in Australia.

NSW resident Deborah Schiethe had a boob job at age 50, (pictured to the left before, and right after) and is part of a growing trend of older women going under the knife

The grandmother, from Tumut in NSW, told news.com.au the reason she had the surgery was because she'd 'lost a lot of fullness and wanted some of my womanhood back'.

'My daughter had surgery done the year before and I was so impressed I had mine done,' she said.

To keep up with the demand, cosmetic surgeons are trying to combat competitive packages offered in Asian countries by lowering the cost of carrying out the procedure.

Some women over the age of 50 - even into their 70s - are claiming it is now cheaper to undergo breast augmentation surgery than they expected and more accessible.

Ms Scheithe said she was surprised at the decreased cost, as The Cosmetic Institute in Parramatta, Sydney, charged her $5,990 for the operation.

The institute said despite their usual clientele being women in their early 20s or women between the ages of 30 to 45 going under the knife post-baby, the demand for the discounted procedure is increasing.

Recently they had a 70-year-old woman who underwent a boob job and a tummy tuck at their clinic after suddenly finding herself single.

The Cosmetic Institute is also set to open a clinic in Bondi due to demand.

In a similar vein, discounted boob jobs will be offered on the Gold Coast to compete against the increase in patients heading to Asia for cut-price surgery.

In an Australian first, a cosmetic tourism agency based in Queensland's Broadbeach is teaming up with respected plastic surgeons to offer cheaper procedures.

CosMediTour, along with Dr Craig Layt and Dr Luke Stradwick, are offering boob job holidays for about $7900.

For those who just want the procedure done, it's $6880 - including an anaesthetist and the hospital stay.

Through the new Gold Coast Breast Academy, the two doctors will train plastic surgeons for standard breast implants that can be offered at a cheaper price.

Breast implants with a plastic surgeon cost $10,000 on average in Australia compared to $4000 in Thailand.

Gold Coast girls Natalie Kernke, Anna Thomsen and Noi Aasen have all travelled to Thailand to get their boob jobs through CosMediTour

A Surfers Paradise or Broadbeach boob job holiday includes a nine-night stay, day surgery at Southport’s Pacific Private Hospital and a follow-up appointment six days after the surgery.

There is also an option to upgrade to have a nurse monitor patients on the first night.

And there is already interest coming from New Zealand and Perth, just days after the package went on offer.

‘There are people who don’t want to go to Thailand or are not comfortable to have surgery off-shore,' CosMediTour managing director Greg Lemon said.

'We don’t send anyone to plastic surgeons in Thailand...and we wanted to offer people the option of using plastic surgeons here.

'You can get cut price boob jobs in Australia, but not with plastic surgeons.'

In Australia, a plastic surgeon has to be accepted into the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons and study an extra five years to become qualified, where as a cosmetic doctor does not.

CosMediTour currently sends about 100 patients every month jet to Bangkok or Phuket, with 80 per cent of them having breast implants.

But there is a catch to getting discount breasts.

The cheaper price is for implants up to 400ml and patients have to meet certain criteria.

Mr Lemon said the procedure would be ideal for women with no sagging breasts or asymmetry because they would need different surgery.

Gold Coast resident Anna Thomsen, who had a boob job in Bangkok, welcomed the discounted procedure to Australian shores.

'I think it’s a great idea having it on the Gold Coast because some people would be terrified of the idea of going to Thailand so it makes it a bit more convenient,' she said.

According to Phuket International Hospital’s Peter Davison, there is a market for cheaper breast implants in Australia.

He said out of 2000 cosmetic surgery cases a year 1600 were Australians, with 30 per cent from Queensland and that trend is growing.

Mr Davison said the hospital was seeing a 30 per cent growth in numbers every year.
