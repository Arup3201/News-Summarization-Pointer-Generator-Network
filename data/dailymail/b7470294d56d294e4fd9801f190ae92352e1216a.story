Hurtling over peaks at 500 km an hour (310 miles an hour), a Swiss man flew over the Alps in a wing-suit yesterday.

His team said it was the first time the mountain range had been crossed in such a free fall.  

Parachutist Remo Laeng, 36, jumped from a plane 7,500 metres (24,600ft) up, near the Swiss ski resort of Verbier and sped south over the Alps.

Laeng flew for 4 minutes before 
crossing the 4,314 metre (14,153 feet) high Grand Combin peak in 
southwest Switzerland to mark the feat.                

Wing-suit
flying, first developed in the 1990s, uses a special jumpsuit with 
webbing between the limbs to add surface area to the body and give it 
lift to enable to wearer to glide towards the ground before deploying a 
parachute.     

Laeng 
triggered his parachute after a seven-minute ride, covering 26 km (16 
miles) horizontally, before landing safely in Aosta, Italy, Swiss news 
agency SDA reported.

One of his greatest challenges during
the flight was judging whether he had enough altitude to get over the 
Grand Combin.       

Laeng
jumped from above Verbier in temperatures approaching minus 60 degrees 
Fahrenheit, attaining air speeds of up to 310 miles per hour.

'My altimeter didn’t work,' he was quoted as saying by SDA. 'The sky was so clear I saw the ocean off of Genoa.'

He added: 'I don't run any risks. If I see that it is not enough I would break off the flight... I never had any doubts.'
