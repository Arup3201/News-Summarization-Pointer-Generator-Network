Lib Dem MP David Ward was summoned to meet party enforcers to explain comments about the Holocaust he posted on his 
website

A Lib Dem MP who sparked a row on the
 eve of a Holocaust memorial with comments about 'the Jews' is to escape
 censure while he receives training in how not to be offensive.

Campaigners
 accused Nick Clegg of not taking anti-Semitism seriously after it 
emerged that plans to punish Bradford East MP David Ward have been 
'adjourned' while he learns what language to use in future.

The
 row comes as the Lib Dems reputation has been battered by allegations 
of a cover-up over groping claims against Lord Rennard and the 
resignation of former Cabinet minister Chris Huhne, who faces jail for 
perverting the course of justice.

Embattled Lib Dem leader Mr Clegg staged a showdown meeting with Mr Ward over his 'unacceptable' comments in which he accused 'the Jews' of atrocities against Palestinians.

Days before the annual Holocaust Memorial Day last month, Mr Ward wrote on his blog: 'Having visited Auschwitz twice - once with my family 
and once with local schools - I am saddened that the Jews, who suffered 
unbelievable levels of persecution during the Holocaust, could within a 
few years of liberation from the death camps be inflicting atrocities on
Palestinians in the new State of Israel and continue to do so on a 
daily basis in the West Bank and Gaza.'

He
 was summoned to the meeting with Mr Clegg and Lib Dem chief whip 
Alistair Carmichael where he was told his use of the phrase was 
‘unacceptable and must not be repeated’.

During
 the hearing Mr Ward agreed to remove the comments from his website and 
said he would work with the Liberal Democrat Friends of Israel to ‘agree
 language’ that is proportionate, according to the party.

But the Holocaust Educational Trust said the Lib Dems' response to the ‘sickening’ comments was ‘disappointing’.

Mr Ward's comments came days before Holocaust Memorial Day whih marks the 68th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, where more than one million people, mostly Jews, were killed

The row first blew up over a posting made by Mr Ward after signing a memorial book to mark Holocaust Memorial Day last month.

Following the disciplinary meeting Mr Carmichael sent a letter to the MP setting out the party's actions.

He
 wrote: ‘At the meeting you undertook to work along with Liberal 
Democrat Friends of Israel and Simon Hughes MP to identify and agree 
language that will be proportionate and precise in your future 
interventions in this debate. We would also hope that this would allow 
you to achieve a better understanding of the legitimate concern that 
your comments has caused within the wider Jewish community.

‘I am not clear how much time this 
work will require although it will involve other people making time 
available to work with you and their availability is at present unknown.

'In the circumstances,
 therefore, the disciplinary process currently stands adjourned and a 
date will require to be fixed at which progress can be reviewed and it 
can be concluded.’

Mr 
Carmichael added that Mr Clegg wanted it to be understood that the 
‘party recognises your right to express your legitimately and sincerely 
held views’ on conditions in which Palestinians live, especially on the 
West Bank and in Gaza.

He 
added: ‘He was equally clear, however, that the language in which these 
views are articulated must not be generalised and indiscriminate in its 
nature. Liberal Democrats believe in fearless criticism where it is 
justified, but abhor generalised condemnation of a whole people where it
 is not.’

Karen Pollock, 
chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, said: ‘This is a 
disappointing response to Mr Ward's sickening and unacceptable comments 
which he has kept on his website.

‘He
 has shown no understanding of the offence he caused in both the 
language that he used and the timing of his comments - sadly the 
mishandling of this situation appears to demonstrate that Holocaust 
equivocation and anti-Semitism are not being taken seriously.’
