Break out the barbecue as Britain is basking in glorious sunshine with the good weather expected to continue over the whole weekend.

The mercury has already passed 22.4C afternoon with sunseekers flocking to the UK's parks and beaches to make the best of the good weather.

Three-year-old Sophie Walker kept herself sheltered from the afternoon sun as she took a stroll using a ladybird umbrella as a parasol in rapeseed fields in Earsdon, North Tyneside.

The saying 'red sky at night shepherd's delight' looks set to have proved correct as the climax to a fine day saw paddle boarders go for a late surf against the backdrop of a stunning crimson and orange sky in Croyde Bay in North Devon last night.

 And despite a wet start for that part of the country this morning, the south west is set to see the best of the weather this afternoon with most of the country enjoying a fine day.

The hottest temperature of the day so far was recorded in Plymouth this afternoon.

Forecasters recorded the temperature as reaching 22.4C in the Devon town.

Brighton beach was pictured slowly filling up this afternoon and the weather was even warm enough for Sian Wilson and Ella King to don bikinis.

Festival goers also enjoyed the sun at Heaton Park, Manchester,  for the Parklife Weekender.

Coastal areas in the east and parts of Scotland could see a fair bit of cloud however, and the mercury won't hit the same heights as yesterday - temperatures are expected to peak at 22C.

The west of the UK will enjoy the best conditions again tomorrow.

Met Office forecasters predict that a build up of clouds overnight from the east will disappear fairly early on, and while most of the country will once again bask in sunshine.

While parts of Scotland and Northern Ireland could see the odd shower, forecasters say that they will not be heavy and will only break up spells of sunshine.

Again temperatures will drop a little and could reach a maximum of 20C in parts of the south west.

It should also stay settled for Monday despite a weather system coming in from the west, with only far outlying western areas likely to see rain and temperatures likely to peak at about 19C.

On Tuesday, that band of rain is expected to move across the west of the UK while the east will stay fair and temperatures could increase slightly to 22C.

Forecasters predict unsettled weather for the rest of the week, but the outlook is not all bleak.

Met Office forecaster David Jackson said: 'With a band of rain coming in on Tuesday and Wednesday that signals the start of an unsettled period but there should still be plenty of sunny weather to be enjoyed.'
