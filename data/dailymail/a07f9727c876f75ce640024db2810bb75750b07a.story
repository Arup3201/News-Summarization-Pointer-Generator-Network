Since the first programme  was recorded in BBC’s  bomb-damaged Maida Vale studio 70 years ago, Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs has become an essential part of weekly life for millions of listeners.

Over the decades, 3,000 shows have been broadcast, with guests picking the music and treasures they would want for company  if they were cast away on that fictional island.

Author Mitchell Symons reveals some of the bizarre stories, facts and figures from those 70 years  . . . 

Decades of discs: With over 3,000 shows broadcast since 1942, Desert Island Discs has racked up an impressive stack of trivia

THE CASTAWAYS

Many guests have made multiple appearances since the show was first broadcast in January 1942. But two people hold the joint record with four broadcasts each: Arthur Askey, in 1942, 1955, 1968 and 1980, and Sir David Attenborough, in 1957, 1979, 1998 and 2012. Twelve have been on three times and a whopping 225 have appeared twice.

In 1992, John Major became the first, and only, serving Prime Minister to have appeared on the show.

When programme researchers invited Alistair MacLean on to the programme, they were expecting the best-selling author of books such as Where Eagles Dare and The Guns Of Navarone. Unfortunately, by mistake they invited Alastair MacLean, the European director of tourism for Ontario, Canada.

Ever the gentleman, Roy Plomley, the original presenter and creator of the show, covered up the error and the interview went ahead anyway, although it was never broadcast.

Guidebook author Alfred Wainwright agreed to go on the show in 1988 on condition that Sue Lawley went to Manchester to record the programme, as he refused to go to London. A friend drove him to the studio and on the way they had to stop at Harry Ramsden’s for fish and chips. For his ‘book’ he chose two photographs: one of his wife and the other of the 1928 Blackburn Rovers FC team.

One listener wrote in to criticise the emphasis on famous guests and offered himself instead. ‘As a retired Post Office worker,’ he wrote, ‘I think I qualify and I enclose a list of my eight records. I am available most days except Thursdays, when I go to Old Time dancing.’

THE THINGS THEY SAID

Lauren Bacall (1979) was a difficult guest. When Plomley asked her to pick just one of her eight records, she exploded. ‘What is this? You said I had eight records. Now you’re saying I only have one?’

Jack Lemmon (1989) revealed that his mother was so keen to finish  her bridge game that he ended up being born in a lift, while Fay Weldon (2010) said she believed she has psychic powers.

In 2002 Gordon Ramsay told presenter Sue Lawley he’d played first-team football for Rangers: ‘I got my first-team games. I was with the first-team squad. I played three first team games.’

It was later reported that, according to the club, he was just a trialist: ‘He trained with us for a few months but then got injured.’

Iain Duncan Smith (2002) revealed that his father was once chatted up by Marilyn Monroe. ‘I’m told nothing happened, but that’s what my mother tells me, so I’m not quite certain.’

Wendy Richard (1995) didn’t like being asked anything other than anodyne questions. She stopped Sue Lawley four times in the course of the recording and was distressed when she wasn’t allowed to take her pet Cairn terrier to the island as a luxury.

‘She asked why the dog was such a life-and-death business,’ said the actress, ‘and I told her the truth: because she is my best friend. I had to take my tapestries instead.’

DISCS

The
most popular classical works from which excerpts have been picked are 
Mozart’s The Marriage Of Figaro and Handel’s Messiah, which have both 
been chosen 109 times. The most popular hymn is Ave Maria, having been 
selected 42 times.

Topping
the Christmas carols list are In The Bleak Midwinter, Once In Royal 
David’s City and Silent Night, all on 13. Where words have been chosen 
over music, Dylan Thomas comes out on top, being selected 45 times. 
T. S. Eliot is second, on 17, and Sir John Betjeman third, on nine.

The
only castaway to choose silence as a record was poet Ian McMillan, who 
picked John Cage’s 4’33 which is, of course, four minutes 33 seconds of 
silence. It was also his favourite record. Only a few seconds were 
played, during which McMillan’s stomach was heard to rumble.

A number of castaways have chosen 
recorded sounds. Ann Widdecombe chose those of a hippo. Ice skater Robin
Cousins chose the Thunderbirds theme tune by Barry Gray. Nigella Lawson
was the only castaway to choose a song by the cartoon pop band The 
Archies.

Patrick Stewart was so keen to appear on the show that he 
claimed to have carried around a list of his choices. Fortunately for 
him, he was picked in 2005.

The former Home Secretary Herbert Morrison, 
who was said to have kept a permanent selection in his top pocket, never
did appear.

In 2006, when David Cameron picked 
This Charming Man by The Smiths, the group’s guitarist, Johnny Marr, was
angry enough to tell the future Prime Minister to stop saying he was a 
fan of the group. Cameron also chose Benny Hill’s Ernie (The Fastest 
Milkman In The West), which he said was the only song whose words he 
could remember.

THOSE WHO CHOSE THEIR OWN WORK

In
1981 Princess Grace of Monaco chose a recording of herself and actor 
Richard Pasco delivering The Proud Horse from Shakespeare’s poem Venus 
And Adonis. And in 1990 Barbara Windsor picked herself singing the theme
song from the film Sparrows Can’t Sing, in which she starred.

Max
Bygraves (1955) couldn’t resist himself singing You’re A Pink 
Toothbrush, while in 2011 Professor Brian Cox chose King Of Spades by 
Dare, a band of which he was a member.

Emma
Thompson (2010) looked to her own father for inspiration, choosing 
Florence, It’s A Lovely Morning, from the film version of The Magic 
Roundabout, which was created by her father Eric.

LUXURY ITEMS

Archies fan: Nigella Lawson

The luxury item was introduced in 1951. The first castaway to choose one was actress Sally Ann Howes, who went on to play Truly Scrumptious in the film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Her luxury was garlic.

The only time a castaway has been allowed to take a living person as a luxury was when Dame Edna Everage insisted on taking her bridesmaid, Madge Allsop.

According to the then presenter, Sue Lawley, ‘I reminded her that the luxury had to be an inanimate object. She assured me that Madge was exactly that. So I allowed it.’

When David Dimbleby was asked in 2008 by presenter Kirsty Young for his luxury, he replied, ‘I’ll take you.’

Duncan Goodhew chose a wig, and when Morecambe and Wise appeared on the show, Eric chose a deckchair and Ernie chose a deckchair ticket-machine.

Julian Clary chose an all-purpose prosthetic arm, Alison Steadman went for hot lemon flannels (as provided in Chinese restaurants), and Kathy Burke picked a life-size laminated photo of James Caan from Dragons’ Den, on which she planned to bodysurf.

John Cleese wanted Michael Palin (stuffed), Noel Edmonds chose a motorway service station and while Helen Mirren opted for silk underwear, Sue Lawley requested an iron and ironing board when she was a castaway.

Ian McEwan asked for Italian hand-stitched walking boots, but Lynn Barber insisted she needed a cyanide pill. Kevin Whately couldn’t live without Northumbrian bagpipes and Simon Cowell chose a mirror.

BOOKS

The most popular novelist is Charles Dickens, chosen by 61 castaways, followed by Leo Tolstoy on 50 and Marcel Proust on 48.

Prunella Scales chose Shakespeare’s complete works in  German, as well as the complete works in English automatically offered. 

Simon Cowell is the only castaway to have picked Jackie Collins’s Hollywood Wives.

George Clooney (2003) chose Tolstoy’s War And Peace as his book, ‘as there may not be toilet paper . . . and that’s a huge book’.

Some castaways are not great readers. Showjumper Harvey Smith told Plomley: ‘I’ve never read a book in my life and I don’t intend to start for you, sir’, while Jamie Oliver admitted, ‘I don’t read books’, and instead requested note-paper and pens to write recipes.

THE THEME TUNE

Eric Coates’s By The Sleepy Lagoon has always been the show’s theme tune. It was inspired by a view from  Bognor Regis.

Desert Island Discs: Flotsam And Jetsam, by Mitchell Symons, is published by Bantam Press at £14.99.
