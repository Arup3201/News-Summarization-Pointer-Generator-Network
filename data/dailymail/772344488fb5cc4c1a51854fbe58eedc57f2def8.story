Lord McAlpine has accused Sally Bercow, the wife of the Commons Speaker, of adopting a 'cavalier' attitude after writing an allegedly libellous tweet linking him to false claims of child sex abuse.

The peer is suing Mrs Bercow for damages of up to £50,000 after she tweeted: 'Why is Lord McAlpine trending? *innocent face*', after a botched Newsnight investigation claimed an anonymous Conservative figure had sexually abused boys at a Welsh care home.

Legal papers obtained by The Sunday Times also say Mrs Bercow sought to 'trivialise' the matter and 'added insult to injury' in later tweets.

Row: Lord McAlpine's legal team say Sally Bercow was 'cavalier' with her tweets and also suggest they may have been politically motivated

Papers lodged at the High Court reveal 
that Bercow, 43, did not even watch Newsnight before posting the tweet and did not remove it for a month. McAlpine also suggests that her comments had a political motive.

The BBC has already paid McAlpine £185,000 in damages and McAlpine's lawyers are now seeking redress from Twitter users who identified him as the man in the erroneous Newsnight programme.

Outspoken Mrs Bercow has always denied her tweet was libellous, saying it was merely 'foolish'. She has instructed City lawyers Carter-Ruck to represent her.

A spokesman for the firm said at the time: ‘Lord McAlpine has issued and served proceedings for libel against Sally Bercow and we are representing her. He put in a claim of £50,000.’

Numerous Twitter users erroneously linked Lord McAlpine to the Newsnight broadcast. For the most part, an apology ended was sufficient to end the matter

Swiftly deleting abusive tweets may save offenders from being brought before court, the country’s leading prosecutor said today.

Keir
Starmer, director of public prosecutions, said it was 'relevant' for 
police to consider whether an offending tweet had been quickly deleted.

Speaking to Sky’s Dermot Murnaghan, he said he was holding a three-month consultation about the plan.

Libellous tweets, or messages which broke court orders or were threatening, would still face prosecution regardless, he added.

Mr
Starmer said: 'There’s a lot of stuff out there that is highly 
offensive that is put out on a spontaneous basis that is quite often 
taken down pretty quickly and the view is that those sort of remarks 
don’t necessarily need to be prosecuted.'

Most of the people who tweeted about his involvement have offered the 70-year-old Tory an apology, ending the matter.

However, he launched legal proceedings after he failed to reach an out-of-court settlement with Mrs Bercow.

The libel battle is expected to go to trial at the High Court in the next few months.

McAlpine's lawyers refer to Bercow's 'high public and media profile', adding: 'The defendant is also politically well connected.

'She has been a prominent campaigner for the Labour party and is the wife of the Speaker.'

After the furore surrounding the original tweet, Mrs Bercow posted on Twitter: 'Am TOTAL, irresponsible eejit for mentioning fact that he was trending on my timeline. So sorry.'

She later posted: 'I guess I'd better get some legal advice then. Still maintain was not a libellous tweet — just foolish.'

She deactivated her Twitter account in November but then reactivated it nine days later, but still did not delete the original tweet until mid-December.

Neither party was available for comment tonight.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
