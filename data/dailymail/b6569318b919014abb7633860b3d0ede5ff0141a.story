Meet Rupert the whippet who loves nothing better than dressing up and posing for the camera.

Whether playing a game of tennis, reading the morning newspaper or even doing the ironing, these hilarious pictures show the dog has a real knack for striking a fetching pose.

Rupert began starring in the snaps at 10-months-old, when his owner Janet Burton, 56, noticed him standing with his front legs rested on the lawnmower.

Ms Burton, who has owned whippets for the past 15 years, began to dream up hilarious scenarios and fetching outfits to match.

Now the two-and-a-half year old pet has become a dab hand at creating lifelike scenes and has featured as a doctor, tennis player and even a choir boy. 

'The photos started by accident,' explained Ms Burton who also owns two female whippets called Amethyst, 10, and Bessie, 10, fell in love with Rupert when he was just four-weeks-old.

'It had been a few years since we had a puppy. I didn't put him straight in with the other whippets so I had a cardboard box at the side of my bed so I could comfort him during the night. 

'Rupert had a habit of jumping up and putting his feet up to look at what I was doing. 'I just say 'hop' and he puts his feet up again. His facial expression looks like he is concentrating on the job, like he knows what he is doing. 

'I had only took pictures of pets because my children had grown up. Rupert replaces the human in the pictures. He doesn't mind wearing the outfits because whippets wear little jackets in the winter. The magic comes from his expressions.'

Mrs Burton, who captures the incredible photographs of her iPad, says Rupert loves taking part in the pictures.

'When he sees me with (the iPad) he starts wagging his tail and jumping up and posing because he knows he is going to get treats,' she added.

The mother-of-two, who says her and husband Paul, 55, have always owned animals, said Rupert's pictures were so popular, he even had his own social media pages.

She said: 'We just have fun with the pictures and they are a small snapshot of Rupert's day. 

'I was receiving so many messages from people enjoying the photos so we created a Facebook page just for his own pictures.'

Janet, a retired nurse, said the most touching compliment Rupert received was from across the pond when an American man told her the images had helped cheer up his mother who was having a bad day fighting her breast cancer.

She said: 'Sometimes it is the little things that make a difference.'

The creative owner comes up with inventive ways to get Rupert to strike the perfect post - such as hiding treats on the mouthpiece of a trumpet and taping a sponge to the window so it looks like he's cleaning.

Rupert has also starred in his own calendar which sold to fans in Hawaii, South Africa, Iceland, Australia and America. 

Janet, of Oaken, Staffordshire, said the pampered pooch still sleeps beside her bed and the last words he hears before drifting off to sleep are: 'Love you Rupert.'
