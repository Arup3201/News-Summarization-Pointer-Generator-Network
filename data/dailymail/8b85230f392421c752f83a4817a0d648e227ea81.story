For most people the concept of sticking their head in an alligators jaw is the stuff of nightmares, but for one alligator handler this scary task is all in a day's work.

Chris Gillette works at the Everglade Alligator Farm, where he entertains tourists by grappling with the park's gators.

During his routine the daring 24-year-old hauls the gator from the swamp by its tail and leaps onto its back.

Mr Gillette then prizes open the gator's jaw and rests his chin on the animal's teeth, while the park's visitors gasp in horror and amazement at his daring stunt.

Some might think Mr Gillette has bitten off more than he can chew by choosing to spend his time battling with the 300lb monsters.

But Mr Gillette is an expert at handling the reptiles and began working with them at various parks when he was 18, to help pay for his degree in environmental studies.

Prize-winning: Mr Gillette's talent for wrestling the reptiles has since landed him first prize in an alligator wrestling competition

Mr Gillette said: 'I love alligators, they're fascinating animals and I feel very privileged to work with them.

'When I first started I wasn't scared, I loved the rush and excitement of it and didn't even think of the dangers.

'I get much more nervous doing shows now as I'm more aware of the dangers involved.

'During my show I try to get as close to getting bit without actually getting bitten, its about balancing the audiences need for excitement with your own need of safety.

'We work with some very aggressive alligators at the park and if you're not careful there's a chance they could kill you.

Brave: Mr Gillette said: 'When I first started I wasn't scared, I loved the rush and excitement of it and didn't even think of the dangers'

'Our most aggressive alligator, Godzilla is extremely dangerous. If he's angry, goes into a feeding response or a death roll if he gets a hold of you, he's going to rip off your arm.

'Once the alligator locks its jaw on you there's no way of getting it off, they latch on and clamp onto you with such force there is no way to physically pry open the jaws by yourself.

'I am dicing with death, I have to be very careful. It's easy to become complacent when you're working with the alligators every day.

'But you have to remember that one of those days, that alligator could kill you.

Mr Gilette explained that he had a call a very close call with Godzilla recently when he cornered him at the alligator park during a show.

'He had me against a wall and he jumped up at me and tried to bite me in the head. If he'd have got a hold me he'd have caused some serious damage and possibly even killed me.

'Luckily I jumped out of the way and his jaw slammed shut less than an inch from my skin.

'He actually grazed my shoulder with his top jaw teeth and left a nice scar to remember the moment by.

'I pulled my shirt over the wound to cover the blood, jumped onto his back, and finished the show. That was a pretty hairy moment.

'I've been bitten during a show before, I just put my hand behind my back to hide the blood and carried on.

Mr Gillette said he has always had an interest in animals and grew up catching lizards, snakes and turtles.

He said: 'I kept a lot of lizards and turtles when I was younger, I was always in the wild as a child.

'As soon as I got home from school I went into the woods looking for animals, I enjoyed getting up close to them and taking photographs.

'I started working with smaller alligators when I was 15 and then larger alligators when I was around 17-18.

'I guess you can say the older I've got the further I've moved up the food chain.'

When Mr Gillette isn't wrestling alligators for visitors to the park, he's volunteering at animal wildlife parks.

He has also spent time in the Amazon and Costa Rica to help launch breeding programmes for crocodiles and other animals.

And he is hoping to do a masters in environmental studies in the near future.

He said: 'I'm not just some hillbilly guy who wrestles alligators.'I'm going to be working with animals and helping wildlife for the rest of my life.

'Maybe that will be wrestling alligators for many more years to come or something else I don't know yet, but whatever it is i'm sure it will be something exciting.'
