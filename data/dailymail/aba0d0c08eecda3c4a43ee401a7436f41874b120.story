Passengers and crew of the missing Malaysia Airlines MH370 flight most likely died from suffocation as the plane coasted into the ocean on autopilot, Australian officials have said.

In a new 55-page report, the Australian Transport Safety Board said investigators arrived at the conclusion after comparing conditions on the flight with previous disasters.

The news comes as authorities announced the Australian-led search will now focus on a 60,000 square kilometre area further south in the Indian Ocean.

Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said it was 'highly, highly likely' flight MH370 was on autopilot

The report narrowed down the possible final resting place from thousands of possible routes, while noting the absence of communications, the steady flight path and a number of other key abnormalities in the course of the ill-fated flight.

'Given these observations, the final stages of the unresponsive crew/hypoxia event type appeared to best fit the available evidence for the final period of MH370's flight when it was heading in a generally southerly direction,' the ATSB report said.

Officials said this suggested the plane was most likely to have crashed further south than previously thought.

They said they are confident the 
Boeing 777, carrying 239 people, was set to autopilot several hours 
before its demise into desolate and unmapped waters.

Deputy
 Prime Minister Warren Truss said: 'It is highly, highly likely that the
 aircraft was on autopilot otherwise it could not have followed the 
orderly path that has been identified through the satellite sightings.'

The new analysis comes more than 100 days after the plane disappeared on March 8 shortly after taking off from Kuala Lumpur bound for Beijing.

Mr Truss said the new phase of the search could take more than a year and involves mapping 23,000 square miles of ocean, while the previous search area was only 330 square miles

Investigators say what little evidence
 they have to work with suggests the plane was deliberately diverted 
thousands of kilometres from its scheduled route before eventually 
plunging into the Indian Ocean.

The
 search was narrowed in April after a series of acoustic pings thought 
to be from the plane's black box recorders were heard along a final arc 
where analysis of satellite data put its last location.

But
 a month later, officials conceded the wreckage was not in that 
concentrated area, some 1,600 km (1,000 miles) off the northwest coast 
of Australia, and the search area would have to be expanded.

'The
 new priority area is still focused on the seventh arc, where the 
aircraft last communicated with satellite. We are now shifting our 
attention to an area further south along the arc,' MrTruss told 
reporters in Canberra.

Truss
 said the area was determined after a review of satellite data, early 
radar information and aircraft performance limits after the plane 
diverted across the Malaysian peninsula and headed south into one of the
 remotest areas of the planet.

The
 next phase of the search is expected to start in August and take a 
year, covering some 60,000 sq km at a cost of A$60 million ($56 million)
 or more. The search is already the most expensive in aviation history.

The
 new priority search area is around 2,000km west of Perth, a stretch of
 isolated ocean frequently lashed by storm force winds and massive 
swells.

Two vessels, one 
Chinese and one from Dutch engineering company Fugro, are currently 
mapping the sea floor along the arc, where depths exceed 5,000 metres in
 parts.

A tender to find a commercial operator to conduct the sea floor search closes on Monday

The new search area has been the subject of an aerial search
 previously, but efforts will now head below the waves, combing the 
ocean floor which is some 5km deep in parts.

The shift was expected as the head of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, Martin Dolan, said last week it would move south.

'This
 site is a most likely place where the aircraft is resting,' he said. 
'The search is going to be painstaking â€“ of course we could be fortunate
 and find it in the first hour or the first day, but it could 12 
months.'

Mr Truss said Australia remained dedicated to the task of solving 'this greatest aviation mystery in total history.'

Malaysia airlines flight MH370 vanished during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8 with 239 passengers and crew aboard

The new analysis comes just days after Malaysian Airlines pilot Zaharie Shah, 53, was revealed to be the prime suspect behind the plane's disappearance.

Malaysian police made the announcement after discovering files on Shah's home flight simulator showing he practiced landing on small airfields, including several in the Indian Ocean.

The files had been deleted from the computer before officials seized it, but have since been recovered by detectives.

The criminal inquiry completed intelligence checks on all of the people on board the flight to Beijing via Kuala Lumpur, but the only individual arousing suspicion was Captain Zaharie.

The father-of-three was found to have no social or work-related future plans, unlike the rest of the crew including his co-pilot, Fariq Hamid.

The criminal inquiry, which is yet to rule out other reasons for the plane's disappearance including a mechanical failure and terrorism, has so far only released its results to foreign governments and their investigators.
