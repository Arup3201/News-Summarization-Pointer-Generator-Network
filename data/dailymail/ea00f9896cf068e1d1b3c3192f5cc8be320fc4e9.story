Crumbs, DM ... the much-loved animated TV hero Danger Mouse is to make a comeback.

The cartoon series, which ran for more than ten years until 1992, will make his return next year when it is screened by CBBC.

The white-clad rodent who wore a patch over one eye was voiced by Sir David Jason, while his sidekick Penfold was played by the late Terry Scott, although there has been no confirmation of stars who will be in the new run.

They're back - Penfold and Danger Mouse but no one yet knows who will provide the voices

The show, created by the Cosgrove Hall animation studios, originally ran on ITV and many viewers will recall Penfold’s catchphrase 'Crumbs DM' as well as the title music which featured the lines: ‘He’s the Greatest, He’s Fantastic, wherever there is danger he’ll be there.’

Despite the rise of other postal services in the years since the show ended, Danger Mouse and Penfold’s HQ will continue to be in a red post box, although it will now be packed with cutting-edge technology as befitting any modern action mouse.

And programme-makers say the eye patch will be replaced by an ‘i-patch’, with multiple state-of-the art functions. The new look for the character has yet to be unveiled.

FremantleMedia Kids & Family Entertainment owns the global TV and licensing rights to Danger Mouse and is joining the BBC to produce the new series which forms part of the division’s five year-partnership with BBC Children’s.

Co-creator Brian Cosgrove of the original show is a consultant on the 52-episode series, being made by Boulder Media and FremantleMedia Kids & Family Entertainment.

Cheryl Taylor, the controller of CBBC said: ‘Danger Mouse is the last word in debonair and delightfully eccentric heroics and with Penfold at his side the much-loved duo will win over a whole new generation of fans.’

Cosgrove said: ‘When I helped to create Danger Mouse I had no idea the show would be such a huge success both in the UK and overseas. I am delighted that a whole new generation will be introduced to his daring deeds and thrilled to be part of this new 21st century series. I can’t wait to find out what he’s been up to for the last 23 years.’

Cosgrove Hall - whose other TV hits included Chorlton And The Wheelies, Count Duckula and Jamie And The Magic Torch - went on to become part of ITV and was closed down in 2009.
