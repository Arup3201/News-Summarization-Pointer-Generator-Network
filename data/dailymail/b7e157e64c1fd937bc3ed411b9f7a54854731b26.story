They are neck-and-neck in the Barclays Premier League, their identical records separable only by their position in the alphabet.

But which of Chelsea and Manchester City boasts the better academy? We'll find out as their respective Under 21 teams meet at Hyde's Ewen Fields ground on Thursday night.

The London side currrently top the Under 21 Premier League but it's close, with fifth-place City just one-point behind them.

City, who are led by Patrick Vieira, are chasing a measure of revenge after Adi Viveash's Chelsea beat them 2-1 in the reverse fixture back in August.

And memories of last season's play-off semi-final will also be fresh in the mind, when eventual winners Chelsea beat City on penalties at the Etihad Stadium.

It should be a great showcase of emerging talent and you can follow all the action live. The match kicks off at 7.45pm.

Host commentator

Celina, who came on with less than 15 minutes to play, proved the hero with his late, late winner. 

Manchester City's next generation move above Chelsea in the standings with a two-point cushion. 

Bersant Celina comes off the bench to score what is surely the winner.

The second half substitute plays the ball to Ntcham and takes the return pass to fire past Beeney to restore his side's lead. 

Both sides pressing for the winner. Solanke, Loftus-Cheek and Ake have impressed since th break. 

Chelsea defender Aina makes a great run int the box to meet Musonda's cross but he mis-times his strike and it blazes over the bar. Great opportunity for Chelsea to take the lead. 

 

It's that man Solanke again as the Blues striker pounces in the box to level matters up. Chelsea, powered by Loftus-Cheek and Ake, have grown into this game in the second half and were fully deserving of that goal.

Manchester City will bump Chelsea off the top of the U21 Premier League table if they hold onto their lead in the second half. Can Chelsea respond? 

After conceding that early goal to Dominic Solanke, City have recovered and stamped their authority on this fixture. 

Brandon Barker and Thierry Ambrose have been outstanding for the home side with their goals helping City into a 2-1 lead at the break. 

There's plenty more goals left in this one you sense. Plenty to admire from both sides so far with Loftus-Cheek and Ake impressing in midfield for the Blues. 

It's the same story again. Barker unleashes a powerful shot but Beeney is equal to it before Ambroe follows up and heads over the bar. The Chelsea keeper's heroics have kept his side in this contest, no question.  

Barker shows great pace down the left and sends a teasing cross in the box. Ambrose takes a heavy touch on his right but manages to get a shot away on his left.

But Beeney comes to the rescue to thwart Ambrose once more. 

Ambrose makes no mistake this time! The City striker gets one-on-one with Beeney, after being played in by Jose Angel Pozo, and drives his shot past the Chelsea keeper in the 24th minute. 

Great comeback for City after conceding that early goal. They now lead 2-1 and are very much in control of this contest. 

The Chelsea goalkeeper who stands strong to City's Thierry Ambrose in the box. Ambrose got into a great position and releases a powerful shot but Beeney makes a great save to keep the scores level. 

Nathan Ake has made six appearances for the Chelsea first team under Jose Mourinho this season. Mourinho sees Ake as very much a member of his first-team squad but wants to see the youngster impose himself on a fixture like this. 

Ake and fellow Ruben Loftus-Cheek will certainly be players to watch tonight. 

What a reply from Manchester City. Brandon Barker makes a daring run down the left wing and equalises for the visitors. 

Frantic start to this contest at Hyde's Ewen Fields . Just 97 seconds between those two goals. 

Dominic Solanke get the Blues off to a perfect start with a well taken strike in the second minute! 

Gunn, Maffeo, Evans, Bryan, Angelino, Glendon (c), Ambrose, Ntcham, Pozo, Bytyqi, Barker. Subs: O'Brien, Bossaerts, Byrne, Celina, Hiwula
