New Rangers manager Stuart McCall has urged his players to pick themselves up after their recent woes as he targets promotion to the Scottish Premiership.

Rangers have only won one of their last five Championship matches and currently sit in third position, 22 points behind leaders Hearts.

And while an automatic promotion place looks to be beyond their reach, McCall is hoping to kick-start a run of results which will secure the Glasgow club a play-off place and help return confidence to the camp.

McCall told TalkSPORT: 'There is a good squad of players here but it’s down to them to start proving it and showing it.

'Confidence is low and everyone has just got to take a jersey and go out and play. The supporters have been outstanding as they always have been. They’ll back the players.

'Off the park, things have moved well with Rangers-minded people in charge now and we just need to get it right for the fans on the park.

'We’re just hoping one result breeds a bit of confidence, a bit of belief, and then we can kick on from there.

'It’s easy to talk a good game but we’ve got to start doing it on the park.'

McCall's first match in charge is at Ibrox on Saturday against bottom-of-the-table Livingston.
