A New Jersey man who thought he was building his dream home ended up with a worthless pile of bricks he says has cost him his happiness and all his money.

Humayun Akhtar, 66, built the sprawling Florham Park home for him and his wife in 2007. Almost immediately, he says, cracks began to appear throughout the house, which he soon learned was collapsing into its unsound foundations and sliding off the side of the hill on which it was built.

Now Akhtar is in a protracted court battle with builder JDN Properties, who he says have left him financially ruined and emotionally broken.

This home in Florham Park, New Jersey was meant to be Humayun Akhtar's $1.6 million dream home for him and his wife but substandard construction turned it into a nightmare

'I used to be a singing, laughing person,' Akhtar told WABC. 'I don't listen to music anymore. I haven't seen a movie in ten years, I can't relax anymore.'

Akhtar and his family have not spent a single night in the home, which has buckled so severely that a marble placed on the floor will roll freely without the slightest push.

'I spent all the money I had and I was cleaned out. I have nothing now,' he said. 

Akhtar successfully won a settlement against JDN Properties in 2011 for $7.4 million on claims the company defrauded him by cutting corners on soil beneath the foundation that wasn't strong enough to bear the house.

However, the company recently won an appeal of that decision.

JDN Properties argues they tried to get Akhtar to let them repair the home before the damages worsened.

Akhtar maintains he was too afraid the company would do a quick fix on the foundation. 

Now the case will be seen before a New Jersey jury, which will decide if JDN Properties knowingly defrauded Akhtar.

Meanwhile, Akhtar's attorney David Stanziale told ABC News that the home has gone into foreclosure. 

'This whole thing has destroyed my life,' Akhtar said. 'I feel like a fool. Now I have to live 250 years to recover all the money I lost.'
