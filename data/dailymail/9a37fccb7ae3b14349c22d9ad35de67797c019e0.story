High street giant John Lewis sold a tablet computer every second during a £179 million Black Friday rush that broke the department store's 150-year sales record.

Branches in London, York, Liverpool and Southampton also achieved record daily takings as shoppers rushed to snap up pre-Christmas bargains, while online sales for the week were up 42.2 percent on last year.

The Black Friday discounts and price matching deals helped the retailer to sales totalling £179.1 million, its highest ever weekly figure which was up 21.8 percent on the same period a year ago and 56.8 percent up on the previous week.

Record breaking: High street giant John Lewis sold a tablet computer every second during a £179 million Black Friday stampede that broke the department store's 150-year sales record

It also eclipsed the previous record of £164.4million, which was set during the week before Christmas last year and despite the large numbers of people through the doors, John Lewis said the atmosphere within stores had been 'calm'.

The chain's electrical department was the star performer with weekly sales up a record 40.9 percent. Samsung big-screen TVs were selling at the rate of one every minute on Friday.

Bargain-hunting shoppers had logged on to the John Lewis website when the clock struck 12 on Thursday night, sending traffic numbers up 300 percent in the early hours of Friday morning. 

Tablet and mobile traffic also increased 70 percent between midnight and 8am on Friday.

However, demand for products meant the website temporarily crashed as it struggled to cope, and some online visitors were asked to order their purchases over the phone instead.

Campaign: The chain's heart-warming penguin advertising campaign appears to have been paying off with the store reporting record takings

Despite the success of Black Friday, the chain, which has already won hearts this Christmas with its penguin-themed advertising campaign did not offer Cyber Monday sales. 

On Black Friday the chain said tablet and computer sales had risen 127 percent on the year, TVs and other visual equipment jumped 131 percent, and small electricals lifted by 66 percent.

Fashion also performed well for the week, rising 16.7 percent compared to a year ago, and posting record single-day sales on Black Friday.

Operations Director Dino Rocos said: 'There was clearly huge customer anticipation of Black Friday this year and we knew we had high expectations to meet, both in terms of the products we had on offer through our Never Knowingly Undersold commitment, and in ensuring that we fulfilled customer orders as promised.

'While the sales figures are attention-grabbing, for me our biggest achievement was delivering an operation which ran like clockwork. 

'We picked and packed 87 percent more online parcels on Saturday than we did last year, and to have delivered successfully on customer expectation is a testament to the work of our Partners both on Black Friday itself and in our forward-planning. 

'Our website coped well with exceptional demand whilst the atmosphere in our shops remained both seasonal and calm with customers enjoying extended opening hours and the great offers to be had.' 

The group has 42 John Lewis shops - 31 department stores, 10 John Lewis at Home, and a shop at Heathrow Terminal 2. It also owns supermarket Waitrose, which has around 280 outlets.

Independent retail analyst Nick Bubb said: 'John Lewis can certainly be pleased with their operational success in handling all the extra volume of business last week and they look to have got more than their share of Black Friday spending, but how much has been pulled forward from December and how much was pulled away from other high street retailers by that huge Black Friday spike remains to be seen.'
