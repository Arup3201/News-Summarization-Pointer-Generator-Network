Greece's Marxist finance minister Yanis Varoufakis displayed a volcanic temper during fraught talks with European leaders last week, with some observers fearing the discussions could descend into a punch-up.

But the explosive style of the so-called ‘rock star’ economist may have been part of a deliberately ‘schizophrenic’ negotiating technique conceived while Varoufakis was a student in Essex in the 1980s, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

After weeks of tense negotiations, European finance ministers finally announced on Friday that they had drafted the basis for an agreement to extend Greece’s bailout package for four months.

Endorsed by the full 19-member Eurogroup, it should be finalised tomorrow – effectively saving Greece from leaving the eurozone and going bankrupt.

During tense negotiations last week, Mr Varoufakis was said to have shouted ‘liar’ at Jeroen Dijsselbloem, chairman of the eurozone group of finance ministers, with some observers fearing that punches were about to be thrown.

But Mr Varoufakis’s erratic behaviour and outbursts may have been part of an orchestrated plan to build a ‘reputation’ to use as a bargaining tool.

The Mail on Sunday has seen Mr Varoufakis’s economic thesis submitted as part of his doctorate at the University of Essex in 1987. The 249-page document, titled Optimisation and Strikes, discusses bargaining positions between employers and unions and is a blueprint for how to win negotiations.

In it, Mr Varoufakis, who earlier this month wore a leather biker’s jacket and boots when he met Chancellor George Osborne, states that the workforce needs to accept their leader’s ‘peculiarities’ to get a good outcome.

It says: ‘In the aftermath of the strike they will have realised that in spite of his or her peculiarities their manager has come up with the goods.’ The thesis then discusses the merits of negotiating methods and how ‘irrational’ behaviour in the short term may enhance the long- term reputation of the negotiator – and get a better outcome.

It says the best negotiator is one who lives up to a ‘schizophrenic ideal’ and builds a reputation.

‘Reputation-building depends on the ability to punish the opposition and the time preference of the party in question, while at the same time, the ability to punish the opposition depends on solidarity which itself depends on the negotiator’s reputation and the level of utility derived from being loyal,’ it says.

Tellingly, Mr Varoufakis concludes: ‘Negotiators seeking to maximise the probability of persuading their opponents of their intransigence may attempt to convince themselves first. The ability to switch from “conviction bargaining” to “pragmatic” behaviour at the optimal point in time is of paramount importance. Negotiators approaching this ideal will be maximising their payoffs.’

Mr Varoufakis, who has described himself as ‘an erratic Marxist’, graduated from Essex University in 1981, gaining a 2.2 in mathematical economics. He was awarded a PhD in 1987.

The Greek Left-wing government, elected in January after promising to end austerity, stepped back from the brink last week, conceding that the current €240 billion (£180 billion) bailout would be extended pending further talks.

Refusing to continue the current bailout had been seen as a ‘red line’ for the Greek government, and accepting that the deal is still in place is widely seen as a climbdown. Varoufakis has until Monday night to present a list of reforms his government will carry out.
