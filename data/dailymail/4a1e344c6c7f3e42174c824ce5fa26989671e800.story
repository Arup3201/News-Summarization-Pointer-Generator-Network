A mother who endured the agony of seeing one of her identical twins born with a crippling form of cerebral palsy has been given hope by a surgeon in the U.S.

Dee Buchanan, 30, hopes a revolutionary operation will allow two-year-old Callum to finally keep up with his brother, Mitchell.

The nursery nurse gave birth to the twins three months prematurely after a difficult pregnancy, and at eight-months-old Callum was diagnosed with Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy – a form of cerebral palsy which causes tightness in the muscles of the lower body.

He now has a chance of walking thanks to American surgeons who will carry out a procedure to try and remove the abnormal sensory nerve fibres that cause his disability.

The boys' parents, from Tidworth, Hampshire, were delighted when they were told they were expecting twins.

But doctors at Salisbury District Hospital detected a problem with Mitchell's growth at Mrs Buchanan’s 20 week scan.

She was admitted to Princess Anne Hospital in Southampton for round-the-clock monitoring when she was 26 weeks pregnant.

The boys had to be delivered at 28 weeks because they developed a potentially fatal condition called twin-to-twin transfusion – this occurs when identical twins share a placenta and one baby receives more blood flow than the other.

As they were so premature, they were given brain scans, which revealed that Mitchell was perfectly healthy but Callum had a 'flare' on the back of his brain.

At eight months, Callum (left) was diagnosed with Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy - a form of cerebral palsy which causes tightness in the muscles of the lower body

The cerebral palsy means that Callum is unable to walk or crawl, so cannot keep up with Mitchell

It was diagnosed as periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), a type of brain injury which may have been caused by their traumatic birth, and which can lead to cerebral palsy.

Mrs Buchanan said: ‘Up until 20 weeks it had been a normal pregnancy but then they noticed a problem with Mitchell's growth.

‘He was not keeping up with Callum so they wanted to keep a closer eye on me.’

She added: ‘When Callum was diagnosed I took it in my stride because I was prepared. I knew he would need extra care and would need physiotherapy and possibly surgery.

‘It was PVL that caused Callum's cerebral palsy. It could have been triggered by lack of oxygen. They can't tell me what caused the PVL but it was a traumatic birth so it may have been that.’

The boys' parents are trying to raise £75,000 to allow Callum to have pioneering surgery in America

Paediatric neurosurgeon Dr T.S Park will carry out a Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR) procedure at the St Louis Children's Hospital in Missouri

Cerebral palsy affects the communication between the brain and the muscles, causing the muscles in Callum's legs to receive constant messages to tighten and contract.

This means that he is unable to walk of crawl.

However, in June he will travel to America for pioneering surgery to address the problem.

Paediatric neurosurgeon Dr T.S Park will carry out a Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR) procedure at the St Louis Children's Hospital in Missouri.

The operation will involve examining the sensory nerve fibres that enter the spinal cord from the muscles, and removing the abnormal 'rootlets' that cause his disability.

Mr and Mrs Buchanan found out about the procedure because another child at their local hospital had it and improved dramatically as a result

The procedure reduces the number of messages sent from the muscles and gives a better balance of nerve cell activity in the spinal cord.

To pay for the procedure and the stay in America, Callum’s parents have launched a fundraising campaign raise £75,000.

They have so far raised £35,000.

Mrs Buchanan said: ‘Callum is already starting to notice the differences between what he and Mitchell can do.

‘Surgeons in the UK would not look at Callum until he was four and a half, and they wouldn't operate until he was five.

In the UK, Callum (right) would not be eligible for surgery until he was five-years-old

‘The younger they get the operation the better. I don't want him to grow up feeling different to his twin.

‘Mitchell can sit, crawl, walk, run, get himself up and down stairs. Callum has no mobility at all without being assisted.

‘He can sit on the floor if he is supported but he can't crawl or kneel. He has no balance.

She added: ‘Sometimes he is cheeky with it. He will sit and tilt his head at you then throws himself back on the floor and start laughing.

‘He is such a good boy. Ninety per cent of the time he is happy. He can wake up during the night and have tightness in his legs. That's when he gets upset.

It is thought that the boys' traumatic birth may have caused Callum to have periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) - a type of brain injury which can lead to cerebral palsy

Mitchell (pictured) is completely healthy despite being born so early

‘As far as everything else goes, he's fine. His speech is actually better than his brother's.’

Callum has frequent hospital appointments and follows a strict regime of physiotherapy to build up his core muscles.

His parents found out about the SDR operation when another young patient at the Princess Anne Hospital underwent it and experienced a massive improvement.

They researched the surgery then contacted the St Louis hospital and sent doctors a video of Callum to see whether he would be a suitable candidate.

He was approved, and the couple began a fundraising campaign called Callum's Walking Wish.

They will travel to America for a pre-surgery assessment in June, followed by the operation three days later.
