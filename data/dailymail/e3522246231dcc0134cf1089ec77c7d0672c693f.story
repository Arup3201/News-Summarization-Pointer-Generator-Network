An emotional Ann Romney has revealed the personal and private homage her husband Mitt will perform before his first presidential debate with Barack Obama this evening.

Tearing up, Ann Romney said that when the Republican candidate arrives at his podium, he will remove his watch, place it to one side and then simply write 'Dad' on a piece of paper in front of him to remember his late father and former Michigan governor George Romney.

Explaining that her husband does this each time he prepares to enter a political debate, Ann Romney said that the Republican candidate would then look out into the crowd for her, unable to feel secure unless he had caught her eye.

Speaking to CNN, Ann Romney revealed that her husband has a three part ritual that he goes through before he is ready to speak in a political debate

'As soon as he gets on stage...he takes off his watch and puts it on the podium...then he writes 'Dad' on the piece of paper,' said Ann Romney to CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger.

'And that's amazing, because he loves his dad, respects his Dad. Doesn't want to do anything that would not make his father proud... I love the fact that Mitt does that. So he writes that.'

'And then he looks in the audience and he finds me. He has to find where I am.

'And– he just– he needs just that connection. And almost after every answer that he gives, he'll find me in the audience, to see, 'Was that good? Was that okay?'

During the interview, Mrs. Romney said that her family has given her the nickname, 'the Mitt Stabilizer.'

'I'm there for him. We're there for each other emotionally all the time,' said Mrs. Romney.

'In the last 20 debates that we did in the primary– I felt that was my most important role.

'There's an emotional connection that's happening between the two of us during the debate itself.'

And as her husband prepares for the most important public political debate of his career, Mrs. Romney said that the only advice she has given him is to be himself.

'He has to feel what he's gotta say, when he's gotta say it,' said Mrs. Romney.

'He's gotta listen to his own instincts. And of course it's– he's gonna be getting a lot of advice.

'But he's gotta listen to his own instincts more than anyone else's and trust that.'

Speaking up for her husband, who is notorious for his stilted public persona, Mrs. Romney has emerged as his character witness and defender in chief.

She admonishes her husband's Republican critics, and tries to convince women that Mitt Romney is on their side.

She also counters the portrait her husband's opponent paints of a soul-less corporate raider, and seeks to show his softer side, like she did Tuesday when she recalled how he made regular visits in the 1970s to a 14-year-old who was dying of cancer, even helping the boy write his will.

'That is where Mitt is when someone's in trouble, he's there, he's by the bedside,' Ann Romney told a crowd at a park in this vote-rich area as her husband stayed out of sight ahead of Wednesday's debate.

'Right now the country's in trouble. We need someone who cares, who truly understands what is going on.'

Michelle Obama told CNN that she never offers her husband any advice before a speech or debate adding that she feels he knows what he is doing by now

Her biggest appearance to date came at the GOP convention in Tampa, Fla., as she spoke in greatly personal details about the man she's been married to for four decades - and made a direct pitch to a group of voters with whom Obama has an edge in polling.

'I love you women! And I hear your voices,' she said, delivering a forceful defense of her husband's character and values in a speech designed to introduce the country to the man she knows better than anyone.

In Denver on Tuesday, a KUSA-TV viewer asked whether she and her husband really have a finger on pulse of Americans if they've never struggled.

'Struggle is an interesting thing,' Ann Romney responded. 'I can tell you Mitt and I have struggled a great deal, that we can understand people who are going through difficulties right now because we have gone through our own personal hardships.

'You don't have to struggle in exactly the same way to have compassion for others. And if you look at the measure of who he is, how generous he has been his entire life and helping others, you have to know that this guy does care.'

And as both candidates keep low profiles before Wednesday evening's debates, Michelle Obama has revealed the worries that she goes through watching her husband speak.

'I get so nervous at these debates,' said Michelle Obama to CNN Chief White House Correspondent Jessica Yellin.

'I'm like one of those parents watching their kid on the balance beam. You're just standing there trying not to you know, have any expression at all.'

Revealing that she offers him little advice beforehand, Mrs. Obama said that afterwards she only offers, 'positive reinforcement.'

'He doesn't need much advice,' she said.

'He's a very good debater, so I do tell him to have fun and relax and just be himself.'
