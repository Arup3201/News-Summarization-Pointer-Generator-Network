Eight teenage girls from the same school have been radicalised under the noses of their teachers, it emerged last night.

Four girls from Bethnal Green Academy in East London have already run away to Syria to join Islamic State. Now four more from the same school have expressed an interest in Islamic extremism.

The worrying rise in fanaticism among girls at the school was laid bare at the High Court yesterday.

A judge banned five girls – three of whom are 16 and two 15 – from travelling abroad after they showed an interest in going to Syria. 

He ordered their passports to be taken off them and for them to be made wards of the court.

Four of the girls, from Bethnal Green Academy, are associated with the four girls who have already joined IS to become ‘jihadi brides’. The fifth is schooled at home. 

Concerns for their welfare were raised by police after classmates Kadiza Sultana, 16, Shamima Begum, 15, and Amira Abase, 15, fled to Syria last month.

 The trio followed in the footsteps of 15-year-old Sharmeena Begum, also from Bethnal Green Academy, who left for Syria in December.

Mr Justice Hayden made the move to bar travel following an application from Tower Hamlets social services. He was told social workers had raised concerns that the girls might flee to areas controlled by IS.

A number of adults involved in their care have also had their passports seized. There was evidence to suggest family members had not been ‘full and frank’ with social services, the judge said, and the girls were becoming ‘more radicalised’.

The judge said the identity of the five girls should not be revealed but the name of the school could be published because most staff and pupils would know who they were.
