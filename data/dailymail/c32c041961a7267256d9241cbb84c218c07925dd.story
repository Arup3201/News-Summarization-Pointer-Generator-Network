'Not here though, right?' 'You're, like, a legit nurse?' 'This is awkward.' Yes, no and absolutely, but it was all for a good cause as YouTube prank video group Simple Pickup took on the taboo nature of testicular exams.

Their video stars Marissa, an attractive woman in a novelty nurse's uniform and armed with a supply of rubber gloves and the offer to perform touch tests on men's genitals. 

For every taker, the group pledged to donate $100 (£64) to the Movember campaign and for every 100,000 views their video received over 30 days they would donate the same amount again.  

Marissa, of the YouTube prankster group Simple Pickup offers free testicle exams on Los Angeles street

After a sheepish response from passers-by, one man is up for the free (if not qualified) check-up

Not surprisingly, the Los Angeles street they chose to patrol with their sign simply labelled 'Free Testicle Exams' there were plenty of skeptical blokes. 

Comments such as the 'I just have a passion for testicles', in jest of course, no doubt didn't help.  

And of course there was a combination of curious looks from those wandering by and other taking out their camera phones to record the moment.   

This man's willingness to participate made a further $100 for Movember

Some men were more willing than others to show their face during the exam though it was a public street

But there were six takers, meaning $600 (£383) for the Movember campaign, and five days after the video was first posted there have been more than 3.5million views on their official channel.That means a total ticking well over $4,100 (£2,600).

'In all seriousness, we did this video to show that you are just as qualified as I am to give yourself a thorough examination,' Marissa says at the end of the clip. 

'So, I want you to do it right now [as her two colleagues oblige]. So if you notice any lumps or swelling, visit your doctor immediately.
