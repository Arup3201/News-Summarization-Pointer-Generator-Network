The manhunt for a convicted bank robber who fled a Chicago jail has claimed the life of a family's beloved pet.

Chanette Weaver has said her dog was shot dead by officers searching for Kenneth Conley who escaped from prison last Tuesday using knotted bed sheets.

Ms Weaver has alleged the officers shot dead her six-year-old Rhodesian Ridgeback mix Kobi after she put him in a fenced-in yard at about 6.50am on Christmas Eve.

She said a Hazel Crest police officer knocked on her door five minutes later to tell her the dog had died.

Neighbours have said police later asked questions about Conley as they believed he was hiding at a house next to the Weavers.

Ms Weaver told CBS Chicago the police said they had been acting in self-defence when they shot the dog.

'He said "Ma’am, your dog was getting ready to attack one of my officers." And they shot him three times,' Ms Weaver said.

Hazel Crest police has said officers felt they were at risk after the dog tried to attack them on a public path.

Jailbreak: Ropes hang down the side of the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center after Conley and Banks escaped

Conley, 38, is still on the run after he descended a 20 storey drop from a window of the Metropolitan Correctional Center last week with Joseph 'Jose' Banks, who was captured last Thursday by by agents and officers from the Chicago FBI Violent Crimes Task Force, and officers from the Chicago Police Department

Joseph Banks is known as the 'second-hand bandit' for wearing used clothes during his crimes.

The 37 year-old was captured by officers without incident. The two men had been on the run for hours before the escape was reported.

Banks was convicted the week before the escape of robbing two banks and attempting to rob two others.

Authorities say he stole almost $600,000, and most of that still is missing.

During trial, he had to be restrained because he threatened to walk out of the courtroom.

He acted as his own attorney and verbally sparred with the prosecutor, at times arguing that U.S. law didn't apply to him because he was a sovereign citizen of a group that was above state and federal law.

Conley pleaded guilty last October to robbing a Homewood Bank last year of nearly $4,000.

Conley, who worked at the time at a suburban strip club, wore a coat and tie when he robbed the bank and had a gun stuffed in his waistband.
