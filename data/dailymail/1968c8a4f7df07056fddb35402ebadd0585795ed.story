Shoppers have been given a sneak peek of the hotly-anticipated Kate Young for Target collection.

Terry Richardson photographed four up-and-coming starlets wearing the Hollywood stylist's purse-friendly designs on the red carpet, as part of a pre-release campaign shoot.

Highlights of the spring womenswear line include satin-look shorts, a thigh-baring gown and classic black heels.

For the campaign shot Ms Young and Target chose four 'it' girls with completely different backgrounds.

The line-up includes New York DJ Leigh Lezark, aspiring actress Nathalie Love,
fledgling model Hailey Gates and Lily Kwong - a writer who was
featured in Vogue’s 120th anniversary issue last year as one of the 120
biggest fashion influencers.

The quartet strike a pose wearing a 
range of red carpet-worthy garments against a step-and-repeat backdrop 
plastered with the Kate Young for Target logo.

Target announced in January that Ms
Young, stylist to the likes of Natalie Portman and Michelle Williams, 
would be launching a budget collection this April.

The mother-of-two was named Hollywood’s Most Powerful Stylist by The Hollywood Reporter last year, due in large part to her expert styling of pregnant Natalie Portman at her high-profile Black Swan premieres.

The
Target line will focus on evening-wear, and early sketches showed 
flowing cream evening gowns and Peter Pan collar tea dresses.

The collection will make her coveted 
red carpet style available and affordable, with 
semi-formal and special occasion dresses ranging in price from $29.99 to
$89.99.

The collection will also include jewelry, handbags and shoes, available on the Target website only, priced between $14.99 and $49.99.

Said Ms Young in a press release: ‘I’ve been working with Target for a number of years as a stylist, so having the chance to design my own collection with a brand I already know and love is like a dream come true.’

Ms Young, who is married to music 
executive Keith Abrahamsson, also styles red carpet favorites including 
Michelle Williams and Rachel Weisz.

Collaboration: Stylist to the stars Kate Young is to create a collection for Target inspired by her red carpet looks

Though she has years of experience styling celebrities with other designers' creations, this will be the first time she can call the looks her own.

'With this collection, I wanted to design standout pieces that allow women to experiment with fashion and create their own red carpet moments,' she said in an interview with ABC News.

Target has enjoyed immense success with 
previous designer collaborations including one with Missoni which 
launched in 2011. The retailer is also introducing a collection 
co-designed by Prabal Gurung in February.

In a statement to WWD,
a Target Corp. spokesman explains, ‘As [designer collaborations] have 
become more common, our partnerships have taken on many different 
shapes.’

The collaboration means that Ms Young's fashion influence, which until now stretched only as far as the red carpet, will soon extend its reach to the masses.

Said Ms Young in an interview with Refinery 29: 'As a stylist, I wanted to create a collection that allows and encourages all 
women to create their own red carpet moments, no matter the occasion.'

The celebrity stylist’s collection will hit stores and Target.com on April 14.
