The mother of a nine-month-old girl was left baffled when her daughter's day care provider sent a note home complaining that her baby was playing roughly with other children and then smiling about it.

The handwritten letter was given to the mother, identified only as Vero, on February 13. It was later shared on a social media group for working mothers before being picked up by the parenting blog Babble.

Babble writer and working mom Alice Gomstyn called out the author of the note for chastising the infant for being aggressive with her friends, and then demanding of her mother to do something to stop her roughhousing.

Complaint: This handwritten note was given to the mother, identified only as Vero, on February 13, chastising her infant Samantha for being aggressive and rough with her friends.

According to the controversial missive, Vero's 9-month-old daughter named Samantha 'has been playing roughly and aggressively’ with the other babies in the group.

The author of the note goes on to say that after sowing mischief around her and leaving her friends upset and in tears, little Samantha 'is smiling and enjoying herself.'

Samantha also was apparently not impressed when workers at the day care center told her in their 'firm voices' that it was not acceptable to hurt others and gave her a time out.

Instead of learning her lesson, according to the note, the naughty 9-month-old broke into a smile and went 'right back' to the play area.

The letter concludes with a plea to the child's parents asking them to help change her behavior.

'Can you help us out by maybe discouraging her to not play roughly with her friends and her dog [?]'

According to Gomstyn's blog post about the letter, Samantha's mother was angered by the day care's suggestion that her daughter was somehow consciously drawing pleasure from hurting others.

Dr Adelle Cadieux, a psychologist at Helen DeVos Children’s Hospitals in Grand Rapids, Michigan, told Gomstyn that children Samantha's age go through a phase where they are excited to see the effects their actions cause, and they cannot yet recognize that what they are doing maybe be hurtful to others.

Research also shows that it is normal for children between the ages of 6-8 months to begin behaving in an aggressive manner because they are eager to express themselves but are not yet verbal.

The child development expert noted that telling a mother her baby's is being aggressive is at the very least unhelpful because as far as advice goes, it is too vague. 

‘Saying, “I’m concerned about your child because I’m observing something different,” is a great way to begin a conversation as opposed to, “Hey, your kid’s being aggressive and you need to do something about it,”’ she said.
