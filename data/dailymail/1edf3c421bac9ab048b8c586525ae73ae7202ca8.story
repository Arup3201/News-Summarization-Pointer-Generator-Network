Have you ever been uncomfortably constipated, unable to go to the loo even though you desperately need to?

If so, you're not alone, as it's estimated that around one in every seven adults and up to one in every three children has constipation at any one time.

Now, one expert advises that a hot drink could solve the problem. 

This is because hot beverages such as coffee, tea - or even a cup of hot water - stimulate the bowel, easing constipation.

Dr Felice Schnoll-Sussman, a gastroenterologist at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University, US, said hot drinks widen blood vessels, aiding digestion.

Hot beverages such as coffee, tea - or even a cup of hot water - stimulate the bowel, easing constipation. 

Her advice is backed up by a study which found hot drinks do indeed induce a 'desire to defecate'.

'The warm liquid acts as a vasodilator,' she told Runners World magazine, while giving advice to marathon runners who want to avoid being constipated during a big race.

'It widens blood vessels in the digestive system and helps increase blood flow and GI activity.'

But caffeine isn't responsible, as even decaffeinated coffee brings on the desire to go to the loo, she said.

Drinking a cup of coffee and then sitting on the loo should help stimulate a bowel movement, she added. 

'Just the act of sitting there for few minutes can bring on the urge to go, even if you don't feel like you have to right away,' she said.

Physical activity can also induce a trip to the loo, she advised. 

Massaging the perineum – the area between the anus and the genitals – can help ease constipation, a study found.

In a trial, 72 per cent of people taking part found self-acupressure helped them have a bowel movement.

Researchers advised that all doctors should consider this technique as the first thing constipated people could try – along with conventional treatment like eating more fibre, drinking more fluid and taking more exercise.

The study’s author Dr. Ryan Abbott, UCLA Centre for East-West Medicine, US, said: “Constipation is very common and can have debilitating symptoms.

‘But patients can perform this simple intervention themselves to treat their own constipation and improve their quality of life. It can also help to limit health care costs and excessive medication use.”

The research was published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.

Therefore, people with constipation should consider jogging up and down stairs, or doing star jumps or stretches to stimulate the bowel.

And last year U.S. researchers found massaging can help pass a stool.

Researchers found applying gentle pressure to the perineum – the area between the anus and genitals – helped constipated people have a bowel movement.

This 'self-acupressure' broke up hard stools, relaxed muscles and stimulated nerves responsible for bowel movements, easing constipation, they found.

They said doctors should consider this technique as the first thing to try – along with conventional treatments like drinking more fluid, eating more fibre, taking more exercise, or taking laxatives.

The World Gastrology Organisation defines constipation as people who pass fewer than three bowel movements a week; feel a quarter of their stools are hard or feel a sense of incomplete evacuation in more than a quarter of their movements. 

Doctors advise most cases of constipation can be treated with diet and lifestyle changes, as it can be caused by not eating enough fibre, changing eating habits and ignoring the urge to go to the loo.

Sometimes, constipation is a side-effect of certain medications such as codeine, or supplements such as iron, or can be caused by anxiety or depression.
