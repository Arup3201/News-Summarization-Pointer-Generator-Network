Spring officially starts this week and households up and down the country will no doubt been thinking about giving their homes a good dusting, de-cluttering and getting rid of any lingering winter blues.

There are several things mums can do to spend less and save more this Spring, says Kalpana

1) Go second hand for children’s goods

Ever wondered where the smart mums shop for their children's clothes and toys? Well, the savviest are heading for table-top sales boasting excellent-quality goods for bargain prices.

Parenting charity NCT holds regular nearly-new sales offering clothes at knock-down prices - such as baby grows from as little as 50p for not one, but five. Toys - often in very good condition - cost as little as £2 and children's DVD are on offer from just £1.

And it's not just baby bargains savvy shoppers will find - there is a great selection for children too.

There's little point buying all-new clothes for little ones as they grow out of them so quickly. 

The NCT has strict quality guidelines for sellers, plus buyers can inspect the items before purchasing. For those who are good at haggling, you'll walk away with more bang for your buck.

Check the NCT for details of locations and dates of these sales. They are held nationwide and throughout the year.

2) De-clutter and sell unwanted goods

Now is the time to go through your cupboards and get rid of anything you no longer need or use. To make a few extra pennies that could go towards pocket money for the kids, or spending money for your family holiday, why not consider selling these items?

At NCT sales, table hire is around £20, but, if you have plenty of decent things on offer, you could walk away with hundreds of pounds. You can sell furniture - so for mothers with items like cots and even wardrobes, it's the perfect marketplace. 

Don’t worry about having to fit everything into your car. Instead, take pictures of any bulky goods to place on a noticeboard on the day. You’ll be surprised at just how popular these are.

For non-child-related goods, try a boot sale. They start up in spring and run until October, with an entrance fee to pay. Just be prepared to get up early to bag a space! Check out CarBootSales for locations and dates. 

Car-boots sales are a great way to have a clear-out of unwanted goods and also pick up a little extra cash

3) Buy school uniforms from the supermarket

School uniforms are expensive – but there are ways to cut costs.

The first tip is to avoid buying items such as plain shirts, dresses and bottoms from uniform shops where the prices are significantly higher. 

For example, a plain polo shirt from a niche shop may set you back about £5 each, but a pack of two from the supermarket costs as little as £2.50 – that’s just £1.25 each. You could put the savings towards other expenses, such as school trips.

Some school uniform items do have to be purchased via a uniform shop because a certain logo or style must be adhered to.

If this is the case, and if you're looking to save some pennies, see if you can get them second-hand. Many schools will sell once-worn clothes, but you may have to ask. You could also ask other parents if they are willing to sell anything that their child has outgrown.

4) Use cashback sites

These aren't anything new, but if you're not already using a cashback site, it's the perfect way to easily save some money and earn rewards.

They work by giving shoppers a percentage of their purchase total every time you shop online via a specific cashback site.

Simply register for free, then click through to your chosen retailer, such as Mothercare or Argos, and then shop as normal.

The purchase is tracked and the cashback site will give you back some money; rates can vary from as little as 1 per cent to as much as 10 per cent. Some stores also offer you a cash lump sum.

And it's not just limited to retailers, you can also earn cashback for utilities (broadband, TV, phone), insurance and even days out.

New Sky customers, for example, could get £151.50 cashback for TV and broadband packages via Topcashback, £30 cashback for using Uswitch via Quidco and 2 per cent back on Amazon purchases using Kidstart.

You really could end up with hundreds of pounds back into your pocket - but only ever use reputable cashback sites. 

5) Use Tesco Clubcard vouchers to pay for days out

If you’re collecting Tesco Clubcard points, then use your vouchers to pay for days out using Clubcard Boost.

It’s tempting to stick them in your purse and pay for everyday groceries when you go shopping, but they are worth a lot more if you use Clubcard Boost – you could exchange them for up to four times the face value.

Use Tesco Clubcard vouchers to pay for days out instead - these can be exchanged for cinema tickets

A £4.50 voucher is worth just £4.50 if you use it to pay for groceries, but if you boost it online, that will get you a day pass to a Sealife Centre where a child ticket otherwise costs around £20 – that’s a saving of more than 75 per cent.

You could also use your vouchers to exchange them for cinema tickets or eating out. Take a look at Tesco to see the deals.

6) Plan your meals

For a family, food is a huge weekly cost. But it is also an area where you can easily save some money.

As well as shopping smart and buying own-brand products where possible, the next thing to do is to plan your meals.

Devise three or four and rotate them every week to ensure there is variety. But, this way, you won't get tempted by expensive treats while wandering around the supermarket - and it will ensure all food is used; rather than wasted or thrown away. 

Always go shopping with a list - and stick to it. Better still, do your shop online – that way you can avoid all those 'buy one get one free' or 'half price' deals, not to mention it will probably reduce stress and give you more quality time with your children.

7) There’s still time to make use of childcare vouchers

Childcare costs are rising faster than the rate of inflation. Recent research from the Family & Childcare Trust showed a 33 per cent increase in the past five years, and a report last week from single parent charity, Gingerbread, found half of single parents have had to borrow money from friends, family or banks to pay for childcare in the last two years.

With costs so high, it’s important to make use of all the financial help you can get.

If you are working and are not making use of childcare vouchers, then you should – you could save as much £933 a year, per parent, towards the costs of childminders, nurseries, play groups and after school care or clubs.

Childcare vouchers are essentially salary sacrifice schemes and you make savings through tax. It is offered by employers, so talk to your HR department about it.

The system is, however, changing in Autumn 2015, with a new tax-free childcare scheme being introduced, after which you will not be able to apply for childcare vouchers, but existing users will be able to continue using them if they want. 

Some parents will be better-off with the existing childcare voucher scheme, as the new system will not help you if you have children over the age of 12 for instance – so, it is a good idea to apply for childcare vouchers now and then choose what is better for you in the Autumn when the new scheme kicks in.

Some parents may also be able to get tax credits, but childcare vouchers can affect the amount of tax credits you get, so check the Gov.uk calculator to find out whether you would be better-off.
