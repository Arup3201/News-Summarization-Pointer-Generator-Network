Ross Barkley is emerging as a genuine contender to start for England at the World Cup after his bravura display against Ecuador, but Stuart Pearce insists he should not be in Brazil this summer at all.

The former England Under 21 boss claims that Roy Hodgson is harming England's long-term chances of success by picking young players such as Barkley and Luke Shaw and leaving them on the bench, rather than handing them guaranteed game time in international age-group football.

The 20-year-old Everton playmaker showed off his supreme natural talent during the 2-2 draw against the South Americans in Miami on Wednesday, capping a sparky performance by setting up Rickie Lambert for England's second goal with a cheeky nutmeg, powerful run and cushioned pass to the striker.

But Pearce, the former England defender who is now Nottingham Forest manager and coached the young lions at four European Championships between 2007 and 2013, believes Barkley has 'got a lot to learn' and would be better off tasting the style and pressure of international football below senior level before his eventual promotion.

Selecting young players like Barkley 'means you consistently don't win anything in the underage groups and that means you can't win anything at senior level,' Pearce told the Guardian.

Pearce pointed out that before the game against Ecuador Barkley had played less than 90 minutes for England this season.

'Does that mean he's had great experience sitting in the stands or does it mean that he's missed six or seven Under 21 qualifiers and the experience of international football? I know where I'd have left him,' said Pearce.

There is a growing clamour for Hodgson to select England's rising stars over the likes of Wayne Rooney for the opening game against Italy in Manaus on June 14. To Barkley's advocates Pearce's comments could be seen as having a whiff about them of Alan Hansen's infamous assertion that 'you don't win anything with kids' before Manchester United's Class of 92 went on to dominate English football.

But Pearce cited Spain and France as the models of success which England should follow. Both countries won major international age-group tournaments before going on to World Cup and European Championship glory.

Pearce was also critical of Hodgson's selection of Shaw, the 19-year-old Southampton left-back chosen for Brazil over Ashley Cole, whose international career is now over after amassing 107 caps.

'Shaw has had a very good season but I personally would have taken Ashley Cole,' he said.
