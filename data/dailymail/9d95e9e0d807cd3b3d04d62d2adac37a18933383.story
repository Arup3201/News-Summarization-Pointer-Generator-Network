Dogs stolen: Walter, 40, and Gemma Clay, 32, with their daughters Isabel, seven, and Robyn, one

A family of four have been left devastated after five of their dogs were stolen from their garden, with one of them on the verge of having a litter.

Sisters Isabel, seven, and Robyn Clay, one, are upset after their pets were snatched in the night from their home near Bradford, West Yorkshire.

Bella the Jack Russell, who is due to give birth to a litter today, was among the five bitches stolen in the raid, leaving the family distraught.

Others taken included Schnauzer dogs Sugar and Mathilda, and Jack Russells Tiny and Ruby.

The family are appealing for the thieves to hand themselves in after the pets were discovered missing from their kennels last week.

Mother Gemma Clay, 32, said: ‘My daughters are devastated. They spend so much time with the dogs around the farm. They are really into them and can’t bear to be without them.

‘Isabel is gutted. She was beside herself when I picked her up from school and told her. She can’t understand why it happened. She keeps asking why bad men would be so cruel.’

The registered dog breeder added: ‘My one-year-old Robyn is also devastated. I don’t think she quite understands what happened.

‘She sits and plays with them all the time in the kitchen so to be without them is upsetting for her. She can’t talk properly yet but just keeps saying “woof, woof”, hoping they’ll answer.’

Mrs Clay, whose husband Walter, 40, is a full-time farmer, said the theft came to light when they found the kennels had been broken into and the canines’ beds empty on Thursday morning.

Concern: The family are particularly worried about Sugar, four, as she had recently had a litter or her own

She explained: ‘Walter had been working late the night before and everything seemed fine. But when he was out early the next morning he saw they were gone.

‘We have a back building where the dogs stay and one of the panels was missing. He thought it was just the wind, but when we both looked we saw someone had barged through three doors and taken our five girls.

‘Our other Jack Russell, Stanley, was running round wondering where his friends were. We are most concerned about Bella as she is about to give birth any day now, and you can see by looking at her swollen belly. I’m just heartbroken that someone would take a dog when she’s so vulnerable.

‘I don’t tell many people about our dogs because I know they’re valuable - I’ve been very careful about it in the past. Despite their value, they are all just lovely little dogs and so sweet-natured.

'They love our girls to bits. They are all micro-chipped too. That’s probably why we didn’t hear them when they were taken - with our dogs no visitor is unwanted so they wouldn’t have put up a protest.’

Jack Russell pups can fetch £350 while miniature Schnauzers are worth £800. Bella has been described as a tan and white Jack Russell aged four, while Ruby is a rough-coated black and white  dog aged three of the same breed.

The missing Schnauzers are Mathilda, four, who is grey, and four-year-old Sugar who has a fluffy white coat. Mrs Clay said they were also particularly worried about Sugar as she had recently had a litter of her own.

She added: ‘We just want to make life as awkward as possible for whoever is responsible by letting them know how heartbroken we are - especially Isabel and Robyn. They just want their friends back safe on the farm.’

Sergeant James Firth, of West Yorkshire Police, said: ‘We would urge anyone with information about this offence or the whereabouts of any of the stolen dogs to call us.’
