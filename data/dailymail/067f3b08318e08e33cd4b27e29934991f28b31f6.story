Dani Alvas has slammed Fifa's decision to stop Barcelona unveiling new forward Luis Suarez following his £75m move from Liverpool.

The Uruguay international was handed a four-month global ban by Fifa after biting Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup, and Fifa have confirmed any public unveiling will not be permitted while the ban remains in force.

'That he can’t even be unveiled is very strange,' Alves told AS. 'There have been worse actions that have gone unpunished. His was a sudden action in the heat of the moment.

'It’s a luxury for Barca to have him here,' Alves added.

Suarez
 is due to complete his move from Liverpool in the next few days, and 
the Catalan club has previously introduced star signings including 
Neymar and Cesc Fabregas to packed stadiums.

There
 have been suggestions Barcelona could hold a similar event for Suarez 
in a non-football venue to get around the four-month ban imposed on the 
Uruguay striker for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini, but FIFA has 
confirmed that any such event will not be allowed.

FIFA's head of media Delia Fischer said: 'The ban relates to all football-related activity. He cannot be in a football-related public event irrespective of the venue.

'He cannot even be involved in a football-related charity event.'

Suarez, 27, had his appeal against the four-month ban, plus a nine-match international and an 100,000 Swiss franc (£66,000) fine, rejected outright by FIFA's appeals committee.

He is expected to take his appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in a final bid to reduce the sanctions that, as they stand, will keep him out of club football until the end of October.

Number nine: They might not be able to unveil him but Barcelona fans can already buy Suarez's shirt

Different: Neymar and Cesc Fabregas both underwent high profile unveilings at the Nou Camp

Suarez can also ask CAS to put his ban on hold pending their final decision but that would risk him missing more matches rather than a chunk of the close season if the court upholds the sanctions.

Some 90,000 packed the Nou Camp stadium for the unveiling of Brazil forward Neymar in June 2013.

FIFA's original ban took into account that Suarez had shown no remorse for the biting incident, his third such attack in less than four years.

The player then did issue an official apology but it did not lead to any change of mind by the FIFA appeals panel.

Suarez's lawyer on Friday claimed the punishment was 'blatantly draconian, totalitarian and fascist'.

Alejandro Balbi told Spanish radio station Cope: 'The right of a footballer to work is being violated, and football should be worried about that.

'The nine (international) games may seem excessive, but the fact that he can't watch a game of football, or train or carry out his job, we are talking about unpleasant things.'
