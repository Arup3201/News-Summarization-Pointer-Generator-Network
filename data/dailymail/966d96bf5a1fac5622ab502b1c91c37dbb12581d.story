Famed NFL coach Mike Ditka has revealed that his biggest regret was deciding not to run against Barack Obama for the open Illinois Senate seat in 2004.

'Biggest mistake I’ve ever made. Not that I would have won, but I probably would have and he wouldn’t be in the White House,' Ditka said at a recent event.

Ditka is a legend in the state as he was a player for the Chicago Bears football team during their 1963 championship season and then came back to coach the team, leading them to their most recent championship as coach in 1986.

Putting their differences aside: President Obama hosted the 1985 Bears team, which Mike Ditka coached, to the White House in 2011 since they did not get their original ceremony in 1986 due to the Challenger explosion

In 2004, Republican Senator Peter Fitzgerald left the federal government and Jack Ryan was seen as the GOP front runner for much of the campaign.

CNN reports that Ryan ended up dropping out with little time left in the race after legal papers revealed that he and his ex-wife went to sex clubs and he asked her to perform sex acts in front of other patrons.

Ryan subsequently dropped out of the race and the local Republican political machine called on Ditka to run.

'He’s enormously popular. I think if he gets in, he immediately becomes a favorite,' then-Democratic nominee Obama said at the time, according to The Daily News.

Ditka's high approval ratings along with his self-described 'ultra-ultra-ultra conservative' political leanings would have made him an ideal candidate for the party, but he decided against it.

Citing his wife's disapproval of a run and his business obligations, Ditka formally announced that he would not be the Republican candidate just four months before the election.

His biggest regret: Ditka was pushed by the local Republican machine in 2004 to run against virtual unknown Barack Obama for the open Senate seat in Illinois but in July he announced that he would not run (pictured)

That same month, Obama gave the keynote address at the Democratic National Convetion where John Kerry was formally nominated as the party's presidential candidate.

The speech was well received, launching him onto the national politcal scene and helping secure his landslide victory against his Republican challenger, former Ambassador Alan Keyes.

One term later, Obama was elected President, and four years after that he was re-elected, bringing us back to present day.

Now, while attending an oil field opening ceremony in North Dakota, Ditka lamented on his decision though he still seems fairly content with the life he has.

'If somebody would have told me 40 years ago they’d pay you to be on TV, I would have said "You’re crazy,"' Ditka said according to The Dickinson Press.

Well-versed: Ditka is one of two people in NFL history to win a title as a player, assistant coach, and head coach (seen at left in 1963 and at right in 1982 as coach)

'They pay me to be on TV and talk about something I like to talk about, football. That’s almost insane.'

The two men have clearly put their 
differences aside since Ditka had some kind words for the President when
he honored the 1985 Bears team at the White House in 2011. They were 
initially supposed to have a ceremony in the year after their victory, 
but the Challenger space shuttle explosion cancelled those plans.

'On
behalf of the 1985 Chicago Bears, we consider him one of us. We're very
proud that you honored us by bringing us here. It's only 26 years after
the fact, and five administrations, but thank you,' Ditka said at the 
ceremony, according to ESPN..
