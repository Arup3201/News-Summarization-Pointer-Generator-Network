Wireless company T-Mobile billed customers for bogus charges for years, making hundreds of millions, the Federal Trade Commission alleged Tuesday.

In a federal complaint filed in Seattle, the FTC claimed T-Mobile billed consumers for subscriptions to premium text services such as $9.99 horoscopes and celebrity gossip that were never authorized by account holders.

In trouble: T-Mobile knowingly made hundreds of millions off its customers in bogus third-party charges and billed them for premium services that customers never authorized

The practice is often referred to as 
'cramming':  businesses stuff a customer's bill with bogus charges 
associated with a third party.

'T-Mobile’s practices have caused consumers millions of dollars of injury,' the FTC said in in the complaint.

In this case, the FTC says T-Mobile 
should have realized that many of these premium text services were scams
 because of the high rate of customer complaints.

The FTC also claimed T-Mobile collected 35 to 40 percent of the charges - even after customers said they were being scammed.

'It's wrong for a company like T-Mobile to profit from scams against its customers when there were clear warning signs the charges it was imposing were fraudulent,' FTC Chair Edith Ramirez said in an agency release. 'The FTC's goal is to ensure that T-Mobile repays all its customers for these crammed charges.'

Protection: The FTC said one way for consumers to try to prevent fraudulent charges is to ask their providers to block all third-party businesses from providing services on their phones

In addition to billing customers for third-party services, T-Mobile allegedly lists them 'in the middle or towards the end of the bill,
 which in some cases may exceed 50 pages in length,' the agency alleged.

The FTC said one way for consumers to try to prevent fraudulent charges is to ask their providers to block all third-party businesses from providing services on their phones.

T-Mobile's CEO John Legere responded to the FTC's complaint in a statement Tuesday, calling it 'unfounded and without merit' and a 'sensationalized legal action.'

'T-Mobile stopped billing for these Premium SMS services last year and launched a proactive program to provide full refunds for any customer that feels that they were charged for something they did not want,' Legere said. 'T-Mobile is fighting harder than any of the carriers to change the way the wireless industry operates and we are disappointed that the FTC has chosen to file this action against the most pro-consumer company in the industry rather than the real bad actors.'

Legere also said '[third-party providers] should be held accountable, and the FTC’s lawsuit seeking to hold T-Mobile responsible for their acts is not only factually and legally unfounded, but also misdirected.'

Headquartered in Bellevue, Washington, T-Mobile USA, Inc., is a publicly traded company. According to its website, Deutsche Telekom AG maintains a 67 percent ownership in the company's common stock.
