This is the heartbreaking moment a baby rhino had to be rescued by an animal welfare group after he was found crying over his mother's dead body.

The three-month-old rhino was left orphaned after poachers killed his mother for her horn.

Staff from the animal welfare group Hoedspruit Endangered Species Centre, from Pretoria, South Africa said the young rhino was found crying and would not leave his mother's side.

Vets had to undertake the careful task of
 darting the baby so he could be carefully transported to the HESC 
centre, otherwise without a mother in the wild he would die.

Staff then worked through the night to assess the baby for any injury and help him get used to his new environment.

He was also placed with a surrogate mother to try and console him and has found comfort with his human keeper, Christo Schreiber.

Christo, from the HESC, said: 'Despite his distress, he had a good night spent in close contact.

'He was in a calmer state in the morning. The hunt now begins for fat-free milk to sustain him.'

The HESC specialise in helping injured or orphaned animals across South Africa

The HESC specialise in helping injured or orphaned animals across South Africa, and they hope they will be able to rehabilitate the baby rhino back into the wild in due course.

MailOnline reported last week how poignant footage had captured the baby rhino seeking solace from his keeper.

The rhino, called Gertjie, can be seen nuzzling a female member of staff at the centre with his nose.

Traumatic: Staff at the Hoedspruit Endangered Species Centre said it was a devastating sight finding the tiny animal, as he wouldn't leave his mother's side and was 'crying inconsolably' for her

Centre of attention: Staff take it in turns to feed him every three hours and stay with him in his enclosure as he is scared of sleeping alone

In a bid to
 get closer to her, the thick-skinned creature rolls down on to the 
floor and affectionately lays his head on her lap.

Apparently the infant rhino is scared of sleeping alone and will only rest when someone is near him.

Gertjie was rescued from the wild on May 7 after being found next to his dead mother.
