Ludogorets Razgrad must play Real Madrid in their Champions League  home debut with a stadium section closed because of fans’ racist behavior.

UEFA announced that its disciplinary panel imposed sanctions after incidents that occurred during Ludogorets elimination of Steaua Bucharest in a play-off last week.

Steaua was also punished for fans' racist behavior, for the second time this season, and must play a Europa League match in an empty stadium.

UEFA did not specify details of the racist incidents.

Ludogorets are making their first appearance in the competition in a group that also features Liverpool and Basel. 

The Bulgarian champions host Real Madrid on October 1 in the National Stadium, Sofia, because their own ground does not meet UEFA standards.

UEFA fined Ludogorets 16,000 euros (£12,709) for offences including fans invading the field and the team receiving at least five yellow cards.

Meanwhile, Steaua were fined 64,500 euros (£51,235) for the racism and other offenses.

Last month, the 1986 European Cup winners were forced to close two stadium sections in a third qualifying round, second-leg match. It followed racist incidents in the previous round against Stromsgodset of Norway.

UEFA operates an escalating scale of sanctions with further racism incidents provoking full stadium closures, leading to possible disqualification from competitions.

'All forms of racist behavior are considered serious offences against the disciplinary regulations and are punished with the most severe sanctions,' UEFA said.
