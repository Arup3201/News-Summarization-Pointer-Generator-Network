You probably wouldn't catch Kate Moss and Cara Delevingne tucking into a packet of crisps before a catwalk show but one food artist has shown what the supermodels would look like with a few extra carbs in their diet.

Jacob's, the purveyor of Mini Cheddars, Twiglets and Cream Crackers, called on Nathan Wyburn to conjure up some of Britain's most famous faces - including the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - in crisp form.

Complete with hilarious names - such as Twiggy-let (Sixties model Twiggy), Crackers Delevingne and Cheddar Cole (X Factor judge Cheryl to you and I) - the salty creations are crackers.

The models are joined by Harry 'Minicheddar' Styles and Twiggy Stardust (a.k.a David Bowie).

Food artist Nathan, 24, who showcased the stencil artworks at a one-off exhibition in London earlier this week, also re-created Stonehenge, Windsor Castle and the London Eye in crisp form.

Nathan, from Cardiff, used a staggering - and calorific - 12,000 Twiglets, 54kg of Cream Crackers and over 10kg of Mini Cheddars to create the snack creations.
