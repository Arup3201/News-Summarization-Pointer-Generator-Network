An elderly woman in Alberta, Canada was helpless early this month as mice crawled onto her body and began gnawing at her face.

The unnamed resident of St. Therese Villa assisted living in Lethbridge is both physically disabled and suffers from dementia and was unable to stop the mice, which drew blood.

Now the woman is on medication to fend off infection and Canada elderly advocates are raising the alarm in order that such a thing never happens again.

Appalling: A physically and mentally disabled patient of a Canada elderly care facility was unable to fend off mice that were found gnawing at her face September 1

The group Friends of Medicare told the Canada Press that the shocking event occurred September 1.

'We found out that last Sunday,' said the group's executive director Sandra Azocar. 'One of the staff of that facility walked into this resident’s room and found mice nibbling on her face.'

Azocar told the Edmonton Journal that the facility has a serious mouse problem and also struggles with a bedbug infestation.

'The whole facility has a mice situation. Mice don’t usually come out unless there’s an infestation. They like to hide from humans,' she said. 'This is so unbelievable that this would be happening in Canada’s richest province, that our seniors are having to live under these conditions.'

'Beyond belief': Advocate for elderly care Sandra Azocar called the incident 'beyond reprehensible' and 'utterly appalling' as her group Friends of Medicare spread word of the incident this week

'There is no excuse for this to be happening in Alberta. Absolutely none.'

Azocar said the victim is doing as can be expected.

'She’s doing okay. Emotionally it impacted her and she’s on medication to prevent infection.'

The facility sits next to expansive farmland at the edge of town and as harvest season begins, the rodents are displaced from their normal homes in fields by machinery.

But in addition to that, Azocar blames insufficient resources.

Creepy: The mice even drew blood and a nest of them was found in the woman's closet. 'She¿s doing okay. Emotionally it impacted her and she¿s on medication to prevent infection.' said Azocar

'How do you do your job when you can’t be everywhere during your shift,' she asked. 'It’s not sufficient. It’s a bigger problem than just the mice. It’s a systemic issue. '

Sheli Murphy, vice-president of rural operations for Covenant Health, which oversees the facility, says the problem is being addressed.

'Now, I do not believe there is a mouse in the building,' she said. 'Any concern when we hear of people that we care for being harmed while they’re in our care is very disturbing. We do need to take those opportunities to investigate and ensure that we can learn from them, regardless of what the incident is.'
