This burger is so hot that it comes to your table on fire... and  you have to sign a waiver before attempting to eat it. 

Made from a slab of beef infused with ghost and cayenne peppers, and pure chili extract, with  relish of habaneros and jalapenos, and serrano peppers, the entire thing is then smothered in Hellfire Sauce and a splash of grain alcohol.

The sizzling Hellfire Burger is the creation of Loren Gingrich, owner of Xtreme Smokehouse and Grill in Washington, Iowa.

The Hellfire Burger contains six types of chilli and is set alight before being served to diners at Xtreme Smokehouse and Grill in Washington, Iowa

It's so hot that Mr Gingrich has asked the Guinness Book of Records to create a new category for it.

Reportedly clocking in around 1,000,000 Scoville units (about half the burn of pepper spray), customers have to be over 18 to order the meal.

The burger arrives at the table with protective gloves, eyeswear and a waiver, which mentions the possible loss of life.

'We actually have a ghost burger,' said Mr Gingrich said to kcrg.com. 'We wanted to do something that was hotter.

The relish is Mr Gingrich's own recipe and contains three types of chillies; habaneros and jalapenos, and serrano peppers. 

A single jalapeno pepper rates between 2,500 and 5,000 on the Scoville unit. 

Another three types of chillies are then added to the burger - ghost peppers, cayenne peppers and pure chilli extract, all of which are infused in the meat. 

The burger is then assembled before being generously doused with a ring of hot condiment, Hellfire Sauce. 

The final touch is a splash of grain alcohol before the entire snack is set on fire before being served to diners.
