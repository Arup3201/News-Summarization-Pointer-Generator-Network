In the days before the Olympic podium it was the title belt given to the Usain Bolt of the late 19th century.

The Grand Challenge Belt awarded in 1886 was actually silver rather than the now traditional gold -  but it was given to the fastest man in the world over 120 yards.

The grand belt, complete with a Union Jack flag and detailed inscriptions, was handed to the winner of the 120 yard sprint at the event which took place a decade before the first modern day Olympiad in 1896.

The belt of champions: The Grand Challenge Belt of Australasia was awarded to the winner of the 1886 120-yard sprint

The 120 yard sprint was a version of the modern day 100m race in the days before the Olympics were held.

The historic belt is now set to fetched tens of thousands of pounds when it goes under the hammer next month.

The Grand Challenge Belt of Australasia, made from silver, was won by W. Clarke on November 13 1886 and now belongs to Malcolm Clarke Baden, 71, after being passed down through generations of the family.

The belt was awarded to crown the world's fastest men a decade before the first modern day Olympiad

Malcolm, from Burton-on-Trent, Staffs, said: 'A family member emigrated to Australia many, many years ago and the belt was won by one of my relatives in 1886.

'It belt was eventually bought back to the UK by one of my uncles and it has always been in our family ever since.

'A little bit of history has been lost along the way and there seems to be no real way to find out more about it only that it was won before the Olympics as we know them began.

'The actual race was the equivalent of the 100m today - but I doubt they were quite as fast as Usain Bolt.

'It was left to me by my father and I have had it for around 15 years now, so it’s about time for a collector who can really find out more about it to look after it.

'I took it to a television auction show when it came to town a few years ago who said it was worth £10,000 but to a collector it could be £100,000 - there is a lot of history here.

'I’m sure some Australians would love to get their hands on some extra silverware after finishing so far behind us at the Olympics.'

The Grand Challenge Belt of Australasia is being sold as part of a three day fine art and antique sale from 19-21 September at Bamfords Auction in Derby.

Bamfords Auctioneer Steven Iredale said: 'It’s difficult to understand why so little has been recorded about such a big event like this.

'We’ve been unable to uncover much information at all which is unusual for something that has such fantastic collectors value attached to it.

Valuable: Experts say the 120-year-old belt could be worth tens of thousands of pounds when it goes under the hammer next month

'The race was basically what is now known as the 100m race at the modern Olympics.

'These athletic meetings preceded what we now call the Olympics, this event taking place 10 years before the first games but there could have been many more before.

'We expect the belt to be snapped up for somewhere between at least £6,000 to £10,000 but it could be much more.

'It’s something very rare which will hardly ever come up at auction again so would mean a great deal to many collectors around the world.'
