A woman who was served ‘raw’ chicken when she visited McDonald’s for the first time in nearly two years says she will never dine at the fast food chain again.

Describing the moment she took 'two huge mouthfuls' of the wrap because she was starving, Gizela Tahuri told Daily Mail Australia: 'I thought this is really really soft and pulled out the chicken strip inside and I thought “oh my god that is actually raw”.' 

The shocked personal trainer posted a disgusting image online of the uncooked chicken she found inside her McWrap when she visited a McDonald’s store at Deception Bay, a suburb 32 kilometres north of Brisbane, in Queensland.

‘So much for healthy choices McDonald's when you serve RAW chicken. I haven't eaten McDonalds for nearly 2 years and now I know why. Mmm I'm not loving it,’ she wrote on Facebook.

'So much for healthy choices': Gizela Tahuri bit into this raw chicken at a McDonald's store in Queensland

After the experience made her feel ‘really queasy sick’ she vowed that she won’t eat McDonald’s again: ‘I definitely wouldn’t eat there, I would make sure I have food in my bag.’

Tahuri, a personal trainer from Brisbane, usually avoids eating McDonald’s but caved in because she was on holiday and en route to visit her mum’s house.

‘I have two kids and thought we’d go just for a treat and I was raving hungry. The only thing I could eat was from healthy choices menu and I get sick if I don’t eat,’ Tahuri said. ‘As a PT I can’t be seen eating a Big Mac and I can’t stomach that anymore,’ she added.

Tahuri, 32, first noticed something was wrong when they got to her mum’s house and took two large bites.

‘Luckily I didn’t catch anything or fall sick.’

The mother of two who runs her own business PT Giz said that while her children, aged 6 and 8, are fans of the chain she will now ‘double check the food each time’ before handing them any burgers. ‘I’m a bit hesitant,’ she added.

Tahuri says she did not have time to go back to McDonald’s and complain because she had to go straight to work.

She believes the raw food was ‘an isolated incident’. But warned: ‘I really hope it doesn’t happen to anyone else, especially pregnant ladies.’

A McDonald’s spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia: ‘We are disappointed that this has happened.

'We take food safety very seriously and have strict processes and systems in place. An investigation is currently underway with the restaurant, and we encourage the customer to contact us to help us to investigate fully.'

The chicken McWrap is advertised as boasting 'a strip of succulent, marinated and crumbed chicken'. It is accompanied by 'fresh Australian lettuce and creamy mayonnaise' and is 'carefully' hand wrapped in a tortilla.

McDonald's have promised to investigate 'fully' what happened at the store in Deception Bay
