A dodo looks forlornly from within its glass cage while a dinosaur skull sits menacingly on a pole - both surveying a room filled with fellow casualties of extinction, as well as endangered species.

The flightless bird met its doom in the 17th century - and the fearsome Chasmosaurus belli died out around 150million years ago.

They form part of a new exhibition - called Extinction: Not The End Of The World? - at the Natural History Museum in south-west London.

But the purpose of the display, which opens on Saturday, is to take you beyond the dodos and dinosaurs to discover species that prospered in the wake of others’ demise.

In other words, the message is: extinction is not always a bad thing.

Take the Irish elk, for example. The magnificent creature - whose 4m antlers are on display - once roamed grasslands from Ireland to Siberia, and died out around 10,000 years ago.

However, its extinction has been credited with benefiting rival species, by giving them better access to food - and potential mates.

And, of course, when the dinosaurs were wiped out 65million years ago, it led to the rise of mammals, including, ultimately, us.

More than 99 per cent of species that 
once roamed our planet are now extinct, yet a diverse range of plants 
and animals have survived. 

Some, such as the leatherback turtle and common shrew, have lived on through several mass extinction events.

Alex Fairhead, exhibition developer at 
the Natural History Museum, said: ‘Usually people only ever think of 
dinosaurs and dodos when they talk about extinction.

'Here, visitors will discover the positive side to 
extinction and that the animals and plants we see today would not have 
survived if others had not first become extinct.

'There will also be 
opportunities to discuss modern conservation, see the conservation 
successes and failures, and consider whether we're now on the verge of 
the next mass extinction.’

The exhibition brings together more than 
80 specimens to guide visitors on a journey through death and 
destruction, demonstrating the crucial role that extinction plays in the
evolution of life.

Among them is a reconstructed great 
auk, a waterbird that once swam in groups of hundreds of thousands of 
birds in the North Atlantic, but can be found only in museums today.

Also on display is the Coelacanth. The 'living fossil' fish is commonly 
regarded as having evolved little from prehistoric times and was thought
to be extinct until a living specimen was discovered in 1938 off the 
coast of southern Africa.

Not the End of the World? also examines the plight of today's endangered 
species, such as the tiger and orang-utan.

Scientists are fighting what some 
consider a losing battle to save animals such as the bluefin tuna - illustrated in the museum with the fish suspended above a giant food can - and 
the kakapo parrot.

'Extinction is a natural part of life on 
Earth – it’s shaped and continues to shape the biodiversity that exists 
on the planet,' said Museum mammals curator Roberto Portela Miguez.

‘Many scientists study the role that extinction plays in the evolution 
of life. Specimens of extinct species like those in our collections and 
on display in the exhibition hold the key to our better understanding of
their demise and how life goes on.

'Research on them highlights the 
important value of museum collections.’

And the question remains: should we intervene in extinction or 
just let nature take its course?Not The End Of The World? runs from Feb 8 to Sep 8. 10am to 5.50pm. Admission: Adult £9, child and concession £4.50, family £24.
