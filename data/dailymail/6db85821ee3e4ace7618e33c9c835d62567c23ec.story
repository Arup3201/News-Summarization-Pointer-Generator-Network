Sentenced: Jill Marshall was jailed for 18 months for stealing £50,000 from Gulliver's Kingdom theme park in Derbyshire

A theme park cashier has been jailed after stealing £50,000 of takings - which she used to fund shopping sprees and lavish holidays.

Jill Marshall, 54, stole the cash from Gulliver's Kingdom where she had worked in the ticket office for 20 years.

Park bosses became suspicious when Marshall was caught with wads of cash in her handbag and her till did not add up.

She was finally caught on CCTV not issuing a ticket to every customer and pocketing their entrance fee instead.

Marshall was sentenced to 18 months in prison after pleading guilty to fraud by false representation at Derby Crown Court.

She was also given six months to repay the money she stole.

Sentencing her, Judge David Pugsley said: 'You have lived a useful, caring, kindly life but you stole in a position of trust and that sort of behaviour will not be tolerated.'

The court heard how an 18 month-long investigation was launched by police and staff at the attraction in Matlock bath, Derbyshire, who painstakingly went through nine years of receipts.

They found that Marshall, of Wirksworth, Derbyshire, had stolen £50,000 - the equivalent of 3,134 adult admissions at £15.95 - between 2004 and 2010.

Justin Wigoder, prosecuting, said that Marshall was regarded as a 'trustworthy and reliable' employee by park bosses.

But despite CCTV being installed in her office, Marshall still brazenly hid tickets behind the counter and pocketed money.

He said: 'On one day, she took £600. The scope and scale of the theft can be seen as a broad picture.'

He told the court she spent some of the money on a holiday in the Maldives and shopping trips to designer outlets in Cornwall.

Defending Marshall, Sonal Ahya said that she spent some of the cash on family gifts and that she is 'truly, truly sorry'.

She added: 'She put herself in this position but has demonstrated a degree of regret by acknowledging guilt.'

Detective Constable Kevin Rivington, from Derbyshire Police, said after the sentencing: 'The discovery of this fraud was understandably very upsetting for the family who run Gulliver's.

'Marshall had worked there for more than 20 years and was a respected, trusted and much-liked employee.

'The staff at Gulliver's have been very supportive of our investigation and have helped us at every opportunity.

'I hope this sentencing gives them some form of closure so they can move on.'

The theme park describes itself as a family-run attraction for families with children aged between two and 13 years of age.

The company also has attractions in Warrington, Cheshire, and Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire.
