When Breanna and Kevin Fleischman conceived their first child, they spent months researching the best doctor.

But they had no idea that their final choice had already played a pivotal role in both their lives.

Dr Barrie May, of Saddleback Memorial Medical Center in Orange County, Los Angeles, delivered Kevin in 1984 - and Breanna in 1986.

On Tuesday, he delivered the 10,437th baby of his career: their son Maverick.

Shocked! Kevin and Breanna Fleischman, pictured with their first son Maverick, had no idea they were delivered by the same doctor in Orange County, Los Angeles, that they picked to deliver their first-born

Rare: Dr Barrie May of Saddleback Medical Center has delivered more than 10,000 babies but this is a first

The couple didn't meet until high school, and married nine years later.

Despite growing up a mile apart, they weren't quite aware how closely-entangled their lives were.

Breanna, 28, told KTLA 5: 'I told my mother-in-law, we've got Dr May and she said "oh he delivered Kevin as well!" That's a little crazy.'

It was also a career first for Dr May, who has worked for 46 years but never delivered a mom, dad, and son.

Career first: The couple said Dr May was incredibly supportive throughout the pregnancy and the birth

'It's literally a full circle,' Dr May told KTLA 5.

'Kevin told me, "oh by the way you delivered my wife." I've had that happen a number of times.

'But then, "oh by the way you delivered me too." And that was a first.'

And Kevin, 30, said they are already thinking of a second.

'As long as he's sticking around and practising then you know, maybe it'll be 11,000+ by then. We'll see.'
