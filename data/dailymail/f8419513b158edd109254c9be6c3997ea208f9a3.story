At least 89 people have been killed in one of Afghanistan's deadliest suicide attacks since British and U.S. troops invaded in 2001.

A bomber detonated a car packed with explosives this morning, destroying more than 20 shops and dozens of cars, hitting a mosque and leaving victims buried in heaps of rubble.

An official said the blast, in a small undefended town 150 miles south of Kabul near the border with Pakistan, also wounded at least 42 people - all civilians.

Horror: A suicide bomb attack has killed at least 89 people near a busy market in eastern Afghanistan

Rubble: The suicide bomber detonated the device near a police checkpoint in Paktika province

Injured: A wounded man is stretchered into hospital for treatment after the devastating blast

The official, Mohammad Reza Kharoti, said: 'It was a very brutal suicide attack against poor civilians. There was no military base nearby.'Â 

The death toll was originally put at lower than 40, but so many victims were buried in rubble that it more than doubled within a few hours.

No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.

The Taliban sent a statement to media denying their insurgent group was involved in the Paktika bombing and saying they 'strongly condemn attacks on local people.'

Defence Ministry spokesman General Mohammad Zahir Azimi said the bomber detonated his vehicle as he drove by the remote town's crowded market.

The military was providing helicopters and ambulances to transport the victims to the provincial capital, Sharan.

At least 42 wounded have been moved to hospitals there, said General Azimi, adding that the explosion destroyed more than 20 shops and dozens of vehicles.

Carnage: Cars, trucks and tractors were left mangled by the blast, for which the Taliban denied responsibility

Destruction: Locals were left to pick over the rubble with diggers in the small town, which had no Army base

Stretcher: One man wounded in the attack is moved to hospital. The worst-injured were taken by helicopter

The bombing happened just three days after deal was struck between Afghanistan's two presidential contenders in a bid to avert a dangerous rift in Afghanistan's democracy.

Saturday's deal was brokered by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and involved former Finance Minister Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai and former Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah.

The pair were agreeing on an audit of last month's contested presidential run-off vote.

Unofficial and disputed results showed Ghani-Ahmadzai well in the lead, but supporters of Abdullah say that's only because of widespread fraud.

Since fraud was alleged on both sides, the deal provides that every one of the 8million ballots will be audited under national and international supervision over the next three or four weeks.

Neither the election nor the weekend deal have had any visible impact on the security situation in the country, which sees near-daily attacks.

Aftermath: The death toll was originally put at lower than 40, but many victims were buried in rubble

Hospital: Doctors tend to the wounded in a crowded hospital near the site of the blast this morning

Injuries: Lying on a blood-stained hospital bed, a wounded man has a dressing applied to his leg

An official said the blast, in the small Urgun district near the border with Pakistan, also wounded at least 42

This morning's blast took place hours 
after a roadside bomb ripped through a minivan carrying employees of the
 presidential palace in eastern Kabul, killing two passengers.

Seven government employees were on board, all of them from the palace's media office, said Kabul police chief Gul Agha Hashimi.

The explosion also wounded five other people inside the minivan, including the driver.

Mr Hashimi, speaking to reporters at the site of the blast, added: 'One passenger survived unharmed.'

Kabul police spokesman Hashmat Stanikzai said the minivan bomb was a remotely detonated device planted along a main road.

First blast: A bombing hit a minibus carrying several government media workers earlier today, killing two

Toll: The scene of the attack in Kabul. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the blast as violence escalates

Timing: The blast came just three days after a deal brokered by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (left) between presidential contenders  Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai and Abdullah Abdullah

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid claimed responsibility for that attack in a statement sent to reporters.

Roadside bombings are a major threat to both Afghan security forces and civilians across the country.

Such attacks have escalated as the Taliban intensify their campaign ahead of the withdrawal of foreign troops.

Western
 forces, most of them from the U.S., are due to leave the country by the
 end of this year - prompting fears the nation will descend into a 
crisis similar to that in Iraq.
