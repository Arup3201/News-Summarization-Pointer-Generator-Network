Passed over: Lady Sarah Carnegie, pictured, was unable to prevent her father's earldom passing on to a relative he never met

The daughters of one of Britain’s oldest aristocratic families missed out on their father’s title after it was claimed by a distant relative.

The three children of David Carnegie, the 14th Earl of Northesk, tried to block attempts at inheritance by his eighth cousin once removed, Patrick Carnegy.

The late earl, who sat as a Scottish Conservative peer in the House of Lords, died in 2010, but details of the struggle over his title had remained secret until now.

Representatives of his daughters, Lady Sarah Carnegie, 30, Lady Fiona Carnegie, 26, and Lady Sophie Carnegie, 23, tried to persuade the Crown Office to pass the title on down the female line instead, according to The Sunday Times.

The inheritance is one of the most extreme examples of the UK’s inheritance law for titles, which always favours male relatives over females.

In this case, the present earl was able to inherit despite having to trace his inheritance back 349 years, eight years before the earldom was created.

The laws have recently been changed for the Royal family, but no reforms have been made for other nobility, many of whom are pushing for change.

The struggle over to whom the title should pass was based on the interpretation of a Latin document from 1666 which created the earldom.

A possible meaning of the document was that the title could pass to whomever inherited the late earl’s property – in this case Lady Sarah.

But the Crown Office was unable to resolve the dispute before the 15th earl had his application for a coat of arms approved by the Lord Lyon, who controls membership of the Scottish nobility.

His title was confirmed on August 15 2010.

The 15th earl, Patrick Carnegy, is a 72-year-old scholar who is an expert on the works of Wagner and Shakespeare. He never met the earl whose title he inherited.

He was unmarried when he inherited, but now lives with his wife, opera singer Jill Gomez.

The unusual path of inheritance is the latest twist in an often painful history for the family.

David Carnegie’s eldest son, who would have inherited had he lived, killed himself in 2001.

Alexander Carnegie, known as Lord Rosehill, shot himself with his father’s at his family home in Hampshire while on leave from a psychiatric hospital.

The 14th earl died of cancer aged 55 in 2010, and did not live to see his daughter, a paramedic, marry Anthony Caporaso, an American.

The couple had a son, Jamie, before divorcing. All three daughters now live in America.

However, members of the family have said that the title is not a great loss because of  its association with family tragedies.

Lady Fisher, the aunt of Lady Sarah and her sisters, said: ‘I think we took the collective view that there were so many sadnesses attached to it and it had no benefits.

‘There is no money or estate with the title — it is just an adornment. There isn't a stately home and there isn't much money.’

However, the inheritance did bring with it something of value. The Balmerino pearls, a family heirloom, passed between the Countesses of Northesk, and, now that the current earl is married, will pass to his wife from the late earl’s widow.

The present earl has admitted that the circumstances of his inheritance were ‘embarrassing’, but said the considered it ‘a matter of history and respect to the distinction of my ancestors.’
