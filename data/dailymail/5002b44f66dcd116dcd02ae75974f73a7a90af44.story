In Washington D.C. on Tuesday evening, Wilfried Zaha will step out for a 45-minute appearance that may define his future as a Manchester United player.

Increasingly it appears that his time at Old Trafford is on a knife-edge. If Zaha flops and shows the same lack of interest some feel he has displayed off the field since joining last summer, the opportunity to wear the red shirt may not come again.

However, against Inter Milan, Louis van Gaal will at least hand Zaha the chance to resuscitate his United career.

He will play the second half and be 
expected to show flashes of the considerable talent that persuaded Sir 
Alex Ferguson to spend £15million to make him his final signing as 
United manager.

Already, though, Zaha is on the back foot. In a press conference in the early hours of Tuesday morning, Van Gaal made it clear that his new 3-5-2 system could restrict the 21-year-old’s role at the club, depriving Zaha of the freedom to play in his favoured position on the wing, where as a Crystal Palace player he dazzled with his dazzling step-overs and blistering pace.  

It was this creativity that persuaded Palace supporters to place a gigantic post on London’s south circular with the words ‘He’s just too good for you’.

Zaha’s performances in that final season, catapulting his local team into the top-flight, will live long in the memory at Selhurst Park.

At Old Trafford, though, Zaha is starting from scratch, having to prove himself all over again.

Dressing down: David Moyes and Zaha did not see eye-to-eye during the Scotsman's time at United

'He will have to play as a striker as 
he can’t play the other positions in the system,’ Van Gaal said. 'Ashley
 Young can play as a wing-back. Zaha cannot do that so he will be a 
striker.’

At United last 
season, the consensus was that Zaha simply could not get his head round 
the defensive responsibilities. There was concern that he was 
either unable or unwilling to further his understanding of the game.

The
 player felt that David Moyes would come down particularly hard on him 
in training sessions, often pointing out errors that he would often 
ignore when they were committed by other players.

Zaha
 was not only player to disagree with Moyes’ methods last season but the problem for the 21-year-old is that the manager’s views
 were often shared by several others around the club.

At least one Premier League manager is
 understood to have been advised to stay away from a January loan move. Nonetheless, in a season in which United slumped to 
their worst finish in 24 years, it seemed bizarre that Zaha was afforded only 28 minutes - as a late 
substitute against Newcastle and Aston Villa - as a Premier League 
player under Moyes.

Eventually,
 he went to Cardiff but after a bright start, even Ole Gunnar Solskjaer,
 one of the more patient characters in the game, felt compelled to drop 
Zaha.

One 
source said only last month: ‘I’m just not sure 
he gets it at United. He really needs to knuckle down now but I don’t 
know if he will listen.’

Certainly, if Van Gaal perceives his defensive awareness to be weaker than that of  Young, it speaks volumes.

United wingers have always expected to blend graft with invention. In 
the Ferguson years, Gary Neville and Denis Irwin appreciated 
the backtracking of David Beckham and Ryan Giggs. In recent times, United
 have only liberated one winger from all defensive responsibilities and 
that was Cristiano Ronaldo.

Clear vision: Louis van Gaal doesn't believe Zaha can fit into any of the midfield positions in his system

In this new era with flying 
wing-backs, the wide players become arguably the most important in the 
team, offering attacking thrust and defensive assurance. It is why Van 
Gaal needs Luke Shaw in prime physical shape and why he retains an 
interest in Ajax’s Daley Blind.

It
 is also why Antonio Valencia was handed a contract extension within 
weeks of Van Gaal joining the club, underlining the Ecuadorian’s 
importance to the new regime as a defensively-minded winger. Zaha, at 
this moment, cannot be trusted in that role.

For
 now, therefore, he must attempt to claw his way into a front-line that 
already boasts Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie, Danny Welbeck and Javier 
Hernandez, as well as young talents Will Keane and James Wilson. It is 
an unenviable task.

Zaha, for all his undoubted potential, scored only 
13 goals in 126 matches in the Championship for Crystal Palace. Van Gaal
 has achieved an awful lot in his esteemed career but to convert Zaha 
into a prolific frontman may extend even beyond his capabilities.

Van
 Gaal insists Zaha is doing everything that is asked of him but it 
remains striking that he is the only member of the club’s 26-man tour 
squad that is yet to appear in a match in the United States.

On Saturday, in the broiling heat of Denver, Zaha, along with the three other substitutes – David de Gea, Anders Lindegaard and Darren Fletcher – were put through intensive interval sprints as part of their post-match warm down.

Conundrum: Louis van Gaal is trying to succeed where Moyes (right) failed and get the best out of Zaha

Drenched in sweat and heading for the showers, Van Gaal then informed the players that they would now be going to the gym for some extra conditioning. Zaha was unimpressed, although in his defence it is difficult to imagine too many players that would relish a double fitness session in such circumstances.

Nonetheless, this is Van Gaal’s way and double sessions have been the order for almost every day since pre-season began in the Dutchman’s absence at the club’s Carrington training ground a few weeks ago.

That much is non-negotiable, as too is Zaha’s new position. He has an opportunity at the FedEx Field – and he must not waste it.
