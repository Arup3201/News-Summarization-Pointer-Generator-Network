An eight-year-old girl has formed an unlikely friendship - with a coyote.

Hailey Hanestad thinks nothing about nuzzling up to the animal, called Wiley, and even dozes off with him on her bed.

She's even taken to howling with him during the evenings. Wiley has been a treasured member of the family since being rescued by Hailey's dad, Rick, three years ago.

Bed alert: Wiley snoozes peacefully while Hailey reads

Friends: Coyote Wiley sniffs Hailey at their home

Today he's thought to be just one of two coyotes in the US that have become domesticated after being born in the wild.

And at the Hanestad farm, near Eau Claire, Wisconsin, he's treated just like a dog - sitting by the fire in the winter, going for walks on a lead and even playing fetch with a tennis ball.

He's got his own comfy chair and enjoys a diet of venison and fried eggs.

He even has to have his meat cooked - because he won't eat it raw. It's a picture of domestic bliss.

Let's just hope he doesn't spot a roadrunner...

Coyotes are a wild species of canine found throughout North and Central America.

Coyote is a Mexican Spanish word with origins in the Aztec work 'coyotl' which means trickster.

They live as far south as Panama and in such cold climates as Alaska.

Wiley is an exceptional coyote since his species is incredibly hard to domesticate unless raised from an early age.

Even then, the coyote's wild nature usually comes out around puberty.

While many species have become threatened with human encroachment, coyotes have actually prospered and become more populous.

They are often seen living near humans and feeding off of garbage.

Coyotes subsist off a variety of foods from deer to insects and other invertebrates.Â 

Like other canines, coyotes live in packs but actually hunt in pairs.

For the most part, they aren't a threat to humans, but attacks have been on the rise in California.
