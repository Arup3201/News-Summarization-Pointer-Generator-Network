Surgeon Puthur Damodaran has been accused of following a woman patient to her car and groping her while she trustingly let him re-examine her for back pain

A 'pervert' hospital surgeon followed a
patient to her car after examining her for back pain - and groped her 
while she trustingly let him re-examine her, a jury has heard.

The
24-year-old blonde woman was molested in a secluded corner of the 
hospital car park after the 40-year-old orthopaedic specialist climbed 
into the car with her.

The 
jury was told that Puthur Damodaran allegedly felt her through her 
clothes before putting one hand under her jeans and pulling at her top.

The
woman, who had been upset at her back pain not being resolved during 
the hospital appointment, said she became suspicious of Damodaran 
continuously looking towards the hospital building and she asked him to 
get out.

She waited for a few minutes before returning to the orthopaedic clinic and reporting his behaviour to nurses.

Prosecutor
Ruby Selva told the jury at Guildford Crown Court: 'There is a special 
relationship between a medical professional and a patient. These are 
professionals we should be able to trust.

'We leave ourselves wholly open, 
especially if we are in pain. It is in these circumstances that this 
defendant sexually assaulted the complainant.

'He did so to satisfy his own perverse needs, banking on the implicit trust we, as members of the public, have in doctors.'

She explained the woman had gone to Leatherhead Hospital, in Surrey, on July 9 last year, to receive the results of a scan.

Her
usual doctor was not there and she was seen instead by 40-year-old 
orthopaedic surgeon Damodaran, with a nurse 'chaperone' present.

The scans had apparently not shown anything to explain her back and leg pain and a full report had not been completed, and the patient left upset and angry.

She made another appointment and left the building and was walking to her car when she noticed someone trying to get her attention. It was the surgeon.

'He was saying: "Don’t get so upset. I’m sure we’ll be able to do something",' she told police in an interview played to the court.

'I thought it was really nice of him to try to calm me down and cheer me up.'

After some general chit-chat and asking about her pain, he was alleged to have said to her: 'I think I forgot to check something but I need you to sit down'.

'Basically he invited himself to my car,' said the patient.

He quickly went to his car to drop something off, before returning. With her sitting in the driver’s seat, he got into the passenger seat and began feeling the areas she said were painful.

She said he asked her to put her seat back and continuously told her to relax, as the 'examination' went further.

'I should not have done it but he was a doctor. I trusted him,' she told police.

'I felt really weird and awkward about it but I thought because he’s a doctor there isn’t anything to worry about.

'I noticed he kept looking towards the hospital and I realised. I said: "I’m just going to wait for the scan result".

'He said: "Are you sure?" And I said: "Yes, please can you leave my car?”'

She told the police Damodaran then stood by her car, still talking to her.

'It was wrong, the way he was looking at me,' she said.

The interviewing officer then asked: 'How would you say he was looking at you?'

'Like a pervert,' said the woman.

She explained that after waiting for 
five to 10 minutes to ensure the doctor had left, she went back into the
hospital, asked to see the nurse who had been in the appointment and 
told her what had happened.

Trial: Dr Damodaran is being tried at Guildford Crown Court, Surrey. He denies a single charge of sexual assault

The
nurse reported the matter to a supervisor and they apparently told the 
patient that what had happened was wrong and they apologised and gave 
her details of how to make a formal complaint.

Damodaran,
of Tanyard Way, Horley, Surrey, was arrested and interviewed twice. He 
issued police with a prepared statement in which he admitted brushing 
the woman’s genitals through her clothes accidentally during the 
appointment but denied conducting an examination in her car.

He denies a single charge of sexual assault.

Under cross-examination the woman victim insisted that the account she had given was correct.

Woman Patient

Brendan
Finucane QC, for the defence, said: 'I don't deny, that because you 
were still very upset, he said he would sit in your car and talk to 
you.'

'I don't think so,' said the complainant.

Mr Finucane asked: 'Well, how did he get in your car then?'

She replied: "He said he needed to check something and I needed to straighten my leg.'

The defence put to her that there was no need to examine her further or ask any of the questions she alleged were put, as it had already been covered during the hospital appointment.

Mr Finucane also suggested the layout of her small car would have made what she had alleged impractical.

He asked whether a later appointment had been brought forward by the hospital following her complaint, which she said had happened.

Judge Christopher Critchlow then asked her: 'Did you make a complaint in the hope you would get seen sooner?'

She answered: 'Definitely not. I just wanted to make sure it didn't happen to anyone else.

'It could have been your family, your daughter, sister. He's meant to be a doctor and not touch you the way he touched me and not in my car.

'I've learned my lesson. I'm not as naive and trusting. I've got no reason to make this up.'

The trial, before Judge Christopher Critchlow at Guildford Crown court, continues.
