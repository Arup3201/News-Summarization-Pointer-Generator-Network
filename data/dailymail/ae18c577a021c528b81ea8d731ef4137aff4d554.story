This is the moment distinguished scribe Nigel Cawthorne came to regret his decision to appear on the Today Show.

In a painfully awkward interview with Karl Stefanovic this morning, the author of Flight MH370 The Mystery was forced to stutter and stumble his way through retorts to the Today host's accusations that his book was 'insensitive', 'too soon' and 'disgusting'.

Flight MH370 The Mystery poses a number of theories about the missing plane, including that it was shot down during a joint military training operation between the US and Thai governments.

A visibly enraged Stefanovic began the interview with Cawthorne, the first person to write a book about the disappearance of flight MH370, with the challenge: 'some are saying this book is way too soon.'

He went on to say 'can you see it would be insensitive to the the families who lost loved ones?'

Cawthorne, a 63-year-old who calls himself 'Britain's most published living author', was forced to admit he had no idea about what happened to the doomed flight during a cringe-worthy six-minute interview.

'None of the theories fit all the facts,' he said.

To claims the release of his book was poorly timed and offensive, Mr Cawthorne told Stefanovic: 'You're giving me the oxygen of publicity...you're being insensitive by having me on.'

Too soon: Karl made thinly-veiled accusations that Cawthorne's book was little more than a money grab

Things got really tense when Stefanovic quoted a segment of the book that asks 'did they die in terror in a flaming wreck, crashing from the sky in the hands of a madman?' of the 239 people on board.

'That's disgusting,' said Stefanovic.

Mr Cawthorne replied: 'well, it is colourful, certainly.'

The London-based author has penned over 150 books on subjects ranging from Ike Turner to Sex Lives Of The Popes.
