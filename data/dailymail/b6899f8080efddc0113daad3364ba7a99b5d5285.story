Leading geneticists from around the world have joined forces to slam a new book which claims there is a biological basis for racial differences in behaviour.

Nearly 150 geneticists have signed a letter condemning the book, written by science writer Nicholas Wade, called A Troublesome Inheritance: Genes, Race and Human History.

The book sparked controversy after claiming recent human evolution has led to racial differences in economic and social behaviour.

But some of the scientists on whom he based parts of his work have lashed out claiming the old Etonian - a former New York Times science editor - has ‘misappropriated’  elements of research from their field.

According the the book's description on the Amazon website, 'Wade argues 
that what we might call middle-class social traits: thrift, docility and
 nonviolence, have been slowly inculcated genetically within agrarian 
societies.

'Also
 controversial are his findings regarding the genetic basis of traits we
 associate with intelligence, such as literacy and numeracy, in certain 
ethnic populations, including the Chinese and Ashkenazi Jews.'

The
 description continues: 'Wade believes deeply in the fundamental 
equality of all people but he is determined to investigate what new 
genetic science shows about how race relates to human history and 
traits, even if it courts controversy.'

In a letter to the New York Times Book Review, they wrote: 'Wade juxtaposes an incomplete and inaccurate account of our research on human genetic differences with speculation that recent natural selection has led to worldwide differences in I.Q. test results, political institutions and economic development. 

'We reject Wade’s implication that our findings substantiate his guesswork. They do not.

'We are in full agreement that there is no support from the field of population genetics for Wade’s conjectures.'

Prominent geneticists including Evan Eichler of the University of Washington, Seattle and Michael Hammer of the University of Arizona were among those who signed the letter.

According to the Independent, Mr Wade, who moved to the U.S. from Britain in 1970, writes in his book that natural selection on the main continents has prompted differences in aspects of the function of the brain.

A description of Mr Wade's book on Amazon.co.uk says of the work: 'The most provocative claims in this book involve the genetic basis of human social habits.

'Wade argues that what we might call middle-class social traits: thrift, docility and nonviolence, have been slowly inculcated genetically within agrarian societies.

'Also controversial are his findings regarding the genetic basis of traits we associate with intelligence, such as literacy and numeracy, in certain ethnic populations, including the Chinese and Ashkenazi Jews.

The description continues: 'Wade believes deeply in the fundamental equality of all people but he is determined to investigate what new genetic science shows about how race relates to human history and traits, even if it courts controversy.'

In a statement, Mr Wade responded to the criticism in the letter by writing: 'This letter is driven by politics, not science.

'I am confident that most of the signatories have not read my book and are responding to a slanted summary devised by the organizers.

'As no reader of the letter could possibly guess, A Troublesome Inheritance argues that opposition to racism should be based on principle, not on the anti-evolutionary myth that there is no biological basis to race.'
