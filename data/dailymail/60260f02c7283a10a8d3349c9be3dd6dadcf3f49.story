My hair is thin and flat, and it never seems to grow longer than just past my shoulders. Do you have any tips for adding much-needed volume?

Karen, 53, Cheshire.

Mother-of-four Karen was fed up of trying to make her limp hair look and feel thicker.

Like many busy women, she had found her hair had thinned, thanks to hormonal changes, but this can also be caused by stress, a poor diet or illness.

BEFORE: Mother-of-four Karen (pictured) is fed-up with trying to make her long, limp hair look thicker 

While Karen had used clip-in hair extensions in the past, and found that they worked well, she wanted a longer-lasting solution.

The most important thing with hair extensions is that they look natural. It’s equally important that they don’t damage your real hair or prevent it from growing.

So, we visited the Real Hair salon in Chelsea, South-West London, where stylist Chanelle applied Beauty Works semi-permanent hair extensions. With 46 shades to choose from, it was easy to match them to Karen’s hair colour.

The strips of hair have a bonded keratin tip, which is attached to your hair. The keratin is transparent, which means that the joins are barely visible. Chanelle blended four different shades into Karen’s hair to create a natural look.

Then, she cut them, so that they blended in with Karen’s natural hair.

AFTER: Karen (pictured) had semi-permanent hair extensions put in at the Real Hair salon in Chelsea, South-West London, they should last six months

The finished result promises to last six months. The keratin bond can withstand washing, drying and brushing — however, good aftercare is essential.

To keep her extensions in top condition, Karen was advised to use a nourishing shampoo and conditioner, along with a serum, heat protection product and weekly deep conditioning mask.

OR TRY THE NEW VOLUMISERS …

Not everyone is suitable for hair extensions. But if they’re not for you, there are some excellent products to use as an alternative.

The new John Frieda Luxurious Volume 7 Day Volume In-Shower Treatment (£9.99, boots.com) is designed for hair that lacks body.

A semi-permanent treatment, it creates volume by building a polymer network onto hair fibres, enhancing the texture and fullness of individual strands.

Shampoo and conditioner can also make a real difference. The Ogario London Revive and Shine Conditioner (£18.50, ogariolondon.com) blends pro-vitamin B5, which boosts the water content of your hair. It is also rich in minerals and ideal for helping to promote healthy hair growth.

Kerastase has invented its first youth activator serum, Densifique Serum Jeunesse (£49, kerastase.co.uk). Apply to the scalp on towel-dried hair. The Trevor Sorbie Rejuvenate range has a collagen and peptide complex to repair and strengthen. Try Rejuvenate Strengthening Treatment (£9.99, Boots) after shampooing, then rinse.

Mousse is an old favourite for volume boosting, as the polymers and binding agents make it easier to style. Try the Andrew Barton Supreme Volume Big Body Beautiful Mousse (£2.50, Asda).

Finally, the Colab Extreme Volume Dry Shampoo (£2.50, Superdrug) in a handy 50 ml size is perfect for volume on the go.

Karen’s extensions were applied at Real Hair, Cale Street, Chelsea. Prices from £350. Beauty Works has more than 1,000 stockists across the UK and Ireland (beautyworksonline.com). 

UNSUNG HERO  

Lotil (from £3.59, Boots)

Lotil (from £3.59, Boots) is such a useful, versatile skin product. Amazingly, it’s been around for more than 100 years and can be used to soothe insect bites, blisters, burns and even skin conditions such as psoriasis and eczema. The rich, hydrating formula has anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties. The cream is thick, so it needs to be worked into the skin until absorbed. 

BARGAIN BUY

Essence long-lasting lipsticks (£2.30, wilko.com )

Nude shades are big news for spring — especially for lips. The secret is to find a shade that complements your complexion. The new collection of Essence long-lasting lipsticks (£2.30, wilko.com) has a shade to suit all skin tones. 

ELSA'S PICK  

Bobbi Brown has launched a limited edition shade of its iconic Pot Rouge — Pretty Powerful 11 (£19, Bobbi Brown). Just a tiny touch will give lips or cheeks a boost of fresh colour. For each compact sold, the full price (less VAT) will be donated to Smart Works, a charity that gives styling advice to out-of-work women. 

Rimmel Sun Shimmer Self-Tan Mousse (£7.99, Boots) is a fast-drying tan that develops in one hour. Massage the mousse in with a tanning mitt to ensure an even coverage. It comes in three shades — light, medium and dark — and all are matte, so there’s no unwanted sparkle.

For your first self-tan of the year, it’s always best to build up the colour slowly — so if you’re fair-skinned, start with the lightest shade and use it over three days to get a natural glow.

It’s always a good idea to pick a face mask based on your skin’s individual needs. The new NSpa masks cost just £1.59, or two for £3 at Asda, so you can choose one or two to address your skin’s particular issues. Choose from Radiance Boosting, which infuses skin with vitamins and brightens the complexion, Warming Detox, which draws out impurities, Deep Cleansing Mud, which gives skin a real glow, or Professional Peeling, which will calm down your blemishes.
