Fernando Torres has ended three-and-a-half disappointing years at Chelsea by agreeing a move to AC Milan.

The Spaniard replaces Mario Balotelli as Milan's lead striker following the Italian's £16million transfer to Liverpool.

Torres' agent held talks with Milan on Thursday morning and the striker has agreed to join the Italian giants on a two-year deal.

Goals: 81

Goals per game ratio: 1.8 matches

Cost per goal (signed for £24m): £296,000

Chelsea (2011-14)

Appearances: 172

Goals: 45

Goals per game ratio: 3.8 matches

Cost per goal (signed for £50m): £1.1m 

Spain (2003-)

Goals: 38

Goals per game ratio: 2.9 matches

The 30-year-old has moved to the San Siro on a two-year loan deal.

The £50million Stamford Bridge flop had two years left on his £150,000-a-week deal at Stamford Bridge and it is believed that his representatives negotiated a significant severance package before Torres agreed to a move. 

After a difficult start at the Bridge following his move from Liverpool, Torres' form never really picked up for Chelsea.

He managed just 45 goals in 172 appearances - equating to a staggering £1.1million per strike.

Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho was keen to offload Torres before the transfer window closes on Monday in order to bring in an alternative forward - with Loic Remy now close to completing a move from West London rivals Queens Park Rangers.

Milan were believed to have been interested in bringing Queens Park Rangers's Adel Taarabt back to the San Siro but that move is now off following Torres' arrival.

The mercurial QPR winger spent the last six months of the 2013-14 season on loan with the seven-time European Cup winners, scoring four goals in 16 appearances.

Harry Redknapp remains keen to offload Taarabt once again.
