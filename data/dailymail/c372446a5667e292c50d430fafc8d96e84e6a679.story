A mother’s life has been saved by doctors who completely drained her of blood.

Natasha Bigby, 36, from Birmingham, suffered a rare condition which caused her arteries to fill with deadly blood clots.

Surgeons had to drain her body of blood to allow them to remove the tiny clots which could have killed her.

Natasha Bigly's life was saved by doctors who cleared her pulmonary arteries of blood clots after draining the blood from her body and reducing her core body temperature to just 18 degrees

They also had to reduce Ms Bigby’s body temperature from a normal 37 degrees to an incredibly low 18.

Amazingly, she has now made a full recovery and is looking forward to Christmas with her daughter.

Ms Bigby said: ‘When the doctors told me about the operation I was amazed.

‘Having my blood drained out of me sounded like something out of a horror film. I have a little girl and when I thought about the risks it was just awful.

‘I just had to remember that it was going to save my life.’

Ms Bigby was diagnosed with a condition called pulmonary hypertension.

Ms Bigly had high blood pressure in her pulmonary artery because it was partially blocked by blood clots. This meant the blood could not easily flow through it and caused her to suffer breathlessness and chest pains

The condition occurs when the blood pressure in the pulmonary artery increases.

As in Ms Bigby’s case, it can be caused by blood clots blocking the artery and making it difficult for blood to flow through it.

This can cause breathlessness, fatigue, faintness and heart problems.

Pulmonary endarterectomy is a surgical procedure that removes chronic blood clots from the arteries in the lungs.

It involves the patient being connected to a heart-lung machine that takes over from the heart and lungs during the procedure.

The patient's body is then cooled to 18 degrees - down from the normal 37 degrees - to prevent damage while the machine is switched off and the blood is removed from the body.

While the arteries are briefly emptied of blood, surgeons can remove the clots.

Once this has been done, the patient is warmed up to a normal body temperature and taken off the bypass machine.

The operation usually takes eight to ten hours.

She said: ‘I’ve always been perfectly healthy but last November I went to Jamaica to visit my grandfather.

‘He lives on the top of a hill - which I’ve always been able to walk up - but I was finding it really difficult.

‘I could hardly breathe and it just took me ages - it was then that I knew something was wrong.

‘Back
 at home, I was getting really bad chest pains and swelling - my feet 
were getting enormous - by the summer I could hardly breathe.’

Initially
 doctors diagnosed Ms Bigby with a blood clot, but after collapsing at 
her home, and suffering from chest pains, she was rushed to hospital.

She said: ‘At the hospital a cardiologist told me that they needed to contact another hospital to get some advice.

‘I was getting really worried because no one seemed to know what was wrong with me and I just didn’t know what was going on.

‘They put me in the intensive care 
unit and I just couldn’t understand why - everyone else in there was 
really ill and I was awake and chatting away.’

Ms
 Bigby was transferred to Papworth Hospital in Cambridgeshire where her 
condition worsened and she became dependent on breathing support.

Doctors had to use a heart-lung bypass machine to take over the work of her Ms Bigby's heart and lungs. The machine drained her arteries of blood meaning the surgeons could remove the clots while the arteries were emptied of blood.

She said: ‘It was at Papworth where they revealed the true extent of my condition.

‘They
 explained that I’d been rushed down there because they were the only 
hospital in the country that could perform the procedure.

‘I felt relieved to know that I was 
in safe hands but I was so scared. I was almost inconsolable in the days
 leading up to the surgery, I was scared I’d never see my daughter 
again.

‘But the doctors and nurses were fantastic - they did everything they could to make me feel at ease.

‘When
 the day of the operation came on August 14 I was so nervous, but I just
 had to focus on the bigger picture - I needed this to save my life.’

Before her life-saving surgery, Ms Bigly's legs became very swollen because of her condition

The procedure - known as a pulmonary endarterectomy - involves the patient being put on a heart-lung bypass machine which temporarily takes over the work of the heart and lungs.

The body is then cooled to a temperature of just 18 degrees to prevent damage caused by the lack of oxygenated blood flowing around the body.

The surgeons then have just 20 minutes to remove the clots while the arteries are emptied of blood.

Ms Bibgy said: ‘When I came round I felt better straight away. My recovery has gone swimmingly and I’m finally starting to feel like me again.

‘Getting to go home, after everything I’d been through was incredible - it’s all I’d wanted all along.

Ms Bigby said: 'When the doctors told me about the operation I was amazed. Having my blood drained out of me sounded like something out of a horror film'

‘I’m truly amazed at what the surgeons at Papworth did for me, they saved my life.’

Consultant Cardiothoracic Surgeon David Jenkins, who leads the national PEA programme, said: ‘The pulmonary endarterectomy procedure is one of the longest and more complex cardiothoracic operations we perform.

‘Despite the technical difficulty, this procedure is very satisfying as it transforms lives, improving both quality of life and prognosis.

‘It is very rewarding to see patients, like Natasha, with a new lease of life, after struggling to breathe and do the simplest of things, like walking down the street.’
