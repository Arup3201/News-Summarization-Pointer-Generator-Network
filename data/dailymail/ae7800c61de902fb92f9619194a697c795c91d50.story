A retired Coutts banker laundered £655,000 of the proceeds from a multi-million pound fraud run by his son, a court heard.

Roger Noad is accused of allowing his son Matthew, 29, to funnel £655,000 through his bank accounts over six years. Noad worked for Queen's bank Coutts for 30 years.  

Jurors at the Old Bailey in London were told that Matthew Noad was 23 and living at home with his parents in Kent when he launched a cold-calling investment scam with Clive Griston, 52.

Roger Noad, 60, and his wife Linda, 58, of Sevenoaks, are accused of charges relating to their son's fraud

The scam, which involved the men using glossy brochures to persuade elderly victims to buy land on the basis that they would get high returns if if was developed, earned them vast amounts, the court heard.

Matthew Noad made around £2.1million from it, £655,000 of which he transferred to his parents in a series of payments to their Coutts account, jurors heard.

The court was told how Roger Noad, 60, and his wife Linda, 58, went on an expensive holiday to Dubai with their son, and witnessed his extravagant spending on wines, a new Mercedes and jewellery worth £18,000.

Prosecutor Mark Fenhalls said Noad Sr had introduced his son to Griston and must have suspected where the money was coming from.

'Roger Noad worked for Coutts bank for 30 years,' the prosecutor told jurors. 'You may consider a man who works for a bank must be better informed and more likely to ask questions, particularly when the sums are spectacularly eye-watering.'

'You will have to consider the lifestyle he was enjoying while living with his parents.'

Mr Fenhalls said that when the Noads went to Dubai, they were 'no doubt enjoying with Matthew the fruits of the fraud.'

Land scam: Matthew Noad, 29, left, and Clive Griston, 52, right, have already admitted two counts of fraud

Defendant: Kerry Golesworthy, 38, of Orpington, denies two charges relating to fraud

Griston laundered a total of £996,000 through the account of his partner Kerry Golesworthy, 48, while he was facing bankruptcy, it is claimed.

The money was used to put a deposit on a £790,000 home in Orpington and to buy a new £109,000 Bentley, £40,000 of furniture and a £10,000 pearl necklace, jurors were told.

Mr Fenhalls said: 'They can only have been seeking to buy this house because they knew there was going to be a lot of money coming in to finance it.

'Given there was a petition for his bankruptcy, it is hardly surprising they chose to put it into their home.'

The prosecutor said the necklace was probably a Christmas present for Golesworthy, who earned less than £9,000 a year through bookkeeping.

He added: 'She is plainly a competent woman with a thoroughly respectable and experienced career.

'Her earnings are not consistent with the colossal sums that are passing through various banks she is controlling.'

Jurors were told Griston, of Orpington, Kent, and Matthew Noad, of Keston, Kent, have already admitted running the land investment scam and a second fraud involving worthless carbon credits, and have been sentenced.

Golesworthy, of Orpington, and Linda and Roger Noad, both of Sevenoaks, Kent, all deny entering into an arrangement facilitating the use of criminal property relating to the land fraud.

Roger Noad and Golesworthy also both deny a charge of converting criminal property..

The trial continues.
