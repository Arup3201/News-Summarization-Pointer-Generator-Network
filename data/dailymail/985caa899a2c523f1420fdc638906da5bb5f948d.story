During the 1990s, financial adviser to the stars Dana Giacchetto lived like the punk-rock prince of New York City who by his own admission, 'flew too close to the sun and spun out of control.'

His palace was a mammoth SoHo penthouse where he hosted drug-fueled orgies witnessed by a pair of cockatoos named Angel and Tiberius - one each for him and his best-friend, Leonardo DiCaprio.

At the height of his rebel-reign, he and the then 23-year-old star of Titanic defiantly watched the 1998 Academy Awards at his Manhattan apartment, while over in  Los Angeles the James Cameron blockbuster won 11 Oscars.

'I was king of the world,' said Giacchetto to The Hollywood Reporter.. 'We projected the Academy Awards on the wall and had every star come to New York to give the middle finger because we felt the Academy Awards were a complete f---ing sellout and anti-punk rock.'

His influence on DiCaprio was such, that he reputedly inspired the Hollywood stars' performance in The Wolf of Wall Street, despite their friendship ending when he pleaded guilty to misappropriating nearly $20 million of his clients' money in 2000.

Giacchetto, who is now 51, spent three-years in prison for his fraud after swindling millions from clients who included, R.E.M front man Michael Stipe, Spiderman star Tobey Maguire, Cameron Diaz and Ben Affleck.

Indeed, he was back in court in February facing charges that he used a friend's credit card to rack up $10,045 in charges to buy liquor, a plane ticket and food, according to court filings.

But while he vehemently denies that, in new revealing interview with The Hollywood Reporter, he positively revels in the speculation he was his former friends muse for The Wolf of Wall Street.

However, unlike trader Jordan Belfort, whose story is told in the Martin Scorcese hit, Giacchetto tries to claim he is not a fraud - despite his conviction.

'I'm the Lamb of Wall Street,' said Giacchetto to The Hollywood Reporter.

'If I wasn't dragged from an airplane at gunpoint, I would've been able to fix the positions. Whether clients lost money because the market went down or because I was a f—-up, I felt really bad about it.

'I never stole money in my life. Why would I do that to the people that I love?'

Inspiration: The muse for DiCaprio's performance in the Martin Scorcese movie The Wolf of Wall Street was allegedly Dana Giacchetto

In 2000, Giacchetto was arrested at Newark Airport, traveling with a fake passport trying to flee the country having admitted fraud involving his incredible list of clients money.

Displaying the charisma which no doubt enamored him to talented actors, musicians, directors, artists and Oscar winners, punk-rock fan Giacchetto's big break was brokering the deal for a small underground Seattle record label, Sub Pop, in 1991.

On their books was an unknown grunge band named Nirvana, who were tipped for the top.

Together with Giacchetto's investment firm, the Cassandra Group, 49-percent of Sub Pop was sold to Warner Music Group in 1994 for $20 million - many times its expected value.

By his 37th birthday in 1998, Giacchetto controlled by his estimation, $5 billion in assets - needing to hire a young lawyer called Chris Cuomo, the brother of New York Governor Andrew and current host of CNN's New Day.

Armed with success and money, Giacchetto embarked on one huge party - and the celebrity he was indelibly linked to was a young Leonardo DiCaprio.

The actor, 12-years Giacchetto's junior, was already on the road to superstardom and spent months living in his friends lavish SoHo apartment.

He took him on tours of the New York Stock Exchange and they were frequently spotted at parties together and lunching.

Giacchetto told The Hollywood Reporter that he believes he is definitely the inspiration for DiCarpio in The Wolf of Wall Street, although the actor has never mentioned this

He claims to have been told that when DiCaprio was asked if his old friend was his template, he demurred, 'No, not exactly.'

Calling this 'lovely', the convicted fraudster reminisces about the life he led and its similarities to the crazed-lifestyle portrayed in movie.

'I lived it -- not the stealing-money-from-poor-people part. Listen, the sex and the drugs and the decadence in my life was 10 times worse than Wolf, a bacchanalian orgy for 10 years,' said Giacchetto to The Hollywood Reporter.

'There was sex constantly, there were drugs constantly, but there was no sex without condoms ever that I ever witnessed. There were certain rules, and that was one of those rules.'

Like a raging Master of the Universe or Wall Street Jay Gatsby, the tales of Giacchetto's parties are legendary.

'There were lots of weird sex scenes,' says one prominent Giacchetto partygoer to The Hollwyood Reporter.

'The loft had $300 champagne, $5,000 hookers, top models, rockers, actors and artists. There also were two cockatoos, Angel and Tiberius -- one each for Giacchetto and DiCaprio. 

Friends: Michael Stipe of R.E.M. (left) was one of the fraudsters friends as was Ben Affleck (right with his best friend Matt Damon)

'Victoria Leacock Hoffman, a friend of Andy Warhol, Martin Scorsese and Giacchetto, attended a Christmas party at the loft and later threw Molly Ringwald's 30th birthday party there, both of which she says were fairly tame.

'Leo was always sweet and gentlemanly,' she says.

Giacchetto's riotous parties also welcomed Johnny Depp, Winona Ryder, Kate Moss, Michael Stipe and Mark Wahlberg - although there are no accounts or suggestions of them partaking in anything nefarious.

'I had all my windows open, and John F. Kennedy Jr. was standing there,' said Giacchetto to The Hollywood Reporter.

'Everyone's like, 'Don't fall out that f---in' window!'

His friendship with DiCaprio was so strong that it went beyond money - he claims to have fallen out with the actor's manager over his career trajectory.

'I had a fight with DiCaprio's then-manager Rick Yorn,' said Giacchetto to The Hollywood Reporter.

'He wanted Leonardo to make American Psycho,' as did DiCaprio. 'I called Leo's dad, George, I called Leo's mom, Irmelin. I said, 'Leo, if you do this movie, you must move out. Cutting people up? Is that what you're about?'

Giacchetto also told The Hollywood Reporte about his controversial relationshps with one time Walt Disney Company chief Mike Ovitz and Hollywood superagent, Jay Maloney, who tragically ended his life in November 1999 after problems with depression.

'My performance for so many years was so good and quantitative -- not bullshit, not boiler room, really good -- that I started to get the Ovitzes of the world and the very, very serious heavy-hitter asset managers to say, 'This guy actually f---ing knows how to trade,' said the fraudster.

'He has a gift. He may be a flake, he may be effeminate, but he knows what he's f---ing doing.' I'm some crazy mathematical rock-star wacko who sold Sub Pop and Matador and made a lot of money.'

Despite his convictions, Giacchetto denies he was a thief.

His problems began when his previously safe investments began to falter in the late 1990s and instead of telling his famous friends, he attempted to cover up his losses.

He began moving money from one account to another, but when he was taken into custody on April 12, 2000, he was carrying only $4,000 in tens and fives.

Investments: Dana Giacchetto helped broker the deal that sold Sub Pop - who boasted Nirvana and Kurt Cobain on their books to Warner Music in 1994 and hosted JFK. Jr. to one of his parties too

'I never planned to steal people's money. I got in over my head on deals that lost money. But I never stole.'

His friendships with the rich and famous ended - or they did officially according to Giacchetto.

'When I go to Hollywood and see all my old clients, which I do, it's always off the record,' he said to The Hollywood Reporter.

'Even the people that I loved the most, they would answer the phone like, 'I'm afraid to see you,' because Hollywood is so small. Leo, I mean, we only talked through lawyers through the years because we're afraid.'

Despite his impending credit card fraud, Giacchetto says that he has found happiness as the father of two children, although their mother has left him.

He is friends with heiress and fashionista Daphne Guinness and plays in Manhattan with his band, Element 4.

Indeed, his entrepreneurial skills are still strong. He owns a food business called Taste which makes salsa.

However, he will always remember the heady days of the late 1990s as witnessed by his 2001 sentencing, when he told the judge, 'I lived in a world of fantasy.'
