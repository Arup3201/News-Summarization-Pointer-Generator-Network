Accused: Jeffrey Daday, 35, is charged with second-degree grand larceny, a felony offence

A parking attendant has been accused of stealing $89,000 in small change from metres over a five-year period.

Jeffrey Daday, a 35-year-old from Brewster in New York state, is charged with second-degree grand larceny, a felony offence, according to prosecutors in Westchester County.

District Attorney Janet DiFiore accused Daday of routinely emptying meters around his home town and depositing hundreds of thousands of loose coins at a local bank since early 2009.

According to the DA, Daday's spree began on January 5 of that year and continued until his arrest last Tuesday.

With tens thousands of pounds going missing of the five-year period, police had been called in to investigate who was behind the scam.

They watched Daday's movements over a period of a few days, and were shocked to apparently see the parking attendant emptying meters before visiting a bank to deposit the coins.

Last Tuesday the investigators confronted Daday as he left the bank, arresting him on suspicion of depositing the coins into his own personal bank account.

He was subsequently released on bail and is expected to appear in court later today.

If convicted of grand larceny in the second degree, Daday could face up to 15 years in prison. There is no minimum sentence for the crime for first time offenders in New York state.

Parking metres in the Westchester County area take quarters (25 cent coins), dimes (10 cent coins) and nickels (5 cent coins).

To amass a total of $89,000, Daday would have had to have taken 356,000 quarters or 890,000 dimes or 1.78 million nickels.
