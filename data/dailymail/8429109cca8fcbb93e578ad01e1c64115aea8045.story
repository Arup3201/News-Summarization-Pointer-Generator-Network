Rafael Nadal eased into the third round of the Miami Open on a day when rain curtailed proceedings in Florida.

The second seed's 6-4, 6-2 win over Nicolas Almagro was the fourth and final match played on the main court before the rain fell forcing 10 contests to be postponed until Saturday, including women's top seed Serena Williams' match against Monica Niculescu which did not start.

Nadal has made the final four times at the event without claiming the title but looked to be in ominous form as he brushed aside his fellow Spaniard 6-4, 6-2 in 89 minutes.

Rafael Nadal beat fellow Spaniard Nicolas Almagro in straight sets in their second-round clash 

The second seed was in good form as he brushed his countryman aside to reach the third round 

'In general, I think I played a solid match,' he said. 'I played well. I had good movement. I had to put the balls in and play with no mistakes, that was the idea today with very tough conditions.

'Almagro was not an easy opponent for the first (second) round. I am happy for that.'

Heather Watson meanwhile, will have to mount a comeback against Angelique Kerber when her rain-interrupted match  resumes.

Kerber had just taken the first set 7-5 during the second round match when the players were brought off court due to the weather and, although the rain stopped for a short time, it soon returned and play was abandoned for the day.

Earlier, third seed and British No 1 Andy Murray  cruised into the third round with a comfortable 6-4, 6-2 win over America's Donald Young.

Murray will now face Colombian Santiago Giraldo, a 6-2, 3-6, 6-0 winner over Robin Haase as he aims for a third Miami triumph after lifting the title in 2009 and 2012.

Stan Warwrinka advanced with a hard-fought 6-7 (7/9), 7-5, 6-2 win over Carlos Berlocq while Tomas Berdych had an easier time of it, beating Hyeon Chung 6-3, 6-4 to set up a clash with Bernard Tomic, a 7-6 (8/6) 7-5 winner over American Austin Krajicek.

Home favourite Sam Querrey was knocked out as he lost 6-7 (5/7), 7-6 (7/3), 6-4 to Kevin Anderson while Dominic Thiem also needed three sets to beat 10th seed Feliciano Lopez 7-6 (7/4), 4-6, 6-3.

There were also wins for Leonardo Mayer, who overcame Jarkko Nieminen 6-4, 7-6 (7/5) and Guillermo Garcia-Lopez, a 6-4 6-4 winner over Jan-Lennard Struff.
