An unemployed single mother that owed
the city of Chicago $105,000 in parking fines has reached a settlement 
involving the city and her ex-boyfriend..

Officials
claimed Jennifer Fitzgerald owed $105,761.80 for 678 parking violations
issued to a 1999 Chevrolet Monte Carlo registered in her name - by far 
the biggest parking fine in city history - but have reached a settlement
with her and ex-boyfriend Brandon Preveau.

Fitzgerald
fought the fines by arguing her ex-boyfriend registered the old car in 
her name and parked it at O'Hare Airport without her knowing. All 678 
tickets were issued and placed on the car without it ever being towed 
away, according to the Chicago Tribune.

Revenge: Brandon Preveau, right, allegedly racked up thousands of dollars in parking fines in the name of his ex-girlfriend Jennifer Fitzgerald, left

Victim: Ms Fitzgerald was subjected to the prank after the end of her relationship with Mr Preveau

The
ruling requires Preveau to pay a down payment of $1,600 and for 
Fitzgerald to pay $78 a month for the next three years until the balance
is settled, the Tribune reported.

Fitzgerald maintained while suing the city for relief of the fees that Preveau
bought the Chevy from her uncle and registered it in her name before 
parking it in the employee lot at O'Hare without her knowing, according 
to the Tribune. Preveau works at the airport, the paper noted.

In
addition to receiving abandoned car tickets, the jalopy was also 
repeatedly ticketed for improperly ticketed windows, not having a city 
parking sticker, expired plates and registration, cracked or missing 
windows and broken tail lights, according to the Tribune.

'Parties
came together and worked out a reasonable resolution to this 
situation,' city spokesperson Roderick Drew told the paper. 'By 
following the terms of the settlement, at the end of this three year 
period Ms. Fitzgerald will be able to resolve the debts, receive her 
driver’s license — which she could not have with all of these tickets 
hanging over her head — and she can move on with her life.'

Ticketed: This Chevy Monte Carlo ultimately racked up $105,761.80 in fines over three years

Punishment: Ms Fitzgerald's bill for the parking violations represents the biggest fine ever levied in Chicago

Preveau, a United Airlines 
employee, abandoned the vehicle at an airport parking lot around 
November 17, 2009, according to a complaint first reported by The Expired Meter.

It is O'Hare parking policy to remove a car after
30 days to an impound lot. Yet it took until October 26 this year to impound the dark grey Monte Carlo, according to Department of Aviation 
spokesman Karen Pride.

During
the nearly three-year ordeal, Ms Fitzgerald was unable to remove her 
name from the registration and was forced into court to address the 
growing fines.

Finally,
with the help of an attorney, she has filed a counter lawsuit asking 
the court to find she was not the owner of the car and therefore not 
liable for the parking tickets.

Though not all the tickets were dismissed, Fitzgerald was at least able to reduce the fines to a more reasonable level.
