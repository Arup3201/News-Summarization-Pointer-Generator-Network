Scores of Syrian refugees have occupied the Calais ferry terminal and are threatening to kill themselves unless they are granted passage to Britain.

A dozen are on hunger strike and two yesterday vowed to leap off the roof of the terminal building unless their demands were met.

They said they were treated ‘like dogs’ by the French authorities but believed they would be lavished with benefits if they reached the UK.

Unlike Britain, France does not pay benefits to asylum seekers while their claims are being processed.

About 40 Syrians have refused to move from a passenger gangway.

When French riot police tried to clear them yesterday, two men climbed on to the roof of the ferry ticket hall and threatened to jump.

Others erected placards reading: ‘We want to start a new life in England’ and ‘We want to talk to David Cameron’.

A spokesman for Calais port said there was 'no disruption to ferry services' so far caused by the protest.

Many said Britain was a ‘better’ place to settle, despite Syria’s close historical links with France.

Ali, 38, said that despite French President Francois Hollande’s strong stance against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, the French were not welcoming.

‘Here even animals are better treated than us,’ he said.

Father-of-six Zakarya Sheikh Kelo (pictured) has walked, driven and flown across Europe to escape Syria – but says he will not stop until he gets to Britain.

Once here, the 45-year-old English teacher plans to bring the rest of his family  to join him.

He fled the war-torn Syrian city of Aleppo on September 10 with his wife and six children, aged five to 18, and crossed the border on foot into Turkey.

He left his family there and paid a gang of people-smugglers his life savings,  worth £9,000, to take him to Britain.

Mr Kelo said: ‘I refuse any country but England. I chose England because the procedures are quicker to get  asylum, and once I am there it is easier to bring my whole family too.’

But he and fellow refugees were double-crossed by the people-smugglers, who took them to France instead.

‘From across the border, I was taken by a taxi to Istanbul, and from there put on a flight.

'They said it was to London, but it landed in  Paris … Since then I have tried ten times to get on trucks going to England but every time they [the French police] found me.’

Tarik, 19, added: ‘We live outside like dogs, hunted down by the police. We see we are not welcome. How can we seek asylum here?’

One of the refugees, father-of-six Zakarya Sheikh Kelo, 45, described escaping Syria via Turkey and then catching a flight to Paris before travelling by bus to Calais.

He said Turkey and France were both ‘safe’ but demanded to be allowed on to Britain, where he could apply for his family to join him.

Philippe Wannesson, from a group working with refugees in Calais, said a growing number of Syrians were arriving in the town wanting to reach the UK.

‘A year ago we saw perhaps only two, three or four,’ he said.

‘Since March or April it has been rising to 20, 30, 40 and steadily growing.’

The UK Border Force denied claims that two of its officials were at the port ‘negotiating’ with the protesters. A spokesman said they were there ‘purely in a supporting role’.

However, the mayor of Calais, Natacha Bouchart, demanded action at Westminster.

‘The British must make a decision,’ she said. ‘It is unacceptable that it is in France and at Calais that one has to control immigration.’

The group has been occupying the ferry terminal since Wednesday, although crossings are not being disrupted, a port spokesman said.

The dozen hunger strikers have vowed to continue their protest. Last night, one of them fainted and was taken away by ambulance.

Another of the group hung up another cardboard placard, bearing the slogan: ‘Britain is a fair country, and that is why we want to go there – we will be treated well by the British government.’

Dr Martina Devries, of Medecins du Monde, a medical charity supporting the refugees, said: ‘These people are not being helped by the French government, which does not give them food or clothes or shelter.

‘The French police persecute them, moving them on all the time. There are about 40 men and ten women, including one who is seven months pregnant, and seven children.

‘They don’t want to stay in France, and they are increasingly desperate and determined to get to the UK.

‘They have been trying to get on to trains and trucks, and even swimming across the harbour to board ferries.’

Denis Robin, the prefect of the Pas-de-Calais region, said the Syrians had a ‘95 per cent chance of success’ if they applied for asylum in France.

The United Nations refugee agency said France has offered to take in 10,000 Syrians.

The war to oust President Assad has forced two million refugees to flee to neighbouring countries such as Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.

The brutal war in Syria has claimed more than 100,000 lives since it started in early 2011
