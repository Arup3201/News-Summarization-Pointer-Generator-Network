British Gas revealed today it made £23 every second from its customers in the first six months of 2013 and hinted at more price rises.

After raising its prices just before last year's record-breaking cold winter, the energy giant raked in a £356million profit from households during the first half of this year - up 3.2 per cent on 2012.

As people cranked up the heating to deal with plunging temperatures, residential gas consumption alone soared by 18 per cent during the first four months of 2013.

The news has led to consumer groups demanding they freeze the price of gas and electricity to ensure households can afford to keep warm this winter.

Parent company Centrica also enjoyed bumper profits of £1.58billion for the past six months - up nine per cent - causing its shares to rise sharply this morning.

Facts: A huge rise in revenue from households driven by a price increase and freezing conditions helped British Gas increase residential profits to £356million

Its profits would have been higher but were held back by a new duty to pay for energy efficiency measures in customers' homes, which helped push environmental costs up 37 per cent for the period.

Centrica warned that the scheme, which has landed it with a £1.4 billion bill, would 'inevitably impact on customer bills ultimately' and that it was facing 'upward pressure on costs'.

Finance director Nick Luff said: 'We will keep prices as low as we can for as long as we can. If prices do have to go up, we will delay it for as long as possible.'

Today consumer group uSwitch said British Gas should not raise its prices again this year.

'The 
fact that British Gas has absorbed increasing costs so far this year 
will be of cold comfort to consumers who may be fearing the worst – 
especially with rumours of price rises. Profits are up from last year, 
so we would urge British Gas to help quell customer's fears and go one 
step further from its May pledge and commit to a price freeze for the 
rest of the year,' spokesman Tom Lyon said.

'People are already starting to worry
about next winter and the cost of their energy bills and high energy 
prices have a big impact on consumers. Last winter, almost seven in ten 
households went without heating at some point to keep their energy costs
down.'

But Centrica maintain they are giving consumers a good deal.

Chief executive Sam Laidlaw said: 
'With our customers using more gas to stay warm during the unusually 
cold winter, we're doing everything we can to help them keep their 
energy costs under control and make bills simpler and clearer.'

Today's announcement of its half-year
financial results are likely to spark anger as it is revealed how 
British Gas boosted its bottom line via the steep bills landing on 
customers' doorsteps in the wake of the freeze.

The earnings announcement comes a day after French-owned energy firm EDF said its profits had risen to a record £903million in the wake of the cold spell.

British Gas's rise in profits does not entirely reflect gains from heavy winter gas usage, which are likely to have been offset by the cost of a new obligation to deliver energy efficiency measures in customers' homes, analysts said.

The company has been the subject of sustained hostility as it awarded multimillion-pound pay packets to executives while customers have struggled to pay rising energy bills amid the economic downturn.

Its results announcement also comes as new rules on simpler energy tariffs provoke an industry backlash. Rival provider SSE said the changes would 'add cost and complexity to energy suppliers' relationships with customers'.

In June, Centrica muscled in on the UK's potential shale gas boom by buying a 25 per cent stake in the Lancashire Bowland exploration area, paying £40million cash and pledging tens of millions in further funds for the venture, which is operated by Cuadrilla Resources.
