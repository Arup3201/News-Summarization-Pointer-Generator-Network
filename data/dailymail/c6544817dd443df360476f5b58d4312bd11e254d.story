The Premier League and Sky Sports have been told to stop playing matches on Remembrance Sunday and accused of lacking respect for the day.

Four top-flight matches were played on November 9 last year, which marked Remembrance Sunday. Newcastle against West Brom and Swansea versus Arsenal were broadcast on Sky Sports.

But Labour MP Sharon Hodgson on Thursday asked the House of Commons for a rule change which would see all matches played on the Saturday or Monday of the weekend nearest November 11.

Hodgson, the MP for Washington and Sunderland West, is concerned that matches were played on Remembrance Sunday the past two years at Sunderland's Stadium of Light against Everton and Manchester City.

In the two years previous to that another four fixtures were played on Remembrance Sunday around the country. In the past decade there have only been two occasions when Remembrance Sunday has not had any top-flight fixtures — in 2005 and 2011.

Hodgson urged Sports Minister Helen Grant to speak to the Premier League and Sky Sports to convince them to not schedule matches on Remembrance Sunday this year — on November 15.

Hodgson said: 'As we're well into the 100-year commemorations of the First World War would you re-assure the House, veterans in my area as well as my local armed forces network, that you will ask Sky to reconsider the scheduling of their broadcast of their matches on Remembrance Sunday — which has happened in Sunderland two years in a row — and instead schedule the games for the Saturday so as to respect the original intentions of this special day — remembering those who give their lives for our country.'

Ms Grant replied: 'It is important to always remember those who sacrifice their lives for our country. I'm very happy to have a chat with you on those issues.'

Sky Sports and the Premier League declined to comment when contacted by Sportsmail.

Surprisingly, the MP only mentioned football, failing to notice that the ATP World Tour tennis finals in London and horse racing meetings were also broadcast that day. In previous years there have been rugby internationals too.

Football, encouraged by the Daily Mail, has done plenty to mark Remembrance Sunday in recent years. For the past four seasons, clubs have had the British Legion poppy emblem embroidered on shirts. Last year, the centenary year of the First World War, all Premier League clubs wore a special poppy on their shirts emblazoned with '1914-2014 Football Remembers.'

Clubs up and down the country held a minutes' silence out of respect ahead of matches. Arsenal installed two giant poppies above Armoury Square overlooking Hornsey Road at their Emirates Stadium. The tribute remained in place until Armistice Day, on November 11.

A Premier League spokesman said:

'Remembrance weekend matches have long been part of English football, with fans and players alike using the occasion to pay their respects.

'Our clubs and their fans mark these occasions in a number of ways including raising money for the Royal British Legion, providing match tickets for service personnel and their families via Tickets for Troops, players wearing poppies on their shirts and clubs linking up with local regiments and giving them roles on a match day.

'It is hugely appreciated by the armed forces.

'Remembering those who fought and died in World War 1 has been an integral part of our Football Remembers work over the past year. This has included providing education resources for every school in the UK, and holding a Truce Tournament for academy boys from across Europe in Ypres, Belgium. This activity has been done with the full support, involvement and encouragement of the Sports Minister and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.'
