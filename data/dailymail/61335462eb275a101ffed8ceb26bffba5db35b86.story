A man who raped and killed an eight-year-old girl before stashing her body in a dryer has been found guilty of ten counts including capital murder.

Billy Frank Davis Jr, 31, snatched Ahliyah Nachelle Irvin from  the living room of her Topeka apartment as she slept, before sexually assaulting and choking the little girl.

Jurors will return to Shawnee County court in Kansas tomorrow to hear more evidence before deciding whether to recommend that Davis receive the death penalty or life without parole.

Ahliyah's parents wept silently as the bailiff read that Davis was found guilty of two counts of capital murder, one count of premeditated first-degree murder and seven other charges, the Topeka Capital-Journal reported.

Prosecutors said Davis killed the child in March 2012 to hide that he had sexually assaulted her. 

But his defense team argued that Davis did not have the mental capability to form the intent to kill the girl because he been drinking and using cocaine.

The night before Ahliyah died, she played at a complex playground with other neighbor children and fell asleep in the living room on the main floor of the apartment. Her disappearance led to a frantic search of the townhome and the complex.

According to the newspaper, Davis admitted kidnapping Ahliyah and taking her to a basement at the apartment block. He said when she would not quiet down, he choked her until she became quiet then he stuffed her body into a clothes dryer.

During the trial, the dryer in which her body was found was wheeled into the courtroom and shown to jurors.

In a handwritten note provided to the Topeka Capital-Journal, Ahliyah's grandmother Sharon Miller wrote: 'Even though Ahliyah will never go to the prom or fall in love, or grow up to have a family, justice has been done to the point that this man will never be able to take another baby’s life, be able to traumatize a family of another victim.'

The note added: 'We all still miss the loss of our beautiful Ahliyah, her touch, her smile, her loving hugs but we as a family know she is in Heaven smiling down on us and is happy now and looks down on us letting us know everything is going to be OK now.'

Davis, who was found hiding in a creek bed, had a violent criminal history and had been placed on probation in another case the week before the killing.

Family members described Davis as an acquaintance of a family friend and said he had been living at the townhome complex at the time of Ahliyah's death. 

Police have said Davis told detectives he kidnapped and choked the girl during a flashback to his military service in Iraq.

The former coroner who performed the autopsy testified that the bruised girl had a tooth knocked out and that she died from asphyxia.
