Convicted murderer and accused paedophile Phillip John Smith has been captured hiding out at an international hostel in Rio, Brazil.

The New Zealand criminal escaped police custody last Thursday while on release from Waikato's Spring Hill prison  into the care of a sponsor, for a three-day visit.

Smith had not tried to change his appearance during his time in Rio and a tip-off from a local who had seen his picture on the TV led to his arrest in the  suburb of Santa Teresa.

The fugitive checked into the Cidade Maravilhosa youth hostel on Wednesday morning, where he shared a room with three other people.

Smith was jailed for life in 1996 for stabbing the father of a Carterton boy he had been molesting to death.

He  sexually assaulted the boy for three years, between 1992 to 1995, before he was caught. 

The fugitive looked relaxed as he handed it his passport. He travelled to Rio, Brazil on hi birth name, Phillip Traynor

It is suspected Smith took a taxi to Auckland Airport, got on a plane to Santiago, Chile, and later flew to Brazil.

His half-sister Joanne Smith had sponsored the release of Smith and drove to the prison on Thursady, only to find hehad already left.

It took Brazilian police  just five hours to arrest the 40-year-old fugitive, once the sighting had been reported.

Smith was led away by officials and has been remanded in custody for 60 days

Smith appeared in court in Brazil this morning and has been remanded in custody for 60 days. 

He is expected to be transferred to Ary Franco prison in Rio immediately. 

The notorious Rio jail was once condemned by the UN for its inhumane conditions.

Smith's lawyer told reporters that his client may start his journey back to New Zealand as early as tomorrow. 

Smith had been sleeping in a six-bed dormitory with three other people for the duration of his stay

He said he was limited to what he could do for his client now that his passport has been cancelled.  

It has been reported that Smith's New Zealand passport has been cancelled and therefore he would have to be deported from Brazil. 

Smith travelled to Brazil with a passport featuring his birth name Phillip Traynor. 

Speaking to Radio New Zealand on Wednesday, Smith said he chose to travel to Brazil because he thought New Zealand authorities would have a hard time extraditing him back to his homeland.

In a statement released to the radio station, Smith claimed nobody helped him escape and he decided to flee the New Zealand to get away from the 'vigilante justice system'.\

Smith said he had used his bachelor of accountancy, bachelor of business studies and his finance major to fund his thought-out escape. 

Speaking at a press conference this morning, Detective Superintendent Mike Pannett told waiting reporters that Smith had shown little remorse or emotion since he was arrested on Wednesday.

'I think he was surprised to see a New Zealand Police officer here,' Mr Pannett said. 

'Having said that he has been very quiet since his apprehension, considering the situation.'

He said Smith, also known by his birth name of Traynor, had been involved in criminal activity since the 1990s.

'We are very greatful to the Brazilian police for their prompt action in the apprehending and we are also greatful for the members of the public in Rio who have shown very good vigilance.' he said.

Speaking to the New Zealand Herald, local journalist Alexandre Tortoriello said the convict had slept in a six-bedroom dormitory room with three other travellers. 

Detective Pannett said Smith did not expect to see New Zealand police in Rio

He also told the paper that Smith nearly convinced one of his room-mates in the hostel to bring him sightseeing in Sao Paulo.

Smith was denied parole from Spring Hill prison in March with the board saying he 'remained an undue risk to the safety of the community'.

The family of Smith's victims had been notified of his escape by police. 

Smith's sister Lyn told Radio New Zealand that she was 'relived' her brother had been found safe. 

She said she hoped he would stay in custody this time.
