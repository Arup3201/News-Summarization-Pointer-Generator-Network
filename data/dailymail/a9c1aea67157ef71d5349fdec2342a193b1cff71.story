This week it's one hundred years since Emily Wilding Davison died at Epsom becoming a martyr for the cause of women's rights.

While her name, and that of Women's Social and Political Union founder Emmeline Pankhurst, have gone down in history, there are countless other women who fought for the cause who have since been forgotten.

Without the spirit and actions of these brave females, British women today wouldn't enjoy many of the freedoms they now take for granted - from being able to vote, to being able to wear what they want.

Hundred year anniversary: Emily Wilding Davison became a martyr for the cause of women's rights after she died from injuries sustained at Epsom

Votes for women: As the founder of the Women's Social and Political Union, Emmeline Pankhurst's name has also gone down in history but her great-granddaughter said the efforts of other women should not be forgotten

Now author Lucinda Hawksley is giving these women a voice again with her new book 'March, Women, March'.

The
books tells the story of the women's movement in Britain from the 
publication of Mary Wollstonecraft's A Vindication of the Rights of 
Women to them finally getting equal voting rights with men in 1928.

Dr
Helen Pankhurst, great-granddaughter of Emmeline Pankhurst, provides a 
foreword to the book in which she calls for the women's movement to be 
remembered beyond her own family's contribution.

She
writes: 'Too often nowadays, the complexity and multi-dimensional 
aspect of the mid-Victorian and Edwardian women’s movement in the UK is 
boxed into a few iconic images and words. High up on the list are the 
Suffragettes, “Purple, white and green”, the Pankhursts, militancy and 
the 'Cat and Mouse Act'.

Influencing fashion: Models Lizzie Siddall and Janey Morris championed for the loose-fitting, long flowing dresses they were painted in by artists like Rossetti to become acceptable wear

Fashion statement: The Rational Dress Movement campaigned for women to wear clothing, like that shown in this engraving from 1882, that freed women from the painful constraints of corsets and cages

WHO KNEW?

The Daily Mail coined the term 'suffragette' to distinguish the militant WSPU activists from the more genteel suffragists of the NUWSS

'These words and images have been 
absorbed into the British psyche and collective memory - they define, 
but in doing so, they also shrink the women’s rights movement. There 
were so many other women who pioneered a whole raft of social, political
and economic changes and who are now largely forgotten. We need to 
remember them.'

Dr  Pankhurst calls on women such as Marion
Wallace Dunlop - who staged the first hunger strike that was to become a
trademark action for the suffragettes - and Lizzie Siddall - who 
campaigned for women to be able to wear comfortable clothing - to be 
remembered.

Ms Hawksley 
explains their contribution to the women's movement, as well as many
others who have since become a footnote in history, in her book.

Fight: Suffragettes endured hunger strikes and force feeding to enable women today to have many of the rights they now take for granted

Deeds not words: Emmeline Pankhurst is arrested outside Buckingham Palace during a demonstration in 1914

Long-term health consequences: Some of the women who were force fed in prison suffered for years to come

Pioneer: Marion Wallace Dunlop was the first to go on hunger strike

Lizzie Siddall was a model for the 
famous Pre-Raphaelite painters but she had brains as well as beauty. 
Along with other women such as America's Amelia Bloomer who shocked 
Victorians by wearing trousers (but didn't actually invent bloomers that
were given her name), she campaigned for women to be able to cast off 
the restrictive national dress of corsets.

Lizzie and Janey Morris championed the loose-fitting, long flowing dresses they were painted in by artists like Rossetti.

Ms
Hawksley writes: 'Both women made their own clothes and were 
influential in creating a style commonly known as Pre-Raphaelite.'

She
adds that in Victorian society, this style of dress was seen as 
'shocking and unseemly' but the women were unrepentant in what they wore
- despite often being sneered at by corset-wearing women.

In 1881, the 'Rational Dress Society' was formed in London protesting against: 'any fashion in dress that either deforms the figure, impeded movement of body or in any way tends to injury health.'

As medical studies began to prove that corsets could intend damage internal organs, the cage crinoline, the bustle and the corset began to fall out of fashion and was no longer required wear for women.

In the early 20th century, the women's movement really began to move a pace as the WSPU began using militant tactics to get noticed including attacking both politicians and property.

As the women began to be imprisoned for their actions, the hunger strikes - for which the suffragettes became synonymous - were born. The suffering of the women who went on hunger strike and were painfully force-fed is well-known but perhaps little known is the women who started it all.

The artist Marion Wallace Dunlop was the first to go on hunger strike after she was arrested for 'wilful damage' in 1909 for attaching a 'bill of rights' to a wall in the palace of Westminster.

Ms Hawksley writes: 'Although the WSPU had not known beforehand that Wallace Dunlop would start this form of protest, the union rapidly adopted it as its own.'

Fight for justice: Lucinda Hawksley's book chronicles the women's rights movement

The book relates in shocking detail the degrading and painful form the force-feeding took for the women on hunger strikes with many suffering from long-term health problems as a result.

But suffragette Annie Kenny summed up the feeling after she was released from prison for  disrupting an election rally. 'They have not tamed us,' she said. 'We have more fire in us than ever before.'

In her book, Ms Hawksley fully explores the impact the Pankhursts and Davison had on the progress of women's rights but she also writes about lesser known heroic figures who fought social and political injustice.

For instance, writer Caroline Norton fought the legal system to obtain a divorce from her abusive husband - and in doing so changed for the better the laws that govern divorce and child custody today. She was instrumental in the passing of the Custody of Infants Act 1839, the Matrimonial Causes Act 1857 and the Married Women’s Property Act 1870; she also helped to change the laws governing working women’s rights.

Meanwhile, feisty widow Dora Montefiore fought not only the archaic laws concerning the guardianship of children, but also began the hugely successful campaign: ‘No taxation without representation’.

Dr Pankhurst sums up the impact all these women made in her foreword. She writes: 'The determination of a few and the persistent support of the many, despite huge setbacks, slowly but surely, led to a transformed British landscape in which “liberty and justice” became more than just a dream.
