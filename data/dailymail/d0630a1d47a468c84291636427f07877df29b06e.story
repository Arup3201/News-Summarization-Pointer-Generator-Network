A prized 1963 Andy Warhol painting that captures the immediate aftermath of a car crash sold for $105 million Wednesday at a New York City auction, setting a record for the famed pop artist.

The 8-foot by 13-foot painting titled Silver Car Crash (Double Disaster) depicts a body sprawled across a car's mangled interior and has only been seen once in public in the past 26 years.

The buyer of the work by the pop art pioneer was not immediately identified by the auction house.

Wednesday's Sotheby's sale beats a previous Warhol auction in 2007 when Green Car Crash (Green Burning Car I) sold for $71.7 million.

Andy Warhol, who died in 1987, famously said that everyone is famous for 15 minutes. But the high price paid for his work at the auction shows that his fame has more longevity

Andy Warhol has created many instantly recognisable images of pop-culture people or items.

The high bidding came a day after the most expensive work of art ever sold at auction went for $142.4 million to conclude six minutes of bidding at Christie’s.

The hefty price tag for a 1967 Francis Bacon triptych called Three Studies of Lucian Freud shattered the previous world record — nearly $120 million paid for Edvard Munch’s “The Scream” at a 2012 Sotheby’s sale.

The winning bid went to Acquavella Galleries who it is believed purchased the painting for an unidentified client.

Michael Frahm, a contemporary art adviser and partner at the London-based Frahm Ltd told New York Daily News: 'The demand for seminal works by historical important artists is truly unquestionable, and we will keep witnessing new records being broken.

'This is the ultimate trophy hunting.'

Christie’s said Tuesday’s sale brought in more than $691.5 million, the highest total for any single auction in history.
