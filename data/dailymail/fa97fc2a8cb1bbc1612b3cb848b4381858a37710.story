The Foreign Office has advised British tourists travelling to Paris to be ‘especially vigilant’ following this week's shootings, issuing a warning over the possibility of indiscriminate attacks across the city.

The shootings that killed 12 people at the Charlie Hebdo office on January 7 were followed by a shootout involving hostages at a supermarket in Porte de Vincennes. A gunman also shot and injured people in Montrouge.

‘There is a high threat from terrorism,’ the Foreign Office advised British travellers on its website.

Security at popular tourist attractions in Paris, including the Eiffel Tower, has  been bolstered

‘Attacks could be indiscriminate. You should be especially vigilant at this time and follow the security advice issued by the French authorities.’

Despite the alerts, French tourism chiefs are confident British travellers will continue to visit Paris to ‘show solidarity’.

The country’s tourist board also warned that tourists needed to remain vigilant, while the region is still currently on an ‘attack alert’ level of security.

Security at popular tourist attractions has also been bolstered.

In a statement released yesterday the French Tourist board said it hoped British travellers ‘will continue their visits to Paris and thereby show solidarity and not let these horrible attacks defeat us. As it has been said elsewhere, Fraternité is as important as Liberté.

‘Travellers should act responsibly, take extra care and follow any security advice from the French authorities.’

The Paris tourist board said that ‘all sites, notably tourist attractions that require extra security are part of the plan’

It added that it ‘unites with the Paris city council authorities to condemn this horrifying attack and to assure visitors that everything will be done to ensure their safety.’

Londoners yesterday insisted they would continue travelling to Paris despite the increased security threat.

Eurostar passengers boarded trains at St Pancras today amid armed police patrols and beefed-up border checks.

Jack Churchland, 32, a plumbing company director from Clapham, said he and his wife Rowena, 40, had decided to travel with their two young children because they believed Paris was no more dangerous than London.

He told the Evening Standard: ‘It's a pre-booked trip we had planned for a while. Obviously when we saw what had happened we did think “maybe we shouldn't go”. But we live in London. It's a dangerous city too. Paris is a big place that now has additional security and I am sure we can avoid any trouble.’

Chris Rowlands, 32, a plant mechanic, had booked a surprise birthday trip to Paris for his partner Lauren Sayers, 29, a psychologist. He said: ‘I only told her we were going a few hours ago. I was worried she wouldn't want to go. Obviously it's scary but these kinds of attacks are more common now.’

Matthew Salfarlie, 39, an accountant from Kentish Town who used to live in Paris, was going to visit friends for the weekend. He said: ‘I never thought of cancelling and it won't affect my plans. It shouldn't deter us otherwise the attackers will have succeeded in terrorising us. After 7/7 I went to work the next day on the Tube. I was a bit nervous but I thought it was important to carry on as normal.’

It comes as the United States issued a global travel warning after recent terror attacks in France, Australia and Canada.

Issued by the State Department, the warning states that violent attacks involving Americans are becoming more common.

‘Recent terrorist attacks, whether by those affiliated with terrorist entities, copycats, or individual perpetrators, serve as a reminder that US citizens need to maintain a high level of vigilance and take appropriate steps to increase their security awareness,’ the alert reads.

The alert does not reference any particular events specifically, but does make note of ‘increasingly prevalent’ kidnappings and hostage situations around the world.

Last year, a gunman killed a soldier near Canada's parliament while a hostage situation in Sydney, Australia left two innocent people dead.

Additionally, the State Department noted that ‘reprisal attacks’ from the Islamic State against the US and its coalition partners are more likely to take place overseas.

The extremist group has promised to strike back against the US for trying to destroy the group, which has currently taken over wide swathes of Iraq and Syria.

‘In response to [US] airstrikes, the Islamic State called on supporters to attack foreigners wherever they are,’ the warning reads. ‘Authorities believe there is an increased likelihood of reprisal attacks against US, Western and coalition partner interests throughout the world, especially in the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, and Asia.’

Americans are reminded that militants routinely kidnap Westerners hoping to earn a ransom for their return, and that various public transportation systems could be at risk. The State Department also said that US government buildings overseas will be on high alert.
