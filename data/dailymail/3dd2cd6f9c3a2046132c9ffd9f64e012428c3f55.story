An illuminated American flag which is attached to the top of a tree in an Idaho park will be left there because officials don’t know how to get it down.

The flag was affixed to the top of a tall pine tree in the Idaho Panhandle National Forest near milepost 27 of the I-90 on the Fourth of July Pass in northern Idaho.

It is thought that it was put up about a month ago but it is too dangerous to remove, according to the U.S. Forest Service.

Jay 
Kirchner a spokesman for Idaho Panhandle National Forest told the Coeur 
d'Alene Press: ‘We have no idea how it got up there.’

‘It's on the tip-top of the tree and I can't imagine it would hold the weight of a person holding onto it.’

The flag, which becomes illuminated at nights is easily visible from the I-90 highway.

However, it is not known how it got there or who put it onto the tree.

Mr Kirchner said the agency sent professional tree climbers to remove it but it was so high and attached to such a small part of the tree that it was difficult to get it down.

He added: ‘It's just too dangerous for them. To get up on that skinny part of the tree that high up would just be too risky.

‘Since it's not hurting anything, we are going to leave it up there for now. It's not worth the risk.’

Mr Kirchner said he would prefer that the flag and light be taken down at some point.

‘We applaud and respect this individual's display of patriotism,’ he said.

‘But they did this on public land and we don't want more people putting up displays on public land.’

There have been other incidents involving American flags on public buildings in recent months.

Last month, two German artists replaced the flags on top of the Brooklyn bridge with white flags they had hand-stitched stars and stripes onto.

Mattias Wermke, 35, left, and Mischa Leinkauf, 37, claimed responsibility for the stunt and have since returned the two American flags to U.S. embassy officials in Germany.
