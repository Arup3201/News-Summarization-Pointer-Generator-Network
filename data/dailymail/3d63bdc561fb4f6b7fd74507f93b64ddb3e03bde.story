Jailed singer Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, a member of the Russian protest band Pussy Riot, has vanished in the country’s vast penal system, say her worried family.

The 23-year-old opponent of Russian president Vladimir Putin was moved after complaining about conditions at her previous jail in Mordovia, south-east of Moscow, but her whereabouts are now unknown.

Her father Andrey said last night: ‘We don’t even know which part of Russia she is now in. This is a kidnap.’

Vanished: Nadezhda Tolokonnikova was jailed in 2012 after a protest against Vladimir Putin

The singer was jailed for two years after a protest in 2012.

In September, Tolokonnikova went on hunger strike in protest at what she called murder threats and 'slave labour conditions' in the penal colony.

Tolokonnikova's husband Pyotr Verzilov also said his wife had not been heard from since she left the camp, some 250 miles from Moscow, on October 22.

He said: 'We have not heard from Nadezhda for 13 days now.

'We believe that the prison service has chosen this peculiar method to punish her.'

He added that according to sources Tolokonnikova was known to be passing through the city of Chelyabinsk in the Urals last month.

Supporters on Saturday picketed the headquarters of the prison service in Moscow.

The Federal Service for the Execution of Punishment has confirmed that Tolokonnikova was being transferred to another colony but refused to give details.

Voina said on Twitter that the prison service said Tolokonnikova's whereabouts would be revealed 'later.'

Tolokonnikova and her bandmate Maria Alyokhina are serving a two-year sentence for their punk group's performance in a Moscow church criticising President Vladimir Putin and the Russian.
