Foam rubber might not be the obvious choice of material for a bookshelf but for Dutch designer Dewi van de Klomp, it has proved to be perfect.

The designer, who is based in Utrecht, has created a series of 'soft cabinets' which work much like normal ones but change shape depending on what you put in them.

The heavier the books, curios or trinkets, the more her amazing Dali style creations appear to be melting.

Metamorphosis: The cabinet looks innocuous without books but transforms once they are added

Dewi, who says her work was inspired by the look of protective foam spray, says that the cabinets are an attempt to persuade people to see the cheap and cheerful material in a whole new light.

'Foam rubber is a well known material but doesnâ€™t get the attention that it deserves,' Dewi explained to MailOnline.

'With the Soft Cabinets, I am trying to increase the value [of foam rubber] through an unusual use of the material.

'I wanted to show the material in its pure form without a covering and embrace the [visible] changes in the material caused by use and time.'

Young talent: Dewi, who is based in the Dutch city of Utrecht, will show her cabinets at Dutch Design Week

Choices: The limited edition cabinets come in a choice of sizes and a range of different colours

Although the cabinets will not go on 
sale until the end of the year, they will be displayed at Dutch Design 
Week in Eindhoven at the end of October.

The cabinets, of which a limited number will be made, come in a range of colours including turquoise, green and Dewi's favourite, blush pink.

'My love for the material grew after seeing a piece of pink foam rubber and increased after a visit to a producer, called Recticel,' Dewi explains.

'I'm not professor in a laboratory who is looking for the newest technology - I look at what already exists. I'm fascinated by details that are unnoticed or forgotten.'

Variety: Each cabinet is unique with the eventual look dependent on what is stored in it
