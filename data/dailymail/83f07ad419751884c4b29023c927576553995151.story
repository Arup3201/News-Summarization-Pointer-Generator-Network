Despite the royal birth in the UK and the controversy President Obama's health reforms caused in the U.S., the person most commonly talked about across the web in 2013 was Pope Francis.

The Catholic figurehead was so popular over the past year online, his Twitter handle @ponitfex was also the fourth most used word.

These results come from research by The Global Language Monitor (GLM) - a Texas-based analytics firm that uses online tools to track and scan conversations on blogs, social networks and news sites.

Cambridge Kate Middleton, pictured right, was the highest scoring

GLM’s Word of the Year 
rankings are based on how many times certain words, phrases and names 
were used online throughout English-speaking countries.

To make the list, a word, name or 
phrase had to have been used a minimum of 25,000 times, appeared in 
various forms of media, and were not specific to a particular country, 
profession or social group.

Names included the names of people, but also businesses, societies and groups.

According The Global Language Monitor the most commonly used word in 2013 was '404', which refers to a technical error code

‘404 has gained enormous attention across the world this year as systems in place since World War II, which many see as the beginning of the contemporary era, are in distress or even failure,’ said Paul JJ Payack, President and Chief Word Analyst of the Global Language Monitor. 

‘The recent ObamaCare launch debacle in the U.S is only a representative example of a much wider system fail, from the political deadlock in the U.S Government, to the decline of the dollar, to the global web of intrigue and surveillance by the NSA, to the uncertainty regarding the European Union, and the on-going integration of China and other rising powers, such as India and Brazil into the global economic system.

‘Our top words, phrases and names this year represent some five continents, which continues to confirm the ever-expanding nature of the English language.’

GLM also looked at the top words of the decade, these came out as Global Warming, 9/11, Evacuee, and Derivative; Google, Surge, Chinglish, and Tsunami followed.

Climate Change was top phrase while Heroes was the top name.
