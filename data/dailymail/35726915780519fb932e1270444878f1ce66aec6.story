British troops involved in the Bloody Sunday killings should be given an amnesty from prosecution as terrorists have been, a former Northern Ireland Secretary said yesterday.

Peter Hain spoke out after it emerged that nearly 200 suspected IRA terrorists had received 'comfort letters' assuring them they were no longer being sought by police.

An Old Bailey judge ruled last week that John Downey would not be prosecuted for the 1982 Hyde Park terror blast, which left four soldiers dead, because he had effectively been given immunity as part of the peace process.

It came as police in Northern Ireland began erecting billboards appealing for witnesses to come forward for a new criminal investigation into Bloody Sunday.

It is 42 years since soldiers from the Parachute Regiment opened fire when a civil rights march in the Bogside, a nationalist area of Derry, descended into rioting.

Fourteen people died and 12 were seriously wounded.

The Police Service of Northern Ireland launched a new murder investigation after the 2010 Saville Inquiry into the killings was heavily critical of the Army.

The complex probe is expected to last four years and could lead to criminal prosecutions of veteran paratroopers.

Mr Hain, a Labour grandee who served as Ulster Secretary from 2005 to 2007, yesterday defended  giving amnesties to terror fugitives, insisting it paved the way for the IRA declaring an end to its war and the decommissioning of weapons.

But he said the same should apply to paratroopers who were involved in Bloody Sunday.

He said: 'Difficult as I know it is for victims on all sides, I see no point in endlessly searching for evidence for crimes committed so many years ago in the Troubles and which is increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to get given the passage of time.

'If you have addressed the question of former terrorists involved in activity, then it should apply even-handedly right across the board to members of the British security forces as well.'

Mr Hain said his attempts in 2005 to introduce laws to extend immunity from prosecution to soldiers as well as Republican and Loyalist terrorists were scuppered by Sinn Fein and the SDLP.

He added that attempts to prosecute paratroopers responsible for the deaths would divert police resources away from catching renegade Republicans still carrying out terror attacks.

Sinn Fein's Raymond McCartney said Mr Hain's remarks were 'ill-judged and inappropriate'.

He said some families 'wish to seek prosecution against those responsible for the death of  their loved ones'.
