Sometimes little feet get tired and need a bit of help from mum - even if those little feet happen to belong to a polar bear.

So it's lucky this particular mama bear was willing to be the cub's ride for the day. 

This adorable pictures is just one of the photos captured by photographer David Jenkins, who spent 10 years capturing the bond between newborn and mother.

The heartwarming images are sure to melt even the coldest of hearts

Three can certainly be a handful - so it is no surprise this mother is grabbing a few minutes shut-eye

Mr Jenkins was able to take the amazing shots of the bears in Wapusk National Park's 'denning area' - where the mother polar bear goes to give birth - after being awarded a special licence, only available to the very best wildlife photographers.

The Irish photographer, 42, caught the youngsters exploring their snowy worlds for the first time as their watchful mothers looked on.

 But if the experience wasn't special enough, Mr Jenkins even managed to capture such magical moments as seeing a mother with three surviving cubs - a very rare occurrence.

Pregnant polar bears build their dens in snowdrifts along mountain slopes, hills near sea ice or in banks of snow on the frozen sea, according to Polar Bears International.

The expectant mother - who has fattened herself up during September - scrapes a tunnel into the snow, digging two chambers where she will give birth to her brood towards the end of the year. 

The family will only leave the den in March and April, when the weather gets a bit warmer and the cubs are strong enough to make the trek to the sea ice.

Three cubs is very rare for polar bears, who are more likely to have twins
