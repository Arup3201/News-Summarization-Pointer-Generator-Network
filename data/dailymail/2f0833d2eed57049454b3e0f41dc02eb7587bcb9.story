For the most populous nation on the planet, the Chinese certainly are terrible at football, its most popular sport.

But president Xi Jinping wants to change all that by making it compulsory for children to play, with the aim of turning his country into a football powerhouse.

A massive fan of the beautiful game, he and many of his 1.37 billion countryman are said to be ashamed at the lowly number 88 ranking of the Chinese men's national team, according to The Economist.

The national team's lowly number 88 ranking is a source of shame for many Chinese, including Mr Xi

So, at the end of last month, it was announced football would become a compulsory part of the national curriculum in Chinese schools.

Education official Wang Dengfeng said improving the standard of football in China must 'start with children'.

In 2016 the sport will become an option in the national university entrance exam.

The idea behind this is that parents will be happier to let their children play where they have previously been reluctant on the basis they were wasting valuable time which could be spent studying.

By 2017, the plan is that 20,000 schools will have received new football pitches and training facilities, which it is hoped will create 100,000 new players.

Mr Xi has been a football fan since he played for his school team as a youngster.

He dreams his country will again qualify for a World Cup – they last did so in 2002 but went out after failing to score – will have the opportunity to host the tournament and, most optimistically, will one day win it.

China's leader wants to avoid any more days like June 15 last year, his 60th birthday, when the men's side were thrashed 5-1 by a Thai youth team despite the fact they were playing at home in Hefei, Anhui province.

The team had lost to Uzbekistan and Holland in friendly matches earlier that month, but this was the last straw as fans swarmed around China's Spanish coach, José Antonio Camacho, and smashed cars in protest.

Mr Camacho subsequently resigned.

The country's women's team aren't so bad however – they are ranked 14th in the world and reached the 1999 World Cup final, which they lost to the USA.
