New research shows that the reason these countries are such magnets for love is because it's much cheaper to woo a woman there. 

The currency exchange website Currencyfair researched the cost of a date that included a cocktail for your lover, cinema tickets, a meal and a taxi journey in some of the best-known cities in the world. 

They found that the cheapest place to get all of these is Madrid, where it would cost just £71.40, while in Geneva would cost twice as much, coming in at £169.99.
