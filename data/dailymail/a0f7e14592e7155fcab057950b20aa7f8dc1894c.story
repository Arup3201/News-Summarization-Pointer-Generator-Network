Warning: Prime Minster Julia Gillard has warned of 'uncomfortable truths' as the national inquiry opened in Melbourne today

Justice Pete McClellan chairs a bench of six commissioners who today started a powerful government-appointed inquiry known in Australia as a Royal Commission.

Witnesses can be compelled to testify and risk imprisonment for lying.

The inquiry was unlikely to achieve its deadline set by the government of late 2015 because so many people wanted to give evidence, he said. 

McClellan said he expected at least 5,000 people will want to give evidence, but the actual number could be much higher.

'The task we have is large; the issues are complex,' McClellan said.

'But
we are now in a position to actively begin the work of gathering the 
stories and examining the responses of institutions,' he added.

Prime
Minister Julia Gillard announced the commission in November in the face
of a string of sexual abuse accusations against priests and claims of a
Roman Catholic Church cover-up.

The
New South Wales state government had ordered an inquiry a week earlier 
into allegations of a sexual abuse cover-up by Catholic priests in the 
Hunter Valley region north of Sydney.

Victoria state officials had also begun investigating a separate series of priest sex abuse allegations in their state.

Since the federal inquiry was announced, more than 6,000 people have contacted staff in writing or by phone.

The
government has offered free legal advice to people who want to make 
submissions to the inquiry before public hearings begin after 
September. 

Gillard said the Royal Commission was an important 'moral moment' for the nation. ' she told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio.
