A speech written for President Kennedy which was scooped up out of an aeroplane rubbish bin has come to light.

The speech dates back to the days before JFK became the 35th President of the US and was serving as senator for Massachusetts.

It was found by cleaner Arne Swanson as she tidied an American Airlines plane after he had landed at Chicago Midway Airport in September 1960.

The manuscript was penned by one of JFK's speech writers but has numerous scribbles and annotations from the future president scrawled across the page

'[...We boast to] foreign visitors of our great dams and cities and wealth but not our free religious heritage. We have become missionaries abroad of a wide range of doctrines - free enterprise, anticommunism, and pro-Americanism - but rarely the doctrine of religious liberty.'This is not a party issue.

'It is not a matter of legislation. But it calls for leadership 
dedicated to our Nation's spiritual ideals - leadership inspiring in its
sense of moral values - and leadership passionate in its devotion to 
the American heritage of liberty.

'It calls for a President whose every
utterance will lift the hearts of those around the world who thirst for
power or plenty - but who thirst even more for a leader of conviction 
and courage and compassion.

'And it calls, finally, for a whole 
Nation willing to recapture the spirit of 1847, willing to commit itself
once again to great ends, willing to dedicate itself to the enrichment 
of our society as well as our lives.

'I have called that challenge the New
Frontier - for it represents - not the comforts we seek - but the tasks
we must all perform, if we are to live up to our trust and our 
heritage.

'Tonight I ask the people of Utah to 
join me on that frontier - to work with me, and with Americans of every 
creed and section, in building a still greater Nation - and in building a
world where the strong are just and the weak secure.

'Then - but only then - can we truly heed the command which Brigham 
Young heard from the Lord more than a century ago - the command he 
conveyed to his little band of followers: "Go as pioneers .... to a 
land of peace."

Mrs Swanson took the speech home with her and it remained in her attic for almost 50 years.

It was delivered by JFK at the Mormon Tabernacle in Salt Lake 
City, Utah on September 23, 1960, during his presidential campaign.

It ran to four pages, 
the last of which was found by Mrs Swanson,  and concentrated on the threat
of Communism to world peace and its 'implacable, insatiable, unceasing
in its drive for world domination'.

In it JFK also thanked the Mormons 'for their pioneer spirit, their devotion to culture and learning, their example of industry and self-reliance.'

John F. Kennedy, 1960 Democratic Presidential nominee, thanks the Democratic National Convention for selecting him. Kennedy told the convention: "We shall carry the fight to the people... And we shall win."

JFK was the youngest president elected to office at the age of 43 and served from January 20, 1961, to November 22, 1963 - when he was assassinated in Dallas.

The speech, written on a sheet of yellow lined paper, is set to fetch £3,000.

Max
Hasler, a book and manuscript expert at Bloomsbury auctions in London, 
said: 'It is an early draft of the speech and is very different from the
speech that was actually delivered by Kennedy, presumably that's why it
ended up in the bin.

The speech was found by American Airlines cleaner Arne Swanson after JFK disembarked at Chicago Midway Airport in September 1960

'Arne Swanson worked for American Airlines and her job was to remove all of the waste from the plane.

'She held onto this for quite some time.

'This will likely appeal to collectors of Americana as well as institutions, possibly the Library of Congress.

'He has crossed a few things out and made lots of amendments so he obviously wasn't very happy with it.'

President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, at 12.30pm on November 22, 1963, while on a political trip to Texas to smooth over unrest in the Democratic Party.

State funeral of John F. Kennedy took place in Washington, D.C. over the three days that followed his assassination on Friday, November 22, 1963, in Dallas, Texas

He was shot once in the upper back and killed with a shot to the head.The president was taken to the Parkland Hospital but pronounced dead half an hour later.

Aged just 46, JFK died younger than any US president to date.

Lee Harvey Oswald was arrested for the murder of a local police officer and was subsequently charged with the assassination of Kennedy.

He denied shooting anyone
and claimed he was being made a scapegoat for the murder but was 
himself killed by Jack Ruby two days later before he could be brought to
trial.

The manuscript of JFK's 1960 speech will be offered for sale at the Bloomsbury auction in London on November 29.
