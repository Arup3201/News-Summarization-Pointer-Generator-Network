Brendan Rodgers is considering a major gamble by resting Steven Gerrard for Liverpool’s showdown against Real Madrid.

This is a crucial week for Rodgers, as this Group B game is followed by a date with Chelsea, but he is prepared to leave his captain out of the team on Tuesday. Gerrard has played every minute in the Premier League and Champions League this season but that appears likely to end against the holders.

When asked if Chelsea was the focus for Gerrard, Rodgers said: ‘In Steven’s case, if he is playing on Saturday I have to look at what is the priority for him and us.’

Liverpool’s manager has admitted the Barclays Premier League is his priority but, even so, it is a shock that he is ready to leave out Gerrard, who has made 127 European appearances in his career. 

And the surprise may not end with Gerrard, as Raheem Sterling could also be left on the bench. 

‘If we want to develop, we need to ensure we are in the top four. But we also want to qualify from this group and we will never know if these players can perform if we don’t put them in the team.’

Liverpool spent more than £100m during the summer and Rodgers is looking to see whether Adam Lallana, who cost £23.7m, and £20m winger Lazar Markovic have what it takes to thrive at Anfield. 

Rodgers said: ‘We have spent an awful lot of money on players to come in and give them an opportunity. If at the end of this cycle of games they haven’t performed, they can never say they haven’t been given a chance.

‘Whether it is Real Madrid or Chelsea, I am putting my faith in these players. That is not being pragmatic. It is why you have a squad to come and get results.

Jordan Henderson, who will captain the side in Gerrard’s absence, said Liverpool’s younger players must show they can take the club forward.

Henderson said: ‘He said: 'We have got people criticising us, we know we are not at our best but this is a great opportunity to show that we are a top side.

'We have to show we can put in the performances at the level the club demands.

'We just need to be a bit more ruthless in the final third. We need to be more ruthless and more creative. We are working hard to create chances.

'We feel we are coming to a brilliant stadium and we want to put on a performance.'

And, when asked about Gerrard, Henderson responded: 'He is a massive player for us he is our captain, our leader, role model. Hopefully he will be a big player for many years to come.'

Despite his likely decision to rest Gerrard, Rodgers is adamant his Reds side are heading to Madrid to win. 

'We are certainly not coming here as a team expecting to lose and then look at the other games as games to qualify,' Rodgers said.

'For us, we see it as an opportunity. We still very much have qualification in our hands.

'It is a wonderful arena - one of the iconic football grounds in the world - and, when you come up against the best opponents, that is the challenge and what makes you perform to your best.

'They are probably the best team in the world at the moment and we really look forward to big games.

'We see them as an opportunity rather than a threat to what we are doing.

'The key, even though we know it is tough, is to make sure we are compact and disciplined in our game.

'I think we showed in the previous game, although the score was 3-0, we can still have moments when we can hurt Real Madrid and that will be the idea (on Tuesday).

'There is absolutely no question we have the courage. This is a team and a group of players who have been so brave to take on the challenge I have asked them to.'
