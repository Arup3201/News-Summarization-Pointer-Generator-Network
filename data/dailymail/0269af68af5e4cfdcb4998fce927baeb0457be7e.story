The two British girls orphaned in the French Alps massacre were away from school without permission, it emerged today.

A teacher had left a worried message on the phone of their father, Saad al-Hilli, just before he was gunned down alongside his wife and mother-in-law and a French cyclist.

All four adults died in blaze of automatic gunfire close to Lake Annecy which also left Mr Al-Hilli's eldest daughter, Zainab, seven, with horrific head and shoulder injuries.

Mysterious message: Investigators found a worried voicemail from a teacher on Saad al-Hilli's mobile phone, left shortly before the family were gunned down in their BMW, pictured, near Lake Annecy in the French Alps

Her four-year-old sister, Zeena, survived, apparently by hiding under her mother's corpse on the floor of the family's BMW.

Now detailed analysis of a mobile 
phone belonging to Mr Al-Hilli has uncovered the message from a member 
of staff at the junior school that both girls attended in Claygate, 
Surrey.

'The girls were out of school without
permission, and the teacher was asking why they were late back,' said a
source close to the Anglo-French investigation.

Mr Al-Hilli, 50, his dentist wife 
Iqbal, 47, and his 74-year-old Swedish mother-in-law, Suhaila Al-Allaf, 
were all found dead in the family BMW on September 5.

This was a Wednesday, a day after Zainab and Zeena should have started the new autumn term.

Eric Maillaud, the Annecy prosecutor,
last week revealed how the girls posed for three pictures with their 
parents just 33 minutes before the atrocity was first reported.

The attack also claimed the life of Sylvain Mollier, a 45-year-old French father-of-three who was hit by at least five bullets.

Mr Al-Hilli was involved in a dispute
with his brother, Zaid, over their father's will, and had changed the 
locks on the family home before they went on holiday to keep his sibling
out.

The prosecutor said that there was 
particular interest in a bank account in the nearby Swiss city of Geneva
in Mr Al-Hilli's name.

Believed to contain around three-quarters-of-a-million pounds, it is 
thought to be linked to the will the Al-Hillis were arguing about.

Aerospace engineer Mr Al-Hilli also kept an illegal Taser defence weapon at home - suggesting that he lived in fear of attack.

Detectives will now have to try and 
establish whether his decision to keep the girls out of school may have 
been related to such concerns.

There is also a message on his 
retrieved mobile phone in which a campsite for the family's caravan is 
discussed, but no other 'significant data' has emerged, said the same 
investigating source.

Both Zainab and Zeena are now back in
Britain and being kept at a secret location.

The eldest child has not 
yet provided any important clues as to the identity of the killer, or 
killers, and as the days pass, psychologists fear it is increasingly 
unlikely that she will.

Police also revealed today that they 
are looking for a motorcyclist who was seen in the vicinity of the crime
scene at around 4pm - within half an hour of the killings.

A local farmer said he saw the rider looking 'unsure of the route', and struggling to manoeuvre his bike over pot-holed roads.

The family left Europa after two nights and moved to the La Solitude du Lac campsite, which overlooks Lake Annecy

Brett Martin, a 53-year-old 
Englishman who used to be in the RAF, was the first to arrive at the 
scene of the carnage on his bicycle.

He has described how he gave first aid to Zainab, who had been shot in the shoulder and beaten savagely around the head.

Prosecutor Mr Maillaud has also 
renewed his appeal for the driver of a green 4x4 vehicle seen speeding 
towards the scene by Mr Martin to come forward, suggesting the car might
have belonged to the national forestry office, the ONF.

As well as the family feud, Mr 
Maillaud said the inquiry was concentrating on Mr Al-Hilli's work on 
satellite systems, and his past life in Iraq, where he was born.

Despite being heavily sedated, Zainab Al-Hilli said she was 'still frightened' by what she saw after coming out of her coma at the CHU hospital in Grenoble
