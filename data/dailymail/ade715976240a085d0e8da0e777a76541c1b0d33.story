Turn up at the doctor’s with a sore throat and you’ll probably be told it’s just a viral infection so antibiotics won’t help, and the best thing is to go home and rest.

I know, because I’ve suffered with a sore throat for as long as I can remember — every day. But it was only last year that the real, and potentially  serious, cause was diagnosed.

It has nothing to do with viral infections, yet millions who suffer from pain or a ‘lump’ in their throat still believe them to be signs of cold or flu and don’t seek medical help.

Laura Topham, pictured here, suffers from GORD, which leaves her with a constantly sore throat that she has had 'since she can remember'

In fact, like me, they could have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GORD), which causes stomach acid to spill up into the oesophagus or gullet. This has been quietly damaging my throat, as the acid — as strong and corrosive as battery acid — inflames, attacks and erodes the gullet’s lining.

Long term, the risk is that the acid changes the cells lining the gullet, and this in turn can lead to cancer.

The root cause of GORD is usually a weakness of the valve between the  stomach and gullet, though some people are simply sensitive to reflux. It can run in families but can also affect anybody, as my diagnosis shows: I am a slim, non-smoking, non-drinking, healthy-eating, thirtysomething female.

So common is the condition — better known as acid reflux — that one in five Britons suffer from it at least once a week, and one in 10 daily.

Many people have what is called silent reflux — meaning they have none of the typical symptoms of heartburn. Instead they may have other symptoms connected to the acid reflux.

‘Around one in 10 have a sore throat. For others the first sign is rotting teeth as the acid is eroding them, or asthma. About 10 per cent of adult asthma is due to reflux, as people inhale little bits of acid, irritating the airways,’ says Shaw Somers, a consultant specialist upper-gastrointestinal surgeon at Spire Bushy and Queen Alexandra NHS Hospital, Portsmouth

Consequently, doctors often miss the signs. Dr Devinder Bansi, a consultant gastroenterologist at the Bupa Cromwell Hospital, says his colleagues in the ear, nose and throat unit often call him in to see ‘respiratory’ patients who actually have acid reflux.

Other common symptoms include heartburn, burping, a bitter taste and regurgitation.

Like many people, I had none of these except a sore throat. I first sought treatment in 2009, following a tonsillectomy that solved my recurrent tonsillitis but not my chronic throat pain.

When it was most sore — a sharp, constant pain, and red, raw appearance lasting several days — I returned to my doctor, who diagnosed pharyngitis (an infection of the throat) and prescribed antibiotics. This happened many times over the next few years, although I generally ignored the low-level discomfort and self-medicated with lozenges, ice lollies and vitamins.

I noticed my throat was most sore when I was tired, hungover or had been up late, so decided it was due to being run-down or alcohol lowering my immune system.

So I stopped drinking, curtailed my late nights, and my throat improved, though after an occasional wedding or hen party I’d always end up with what my doctor diagnosed as an infection.

The correct diagnosis came by accident last year. I happened to see a locum, who asked if I had a sore throat, as I had a vitamin D deficiency. When I said that I always had a sore throat, she insisted I see a throat specialist and referred me.

I arrived at the hospital two months later, unable to imagine anyone resolving my sore throat given that I’d already had a tonsillectomy and been on and off antibiotics for years. The doctor put a camera up my nose and down my throat, then diagnosed GORD; the pain and visible inflammation in my throat was due to acid damage.

I was stunned and protested I’d never had heartburn or indigestion in my life, visualising TV adverts for antacid tablets easing a portly man’s chest-pain after dinner.

But the doctor explained you don’t necessarily feel heartburn — in fact a sore throat or ‘lump in the throat’ is a common symptom. People may also cough or clear their throat constantly, as phlegm is produced to try and counteract the damage.

I was still unpersuaded, so the doctor handed me a list of the main lifestyle culprits. It was basically a list of my favourite treats: tea (I have eight cups a day); dairy (I drink two pints of milk daily); chocolate (at least one bar a day); and eating or drinking late at night. ‘To deal with fat in foods like chocolate and dairy, the body delays stomach emptying in order to emulsify the fat in warm acid,’ says Mr  Somers. ‘That means acid doesn’t clear out the bottom and starts sloshing up the top end.’

Could Laura's love of dairy, chocolate, tea (left) and wine (right) have contributed to her painful throat condition?

Tea, coffee, peppermint and caffeine trigger reflux as they relax the valve, while alcohol and smoking trigger acid release in the stomach lining, meaning you secrete more acid. Acidic foods like fruit juice exacerbate the issue.

Once I’d accepted the diagnosis, I was ecstatic. Suddenly things clicked into place, like why my throat was worse after nights out. Not only is alcohol very acid-producing but I always ate tea and toast before bed to ward off hangovers, so was digesting food horizontally, when gravity is not helping acid remain in the stomach.

To prevent acid reflux you should not eat or drink within three hours of bedtime. I wasn’t run-down or fighting off an infection after all; I’d simply irritated my throat by my behaviour.

It was a revelation to recognise other symptoms too, such as the ‘lump’ in my throat — swelling from the inflammation — and my persistent earache, which had developed in the last year. I was told that nerves that run from the gullet to the brain have an obscure connection to the ear canal.

I also speak so quietly that  people struggle to hear me. ‘Acid reflux can cause a hoarse voice as it inflames the vocal cords,’ explains Mr Somers.

My doctor prescribed omeprazole tablets, twice daily for six months, which she claimed would cure my reflux. Omeprazole is a form of  proton pump inhibitor (PPI), a prescription drug that reduces acid production in the stomach; over-the-counter remedies such as Gaviscon and Rennies neutralise the acid coming up.

My first spell on the pills lasted three weeks, until I became convinced they were making me gain weight. I started the tablets again last autumn when the pain worsened.

But at night the room spun so severely I had to sit up all night — vertigo is a side-effect for around one  per cent of the drug’s users, so I stopped taking it.

However, I recently restarted the tablets, in the morning, resolving the vertigo, as I discovered how serious acid reflux can be.

The first my friend heard of his own acid reflux was when he was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer. He has survived, but has lost much of his stomach and still has major surgery.

Of course, not everyone who has acid reflux gets cancer. But 10 to 15 cent of people with GORD develop a pre-cancerous change in their oesophageal lining, a condition called Barrett’s oesophagus. And one in every 200 patients with Barrett’s oesophagus will develop cancer.

Though the numbers are small, the longer you have acid reflux, the greater the danger, and I could have it for decades.

‘Over time the condition can cause scarring of the gullet, which leads to a narrowing so you can’t swallow. Occasionally it leads to the lining becoming cancerous, so we’re very active in treating young people,’ says Mr Somers.

‘Proton pump inhibitors work for 90 per cent of people and take the sting away, but acid is still going up into the gullet and injuring it; surgery will reduce the risk of cancer much more.’

A private consultant has told me that, to find my best treatment options, I need a gastroscopy — where a camera will be inserted into my oesophagus to investigate the state of my stomach valve.

If it isn’t working, I may require surgery — either traditional internal ‘origami’ to fold the stomach around the weak valve to stop acid splashing up, or the new Linx bracelet, where a ring of tiny magnets is placed around the bottom of the gullet, allowing food through but stopping acid rising up.

In the meantime, as well as omeprazole, I take antacids when the pain intensifies. I also intend to change my diet as I’ve heard it can make a radical difference - but I’m a tea and chocolate addict. If I wasn’t, I might never have felt the reflux in the first place.
