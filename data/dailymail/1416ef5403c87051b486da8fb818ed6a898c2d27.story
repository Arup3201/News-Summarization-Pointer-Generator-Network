Rossi was ordered to pay a £100 fine, £85 court costs and £20 victim surcharge at the hearing

Patrick Rossi did not pay a £100 fine in court because he was too poor according to his lawyers

The son of millionaire Status Quo frontman Francis Rossi was unable to pay a £100 fine when he was banned from driving - because he’s too poor, a court was told.

Patrick Rossi, 23, was arrested just yards from the gated mansion he shares with his father after being caught driving illegally.

He pleaded guilty 'to driving a motor vehicle otherwise than in accordance with a licence authorising you to drive a motor vehicle of that class' and was handed four penalty points.

Rossi was also ordered to pay a £100 fine, £85 court costs and £20 victim surcharge at the hearing today.

But his lawyers claimed he could not pay the sum because he did not get paid for two weeks.

His lawyer Spencer Hilliard told the court: 'Mr Rossi does not have any money here today - might he pay it at £25 a week?'

He was told by magistrates he could pay the fine at £50 a fortnight after they heard he would get his next salary in two weeks.

Rossi was arrested by Croydon police 
while driving a Volkswagen Polo in Upper Woodcote Village, in the Webb 
Estate, at around 12.45am on October 29.

Francis Rossi performs at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland. Status Quo have sold millions of albums

He lives with his father on the exclusive estate in Purley, Croydon.

Lead magistrate Mrs Oastler told him: 'You had points before and knew the seriousness of getting points.'

Mrs Oastler said Rossi would have faced a £150 fine if it had not been for his early guilty plea.
