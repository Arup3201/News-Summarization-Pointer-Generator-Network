A 12-year-old boy is fighting for his life after being shot by a  police officer when he allegedly pulled a BB gun from his waistband outside a recreation center in Cleveland.

The unnamed youngster was spotted 'waving around' the airsoft gun in the playground area next to Cuddell Recreation Center at Detroit Avenue and West Boulevard at around 3.30pm on Saturday.

A concerned man, who was sat nearby, called 911 and told the dispatcher: 'I’m sitting in the park…there’s a guy in here with a pistol, and it’s probably a fake one, but he’s pointing it at everybody.

'The guy keeps pulling it in and out…it’s probably fake, but he’s scaring the s*** out of people.'

Minutes later, two Cleveland Police officers - a rookie and a 10-15 year veteran - arrived at the scene, where they apparently saw the boy pick up the gun from a table and put it in his waistband.

The rookie then asked the boy to put his hands up, at which point the youngster reached into his waistband and pulled out the pistol,  Police Patrolmen's Association President Jeffrey Follmer said.

Despite the 911 caller's prior warning that the gun was likely fake, the officer then fired two shots at the boy, at least one of which hit him in the stomach, according to Cleveland.com.

The victim was rushed to MetroHealth Medical Center, where he underwent surgery on Saturday evening. He is believed to remain in a critical condition.

Police later told Fox 8 the weapon the boy was carrying was 'an airsoft type replica gun resembling a semi-automatic pistol.' They added that the gun's orange safety indicator had been removed.

Union officials claimed the officers - one of whom was later taken to hospital with an ankle injury - acted responsibly amid concerns the boy was in possession of a real gun.

However, Deputy Chief of Field Operations Ed Tomba described the incident as 'very, very tragic', saying that the child did not threaten the officer verbally or physically.

'When an officer gives a command, we expect it to be followed,' Mr Tomba said. 'The way it looks like right now, it wasn't followed, but we're going to continue our investigation.'

Response: Two Cleveland Police officers arrived at the scene following the 911 call. After the boy refused to put his hands up and reached for the gun (pictured from another perspective), one officer fired at him twice

On Saturday evening, members of the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor’s Office were at the scene. Investigators will determine if the officer was justified in shooting the boy.

According to the boy's mother, Samaria Rice, the family lives across the street from the recreation center, which is expected to remain cordoned off on Sunday.

She told Action News 19 the first she heard of the shooting was when two  men came to her home to say her son had been shot. She added that her son did not have access to a gun at the property.

Both officers involved are believed to have been placed on administrative leave in accordance with protocol in officer-involved shooting incidents. An investigation is ongoing.
