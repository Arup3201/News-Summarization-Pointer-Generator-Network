Roy Hodgson worst fears were realised on Sunday as NFL sides the Jacksonville Jaguars and Dallas Cowboys dug up the Wembley pitch less than a week before England's Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia. 

The Cowboys beat the Jaguars 31-17 in front of a packed crowd but mud was seen flying up on a regular basis as the gridiron stars pounded their way around the turf just six days before Hodgson's men are due to play.

The England manager met Wembley executives to voice his worries that his players may be risking injury on that pitch when they face the FIFA-ranked No 36 side.

Although rain fell beforehand the pitch was relatively dry, but dirt visibly flew from the surface when players hit full tilt and as a whole it was clearly in poor condition at the end of four quarters.

This is the second American football game in a fortnight on the field and Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford noted it was 'pretty cut up' last time out - and he doesn't have to worry about the impact a bumpy surface will have on a round ball. 

After inspecting the pitch this week Hodgson said it was 'not in the best of nick' - and that was before the FA announced next year it will host three more NFL games at the stadium.

He had already criticised the scheduling of this match so close to an England game, which he expects should take priority.

'I don't really think you could expect me to say, "Excellent, delighted, well done,", Hodgson said.

'But I'm realistic, I'm pragmatic and this match has been organised for a period of time now. The pitch, unfortunately, is not in the best of nick, which we're all a bit unhappy with. I think it will get put right.

'If asked if it was a good thing or not, I would have to say not. I can do nothing about it and we won't use it as an excuse.

'The ground staff will be working their socks off from Sunday evening through to Saturday to make it as good as it can possibly be and we will accept that and have to adapt.'

After Sunday's match Dallas Cowboys defensive end Jeremy Mincey said of the pitch: 'It was a little muddy and tough but we had our long studs in and adjusted well. There wasn’t much slipping and sliding out there and some guys changed their cleats at half-time.’
