A lucky ticket holder from Britain has come forward to claim the £101 million EuroMillions jackpot, Camelot has revealed.

The life-changing sum is the third-biggest UK payout ever in the European lottery.

The winner has not been named, and it is unknown at this stage whether it is an individual or a syndicate, but it will catapult them into the top 1,000 richest people in the land.

Jackpot jubilation: Biggest-ever EuroMillions winners Colin and Chris Weir, who scooped £161m in July

A spokesman for Camelot said: 'Nothing more will be released about the win until Monday.

'At that point they [the winner] can decide whether they want to go public or remain anonymous, and all our checks will have been carried out and the win verified.'

The jackpot instantly makes them the 703rd richest person in the country – on a par with David Bowie.

They will move ahead of celebrity couples such as Sharon and Ozzy Osbourne and Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin, who have fortunes of £95million and £48million respectively.

The jackpot had been building up after five draws produced no winners.

In July, Colin and Christine Weir won the biggest UK prize in the EuroMillions – an incredible £161millon.

The Scottish couple, who had been married for 30 years, are now almost as rich as the Beckhams.

Scottish couple Colin and Chris Weir scooped the biggest-ever EuroMillions jackpot of £161million earlier this year.

The latest lucky British winner may look to the husband and wife from Largs for inspiration on how to spend their fortune.

Mr and Mrs Weir decided to buy homes for son Jamie, 22, and 24-year-old daughter Carly, a photography student.

They also modestly aimed for driving lessons for them both and said Jamie would probably quit his job at a call centre.

The loaded pair also intended to 
start their own charity and travel to Cambodia, Thailand and Australia, 
where Mr Weir wanted to visit mystical Ayers Rock.

Mr Weird jokily said he wanted to keep his 'reliable' Suzuki SX4 and six-year-old Suzuki Ignis.

But Mrs Weir insisted she wanted a Lexus Prius Hybrid.‘We’ve got the champagne on ice and look forward to welcoming the ticket-holder into the National Lottery millionaires’ club.

A National Lottery spokesman said: ‘This is amazing news – we are absolutely delighted.

'This is the third-biggest winner this country has ever seen and follows hot on the heels of the Weirs.

‘As well as making big winners, 
EuroMillions contributes to the more than £30million raised every week 
by The National Lottery for Good Causes here in the UK.’

Lottery bosses said demand for tickets peaked between 5pm and 7.30pm before the draw as punters rushed to try their luck.

Before
the Weirs, the largest lottery winner in the UK was an anonymous player
who scooped £113million in the EuroMillions last October.

The fourth-biggest EuroMillions prize winner in the UK won £84million last May.

In
February 2010, Nigel Page and Justine Laycock, from Gloucestershire, 
broke the then record with a £56million win – now the fifth-biggest 
prize in the history of EuroMillions. 

The sixth-biggest payout went to Les and Sam Scadding in South Wales who won £45millon in November 2009. 

Subject to checks, the prize can be paid out as early as Monday morning when the banks open their doors.

The millionaires will now be able to buy six of the world’s most expensive watches – a diamond-encrusted timepiece from Chopard costing £15millon each.

Or they could treat themselves to 720 pairs of the world’s most expensive shoes – the £140,000 diamond-encrusted heels made by the House of Borgezie.

They could also buy 600 top-of-the-range sports cars – the Ferrari 458 Italia costs a mere £170,000.

For a party to celebrate the win, they could easily afford Barbadian singer Rihanna, who charges £500,000 for a performance.

But if they wish to avoid long-lost family members who are no doubt set to come out of the woodwork, the winners could escape to their own private island, such as £100million Rangyai near Phuket in Thailand.

The 110-acre private island boasts white beaches as well as tropical forests.
