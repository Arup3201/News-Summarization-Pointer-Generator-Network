A luxury real estate agency has turned to drone technology to reel in top buyers for a $6.1 million Connecticut mansion.

Halstead Property is one of a slew of high-end realtors who've begun using the remote controlled copters to capture the most captivating photos and video possible from inside and around America's finest homes.

The five bedroom Greenwich, Connecticut estate is the most recent of some 200 homes Halstead has marketed using the technology.

Marketing drones: This $6.1 million Georgian-style Connecticut mansion has gotten the drone treatment. Luxury real estate firm Halstead Properties uses the technology to take video that creates an experience more than simply an impression

'We’re not selling $150,000 homes with this technology,' Matthew Leone, the director of web marketing for Halstead, told the New York Times.

Instead, Halstead and firms like them are giving the most elite of potential buyers the red carpet treatment in an effort to entice them into cutting a check.

The drones are set aloft with cameras in tow. They capture the interior and exterior of homes from angles impossible to reach with average cameras, but which give an experience when viewed online rather than just a glimmer of what the place is like.

Calling in the drones: The camera-toting drones were used at the Greenwich, Connecticut home after it sat on the market a little longer than expected

Real estate envy: Halstead has created about 200 of the gorgeous real estate videos and one has even gained 500,000 views on its website

'Multimillion-dollar homes demand Madison Avenue marketing and advertising, not Main Street,' Leone said.

The Georgian-style Connecticut estate has five bedrooms, four wood-buring fireplaces, and heated pool and sits atop two majestic New England acres.

The drone-produced video was taken in and around the mansion after it received a lot of interest, but no buyer, after hitting the market in October.

Rather than be relegated to a one-dimensional slide show of what rooms look like, the video is a tour of how the home feels.

Experiential: The drones allow real estate agents to create visual experiences of a home rather than just a series of pictures. Video of this Darien, Connecticut mansion--with its stunning seaside view and gorgeous swimming pool--has been viewed 500,000 times on the Halstead website

'We¿re not selling $150,000 homes with this technology,' says Halstead's Matthew Leone. This Connecticut home listed for over $7 million

Another such video, of a $7.6 million home in nearby Darien, Connecticut, has been viewed an astonishing 500,000 time on the Halstead website.

The use of drones has become the norm in the industry as their prices has gone down.

What once would have been a production requiring professional camera crews and many thousands of dollars can now be done with a $500 drone.

Halstead initially used the drones merely for still photos, but the improved technology and cost effectiveness have allowed them to start producing the slick videos.

'Multimillion-dollar homes demand Madison Avenue marketing and advertising, not Main Street,' said Leone
