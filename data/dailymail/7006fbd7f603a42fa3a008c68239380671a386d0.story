Hearing: An inquest has heard how Erena Louise Wilson (pictured), who was killed by a falling branch, may not have died if the trees had been properly pruned

An accounts manager who was hit by a falling branch at the Royal Botanic Gardens may not have been killed if the tree had been pruned properly, a hearing heard yesterday.

Erena Wilson, 31, died instantly when she was struck on the head by a 12inch-thick branch from a Lebanese cedar while she was strolling with two friends.

Rain and gusts of winds of up to 30mph had been sweeping around the gardens just before the branch fell.

Miss Wilson’s two friends ran when they heard a crack ‘like thunder’, but when they looked back they found her lying on the ground covered in branches.

West London Coroner’s Court yesterday heard that it was a ‘fluke’ that only one person was killed or hurt at Kew Gardens, West London, in September last year.

The pre-inquest hearing was told either under-pruning or a phenomenon known as ‘summer branch drop’, in which trees struggling to absorb water shed their branches, may have caused the fall.

Assistant Coroner Elizabeth Pygott said the probe should focus on whether proper trimming of the trees may have prevented the branch crashing onto Miss Wilson.

‘There is the question of whether pruning the trees may have prevented the fall from happening’, she said.

John McLinden QC, representing Miss Wilson’s family, said that Kew Gardens may not have had a policy to deal with the dangers of summer branch drop.

He told the hearing: ‘Kew recognised the danger of summer branch drop and the implementation of it did not occur.

‘Did Kew ever warn members of the public of summer branch drop and did they cease those warning? Did they take precautions by cordoning off areas and did they cease doing that as well?’

Scene: John McLinden, representing Miss Wilson's family, said if summer branch drop did cause the branch to collapse then Kew Gardens would need to take further measures to protect the public

Mr McLinden added that if summer branch drop did cause the branch to collapse on Ms Wilson then Kew Gardens would need to take further measures to protect the public.

‘Kew is not only a World Heritage Site but a public body - it is virtually a public park that has visitors exceeding one million a year’, he added.

‘There is a public interest for people to know about this dangerous phenomenon.’

Ms Wilson, who was originally from New Zealand and lived in Ealing, west London, worked as an account manager for Deluxe Digital Studios.

Speaking outside of court, Miss Wilson’s uncle, Pieter van Vliet, said the family wanted the issue of summer branch drop to be explored during the inquest to prevent further deaths.

‘We’re not experts but obviously Kew Gardens has trees, a lot of them, so potentially there is a good reason for bringing this up,’ he said.

Mr van Vliet, 49, said his niece was a regular visitor to Kew, and added that the family would be ‘forever grateful’ for the support given to them by the gardens, including hosting a memorial event.

Her mother Liz Shelley, 54, flew over from the family home in Auckland after her death and held an emotional meeting with workers at Kew Gardens.

Focus: Assistant Coroner Elizabeth Pygot said the inquest should focus on whether proper trimming of the trees may have prevented the branch falling on to Miss Wilson (pictured)

She said yesterday from New Zealand: ‘For the first few weeks I had so many questions, back then I would not have let the inquest come to an end.

‘Then I came to Kew and I saw the staff cry, they were devastated. That changed everything. I could see I wasn’t alone in questioning what had happened and this had happened despite good people trying their very best.’

Kew Gardens was closed to the public after her death and remained shut the following day after severe weather warnings.

The investigation has been passed from the police, who found no suspicious circumstances, onto the Health and Safety Executive.

The hearing continues.
