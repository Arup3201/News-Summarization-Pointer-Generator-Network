USA's heart-breaking 2-1 defeat by Belgium in extra-time on Tuesday was watched by more than 21 million people in America, more than the baseball's World Series and the NBA Finals.

Jurgen Klinsmann's team captured the imagination of the American public, but their World Cup run came to an end in the last 16 when they were undone by Belgium in Salvador.

After almost 25 million people tuned in to see their dramatic 2-2 draw with Portugal in Manaus, a game played on a Sunday night in a primetime slot, Reuters report that viewing figures for the clash with Belgium were just shy of that mark.

Disney-owned network ESPN confirmed that it was the second highest rated men's football game, with about 16.5 million viewers, and that a record 1.1 million viewers streamed via the app WatchESPN.

In addition, Spanish-language network Univision said 5.1 million tuned in to their broadcast of the gripping clash in Salvador, taking the total viewers to over 21 million.

In comparison, Boston Red Sox clinching the MLB World Series last year was watched by 19 million people, while last month's NBA Finals between San Antonio Spurs and Miami Heat averaged 15.5 million viewers.

While those figures show progress for football in the States, there is still a long way to go before it can compete with the popularity of American football. This year's Super Bowl in February between the Seattle Seahawks and Denver Broncos drew in more than 111 million US viewers.
