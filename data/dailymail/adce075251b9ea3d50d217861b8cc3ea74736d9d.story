Disney theme parks make up four of the world’s top 20 tourist attractions, according to new research.

Disney World’s Magic Kingdom in Orlando, Florida, Tokyo Disneyland, Disneyland Park in California and Tokyo DisneySea registered a total of more than 66 million visitors last year.

The destinations are among 15 theme parks included in a list of the world’s top 50 tourist attractions compiled by tourism website Travel + Leisure.

The most popular tourist destination across the globe last year was Istanbul’s Grand Bazaar, which recorded 91.25m visitors in 2013

The most popular destination across the globe was Istanbul’s Grand Bazaar, which recorded 91.25m visitors in 2013.

The 15th century market is famous for its hand-painted ceramics, lanterns, intricately patterned carpets, and Byzantine-style jewelry. 

Mexico City’s The Zócalo - the ceremonial Atzec plaza - came in second place with 85 million visitors, while New York’s Times Square was third in the list with 50 million.

The Zocalo hosts military parades, cultural and political events, concerts, exhibitions, fairs, and public art installations, while Times Square is known for it lively entertainment, Broadway shows and many shops. 

Disney World’s Magic Kingdom in Orlando, Florida recorded 18.6 million visitors last year making it the 12th most visited tourist attraction in the world

Other attractions that made up the top ten were New York's Central Park, and Union Station in Washington D.C. which both attracted 40m visitors. 

The Las Vegas Strip came in sixth position followed by Tokyo's Meiji Jingu Shrine and Sensoji Temple.

Niagara Falls was in ninth place while New York City's Grand Central Terminal was in tenth position with 21.6m visitors.

There was no place on the list for any British attractions, and the least visited place in the top 50 most popular tourist destinations was the Taj Mahal, which still recorded between seven and eight million tourists. 

It means the British Museum in London (6.7 million), the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (6.3 million), and the Roman Colosseum (5.1 million) narrowly missed the cut.

Nevada's Las Vegas Strip attracted 30.5m annual visitors in 2013, making it the sixth most popular destination

The figures were compiled from data supplied by government agencies and industry reports including the Global Attractions Attendance Report.

The attractions themselves also supplied their own data when ticket sales weren’t available.

Travel + Leisure defined tourist attractions as ‘cultural and historical sites, natural landmarks, and officially designated spaces’.

It meant that while destinations such as the Las Vegas Strip made the list, popular spots such as malls and shopping centres were not included, despite often attracting tens of millions of visitors each year.

Beaches and religious sites were also omitted.

Niagara Falls in New York and Ontario registered 22m visitors, placing it ninth in the top 50 tourist attractions

Bourbon Street in New Orleans was 45th in the list of the world's top 50 destinations with 7,470,000 visitors

The publication of the list comes shortly after the World Tourist Organisation published their annual report earlier this year detailing the state of global tourism.

It revealed there was a five percent growth in international tourism in 2013, which amounted to an additional 52 million tourists and which brought the total up to 1.087 billion.

The growth defied predictions that the global economic downturn would slow tourism.

Regions that showed the biggest growth in international tourism in 2013 were Asia, Africa and Europe.

Of these areas, Southeast Asia, Central and Eastern Europe and North Africa were the most popular places to visit.

The Taj Mahal in India recorded between seven and eight million visitors in 2013 putting it in 50th position

The Great Wall of China had 10.7m visitors in 2013, making the historic attraction the 26th most popular site

The Palace of Versailles, in France just made it onto the list with 7,527,122 tourists visiting the site last year

The Forbidden City in Beijing attracted an astonishing 15,340,000 in 2013, making it the 16th most popular tourist attraction in the world last year

The Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee had 9,345,695 in 2013

Europe currently remains the most visited region in the world, welcoming an extra 29 million visitors last year to attract a total of 563 million tourists – 52 percent of the entire tourist market.

Northern, Southern and Central America saw an increase of six million visitors to reach a total of 169 million.

Africa attracted three million more arrivals than 2012, reaching a new record of 56 million.

Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Mexico City, recorded 20 million tourists in 2013, putting it in 11th place

The list of top 50 travel destinations also revealed that South Korean theme parks Everland and Lotte World were among the most visited attractions, beating the Eiffel Tower with nearly seven million, the Great Pyramids with nearly four million and Stonehenge with one million.

Travel + Leisure noted that accessibility can be a factor in determining how many visitors visit a particular attraction, adding that it takes extra effort to reach destination’s such as Yellowstone National Park, which recorded 3.2 million visitors, the Terracotta Army in Xi'an, China, which had 4.8 million, and Peru’s Machu Picchu, which has restricted tourism to 2,500 entries per day, or 912,500 per year.
