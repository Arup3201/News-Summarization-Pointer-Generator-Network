The innovators behind Google, Facebook and eBay were among the men and women named the biggest American donors for 2014.

According to The Chronicle of Philanthropy's annual list of top 50 donors, tech tycoons led the pack last year when it came to giving to a good cause. 

Of the combined $9.8billion given to charity by the top philanthropists, 47 per cent came from leaders in the technology industry - including Microsoft founder Bill Gates.

New money: Tech tycoons like WhatsApp founder Jan Koum (pictured) donated more than $4.5billion to charitable causes last year, according to a new ranking of top American donors

More popular: Spending on charitable causes went up 27.5 per cent compared to last year, when it increased just 4 per cent

Gates and his wife Melinda took back the top spot on the list for the first time in ten years, with their generous investment of $1.5billion into their own foundation.

Also appearing in the top-five donors is founding Facebook president Sean Parker and WhatsApp creator Jan Koum. 

Koum sold his mobile texting app to Facebook last year for an astonishing $19billion, and just eight months later he donated $556million of his newfound fortune to the Silicon Valley Community Fund. 

Twelve of the top 50 philanthropists made their fortunes in technology, making their field the most represented on the list. That's a sea change to the previous year when just six of the biggest donors were from Silicon Valley.

In the top five: Buffalo Bills owner Ralph Wilson (left) represents some of the more established donors on the list. On the right is Ted Stanley who made his fortune in marketing. He donated $650 million to mental health research last year, inspired by his son's own struggle with bi-polar disorder

Other tech tycoons on the list include GoPro camera founder Nicholas Woodman and his wife Jill ($500million), Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page ($382 and $177million, respectively), eBay founder Pierra Omidyar and his wife Pam ($180million) and SalesForce.com founder Marc Benioff and his wife Lynne ($154million). 

The new influx of donations from the tech sector could make a huge difference in the charities they patronize,  since experts say they tend to me more active donors. 

Take Parker for example. Last year he put $550million in a donor-advised fund and almost immediately bequeathed $24million from the sum to Stanford University for allergy research. 

'This younger generation is putting their money toward philanthropy now, compared with the older generation like Bill Gates and Paul Allen, who did it later in their careers,' the Chronicle of Philabthropy's Maria DiMento told the San Francisco Chronicle. 'The question is now, where are they going to direct it.'
