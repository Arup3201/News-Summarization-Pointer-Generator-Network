Chelsea secured the first major silverware of the season with a 2-0 win over London rivals Tottenham in the Capital One Cup final at Wembley.

John Terry pounced to fire in from close range just before half-time and Diego Costa secured the trophy with his deflected strike after 56 minutes.

Here, Sportsmail's Sam Cunningham rates every player's performance at Wembley.

CHELSEA (4-3-3)

Petr Cech - 7

Huge pressure was on his shoulders after getting the nod ahead of Thibaut Courtois and he was as reliable as Jose Mourinho would’ve expected. Nothing spectacular, but a cup final clean sheet.

Branislav Ivanovic - 7

The full back was in a rare miss shock early on when he headed wide at the back post. Cleverly won the free kick for Chelsea’s opener, controlling John Terry’s long ball well before going down when pulled by Nacer Chadli.

Gary Cahill - 7.5

Completely nullified the threat of Tottenham’s main man Harry Kane. Almost scored with a header, seconds before the break and moments after Chelsea had gone ahead.

John Terry - 8.5

Leading by example as he fired Chelsea ahead just before the break and was equally as solid at the back.

Cesar Azpilicueta - 7

Was in the wars and ended the game with a heavily bandaged up head. Part of an incredibly solid Chelsea back line.

Ramires - 6.5

Solid and reliable performance, if not emphatic. Controlled in defensive midfield alongside an unlikely partner in Zouma and did what was required.

Kurt Zouma - 6.5

Looked out of position in defensive midfield at first but improved vastly.

Eden Hazard - 7.5

The creative cog in Chelsea’s midfield, finding space on the left-hand side and through the middle. Inches wide with an effort in the second-half. As per usual, the target of several fouls.

Cesc Fabregas - 7.5

Quiet first-half, but made his presence felt early in the second by using his chest to flick the ball into the air then execute and audacious overhead kick which almost beat Hugo Lloris then set up Diego Costa for the second.

Willian (substitute for Cuadrado, 76th minute) - 7

Expertly delivered ball into the box for Chelsea’s first-half goal and was on-song throughout against the club he almost signed for. 

Diego Costa (substituted for Drogba, 90th minute) - 8

Dealt the killer blow in the tie with the second goal. At his usual, infuriating best. Involved in early exchanges with Eric Dier, then palmed Nabil Bentaleb in the face.

Subs not used: Courtois, Filipe Luis, Ake, Oscar, Remy.

 TOTTENHAM (4-2-3-1) 

Hugo Lloris - 6

Crucial save to deny Cahill a second just before the break, which would’ve surely buried Spurs, but was powerless to keep out either goal.

Kyle Walker - 5.5

He did not get close enough to Costa in the second half to stop him getting the shot away which then took a deflection off him which wrong-footed Lloris on its way in.

Eric Dier - 5.5

Let Costa rile him in the early stages and picked up a yellow card going through the back of the striker then failed to clear Willian’s free kick to allow Terry to score.

Jan Vertonghen - 6

The calmer of the two heads in Tottenham’s centre of defence and barely put a foot wrong during the match.

Danny Rose - 5.5

Crucial diving header to stop a Chelsea break at speed in the first-half, covering in the centre of defence, then was at fault for conceding the opener by flicking on Willian’s free kick.

Nabil Bentaleb - 5

Contributed little to Tottenham’s performance and picked up a silly yellow card late on for an unnecessary foul.

Mason (substitute for Lamela, 71st minute, 6) - 5.5

Resorted to shooting from distance, going for the spectacular when a more patient approach was needed.

Nacer Chadli (substituted for Soldado, 80th minute) - 5.5

He gave away a foolish foul, pulling on Ivanovic’s arm, which gave Chelsea the free kick they scored the opening goal from.

Christian Eriksen - 6.5

Hit the bar early on with a free kick and was Spurs’ most dangerous player going forward, generating a few openings that Cech dealt with fairly easily.

Andros Townsend (substituted for Dembele, 62nd minute, 6) - 5.5

Too ineffectual down Tottenham’s right-hand side. Tried to get on the ball and run at Chelsea but created little of note.

Harry Kane - 5

Spent the game in Cahill’s back pocket. Spurs fans were desperate for their man-of-the-moment, and top scorer, to run the show, but he was almost invisible.

Subs not used: Vorm, Davies, Fazio, Stambouli.
