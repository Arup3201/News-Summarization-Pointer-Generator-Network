Austin Powers star Verne Troyer was the subject of an intimate search at LAX airport over the weekend.

The 45-year-old actor, who played 'mini 
me' in 1999 film Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, posted a 
snapshot of the search on his Facebook and Twitter pages.

The picture appeared to involve a member
 of the TSA - the Transport Security Administration - looking behind the
 diminutive star's backside as he sat in his wheelchair.

Verne Troyer posted the photo of a TSA agent seemingly searching with the caption: 'TSA Struggles.'

Troyer did not provide a reason for the search, captioning it: 'TSA struggles.'

Troyer's fans reacted with a mix of shock and crude humor.

'They are profiling.  I bet they searched every little person that came through today and that is wrong!!!!' wrote user Allan Volker.

Kerim Akgul joked: 'The look on his face.... Priceless.'

Troyer, who has used a mobility scooter for years though he has full mobility, has publicly struggled with drug and alcohol addiction in the past.

Gawker noted that as full cavity searches are performed in separate rooms, it was likely the pic was just Troyer having a joke.

However Ross Feinstein, press secretary for TSA, told MailOnline that any screening of Troyer was done in line with normal TSA regulations and procedures.  

Troyer rose to fame as the evil Mini-Me in the Austin Powers films

'The screening process for a passenger who uses a 
wheelchair or scooter is determined by their ability to stand and walk,' Feinstein wrote in an email.

'A passenger can be screened without standing, walking, or being 
required to transfer out of a wheelchair or scooter.
 In this specific case, a Transportation Security Officer (TSO) 
conducted a thorough patdown while the passenger remained seated in 
their scooter.

'The screening was in accordance with established TSA 
policies and procedures.'

Since 
appearing in the Austin Powers film, Verne has appeared in a handful of 
films including The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus and The Love Guru.

Earlier this year, he appeared in documentary series Incredibly Small World
