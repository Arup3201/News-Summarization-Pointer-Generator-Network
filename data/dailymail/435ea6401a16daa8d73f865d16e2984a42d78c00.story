Under fire Better Together leader Alistair Darling insisted this morning that Scottish voters would reject independence

Better Together leader Alistair Darling this morning insisted he was still ‘very confident’ Scotland would reject independence – as the pound plunged following a surge in support for the ‘Yes’ campaign.

Support for independence took the lead this weekend, sparking panic in Westminster. The development has also spooked the markets with the pound slumping to a 10-month low this morning.

The 1 per cent fall adds to sharp losses seen last week after an earlier poll revealed gathering momentum for the independence campaign. Sterling had been at a six-year high against the dollar at the end of June.

Shares in a series of Scotland's biggest companies also fell this morning. Six of the 10 biggest fallers on the FTSE were Scottish based. 

Michael Hewson, an analyst at CMC Markets, said: ‘For quite some time investors had dismissed the prospect of a Yes vote as an outlier, but recent opinion polls have shifted that perception and this has been no better demonstrated than by the plunge in sterling this morning.’

Mr Hewson added: ‘One thing is certain, if we get this sort of volatility on the prospect of a Yes vote, can you imagine the reaction if we do get a Yes vote? It's not likely to be pretty.’

Mr Darling, the leader of the ‘No’ campaign, this morning tried to calm unions nerves by insisting that Scottish voters would not take the risk of voting for independence next week.

He insisted the 'No' campaign were not panicking, but admitted: 'We're in a position now where every voter in Scotland could potentially tip the balance in this referendum.'

The former Chancellor added: 'I am confident that we will win, because we do have a very strong positive vision of what Scotland can be, both in terms of the opportunities and the security that comes with being part of the UK, a strengthened Scottish parliament with more powers, which is what people want, and you can do that without having to break up the country to do it.'

Scotland's Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told BBC Radio Scotland that the plunge in the pound was the UK Government’s fault.

She said: 'It's not unusual in political campaigns, or indeed on budget days, for the value of the pound to fluctuate. I think that would suggest that the financial markets see Scotland as a strong economy.

'But, of course, we've made very clear that we want to continue with a currency union. If the UK Government was prepared to sit down with the Scottish Government today, we would do that and it would be within our powers jointly to give reassurance there.

'It is the UK Government that's creating the uncertainty by refusing to have those sensible discussions.'

The Queenis said to be 'concerned' at the prospect of Scotland walking away from the United Kingdom

In 1995 the Canadian province of Quebec voted on whether to secede from Canada. 

With a month to go, the 'No' camp held a steady lead. 

But the mood changed with just weeks to go before the referendum. 

The final polls pointed to a 53-47 per cent victory for Yes. 

But on the day, some voters pulled back from the brink, and Quebec voted to remain part of Canada by 50.6 per cent to 49.4 per cent. 

Today’s row came after David Cameron held talks with the Queen in Balmoral yesterday amid growing concern at the prospect of the end of the 300-year-old Union.

It emerged today that the Queen, who is thought to strongly favour the Union, will be in Scotland on September 18 – the day it could vote to break away from the rest of the UK.

Pro-Union MPs said her presence at Balmoral would be a sign of continuity.

A YouGov poll yesterday put support for independence at 51 per cent, with the No camp on 49 per cent. The Better Together campaign has surrendered a 22-point lead in the space of a month.

The No campaign is haemorrhaging support among women, working class people and Labour voters.

Chancellor George Osborne yesterday announced an 11th hour guarantee to devolve further powers to Scotland over tax, spending, welfare and a host of other areas in a bid to reverse the trend to independence.

Mr Cameron, Ed Miliband and Gordon Brown will join forces this week to promise Scotland more powers from London if voters choose to stay in the UK.

A cross-party plan for increased control over tax, welfare and job creation in Edinburgh would be announced ‘within days’, said Mr Osborne.

Yesterday Peter Kellner, YouGov’s president, said: ‘In the past four weeks, support for the Union has drained away at an astonishing rate. The Yes campaign has not just invaded No territory – it has launched a blitzkrieg.’

Pro-independence campaigners, such as these in Edinburgh, have gained the momentum in the battle to separate from the United Kingdom

However, a separate poll for the Yes Scotland campaign by pollsters Panelbase put the pro-Union camp still four points ahead – by 52 per cent to 48 per cent.

The three main Westminster parties have previously promised further devolution in the event of a No vote, telling Scottish voters they can remain in the UK and ‘have the best of both worlds’.

But this week’s promise of a fixed timetable, an attempt to shift away from the widely-criticised negative messages of the No campaign, echoes a similar package offered to the Canadian province of Quebec before an independence referendum in 1995, that snuffed out a late surge in support for breaking away.

Mr Osborne also insisted that if Scotland were to opt for independence then under no circumstances would it be able to use the pound as its currency, as Scotland’s First Minister Alex Salmond says he plan to do.

Mr Salmond dismissed the offer of a commission to hammer out new powers for Holyrood as a ‘panicky last-minute measure’.

Mr Cameron, at Balmoral yesterday with the Queen, was expected to reassure her that in the closing days of the campaign he intends to make the ‘emotional argument’ about all that England and Scotland have achieved together and what ‘we can continue to achieve’.

Sources have confirmed that the monarch will continue with her annual holiday at her private estate in the Highlands, on September 18.

A senior royal source was quoted as saying: ‘The Queen is a Unionist. Lots of people were telling us that it was going to be OK but there is now a great deal of concern.’

A Palace spokesman said: ‘The referendum is a matter for the people of Scotland: the Queen remains strictly neutral on this, as she does on all political issues. The Queen has maintained a close interest in the referendum as she does with all major matters of public debate and is being kept informed by her ministers and officials in the usual way.’
