Jose Mourinho has warned his title rivals that he is building another Chelsea empire fit to last for up to a decade at the top.

Mourinho has been thrilled with the impact of his £75million trio of Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas and Filipe Luis and the way they have responded to his demands in pre-season, adding to the feeling his may be the team to beat in the title race.

Main man: Veteran defender John Terry remains an integral part of Mourinho's plans

The Chelsea boss is confident the new recruits have added the missing ingredient to a squad packed with young and emerging talent and which retains a sprinkling of grisly know-how in the shape of John Terry and Didier Drogba.

‘We have the squad that we want to have,’ said Mourinho. ‘We don’t say it’s perfect, we don’t say it’s the best. There is no manager in the world that says his squad is perfect and could not improve in certain positions.

‘We say we like very much our squad. It is a squad for tomorrow, for next season and also a squad with big possibilities for the next five or 10 years with so many young people. So, I like my squad very much.’

Mourinho applauded the Stamford Bridge board for striking fast to fulfil his requests in the transfer market.

‘I love the club because the club was fantastic and gave me the three targets I was asking for, in the left back, a midfield player and a striker,’ he said. ‘In fact, they gave me two strikers because Didier is also back.

‘We have bought three people in Filipe, Diego and Fabregas, all in the best stage for a football player, between 25 and 30. They are three experienced players with quality to strengthen immediately our team. Last season we went into the season with a different profile when we bought people like Mohamed Salah and Andre Schurrle; people that needed some time. We also went to people like Kurt Zouma, but these players — Cesc, Costa and Luis — are ready.

‘The squad improves, for sure, and the team can show qualities on the pitch that in the past we didn’t. The team has to be better. But obviously, this is the Premier League and every team tries to be better, especially at the top.

‘Are we ready for that? Yes we are but this is England. In other countries the title race is between two teams and sometimes only one. Here it is between five or six.’

Chelsea’s summer recruitment drive has been offset by the sale of David Luiz and Romelu Lukaku, just as their moves in January for Nemanja Matic, Salah and Zouma was offset by the sale of Juan Mata and Kevin de Bruyne.

It is dividend for their policy to buy younger players with a sell-on value, in line with UEFA’s Financial Fair Play rules. Even if that policy cost them a few trophies in the past couple of years, Mourinho has been able to raise funds for his rebuilding programme.

Special one: Mourinho hopes to get the best out of Eden Hazard this season

When Chelsea beat Real Sociedad on Tuesday in their final pre-season friendly before they start the Barclays Premier League campaign at Burnley, they had the look of a vintage Mourinho team, akin to the one he assembled at Chelsea 10 years ago and which lasted the best part of a decade.

It looked well-balanced, with a ruthless physical presence. There was a giant goalkeeper, two big centre halves, the giant Matic prowling midfield, flanked by the energy of Fabregas and Ramires, with the muscle and goal threat of Costa up front.

This framework, Mourinho hopes, will get the best from Eden Hazard, Schurrle and Oscar. If there is a weakness, they are vulnerable should Costa or Matic be ruled out long-term, for any reason. There is also a shortage of homegrown players, which limits their scope to sign any more foreign players, even if they wanted to.

Mourinho ruled out the idea he wanted Roma’s Moroccan centre half Medhi Benatia, valued at £30m. ‘We’re not interested,’ the manager said. ‘We have Terry, (Gary) Cahill, (Branislav) Ivanovic and Zouma.

‘And we want to make Andreas Christensen step-by-step part of the squad. He’s training with us every day, playing a few minutes with us when it’s possible, playing in the Under 21s and training with us as a first-team squad member.’

Zouma, signed from St Etienne in January, is 19 but Mourinho plans to keep him at Chelsea as defensive cover rather than loan him out. Christensen is a highly-rated, 18-year-old Dane, who has graduated from the academy like Nathan Ake, a 19-year-old Dutch defender, who impressed at left back against Real Sociedad.

These teenagers are important to the squad. There are 18 senior foreign players for only 17 places in the official Premier League squad. The most obvious omission before the end of the month is either Petr Cech or Thibaut Courtois.

Mourinho says he will inform his goalkeepers on Sunday who will be his No 1 and the other is unlikely to be content to sit on the bench for the entire season. Mark Schwarzer is at the club as back-up.

Victor Moses, back after a year on loan at Liverpool, could have a role to play as Chelsea try to balance their squad numbers because he was ‘homegrown’, by Crystal Palace.

‘We have one problem to resolve,’ said Mourinho. ‘We have one extra foreign player in at the moment and Victor is not a foreign player.

‘Victor’s best position is on the wings where we have many solutions. We have Hazard, Willian, Salah and Schurrle but he (Moses) is English and at this moment we have one foreign player who has to leave.

‘So until the end of the month we have to make that decision and Victor is involved in this process. Maybe stays or maybe leaves.

‘Because he is English, it is something we have to analyse as well.’

Apart from this minor irritation, it is easy to understand why Mourinho is excited about the season ahead and he has refused to rule Drogba out of Monday’s game at Burnley, even though the 36-year-old striker twisted an ankle in Sunday’s friendly against Ferencvaros.

‘I don’t want to say he’s ready on Monday but with the quality of our medical department and the mentality that he has, I’m not saying it is impossible for him to recover,’ said Mourinho.
