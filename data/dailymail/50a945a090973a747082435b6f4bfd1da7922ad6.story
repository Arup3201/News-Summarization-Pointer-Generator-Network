The San Diego school 
district has agreed to expunge the records of the 31 high school 
students who were suspended for violating their school’s sexual 
harassment policy after making a twerking video on campus.

An agreement was reached Thursday after parents of the juniors and seniors at Scripps Ranch High School filed two appeal.

The
 district will erase mention of the discipline from the student records-
 meaning the suspensions won't show up on the students' transcripts when
 applying for college.

Expunged: The 31 students suspended from Scripps Ranch High School in San Diego in May for making a twerking video will now have their records expunged of sexual harassment charges

The students, mostly girls, were suspended in May after the rump-shaking video was posted online and quickly went viral.

Parents of several students went to a lawyer after the school board said it couldn't overturn the suspensions.

Attorney Ruth Hargrove, who represents three of the girls, says she's thrilled by the agreement and so are her clients.

‘They
 have been through an enormous amount,’ the California Western School of
 Law professor told KSWB. ‘They have been publicly vilified. They have 
been called all kinds of names by all kinds of people.’

'They have been through an enormous amount': Attorney for three of the girls Ruth Hargrove says the San Diego school district needs to re-evaluate its policies

Popular girls: The 31 students, most of them girls, were suspended after the video they shot and edited on campus gained massive attention on YouTube in May

Voluntary: The students decided to make a 'twerking' video during class but say they didn't know where it was going to end up. It eventually was cut into a parody music video and put on YouTube

The district, meanwhile, says now it's time for everyone to move on.

‘The
 parents, students, school and district are ready to move beyond this 
incident and focus on the upcoming school year,’ the school district 
said in a statement. ‘The district cannot provide any further details 
since this is a student discipline issue and therefore confidential.’

But Hargrove said the incident should be a learning opportunity more than just something to move on from.

‘I
 look forward to having the school resolve some of the internal issues 
that propelled this and to changing some of their processes and I think 
they will,’ she said.

The drama began when students at 
Scripps Ranch High School in San Diego reportedly volunteered to 'twerk'
 on camera, and then another student filmed the video and edited it into
 a compiled music video in order to get in on the latest internet craze.

Breaking the rules: The video was filmed at the school using school property before being uploaded online

No turning back: The video has since been taken down from YouTube but it was recorded by others

Administrators at Scripps Ranch High 
School argue that the students were in violation of the school's honor 
code when they performed the sexually suggestive dance move, which 
involves girls shaking their hips and boys watching them do so.

According to NBC San Diego,
 the content is considered a breach of the school's handbook which 
specifically states that students are barred from 'verbal, visual, or 
physical conduct of a sexual nature made by someone from or in the 
educational setting.'

The 
whole situation started when student Lyston McNear, 17, suggested in 
journalism class that they 'make a twerking video', and his classmates 
all willingly participated.

'Nobody was offended or anything. It was like, "Oh, that’s cool,"' he told The Union-Times.

Part
 of the problem is that it was shot and edited on school grounds, 
meaning that the school's honor code allows the school to discipline 
their behavior.

Breaking code: Students thought that they were having fun but now they will be missing out on the fun of prom

Poor taste: The person who filmed and uploaded the video said that he has not heard of anyone complaining about the suggestive dance moves or the foul-mouthed lyrics

Blurred: NBC San Diego blurred the faces of all of the students in the video to hide their identity

McNear argues that he should not
 be punished because he did not appear in the video, simply suggesting 
the idea. Others feel he is the 'ringleader' who edited the footage and 
added the music to go along with the video.

It
 is unclear what grades all of the offenders are in, but if the more 
than 30 students are all seniors, that will make a difference on 
graduation day as the graduating class is made up of about 600 students.
