Kris Kross rapper Chris Kelly had been using a combination of cocaine and heroin - a practice known as 'speedballing'  - the night before his death, according to a new report.

According to TMZ, who have seen 
an official report, Kelly's mother Donna Kelly Pratte told police her 
son had taken a mixture of cocaine and heroin the night before so she'd 
taken him to her home while he recovered.

She added that he'd felt nauseous 
before passing out and that after finding him unresponsive at 3pm on Wednesday, she 
called 911 for medical assistance.

'Speedballing' is the mixing of cocaine and heroin, which is then subsequently taken together (either via injection, snorting or even smoking)

River Phoenix died aged just 23 from snorting the combination at The Viper Room in L.A, Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist Flea accompanied his body to the hospital, five years earlier he lost his friend Hillel Slovak - an original RHCP guitarist - to the same deadly combination.

John Belushi was found dead at L.A's Chateau Marmont in 1982 after injecting a speedball, he was 33.

After they failed to resuscitate him,
the 90s star - famous for the hit song Jump was transferred to hospital
where he was pronounced dead at 5pm.

The report states that Kelly's mother
and Kelly's uncle both told investigators the rapper had an 'extensive 
history of drug use'.

In the hours before he passed out, Kelly did an interview with The Streetz Morning Grind radio show and sounded off colour.

He is said to have made a reference to his partying antics, which upset the DJ - a friend of his.

An autopsy is due to be held on Thursday.

Speedballing is a deadly combination that has 
claimed the lives of many people, and a flirtation with danger that 
celebrities seem inexorably drawn to.

John
Belushi, River Phoenix, Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak 
and Alice in Chains frontman Layne Staley all died from combining the 
two drugs.

Kelly, known as Mac Daddy, performed alongside Chris Smith, known as Daddy Mac, in the early and mid-90s.

The
duo's hit song Jump, from their 1992 debut 
album, Totally Krossed Out, helped propel them to stardom and sales of 
four million copies in the US, topping the Billboard charts for eight 
weeks.

Kris Kross was also noted for their hip-hop style - and in particular wearing their clothes back to front.

The teen 
rap duo were discovered at age 13 at an Atlanta mall in 1990 by then 
18-year-old rising star Jermaine Dupri, who helped them to record the hit album.

On Thursday Dupri wrote an emotional letter to his fans detailing his close relationship with Chris.

The multi-platinum selling producer described Chris as the son he never had.

In 1992, the talented pair landed a 
spot on Michael Jackson's Dangerous world tour, as well as a cameo 
appearance in his popular Jam music video.

Their own music video for Jump shot to number one on MTV and sold over 100,000 copies as a VHS video single.

Their
second and third albums also went platinum and gold respectively, but 
didn't achieve the success of their first album, due in part to the fact
that the teenagers had hit puberty and were marketed with a tougher 
image.

A joint statement released on Wednesday by So So Def and Kelly's mother, Donna Kelly Pratte, paid tribute to the 'kind, generous and fun-loving' star.

'It is with deep sadness that we announce that our beloved Chris Kelly has passed away on May 1.

'To millions of fans worldwide, he was the trend-setting, backward pants-wearing one-half of Kris Kross, who loved making music. But to us, he was just Chris - the kind, generous and fun-loving life of the party.'

Though he was only with us a short time, we feel blessed to have been able to share some incredible moments with him. His legacy will live on through his music.'

Atlanta radio host DJ Greg Street shared the news with listeners after receiving the devastating news from Kelly's cousin.

'Around
7.45 I received a phone call from his cousin saying they had found 
Kelly at the house just 20 minutes earlier and he was unresponsive,' 
Street wrote.

'I just received confirmation that he has passed.'

Twitter erupted as condolences flooded in from celebrities and friends.

Rapper and actor LL Cool J dedicated a song to the departed rapper, 
tweeting 'R.I.P Chris Kelly. This song is now officially dedicated to 
you. May GOD embrace your soul & lift up your family.

Actress
Alyssa Milano was also quick to pay her respects to Kelly's memory 
tweeting 'Rest in peace. Chris Kelly #KrisKross #jumpjump.'

Kelly and Smith had reunited once more to star at a 20th anniversary all-star concert 
honouring So So Def Recordings in Atlanta in February.

'Me
and him, we have our times when we don’t talk and our times that we do 
talk,' Kelly told Yahoo Music when asked about his friendship with 
fellow rapping partner Smith shortly before their reunion.

'But if it’s 
any time that I needed him or needed to reach him it was never a 
problem.'

Kelly had also been broadening his talents, going to back to school to become a musical engineer.

'I
just wanted to do something different,' he said. 'Get more on the 
technical side of things than just being an artist, and produce. I just 
wanted to be [the] all around best I could be as far as doing 
everything.'
