A ‘mansion tax’ on the country’s most expensive properties could be introduced as early as next year according to Cabinet minister Danny Alexander.

Mr Alexander, the Liberal Democrat Chief Secretary to the Treasury, said that ‘a lot of work’ had already been carried out by Treasury officials on the feasibility of a scheme.

This would mean that the tax could be introduced by a Government elected at next year’s May General Election.

Taxable: This home on the Thames is valued at £3.5m. It would fall foul of a mansion tax if introduced by the next government

Speaking to The Daily Telegraph, Mr Alexander said: ‘There’s a consensus among the public that a modest additional levy on higher value properties is a fair and reasonable thing to do in the context of further deficit reduction.

‘It's important that the burden is shared.’

The Chief Secretary claimed that the new levy would not be ‘punitive’ and that the Liberal Democrats are still in favour of people creating wealth.

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander has tasked his officials with carrying out a feasibility study on the imposition of the mansion tax

The party believes that the tax should be paid by people whose homes are valued at £2million or more.

Last year, the Treasury estimated that around 55,000 homes would fall into that category although the Liberal Democrats insist the figure is closer to 70,000. Most of the homes that could fall into the taxing bracket are in London and the south–east.

Prime Minister David Cameron is said to be against the tax although Chancellor George Osborne is thought to be more amenable to the idea.

Opponents: London Mayor Boris Johnson is opposed to the mansion tax while Chancellor George Osborne is said to be more open to the idea

Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London, vowed last week to oppose any move towards the tax, describing it as ‘brutally unfair on people who happen to be living in family homes’.

Mr Alexander said he planned to soon reveal how the tax would be implemented and how houses would be valued.
