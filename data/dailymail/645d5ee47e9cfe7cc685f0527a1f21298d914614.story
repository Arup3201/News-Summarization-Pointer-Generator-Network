The doctor who oversaw the safe delivery of the Prince William's son George was rewarded with a knighthood.

Marcus Setchell delayed his retirement after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge asked him to oversee the birth of their first child, the third-in-line to the throne.

The 70-year-old, who was the royal Surgeon-Gynaecologist for two decades, was made a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) - an honour in the personal gift of the Queen.

He looked after Kate when she was taken to hospital with severe morning sickness in the early stages of her pregnancy, oversaw George's birth, and previously helped save the life of the Countess of Wessex.

Sophie collapsed and was close to death when her elder child Lady Louise was born prematurely in 2003, after the placenta ruptured the lining of the womb.

Mr Setchell also led the medical care following the Countess' ectopic pregnancy in 2001 and performed the Duchess of Cornwall's hysterectomy in 2007.

He later described Prince George's birth as 'the pinnacle of my career', adding: 'It was a precious, unforgettable moment when I held the future king of England.'

There was also an honour for Caroline 
Cassells, matron at the private King Edward VII's Hospital in central 
London, where Kate was treated her for morning sickness, who becomes a 
Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order (LVO).

And the Queen's private secretary Sir Christopher Geidt becomes a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath.
