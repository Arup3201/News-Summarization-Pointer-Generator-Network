She is the A-lister with an addiction to vertiginous heels who rarely steps out in public without a pair of Louboutins on her feet.

She even famously said that she 'can't concentrate' in flat shoes - so it comes as no surprise that Victoria Beckham has been crowned the nation's celebrity shoe idol.

According to the latest research, the former Spice Girl clinches the title of ‘best celebrity shoe style', narrowly beating Sarah Jessica Parker and Rita Ora to claim the top spot.

Furthermore, when asked to specify how much they spent, on average, on a new pair of shoes, the majority of respondents said they spent between £10 - £50 per pair.

A third of the women taking part claimed between £50 - £100, while 11 per cent said ‘over £100’.

Other contenders for best celebrity shoe style were Jennifer Lopez, the Duchess of Cambridge, Kelly Brook and Emma Watson.

According
 to the research, 57 per cent of respondents admitted that they had bought shoes
 in the past as a result of a celebrity being pictured wearing them.

street options or designer shoes, 75 per cent of respondents said they preferred
 to purchase shoes from high-street retailers. with just 17 per cent admitting they 
preferred to splurge on designer options.

Mark Pearson, Chairman of MyVoucherCodes.co.uk, who carried out the research, said: 'It’s
 typical stereotype to think that women love their shoes, but our 
results show just how much women are willing to part with for them- and 
how many pairs are stashed in wardrobes across the UK.

'Interestingly, 
many British women cited Victoria Beckham as their top celebrity shoe 
icon, beating out Rita Ora and even Sarah Jessica Parker to the top 
spot, who put Manolo Blahniks on the map during her Sex and the City 
days.'
