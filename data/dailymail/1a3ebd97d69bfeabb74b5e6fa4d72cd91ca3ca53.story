An eccentric aristocrat who inspired James Bond author Ian Fleming has posthumously donated a remote island to the National Trust for Scotland.

Count Robin de la Lanne-Mirrlees, who died in June aged 87, stated in his will that the island of Little Bernera be given to the trust’s Scottish division.

The trust has accepted the gift but Count Robin’s other Scottish island, Great Bernera, will remain in private ownership.

The former Queen’s Herald was best known for his work helping Fleming to research his 1963 James Bond novel On Her Majesty’s Secret Service.

And like 007, the count wooed a succession of socialites

Island aristocrat: Count Robin preferred his small farmhouse on the Outer Hebrides island of Great Bernera, which he owned, to a castle. He served as a 'cover identity' for fiction's most famous spy

In the book, Bond’s cover as genealogist 
Sir Hilary Bray was based on Count Robin, who was then the heraldic 
researcher, appointed by the Queen, at the College of Arms in London.

He 
served as a 'cover identity' for fiction's most famous spy, played in the film by George Lazenby on his only outing as Bond.

Bill Gardner, Development Manager at the NTS, said the gift of the uninhabited 250-acre Outer Hebridean island, worth an estimated £1million, had stunned his team.

He said: 'This appears to be an extraordinary act of generosity from a man who led an extraordinary life.

'We have not been contacted directly as yet regarding the bequest, but it is not unusual for there to be a gap of several months before legal papers are received following public registration of the will.

'Once confirmation is received we will assess the island’s ecology and landscape as to how it can be best conserved for the nation in the light of any conditions attached to the bequest.'

Little Bernera is worth an estimated £1million.

An international playboy who spoke 
several languages, Count Robin won the hearts of debutantes including Fiona 
Campbell-Walker, a top model who married one of the richest men in 
Europe, Baron Thyssen.

After several years of ill health, his colourful life came to an end in the Western Isles at the Blar Buidhe 
nursing home in Stornoway, Lewis.

The Oxford-educated nobleman turned his back on his life as a 
French-born aristocrat to be laird of a Hebridean island, off Lewis. He had suffered two strokes in recent years 
and had been poorly for some time.

A descendant of King Louis Philippe I of France, Count Robin was the 
godson of the 11th Duke of Argyll, and the popular laird of Great 
Bernera.

Count Robin was deeply involved in helping Ian 
Fleming (left) research James Bond’s adventures for the novel On Her 
Majesty’s Secret Service. The film starred George Lazenby (right) as 
007, who posed as genealogist Sir Hilary Bray, a cover inspired by the 
count's job as heraldic researcher at the College Of Arms in London

Count Robin lived there for the second half of his life, latterly moving
into a warden-run community care unit when staying alone in 
his crumbling croft house got too much.

He was born Robin Ian Evelyn Grinnell-Milne in January 1925 to Captain 
Duncan Grennell-Milne, a highly-decorated First World War RAF pilot and 
French Countess Frances de la Lanne.

His parents divorced and his mother later married Scots war hero Major General William Mirrlees.

Taking a liking to her new husband’s surname, her son changed his name 
by deed poll twice, in 1958 and then 20 years ago to Robin Ian Evelyn 
Milne Stuart le Prince de la Lanne-Mirrlees.

Count Robin became a captain in the Royal Artillery serving in India 
during the Second World War and was later a herald to the Queen and 
attended her coronation. He also held numerous foreign knighthoods.

And in 2005, he took up his title of Prince of Incoronata, an Adriatic 
archipelago, bestowed upon him in the 1960s by the exiled King Peter II 
of Yugoslavia, to whom he had been adjutant and confidant.

Fact following fiction: Telly Savalas stars as Blofeld in On Her Majesty's Secret Service, in which the head of Spectre seeks to claim the title of Comte Balthazar de Bleuchamp. Ironically, Count Robin had the title Prince of Incoronata bestowed upon him in 1967 by the exiled King Peter II of Yugoslavia - four years after Fleming wrote his Bond novel

After he moved to Great Bernera, islanders grew extremely fond of the likeable, charming man they called their laird.

He supported many local causes and readily released land for community use, building a bond of trust between laird and crofter.

After the Lloyds insurance syndicates crash in the 1990s, Count Robin had to sell off his assets to pay £2million of losses.

But Great Bernera was never put on the market. He also refused to sell 
Inchdrewer Castle in Banffshire which he bought as a ruin and partially 
restored in 1971.

At the behest of islanders, he withdrew a clutch of uninhabited islands 
off Great Bernera – including Little Bernera – from the market. But 
other grand properties had to go, including a £400,000  chateau in 
France – his mother’s former home – a flat in Paris and Ratzenegg Castle
in Austria.
Many of his prized collection of antiques and paintings were also auctioned off.

Later on, the crash in prices of farmed salmon also hit his finances and
he was forced to sell his seven-bedroom mansion in Holland Park, 
London, and his Swiss apartment.

He was highly regarded on Great Bernera, which has a population of just 350, as a benevolent man.

Fellow islander Rhona Macleod said in 2005: 'He may be a prince, but to us he will always simply be Robin.

'He's had two castles in his life, but he must be the only prince who preferred a croft house on Bernera. That says it all.

'He also must be the only prince who joined a local lottery syndicate - but after Lloyds he needed the money.'

Count Robin was married once, at the age of 45 to a nurse half his age, but it fizzled out after a week.

He had a long-term relationship with a German duchess, Margarethe of 
Württemberg, and is survived by their son Patrick de la Lanne, 50, the 
mayor of Delmenhort – a town of 74,000 people near Bremen in north 
Germany – and three adult grandchildren.

In his later years the count was best known for being an eccentric figure who had an 
aggressive dislike of the Prince of Wales, whom he called 'an absolute 
disgrace' in 2003.

And in the late 1990s he provoked opposition when he proposed to open a drying-out clinic for alcoholics on Great Bernera, which he wanted to call a 'personal rediscovery centre'.

During February 2004 he was admitted to Hammersmith Hospital in London after suffering a stroke and while he was there, he contracted MRSA.

He was convinced he had been infected by bacteria on doctors’ ties and demanded that the neckwear should be banned.
