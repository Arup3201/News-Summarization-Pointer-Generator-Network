The Thunderbirds wouldn't have got very far without their secret high-tech base hidden on Tracy Island.

Now fans can get their very own version of the luxury villa where the show was set after this property inspired by the cult-classic was put on the market.

And priced at just £3million - it's bargain hunters are go.

The futuristic property, in Poole, Dorset, was built in 2005 by Thunderbirds superfan Eddie Mitchell, managing director of Seven Developments.

hideaway as his inspiration

Mr Mitchell took inspiration from the fictional base of the International Rescue Centre on Tracy Island to help create this remarkable one-of-a-kind home.

And just like the Thunderbirds' radio sign off - the stunning home is certainly F.A.B.

The local property developer says many of the striking exterior features - such as the blue glass and iconic copper roof - were all taken from the TV show.

And while the property does lack many of the features of the original Tracy Island villa - it doesn't open up to allow missiles or jets to fly out - it still boasts five en-suite bedrooms, another three bathrooms, a cinema room, a luxury fitted kitchen and a large living space spanning across the ground floor.

Unique: The curved design and blue glass windows were both taken from the Thunderbirds base featured in the popular 1960s TV show

Spacious: The £3million property boasts five en-suite bedrooms, three additional bathrooms, its own cinema and an outdoor pool

Located in the highly sought after Branksome Park area, there is also an outdoor swimming pool, gym and a triple car garage, as well as a large private garden to explore.

The property, aptly named Thunderbird, is currently listed for sale by Sotheby’s Realty and with an asking price of just under £3million, the property has attracted a huge amount of interest from budding buyers.

Steve Issacs, Head of Region for UK Sotheby’s International Realty, said: 'Thunderbird is a very well-known property. People from out of the area often ask us about it so there is no doubt the design is memorable. 

Luxury: The property is just as luxurious as the fictional home of the Tracy family in Thunderbirds and priced at just £3million - it's bargain hunters are go

High
 tech: While the property can't open up to launch missiles or armed 
jets, most electronics in the property can be operated from a single 
keypad

'Although the house is contemporary, it is far removed from some of the square and minimalist houses which have become prolific in the area. 

'Thunderbird also occupies a magnificent plot, undoubtedly one of the best in Branksome Park and Canford Cliffs.

'Houses in the road have sold for up to £4 million so we believe this could be an excellent opportunity for somebody who wants to acquire a highly individual house at a realistic price-point.'

The unique features of this luxury abode have been recognised with a number of awards, including best private home in the 2006 National Home Builder Design awards.

And everything in the one-of-a-kind house can be operated with just one click on an electronic keypad.
