West Ham United have opened talks over a prospective move for Brazilian winger Anderson Luiz de Carvalho, better known as Nene. 

The 33-year-old is a free agent after cancelling his contract with Al Gharafa and has been talking to various clubs across Europe.

But Nene, who scored 20 goals in 43 games during his time in Qatar, looks set to join Sam Allardyce's side if they can agree terms.

Nene scored 20 goals in 43 games during his time in Qatar following spells in both France and Spain

Nene has spent most of his career in France and Spain, notably with Monaco and PSG where he had a good goal scoring record.

A good crosser of the ball and free-kick specialist, Nene could prove a useful addition in the absence of Andy Carroll who is out for the season. 

Chairman David Sullivan is keen to appease supporters in the wake of Saturday 's disappointing FA cup defeat to West Bromwich Albion.

Sullivan was hounded and verbally abused by a small section of the travelling West Ham support following the abysmal performance in the 4-0 defeat at the Hawthorns.
