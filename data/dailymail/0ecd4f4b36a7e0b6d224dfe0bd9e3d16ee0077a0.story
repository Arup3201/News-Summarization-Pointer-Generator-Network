A group of inspiring women in their fifties are proving it's never too late to get fit by embarking on a workout programme that involves weight lifting and high intensity exercise.

Hazel Ponsford, Lorraine Hadris, Sue Jones, and Kim Ivory are all age 53 and admit they have never been fitter than they are now.

From running marathons to becoming models and changing careers, the women admit exercising has given them the confidence to do things they never believed they were capable of before.

Self-esteem boost: Hazel Ponsford always hated having her picture taken but a fitness regime gave her the confidence to become a model

Hazel, from Berkshire, told MailOnline she wanted to get fit at the age of 50 in order 'to be healthy as I entered a new phase of life.'

However, she never expected her fitness journey to end in a new career and a stint as a model.

The former HR manager signed up for a fitness programme with personal trainer Julia Buckley. Julia advocates high intensity exercise that can be done in the home and encourages people to lift weights to tone up and burn fat.

Hazel admits she loved the new challenge and coupled her exercise regime with Julia's healthy eating advice to limit processed foods, dairy and sugar.

Fit and strong at 50: Hazel got into shape following author Julia Buckley's advice

However, one aspect she disliked was the requirement to take before and after pictures in her underwear so she could track her progress and changing body shape.

'I have never liked having my photograph taken so that was not the easiest thing to do,' she admitted.

Hazel had never been overweight but by following Julia's plan, she became stronger and gained a trimmer, leaner body.

She said: 'Itâ€™s hard to see changes in yourself, but it wasn't long before my old clothes didn't fit, telling me that an improvement had been made.'

She also began to grow in confidence and having her picture taken no longer seemed quite so abhorrent.

When Julia was commissioned to turn her weightloss programme into a book published by Bloomsbury called The Fat Burn Revolution, Hazel had the opportunity to prove just how far she had come.

New lease of life: Hazel never thought she would become a fitness model and has now qualified as a personal trainer

She explained: 'In May 2013, came a totally 
unexpected request from Julia - would I be one of the models in her 
book? Wow! What a request. I didn't allow myself time to think and 
immediately agreed.

'I can't in all honestly say that I was looking 
forward to the photoshoot but at no stage did I regret this decision.'

Hazel features in a number of chapters of the book demonstrating the various moves using dumbbells and an exercise ball.

She said: 'I can't believe at the age of 53 I can add "fitness model" to my c.v.' she said.

Her new found confidence and love of exercise has also led to her taking a new career path and she has qualified to be a personal trainer and pilates instructor.

Fitter than ever: Lorraine, 53, completed a tough military-style obstacle race last year

Lorraine, from Oxfordshire, has also found a new lease of life and improved body tone after joining the Fat Burn Revolution.

She said: 'My body was a bit lumpy and bumpy and I resigned myself that at 53 this was the best I could be.

'Bread and cakes were my downfall and a lung condition gave me an excuse not too work out and feel sorry for myself. I found it too intimidating to go the the gym so when I heard I could do Julia's programme at home it appealed to me. I joined the Facebook group and having that support and encouragement made me stick with it.'

Lorraine took 17cm off her waist after taking up the programme and the symptoms of her lung condition abated. 'I am definitely now smaller and fitter than I was 20 years ago,' she said.

Last year she also took part in a muddy obstacle race - The Major - with other people she met through the Fat Burn Revolution.

She said: 'I would never ever done this without this programme and now want to do more.'

Kim, from Leighton Buzzard, was another of the Fat Burn Revolutionaries to take part in The Major race.

She has also completed the London Marathon since turning 50 and has loved taking up weight lifting.

She said: 'I had never been interested in weights before. I've always had the flimsiest arms and really had no arm strength at all. I didn't think I would be able to lift them.'

But Julia advised her to try weighting lifts because she explains: 'Adding muscle not only gives your body a firmer, more attractive shape, it improves athletic performance, reduces injury risk, aids mobility and agility, reduces aches and pains, brings a huge range of health benefits and of course makes you strong.'

After starting with the lowest weight dumbbells, Kim's strength increased and she now lifts 8.5kg. She recommends other women try weight lifting - whatever their age - and that they shouldn't be concerned about becoming too bulky.

She said: 'If you haven't tried weights, give it a go. You can start at the lowest of dumbbells like I did. You simply don't get big muscles. What you get is toned and stronger, and you can eat more because muscle burns more calories than fat.

From 'couch potato' to super woman: Kim Ivory has toned up by lifting weights and ran a marathon after turning 50

'I would say that I am fitter than 20 years ago.  Back then although I was very skinny, I had no tone or aerobic fitness. Now, I would say that I pretty fit for my age.'

She added: 'It's never too late to get fit. I was a complete couch potato until I was 48 and started running. I couldn't run for more than 15 seconds at a time then, but three years later I completed the London Marathon.

'I feel pretty body confident now and I can still wear a bikini. I am pretty proud of myself for not "letting it all go".'

Sue, a film editor from Cardiff, has dropped 5st since turning 50 and starting to work out following Julia's advice.

She can now give her two grown up sons a run for their money doing sit ups and press ups.

She said: 'I used to eat too much. Wine with dinner were unused calories and had become a daily habit. I was amazed at quite how out of shape I was at the beginning of the 12 week programme.

'Now I am a lot fitter, my energy levels now are fantastic.'

She admits that she was wary of lifting weights at first, especially as the free weights areas of gyms always seemed to be 'men only.'

She explained: 'The main worry is looking like a male weight lifter, but I learnt that really isn't going to happen unless you take it to extremes and take supplements. The only outcome you will get are lovely toned muscles.

'I invested in a good set of weights so I could use them every day in the privacy of my own home, my weights collection has grown and grown. I even have a pull up bar on the door now.'

She added that she hopes she and her other '53 Club' members of the Fat Burn Revolution can inspire other women to get into shape and not be afraid to pump iron.

'It's never too late in life to try anything, and 50 is nothing these days,' she said. 'I want to stay as mobile, strong and mentally alert for as long as I can, that means investing some time now.'
