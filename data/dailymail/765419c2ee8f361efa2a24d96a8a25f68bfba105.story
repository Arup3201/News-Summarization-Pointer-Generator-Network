The Colombian escort at the center of the  Secret Service scandal has revealed more sordid details of the night President Obama’s men paid her for sex at a hotel. 

Speaking from Madrid, Spain where she was staying with family, Dania Suarez, 24, said the men were 'stupid brutes' and drinking vodka 'like it was water' in a local bar.

A government report published last week told how the 
Secret Service agents involved in the Colombian prostitution scandal 
paid nine of the 12 women that they took home from the bar that evening to the Hotel Caribe in Cartagena.

'I can't help that I'm attractive': Dania Suarez said that the Secret Service agents - one of whom paid her for sex - were not fit to be part of President Obama's security detail

The agents had been in Colombia in preparation for President Obama's trip to the country.

Miss Suarez, a single mother of a nine-year-old son, agreed to be interviewed for free to tell her side of the story.

She described the men as 'stupid brutes' who chose to party with young women instead of making the President's safety their priority.

Dressed in a peach mini-dress and bold necklace, Miss Suarez told Msnbc: 'They liked to show off their bodies, great bodies, well-defined abs... I was surprised that every time he danced with me, he lifted up his sweater so I could see.'

The 24-year-old said there was one 'crazy guy' who would jump up on the bar. She also said that the way the men approached her and her friends gave the impression that they had done it before. 

When asked by the reporter if she 
tempted the agents, Miss Suarez burst out laughing and said she could 
not be faulted for being attractive but that it was the agents' fault for 
'leaving their duty behind'.

Seedy: The U.S. Secret Service agent allegedly took Miss Suarez to his room in Cartagena's Hotel Caribe after agreeing to pay her $800 for sex

One man, identified as Arthur Huntington, allegedly agreed on a price of $800 to have sex with Miss Suarez. She explained that during the transaction she gestured the amount with hand signals and using the words 'sex', 'sexo', 'cash', dinero' to get the point across.

She said the pair had 'normal' sex and then the agent fell asleep, giving her ample opportunity to steal whatever she wanted from his hotel room - which she did not do.

They liked to show off their bodies... I was surprised that every time he 
danced with me, he lifted up his sweater so I could see.

The 24-year-old said the next morning, although the man wanted her to stay, she asked for the money they had agreed upon the previous evening - which was when he became 'very angry'. 

The agent then gave her $50 and closed the door. Police became involved, setting off a 
Secret Service investigation which involved 12 agents, another 12 
members of the military and which overshadowed Barack Obama's visit to 
the Summit of the Americas.

She described the men as 'completely stupid' and that she didn't know how they had come to be a part of Obama's security team.

Miss Suarez turned sombre when she 
explained that she was not proud of her actions. However, she reportedly
was considering a book deal offered by an American publisher as she has
more details to reveal.

Last week, the Secret Service submitted a 
detailed report about what exactly happened on the night that a dozen 
agents were partying at a bar in Cartagena while in the country to 
protect the President.

The report confirms that nine of the 
women who went back to the Hotel Caribe with the agents were paid 
thought their identities were not publicly revealed.

The Washington Post says that the 
24-page report was submitted to the relevant congressional committees 
who are investigating the scandal, and those officials will not release 
the full extent of their findings.

Investigators from the Secret Service 
are continuing their hunt for more information about the evening, and so
far they have only spoken with those nine women.

They are still looking
to talk to the remaining three women.

So far, they have done background 
checks on the first nine and have reported that none of them have 
connections to terrorist organizations or drug cartels, which was a 
major concern at the beginning of the scandal since they had access to 
the Secret Service agent's hotel rooms.

The women were aged between 20 and 39 years old.

In an interview last week, Miss Suarez said she never would have complained about not being paid had she 
known the agent was in the American Secret Service.

She said she fled the country after 
the scandal broke for fear of retribution, and spent time in Dubai with a
person she had met in Cartagena before going to Spain.

Suarez said she considers herself an escort, because prostitutes ‘are lower class and live in brothels.’

Taking care of business: Suarez said that she is now willing to sell her story

'We’re going to use this as a base to 
operate from, but we’re also waiting for those statements from the 
women,' Congressman Peter King told The Washington Post.

Mr King, one of those in charge of the
congressional investigations, said that speaking to the remaining three
women 'will fill in a lot of the gaps'.

The report also details the staff ranks of some of the dozen agents involved with the women in Cartagena, Colombia.

Two were supervisory criminal investigators, three were snipers, three were part of a counter-assault team.

Nine of the 12 agents submitted to polygraph exams, while three chose not to cooperate.

One of the three that did not submit 
to a test was the man who initially caused the whole fiasco by refusing 
to pay his prostitute in full.

That man, identified as Arthur Huntington, would not pay the $800 he initially agreed to pay prostitute Diana Suarez.

Huntington's wife, Jolie, told 
relatives she will ‘make the marriage work’ with Arthur Huntington, her 
husband of nearly 20 years.

Friends and family of the couple say that he would never have intentionally hurt her.

Huntington has left the agency since 
the incident earlier this month, but the circumstances of his departure 
are unclear.

The revelation came as the Secret 
Service circulated 'enhanced standards of conduct' from director Mark 
Sullivan in response to the prostitution scandal in Colombia.

The document instructed employees to 'consider your conduct through the lens of the past several weeks.'
