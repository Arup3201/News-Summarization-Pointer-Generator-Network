In 1957 the Thames was so polluted it was declared 'biologically dead', meaning the amount of oxygen in the water fell so low that life could not survive and if anyone fell in, authorities would have to quarantine them.

Now, thanks to a massive clean-up operation, anglers and wildlife fans are reaping the benefits.

One lucky fisherman is Rick Hodson, who has just caught a 9lb cod and won the Thames Fishery Research Experiment, an annual competition held to check the size and variety of species in the river held by the City of London.

It was this big: Mr Hodson may have trouble convincing his friends he landed the huge cod

Mr Hodson, 67, caught the monster fish at Denton, near Gravesend in Kent, has entered the competition 38 times and in all that time has never even heard of a fish that big.

He told the Evening Standard: 'It was just a lucky fish. I was after whiting.'

The retired insurance broker will eat the fish with his wife Shirley.

Other fish caught at Saturday's event were two pouting, three dab, 24 flounder and 520 whiting.

The Thames has roughly 125 species of fish, while more than 400 species of invertebrates live in the mud, water and river banks. It now ranks among the cleanest metropolitan tideways in the world.

John Woods, chairman of the London Anglers Association said it was now fairly common to find cod in the Thames water.

He said: 'It depends where you are fishing along the Thames but where there are large concentrations of salt water, closer towards the sea, it is quite common.

'It also depends on the time of year and during the colder months they are easier to find. People have been catching cod in the Thames for years.'

The Thames has undergone a startling transformation in the last fifty years, and now boasts an abundance of life
