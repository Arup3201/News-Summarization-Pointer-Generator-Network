They were supposed to fill the pages of Vanity Fair and Vogue, but instead they were left on the editing room floor and forgotten for more than 80 years. 

Thousands of celebrity portraits and fashion photographs taken by famed Jazz Age photographer Edward Steichen are now on display after recently being uncovered in the Condé Nast archives.

While some of the 2,000 prints of actresses, poets and dancers were published, others didn't make it into print and are finally being showcased  for the first time  - including a portrait of Winston Churchill before the onset of World War II. 

Portraits of Katherine Hepburn,  Fred Astaire, HG Wells, George Gerschwin, Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo and WB Yeats were also found in the horde, along with fashion photographs of models donning designs by Chanel and Lanvin.

Photography curator Todd Brandow found the photos after hearing a rumor that there were long overlooked pictures stored in Condé Nast's New York offices (the magazine publisher is currently moving offices from midtown to 1 World Trace Center).  

'It was difficult to get access, but when I finally got in, they told me that it had all been sold and nothing was left,' Brandow told CNN.

'But then the archivist rolled out these boxes of 2,000 prints. It was one of those great 'oh my God' moments.'

The pictures are now on display at the London Photographer's Gallery  through January 18.

Natalie Herschforder, who co-curated the exhibit, describes Steichen as the 'Picasso of photography' and 'one of the top five photographers of all time'.

However, he had a relatively unlikely rise to fame. 

In the early 1920s, Steichen was impoverished and traveled steerage from Paris, where he lived during World War I, back to his home country of the U.S. to find photography work to pay the alimony bills from his recent divorce.

When he arrived in America he read an article in Vanity Fair describing him as 'America's greatest portrait photographer' and called the magazine for a job. 

Within a few weeks, he was travelling in style back to Paris with a first class ticket paid by the magazine to cover fashion week. 

For the rest of his career working for Vanity Fair and Vogue, Steichen made the equivalent of $1million by today's standards, in addition to another $1million in commercial work. 

However, Steichen got bored of the fashion work quite quickly, and resigned to focus on horticultural photography in 1935.
