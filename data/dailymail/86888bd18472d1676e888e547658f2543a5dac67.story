No longer, it seems, is just one honeymoon location enough. ‘Dual’ honeymoons – when you travel to more than on location during your post nuptial break – are fast becoming the latest and most desirable way to show your wife you care.

The latest celebrity couple to split their honeymoon along geographical lines is Rebecca Adlington and fellow swimmer Harry Needs.

After tying the knot in August at The Ashes near Leek in Staffordshire, the couple started their romantic getaway in Rome in Italy before flying to Orlando, Florida.

In a series of photographs published on Instagram and Twitter the couple documented what fun they had during the  trip.

When in Rome Olympic swimmer’s husband tweeted a series of three pictures of the couple enjoying an evening out with the caption 'Roma #honeymoon'

Rebecca put a shot of her and Harry with the sea behind them up on Instagram with the caption ‘Our Italian adventure #honeymoon’.

Obviously keen to take in the sights, there is a picture of them in front of the Altare della Patria - also known as the Monumento Nazionale a Vittorio Emanuele II - in the busy Piazza Venezia. They also visited the Vatican, the Pantheon and walked around the city’s famous Roman ruins.

Part two: Rebecca flew to Disney World Florida in Orlando to enjoy the second week of her honeymoon

Never scared of making a splash, Rebecca laughed and smiled her way down the resort's log flume ride

Next stop – via a Virgin Atlantic flight – was Disney World Resort in Florida, Orlando, where they were joined by fellow swimmer Michael Gunning.

Rebecca tweeted, 'Hello Orlando!! So excited to be spending the week here! Great flight with now off to hotel-theme park tomorrow!!' on their arrival. 

The trio rode on the famous long flume-style ride called Splash Mountain and visited Disney's Animal Kingdom. On one picture she put on Instagram of the ride Rebecca commented, ‘Sums up our trip…. @harryneeds loving life - @michaelgunning1 scared and me laughing/smiling the whole way through!!! #splashmountain #disney’.

The 25-year-old ex-Olympic champion then posted a picture of her and Harry standing in front of the famous Cinderella Castle  with the caption ‘where dreams come true’.

She also found a pair of bridal style Minnie Mouse ears with a veil and posed for a shot in one of the gift shops. 'Couldn't help myself today,' she wrote. 'Was a Disney bride!'

Lastly, Harry and Rebecca visited Universal Studios, another theme park in Orlando which has – as well as all sorts of rides and attractions – a ‘romantic’ restaurant and pool.

The time of their life? The couple packed in many different sightseeing locations as well as two continents

The couple could well have visited The Wizarding World of Harry Potter while here.

Keen to keep her followers abreast of their movements Rebecca put up a picture of the couple standing happily outside of the Universal sign. She wrote underneath, ‘Such an amazing day at Universal!!!!!!’ 

'Couldn't help myself today.... Was a Disney bride!' Rebecca wrote  after trying on bunny ears in Disney World

To fuel duel honeymoon bookings, new websites are popping up every day that are designed to help tailor your honeymoon to more than one location.

Honeymoondreams advertises a 'multi-centre' honeymoon intended to be 'an ideal compromise between you and your partner. You may love relaxing on a beach, while your other half likes to discover the local culture.'

Likewise Blacktomato has options ready in case 'one draw dropping luxury destination just isn't enough'. 

From the slough of Instagram pictures published by both Rebecca and Harry during their time away, it looks to have worked for them.
