Rain ruined day two of the second Test between South Africa and the West Indies as only six overs of play were possible at Port Elizabeth.

Faf du Plessis, on 99 overnight, reached his century with a four from the first ball of the day after a delayed start, but was then dismissed off the very next delivery.

It was just as well the action was so tightly packed into what play was possible, as the covers would soon be on and, despite hopes of salvaging the evening session, the players never returned with play finally abandoned at 5.05pm local time.

South Africa, on 270 for two overnight, were seeking to set a big target but may need to adjust their tactics now with so much time lost.

Play was delayed by an hour due to wet conditions, extending Du Plessis' nervous wait on 99, but he seemed unaffected as he flicked away Jerome Taylor's opening delivery behind square.

However, perhaps he relaxed too much after that as, with the very next ball, the West Indies appealed for a catch behind.

Umpire Paul Reiffel said no but Du Plessis was out on review as it showed a nick on the way through to Denesh Ramdin's gloves.

His 103 came off 230 balls with 13 fours and two sixes.

Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers put on 15 between them before the weather closed in once more, forcing the players off only half an hour after they had begun.

Occasional stoppages in the rain kindled hope that they would be able to get in a couple of hours after an early tea, but it was not to be.

Play is now scheduled to begin an hour early on Sunday, with Amla on 23 and De Villiers on nine.
