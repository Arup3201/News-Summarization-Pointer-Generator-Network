Here we assess Rooney's performance in the showdown that took place on the pitch.

DID HE PACK A PUNCH?

Rooney was having a relatively quiet game until the 34th minute, when he seized upon a misplaced Nabil Bentaleb pass, burst through a clutch of Tottenham players and slotted past Hugo Lloris - before celebrating by recreating the video, throwing a flurry of air punches boxer-style and then falling backwards to hit the deck.

Having brought the crowd to their feet in that moment, he showed less potency thereafter in his centre-forward role, sending a few efforts off-target, at least one of which he probably should have done better with.

COMBINATIONS

Very early on, his link-up play was not coming off, a notable example being when he failed to pick out Juan Mata with an attempted cut-back in the box.

He was also not involved in either of the first two goals - but his influence soon grew as he produced several nice touches to help build attacks, as well as getting on the scoresheet himself.

LASTING THE DISTANCE

Went the full 90 minutes, and while not exactly a constant threat during that time, he caused plenty of problems for Tottenham in what was a commendable display overall.

KNOCK-OUT MOMENT

Undoubtedly delivered one with the goal and celebration, nicely showcasing his strength, technique and willingness to poke fun at himself all in the space of a few seconds.
