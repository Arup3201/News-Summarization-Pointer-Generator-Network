The frontman for a fledgling Los Angeles rock band who was sentenced to seven years in prison in after illegally bilking more than $11 million from banks and using it to fuel his fantasy of being a rock star says he 'regrets losing control' over his fraudulent fortune.

Robert Mawhinney, 30, pleaded guilty in April to five counts, including money laundering. He was sentenced to seven years in prison in October.

The full story of Mawhinney and his lavish rockstar lifestyle will air on ABC's 20/20 tonight at 10pm.

Robert Mawhinney, aka Robb 'TaLLLLL' University, was the self-styled frontman of a Los Angeles rock band Lights Over Paris

'The thing I regret is...kind of 
losing control,' Mawhinney told '20/20' over the phone from prison. 'My 
lifestyle...it was crazy, and I was hoping deep down that I could 
rectify the situation and...pay these things back.'

'I wish I could have done it, or I would have done it without all that money,' he said.

Mawhinney was the lead singer for Lights Over Paris, and authorities say he gave the appearance the band was successful.

Mawhinney grew up in Orange County, California and as a teen idolized bands like Blink-182, reports ABC.

As Mawhinney entered his 20s, he still lacked gigs, a recording contract, and merchandising. What he lacked in actual talent, he mysteriously had in his bank account which he used for trips around the world and expensive hotel rooms.

Brian King, who answered a Craigslist ad to be videographer for the band in 2009 told 20/20, 'It was crazy. There was a lot of shopping.  There was a lot of booze, a lot of 
champagne, and the hotel suite ended up getting trashed at the end of 
the trip.'

'I have no idea where all the women came from,' King said. 'He'd get a 
woman to sit in the middle of the buffet table and hand people sushi off
 of her body'

He received more than $11 million in 
loans from four banks. Prosecutors said he gave lenders statements that 
claimed he had nearly $8 million in assets, but it turned out his 
account had less than $10,000, authorities said.

With his borrowed money, Mawhinney managed to afford a $10,500 a month house in the Hollywood Hills and he managed to buy his dreams of becoming a rock star in order for them to come true.

In 2009 he was able to gain access to a recording studio equipped with session musicians and string support.Â

He enlisted rapper The Game for one of his videos and had a customized tour bus emblazoned with the group's name.

Actress Oliva Hardt was hired to co-star in one of his videos entitled, 'Turn off the Lights' told 20/20 she had questions about how he was able to fund the 6-figure video.

'He told me something along the lines of when his grandfather had passed away that he received some inheritance,' Hardt told 20/20. He lied.

Mawhinney 'used the millions of dollars that he fraudulently obtained for the selfish purpose of funding his fantasy of being a rock star,' prosecutors wrote in court documents.

Loan officers even visited a recording studio in Burbank to determine if Mawhinney, who used the stage name Robb University, was creditworthy. He said he sought the loans to finish a recording room in the studio, among other expenses, court documents show.

Ranee Katzenstein, assistant U.S. attorney, told 20/20, 'The loan officer in the bank asked Mr. Mawhinney to provide proof of 
the statements that he made in the application, regarding his assets and
 his income.'

Actress Olivia Hardt who was hired to co-tar in one of Mawhinney's videos told 20/20 he told her he got his money from some type of inheritance

'The tax return was entirely fake, and the CPA whose name was used on the
 letter...we interviewed him, and he said, again: 'Robert Mawhinney? 
Never heard of him,' said Katzenstein.

Prosecutors said he attempted to pay off of some of his loans with proceeds he received from earlier payouts but eventually defaulted.

The band released an EP 'Turn Off the Lights,' which appeared on Billboard's Heatseeker Albums chart, and also produced a video entitled 'I'm Not A Gangsta,' in which Mawhinney is riding shotgun in a Rolls Royce driven by The Game.

It was on October 1, 2011 when Mawhinney's lies crept up behind him. Mawhinney was supposed to play a show at the Roxy in Los Angelos but sent a DJ in his place. The DJ was presented with legal papers meant for Mawhinney who was months and months behind on his rent.

One year later Mawhinney was arrested in Miami.
