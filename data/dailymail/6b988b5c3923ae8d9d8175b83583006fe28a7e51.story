Claire Allnutt died in hospital after a dirty drip was left in her arm for four days. Her family are now taking action against the NHS trust involved, which, they claim, only gave staff 20 minutes training in a new system of patient monitoring

Medics who treated a young woman who died after a dirty drip was left in her arm for four days had just 20 minutes training in a monitoring system, it has been claimed.

Claire Allnutt was recovering from having the flesh-eating bug necrotising fasciitis at Luton and Dunstable Hospital last year when the contaminated catheter was used to administer antibiotics.

Her devastated parents, Ann and Richard, are now taking action against the NHS trust involved and are claiming staff may have had just 20 minutes training on a new system of monitoring patients.

Ms Alnutt's family have also reported five medics from the hospital to the, the General Medical Council watchdog, claiming a catalogue of errors led to their daughter's death.

Claire, 28, has been suffering from the flesh-eating infection but was making a full recovery after two months in hospital.

But she died from septicaemia when a drip administering antibiotics was left in her arm for four days, triggering blood poisoning.

It later emerged that the hospital was using a new electronic alert system called National Early Warning Score.

It showed that Claire's condition was deteriorating but staff appear not to have acted on the alert.

Her family lodged Freedom of Information request and found staff may have only had 20 minutes training on the system.

They have instructed lawyers specialising in medical negligence cases to take action against the hospital.

Carole Watts of firm Ashton KCJ said: 'On the face of it this seems to be a very short period of training, especially as the electronic warning system deals with life and death situations.

'It's of great concern to Claire's parents that the staff using the electronic system may not have been adequately trained to use it.

'They are devastated by the loss of their daughter and it's important for them to know that lessons have been learnt from their tragic loss.'

An inquest last year heard how a junior doctor spotted fungal spores in the tube on a Friday but it wasn't removed until the following Tuesday.

Observation notes showed Claire's condition worsened over the weekend but medics decided to just monitor her and no action was taken until the Tuesday.

By that time, life-threatening sepsis had set in and she suffered several heart attacks before dying in the early hours of the following morning.

Claire, from Luton, Bedforshire, who was obese and had learning difficulties, had initially refused to consent to the tube being withdrawn because of a phobia of needles.

Ms Allnutt's family have also reported five members of staff at the hospital to the General Medical Council

Her family have questioned why no action was taken to remove the drip, known as a PICC line.

Ms Watts added: 'The family have many questions about the circumstances of Claire's death and why no action was taken to remove the PICC line.

'It's hoped that the GMC complaint will ensure the actions of the doctors around the time of Claire's death are fully investigated and that the family are given the answers that they need.

'Claire's parents are determined to fight for justice for Claire and a civil claim is being pursued against the hospital.'

A hospital spokesman said: 'The Luton and Dunstable University Hospital has given an unreserved apology to Claire Allnutt's family following her tragic death last January.

'All staff groups involved in Claire's case have reflected and learned from the events that occurred prior to Claire's death, and this has resulted in a number of changes to practice, which are being constantly monitored and evaluated.'

Hospital bosses say they have apologised unreservedly to Ms Allnutt's family and have made changes
