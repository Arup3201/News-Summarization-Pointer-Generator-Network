A Utah restaurant has caused a stir over the anatomy of a giant bull it uses to advertise the eaterie, 

Businessman Stephen Ward applied to Hurricane City council for permission to erect the giant bull above his restaurant named Barista's and unveiled the beast earlier this month.

However, locals have attacked the massive sign and have even started a petition for the council strip restaurant of its business licence.

More than 500 people have signed a petition for the restaurant to lose its business licence due to the bull

Owner Stephen Ward, pictured, said locals in Hurricane City dislike him and that is why they are complaining

More than 500 people have already signed the petition, which has been created Charge.org. 

According to the petition: 'As a member of the Hurricane City council has already said, Barista's has given Hurricane, UT a "black eye".

'It's owner is a terrible representation of what our community stands for. He takes advantage of every person that walks into his restaurant. 

'They intentionally take excessive advantage of those that are visiting our community from other parts of the world. 

'They have a horrible reputation that shines a bad light on the rest of Hurricane, UT. We as a community will not stand aside and allow this false representation be made!'

Local resident Denise Mackelprang told The St George News: 'It looks terrible. I could see the bull, but not the details of the sex. It’s R-rated to me, especially with young school kids seeing it and talking about it.' 

Fellow resident Lindsay Knapp complained: 'The giant bull is awesome. The giant, weird testicles and penis are not even anatomically correct … that is my issue.'

However, Mr Ward said local residents do not like him and that is the main problem. He said: 'If I put Pinocchio up there, its nose would be too big. It’s me. It’s me. It’s not the bull. It’s not the restaurant. They don’t like me. But you know what, where does it say in the world, in the Constitution, that they can prevent me having the right to do legal commerce in the United States? That is my God-given right.' 

As well as the petition, some residents have threatened to go to a council meeting to lobby politicians to act against the giant bull.
