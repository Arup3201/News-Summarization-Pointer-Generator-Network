Jane Goldman has deleted her Twitter account after husband Jonathan Ross was subjected to a hate campaign.

Ross, 53, announced yesterday that his screenwriter wife, 43, had left the social networking site following three days of abusive messages targeting him.

It began on Saturday just hours after it emerged that he would be hosting the Hugo Awards  ceremony in August.

He has since stepped down from the event, which celebrates science fiction, but that did not stop the backlash.

Echoing the Andrew Sachs scandal of six years ago, in which Ross was attacked for a sick practical joke he played on the veteran actor that involved a string of lewd comments about his granddaughter, Twitter users had taken to the site to vent their fury.

They said Ross, who has a long history
 of controversy, was an unsuitable host for the ceremony, which 
celebrates science fiction as part of the Worldcon convention.

‘A white man famous for humour denigrating women? I’m the opposite of excited,’ one wrote, while another posted: ‘Good to know women and other minorities need not attend, then.’

And amid the chaos, which involved a 
Worldcon organiser resigning, Ross posted that he had decided to step 
down from hosting duties.

It did not stop there, however, with writer Seanan McGuire continuing to make digs at the comedian.

She wrote: ‘I’ve really enjoyed knowing that, were I to be nominated for a Hugo, the host wouldn’t see me and make fat jokes.

'Like, that thought has actually crossed my mind when shopping for Hugo Dresses, “the host won’t mock me”.’

Ross’s daughter Honey Kinney, 17, defended her father, saying she was overweight and he was ‘kind and sensitive towards women’s body issues’.

But the abuse continued. And Miss Goldman deleted her account with a parting shot at Miss McGuire: ‘Reading all your yay! Women! Tweets this morning, while you rudely ignore a real, live 17-year-old girl whom you hurt deeply with you words, is jaw-dropping.

Backlash: Ross and Russell Brand faced complaints after leaving a rude message for Andrew Sachs

‘You falsely accuse her 
father of sizeism, she gathers the courage to speak to a bullying adult 
with 12.5k followers and you ignored her and casually blathered on about
 the Oscars.

'Don’t worry about the three real women whose weekend you 
ruined (me and my daughter).

‘Women
 like you. Who worry about what to wear and get called fat. And feel 
loved and protected by the man you slandered, and who were brought to 
tears not by imaginary words, but by your ill-considered poison.

'You owe
 my daughter a reply.’
