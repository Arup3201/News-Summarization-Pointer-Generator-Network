As much of the UK freezes under a blanket of snow, spare a thought for this man.

The father was forced to dig his way out of his home after heavy snowfall trapped him inside the house.

The snow was more than 6ft high and had completely blocked his back door.

Scroll down for video

The father poses for the camera in front of his backdoor which is blocked by more than 6ft of snow

Luckily his back door opens inwards and he begins on the mammoth tasks of escaping through the snow wall

A video of the Ukrainian dad escaping through the wall of snow has become an internet hit, and has been seen more than 57,000 times.

The film begins will him tentatively opening his backdoor, which fortunately opens inwards, to reveal the mountain of snow.

To the obvious delight his son, who can be heard laughing in the background, the father sets about trying to get out of his house.

At first he dives headfirst into the snow and his son is sent into even greater fits of hysteria as the father emerges covered head to toe in snow.

However, he had created enough space for him to then use his hands and a shovel to begin shifting the blockage.

But the father falls once more as he tries to climb through the gap.

First of all he dives headfirst into the snow and emerges covered in the white stuff

He does finally manage to escape and is seen posing triumphantly in his back garden at the end of the video.

Ukraine announced a state of emergency this week amid record snowfall and the loss of power in about 600 towns and villages.

Temperatures plummeted to -28C in some parts of the country and some areas received the normal monthly level of snow fall in just 24 hours.

It has been so heavy this winter that
almost 5,000 soldiers have been tasked with clearing roads and 
pavements in ten regions and the capital city Kiev.

Since last week, the service people had already cleared 7,200 roads as they tried to get the country's transport moving again and tanks were used to drag buses and cars from snowdrifts.

The father's escape plan finally works and he is pictured standing triumphantly in his back garden
