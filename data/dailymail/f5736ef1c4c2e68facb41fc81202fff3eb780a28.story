Amazon has pulled from sale two dangerous legal highs after pressure from drugs campaigners.

On Saturday, the Mail revealed that salvia – described as more potent than LSD – and amyl nitrate were on sale on amazon.co.uk.

Amazon was warned last month by campaigner Maryon Stewart that other firms were using its site to sell the drugs, but failed to take action.

Nitrous oxide and poppers were also on sale on the Amazon website but have now been removed

Following the Mail’s article, however, every entry for salvia, a psychoactive herb, and amyl nitrate – known as poppers – was removed.

The company has also removed dozens of listings for similar products in other countries.

Mrs Stewart, whose daughter Hester died after taking the drug GBL, founded the Angelus Foundation to raise awareness of the dangers of legal highs.

She said Amazon’s action was ‘a great victory’ for the foundation and the Mail. ‘I’m particularly impressed that they took the action so quickly to drop them and on their websites around the world,’ she said.

‘These are dangerous chemicals which are potentially lethal and can cause life-long harm to health.

‘This is a lesson to other retailers, that we really need to be vigilant about what is being sold.

‘People need to understand these are dangerous chemicals which are potentially lethal and can cause life-long harm to health.’

Mrs Stewart urged ministers to take steps to deal with a third product, nitrous oxide, known as laughing gas, which is still on sale.

She said it should be licensed so it can only be bought by approved companies for a legitimate purpose. Nitrous oxide is used in foam cream dispensers, but is also often abused and can cause death.

When contacted by the Mail last week, Amazon said: ‘We act quickly to remove any items that contravene our guidelines [for sellers] and take appropriate action with the seller.’

The listings that were removed include one for Salvia promising ‘the purest extracts at the best prices in the UK’ and citing Press articles describing the psychoactive herb as ‘more powerful than LSD, and legal’.

Drug experts warn salvia can trigger psychotic episodes, particularly in young people and those with mental health problems.

Amyl nitrate was also was on sale as a ‘bottled room aroma’, but the product description made clear it was intended for use as a drug.

The Government’s drug website warns that poppers can cause death by reduced oxygen to vital organs. In June 2011, Eric James, a 46-year-old married father, died after inhaling amyl nitrate on Clapham Common.
