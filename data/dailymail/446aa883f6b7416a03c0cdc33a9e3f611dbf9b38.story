A teenage student accused of making bombs in his home told police he took a stolen handgun to his Maryland school last week, but was too drunk to carry out a deadly shooting attack, records show.

Sash Alexander Nemphos, 16, wrote in his journal that he planned to kill his parents, as well as students, teachers and a police officer at the Towson school in Baltimore, court documents state.

The student took the .38-calibre revolver in his backpack to the George Washington Carver Center for the Arts and Technology on Halloween but forgot the explosives for the deadly attack he plotted.

Nemphos, described as a 'shy and talented artist', said he drank whiskey before classes that day and was too drunk to go ahead with his plans, the documents show.

He said he intended to try again on Monday – two days after he was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of car break-ins in Monkton, according to the Baltimore Sun. 

But during an interview with Baltimore County police, he told officers he had explosive devices at his home for his plot to kill people at the Towson school. He was later charged as an adult.

Nemphos' arrest stunned students, staff and parents at the arts school.

Wednesday was Carver's first full day of school this week since the arrest was announced, and counselors were made available to speak with students, according to the school's spokesman.

Police documents show Nemphos told officers he had been bullied for years and had told teachers, but he said they took no action.

Spokesman Mychael Dickerson said he could not discuss the case because of student privacy laws, but said county schools have procedures that teachers must follow if they get reports of bullying.

'Teachers work with counselors immediately,' Dickerson said. He said staff also are trained to take note of students exhibiting abnormal behaviors.

Police were first alerted to Nemphos after three employees at the Monkton Grille on Saturday said someone stole items from their unlocked vehicles in the back lot while they worked.

One worker told the officer dispatched there that she had seen a teenage boy hanging about the restaurant around the time of the break-ins.

A worker at a nearby local shop said a boy fitting the same description often tried to buy cigarettes there. The employee had written down the tag number of a vehicle he once saw the boy enter.

Charged as an adult: The teenager was originally charged as a juvenile on suspicion of the possession of a destructive device and a handgun violation. But on Monday, the suspect's status was changed to 'adult'

Proud: Earlier on Monday, Baltimore Police Chief, Jim Johnson, said the first responding officer who had interviewed Nemphos 'did an exceptional job of police work'. Above, a Baltimore Police tweet says the same

It belonged a vehicle owned by Nemphos' father, and police tracked it to the family's home on Quiet Oaks Lane.

In a police search of Nemphos's house in Monkton after his arrest, officers apparently found three crude, homemade explosives, hazardous materials and a gun, according to the Baltimore Sun.

They then called their Hazardous Devices Team, who dismantled the devices , made from 'readily-available. The teenager reportedly told police he had taken the handgun from his father's job.

At one point during his interview with police, the boy's father pulled the officer aside and told him a handgun at his business in Baltimore had been stolen a few months ago, and he was worried his son might have had something to do with it.

Police said Nemphos eventually admitted he had stolen the gun and hidden it in a plastic container in his bedroom, the documents state.

Chief:  In an online statement: Baltimore Police Chief, Jim Johnson said thanks to the responding officer's 'diligence, we intervened in what could have been an extremely serious situation' at the school in Towson

When asked what he planned to do with the weapon, the teen said he was going to kill his parents and then drive to the school and shoot the school police officer.

He said he planned to take the school officer's gun and kill as many students and teachers as he could, according to the documents.

Shooting: It comes just 10 days after teenager Jaylen Fryberg (pictured) shot five classmates in the cafeteria at Marysville Pilchuck High School in Washington State, killing three girls and injuring the three others

Nemphos faces charges including possession of a destructive device, theft and a handgun violation. He is being held at the Charles H. Hickey Jr. School in Parkville.

No attorney is listed for him in online court records, and his parents could not be reached for comment.

Meanwhile, a Carver administrator told the newspaper there were no 'red flags' that could have alerted staff to the student's deadly intentions.

'At this point, nothing has been shared with us [from the school] to give us any indication that this could have happened,' said Maria Lowery. 'We had no reason to suspect we had an issue.'

Parents of students at Carver - a premier arts school that is considered one of the top-performing insitutions in the country - were notified of the suspect's charges on Monday.

School guidance counselors are currently on hand to help students who have concerns or are distressed about the allegations against Nemphos. 

The teenager, who was initially taken for a mental health evaluation, is being held at the Charles H. Hickey Jr. School, a detention center for male youths, without bail. 

He is also charged with theft in relation to the car break-ins he had reportedly carried out. 

It comes just 10 days after teenager Jaylen Fryberg shot five classmates in the cafeteria at Marysville Pilchuck High School in Washington State, killing three girls and injuring the three others

The unsuspecting teens were all seated at a lunch table when 15-year-old Fryberg pulled out a .40-caliber Beretta handgun and shot each one, before committing suicide.

Last week, investigators said the shooter had lured his victims to the scene by text message before launching the deadly attack.  

And on Monday, another alleged plot for a school shooting was thwarted by police when a 17-year-old girl was arrested in Radnor Township, suburban Philadelphia.

The senior at Radnor High School allegedly wrote in a notebook that she was influenced by the 1999 Columbine High School massacre and wanted to become a mass murderer,

She was arrested and will be charged as a juvenile for making terrorist threats.
