Soaring house prices have caused a surge in the number of people leaving London for the suburbs, with more than a quarter of a million people abandoning the capital last year.

But most of those who leave still feel the pull of the city, with the average move taking them just 26 miles away - firmly within commuting distance.

Research by Hamptons International estate agents linked rises in London prices - which they say will go up 32 per cent in the next five years - with young families heading for more affordable areas.

A jump in house prices has caused a spike in the number of people leaving London for the suburbs, research reveals today

Suburbia: Reigate in Surrey was a popular choice for those leaving London

City to city: Birmingham, pictured, was the single most popular destination for London leavers, but the trend was towards suburbia

They found that the average London 
leaver is 32 years old, had children and moves for lifestyle reasons. 
The most popular destination was Birmingham - England's second-largest 
city - with commuter belt towns in Essex, Surrey and Kent also a 
frequent choice.

But 
while the estate agents found that big moves out of the city are on the 
rise, they also discovered that many people who move go hardly any 
distance at all, with the average distance in England and Wales just 2.5
 miles. For those moving within London it was as little as 1.3 miles.

Hammptons head of sales, Marc Goldberg, said: 'In the last three months the number of London buyers registering with our country offices has increased by 12 per cent.

1.  Birmingham                        5,0002.  Brighton, Sussex               4,9503.  Elmbridge, Surrey              4,4204.  Epping Forest, Essex        4,2605.  Thurrock, Essex                 3,7606.  Manchester                        3,5507.  Hertsmere, Hertforshire   3,5208.  Medway, Kent                     3,5009.  Reigate, Surrey                  3,37010. Dartford, Kent                   3,360

'As house prices increase at a faster rate in London than anywhere else, Londoners are increasingly waking up to the idea that they can get more value for money outside the capital.'

Half of the 250,000 Londoners who left the capital in 2012, moved to the south East and south West.

Those between the ages of 19 and 25 are the most likely of all age groups to move to London as they either start university or new jobs. These new arrivals tend to move 34 miles to their new homes.

The research comes as house prices rose by 0.5 per cent month-on-month in November as surging demand from buyers continues to outstrip the supply of homes for sale, according to property analysts Hometrack

But in a sign that prices could be starting to run ahead of what buyers are willing to pay, the typical percentage of the asking price achieved dipped in November to 95 per cent, from a six-year high of 95.2 per cent recorded in October.

Seaside: Brighton was the second-most popular destination for those leaving London

It is the first time in 11 months that the percentage of the asking price has fallen, although the latest figure also masks a new record high of 97.7 per cent of asking prices being achieved in London.

Widened mortgage availability is said to be fuelling demand from aspiring property buyers, but experts say that a lack of houses to choose from is pushing prices up. 

Richard Donnell, director of research at Hometrack, said: 'A widening gap between supply and demand continues to put upward pressure on house prices. Faster sales are eroding the stock of homes for sale, adding to the scarcity of housing.'

Last week the Bank of England took the first step in applying the brakes to the property market by announcing it is refocusing a lending scheme towards helping small businesses borrow, which experts have warned could spell the beginning of the end for ultra-low mortgage rates.

A mortgage price war broke out after Funding for Lending was launched in August last year and the number on the market has since surged by 40 per cent.

Demand from some would-be home buyers is expected to pick up further in the coming months because of the Government's Help to Buy scheme which was extended in October to offer state-backed loans to people with 5% deposits.
