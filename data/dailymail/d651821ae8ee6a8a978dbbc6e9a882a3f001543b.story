Brazil named Dunga as their manager for the second time on Tuesday, two weeks after they were hammered 7-1 by Germany in the World Cup semi-finals which led to the resignation of former coach Luiz Felipe Scolari.

The 50-year-old, who captained Brazil to their fourth world title success in 1994, was last in charge of the national team in 2010 when he was sacked for failing to take them further than the World Cup quarter-finals in South Africa.

'I am immensely happy to be back,' he told reporters.

Dunga's re-appointment sparks a 
remarkable u-turn by the Brazilian Football Federation (CBF) after the 
former midfielder was wildly criticised for the Selecao's displays four 
years ago.

He led Brazil to the quarter-finals, where they were beaten 2-1 by Holland but was condemned for his negative tactics.

In his previous stint in charge he oversaw 42 wins, which included silverware at the 2007 Copa America and the 2009 Confederations Cup, and just six defeats in 60 matches.

He was sacked after the 2010 tournament and replaced by Mano Menezes.
