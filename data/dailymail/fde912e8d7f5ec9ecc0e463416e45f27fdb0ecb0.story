A same-sex penguin couple are putting their straight neighbours to shame after being dubbed the best penguin parents a Kent zoo has ever had.

The Humboldts, called Jumbs and Kermit, have taken on the chick of a female called Isobel who had to abandon her egg to find food.

It is the second egg the pair has been given, after the first failed to hatch last year, and this latest baby was born on 12 April. 

The two male Humboldts called Jumbs, pictured left, and Kermit, pictured right, were given the egg earlier this year. It hatched on 12 April. The unnamed chick is pictured between the couple. The egg was laid by a female called Isobel who had to abandon it to find food

In May 2012, a pair of same-sex Gentoo penguins called Inca and Rayas adopted a chick at Faunia Park in Madrid.

But it isn’t just penguins that have been known to form same-sex relationships.

Domestic
 rams are statistically among the mammals most likely to form gay 
relationships, with 8 per cent of male sheep forming male-to-male bonds.

Dolphin males have also 
been known to pair up, with relationships lasting as long as 17 years.

While marine biologists have spotted bisexual activity in the 
bottlenosed species.

Homosexual
 wild Australian black swans sometimes form threesomes with two males 
and a female, which has led to higher breeding successes.

This setup doubles 
the chance of reproduction, and the males can more effectively guard a 
nest against a predator.

The male chick doesn’t yet have a name.

Traditionally, zoos and wildlife parks wait to name a chick in case it doesn’t survive, but a spokesman for the Wingham Wildlife Park told the MailOnline that he’s doing ‘really well’ at the moment and the team are optimistic.

With previous births, the park has run a competition on its Facebook page to name chicks, and is planning to do the same once this baby is in the clear.

The male couple first paired up in 2012, effectively leaving two females without mates.

Isobel lays eggs each year with her partner Hurricane, but Hurricane refuses to incubate the egg forcing Isobel to leave it to eat.

Staff at the park therefore stepped in with this recent chick, and gave the egg to the gay pair.

During the official announcement on the park’s Facebook page, a spokesman said: ‘Kermit and Jumbs are a same-sex pair of penguins who bonded over two years ago.

‘While unable to reproduce themselves, we gave them an egg this year, which had been abandoned by one of our females.

‘Kermit and Jumbs have since hatched this egg, and the one-month-old baby is showing that these two penguins are excellent surrogate parents, and dare we say some of the best penguin parents we have here.'

Wingham Wildlife Park’s owner Tony Binskin told the BBC: ‘Whilst pair bonding often results in no result other than eliminating those two animals from the breeding population of that species, in captivity it can have greatly positive effects.

‘We are still very much starting our breeding efforts with this species, and this is only our second year of breeding, but having such good surrogate parents available should we need them is a huge bonus for us.’

Judges, including Dragon's Den star Peter Jones and Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, visited London Zoo yesterday to launch Google's latest Impact Challenge. 

The challenge asks non-profit companies in the UK to tell the search giant how they would use technology to transform lives.

The top four submissions each receive a £500,000 grant, as well as technical assistance and mentoring from Google and Nesta, while six runners each receive £200,000.

Other judges include broadcaster and director of Red Nose Day Emma Freud, Nesta’s Innovation Lab executive director Helen Goulden and Google’s Matt Brittin and Jacquelline Fuller.

The public will have the opportunity to vote for their favourite when the finalists are announced on 21 July.

Last year's UK Challenge awarded top prizes to Solar Aid, Integrity Action, CDI Apps for Good and the public's favourite, The Zoological Society of London (ZSL), Ricky the Rockhopper is pictured

Last year’s UK Challenge awarded top prizes to Solar Aid, Integrity 
Action, CDI Apps for Good and the public's favourite, The Zoological Society of 
London (ZSL).

ZSL's submission included developing technology to place in areas including Kenya, in a bid to catch poachers.

Using sensors and cameras, the system will trigger if it hears a gun shot, for example, and the location of the poacher will be triangulated using images and GPS locations of cameras.

All UK-registered charities have until the 6 June to apply for the challenge online.
