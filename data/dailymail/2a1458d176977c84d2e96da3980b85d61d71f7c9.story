A suspected gun factory which used a state-of-the-art 3D printer was uncovered by police yesterday.

Stunned officers believe a gang were using the machine to make deadly firearms.

They recovered a freshly-made plastic magazine and trigger during a raid in Bagley, Manchester, which could be used to create a handgun.

Technology: Greater Manchester Police found what they thought was a gun-making machine during a raid

One senior officer said organised crime gangs are acquiring technology on the high street to make guns ‘in the privacy of their own home.’

Det Insp Chris Mossop, of Greater Manchester Police, told Sky News: ‘These could be the next generation of firearms.’

The discovery is believed to be the first of its kind in Britain and confirms the worst fears of security chiefs.

They warned just a few weeks ago that criminals were attempting to use 3D printing technology to manufacture guns.

Police fear terrorists and criminals could use the machines and plans that are readily available to download online to circumvent gun controls.

Parts: Officers found a number of components which could have been used to make a handgun, including a trigger

Ministers have also been warned that the plastic parts may not be detected by x-ray machines and other airport security checks.

The seized parts, which were found near an industrial 3D printing machine, were being examined by forensic experts last night.

A police spokesman said a man was arrested at the scene on suspicion of making gunpowder.

In the U.S., several guns have already been produced using the technology, with varying degrees of success.

One of the latest models, which includes a rifled barrel to ensure deadly accuracy, is said to have been made with just £15 of materials.

The latest generation of 3D printers work by building up layer upon layer of material - typically plastic - to build complex solid objects.

The guns are assembled from separate printed components made from plastic, with only the firing pin and a few bolts made from metal.

The Home Office said it will not be possible to ban 3D printers, so officials are working on alternative strategies.

Bullets: Officers believed this  piece of plastic was a freshly-made shell magazine

In May, blueprints for the first-ever plastic gun produced on a 3-D printer were downloaded over 100,000 times in the first four days after they were uploaded.

Designs for the 'Liberator' pistol were posted online by the US company Defense Distributed.However the U.S. State Department ordered the website to take down the blueprints, on the basis that the plans could violate export regulations.

The blueprints, that could be produced on 3-D printers costing as little as £600 were seen as a breakthrough because no one had previously designed such a weapon that could withstand the pressure of firing modern ammunition and could pass through security scanners without detection.

The first plastic gun to be assembled in this way cost just £16 and was built using the state-of-the-art machine, some nails and some household screws.

The engineeer was able to fire nine .38 caliber bullets.

These could include stiff jail sentences for possession of the weapons and making it illegal to download the plans.

Officials believe that other criminal groups have attempted to construct weapons prior to the Manchester discovery.

A
 new strategy document by the National Crime Agency warned: ‘We need to 
develop counter-measures for the imminent risk that 3D printing will 
facilitate the manufacture of weapons or part of weapons’.

In the U.S., more than 100,000 plans for a plastic gun known as the ‘liberator’ were downloaded within hours.

The explosion of interest provoked the Government into ordering the Texas-based company who produced them to take them down.

It used a 3D printer that cost £5,140 from the online auction site eBay to make the parts which, when assembled, create a working handgun.

Police have also warned of the danger of guns being ordered over the internet from the U.S. In Merseyside, police tracked the delivery of a handgun to 15-year-old boy after it was ordered online.

The Manchester raid took place as part of a huge operation to tackle organised criminals linked to drugs, guns and money laundering.

More than £330,000 worth of drugs, counterfeit goods worth £2m, £25,000 cash and weapons including a Taser and a baton have been recovered.

Deadly: What appears to be a sniper rifle equipped with along-sighted lens was recovered during the operation

Arsenal: Officers also found rifles during the operation. At least 100 raids were carried out around the city

Handgun: Pistols and air-rifles were also discovered as police looked to clamp down on organised crime

Manufacturing: They also found glue, labels and a collection of tools which are alleged to have been used to produce counterfeit goods

There are currently more than 160 known organised criminal gangs in Greater Manchester, costing the local economy between £850 million and £1.7 billion each year.

Chief Constable Peter Fahy said that 3D printer guns are ‘a new phenomenon’.

He said: ‘We will really need to look at this new development. Certainly we feel that we are having success - and the important thing is not to be defeatist about this.

‘It is not to think that we’ll never win that these people are cleverer than us, they are not, they are just more violent than us.’

Detective Mossop added: 'This is a really significant discovery for Greater Manchester Police.

Caught: Greater Manchester Police raided a warehouse filled with what are allegedly counterfeit goods

'If
 what we have seized is proven to be viable components capable of 
constructing a genuine firearm, then it demonstrates that organised 
crime groups are acquiring technology that can be bought on the high 
street to produce the next generation of weapons.

'In
 theory, the technology essentially allows offenders to produce their 
own guns in the privacy of their own home, which they can then supply to
 the criminal gangs who are causing such misery in our communities.

'Because they are also plastic and can avoid X-ray detection, it makes them easy to conceal and smuggle.

'These
 could be the next generation of firearms and a lot more work needs to 
be done to understand the technology and the scale of the problem.

'If
 what we have seized today can, as we suspect, be used to make a genuine
 firearm then today will be an important milestone in the fight against 
this next generation of homemade weapons.

'I would strongly urge anyone who has information about the whereabouts of a gun in their community to call us.'

Finished product: A fully-assembled plastic gun made by a printer would look similar to this

Intricate: Each of the components would have been made individually in the machine before being put together using nails and household screws

Risk: In May, Mail on Sunday reporter Simon Murphy was able to get one of the weapons through security checks and onto the Eurostar

The world's first gun made with 3D printer technology was successfully fired in the USA earlier this year.

The controversial group who manufactured the gun, Defense Distributed, group spent a year trying to create the firearm, which was successfully tested at a firing range south of Austin, Texas.

According to the group's website Defense Distributed is a 'non-profit corporation in the state of Texas, organised and operated exclusively for charitable and literary purposes'.

The group says their main aims are: 'To defend the civil liberty of popular access to arms as guaranteed by the United States Constitution and affirmed by the United States Supreme Court, through facilitating global access to, and the collaborative production of, information and knowledge related to the 3D printing of arms; and to publish and distribute, at no cost to the public, such information and knowledge in promotion of the public interest.'

The gun was made on a 3D printer that cost £5,140 from the online auction site eBay.It was assembled from separate printed components made from plastic - only the firing pin was made from metal.

Defense Distributed is headed by Cody Wilson, a 25-year-old law student at the University of Texas.Earlier this year Mr Wilson told the BBC: 'I think a lot of people weren't expecting that this could be done.'

Mr Wilson, who describes himself as a crypto-anarchist, said his plans to make the design available were 'about liberty'.

He told the BBC: 'There is a demand of guns - there just is. There are states all over the world that say you can't own firearms - and that's not true any more.'I'm seeing a world where technology says you can pretty much be able to have whatever you want. It's not up to the political players any more."

Asked if he felt any sense of responsibility about whose hands the gun might fall into, he told the BBC: "I recognise the tool might be used to harm other people - that's what the tool is - it's a gun.

'But I don't think that's a reason to not do it - or a reason not to put it out there.'

3D printing has been hailed as the future of manufacturing.

The technology works by building up layer upon layer of material - typically plastic - to build complex solid objects

Violence: An member of Defense Distributed fired the 'The Liberator' gun for the first time in May
