A woman who made waves online for a webcam video that allegedly depicted her engaged in a sex act at a university library is now facing a public indecency charge.

A Benton County court document charged Kendra Sunderland with the misdemeanor crime, it emerged Tuesday.

It stated 'The defendant, on or about January 27, 2015, did and with the intent of arousing the sexual desire of defendant or another person, expose her genitals; contrary to statute and against the peace and dignity of the State of Oregon.'

Video: Kendra Sunderland allegedly appeared in an explicit video filmed at an Oregon State University library

Legal issues: Sunderland is now facing a public indecency act over the video 

Webcam: The video allegedly shows the 19-year-old sitting at a table inside the school library, masturbating and flashing the camera

The document - obtained and published by the Smoking Gun on Tuesday - accused Sunderland of committing public indecency on the sixth floor of Valley Library at Oregon State University (OSU).

According to the Smoking Gun, Sunderland may be forced to pay a $6250 fine and spend as much as one year in prison. Her arraignment is planned for Thursday, the website reported. 

The video reportedly shows the 19-year-old masturbating and flashing the camera.

An Oregon State Police media/desk log written by Trooper Christopher Graves said 'On January 27, 2015 at approximately 2:30pm I was tasked to looking into a complaint of a video of a female that was posted to a pornographic site claiming that the solo act that was being performed occured [sic] in the Oregon State University library. I was able to identify the suspect as the female [redacted]. The suspect was cited for Public Indecency [sic] and released.' 

The log was obtained and published by the Oregonian in January.  

Daily Mail Online earlier reported that Sunderland, who once attended OSU, is behind the website Date Broke College Girls. 

'I created this site to match college girls like me who are struggling to pay for school and looking for a rich older boyfriend,' she wrote online. 'Hopefully this will keep them from getting naked in the library and help them use it to study!' 

New career: Sunderland began performing in webcam videos during a failed job search in Fall 2013 for a waitress position, when she was still a OSU student

Business venture: Sunderland is behind the website Date Broke College Girls and appears on the homepage

In early February, the New York Daily News reported that Sunderland began performing in webcam videos during a failed job search in Fall 2013 for a waitress position, when she was still a OSU student.

'Working a minimum wage job, there's people that are just mean to you when they're having a crappy day,' Sunderland told the newspaper. 'On MyFreeCams, [users] had nothing but nice things to say. And I made way more than I would working any other job.'

The New York Daily News reported that Sunderland made approximately $700 from filming the on-campus webcam video in October, before soon leaving school and making more videos.

A spokesman for OSU told the newspaper Sunderland was banned from school grounds.

A MyFreeCams attorney also told the New York Daily News that Sunderland's video violated the guidelines for the website, and she is banned.

Early Wednesday, Sunderland posted a selfie on Facebook, captioning it 'Up early today for another huge day in the Lady Boss empire!!'

She also published a post asking for assistance from OSU fraternity members.

The post read 'Dear Oregon State Frat Brothers I need your help, comment here and we will DM...and please no dumb replies, this is a serious issue regarding my court date tomorrow.' 

That message has since been deleted.

Daily Mail Online has reached out to the Benton County District Attorney's office for comment.

Sunderland and her attorney did not respond to requests for comment. A publicist for Sunderland said a comment would be made after the Thursday arraignment.
