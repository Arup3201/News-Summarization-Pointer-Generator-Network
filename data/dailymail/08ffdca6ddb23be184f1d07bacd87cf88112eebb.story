Brides who dream of a glitzy rock star-style wedding venue need look no further for the perfect location.

Former Police singer Sting and his wife Trudie Styler have opened up their vast estate in Tuscany for weddings and private parties.

But Sting's loss of privacy comes at a price -  his six cottages housing 50 guests will cost seven thousand euros (£6,000) a week each to rent.

Up to 200 partygoers will be able to enjoy the 900-acre Italian estate's attractions which include a large swimming pool, a giant chess board in the garden, bee hives and its own, woods, lake and kitchen garden.

Il Palagio, the couple's 16th century villa, which is 45 minutes southeast of Florence in the Chianti region, produces wine, olive oil and honey.

Guests will be able to dine in the wine cellar which is lined with 'enormous ancient barrels' says the Italian estate agency Immobiliare.

Since buying the run-down estate in 1999, Sting has renovated property and bought more land from the previous owner, Duke Simone Vincenzo Velluti di San Clemente.

He put a 10ft statue of Buddha in the chapel at the main house.

Sting's decision to open the doors of his home to the public may have been prompted by new property tax laws introduced by the hard-pressed Italian government.

Immobiliare spokesman Andrea Polo told the Daily Telegraph: I don't know how much money you can make selling honey, but with the new tax Sting will have been handed a huge housing tax bill last year.

'It is a lovely property, so it is clear the place will be in demand. String is so unconventional and doesn't live in an ivory tower so he might show up at your event.'

On Sting's website,wines like When we Dance are promoted along with Thousand Flowers honey and the property's Il Palagio olive oil.

He has opened a shop on the estate offering his products including salami which is made from a local breed of pig.
