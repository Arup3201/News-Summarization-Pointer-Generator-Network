Charged: Keelen Armstrong, 24, has been arrested and charged in connection with the shooting of toddler Londyn Samuels

Police in crime-riddled New Orleans have arrested and charged a 24-year-old man in connection with the fatal shooting of a toddler who was being carried home from a park.

Keelen Armstrong has been booked with first-degree murder in the slaying 
of 13-month-old Londyn Samuels. He was also booked with attempted 
first-degree murder in the wounding of the child's caretaker.

Londyn was being carried by her 
18-year-old nanny on their way home from the park when someone opened 
fire on the teen. One of the bullets entered the baby sitter's back and 
then struck the toddler in the chest, killing her.

The tragic shooting left the New Orleans community reeling after it happened at around 8.20pm on Thursday, August 29, in the city centre.

Mayor Mitch Landrieu declared that 'enough is enough' after the shooting in a city struggling with violence.

Londyn's heartbroken father, Keion Reed, 20, got a frantic call from his daughter's wounded baby sitter on the night of the shooting telling him that she and the one-year-old had been shot.

'In the back of my head, this is a bad dream I haven't woken up from yet,' Mr Reed told NBC News.

Ironically,
at the time of the attack, Londyn's mother, 22-year-old Andrea 
Samuels, was working at a non-profit cafe promoting anti-violence.

Mayor Landrieu and his police chief appealed for 
the public's help in finding the person responsible for the shooting 
death of the 13-month-old girl.

Innocent victim: Londyn Samuels, age 1, was shot dead while being carried by her 18-year-old baby sitter on a New Orleans street

Sunny baby: Described by her loved ones as a joy and a blessing, little Londyn was just starting to learn her to walk 

‘This
community has got to stand up and with force and power, speak with one 
voice and say this is unacceptable,’ a somber Landrieu said at an 
afternoon news conference. He announced plans for an evening vigil at an intersection near where Londyn Samuels was killed.

The
shooting happened in the Central City neighborhood, one of the hotspots
for crime that has marred the city's recovery from Hurricane Katrina. 

Police
Chief Ronal Serpas said he was surprised at the lack of tips to 
Crimestoppers, which offers rewards and promises anonymity to people who
phone in information.

‘We know that people in our community know more than they are telling us,’ Serpas said. ‘We would ask the people of New Orleans that know something about this to ask yourself, “What kind of a man would shoot at a woman holding a child?” That's not the kind of person you want to protect.’

'Persons of interest': New Orleans police released these grainy photos from a surveillance video showing people walking past the crime scene where Londyn and her nanny were shot

Stand-off: Members of the New Orleans Police Department SWAT team move toward an apartment on the 2800 block of LaSalle in New Orleans after three people refused to cooperate with the shooting investigation

The 18-year-old baby sitter and little Londyn were returning home at 8.20pm Thursday when two shots rang out near the intersection of Washington Avenue and South Saratoga Street.

The nanny suffered a non-life threatening wound to the back and was able to reach a neighbor's home and call for help. The motive for the shooting was unknown.

Londyn's relatives described her as a happy baby who loved music and food, and was just starting to learn how to walk.

‘She was playful. She was a joy and a blessing,’ her aunt Ashley Samuels told NOLA.com.

As police officers fanned out throughout the neighborhood to question local residents overnight, two woman and a man were taken in for questioning following a four-hour standoff with a SWAT team in an apartment building in the 2800 block of LaSalle Street.

A $5,000 reward is being offered by Crimestoppers. Police issued images from a surveillance video that shows two people — described as ‘persons of interest’ — walking past a house in the area of the shooting.

Tragic trend: Londyn, pictured left with her father and right with her aunt, is the fourth child to be killed in Central City neighborhood since 2010 

Mayor Landrieu, who made the fight against violent crime a major issue in his 2010 campaign, said the city has had some success in cutting the murder rate, noting that there have been 97 so far this year, down from 130 at the same point last year.

But he said the death of child demonstrates the need for more community involvement.

Since 2010, three children between the ages of one and five fell victim to gun violence in the Central City section of New Orleans.

‘It is a lifestyle of murder and death,’ said Brother Walter Umrani, a community activist who patrols the inner-city neighborhood with his New Orleans Peace Keepers, reported the station WWLTV.
