Krispy Kreme has a new creation and it's sure to both warm and clog the hearts of all who try it.

Krispy Kreme has partnered with a minor league baseball team in Delaware called the Wilmington Blue Rocks to design a hot dog topped with bacon and raspberry jam inside of a glazed donut bun.

The donut company has yet to reveal the nutritional details of its latest addition but its likely high in fat, calories, cholesterol, and flavor.

The finger licking concoction will be available at the stadium next month and the baseball team is asking fans to give the treat a name.

Eat me: Krispy Kreme has partnered with a minor league baseball team in Delaware called the Wilmington Blue Rocks to design a hot dog topped with bacon and raspberry jam inside of a glazed donut bun

'What name would you give this salty-and-sweet creation: a hot dog covered with raspberry jam and bacon served on a Krispy Kreme donut bun?' asks the team's website.

So far a few of the suggestions on Twitter have been the 'Kremey Weenie' or 'Rocky's Sweet Meats,' by tweeter Spencer Graves.

Entries will be accepted until March 17 and six names will be selected as finalists.

While the hot dog will only have one name, all six finalists will win four passes to a Blue Rocks game in the coming season.

The voting will occur until March 24 at 5 p.m.

Some suggestions: 'Kremey Weenie' and 'Rocky's Sweet Meats' were among the names suggested for the hot dog creation that if successful, may end up in Krispy Kreme stores nationwide

KSAT reports that if the hot dog is a hot seller that Krispy Kreme may start selling it in their stores nationwide in the hopes of attracting more customers.

Shares of Krispy Kreme fell nearly 6 per cent on Thursday and the company reported that its latest quarterly sales missed predictions.

Brian Sozzi, an analyst for Belus Capital Advisors, told CNN that investors should not ignore this growth.

'Krispy Kreme, amidst outcries by people to fast food companies to use antibiotic free chicken and beef, organic veggies, and remove sugar and salt content, just baked up nicely positive sales, ‘he said.

The Blue Rocks are not the only baseball team introducing new menu items.

Just last week, the Arizona Diamondbacks premiered a churro hot dog called the Churro Dog.

What stadium's  savory creation will be next?

Sold here: The hot dog will be sold at the Wilmington Blue Rocks' stadium in Delaware
