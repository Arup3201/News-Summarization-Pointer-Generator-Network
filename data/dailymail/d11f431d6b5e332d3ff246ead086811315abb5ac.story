Lewis Holtby has agreed to join Hamburg on a season-long loan. 

Holtby signed for Spurs in January 2013 from Schalke but has struggled to establish himself in the starting line-up at White Hart Lane.

A six-month loan spell at Fulham last term proved unsuccessful as the Cottagers were relegated to the Championship and manager Felix Magath criticised the 23-year-old's attitude.

German experience: Holtby has been frustrated by a lack of first-team opportunities at Tottenham 

Mauricio Pochettino's arrival as Spurs head coach offered renewed hope for the midfielder, but, despite a promising pre-season, Holtby has not started any of the club's three Barclays Premier League matches so far.

Holtby has scored one goal for Tottenham in 25 league appearances.

Hamburg's director of sport Dietmar Beiersdorfer told hsv.de: 'Lewis has great passing ability and he is going to do us good with his creativity.

'He's just 23 but he already has a great deal of experience in the Bundesliga, the Premier League as well as in Europe and he should now bring that experience here with him.'

Decisions: The German has headed home to sign a season-long loan deal with Hamburg

Hamburg started the season with a 0-0 draw at Cologne and a 3-0 home defeat to Paderborn at the weekend.

That loss has turned up the heat on coach Mirko Slomka, who successfully saved them from relegation via a play-off last season.
