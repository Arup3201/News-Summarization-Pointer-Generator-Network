Two suspected bank robbers - one wearing a very apt slogan on his T-shirt - have been arrested after blowing a large amount of cash at a casino.

Officers in Lewiston, Idaho, received a anonymous tip-off that someone matching the description of a robber was laying down wads of cash.

It followed a bank robbery in Cottonwood on Friday.

Suspect: Police arrested 35-year-old Rocky Fisher (left), of Nampa, and 19-year-old Jennifer Balfe (right), of Meridian, at 11am on Sunday

Police arrested 35-year-old Rocky Fisher, of Nampa, and 19-year-old Jennifer Balfe, of Meridian, at 11am on Sunday.

The pair were walking out of a motel room in Lewiston together and Fisher wore a T-shirt saying: 'It's all fun and games until the cops show up.'

Cottonwood Police Chief Terry Cochran says they were both booked into jail on Sunday evening on suspicion of robbery, burglary and grand theft.

Lewiston police say officials are investigating whether Fisher and Balfe may also be responsible for bank robberies that took place on May 9 and May 14 in Ontario, Oregon.

No one has been charged in those robberies.
