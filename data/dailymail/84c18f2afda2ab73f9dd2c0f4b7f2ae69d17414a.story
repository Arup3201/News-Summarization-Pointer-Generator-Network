Listen out in the 16th minute of Chelsea’s game against Schalke tonight and amid the usual din of the Veltins Arena there may be a ripple of applause and a chorus of 'One Di Matteo'.

Chelsea supporters treat their legends with respect. Remember how they sang for Frank Lampard at Manchester City, even after he had scored a late equaliser against them.

The 16th minute ovation in honour of Roberto Di Matteo’s shirt number became a staple of Chelsea games after he had been fired to make way for Rafa Benitez.

It might not go down too well with Jose Mourinho and it might be uncomfortable for those in the posh seats who sacked him, but two thousand or so expected to make the trip from London are sure to hail Di Matteo.

He was, after all, not only a popular former player but the man in in charge (albeit on an interim basis) on the greatest night in the club’s history, when they beat Bayern Munich on penalties to win the Champions League.

The Swiss-born former Italy international was dismissed six months later and spent two years out of the game, devoting time to his family while doing media work, watching games and studying football.

Schalke moved after sacking Jens Keller. The appointment was confirmed on October 7 and he won his first game against Hertha Berlin.

'This is a big club,' said Di Matteo. 'It has a big fan base and a very good squad. I’ve always enjoyed the Bundesliga. I just had the feeling it was the right move to take on this challenge.' 

He is the club’s seventh manager since 2008, a difficult period during which the club from Gelsenkirchen have had to watch the rise and rise of their fierce rivals Borussia Dortmund.

Having been raised in the German-speaking part of Switzerland, Di Matteo has no language barriers and he has arrived with a certain status as a former Champions League winning boss.

The 44-year-old will not be paid anything like the £130,000 a week he earned at Chelsea - and continued to earn during his time out - but this move is all about returning to the competitive world and developing his education as a coach.

Like many new managers who arrive with the transfer window closed, the first thing Di Matteo did was to claim the players might be in better shape and launch into a fitness drive.

Schalke have won four and lost three since his appointment - the victories have all come in the Veltins – and after a dreadful injury-hit start to the campaign have started to creep up the Bundesliga table.

Injuries are still interfering with his plans. Julian Draxler will not play against Chelsea after pulling a thigh muscle, 11 seconds into the game against Wolfsburg, last weekend. Sead Kolasinac and Jefferson Farfan are long-term injury absentees.

The 3-2 win against Wolfsburg eased Schalke up to seventh in the league, but defeat against Sporting Lisbon in Portugal earlier this month means their place in the knock-out stages of the Champions League is far from secure. Sporting are at home to Maribor of Slovenia on Tuesday night.

'We won on Saturday, we’re playing at home and morale is good,' said Di Matteo. 'There are positives for us to tap into. But we’re playing an unbeaten opponent and we have to give our best performance. They play very well as a team together, so we have to play at our maximum.'

Roman Abramovich pulled the trigger on Di Matteo because of doubts about his tactical acumen and coaching experience at the very top level. Benitez did not work out but with Mourinho back and Chelsea on top of the Barclays Premier League it is a happy vibe at the club again.

Di Matteo may never persuade everyone that the 2012 Champions League triumph was down to him. In fact, he doesn’t try.

Like others, he prefers to give credit to Chelsea’s players for salvaging the tie against Napoli, defying the odds to beat Barcelona despite playing more than half of the second leg of the tie in the Nou Camp with 10 men and beating Bayern in their own stadium.

The final in the Allianz Arena will always be remembered for three penalty saves by Petr Cech and Didier Drogba’s header and winning spot kick, rather than any tactical brilliance by Di Matteo.

But this may be unfair. He produced a balanced team from an imbalanced squad at Chelsea and, with four key players suspended in the final, organised his side well and produced a surprise by using Ryan Bertrand on the left wing to add stability.

Roman Abramovich pulled the trigger on Di Matteo six months after Chelsea's Champions League triumph 

He also showed an ability to manage the big egos, which has become a sizeable part of the job at the elite level.

Not everyone in Germany is convinced Di Matteo is the man to revive this proud old club but he has a history of success as a player and a manager and an ability to influence the big occasions.

It will not be wise to completely rule out the idea he will be the first to inflict defeat on Chelsea this season.
