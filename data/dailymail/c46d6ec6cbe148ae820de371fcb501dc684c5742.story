It's one of the golden rules of top tennis players - keep your balls in your pocket.

Unfortunately for Andy Murray when his kept slipping out it became a problem that was always going to cause some chuckles.

The host's on Radio 4's Today programme were quick to join in the giggles as they discussed the technical glitch plaguing the Scot in Saturday's late-night encounter with Marcos Baghdatis.

'I've seen it happen before bet I've never seen it happen to Andy Murray so it was very unfortunate,' former British women's number one Annabel Croft told John Humphrys as they discussed the Mail Online's exclusive story that Murray was wearing new shorts after adidas investigated the matter.

There is no specific rule about balls falling out of a pocket but it comes under the hindrance law.

The law states that, if a player is hindered in playing a point by a deliberate act of an opponent, the player wins the point.

If unintentional or outside of the player's own control then the point is replayed.

When the ball fell out of Murray's pocket a second and third time it was no longer deemed 'outside of his control' and he lost the point.

The pair then proceeded to discuss the tightness of mens' tennis shorts in the past.

'John McEnroe had the obvious solution,' Mr Humphrys said.

'He was saying 'back in my days it couldn't have happened. Our shorts were so tight nothing could have come out''.'

Laughing loudly, Ms Croft said: 'That is true, mens' shorts in tennis have just changed shape do dramatically it's hard to believe what they used to play in because they used to be very, very tight, very short shorts, and they look quite uncomfortable when you look back on them.

'Now of course the players are rolling round on the court in these very baggy shorts down to their knees so it's a very different situation.'

Asked if she would be willing to be at the forefront of a campaign for player to bring back the tight old mens' shorts of yesteryear, she said: 'Definitely not. The shorts they were today look a lot more comfortable.'

The British No 1 saw the objects pop out of his pockets three times during the encounter. He was twice punished with lost points.

After taking up the problem with the German manufacturers adidas, Murray will
now wear a redesigned pair of shorts when he steps on to court for his 
fourth-round match against Croatia's Marin Cilic on Monday.

On Saturday the ball popped out three times, each at a critical stage.

The
first time it happened umpire Steve Ullrich ordered they replay the 
point, but on the latter two occasions the points went to Baghdatis.

While the first slip was allowed to go 
unpunished, after the second and third blunders the star was penalised 
under rules governing hindrance during play.

Murray,
sponsored by adidas since late 2009 in a £3m-a-year deal, has worn the 
brand's Barricade Short since the start of Wimbledon.

Baghdatis,
Fernando Verdasco and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga wear the machine-finished 
Barricade Bermuda shorts, which look almost identical but are longer.

The
German sportswear giant investigated the issue before issuing a 
statement, which read: 'Adidas works closely with Andy on the design of 
all his kit and we believe the issues were the result of an individual 
technical error in the handmade pockets of those shorts. Andy will now 
wear the Barricade Bermuda short.'

The sportswear manufacturer last night put the incidents down to human 
error, saying the pockets on the hand-finished shorts had been made too 
shallow.

Murray's progress towards Sunday's final could be further disrupted by the weather and his scheduling on Court No 1.

The fourth seed is due second on the uncovered show court and heavy rain is forecast.

If Murray's match against Cilic cannot be completed, the Scot would be forced into playing on consecutive days.

At least Murray's shorts shouldn't trouble him.

After Andy Murray's tennis ball mishap, I put a replica pair of Murray's shorts to the test…

On
Murray Mount, I ran a series of 15-metre sprints, side-stepped a bit 
and jumped up and down on the spot for 60 seconds but I was unable to 
dislodge a ball from the pockets on Sunday.

It was only when I violently wiggled my legs that I could get the ball to nudge even slightly.

Murray's thighs are at least double the size of mine but the key difference was the pockets on my shop-bought shorts (for £30) were finished correctly.

Perhaps Andy should have nipped down the High Street.
