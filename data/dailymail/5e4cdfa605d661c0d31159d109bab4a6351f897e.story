Sloped roof means 600 fans won't be able to see teenager's full routine in 10m diving events

Nearly 5,000 ticket holders affected across eight sessions of diving

Big television screens in the arena are their only hope of seeing all the action

They are some of the hottest tickets of the London 2012 Olympics - but many fans who splashed out £50 to see home favourite Tom Daley in action are in for a shock.

The sloping roof at the Aquatics Centre means hundreds of spectators in the top section of  a bank of temporary seating will find their view blocked.

As these pictures show, the roof obstructs the top of the 10m diving board, meaning unlucky spectators won't be able to see the most spectacular flips and twists of Tom's routine. They will only be able to see the home favourite's entry into the water.

Diving fans who forked out up to £50 to watch Tom Daley from these seats in the Aquatics Centre won't be able to see much of his routine

Daley, 18, will compete alongside 
Pete Waterfield in the 10m synchronised platform event. The pair are 
hotly tipped to win gold on Monday July 30.

They will both also compete individually in the 10m synchronised event, which takes place over two days on August 10 and 11.

Those with tickets in the upper section of the arena for the women's 10m events will also be affected.

The team event - featuring British athletes Tonia Crouch and Sarah 
Barrow - takes place on July 31, with the individual competition on 
August 8 and 9. 

Fans with tickets to the 3m springboard events should get a clear view from all seats.

In total, eight sessions of diving events will be affected by the obstruction, meaning nearly 5,000 ticket holders will have an obstructed view.

LOCOG sold tickets to Olympic events without allowing fans to choose their seats from a plan, instead entering successful applicants into a ballot based on the price bracket they had selected.

It has been reported that fans who bought AA tickets for the diving for £450 were seated more than 40m away from the board, while those who bought £185 category C tickets were closer.

The dives will be shown live on big television screens around the arena.

There were similar issues with the 100m athletics final. Some fans had paid £725 for AA-tier tickets in the belief they would get a prime seat, only to find their ticket was for the opposite side of the stadium.

A LOCOG spokesman said: 'It was always
the intention to have a reduced capacity for Diving in the Aquatics Centre and
the designers worked around this requirement.

'We have sold
up to 600 tickets for the 10m platform diving sessions (there are eight
sessions in total), which may not have a full view of each dive.

'We put these
tickets on sale after the test event, once we had tested these seats and were
satisfied with the spectator viewing experience.

'There may be
a small part of the dive which the spectators in these seats can’t see. It is
only a very small component – and they can view the whole dive on the big
screen.

'We are in the
process of emailing spectators who have these tickets to explain – and we are
happy to give a full refund if they are not happy.

'There were
several thousand seats in the wings of the Aquatics Centre which we haven’t
sold as part of the planned reduction in capacity.

'There
is huge public interest in diving. All the seats we have sold have a view of
the pool and the divers. A very small number of seats cannot see the whole of
each dive, but have a good view of the big screens. We believe this will still
be a great experience in a great atmosphere.'

Nick Trythall, who has bought four of
 the £50 tickets for the men's 10m final on August 11, said: 'I am 
totally appalled by this information.

'I now wonder if under some form of 
trading standards/disclosure legal agreement that it would not be 
appropriate for LOCOG to offer full refunds to purchasers of a ticket to
 an event that they will not in fact be able to see?

'I am not clear from the slightly 
contradictory comments by LOCOG as to whether 'all' £50 tickets are 
unable to see the actual 10m board, or whether this applies to 'some' 
£50 tickets which would have an obstructed view but as would be normal 
in the theatre.

'Why was this information not disclosed prior to to these particular tickets being made available for sale?

'In fact why is it that with just 
days to go there are no seating plans available for any of the stadiums 
in use? Perhaps we now know the answer to that question!'
