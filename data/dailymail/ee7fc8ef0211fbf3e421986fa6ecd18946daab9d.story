A wife went on trial today accused of goading her lover into killing her husband to avoid an expensive custody battle over their young children.

Morgan Marie Mengel, 35, convinced 21-year-old Stephen Shappell to take part in her alleged murder plot to batter Kevin Mengel, 34, to death with a shovel in Chester County, Philadelphia.

The jury will then hear how Mengel tried to persuade her lover to take the full blame for the murder by pretending she had given birth to his twins while in prison.

Prosecutors plan to introduce letters in which Mengel allegedly asked Shappell to exonerate her from the murder as she had to bring up their children.

Mengel described her labour and pregnancy and even the infants weight and eye colour to Shappell in a bid to convince him not to implicate her in her husband's murder.

Shappell is set to be the star prosecution witness having already pleaded guilty to murder.

Mengel and Shappell started their affair after having met at the landscaping business Morgan ran with her husband.

She is alleged to have first tried to poison her husband by putting liquid nicotine into his Snapple drink.

When that failed, Shappell bludgeoned him to death with a shovel. Mr Mengel's body was buried behind the 21-year-old's former high school in June 2010.

Mengel is alleged to have sent text messages and even updated her husbandâ€™s Facebok page to make it appear that he had walked out on his family.

Prosecutors say Mengel had been trying to make her husband 'vanish' for two years prior to his murder and in 2008 attempted to poison him with sleeping pills.

Several witnesses were being lined up to say how Morgan Mengel hated her husband.

She had also reportedly said divorce was not an option because she did not want a custody fight over their three children Mercedes, now 12, Kevin ten and six-year-old Billy.
