Police are hunting a gang of rustlers who are believed to have shot six pigs with crossbows to try and kill them for meat.

Farmer Jimmy Butler, 66, was horrified when he found three of his pregnant sows impaled with 14-inch crossbow bolts.

Another two of his free-range pigs were missing after apparently being killed and taken from his field in Blythburgh, Suffolk.

Sickening: The pigs were all pregnant and the wounds will have caused them tremendous stress

A sixth pig had an open wound, suggesting it had also been shot and the bolt had fallen out of its body.

Mr Butler who owns Blythburgh Free Range Pigs, said: 'It was distressing for my men, it was distressing for anyone who had to deal with it and most of all it was distressing for the pigs.

'It just makes you so angry because it's a wanton act of vandalism and the real ones to suffer are the pigs - what is the point of it?'

'The people who did this are just mindless individuals. They are no better than animals. It is just absolutely horrendous.

'The pigs would have suffered enormous stress. It was awful to see these darts sticking out of them.

'One had two bolts in its neck and the other two and one each in their sides. We will treat them with penicillin and they should recover.

'But the one with the open wound is very poorly and is likely to lose her piglets.'

Four of the animals were found on Saturday with arrows imbedded in them and two other pigs are thought to have been killed and stolen

Mr Butler said his company supplied pork to some of Britain's top restaurants such as the Ivy and Savoy in London.

He believes the pigs were targeted between 5pm last Friday and 5am on Saturday when his workers checked on them.

The pigs were among a group of about 50 in an open pen in a field containing more than 500 of the animals. Each was a pregnant sow weighing 150kg to 200kg.

A Suffolk Police spokesman said: 'We are appealing for information from anyone who saw anything suspicious.'
