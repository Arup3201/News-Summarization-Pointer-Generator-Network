An asylum seeker has pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a teenager on Sydney's Anzac Bridge.

The 19-year-old woman, who cannot be named, was walking along the bridge with headphones at about 2am on January 16 when she was approached by Amir Mohebbifar.

Mohebbifar asked her if she was walking home and then began following her, according to facts tendered to Central Local Court on Tuesday.

Despite Mohebbifar attempts to strike a conversation, the young woman refused to make eye contact and walked fast to try and 'remove herself from the situation', reported The Daily Telegraph.

Despite initially thinking she had got away from the attacker, the teenager heard footsteps approaching as Mohebbifar ran at her.

He then put his hand on her shoulder, to which the teenager responded by asking Mohebbifar what he was doing.

At this point he pulled the woman back by the shoulder and despite trying to get away, MohebbifarÂ  pushed the her up against a metal barrier and grabbed her arms.

He then tired to kiss the teen, who repeatedly told him to 'stop it' and to go away but the 26-year-old said: 'Why not? What do you mean?'.

He then pushed her into a bush off the bridge and despite her screaming, he pinned her against the barrier and squeezed her breasts through her clothing during the sexual assault.

The attack became more violent despite pleas from the victim for him to stop and the teenager's attempts to free herself, according to prosecutors and court papers.

As the nature of the attack worsened, Mohebbifar suddenly stopped and walked towards Pyrmont.

After the attack, the teenager immediately called triple-zero, prompting the attacker to run.

Within an hour police found Mohebbifar 'hiding under a car, sweating profusely and breathing heavily' by using CCTV footage.

The woman was taken to hospital for treatment and her DNA was found under the attacker's fingernails.

The asylum seeker pleaded guilty to one count of aggravated sexual assault. The charges of sexual intercourse without consent and indecent assault were withdrawn.

Court papers show Mohebbifar was on Christmas Island from March 2013, and in May he was granted a bridging visa which was set to expire in November 2013.

He had been living in Sydney for about nine months after arriving in Australia by boat from Iran.

His matter will return to court at a later date.
