A tongue-in-cheek cartoon depicting an online dating escapade of a girl named Tinderella has become a YouTube sensation, attracting four and a half million views. 

The hilarious clip, created by Collegehumor.com, shows a couple finding 'love' on dating app Tinder in the style of a fairy tale.

Like her namesake, Tinderella is also looking for her Prince Charming, but that's where the similarities between the two leading ladies end.

A modern-day fairy tale about dating called Tinderella has attracted millions of views on YouTube. The story begins: 'ere once was a beautiful girl, who was known to swipe left all day, until she found a charming prince, who was only a mile away'

The ideal man for Tinderella pops up on her screen. It's a match made in heaven!

Instead of donning a gown and corset for her big night out, Tinderella squeezes into a pair of control tights and flashes a big tattoo on her bicep.

She goes to The Ball, the name of a scummy nightclub, to meet her date. But as night falls, it's not only her shoe that slips off.

Unlike her namesake, Tinderella's idea of 'happily ever after' is never having to see her Prince charming again. 

So, she sneaks off at the crack of dawn while her 'true love' is still snoring. 

 

The narrator, who tells the tale with Disney style intonation, says 'their courtship did blossom', which is illustrated with a very short messaging conversation between the couple before they decide to hook up

The narrator, who tells the tale with Disney style intonation, starts by saying: 'There once was a beautiful girl, who was known to swipe left all day, until she found a charming prince, who was only a mile away.'

She then says 'their courtship did blossom', which in this fairy tale involves a very short messaging conversation. 

Prince charming messages 'Sup?' to Tinderella, who replies saying 'Hey'. The prince then woos her with the line 'Meet up?'. Swept off her feet Tinderella replies,'K'.

Before heading to The Ball nightclub, Tinderella punches a mouse in the face for suggesting she shows more cleavage, but then disaster strikes when her phone battery dies before she has found her man. 

Tinderella has to go through a few duds before finding her prince charming - including a married man and one wielding a knife

But determined for his happy ending, Prince Charming uses a Tinder selfie to find his date.

The cartoon then cuts rather abruptly to the bedroom scene, which for these two characters, is their fairy tale ending complete. 

So how does this fairy tale end? 'She snuck out that morning, at half past four, and they lived happily ever after, because they never spoke again.'
