Chelsea striker Diego Costa has revealed he nearly signed for Liverpool before moving to Stamford Bridge.

The Blues frontman has impressed since his £32million summer move from Atletico Madrid and is the Premier League's joint-top scorer alongside Sergio Aguero on 17 goals.

However, the Brazilian-born Spain international could have been playing for Liverpool after the Merseyside club triggered a £20m release clause in his contract in 2013.

The striker instead stayed with Atletico and scored 27 goals to help Diego Simeone's side beat Barcelona and Real Madrid to the La Liga title last season.

Since arriving in England, Costa has clashed with Liverpool defender Martin Skrtel and also missed three games for a stamp on Reds midfielder Emre Can. 

Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Costa said: 'I was close to leaving Atletico.'

'Liverpool are a great team, but after fighting so hard and overcoming difficulties to get my place at Atletico, how could I leave?

'I thought it was very important to keep growing with Atletico and to play there for many years.'
