Bungling social services allowed a convicted paedophile to subject two young girls to a five-year abuse ordeal, a damning report has revealed.

The man carried out a series of sickening attacks on his victims, including rape and sexual assault, some of which he filmed, after Devon County Council failed to intervene.

Seven members of the council's social services department have left since the scandal and a serious case review has now found 'severe flaws' in the way the situation was handled.

Serious case review: The man assaulted the girls over a five-year period because of failures by social services in Devon (file picture)

The man was jailed after pleading guilty to several counts of raping one girl, sexual activity with another and making and taking indecent images of children and was jailed at Exeter Crown Court .

He had previously been convicted of an indecent assault on a girl and was sent on a treatment course at a psychiatric hospital as part of a community order. He was also placed on the sex offenders' register.

But a report by Devon Safeguarding Children Board has now found he was later allowed to go on abusing children due to a catelogue of errors by social services, who failed to protect the girls.

The report, published yesterday, stated: 'The local authority did not effectively fulfill its duty to make inquiries into whether the children were likely to suffer significant harm.

'There appears to have been an insufficient knowledge and understanding of sex offending, offender profiles and the resultant risks to children by the investigating social workers and their front-line managers.'

The report also said that information 
about the man's previous offending - which would have revealed 'both the
 level and nature of risk' he posed to children - was not accessed by 
social workers.

'Key 
linkages, which could have given insight into the abuse being 
perpetrated, were not made between the various signs and symptoms being 
displayed behaviourally by the children,' the report said.

The board found there was 'insufficient knowledge' of the man's history on the part of social workers.

Despite his records being available five years before he was finally convicted, the documents were not accessed by the council.

Socially workers failed to interview the man when initially called to investigate the case.

Links between 'signs and symptoms' of abuse were not made by the authorities.

Social workers relied on the testimony of others and failed to speak to the man on three separate occasions.

The report added: 'Opportunities were missed at a number of points to take a fresh look at the case and consider the implications of the children's behaviour until the NSPCC became involved in 2012.

'As with many earlier serious case reviews, this case file review points to information being held in disparate places and to no single agency or collaboration of agencies understanding the full picture.

'It seems that the schools and others involved the social work services and the police appropriately, but the investigation/assessment that followed was not broad enough and resulted in inadequate safeguarding.

'The outcomes of some initial assessments were either not shared or, not fully shared with other agencies and this may have impaired multi-agency understanding of risk.'

In May 2013, Devon County Council's child protection services were rated inadequate by the regulator Ofsted.

In response, the authority set up an independent panel to oversee an improvement in services.

A council spokesman said seven members of staff had left the authority but was unable to say whether they had been dismissed or resigned. The social worker involved with the children remains at the county council.

Councillor James McInnes, cabinet member for child protection, said: 'We failed these children and I can only apologise for that.

'We take on board all the recommendations that have been made but we have already reviewed and revised all our procedures and practice guidance to try to make sure that nothing like this can happen again.

'There was a serious failure of supervision and management in the system. A social worker made a mistake but the oversight of the case failed.

'No one involved in that oversight is still employed by Devon County Council.'
