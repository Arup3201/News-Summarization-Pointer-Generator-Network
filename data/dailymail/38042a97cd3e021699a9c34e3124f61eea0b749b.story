A brother and sister have survived six heart attacks between them.

Toby Jones, now six, was just four months old when he had his first heart attack and was diagnosed with a rare condition which causes muscle weakness.

His three-year-old sister, Jessica, also has the genetic condition and she had her first heart attack at just nine months old.

Melissa Jones, 31, says her children - Jessica and Toby - have had six heart attacks between them

Their mother, Melissa Jones, 31, said: ‘I’m so proud of my children, they are both such fighters.

‘To have to go through one heart attack is enough but for them to battle through six between them is incredible.’

She added: ‘I knew something was wrong with Toby when he was a few weeks old, he found it hard to breathe and eat.

‘It was a terrifying time, he had he first heart attack while at Leicester Royal Infirmary, when doctors were trying to establish the cause of all his problems.

‘It was horrendous seeing him lying there covered in tubes and wires, luckily doctors managed to restart his heart.’

Two months later he was diagnosed with congenital myasthenia syndrome.

CMS can cause deadly breathing problems which are triggered by fevers or infections.

Ms Jones, who lives in  Syston, Leicestershire, said: ‘When I became pregnant for the second time I knew there was a high chance that I could have another child affected by the genetic condition. But  not once did I contemplate terminating the pregnancy.

‘My fears were right and just three weeks after Jessica was born she was diagnoses with CMS.’

Jessica had her first heart attack in May 2011. Her mother knew something was wrong when she began choking and medics confirmed she’d had a heart attack.

She suffered a second one after getting pneumonia.

Between them, Toby and Jessica have spent almost three years of their lives in hospital.

They have had six heart attacks between them and are constantly picking up infections which can trigger the attacks.

Toby has had four attacks with his sister suffering two.

Ms Jones said: ‘In a strange way I was almost happy for Toby that his little sister was diagnosed with the same condition.

Ms Jones says she knew there was a strong chance Jessica would also have the condition but that she did not consider a termination when she found out she was pregnant

‘It meant that he had someone to relate to with his problems as he grew older, they are extremely close and help each other so much already.

‘I know they’ll probably have more attacks but we take each day at a time.

‘Despite their horrible illness they are the best kids in the world, they are so funny.

‘They don’t let their condition hold them back, they run around like normal children.

‘The condition is so rare doctors don’t know what the future holds but they are my little miracles and I have learnt to live with CMS and as a family we face the battles of the condition together.’
