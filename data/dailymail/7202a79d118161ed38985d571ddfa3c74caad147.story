Martin Luther King Day may be a national holiday to mark the civil rights leader’s birthday, but to Sarah Palin it was simply too good an opportunity to let pass without taking a swipe at President Obama.

The former vice presidential nominee used her Facebook and Twitter accounts to post the short message which first invoked King's famous I Have A Dream speech before she added a short message asking the president stop playing the race card.

‘Mr. President, in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. and all who commit to ending any racial divide, no more playing the race card,’ wrote Palin.

On Facebook, Palin's post has been liked more than 22,000 times, been shared more than 3,800 times and received more than 1,670 comments

Her post also included a photo of the stone in front of the 
steps leading to the Lincoln Memorial that mark the spot where King 
addressed the March On Washington in 1963.

The former Alaska governor turned political commentator and reality TV star, didn’t specify exactly how she thinks Obama is ‘playing the race card,’ but her controversial post comes just days after The New Yorker published an interview with the president.

In the article, which appears in the Jan 27 issue, Obama made reference to his current standing with white voters.

‘There's no doubt that there's some folks who just really dislike me because they don't like the idea of a black president,’ he said.

‘Now, the flip side of it is there are some black folks and maybe some white folks who really like me and give me the benefit of the doubt precisely because I’m a black president.’

On Facebook, Palin's post has been liked more than 22,000 times, been shared more than 3,800 times and received more than 1,670 comments.

Those comments cover a broad range of opinions from people who say they share her opinion to those who write that she is 'an embarrassment to white people everywhere.'

Obama won his second term in 2012 with an estimated 39 percent of the white vote, down from 43 percent of white voters in the 2008 election. Four years earlier Democrat nominee John Kerry received 41 percent of the white vote.
