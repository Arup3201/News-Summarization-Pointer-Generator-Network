Fashion designer Julien Macdonald, who once called plus-size models  ‘a joke’, is eating his words.

After losing more than a stone on Strictly Come Dancing last year, he’s now trying to bulk up.

Julien’s been topping up his diet  with NRG Fuel protein shakes and supplements, while cycling daily  and going to the gym three times a week. He is attempting to gain more muscle ahead of a 280-mile charity  bike ride next month.

Working hard: Designer Julien Macdonald lost more than a stone on Strictly Come Dancing but is now bulking up ahead for a 280-mile charity bike ride

‘I’ve committed to doing this marathon ride through Madagascar  in aid of ENABLE Scotland,’ says Julien.‘This is a huge physical challenge, so I need to prepare.’

On Britain’s Next Top Model, where he was Mr Nasty on the judging panel, Julien famously said that ‘if you’re a size 14 in a room full of size 8s, you’re in the wrong room’.

He later apologised, saying there was a gap in the market for curvier models. Maybe he’ll discover there’s a market for more flattering cycle clothing, too.

Sneaky: More than a quarter of people hide how much they use their phone from their partner

For those who queued round  the block to buy Apple’s new iPhone 6, take heed – new research has discovered that smartphone addiction is causing romantic strife.

A survey of 1,000 people, commissioned by musicMagpie, found that 41 per cent of couples bicker about the amount of time spent on their mobile phones.

As a result, more than a quarter of people hide how much they use their phone from their partner.

Psychotherapist Toni Mackenzie said: ‘Over recent years, mobile telephones have become psychologically addictive for  many users.

‘They can lead to people switching off from reality and missing out on what’s actually going on around them.’

A remarkable new serum has been found to start the healing process in cold sores within two days.

Herpatch Serum, which includes an ingredient derived from red algae, forms a thin transparent layer over the sore to protect it, preventing further infection and accelerating the healing process, claim the makers, Belgian skincare company Sylphar.

Without any treatment, cold sores – which are highly contagious and caused by the herpes simplex virus – will take about ten days to clear up. The Herpatch Serum  is available from Boots at £7.99.

Do you have an irrational fear of open spaces? Psychiatrists are calling for agoraphobics to take part in a six-month clinical trial at Roehampton University in London to develop an app to treat the condition. The severe anxiety disorder  can stop people leaving their homes and affects three to six per cent of the UK population.

Agoraphobia Free combines standard treatment Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with games.

Consultant psychiatrist Dr Andres Fonseca, founder of tech company Virtually Free, says: ‘As sufferers are often unable to attend clinics,  this is the best way to enable them to access therapy.’ To take part, email news@virtually-free.com
