Arsenal breezed past struggling Aston Villa to secure all three points in a 5-0 win at the Emirates Stadium.

Santi Cazorla yet again proved the creative hub of the team, grabbing two assists and a goal in the thrashing.

Here, Sportsmail's Sami Mokbel rates each player as Arsene Wenger's side put pressure on fourth placed Southampton ahead of their game with Swansea. 

ARSENAL

David Ospina – Made a crucial save to deny Weimann in the first half and his handling was top notch. 7

Hector Bellerin – Provided attacking impetus down the right hand side and was sound enough defensively. Excellent goal, too. 7.5

Per Mertesacker – Moving towards his dominant best after his slow start to the season. Still room for improvement, though. 7

Laurent Koscielny – The Gunners back four looks far more secure since the Frenchman's return from an achilles injury. 7.5

Nacho Monreal – In the best form of his Arsenal career. Another excellent shift down Arsenal's left side. 7

Francis Coquelin – What has happened to the Frenchman. He looks every inch the midfield anchorman the Gunners have been craving for. 7.5

Aaron Ramsey – Very busy in the Gunners engine room but still short of last season's match-winning displays. 7

Theo Walcott – Looked a little rusty on his first Premier League start in over year – but still scored his second consecutive goal. 7

Santi Cazorla – At the hub of everything that was good about Arsenal's display. Incredibly creative in possession. 9

Mesut Ozil – A goal last week, another one and an outrageous flicked assist this. Are we finally seeing the real Ozil? 8.5

Olivier Giroud – Excellent finish to give Arsenal the lead and lead the line very well for the home side. 7

Subs: Rosicky (for Walcott) 6.5; Akpom (for Giroud) 7; Flamini (for Ramsey) 6.5.

Arsene Wenger – His side are in the groove now, about time too. Were unstoppable today. 7.5

ASTON VILLA

Brad Guzan – A busy afternoon for the keeper and did well to keep the score down. 6.5

Alan Hutton – Had no answer to Ozil's movement and intelligence. And afternnon the Scot will want to forget. 5.5

Ciaran Clark – Combative to the last but struggled to deal with Arsenal's expansive attacking options. 5.5

Jores Okore – Was given a difficult time by Giroud as the Villa's back-four were taught a lesson by the Gunners attack. 5.5

Kieran Richardson – Tried to inject some thrust down Villa's left but his efforts had little impact on the game. 6

Carlos Sanchez – Wasteful in possession on more than one occasion putting his side in unnecessary danger. 4

Fabian Delph – Wasn't lacking for effort but the quality in Arsenal's midfield was too much for the England international to contend with. 6

Tom Cleverley – Miserable afternoon for the midfielder. Struggled to get a foothold in the game and was replaced in the second half. 5

Carles Gil – Showed some moments of quality but it wasn't enough in a disappointing afternoon. 6

Andreas Weimann – Most telling contribution was squandering an excellent headed chance in the first half. Subbed. 5.5

Christian Benteke – Missed a couple of half chances at the start of the second half but, on the whole, was well shackled by Koscielny and Mertesacker. 6

Subs: Agbonlahor (for Cleverley) 5; Sinclair (for Weimann) 5; Westwood (for Sanchez) 5. 

Paul Lambert – His side threatened a response early in the second half but soon slipped back into their malaise. 5.5
