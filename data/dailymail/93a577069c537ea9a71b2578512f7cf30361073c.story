Wayne Rooney was at the centre of an injury mystery on Thursday after he left Manchester United’s training session early and was immediately sent for scans.

Sources close to the player claim that Rooney has been suffering from a stomach complaint but Sportsmail understands it could be more serious, and that explains why the club’s medical staff are so anxious to investigate further.

United will assess the 28-year-old’s condition on Friday before deciding if he can face Sunderland at home this weekend.

However, with little left to play for in their remaining three games of the season under interim boss Ryan Giggs, they are unlikely to risk Rooney if there is any doubt about his fitness.

The England striker will also be reluctant to take any chances with the World Cup looming next month after going into the last two tournaments under an injury cloud.

In 2006, Rooney arrived late in Germany after rushing to recover from the broken metatarsal he suffered in a Premier League defeat at Chelsea in April of that year. However, he struggled for match fitness and had a disappointing tournament, culminating in his sending-off in the quarter-final defeat to Portugal.

The 2010 World Cup in South Africa was equally difficult for Rooney after he damaged the ligaments in his right ankle in Champions League quarter-final against Bayern Munich in late March having scored his 34th goal of the season at the Allianz Arena.

He made it back to play in England’s three group games and the defeat to Germany that sent Fabio Capello’s side home early, but did not find the net again for club or country that season.

There were fears that lightning might have struck twice after Rooney suffered a chipped bone in his foot when United met Bayern in another Champions League quarter-final first leg a month ago, but he was able to play in the return game in Germany with the help of a painkilling injection and it is not believed to have troubled him since.

Now Roy Hodgson will be hoping that the latest scare is nothing more than a precaution with United anxious not to take any unnecessary risks.
