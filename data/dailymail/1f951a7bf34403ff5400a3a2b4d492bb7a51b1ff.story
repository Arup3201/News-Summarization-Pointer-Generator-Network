The Taylor Swift/Hottest 100 scandal has been reignited.

In the days leading up to the Australia Day poll, a social media campaign to have American pop artist Taylor Swift’s song Shake it Off win the poll stole the spotlight.

On the morning of the national countdown, Triple J announced Shake it Off was disqualified from the countdown, largely because it had never been played on the station.

But news has surfaced that the ninth-placed song on the countdown, Chandelier, by Australian artist Sia, also had never been played on the youth broadcaster either, reports Sydney Morning Herald.

The ninth-placed song on the countdown, Chandelier, by Australian artist Sia (left), had never been played on Triple J,  one of the chief reasons that Taylor Swift's (right) song Shake it Off was disqualified

Taylor Swift was disqualified for a number of reasons, including KFC's decision to offer a $19.89 voucher, in reference to the pop stars latest album 1989

An article on Tone Deaf called 'A Song Triple J Never Played Made The Hottest 100 Top 10 And Nobody Noticed' has reported that Triple J only ever played a cover of Chandelier, not the original song.

Chris Scadden, Triple J’s station manager, told Tone Def the song had been played on the station's DJ shows House Party and Mix Up.

"Triple J has been playing Sia for more than 15 years, since she was a young artist in Adelaide... we played 4-5 songs from her 1000 Forms Of Fear album on Triple J in 2014," he said.

He pointed out that by comparison, none of Taylor Swifts songs had been played on the station.

There have been previous examples of songs appearing on the poll without ever being played, including Alanis Morissette, Green Day, U2 and the Foo Fighters. me over (featuring Safia) in fifth spot.

On the morning of the countdown, there was a drum roll and Triple J's Lewi McKirdy announced that Taylor Swift will not be appearing in this year’s list ‘for a whole range of reasons’.

An article with a comprehensive explanation for the decision was put on the Triple J website, but very few are privy to this information as the website crashed just a minute after it was posted.

Daily Mail Australia viewed the post which is titled 'eight hilarious but totally true reasons you didn't hear Taylor Swift in the Hottest 100'. 

The humorous article, laden with sarcasm, has copied the format of the website 'Buzzfeed' which lead the #Tay4Hottest100 campaign.

'Their #Tay4Hottest100 campaign bought Taylor a one-way ticket to bansville,' a Triple J author wrote.

Although they did wish to clarify, 'triple j doesn't have beef with Taylor Swift.'

'She's smart, she's cool and she has excellent taste in BFFs,' in reference to Swift's friendship with Lorde, who made numerous appearances in last year's Hottest 100 countdown. 

 Before the music countdown began, there was a drum roll and Triple J's Lewi McKirdy announced that Taylor Swift will not be appearing in this year’s list ‘for a whole range of reasons’

The Triple J author explains that they took issue with the fact Buzzfeed, an international media company worth $850 million and the allegedly the leading source of cat GIFs, was 'throwing their weight around to influence a publicly voted music poll'.

'It's not legit for other media to try and troll the poll,' Triple J wrote.

Triple J has strict rules which promise to 'remove artists from the list who have benefited from competitions or commercial campaigns that incentivise fans to vote for them'.

The article then points out the number of 'trolls' who voted for Taylor Swift to 'prod the hipsters for lulz', meaning they did not vote for the young muso because of a genuine interest in the countdown.

'Do we really want to be talking about this every year?' Triple J asked. 

They argue that if the Taylor Swift campaign was successful it would have a long-term impact on their music poll, with other campaigns inevitably set to follow in future years, supporting people like 'Rebecca Black, Crazy Frog and Paris Hilton'.

That would be a 'sh***y, sh***y tragedy.' 

KFC were also pointed out as being partially responsible for their decision after the fast food chain launched a campaign endorsing the pop icon in the lead up to the annual Australia Day countdown.

'Not every KFC idea is a good one,' pointed out Triple J in their 'Triple J Feed' post.  

The fast food giant jumped on the frenzied social media attempt to include the starlet in the Triple J Hottest 100, a campaign which has sparked both waves of support and fury from polarised music lovers.

The fast food chain offered a $19.89 voucher, in reference to the pop star's latest album 1989, to customers who posted their favourite Swift song- a move which may breach the countdown's strict policy of banning artists who give their fans incentives to vote.  

'"We'd prefer that people vote for the love of music, not the love of cholesterol",' Triple J responded on Australian Day, hitting out at the fast food chain after they tried to cash in on the Hottest 100 hype. 

An article with a comprehensive explanation for the decision was put on the Triple J website, but very few are privy to this information as the website crashed just a minute after it was posted 

Triple J confirmed that the voucher was in direct violation of the Triple J Hottest 100 voting rules, which clearly state that the station will 'remove artists from the list who have benefited from competitions or commercial campaigns that incentivise fans to vote for them'. 

Following the announcment, Social Media was bombarded with posts – some celebrating the decision, others devastated by Swift’s exclusion.

‘Dear @triplej why do you hate joy and puppies and kittens and bubbles and good things YOU MONSTERS,’ wrote Aya Reina.

‘Is it too cliche to tell @taylorswift13 fans to shake it off?’ said Chris Matthews-Darby

‘Now the people who were waiting for Taylor Swift, but have never listened to @triplej can go away now,’ said Ren.

Almost in direct response, Dylan Malloch posted ‘So, @triplej just ensured I won't be listening to any of the #hottest100 this year by not including #taylorswift.’   

Harsh: In retaliation, extreme alternative music fans with a penchant for violent threats then took to social media to intimidate Taylor supporters

Earlier on Tuesday, an unofficial poll shed some  insight into who might take home the coveted Triple J Hottest 100 crown, with Swift making the cut despite the controversy.

Taylor Swift was given a number 75 ranking on the Social Hottest 100 which has proved an inaccurate prediction, many hipsters nationwide may well hurl into fits of rage come Australia Day when the ABC radio station's annual alternative music poll hits the airwaves.

Nasty: 'I hope you die a slow, painful death,' one wrote to a voter, while another compared a fan to ISIS
