Hitting shelves: Yuzu juice will go on sale as part of Waitrose Cooks' ingredients range

Juice from a Japanese citrus fruit hailed as the next superfood because of its level of vitamin C is to go on sale in UK supermarkets.

It tastes like a cross between a lemon, 
mandarin and grapefruit and is finally being accepted into Western 
cuisine, where it is being used to flavour everything from beer and 
chewing gum to vinegar and cocktails.

Until now, the yuzu could only be found in the UK on restaurant menus and in specialist Asian food shops.

Even celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has struggled to get hold of it in the past, substituting it with grapefruit in his recipe for home-made yuzu mayo when he can't get the real thing to drizzle over grilled scallops.

But it will now appear on Waitrose shelves this weekend in the form of a Waitrose Cooks' Ingredients juice, selling for £4.59 for a 60ml bottle.

The yuzu has been used in Asian cooking for centuries, and Waitrose said demand for the fruit had grown as customers became more familiar with Japanese cuisine.

Other fans of the fruit include chef 
Nigel Slater, who makes a yuzu dressing for his crab and apple slaw, and 
nationwide chain Yo! Sushi, who is adding a dish that includes a salsa 
made of yuzu to its menu later this month.

Yo! Sushi said the fruit was 'a new flavour for the British palate'.

Superfruit: The Japanese yuzu is packed full of vitamin C

Executive
chef Mike Lewis said: 'Yuzu looks like a tangerine and tastes similar 
to a floral lime. It has three times more vitamin C than a lemon, which 
makes our dish super-healthy.'

Waitrose development chef James Bennington said: 'This is a potent juice, which is both citrusy and aromatic.

'Theres no Western equivalent - its a complex flavour with hints of mandarin, lemon and grapefruit. Yuzu is so flexible it can be used in savoury dishes, matching particularly well with fish, as well as cocktails and desserts.'

The juice can be also be used in marinades, salad dressings and sauces or as an addition to lemonade and mayonnaise.
