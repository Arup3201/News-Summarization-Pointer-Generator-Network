The flu season only kicked off in late December but there are already signs that the UK could be heading for an epidemic, with the number affected at its highest level for three years.

Last week, doctors reported a 'significant rise' in the number of hospital admissions, while Flusurvey, a European-wide monitoring system, says reported cases across all age groups has doubled in seven days - a much bigger leap compared with the same time last year.

With the flu season not set to peak for six weeks, many more people could be affected, so what's going on?

Around 20 per cent of samples taken from people with flu and tested by Public Health England have been found to be 'drifted' strains - or mutations - of H3N2

The problem is being blamed on the nature of this particular flu virus and the fact it has mutated.

The jab is designed to prevent the most widespread flu virus, known as H3N2. However, the mutations of the virus appear resistant to it.

In hospitals, around 20 per cent of samples taken from people with flu and tested by Public Health England have been found to be 'drifted' strains - or mutations - of H3N2.

This rate of mutation is ten times higher than normal. Meanwhile, the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention have announced that half of their samples are mutations.

AM I SAFE IF I'VE HAD THE JAB?

Every year the flu jab is different, protecting against the three flu types scientists have identified as being those likely to cause the most problems in the flu season.

The scientists gather each February at the HQ of the World Health Organisation in Geneva and base their decision on what happened the previous winter in the southern hemisphere (when it was our summer); this gives an early indication of which flu viruses are likely to affect us next. The vaccines are developed and given in October or November, before the flu season starts in the northern hemisphere.

This year, scientists pinpointed one strain as the major cause of flu in 2015 - Influenza A type H3N2.

Although H3N2 is not as virulent as some other strains, it mutates very easily, so the vaccine is not as protective against it.

'Around 20 per cent of patients are infected with mutated strains which is higher than we expect - this figure would usually be around 2 per cent,' says John Oxford, professor of virology at Barts and the School of Medicine and Dentistry at Queen Mary University of London.

'For some reason, this year's strain mutates quickly - it's impossible to say why this virus behaves differently.'

IS THIS 'MUTANT' FLU MORE RISKY?

The short answer is no. 'It won't make any difference to healthy adults who have strong immune systems - and there's no reason to believe a mutated form of H3N2 will give you a worse dose of flu,' explains Professor Oxford.

Nor are the new mutations more infectious. However, importantly, vulnerable people who've had the flu jab may not be as well protected and may develop flu symptoms.

People considered at risk of flu are offered a free jab every year.

They include: the over-65s; pregnant women; patients with certain medical conditions including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (including emphysema) and diabetes; those living in a care home; carers and healthcare workers.

Children aged two to four are also offered vaccination (as a nasal spray).

Last week, Dr Ben Marshall, a specialist in respiratory medicine at Southampton General Hospital, said they had admitted many more patients in the at-risk groups who should have been protected by their annual flu jab.

'We have seen the number of patients, mainly those with respiratory conditions such as asthma or COPD, being admitted as emergencies increase from 25-30 a day to more than 50.'

Around half have the H3N2 virus. 'The numbers have been far higher and there is no sign of that letting up any time soon.'

WHO IS MOST LIKELY TO GET IT?

This year's 'top' flu bug is more likely to a problem for older people and very young children, not because they are more likely to be infected but because their symptoms would be worse.

'Older people tend to have lowered immunity and other health issues, such as COPD or diabetes, which may make them more vulnerable to serious complications,' explains Professor Oxford.

Flu can lead to pneumonia, which can be deadly.

'Small children are at a mechanical disadvantage because they have smaller airways, so inflammation can have a more serious effect and lead to dangerous breathing difficulties,' he adds.

IS FLU CAUSING THE A&E CRISIS?

While Dr Marshall says the number of patients admitted with respiratory illnesses as an emergency has doubled, Professor Oxford says there is no evidence the mutant H3N2 viruses have been behind overcrowding in crisis-hit A&E departments.

Instead, other respiratory infections and the norovirus have been mainly responsible. Figures from Public Health England revealed the winter norovirus season started early when there were 18 outbreaks of norovirus in hospitals across England in October - 17 led to ward closures.

Three wards at Southampton General Hospital closed to new admissions due to outbreaks of diarrhoea and vomiting.

Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriology at the University of Aberdeen, explains: 'Norovirus does happen all year round but the main season does seem to have started off a bit earlier this year.

'An earlier start will be having an impact.'

Wearing a face mask, a popular preventative measure in the Far East, won't make a huge difference to whether you catch the virus, says Professor Oxford. 'These masks can stop transmission via large droplets, but the virus can still go straight through in an aerosol form, i.e. as a mist of tiny liquid particles. Masks should not be considered an alternative to having the jab.' There's no hard evidence that vitamin C can boost your immune system, although a healthy diet with plenty of fruit and vegetables is good for general health.

'Wash your hands thoroughly, particularly before eating, and use an anti-viral gel regularly and often,' says Professor Oxford.

For those worried about loved ones in care homes, the key is good hygiene practices, says Professor Oxford. 'And people should not visit a care home if they suspect they have the flu.'

IS THE FLU JAB A WASTE OF TIME?

No, says Professor Oxford, who points out that it protects against two other kinds of flu strains as well as H3N2. 'It also protects against the serious H1N1 strain (swine flu) which caused the pandemic in 2009, and B/Massachusetts/2, a strain which was active in 2012.'

Also, while he can't say for sure, he believes that even mutated versions of H3N2 will be weakened by the antibodies in the jab.

'It may mean people get a less serious version of the flu virus with milder symptoms. I would be very surprised if the jab offered no protection at all.'

Dr Richard Pebody, head of seasonal flu surveillance at Public Health England, adds: 'Existing vaccine is likely to still provide some protection and getting vaccinated remains the best way to protect yourself from flu.'

Clare Wenham, research fellow in Public Health Engagement at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who runs Flusurvey in the UK, says that no one should be put off having a jab because H3N2 mutations have been found.

'We want to encourage all vulnerable people to have the vaccine if they haven't already done so.'

The best time is the autumn before the season starts, but it is possible to have the jab later, as long as stocks are left. Ask your GP. If you are not eligible for a free jab, you can pay for one at many pharmacists.

WHAT ABOUT CHILDREN?

From September 2013, flu vaccinations were added to the childhood immunisation schedule and children aged two, three and four are now automatically offered vaccination, although many are still to take it up.

Older children with asthma may be eligible for a free jab - talk to your GP or practice nurse. Uptake among children is around 40 per cent.

'Not only is it important for the child's protection, but children are known to be virus spreaders and can easily transmit infection to grand-parents and other vulnerable family members,' says Professor Oxford.
