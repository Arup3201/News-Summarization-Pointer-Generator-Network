Roger Federer set up a blockbuster rematch with world number one Novak Djokovic by beating Milos Raonic to reach the final of the BNP Paribas Open.

Following Djokovic's comprehensive 6-2 6-3 victory over British No 1 Andy Murray, Federer reached his 40th ATP World Tour Masters 1000 final with a 7-5 6-4 defeat of Canadian sixth seed Raonic at Indian Wells.

Sunday's showdown will be a 38th meeting between reigning champion Djokovic and world number two Federer, who is on a 19-set winning streak.

'I think it's very exciting for both of us, and also for fans, to see a rematch of the great final from last year,' Federer, who lost to the Serbian in three sets in the Californian desert back in 2014, told bnpparibasopen.com.

'I'm looking forward to it, and I hope I can keep up my good play.'

Federer earned a break point in the fifth game but Raonic saved it with an ace before holding. The Swiss soon broke for a 6-5 lead and wrapped up the set.

The 33-year-old opened the second set with a break to consolidate his lead and went on to endure nine aces before saving a break point to claim victory inside 86 minutes.

'I felt good. I felt energetic. I felt like I had the right attitude put forward, and I was going to give it my all,' Raonic told the ATP World Tour website.

'I thought a few points here and there made a difference. I tried to put everything out there that I could, and the outcome was as is.'

Earlier on Saturday, Djokovic ended world number four Murray's fine run to a first Masters 1000 semi-final in two years by extending his head-to-head advantage between the pair to 17-8 with a sixth successive win.

The Scot elected to receive serve after winning the toss but stumbled as Djokovic quickly reached 4-1 before ruthlessly clinching all three of his break points in the set to prevail. 

The current Wimbledon champion broke Murray again in the second game of the second set and saved two break points to go to 4-1 and 5-2. Then, after his opponent slipped from 30-0 up to 40-30 down, Djokovic gladly served the match out.

Murray said: 'The frustrating thing is obviously getting off to a bad start in both sets.

'Novak didn't give me any free points at the beginning of either set and I made a few too many errors early on.

'At the end of both sets, I started to play a bit better and made it tougher and was able to push him a bit, but not enough at the beginning of the sets to make it challenging enough for him.'

Djokovic told Sky Sports 3: 'I tried to start with the right intensity, I got a crucial break at the start.

'Andy made a lot of unforced errors, his first-serve percentage was low. I'm sure he knows I'm returning well, I know he's returning well, so that puts added pressure on our serving.'

The women's final precedes the men's showdown on Sunday and sees 2010 champion Jelena Jankovic tackle Romania's Simona Halep, who received a pass into the final thanks to Serena Williams' withdrawal through injury.
