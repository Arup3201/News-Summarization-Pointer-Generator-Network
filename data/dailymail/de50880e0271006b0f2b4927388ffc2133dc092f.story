A unique home in Oregon is guaranteed to appeal to kids of all ages, as it has a fully rideable railroad, complete with bridges, tunnels and a trainyard, that fully encircles the 19-acre estate.

The astonishing property, described as a 'Railway Resort', is also on sale. And at just $3.5 million, this feat of model engineering might well be worth it.

Inside the house in Sherwood, just south of Portland, Oregon, there's another model railway at a much smaller scale.

There's a station, a miniature railyard and store that all service the train network, perfect for entertaining grandchildren - or grandparents.

The Zillow listing for the property describes it as a 'legendary Property - globally acclaimed and masterfully engineered... regarded as the finest railroad of its kind.'

The home, built in Cape Cod style, was first built in 1930, but the actual house is not the first thing that comes to mind with this railway resort.
