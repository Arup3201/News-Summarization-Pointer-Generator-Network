The horrific details surrounding the death of a three-year-old boy who was allegedly abused and killed by his mother and her boyfriend before his body was set alight have been revealed in court.

Breanna Arnold, 21, was reportedly 'shooting dope' with her 30-year-old boyfriend, Zachary Barnes, and their 16-year-old friend at her trailer home in Bluffton,  Indiana, last Friday night.

As the trio got high, they allegedly decided to 'put dope' in the bottles of Arnold's son, Owen Collins, and his six-year-old brother, who has not been named, so they could 'watch them have fun'.

The following morning, Owen was found dead by his mother.

Case: The horrific details surrounding the death of a three-year-old boy who was allegedly abused and killed by his mother, Breanna Arnold (right), and her boyfriend, Zachary Barnes (left) have been revealed in court

Allegations: Arnold (pictured being led to court on Tuesday), 21, was reportedly 'shooting dope' with 30-year-old Barnes and their 16-year-old unidentified friend at her trailer home in Bluffton, Indiana, last Friday night

Victim: As the trio got high, they allegedly decided to 'put dope' in the bottles of Arnold's son, Owen Collins (pictured), so they could 'watch him have fun'.The following morning, Owen was found dead by his mother

After Arnold alerted Barnes to her son's condition, he suggested they dispose of the child's body, the court heard. The pair then apparently wrapped Owen in a plastic bag and put him in a  drawer.

On Sunday morning, Barnes and the teenage friend allegedly removed the youngster's corpse from the drawer, before placing it in a cardboard box and hitching a ride with a woman to Marion.

While en route, they asked the woman to stop at a wooded area in Wells County, the court heard.

Once there, they allegedly walked away from the car, before Barnes doused the box with nail polish remover and set it alight. They then got back into the woman's vehicle and resumed their journey.

When Barnes and the teenager - who had apparently been living with the couple for several months and acted as their babysitter - arrived in Marion, Barnes told his brother Owen was missing.

In following hours,  Wells County Sheriff’s Department launched a manhunt for the boy, during which they interviewed Arnold and searched hers and Barnes's house in Normandy Drive.

They eventually tracked down Barnes, the teenager and the woman. When told of the situation by officers, the woman led them to the wooded area that her passengers had stopped off at.

There, police discovered Owen's badly-burned body at around 8pm on Sunday, the court heard. 

Now, Arnold and Barnes have been arrested and charged with preliminary felony counts of neglect of a dependent resulting in death.

Barnes is also charged with abuse of a corpse, WANE.com reported.

 Meanwhile, the unidentified teenager is facing their own felony count of abuse of a corpse.

During the hearing in Bluffton on Tuesday, the court heard that Arnold discovered her son's dead body in the trailer's back bedroom, before running to her boyfriend saying, 'my baby'. 

Sickeningly, while the couple were discussing what to do with Owen's corpse, there was even discussion about 'chopping him up and throwing him in the river', the teenager later told police. 

During a separate interview with officers, Barnes reportedly admitted to disposing of Owen's body out of fear, adding that he and Arnold would put 'dope in [the children’s] bottles and watch them have fun.'

Police also found meth-making materials in the trailer, it is reported.

Shocked: Following Tuesday's hearing, resident Teasha Stephen (pictured) said the 'disgraceful' details of the case had left her 'wanting to throw up'. She added: 'We hope these people get what they deserve - if not more'

A notification from Indiana State Police indicating that known hazardous chemicals had been removed from the premises was seen pinned to the couple's front door on Tuesday, according to WISHTV.com.

Following Tuesday's hearing, resident Teasha Stephen said the 'disgraceful' details of the case had left her 'wanting to throw up'. She added: 'We hope these people get what they deserve - if not more.'

The cause of Owen's death is yet to be confirmed. Toxicology tests are currently underway.

An investigation is ongoing.
