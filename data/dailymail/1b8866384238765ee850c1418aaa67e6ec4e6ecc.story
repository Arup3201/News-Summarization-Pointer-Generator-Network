A fifth of British office workers are so tied they have dozed off at their desks, a new study has revealed.

The poll of sleepy staff found that a third of those quizzed had taken a nap at work due to an afternoon energy slump, with one in five actually falling asleep at their desks.

Around one in five, or 22 per cent of the 2,000 UK office staff polled, have snoozed for between ten minutes and an hour - with most people napping for 47 minutes and Wednesday being the day these workers are most likely to nod off in the office.

The research was carried out by energy drink Lucozade Revive, who noted that a sneaky one in ten admitted to falling asleep in a meeting room or an office bathroom.

However, 18 per cent had not even made it that far and had simply crashed out at their desks.

And it appears workers’ happy moods helps colleagues stay awake, with 52 per cent of those surveyed saying that ‘working with cheerful colleagues’ helps them fight fatigue in the office, and more than a third (38 per cent) of those who nap at work confessing they do so because they hate their job.

When it comes to sleeping on the job it 
is women who are the biggest culprits, with 70 per cent saying they 
experience an afternoon slump at least once a week, compared to just 58 
per cent of men.

Almost two thirds (63 per cent) of media and advertising workers blame a ‘heavy lunch’ for their afternoon fatigue, and a third (33 per cent) blame boozing the night before as the reason why they fall asleep at work.

An overwhelming 91 per cent of people working in accountancy and financial services said they experience an afternoon lull.

Regular afternoon dips in energy equate to an average of 24 unproductive days a year for each UK office worker - equating to almost a tenth of the average worker’s annual salary.

Adam Harris, an office worker from Portsmouth, Hampshire, has felt so tired that he found himself nodding off at work.

The 28-year-old father of one said: 'With a young baby I can get extremely tired after lunch, particularly midweek.

'I have sneaked off to a corner in the staff room for a quick power nap, but once I actually nodded off at my desk.'

Oliver Gray, an expert in employee wellbeing and energy, said: 'This research shows that struggling to stay awake at work is becoming part of modern life.

'People need to manage their energy better and think about their diet, physical activity and lifestyle.

'Instead of unhealthy snack like crisps, cake and chocolate, they should look for products containing energy releasing B vitamins because they help unlock and release the energy in the food you eat.'
