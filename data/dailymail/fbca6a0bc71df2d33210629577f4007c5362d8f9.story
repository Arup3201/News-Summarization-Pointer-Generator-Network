At six weeks of age, little Nathan, Mal and their sister who is yet to be named, resemble three kittens purring and napping for the majority of the day.

But by the end of the year, Ben Britton, 37, expects his current African lion roommates to weigh up to 40 kilograms each and no longer fit on his couch.

As the director of Wild Animal Encounters in Western Sydney, Mr Britton has taken on the role of the lions' mother from the day they were born, after their natural mother rejected them.

'They're only just starting to find their feet,' Mr Britton told Daily Mail Australia.

Ben Britton, 37, the director of Wild Animal Encounters in Western Sydney, is raising three African lion cubs in his lounge room after their mother rejected them after birth

'They're sleeping around 20-22 hours a day at the moment so they're not very active, they only have short bursts of energy when they're fed which is about four times a day, and then they crash about half an hour after that.'

Wild lion numbers are falling at a significant rate across the world, dropping to 26,000 from over half a million in only 100 years.

In an effort to promote the magnificent animal's conservation the company, which also spends a quarter of each year working in Botswana, hopes the three cubs become their fury ambassadors and encourage Australians to help in their preservation.

Teaming up with National Geographic, Mr Britton is documenting his relationship with the three cubs as they grow up.

At only six-weeks-old, weighing no more than six kilograms each and growing at least a kilogram every day, Ben has personally bottle fed them from one-day-old

Mr Britton said the cubs spend up to 22 hours a day sleeping and have short bursts of energy lasting for only half an hour around their meal times before they crash

'We've just introduced meat into their diet, so they get one meat feed a day and they get extra excited around that time, but by the time the evening news is on they've crashed out on the lounge.

'Yeah - they have already worked out how to get on the lounge. They just take a little run and jump.'

But as their weight grows by one kilogram a week, it won't be long before the big cats can no longer find a space on the couch.

Before their second birthdays, the two boys - named in memory of Mr Britton's best friend Nathan and his favourite sports player Mal Meninga - will weigh over 150 kilograms each. In their prime, at about four-years-old, each male could potentially weigh over 200 kilograms while their sister will reach about 160 kilograms.

Despite her smaller frame Mr Britton says the female cub, who will be named through an online competition later in the year, is developing a strong personality already.

The 37-year-old said the female 'rules the roost' and bosses her brother around. He described the two male cubs as 'sooks' who preferred to cuddle up to him

'Lions are a social cat and when you are involved with them for this long you become part of the pride, so they do remember you and want to interact with you and they still want to have that relationship when they are older,' Mr Britton said

'The girl is the boss, she definitely rules the roost, which doesn't surprise me,' he said.

'So she bosses her brothers around and even though she's the smallest, she's the most confident – you often find that with lions.

'The boys are a bit sooky really, they like their cuddles and to sit with you a bit more which is often the case with male lions even when they're bigger.'

'The great things about lions is they're a social cat and when you are involved with them for this long you become part of the pride, so they do remember you and want to interact with you and they still want to have that relationship when they are older. That’s a special thing you don't get with other cat species.'

Even with them starting to find the use of their teeth and claws on household furniture, Mr Britton, whose home on site the zoo has housed and array of animals from kangaroos and wombats to monkeys and crocodiles, says the lions are some of his most welcome house guests.

'The cats sleep so much that it means they're pretty good whereas when you've got a joey it needs to be in a pouch and you have to carry it around with you and clean up the pouch regularly.'

The company says their animals' 'lives extend beyond the boundaries of their enclosure' and that they often take them into new environments to enrich their lives

'Monkeys also want to be with you the whole time and cling to you all day, whereas lioness' would just have the cubs in her den and then go off and do her thing, so compared to the other animals we've had, the lions are the easiest ones by far.' 

Bringing the animals out of their enclosures and into new environments, including his home, is a regularly practiced thing at the Wild Animal Encounters park.

'Animals have got so much going on in the wild – food, shelter, predators, prey and so on - when they come into captivity we supply and delete a lot of that and the mental side in captivity is hard to match, so we try to enrich their lives as much as we can which includes investigating new areas,' Mr Britton said.

'The big cats for instance get to walk a kilometre a week outrside their enclosure. They get to investigate the frog ponds and chase skinks in the garden. Their lives extend beyond the boundaries of their enclosure.'
