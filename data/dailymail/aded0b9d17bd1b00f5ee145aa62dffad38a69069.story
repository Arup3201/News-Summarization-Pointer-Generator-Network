Predatory: Andrew Jackson, who stalked schoolgirls aged 13 and 14 around Bridlington

A sex attacker who stalks schoolgirls has been spared jail after a judge said he sympathised with his frustration that he had never had a ‘full sexual relationship’.

Andrew Jackson, 48, was told that he deserved a prison sentence but, as he has Asperger’s syndrome, sending him to jail would be ‘utterly cruel’.

Jackson is known to follow young girls on his moped and cause them distress, often by striking up sexual conversations with them.

Passing sentence at Hull Crown Court, Judge Jeremy Richardson QC, told him:  ‘You have never had a full  sexual relationship – it must be very frustrating.

‘I wish to make it plain you deserve to be sent to prison. But you are very much to be pitied.

‘I have a public duty, but it would be quite wrong to impose a cruel punishment.

‘Quite frankly you could not cope in prison. I have no doubt your life would be a misery.’

Jackson, who lives with his  parents in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, admitted sexual assault on a 21-year-old woman in April last year.

She was sitting on a park bench when she was molested by Jackson, the court heard.

A friend heard her cries of ‘help, help’ and dragged him  off her.

Jackson was given a two-year supervised community order designed to change his behaviour and was ordered to sign the sex offender register.

The judge also imposed a ten-year sexual offences prevention order, to limit his contact with girls under 16.

Judge Richardson said justice demanded he took a ‘thoroughly exceptional course’ and show that the courts were ‘not without compassion’ by ignoring sentencing guidelines and sparing Jackson the ordeal of prison.

He said: ‘Young girls have to be protected in your area.

‘You have to learn to control yourself. I regard sexual offences as a very serious crime.

‘Usually the men involved deserve to be sent to prison.

‘It would not be right here. It would be bordering on cruelty. However, if you harass any more girls you will end up in jail.’

The judge said Jackson had a number of ‘eccentric and obsessional characteristics’.

The court heard that, before the sex attack, police officers had already spoken to Jackson on two occasions about stalking children in playgrounds and wooded areas. 

Took pity: Judge Jeremy Richardson QC allowed Jackson to walk free from Hull Crown Court, saying it would be 'utterly cruel' to imprison him

He showed a girl of 13 his private parts and in a separate incident had a sexual conversation with two girls of 14.

These incidents are understood to be an example of a  pattern of behaviour.

Prosecutor Martin Sharpe said police in the seaside town were so concerned about the threat he posed that they wanted a legal order banning him from playgrounds.

‘There are a number of times he has followed young children,’ he said.

‘He has regularly been noted. He follows them and causes them distress.’

Patrick Palmer, defending, said Jackson had a low IQ, did not work and although his condition could not be cured it could be managed on a day-to-day basis.

The prevention order bans Jackson from living or working with girls under 16 as well as having any association with a girl, unless a responsible adult is aware of his offending history.

But Claude Knights, of the charity Kidscape, questioned whether the judge had been too compassionate, adding: ‘This is a very disturbing case.

‘We have to ask whether the courts have hit the right balance in their attempt to show compassion by ignoring sentencing guidelines.

‘It must not be forgotten that the safety of children and young people is paramount.’
