When David Beckham signed for LA Galaxy in 2007, the whole team was invited to a welcome party thrown by Will Smith and Tom Cruise.

Stars grow on trees in Los Angeles and we were suddenly mingling with people like LeBron James at this glitzy event held for the Beckhams.

At the time Galaxy wasn’t ready for a star like him to play for the club, but a lot has changed over the past few years.

Signing Steven Gerrard is a 'dream scenario' for LA Galaxy, according to Kyle Martino

To sign Steven Gerrard is the dream scenario, one of the players Galaxy had on their wishlist when Landon Donovan announced that he would be retiring.

It is a big, bold statement by MLS and particularly a team with LA Galaxy’s ambitions.

Since Gerrard made the decision to move to LA he has had a number of telephone conversations with the president Chris Klein and the coach Bruce Arena. From what I hear they were very impressed by him.

Steven is a leader, an iconic figure and to acquire a player of this quality and pedigree at this stage of his career is a pretty big deal for Galaxy.

Gerrard has signed an initial 18-month contract with Galaxy, but Martino would like to see him stay even longer

His initial contract is for 18 months, but I would love to see him stay out here a bit longer because then he could play in the derby against the new franchise LAFC.

The Merseyside derby against Everton is an iconic fixture that Gerrard has starred in over the years, and it would be something special to see him play for Galaxy against a rival team from the same city when they are up and running in 2017.

In a few months’ time there is also a big lifestyle change coming for him and all the boys in the locker room will be lobbying him to live in their part of the city.

I think Robbie Keane lives in downtown LA, you have the guys who live in Hollywood, Beverley Hills and those who choose to live by the ocean. I was talking to David the other day and we had a laugh because he said maybe Steven should just rent out his house!

Keane has been a big hit since his move to Galaxy in 2011

He can live wherever he wants untroubled and stress free, taking his kids down to the ocean in the afternoons or to the park. I don’t think he will get the same attention with the paparazzi as Beckham.

In many ways I felt for David because I really liked him and I saw a guy who just wanted to be normal and to play his football.

He was humble and remains a good friend.

There is a huge difference in the salaries of the players, but the Galaxy players will respect Gerrard for his achievements in the game and his status, They will play practical jokes just like any other.

At Galaxy, when Beckham and I were trying to get to the medical room first he taped up my locker while I was having treatment because I had got there first.

I retaliated by putting super glue on the soles of his flip flops so that when he put his feet into them he would not be able to move. The poor guy nearly fell on the floor when he tried to walk.

That is normal, usual stuff in any locker room and Gerrard will be made to feel part of it. He will make friends for life there.

Yes the guy next to him could be earning $30,000 a year and he will be earning maybe $5m, but that same player will still invite him round to a BBQ with the rest of the players later that day.

When Becks was with us he told me that at one of his clubs he didn't get invited to a team-mate’s house once. Galaxy is a different way of life and everybody mixes socially.

Galaxy sold plenty of 'Beckham' shirts during his time at the club

The temperature is around 70-75 every day as well and he will be able to walk down the street in relative anonymity.

People travel from all over to be in our backyard and Gerrard is going to live in one of the greatest cities in the world.

The standard of Major League Soccer is better than the Europeans like to portray it, too. Gerrard will help raise the profile of it.

There will be adaptations, such as the long distance travelling for games. That really did shock Beckham and Abel Xavier, the former Everton defender, when they signed for Galaxy.

Kyle Martino insists Gerrard will love his time in LA

Some of the pitches are artificial too and Gerrard will have to get used to playing on them. I don’t think Beckham liked them.

The Galaxy fans will love his commitment, passion and desire. It was very noticeable that he has spoken of winning trophies and that is good because Galaxy have won three titles in the last four years.

They get around 28,000 at the StubHub Center and they are a passionate group of fans. At this stage of his career it is the perfect fit.
