It would be heartening to think that friends, family and workmates are truthful all the time.

Human nature, sadly, is not like that – but you can boost the chance of straight answers by asking questions in the morning.

A study found that it is easier for people to lie in the afternoon as the self-control which normally stops them cheating breaks down as they get tired.

A study by Harvard University found that men and women find it easier fib and deceive in the afternoon when they are tired, than in the morning

Researchers added that the more 
fundamentally honest someone is, the more likely they are to succumb to 
the ‘morning morality effect’.

They said: ‘Our findings suggest that the mere time of day can lead to a systematic failure of good people to act morally.’

Are you more likely to lie in the afternoon than the morning?

The conclusion came from experiments at Harvard University in Massachusetts, US.

In
one, a group of young men and women were shown a pattern of dots on a 
computer and asked to say if there were more on the right or left of the
screen.

In some cases, it was hard to tell but in others the correct answer was clear.

The
volunteers were given cash for every round they played. However, the 
payments were not given for answering correctly. Instead, the 
participants were given ten times as much for choosing the right side of
the screen rather than the left, which encouraged fibbing.

Those
who played the game in the afternoon were more likely to say the dots 
were on the right when they were clearly on the left, reported the 
journal Psychological Science.

Are there benefits to lying? The U.S. researchers said that people who lie with ease on a regular basis are less affected by the stress and strains of everyday life

A
second experiment tested if respondents were more aware of ethics in 
the morning than in the afternoon. Men and women were given words with 
missing letters and asked to complete them.

Those
taking part in the morning were more likely to see  E_ _ _ C _ _  and _
_ RAL and think of the words ‘ethical’ and ‘moral’.

But those doing the test in the afternoon tended to form the words ‘effects’ and ‘coral.’

Two
further experiments  confirmed that people become more flexible with 
the truth as they day went on.

The study also showed that those who 
prided themselves on being honest were more susceptible to the effect.

Three experiments showed the more honest someone is, the more likely they are to lie when they are tired and their willpower wanes

It is thought that tiredness makes it harder for them to exercise the self-control needed to resist the temptation to cheat.

In
contrast, those who lie with ease have less self-control to begin with 
and so are less affected by the strains of everyday life.

The researchers said: ‘We found that people are vulnerable to a gradual depletion of self-regulatory processes as a result of unremarkable daily activities.

‘This depletion can, in turn, lead them to act in ethically questionable ways.

‘Unfortunately, it might be that the most honest people are most susceptible to the negative consequences associated with the morning mortality effect.

‘In other words, our findings suggest that the mere time of day can lead to a systematic failure of good people to act morally.’
