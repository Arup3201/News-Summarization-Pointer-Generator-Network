A mother-of-two killed herself by jumping from a multi-storey car park after suffering years of  crippling pain in her face believed to have been caused by toothache.

Janette Warburton, 58, was in agony and struggled to eat or sleep but her  problem was never fully diagnosed, an inquest heard today.

On March 29 this year she drove to Blackpool with her husband David to see a dentist because experts believed her pain was caused by a cracked filling.

In pain: Janette Warburton, 58, jumped off a car park after suffering crippling, undiagnosed, pain in her mouth and face for up to five years 

However, the inquest heard how Mrs Warburton then told her husband she felt too unwell to attend the appointment and so he went into the surgery to explain.

But while he was away she threw herself from the fifth storey of the town's Talbot Road car park.

Parking warden Craig Walker told her inquest how he saw the 58-year-old climbing a barrier and yelled 'come back' but she replied: 'I'm going' and jumped to her death.

After her death, her sister Carol Clements, 61, found she had researched how to kill herself online.

She said: 'The pain in her face first started around five years ago. She wasn't sure what it was but thought it was maybe because she'd had so many teeth removed'.

Mrs Clements said in December last year the pain became unbearable.

She said: 'Janette was in Tenerife and she bit down on something hard and it really set the pain off.

'This pain was worse than she'd ever felt before and she didn't sleep for weeks.

'She couldn't eat and she stopped going out because she couldn't cope with the pain.  

'Around that time, she started talking about suicide and we didn't know at the time but she'd been researching it on the internet.

'By the end, she was sleeping just an hour each night and she said she felt like her body was shutting down. 

'Janette was loved by everyone and her two children were devoted to her.

Couple: Mrs Warburton told her husband David (pictured together) to run in to the dentist to cancel an appointment before jumping to her death. Mr Warburton says his wife was failed

Much loved: Mrs Warburton with her first grandchild Sawyer. She herself had two children

'Her friends were just as upset as myself and my three children. There is a huge hole in my life'. 

Her husband believes his wife had not received the help she needed, and said her condition meant she should not have been discharged from Royal Preston Hospital ten days before her death. 

Psychiatrist Gillian Strachan said Mrs Warburton had received visits from the Lancashire Care Trust's crisis team, amid concerns about her mental health.

But she cancelled the visits following her discharge from hospital having resisted seeing a psychologist.

Dr Strachan said that while Mrs Warburton had been depressed she had denied having any intention of suicide.

But two notes written by Mrs Warburton were found at her home, including one talking about not wanting to live any more.

Blackpool and Fylde coroner, Alan Wilson, accepted that Mrs Warburton had intended to take her own life and the post-mortem conclusion that she had died from multiple injuries following a fall.

He said there was no evidence of any 'gross failing' in her care and that she had not met criteria to be sectioned.

Her daughter Shelley Jacobs, who lives in Leicestershire and did not attend the hearing, said afterwards: 'Mum was vibrant, with a real sense of humour. She loved to travel and make cocktails.

'It's tragic that my seven-month old son Sawyer, her first grandchild, will not know his nana'.
