In her blue polka dot dress and with  a radiant smile on her face, the Duchess of Cambridge appeared enviably poised as she stood outside the Lindo Wing, just hours after giving birth.

And while most new mothers could be forgiven for exiting the ward with their hair scraped into a ponytail, the Duchess' famously long locks were as lustrous as ever.

But while the Kate Effect on fashion sales is well documented, it's her hair that most of us really want, according to a new survey.

Perfect: She might have been exhausted but Kate's hair was lovely as ever as Prince George made his debut

Popular: The Duchess' flowing locks have made her an inspiration for almost half the female population

The research, which was conducted by London salon Vixen & Blush, found that 78 per cent of women would rather have lustrous locks like Kate than a slimmer figure.

79 per cent of the women polled also said that they envied the glossy manes of celebrities such as Kim Sears and Nicole Scherzinger, with 25 per cent describing Sears as their hair idol and 16 per cent saying they would love to have the locks of the X-Factor judge.

But with 42 per cent of the vote, the Duchess of Cambridge proved the most popular hair inspiration of them all, while Megan Fox scraped into joint third place with 16 per cent of the vote.

Of those who had used hair extensions to copy the Duchess' long locks, 93 per cent reported that wearing extensions boosted their self-esteem - despite the high price of the hair, which costs upwards of £400 to buy.

Envied: Kim Sears and Nicole Scherzinger both have beautiful hair - and British women agree

Sarah McKenna, owner of Vixen & Blush, said: 'Many of our clients seek to 
achieve healthy-looking long hair when using hair extensions. 

'We are 
seeing a move towards clients wanting to subtly enhance their hair for 
more natural results with extensions.

'They want to emulate celebrities
like the Duchess of Cambridge and Kim Sears, whose hair is the embodiment of health.'
