The date is August 2, 1914, and in a Munich square a crowd reacts enthusiastically as a soldier reads out a proclamation that Germany has declared war.

Among them, cheering wildly and waving his hat, is the unmistakable figure of a 25-year-old Adolf Hitler.

This was the moment, the day that imperial Germany plunged into the First World War, at which he finally he found his purpose in life, he was to claim later.

Fake? Researchers claim Hitler's photographer Hoffmann manipulated this image of the moment Germany declared war on August 2, 1914, to feature the soon-to-be-dictator. It was later used for his election campaign

The photo first appeared in the pages 
of the Nazi propaganda publication German Illustrated Observer on March 
12, 1932, the year Hitler ran for president, with the breathless 
caption: ‘Adolf Hitler, the German patriot, is seen in the middle of the
 crowd. He stands with blazing eyes – Adolf Hitler.’

But now, 100 years after it was taken,
 there are claims the photo was faked and Hitler was never among the 
crowd in the Odeonsplatz square.

Research has failed to turn up the 
original negative of the picture. And intense scrutiny of newsreel 
footage has failed to spot Hitler among the throng.

Trimmed: Hitler preferred a longer moustache in his younger years, only trimming it to fit under a gas mask when he became a soldier, historians claim

Even the length of his moustache would
 also seem to indicate that the image of Hitler was inserted into the 
picture. In 1914 he preferred a longer moustache, only trimming it when 
he was a soldier so it would fit under a gas mask.

Further evidence that perhaps the 
whole thing was faked by him and Heinrich Hoffmann – later his personal 
photographer whose assistant Eva Braun would go on to become Hitler’s 
mistress – can be found in the pages of Hitler’s autobiography Mein 
Kampf, published in 1925.

He makes no mention of being in the 
Odeonsplatz on August 2 but does make reference to the following day, 
when he petitions the King of Bavaria to allow him, an Austrian, to 
fight for Germany.

Hoffmann was a master manipulator of 
photographs who did his patron’s bidding. Experts say it would have been
 easy for him to insert the photo of Hitler into the crowd scene.

In a report about the research, German
 newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung said: ‘Some historians are expressing 
suspicions that the photo was manipulated, although it is virtually 
impossible to prove also that it is a forgery.

‘Hitler said his desire to be a 
politician stemmed from that day in Munich. But the story is perhaps 
just a little bit too perfect.’

Researcher Elizabeth Angermair, who 
was asked to prove the provenance of the photo, said: ‘Its authenticity 
is based solely on the testimony of Hitler.

‘In the city archive of Munich there 
are several shots of the crowd in the Odeonsplatz, but the man with the 
famous moustache is not in any of them.’
