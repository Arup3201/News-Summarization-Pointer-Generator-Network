Stare closely at the pictures on this page. What do you think it took to create these beautiful images of Amy Winehouse, Mother Teresa, Princess Diana and Rihanna? An expensive camera, a precision lens, hours of trial and error from a skilled photographer?

Well, the answer is none of the above.

All of these extraordinarily detailed pictures are pencil drawings, created purely by hand — with no digital trickery — by British artist Kelvin Okafor, whose only tools are a set of pencils, a piece of paper and the occasional stick of charcoal (though most of the pictures don’t even require that). Yet no matter how closely one looks, there’s not a pencil line in sight.

The artist’s story is almost as 
sensational as the pictures he has been producing since he was a 
teenager who was too poor to leave his house to socialise. Instead of 
drinking and clubbing, Ofakor, now 27, stayed at home in Tottenham, 
North London, seeking solace in drawing. Now it looks as if he’s on his 
way to fame and fortune.

Today, an exhibition of his work 
opens at London’s Science Museum — and already some of his portraits are
 changing hands for £10,000 apiece. This week, a portrait he drew of 
King Hussein of Jordan is to be presented to the late monarch’s widow, 
Queen Noor.

Anyone can commission a portrait, 
though he will charge anything from £800 to £3,000 for his work. He says
 he prefers to work from photographs rather than real life — partly 
because of the length of time he spends on each picture.

So how does Okafor create these 
incredible works of art? ‘Before I start drawing, I spend a few hours — 
even a few days — analysing the face from every angle. I usually start 
with the eyes. From there, I make the whole shape of the face and I work
 in the detail.

‘I draw in sections. I’m right-handed
 so I work from left to right. After I’ve finished the left eye, I work 
the nostrils, then the left side of the cheek, then the lips. I always 
work in that order.

‘I work for four hours in one go, 
take a half-hour break, work another four to five hours, then have 
another half-hour break. After that I’ll work for as long as I can. 
Sometimes I might work ten to 15 hours in one day. It takes me on 
average 80 to 100 hours to do a portrait.’

He says the importance of hard work 
was impressed upon him, his brother and two sisters by their parents. 
His father, who now works in the oil industry, was originally a warden 
looking after a council estate; his mother stayed at home to bring up 
the children. For this is a story not just about an incredible craftsman
 but of the triumph of the human spirit, the value of faith and a 
strong, loving family. ‘Absolutely. My parents came to this country from
 Nigeria so that their children could have a better life. They instilled
 the message that hard work pays off.’

Education mattered, too. His parents,
 practising Catholics, fought for him to attend St Ignatius College, a 
prestigious Jesuit school in Enfield, several miles away from their home
 — whose ex-pupils include Alfred Hitchcock and Beatles producer Sir 
George Martin.

Okafor says: ‘Most teenagers 
experiment a lot with their life. They have their experiences.’ He means
 drink and drugs. ‘I didn’t have that. But, to be honest, I didn’t want 
it anyway. I was too busy trying to focus on my craft.’

Okafor, who had gained nine GCSEs, 
went on to study art at Middlesex University. It was here he found his 
true vocation. ‘When I draw, I’m doing something I love. I lose myself 
in my art. Time doesn’t matter to me.’ Incredibly, he was so absorbed in
 his work he was at first oblivious to the riots which were raging 
through his neighbourhood during summer 2011.

‘I was drawing at the time. My house 
is a minute away from where it was happening. I heard helicopters and I 
thought: “What’s going on?” Then I went outside and saw people running 
around, and I started getting phone calls asking: “Kelvin, are you OK? 
There’s a riot in Tottenham.” It was a big shock to me.’

Okafor believes he might never have 
become an artist had he not needed to look for a distraction. For his 
upbringing was far from privileged — not that he is the sort of person 
to complain about life.

He grew up in one of the country’s 
poorest areas, where he still lives with his family. As an 11-year-old, 
he returned home with his family from an extended holiday to find their 
house had been repossessed.

‘It was just before I started 
secondary school and my life changed completely. We were homeless — not 
living on the street but we didn’t have a house for ourselves for the 
next three years. We moved from place to place, from cousin to cousin.’

He lived in five different homes over
 the course of just a few years — before eventually moving into a 
council flat, where the family remain today.

Why did the family lose the house? ‘I
 never knew. I just came back from Nigeria and found we weren’t living 
in that house any more. I’ve never really wanted to press my parents on 
the subject. I just accepted what had happened and moved on.

‘It was a struggle. That’s why I 
spent a lot of time by myself, drawing. I didn’t have the luxury of 
going out and spending money.’

Today, his greatest pleasure is the 
pride he knows his success gives his parents. The other day, his local 
TV news carried a short item about him.

‘I don’t think I’ve ever seen my dad 
cry before. But he cried when he saw me and my art on the BBC. And my 
mum. Everyone was emotional. I was crying. It makes me feel happy to 
know I am making my family proud. That means the most to me. It makes me
 want to work harder and do more.’
