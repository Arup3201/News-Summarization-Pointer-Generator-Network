A 15-year-old prisoner accused of having fought for ISIS has described how the terrorists murder women who show their skin and drug young men to convince them to carry out suicide attacks.

A group of accused men are being held in northern Syria after being captured earlier this year by Kurdish troops battling to force the jihadists out of the area.

While many of the prisoners deny being involved, teenager Kareem Mufleh readily admits his links to ISIS - claiming he had been threatened with beheading if they did not join the terror group. 

Mufleh was eventually captured by Kurdish fighters in June, during a firefight in which he was shot three times in the stomach, leaving massive scars.

Experience: In order to ensure their largely reluctant recruits give their all in battle, ISIS makes them take the anti-anxiety drug Zolam to  make militants willing suicide bombers, 15-year-old Kareem Mufleh claimed

Claims: Accused fighter Kareem Mufleh (standing) described how Islamic State terrorists murder women who show their skin and are known to drug young men in order to convince them to carry out suicide bomb attacks

The men accused of being Islamic State fighters were interviewed in the basement of their prison in  northern Syria by Holly Williams, a correspondent for CBS News.

Among those interviewed was 15-year-old Kareem Mufleh, who openly tells of having fought for ISIS - something none of the other men in the jail admit to. His face was covered throughout the interview, presumably so ISIS fighters wouldn't recognise him.

But rather than joining the group voluntarily, Mufleh says the militants entered his village and gave all the men there the option of joining their campaign of terror or face being beheaded. 

In order to ensure their largely reluctant recruits give their all in battle, ISIS makes them take the anti-anxiety drug Zolam to make the fighters' willing suicide bombers, Mufleh claimed.

'That drug makes you lose your mind... If they give you a suicide belt and tell you to blow yourself up, you'll do it,' he said.

Injury: 15-year-old Kareem Mufleh revealed three large wounds on his stomach which he claims were received while fighting the Kurdish troops who would eventually take him captive

Describing the horrors of his time in ISIS' ranks, Mufleh says: 'I even saw them kill a woman because her wedding dress showed her neck and bare arms.'

He also revealed three large wounds on his stomach which he claims were received while fighting the Kurdish troops who would eventually take him captive. 

Mufleh's story is a long way from the myth ISIS likes to propagate, that its followers are pious men and women drawn to the group's hardline interpretation of Islam.

The reality in many cases is that ISIS' reputation for bloody violence is the only thing encouraging new recruits from within the many towns and villages the terror group has seized in recent months.

This morning a terror expert described how ISIS grooms Western fighters in much the same way as paedophiles do with children.

Militant: ISIS grooms new recruits online in much the same way as paedophiles do with children

Professor Greg Barton, from Australia's Monash University's Global Terrorism Research Centre, told AAP that recruiters lure targets by making friends through social media, like many sexual predators.

'Somebody might strike up a friendship in an online chat forum and present themselves in a different fashion - to try to get them into their web... By the time they actually meet the people they're speaking with, they may be in too deep to know better.'

While that approach may work with naive Western recruits, the reality is that for many of those already living under ISIS' bloody oppression, it is only the fear that the group's leadership will murder either them or their loved ones, that encourages militants to take up arms for the Islamic State.

Islamic State militants fighting in Syria and Iraq have released a sickening video of a young woman being stoned to death by a group of men - including her own father. 

The shocking footage is understood to have been filmed in the city of Hama and shows a bearded cleric ranting at the woman in Arabic and accusing her adultery while she pleads for her life.

The woman turns to her father and begs his forgiveness but he coldly rejects her, saying he would rather please God. He then turns to the men to give the signal for his daughter's murder to begin.

Terror: The bearded ISIS militant orders the woman to be 'content and happy' that she is about to be stoned to death because, he says, her death has been ordered by God. Her father (left) stands next to the extremist

Minutes later, as the men rain rocks down upon the helpless woman, her father steps forward with a large stone and the video fades to black.

It is believed he had been granted the barbaric 'honour' of being allowed end the life of the daughter he felt had betrayed both him and her religion. 

The sickening five-minute video emerged on ISIS-affiliated social media pages this morning. It is not clear when the footage was actually shot and has not been independently verified.

The exact accusations against the woman remain sketchy, although the cleric who appears at the start of mobile phone-filmed clip accuses her of committing adultery.
