Ralph Ellis runs you through what we learned from the weekend's football. This week, Luis Suarez seems to be feeling the pressure of being Liverpool's focal point as they try to get over the line, why Chelsea will miss Nemanja Matic in their quest for Champions League glory and Andros Townsend might be sweating on his World Cup place...

1. Is the pressure of trying to take Liverpool across the line to a Premier League title starting to affect Luis Suarez?

The
 Uruguayan has been on pretty much perfect behaviour all season with 
only four yellow cards all season before Sunday, compared with 11 last 
year as well as his controversial clash with Branislav Ivanovic.

On
 Sunday he took less than five minutes to get booked for a bad foul, and
 was fortunate not to get a second yellow for taking a tumble in search 
of a second half penalty.

Proceed with caution: Luis Suarez is shown the yellow card by Mark Clattenburg on Sunday

Taking a tumble: Suarez goes down a little easily under the challenge of Vincent Kompany

Frustration: Suarez has a moan as Martin Demichelis stands over him

2. If there is one player Chelsea will miss in their bid to land another Champions League it is midfielder Nemanja Matic.

The
 Serb, cup tied in Europe but a key part of the Premier 
League side since he returned to the club from Benfica for £21million in
 January, created Demba Ba’s winner at Swansea.

It
 was the fourth goal he’s made, but it is his defensive midfield work 
that has been key for Jose Mourinho.  In 13 games he’s now made 43 
tackles, 48 clearances and 28 interceptions.

3. Andros Townsend was being hailed as 
English football’s big new hope after he helped clinch World Cup 
qualification on his debut back in October but is now sweating on 
whether he’s even in the squad.

Recovered
 now from the hamstring injury which kept him out of the opening matches
 in Tim Sherwood’s time as Spurs boss, he hasn’t been able to force his 
way back in the team.

While 
fellow winger Aaron Lennon played a part in all three of Tottenham’s 
goals, Townsend was a sub for just the final five minutes at West Brom, 
and has only once played 90 minutes in the last 14 games when he has 
been fit.

4. Felix Magath started work at Fulham after the transfer deadline, so the only player he was able to sign was Mahamadou Diarra, who was out of work and trying to prove he’d beaten a persistent knee injury.

The former Real Madrid midfielder, released from Craven Cottage last summer because of his fitness issues, has proved an inspired choice.

Saturday’s win over Norwich made it two wins in two appearances for the 32-year-old whose work has given far more protection to Fulham’s fragile defence.

5. As if Sunderland didn’t have enough 
problems after five defeats in a row, they will have to do without 
defender Phil Bardsley for two of their last six games.

The
 28-year-old, branded 'the most unprofessional player I have ever worked
 with' by previous boss Paolo Di Canio, only had to negotiate one more 
game without a booking to reach the deadline to escape a ban under the 
FA’s totting up process.

Instead
 he picked up his 10th yellow card in 33 matches for a clumsy foul on 
Steven Naismith early in the second half of the 1-0 defeat by Everton.

6. Arsenal goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski did his chances of finding a new club no harm with his penalty shoot-out heroics in the FA Cup semi-final win over Wigan.

The 28-year-old, a free agent this summer after turning down a new deal at the Emirates because he wants regular first-team football, has not played a single Premier League game this season.

But in his cup appearances – which also included a penalties win at West Brom in the Capital One Cup – he’s let in just seven goals in nine matches.

Saving his career? Lukasz Fabianski's FA Cup penalty heroics might just help him find a new club

7. Noel Hunt has been a target for angry Leeds fans after a miserable season since his free transfer move from Reading – a midweek fanzine pointed out his record in 15 matches was no goals, no assists and just 10 shots.

The Republic of Ireland striker is still searching for his first goal but he does at least now have an assist to his name.

After coming on as sub it was his clever flick that opened up Blackpool’s back line to enable Luke Murphy to score the second of his goals in a 2-0 win.

8. With former Spurs and Reading midfielder Darren Caskey as his dad, and ex-Brentford and Reading stiker Nicky Forster now his step-dad, Brighton’s youngster Jake Forster-Caskey shouldn’t struggle for career guidance.

It’s not clear which of them – or whether it was both – advised him to turn down both Arsenal and Aston Villa as a youngster in the hope of getting more games if he signed for Brighton.

Either way it looks a good decision.  The England youth midfielder, who will be 20 later this month, has now played 31 games this season and got his third goal in the 3-0 win over Charlton that lifted the Seagulls into the Championship play-off zone.

Wise move: Jake Forster-Caskey turned down Arsenal and Aston Villa and is reaping the benefit at Brighton

9. David Marshall earned the Match of the Day plaudits for his saves that helped Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to a much needed win at Southampton, but there’s another Cardiff goalkeeper building a reputation behind him.

Simon Moore, 23, who moved to Wales from Brentford last summer, has helped Steve Cotterill work miracles at Bristol City since going there on loan.

When Moore arrived at Ashton Gate at the end of January, City were second from bottom and three points adrift of safety.  They have lost only two of seven games Moore has played since – and Saturday’s 1-0 win at Walsall lifted them to 13th place and the chance of a top half finish.

Safe hands: Simon Moore has been in excellent form on loan at Bristol City from Cardiff

10. Barnet went down from League Two with 51 points last season, and it is beginning to look as if it will need another record haul to achieve survival this term.The 46 points which Northampton have after a 1-0 win over Burton would have been enough to ensure survival in all but two of the 10 previous years.All the result did this time, however, was to set up Friday’s trip to Wycombe, above the 23rd-placed Cobblers on goal difference only, as a huge Easter encounter.
