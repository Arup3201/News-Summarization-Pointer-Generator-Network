Everton are flying the flag for England in the Europa League and take on Dynamo Kiev in the first leg of their round of 16 clash at Goodison Park on Thursday night.

Blues fans and perhaps even Roberto Martinez may have been happy to avoid giants such as Roma and Inter Milan, but face a Ukranian side who are unbeaten in their domestic league.

The Premier League strugglers may be the last British team left in Europe after next week's Champions League fixtures. So, do we know enough about their opponents?

Star players

Andriy Yarmolenko

Kiev's captain had a three-game ban reduced after an appeal so he can play in Thursday night's game, and his presence could be crucial for the visitors.

A creative winger, Yarmolenko loves cutting in from the right-hand side onto his favoured left foot and has impressed for Ukraine against England over the years. 

Martinez said: 'It is a blow from our point of view because Yarmolenko is one of their best performers.'

Aleksandar Dragovic

Linked with Arsenal and Tottenham, the defender is seen as a rising prospect of the game but is already a key player for Kiev. Their manager Sergei Rebrov confirmed as much.

'You are asking about one of the best players in my team and I don't want to lose this player.

'He is a top-class player and I hope he will stay with us.'

Miguel Veloso

A mainstay in a talented Portugal team, it was somewhat of a surprise when this central midfielder opted for a move to Ukraine when leaving Genoa last year.

Veloso has played at Goodison Park before, and will be hoping to prove his 52 international class convert to class on the field, too.

The manager

Sergei Rebrov should know all about Everton having played in the Premier League for five years with West Ham and most notably Tottenham.

The striker cost Spurs around £11million in 2000 but only scored 10 goals in 60 games... he will be hoping for better luck on English soil on this occasion.

The 40-year-old won the Ukranian Cup early on, and now looks to be on his way to more success this season.

He said in his pre-match conference: 'Any success for Dynamo is success for the whole of Ukraine. I hope people from outside can see that life is continuing here.'

Form

Thirteen wins from 16 games helping them establish a seven-point advantage over Shakhtar Donetsk in the league is one thing, but Kiev have brought that style to the Europa League, too.

The Ukrainian giants stormed through their group and beat Guingamp 4-3 on aggregate in their round of 32 fixture, despite going down to nine men in the first leg.
