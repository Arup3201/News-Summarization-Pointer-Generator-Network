A former 'teacher of the year' has been sentenced to 270 days behind bars after pleading guilty to having sex with a 17-year-old student.

Michelle Lynn Johnson, a 46-year-old married mother-of-two from Anaheim, California, was also sentenced to five years of formal probation. She must register as a sex offender during this time.

It came after she pleaded guilty to three felony counts of 
oral copulation of a minor and two felony counts of unlawful sexual 
intercourse, according to a release from the Orange County District Attorney's Office.

Johnson was arrested last June after the student's parents contacted police, saying they were concerned about her relationship with the boy.

The former Brea Olinda High math teacher, who was named 'teacher of the year' in 2009, met the teenager at the school and 'groomed' him, the DA's office said.

They went on to have a sexual relationship between April and June 2013.

Their trysts took place both at school and outside school, according to the DA's office.

At the time, the beloved teacher, who had worked at the school for eight years, also privately tutored several students off campus during non-school hours.

Following her arrest at her Anaheim home, she posted $20,000 bond and was put on paid administrative leave from the high school as investigations continued.

She was also restricted from going to the high school or any school activities.

Police had sought to find out whether there were any other victims, but she was not given any further charges relating to any other students.

At the sentencing hearing on Tuesday, the parents of the teenage victim said her crime had not only harmed their son, but also negatively affected them and the rest of their family.

Public records indicate she is married, while Facebook profiles show she has two teenage children, a boy and a girl.
