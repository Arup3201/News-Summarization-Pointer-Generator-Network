Narval Johnson, 62, sparked a bomb scare when he sent a council threatening letters containing curry powder

A man who sparked a bomb scare when he sent threatening letters containing curry powder to his local council walked free from court today.

Narval Johnson, 62, sent two envelopes containing coriander powder, garlic and black pepper to Wolverhampton City Council.

When the letters arrived in the building's mail room, staff feared the packages contained explosive Semtex - so removed them to a carpark.

They then evacuated and called police to inspect the contents.

Johnson, from Wolverhampton, West Midlands, who sent the letters as he was unhappy paying bills, admitted sending a total of 24 letters over a two month period but said it was just 'a joke'.

He
 denied a charge of sending a threatening letter for the purpose of 
causing distress or anxiety but was found guilty after a trial on 
January 3 this year.

Johnson - who had worked for tyre retailer Goodyear for 27 years - was spared jail when he appeared at Wolverhampton Magistrates Court on Friday.

Sentencing Johnson to a 12-week prison term suspended for two years, chairman of the bench Stephen Russell said: 'This is a very serious offence. The mere fact that you did this with innocuous material does not mitigate that fact.

'The people in the post room who received it were upset and potentially afraid.

'If you stay out of trouble nothing else will happen to you but if you do anything criminal again with the two years of the order you will almost certainly be sent to prison.'

The court heard many of his 24 threatening letters were addressed to ‘Satan People’ and had the number 666 written on them.

In one letter, Johnson - who was of previous good character - claimed he was owed £3 trillion in compensation by various agencies.

The package which sparked the scare comprised of two manila envelopes taped together, one of which was covered with crudely drawn crucifixes.

As well as the curry powder, one of the envelopes contained cut up bank cards and had written on one side: ‘To Barclaycard white old man’ and on the other: ‘All your s*** is inside’.

Two of the letters contained coriander powder, pictured, as well as garlic and black pepper. Staff feared the substance may be explosives

Prosecutor Roger Bleazard said: 'The hand writing on the package matched that of the person who had sent the threatening letters.

'This, coupled with its unusual smell, caused concern and distress. The explosive Semtex has a strange smell.

'If this had happened at a university during Rag Week without any background it might have been treated differently but this was at a council on alert because of terrorist concerns.'

The man sent a total of 24 letters to staff at Wolverhampton City Council (office pictured) as he was unhappy about paying bills. He received a 12-week suspended sentence for the crime

Defending Johnson, Mrs Bally Paul said he had sent the package as an ‘insult’ to Barclays and the council, adding that the distinctive smell of curry powder should have been enough to know it was not a threat.

He added: 'There was no report to the police about these letters until after the package had been received. He sent it out as an insult and then things got out of control.

'He has now tarnished his good name.'
