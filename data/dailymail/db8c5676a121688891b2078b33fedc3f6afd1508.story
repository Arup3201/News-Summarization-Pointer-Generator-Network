Getting out: Ryan Cleary, a member of the computer hacking group LulzSec, is to be released from prison despite possessing extreme child pornography

A hacker jailed for a global online rampage is to be freed within weeks despite being caught with sickening images of child abuse.

The 172 images found on Ryan Cleary’s computers included a six-month-old baby being sexually tortured and six repulsive videos.

More than 50 of the pictures were at level four, the second highest level of seriousness.

Cleary, 21, was jailed for more than two years last month over the cyber attack on organisations including the NHS and Serious Organised Crime Agency.

He was back in court yesterday to be sentenced over the child abuse images found when police investigating his hacking activities raided the home he shared with his mother in 2011.

Sentencing guidelines say anyone caught with a similar amount of material could serve up to 18 months in prison.

Judge Deborah Taylor admitted Cleary posed a ‘risk’ to children and ordered that he should never be alone with anyone under 16.

But she said it was in the ‘public interest’ for him to serve a community order as he had already served a ‘substantial’ amount of time in custody.

Because of his guilty pleas and the time served on remand or wearing an electronic tag, he will soon be released, Southwark Crown Court heard.

The decision to spare Cleary a further term behind bars provoked anger from child protection campaigners.

Claude Knights, director of charity Kidscape, said: ‘The making and possession of indecent images are horrendous crimes. Everything should be done to eliminate this trade.

'An important step would be to send out the strongest of messages to those that engage in it.

Decision: Judge Taylor admitted Cleary's: 'Images are such as would cause any right-minded person to be severely concerned', but still gave him a suspended sentence

‘At a time when there are so many concerns about the dark side of the internet this sentence gives us very little reassurance.’

John Carr, an expert in combating child abuse images, said: ‘The sentencing guidelines are very clear.

'These type of images normally mean jail but it seems the courts are less and less likely to follow that advice.

‘This is another symptom of the crisis that is engulfing this area of policy because the number of offenders is so large.’

Cleary, known as ‘Viral’, was a leading member of the LulzSec hacking gang who targeted Sony and the CIA as well as the NHS and Serious Organised Crime Agency.

The men dumped the personal details of hundreds of thousands of people on the internet and left a trail of destruction which cost at least £50million to fix.

Last month he was jailed for two years and eight months for his role in the attacks during which the gang described themselves as ‘Gods of Cyberspace’.

Yesterday Cleary, of Wickford, Essex, was ordered to serve a three-year community order, which includes a sex offenders’ treatment programme, for three charges related to child abuse images.

A sexual offences prevention order, which restricts his online access and bans him from speaking to people under 16 on the internet, was also imposed.

Cleary was barred from working with children and placed on the sex offenders’ register for five years.

Judge Taylor said: ‘Although the sentencing guidelines recommend an immediate custodial sentence, time has been served in any event.’

Ben Cooper, Cleary’s barrister, said he would be released ‘imminently’.

Cleary had earlier admitted two counts of making and one count of producing indecent images of children.

The court was told his life has been ‘blighted’ by mental health issues and self-harm and he split up with his girlfriend about six months ago.

An earlier hearing heard he suffers from Asperger’s syndrome and his decision to access the material was linked to his hacking activities.
