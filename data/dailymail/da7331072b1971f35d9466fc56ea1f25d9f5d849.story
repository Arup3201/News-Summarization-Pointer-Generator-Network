A major storm whipped Sydney with wild winds and torrential rain at the weekend and made one skipper's job very hard out on the rough harbour waters.

The sailing boat was travelling on the water in Sydney Harbour on Sunday afternoon at the same time as an enormous storm rolled in over the city.

One concerned passenger on a harbour ferry captured footage of the sailing boat battling against the wind and current.

A sailing boat collided with a ferry on Sydney Harbour on Sunday during wild weather

A storm was rolling into the city which made the skipper of this boat's job very difficult

In the video the boat's sails are full of wind and it appeared to be struggling to keep afloat and on course while battling the elements.

Ferry passengers lined the outside of the vessel to try and get a look at what turned out to be a rather dangerous situation.

The ferry blasted its horn repeatedly as the sailing boat edged closer and closer to the larger vessel. 

Then, much to the horror of gasping ferry passengers, the smaller vessel slammed into the side of the ferry.

On Sunday Sydneysiders said farewell to summer as a day of early near-record high temperatures gave way to severe storms in the afternoon.

The first day of Autumn saw the seasons change in dramatic fashion as a picturesque sunny sky turned stormy shortly after 3:30pm.

Storms rolled in from the south, bringing with them 100km/h winds, torrential rain and hail across much of the city.
