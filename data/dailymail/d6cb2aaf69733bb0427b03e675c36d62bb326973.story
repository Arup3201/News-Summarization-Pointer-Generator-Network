Michael Jackson's doctor on Tuesday asked for a publicly-funded lawyer to handle his appeal on a manslaughter conviction in the pop star's death, saying he could not afford to pay for one himself.

Dr Conrad Murray, serving a four-year jail term for the involuntary manslaughter of Jackson in 2009, filed papers with Los Angeles Superior Court saying he was unable to fund his legal help any longer.

'The defendant is indigent and respectfully requests the appointment of counsel on appeal,' the court papers said.

Fight: Conrad Murray was sentenced for involuntary manslaughter after a six-week trial giving the most detailed account yet of Jackson's final hours

Murray indicated in a two-page court 
filing that he would rely on a court-funded attorney to help craft his 
appeal for both his conviction and his sentence. The U.S. Supreme Court 
has ruled that felony convicts have a constitutional right to assistance
of counsel.

The 58-year-old cardiologist had 
hired two lawyers for his six-week trial, but he was convicted in 
November of involuntary manslaughter, or gross negligence, after 
admitting he gave the 'Thriller' singer nightly doses of the surgical anaesthetic propofol to help him sleep.

The drug is normally given in 
hospital settings with extensive monitoring equipment, but testimony 
showed Murray had only basic equipment and left Jackson’s bedside on the
morning of Jackson's June 25, 2009 death, at age 50 - just weeks before
a series of planned comeback concerts.

Shortly after Murray's request, his 
newly-appointed civil attorney, Charles Peckham, said on Tuesday 
sheriff’s deputies appear to be subjecting Murray to more security than 
other inmates at Men’s Central Jail and that the physician was left 
heavily shackled during their jailhouse meeting.

Although Mr Peckham said his client 
is coping with tight security and isolation he said he remains 
optimistic he will win the an upcoming appeal.

'Treating him like Hannibal Lecter is
offensive,' Mr Peckham said, referring to the fictional serial killer 
from popular books and films. A sheriff’s officials defended the 
security measures, saying they were for Murray’s safety.

The attorney had to obtain a court 
order Tuesday to meet with Murray to discuss strategy on a wrongful 
death lawsuit filed by Jackson’s father. Mr Peckham said despite the 
judge’s order, he was denied entry to the jail, but officials relented 
after speaking with the civil trial court handling the case.

He said their initial 30-minute 
meeting was cut short when the jail was placed in lockdown, but Mr 
Peckham said the time was enough to upset him and see that Murray’s 
fortunes had dramatically changed.

Civil defender: Charles Peckham will craft Murray's appeal

'This man who saved lives made a 
mistake, and they’re going to him pay like a mass-murderer,' Mr Peckham 
said. The doctor spoke extensively to documentary filmmakers before his 
conviction, but few details of his life behind bars have been divulged.

Murray 'is a real target because of 
his notoriety and because of the Michael Jackson connection,' sheriff’s 
spokesman Steve Whitmore said. 'We’re just being extra cautious right 
now.'

He said jail officials will evaluate 
how to handle Murray’s incarceration, but that he may not serve his 
whole sentence in isolation from other inmates. He noted that without a 
recent change in state law, Murray would be serving his term in state 
prison, not a county lock-up.

Mr Peckham said Murray, who has been 
jailed since a jury convicted him of involuntary manslaughter on 
November 7, is optimistic that an appellate court will grant an appeal 
on the case.

His visit came hours after the 
physician, who was never paid the $150,000 a month he expected for 
serving as Jackson’s personal physician, asked the court to provide a 
publicly funded attorney to handle his appeal because he is indigent.

J Michael Flanagan, who was one of 
Murray’s criminal defence lawyers, agreed with Mr Peckham’s description.
He said that when he visited Murray recently, four deputies escorted 
the physician into the meeting room and shackled him to a table.

'He can’t even scratch his nose,' the
attorney said. Mr Flanagan said he saw another inmate who was charged 
with murder meet with his attorney without the same restrictive 
measures.

'This is because of his notoriety,' Mr Whitmore said. 'It’s not so much the crime itself.'

Mr Flanagan and Murray’s other 
criminal attorneys had sought to present evidence to jurors about 
Jackson’s finances, details of his deal for a series of comeback 
concerts, and information about other doctors treating the pop 
superstar. But the judge refused and ruled the trial would be about 
Murray’s care of the singer.

Mr Peckham said he didn’t 'think the 
sheriff’s department is being anything but professional. I do however 
believe the amount of security for Dr Murray is vastly out of proportion
with the potential threat.'

He said Murray told him he appreciates the support and prayers he’s received from former patients and friends.

In the early days of his confinement,
Murray was classified as suicidal in jail records, according to a 
probation report. Mr Peckham said he saw no indications that the 
physician intended to take his own life and that he seemed to be in 
control of his mental health.

Meanwhile, Pastor has scheduled a 
hearing for January 23 to decide whether to order Murray to pay any 
restitution to Jackson’s family or reimburse them for funeral expenses, 
which totaled more than $1.8million.

Jackson’s estate estimated the singer
would have earned at least $100million if he had performed his 'This Is
It' concerts planned for London’s O2 arena.

Murray will lose his medical license as a result of the conviction is upheld.
