A body of a mother who had been reported missing was discovered in a farmer's combine harvester.

Tashyra McDowell, 24, died of multiple gunshot wounds before being wedged into the farm equipment, according to police who had launched a murder investigation.

Her body was discovered last Tuesday in a cornfield in Peoria, Illinois.

An autopsy last Wednesday found McDowell died of multiple gunshot wounds before her body was forced into the farm equipment.

McDowell was the mother of a seven-year-old autistic boy who was found alone last Monday morning in the Illinois city.

Later that day McDowell's car was found abandoned. Her mother, Twila Rutherford, said she last had contact with her daughter on Friday.

McDowell's son is now with Rutherford, who says the boy was her daughter's 'pride and joy'.

The Peoria County coroner pronounced McDowell dead on Tuesday afternoon.

It took authorities about two hours to disassemble the eight-row corn picker to remove her body.

McDowell's ex-boyfriend, 25-year-old Stephen Turner, was allegedly one of the last people to see her alive, and was placed in police custody on Monday on weapons charges. He was released on Wednesday
