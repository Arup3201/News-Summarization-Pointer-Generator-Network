A father has shot dead his wife and their toddler son before turning the gun on himself, police have said.

Brian Miller, 41, was overheard arguing with his wife of five years, 29-year-old Kara Miller, at their home in Spaulding County, Georgia on Friday, WSBTV reported.

When relatives did not hear from the couple over the weekend, they asked the Sheriff's Office to perform a welfare check and the three bodies were discovered inside the house on Sunday.

It appears that Miller - who was described by relatives as a religious man - shot his wife and their 21-month-old son Paxton in the heads with a handgun before turning the weapon on himself.

Police could not say how long the three bodies had been inside the home.

An autopsy will be conducted on the family at the Georgia Bureau of Investigation Crime Lab on Monday, authorities said.

Brian Miller's daughter from a previous relationship told WSBTV that she did not believe her father could be responsible for the killings.

Ashley Miller, who is pregnant and plans to name her child after her dad if it's a boy, said the couple had just celebrated their fifth wedding anniversary and seemed to have a good marriage.

'I just want to make sure everybody knows he's not that kind of person,' she said. 'He's very church involved. He's very religious. He's a good dad and he didn't deserve something like this.'

Neighbors called Kara Miller a perfect wife.

'It's just hard. She was a perfect wife and he was a perfect son, and if the dad didn't see that he was missing something,' said neighbor Britteny Buck.

According to her social media profiles, Kara Miller worked as a freelance hair and makeup artist in the Atlanta metro area. Images also show her posing in model shots or smiling happily with her young son. 

On Sunday night, her mother, Nancy Sebben, expressed her grief on her Facebook page.

'My heart is broken beyond repair, no parent should every be put thru such torment..I will die of a broken heart. I loved my babies more than life itself, and am thankful I told them everyday.'
