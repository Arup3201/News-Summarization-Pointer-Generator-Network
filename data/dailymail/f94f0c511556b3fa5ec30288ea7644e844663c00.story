She's got one of the most honed bodies in showbiz - and now the secret workout behind Nicole Scherzinger's toned physique has been revealed.

The popstar, who is currently playing Grizabella in Andrew Lloyd Webber's record-breaking musical Cats, has joined an invite-only fitness class.

Nicole, 36, has been hanging out at SBC, which stands for the Skinny B**** Collective, and is the go-to gym for fashion's most famous fitness fanatics.

Nicole Scherzinger, 36, has been working out at The Skinny B**** Collective classes, where primal movements in intense circuits including upside-down burpees and crawling are seen as the hottest way to get healthy

Run by super-trainer Russell Bateman, SBC is an elite and intense 50-minute circuits style class loved by Millie Mackintosh,  Suki Waterhouse and model Zara Martin.

Nicole, 36, posted a video of her working out at the class, which has attendees crawling on their hands and knees and doing one-legged burpees (jumping upright from a press-up position).

Speaking about working with the star, Russell said: 'I had the opportunity to train Nicole last week and she was incredibly nimble and explosive. 

'A dancer's background can really help you acclimatise to the movements much quicker.

'When Nicole posted her SBC video some of the reactions were insane. People couldn't believe what she was capable of.

'But the overwhelming factor was that it had inspired them.' 

The brains behind the SBC brand, Russell Bateman, said Nicole was 'incredibly nimble and explosive' and that having a dancer's background like hers can really help  acclimatise to the movements much quicker

Looking to get fit like Nicole in 2015? FEMAIL caught up with the brains behind the brand to find out his top fitness and health tips.

Sharing his advice for anyone looking to embark on a New Year’s health kick, Russell said: 'Making peace with where you are at right now in your life is the first step to self-acceptance and making lasting changes. 

'If you want to lose body fat, feel great, increase your energy level and improve your overall quality of life, then there are a list of lifestyle choices and changes you can make.

'My aim through SBC is to abolish the misconceptions around how women train, eat and live.

'Low fat diets are out, good fat is your friend. 

'Be as human as possible when you train. Boredom is the enemy and so is anyone around you who's bringing you down.

'Remember to never underestimate yourself and overestimate others too much. I advocate sleep, squatting, sprinting and lots of sex for a great body and mind.'

Too cold to jog outdoors? No excuses, said Russell. 'Make sure you try to move and not end up like a slug. 

'Indulging over the Christmas period is the norm but it's not an excuse to do nothing. That's the quickest way to get your body resembling some yoghurt wrapped in cling film.'

In terms of being active indoors, Russell believes that body-weight circuits can really help.

He suggests doing 10 press-ups, 10 squat jumps and a plank for one minute. 'It's simple but effective. Try it a few times, it will really energise you,' he said.

Nicole posted a video of her demonstrating her fitness at the class. Attendees follow trainer Russell Bateman's strict regime which dictates how much they should sleep and exactly what to eat

Russell trains  world-famous models. His class is 'the toughest workout for women in London'

Russell explained that the more goals you make, the less likely you are to achieve them - and you should choose your friends wisely.

'Lack of social support can increase stress and anxiety, which weaken your ability to stick to your goals,' he said. 

'In order to succeed with your New Year’s resolutions, support from friends and family is key. If your friends draw you toward bad influences your first goal should be to get some new ones.'

In terms of eating, Russell advises his clients to consume a diet full of high protein and healthy fats full of omega-3 fatty acids at least an hour before  training and high protein and fibre after. '

'This will lead to some great changes in your body composition and mood,' he said.

Think salmon, cod, wild meat like venison or buffalo with vegetables such as kale and broccoli. Sweet potato and quinoa are staples on Russell's watch, too.

The best news? Snacks are in. 'Many people avoid snacks because they are afraid that they contribute to weight gain,' he said.

But in truth, snacks can be included in a plan to lose body fat and improve your functions throughout the day. An SBC snack will consist of protein and healthy fats and fibre.'

He also maintains that omega-3 and vitamin D levels are crucial for optimal body function and mood, so can be taken as supplements.

Unfortunately for anyone hoping to train alongside Nicole, Russell's classes are very exclusive. 

Explaining his invite-only policy, Russell said: 'This is the toughest workout for women in London. There is no class like this out there. It's constantly evolving and constantly changing. It's illusive - some say exclusive - and will probably continue to be so.

'Girls know that I train some very high profile people who are healthy and embrace fitness. They see them performing SBC movements and eating with our guidelines and then naturally want to be involved. There is a cult-like following now. It's crazy!'. 

Russell has been overwhelmed with the response from people and brands wanting to get a slice of the SBC action and he is launching online tutorials for anyone who wants to try Nicole's workout

While you may not be able to try out your upside-down burpees alongside the A-list, Russell is launching the next best thing.

In the New Year, the SBC experience will allow fitness fanatics to take part in his workout virtually.

'This will be a complete encyclopedia of SBC movements and advice that you can subscribe to either annually or monthly. 

'You'll be able to train our way wherever you are in the world from the palm of your hand,' he said.

Thanks to his celebrity fans posting their workouts online, Russell has been overwhelmed with the response from people and brands wanting to get a slice of the SBC action. 

But he remained mysterious, saying: 'There will also be some really special pop-ups and collaborations, too. All to be revealed soon....'

Sleep more

It's the key. Sleep is the one thing I ask girls about before they train with us. It's the primary time that the body recovers from exercise and it's also when you'll be rebuilding torn muscle tissues. Skip sleep or get less than adequate amounts and you’ll increase cortisol again - a hormone that suppresses physical activity and fat burning processes in the body. It will also increase hunger. If you can't sleep check your magnesium levels, as a deficiency could be to blame. So on nights where you’re staying in go to bed at 10pm.

Have more sex

It will boost your immunity and relieve stress. A female orgasm can more than double a woman's tolerance for pain because it’s an analgesic not an anaesthetic meaning it suppresses pain. That should have a beneficial effect on your training intensity.

Stay in the present moment

That is being 'in the now’ as much as you can. Make sure your breathing is full and deep. It’s the best detox possible. Anything can be a meditation (walking, yoga, cooking, sex, taking out the trash).

Mix up your workouts

For your body and your brain. SBC workshops are perfect stimuli for that. Dancing is not a luxury, it’s an imperative. Even if it’s when you’re alone in the morning before you start your day - it’s time for a morning dance.

Be in nature as much as possible

Throw away your television and read more. Spend less time on your phone and only answer your emails once a day. Limit social media like Instagram and Twitter. It's procrastinating and you get lost in a strange world based on peer pressure and competitive boasting. Hold eye contact during a conversation.

Love yourself unconditionally

Or you can never love anyone else unconditionally. Judgement is so boring. Don’t judge. Take nothing, not even the stuff directed towards you, personally.
