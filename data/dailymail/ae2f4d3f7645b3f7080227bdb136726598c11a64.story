The wife of a celebrated millionaire architect has been found ‘frozen to death’ in a car after she and her husband were involved in an acrimonious split.

Nicole Falkingham, 41, is believed to have died from hypothermia and acute alcohol poisoning after drinking heavily and apparently falling asleep in a car on a friend’s driveway.

Wearing a hooded quilted jacket and Hunter wellington boots, she spent the night in the car in sub-zero temperatures and was found dead on the back seat the next morning.

Her death comes after she told friends
she was fighting a bitter divorce battle against her estranged husband,
Jonathan Falkingham, 50 – the chief executive of a multi-million pound 
property firm.

The couple were known as ‘property 
royalty’ and lived an enviable and glamorous lifestyle. But Mrs 
Falkingham and her husband had separated last year amid bitter 
recriminations.

She moved out of their £1million 
converted farmhouse and had told friends she was beginning divorce 
proceedings with the aim of securing a generous settlement.

But Mr 
Falkingham’s development firm, Urban Splash, has debts of more than 
£200million, according to the latest accounts.

Mrs Falkingham, who was often seen out
in pubs and clubs, had gone out on Thursday evening. She had been 
drinking in a wine bar with friends when she suddenly become ‘comatose.’

Bar staff alerted the emergency 
services but before they arrived she was allegedly picked up by friends 
who took her to their home on a cul-de-sac in upmarket Otterspool.

She 
was found dead in the back of a black Vauxhall Insignia on the drive 
last Friday morning after temperatures fell to -2C.

of her death

A man and woman, both 48, were 
arrested at a house nearby after police discovered a cannabis factory 
with more than 100 plants at the property.

Staff at the Vinci wine bar in Liverpool said Mrs Falkingham was seen happily drinking with four friends.

An employee said the group had drunk a ‘couple of bottles of wine’ when Mrs Falkingham changed dramatically.

He said: ‘She went from being OK to 
suddenly being in a near comatose state. I’ve seen plenty of people get 
drunk but I have never seen someone turn as quickly as that.

‘I tried to speak to her to see if she
was okay but she couldn’t speak. I called the police and they told me 
to phone an ambulance, but before I had the chance, some friends of hers
turned up and took her away.’

Officers are treating the death as 
‘unexplained’ and questioned the pair on suspicion of manslaughter and 
cultivating cannabis before they were freed on bail.

A post mortem examination has taken 
place and initial results have indicated hypothermia and acute alcohol 
intake. But officers said the conclusions will be subject to toxicology 
tests before any confirmation will be made.

A high-profile couple, the Falkinghams
were patrons of the arts and were well-known on the party-circuit. They
met when she began working at Urban Splash as personal assistant to the
married father-of-two more than a decade ago.

They began dating in 2003 after he 
separated from his wife and then bought an abandoned 17th century 
farmhouse which they transformed into a designer £1million home.

Urban Splash was at the forefront of 
property development in the North West –  turning decaying mills and 
warehouses into exclusive apartments.

It was widely credited for 
kick-starting the trend for city-centre living in cities such as 
Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds and Bristol. But the downturn hit the firm 
and last September it posted pre-tax losses of £9.3million and debts of 
£234million.

Mr Falkingham, chief executive of 
Urban Splash, was a former Young Entrepreneur of the Year, and has a 
first class degree in architecture from Liverpool University.

A source said: ‘Jonathan and Nicole 
were like royalty within the circle of architects and developers in the 
North-West. They were a rich and attractive couple living a gilded 
lifestyle.’ The source added that Mrs Falkingham ‘was known to dabble in
recreational drugs’.

Mr Falkingham was unavailable for comment.
