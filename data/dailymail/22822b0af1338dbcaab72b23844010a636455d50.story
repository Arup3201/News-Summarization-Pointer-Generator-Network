A happy childhood means healthier hearts and circulation in adulthood, new research found.

Children brought up in a loving home who do not go without, eat healthier foods, have friends and have learnt to control their aggression and impulsiveness have better cardiovascular health in later life than deprived children.

The Finnish study found those with 'favourable psychosocial experiences' gained additional advantages that saw them through as adults.

These included a 14 per cent greater chance of being at normal weight as an adult, a 12 per cent greater chance of being a non-smoker and 11 per cent greater chance to have a healthy glucose level.

Dr Laura Pulkki-Råback at the University of Helsinki said: 'The choices parents make have a long-lasting effect on their children's future health, and improvement in any one thing can have measurable benefits.

'For instance, if an unemployed parent gets steady employment, the effect may be huge.

'If he or she also quits smoking, the benefit is even greater. All efforts to improve family well-being are beneficial.'

The study published in the American Heart Association journal Circulation found participants with the most psychosocial advantages in youth scored higher on an ideal cardiovascular health index in adulthood than those with the least psychosocial advantages.

It involved 3,577 children aged from three to 18 and measured their socioeconomic status, emotional stability, parental health behaviours, stressful events, self-regulation of behavioural problems and social adjustment.

Of the group, researchers assessed 1,089 of the participants 27 years later when they were aged between 30 and 45 to determine their level of ideal cardiovascular health.

It found favourable socioeconomic status and self-regulatory behaviour, meaning good aggression and impulse control, in childhood were the strongest predictors of ideal cardiovascular health in adulthood.

The study also highlighted the importance of early life stages - periods during which other studies have proven cardiovascular diseases begin to root.

Dr Pulkki-Råback added: 'Scientific evidence supports the fact that investing in the well-being of children and families will be cost effective in the long run because it decreases healthcare costs at the other end of life.

'The knowledge is out there, and now it is a question of values and priorities.'
