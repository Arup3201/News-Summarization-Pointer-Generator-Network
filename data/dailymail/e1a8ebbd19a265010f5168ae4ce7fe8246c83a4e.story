Disbelief: Actor Ricky Tomlinson had been using the caravan as a base while filming a wildlife documentary

When Ricky Tomlinson bought a six-berth static caravan he found it to be the perfect place for a ‘bit of peace and quiet’.

But the 72-year-old actor’s peace has been shattered after thieves stole the £12,000 retreat from its picturesque riverside site.

Mr Tomlinson – who played Jim Royle in the BBC sitcom The Royle Family – said yesterday that he was ‘gutted’.

A gang took the 27ft caravan from the banks of the Dee in what the actor described as a ‘well-organised’ crime.

He pleaded for the return of his ‘hobby’ home, which he was using as a base to film wildlife for a  TV documentary, and said: ‘I can’t believe it happened. It must  have been a well-organised gang of thieves because it is a big, six-berth caravan which was not even on wheels.

‘It was 2ft off the floor and resting on railway sleepers and breeze blocks because it was on a flood plain. The caravan was down a country lane over a mile long within a gated private meadow.

‘They took the gate off its hinges and must have had a decent-sized vehicle to take it away.

‘I am gutted because I was in the process of letting one of my mates use it for a little outing for his two kids.’ Although Mr Tomlinson didn’t discover the theft until the weekend he believes the caravan may have been taken late last Wednesday or Thursday.

He added: ‘I have only had it for a couple of years and it is still in sparkling condition – it is immaculate. The plastic covering was still on the seats.

‘The caravan was in a great spot and I have filmed wildlife there, including woodpeckers, squirrels and buzzards, for a documentary I have been working on – just a little independent film.

‘There was everything there and it was a lovely place to go for a bit of peace and quiet.’ The Hobby 635 caravan was parked in a meadow in the village of Farndon in Cheshire.

Man of the people: A scene from the 1999 TV drama Dockers, which, with its story of picketing workers in Liverpool, bore a resemblance to Tomlinson's trade union activist past

Lesley Chadderton, landlady of the Greyhound pub in the High Street, said: ‘This is a peaceful village and we often see Ricky walking through and he always waves and says hello.

‘He is lovely and has a good heart and I can’t believe that someone has stolen his caravan – it is disgusting.’

Mr Tomlinson and his wife Rita have a detached house  in a suburb of Liverpool as well as a two-bedroom townhouse  near Benidorm and a three-bedroom penthouse on Turkey’s Aegean coast.Cheshire police are investigating the theft of his caravan.
