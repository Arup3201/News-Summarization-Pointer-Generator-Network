Mark Vevers has been jailed for luring a female loan company worker to his home and robbing her at gunpoint

A one-legged thug who robbed a woman after pulling a gun from under his wheelchair has been jailed.

Amputee Mark Vevers, 50, who has tattoos across his face and head, lured a debt collector to his house where he held her at gunpoint.

He told the woman, who has not been named, to wait in his bathroom where she feared she would be killed and evidence washed away.

Vevers stole her bank card and demanded her pin number before going to a nearby cash point and withdrawing £300 from her account.

Northampton Crown Court heard Vevers also took £485 in cash from the woman, who had previously visited his home to collect repayments for online firm 'LoansAtHome4U'.

He had been repaying a £300 loan to the company at £20 per week, and invited his victim there on the pretence that a friend who wanted to borrow some money was coming round.

The court heard Vevers' victim begged ‘200 times’ to be released from her hour-and-a-half gunpoint ordeal.

Once he finally let her go, Vevers was arrested by armed police at a friend's house shortly after the incident on January 25 this year.

The gun turned out to be an airgun, which Vevers told officers he kept for shooting rats.

He told them he had needed the money from the woman so he could pay off a drugs debt.

Judge Richard Bray sentenced Vevers to six and a half years in prison after he pleaded guilty to false imprisonment, possessing a firearm, robbery and theft.

Passing sentence, he said: ‘You lured the victim into your home, when she was there you produced a gun, you threatened to kill her with it, you demanded that she go into you bathroom.

‘The victim must have been absolutely terrified and in fear of immediate death.

Mark Vevers's victim believed this imitation firearm was a real gun and pleaded to be let go 200 times while being held for 90 minutes

‘You were quite prepared to use this woman as a pawn in dealing with your own financial problems.’

The judge refused to sentence Vevers at an earlier hearing and ordered psychiatric reports to be prepared.

He quipped: ‘This is so bizarre and so absurd there could be some kind of mental illness.

‘He was bound to get caught, the phrase 'nowhere to run' is particularly poignant in this case.’

Vevers, from Northampton, has a number of previous convictions, including attacking an ex-girlfriend with a Stanley knife.

Detective Constable Cathy O'Connor said after the case: ‘I am delighted with the sentence that has been handed down.

‘Although the gun was an imitation firearm, the victim did not know this and she believed that Vevers would kill her during the course of this crime.

‘I would like to thank the victim for her bravery in assisting with the investigation.’
