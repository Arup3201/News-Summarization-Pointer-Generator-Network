When former teammates get back together there are always a few surprises, but Neil Ruddock may have taken that a step further than usual.

Liverpool legends Jamie Redknapp and Jamie Carragher got a lot more than they bargained for when 'Razor' Ruddock met up with them this week.

Ruddock was with the two Sportsmail columnists on Sky One's A League of their own, and put on a show for his fellow defenders, performing a strip tease.

The 46-year-old, dressed in a police uniform, stripped down to just his Y-fronts and a police jacket, leaving Redknapp and Carragher looking shocked.

The trio played together at Liverpool before Ruddock left Anfield for West Ham in 1998.

The show will be aired at 10pm on Sky One on Friday night, as regulars James Corden, Andrew Flintoff, Jack Whitehall and Redknapp are joined by Carragher, Kirsty Gallagher and Jimmy Carr.

It also features Corden taking part in 'human archery' by being fired across the studio, and the teams take on Olympian Iwan Thomas in a triathlon while answering questions.
