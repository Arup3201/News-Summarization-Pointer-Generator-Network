A pilot flying a small plane with a marriage proposal banner attached crashed into the Block Island Sound Monday after an engine failure. Though pilot Mark Simmons was miraculously unharmed, the proposal wasn't made.

Mr Simmons bravely took to the skies only one day after his harrowing crash, again toting the banner, which read, ‘Michelle, Will You Marry Me? Mike,’ which was commissioned by Mike Flynn, who wanted to propose to his girlfriend, Michelle.

Michelle, who was curious why her boyfriend was pacing the beach for two days in a row, was shocked by the romantic gesture - and said yes to his proposal.

Mr Simmons had terrible luck Monday when the engine on his Piper Pawnee cut out, and he was left to make an emergency landing in the Sound.

But he courageously took to the skies yesterday to finish the job he started, showing his 8-year-old son Ethan that it was important to get up after falling, according to ABC 6.

Ethan sent a message to the Coast Guard after his father let out several mayday calls. He played an integral part in his father’s rescue.

Mr Flynn was on a nearby beach. He told ABC News that he was ‘really worried’ the entire time, and was pacing back and forth.

Mr Simmons was rescued by a Good Samaritan who was passing by on his boat, and was unharmed. Mr Flynn told ABC News that the pilot rang him up with an apology, and a request: to try the proposal flight another time.

So yesterday, Mr Simmons again took to the skies with the banner flowing behind his new plane. Mr Flynn officially proposed to his girlfriend, Michelle.

She was suspicious why it took him so long to pop the question. She told ABC News: ‘I wasn’t sure why it took him two days of pacing the beach just to propose to me on the beach…until I saw the plane.’

Mr Simmons was flying his Piper Pawnee plane, having taken off from the Westerly Airport Monday afternoon.

Connecticut’s The Day reported that he lost power 10 minutes into his flight. The Coast Guard, hearing his call, sent out a helicopter and a response boat.

Mr Simmons’ son Ethan helped the Coast Guard quicken their search, telling them that his father had just taken off.

Meanwhile, Mr Simmons was preparing for the crash landing. He told The Westerly Sun that he removed his seat belt and grabbed a floating tire.

Even though he was calm and prepared, he told the paper: ‘Nothing prepares you for sitting in the ocean by yourself.’

By the time the Coast Guard arrived, Mr Simmons had already been rescued from the Block Island Sound by a civilian boater.

Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Bryan Swintek told the Day that the Good Samaritan pulled him from the water near Ninigret Pond, near Charlestown, Rhode Island.

Lt. Swintek said that Mr Simmons was taken to a nearby hospital for evaluation, but was not seriously hurt. 

‘He was incredibly calm,’ Lt Swintek said. But Mr Simmons’ plane was not so lucky. The Coast Guard told MailOnline that the Piper Pawnee sunk to the bottom of the Sound.
