A jobless mother-of-eleven was today told she will not be getting her palatial new taxpayer-funded home - because the £500,000 property doesn’t meet her needs.

A storm of protest had erupted over the six-bedroom property being specially built for Heather Frost, who also keeps a horse.

Frost, 37, who has never worked and whose children were fathered by four different men, was due to move into the house in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, at the end of this month.

Access denied: Jobless mother-of-11 Heather Frost was just weeks away from moving into this £500,000 eco-house courtesy of the taxpayer. Now the housing association has said it does not meet her needs

But Severn Vale Housing Society announced yesterday: 'Three properties on this site, which include the six-bed home, have not yet been allocated.

'With Tewkesbury Borough Council, we are currently working through the allocations process to identify households with suitable needs.

'I can confirm that Heather Frost was never guaranteed the property and she will not be moving into it. We decided that it does not meet her needs.'

A spokeswoman from Tewkesbury Borough Council refused to comment on why the lavish property failed to meet Ms Frost's needs.

She said: 'We are unable to comment on changes to an applicant’s housing needs.'

Frost currently lives with her children, aged from three to 21, in two terraced houses that have been knocked together.

A current neighbour, who refused to give his name, said: 'I'm gutted. I think everyone is.

'We were going to throw a street party when she finally moved away. She's been bragging to everyone how great her new house is.'

The house that was lined up for her has three bathrooms, a large open-plan kitchen-diner and two lounges with French windows overlooking a spacious garden.

The 1,850 sq ft detached property was designed with state-of-the-art technology to cut electricity bills - which Frost could have claimed benefits to pay.

Robert Oxley, of the Taxpayer’s Alliance, said: 'This utter farce has wasted taxpayers’ money and exposed deep flaws in our broken welfare system.

'The council has spent a fortune building a home that most of us could only dream of living in.

'Benefits are there to help vulnerable people not fund a lifestyle that taxpayers couldn’t afford themselves.'

One of Frost’s former neighbours, widow Doreen Freeman, 81, kept a diary of the misery she said she suffered at her hands.

Her son Dr James Freeman said his late mother’s greenhouse was smashed, excrement was thrown into her garden and a soiled mattress was set on fire in her garden.

Dr. Freeman, said: 'Frost was never worthy of this palatial offering.

'It smacks of a huge U-turn. They more or less promised the house, she bragged about it and now they say they can’t give it to her.

'Frost operated in the most callous and unfeeling fashion toward my mother and it will come as a relief to whoever moves in to this new development that the Frosts won’t be a part of it.

'She ruined the final years of my mum’s life.'

Frost refused to comment on the alleged abuse.

Frost’s proposed new home was organised by Tewkesbury Borough Council who sold a plot of land to Severn Vale Housing Association for a discounted price of £210,000.

A spokesman from Severn Vale Housing Society said: ''I can confirm that Heather Frost was never guaranteed the property and she will not be moving into it. We decided that it does not meet her needs'

They placed a condition on the sale that one of the 13 homes being built would be big enough for a large family. At the time the council’s Lead Member for the Built Environment Derek Davies said: 'We have a duty to provide appropriate accommodation to people who are at risk of homelessness.

'Mrs Frost’s family has been living in temporary accommodation, consisting of two houses, for a very long time because there have been no other suitable properties available.

'This is an excellent example of the council working in partnership with registered providers, using public land to develop more affordable housing in line with government policy.

'We were able to sell land owned by the borough council to Severn Vale for them to develop 13 affordable homes, including this unit to meet the particular needs of Mrs Frost and her family.

'By providing this larger affordable property, the two houses currently occupied by the family will be available for other families in need.'

Frost first fell pregnant when she was 15 to a 23 year-old boyfriend who ended up in prison.

She was left sterile after a bout of cervical cancer in 2011 and is already a grandmother.

Her children are Sophie, 21, Toby, 19, Angel, 16, Jay, 14, Chloe, 13, Paige, 12, Emily, ten, Bethany, nine, Ruby, seven, Daisy, six, and Tilly, who is three.

She has said: 'Some other mums have called me a slag but I love all of my children. I’d love to have more kids if I could.'

She declined to comment when approached at her current home in Gloucester yesterday.

Charity worker Rebecca Joy, who started an online petition in February calling for Heather to be given the property, said: 'Whatever your views are on this mother’s lifestyle choices, the fact of the matter is that there are 11 children that need somewhere to live.'
