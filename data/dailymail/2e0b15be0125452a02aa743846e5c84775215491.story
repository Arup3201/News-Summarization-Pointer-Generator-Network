Church treasurer Jill Gover (pictured) killed herself days after being confronted about  missing funds

A church treasurer who stole more than £140,000 from organisations she volunteered for after amassing huge debts killed herself after being confronted over the thefts.

Jill Gover, 54, from Wool, in Dorset, was a respected and trusted member of her local community, serving as a church warden, book keeper for the village hall and trustee of a wealthy colleague's trust fund.

But she racked up debts of £225,000 which included a £112,000 mortgage on a Grade II listed country cottage, £38,000 for two BMW cars, three bank loans of £50,000, five maxed-out credit cards totalling £21,000 and a £5,700 clothing catalogue bill.

She kept the debts and subsequent thefts hidden from her husband Martin.

Mr Gover said he was 'lost for words' after hearing the full extent of his wife's duplicity at her inquest.

The inquest heard Mrs Gover siphoned off £50,466 from the coffers of  Holy Rood Church, in Wool, over a number of years. 

As treasurer she made numerous church cheques out to herself after forging the second signatory.

But her deceit started to unravel after a cheque of £20,000 from the church to the Diocese of Salisbury bounced due to a lack of funds in its bank account.

Two days before her death last year Mrs Gover was called to a meeting with vicar Rhona Floate to discuss the discrepancies.

On March 31 Mrs Gover's body was found by her husband in the woodshed on the grounds of their home in the hamlet of Moreton.

Detective Constable Richard Evans from Weymouth CID then investigated Mrs Gover's finances which revealed the full extent of the thefts.

He told the inquest she had been misappropriating church funds since 2008, had not presented financial statements to an independent auditor since 2009 and had forged the audit reports to the diocese to cover up her thefts.

His inquiries found Mrs Gover had also stolen at least £3,000 from the accounts of East Burton village hall in Wool which she was the treasurer of between January 2013 and March 2014.

Mrs Gover had also stolen £91,200 from the recipients of a trust fund she had been a book keeper for.

DC Evans told the inquest he discovered she wrote several fraudulent letters to Scottish Widows requesting sums from the trust account - five separate payments of between £5,000 and £30,000 over a seven-month period in 2012 to 2013 and then a final withdrawal of £1,200 in July 2013.

Mrs Gover had also agreed to a loan from the trust of £150,000 in 2010, which she said she would pay back over a ten-year period - but the hearing was told the majority of this remained unpaid.

Mr Gover said he was shocked at the information revealed at the inquest.

He said: 'I was completely unaware of what was going on. There's  bits and pieces we have been told today that have shocked me immensely. I'm lost for words.

'She was a wonderful, caring person. She was always there for people but sometimes she carried her life on her shoulders because she spent so much time doing things for others.'

In an interview with the police Mr Gover suggested that some of the money may have been used to prop up a hardware shop the couple ran which had been struggling.

Mr Gover also told officers that Mrs Gover was not depressed and her suicide was completely out of character.

He said he could only surmise that the financial situation got on top of her.

A month before her death Mrs Gover had consolidated her debts by arranging with a company to pay off £74,000 through monthly payments.

Her brother Robert Ewan said: 'She was a caring and loving sister, a friend to my wife and a doting aunt to my three children.

'After the death of our mother Jill took on the role of family matriarch and provided a home for our father in his old age at her house in Dorset.'

Deputy coroner Brendan Allen said although there was no suicide note he believed Mrs Gover intended to kill herself and recorded a verdict of suicide at the Bournemouth inquest.

Mr Allen said: 'Mrs Gover was a book-keeper for a number of different organisations and a trustee of a trust and seems to have used her roles to misappropriate funds.

'She was in significant debt and with what happened the preceding weekend and the bounced cheque becoming apparent on March 31, I take the view she intended to end her own life.'

Mrs Gover racked up debts of £225,000 which included a £112,000 mortgage on this Grade II listed cottage

The Bishop of Salisbury, the Rt Revd Nicholas Holtam, expressed his condolences to the family and urged anyone in a difficult financial situation to seek help.

He said: 'On behalf of the diocese, I express my deepest condolences to Martin and all of Jill's family and friends. 

'Now that the inquest has established the facts, I hope this grants people some measure of closure and allows the healing process to begin.

'I urge people to seek help if they are in a difficult situation, no matter how desperate it seems, no matter how much they feel they may have contributed to it.

'The first step to solving any problem is to talk to someone. There are always options and alternatives.' 

A memorial service for Mrs Gover was held at Holy Rood Curch three weeks after her death with donations going to the Donkey Sanctuary in Sidmouth, Devon.
