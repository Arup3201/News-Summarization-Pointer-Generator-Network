Hundreds of patients could suffer impaired vision after receiving eye surgery by a high street optician, experts fear.

Safety concerns have been raised over a type of replacement lens implanted in patients by Optical Express, the UK’s leading commercial eye surgery provider.

More than 6,500 British patients are thought to have received the Mplus X lens, manufactured by German company Oculentis, which went on sale just over a year ago.

Oculentis and Optical Express both deny any fault with the lens, which is used in a corrective procedure called refractive lens exchange to fix minor sight problems usually associated with age.

But leading eye surgeons have contacted the Medical Health Regulatory Authority after their patients complained of severe loss of vision after receiving the implant.

Moorfields Eye Hospital in London flagged the problem to the MHRA after two of its surgeons complained about the lens.

Charlie Jackson: Paid £4,200 for eye surgery

At 46, Charlie Jackson needed reading glasses for detailed work and had noticed his long vision was going.

Two minor operations later and he can barely see six inches in front of his face.

The company director, from Henley-on-Thames, went into an Optical Express branch in Reading to enquire about £700 laser eye surgery so he would no longer need glasses.

A short while later he had parted with £4,200, having been persuaded he needed to have the lenses in both eyes replaced with high-tech plastic discs. 

‘They really gave me the hard sell,’ Mr Jackson said. ‘They kept saying I would have “HD vision”.’

But he claims he can no longer focus on anything more than five inches away, requires bright lights in the house and struggles to see at night.

A spokesman for Optical Express said: ‘Mr Jackson is in the very early post-operative phase and with additional management his symptoms will subside and he will be able to fully enjoy his new vision without spectacles for distance or near vision.’

Nick Grant of law firm Devonshires, who is representing the patients, said he anticipated that he would reach 100 concerned patients very shortly.

There has been a sales culture at Optical Express where there has, on occasions, been a failure to properly explain the risks of surgery to patients.’

Private surgeon Sheraz Daya, who runs the Centre For Sight, called for far better regulation of High Street corrective eye clinics.

Mr Daya said: ‘The major problem here is that model of care is “pile them high, sell them cheap”. You have eye surgery being sold in heavily marketed, time-limited offers. These are complicated procedures, but they are being sold like they are TVs or second-hand cars.

‘The regulations are there but they are not being enforced.’

Sasha Rodoy, 61, who has been campaigning for better regulation of the corrective surgery industry, said: ‘The only reason anybody should have these operations is if it is the only option that will stop them going blind. They are just not safe.’

A spokesman for Moorfields Eye Hospital said: ‘Two surgeons had used these lenses in a very small number of patients, some of whom developed visual problems and required replacement of the lens.

‘Moorfields reported concerns with this particular make of lens via the MHRA’s yellow card scheme. Moorfields Eye Hospital no longer uses this lens.’

A spokesman for the MHRA said: ‘We are currently investigating and will take action if necessary. If patients have any questions they should speak to their optometrist or surgeon.’

A spokesman for Optical Express said: ‘Every lens type that we use has passed a rigorous and time-consuming evaluation to make sure that it is both safe and effective. 

Commercial eye clinics are regulated by the Care Quality Commission, but experts claim the organisation takes only a general overview.

Sheraz Daya, a leading eye surgeon, said tonight that the CQC should establish far stricter inspections and monitoring.

He also called for new guidelines limiting refractive lens exchange in commercial corrective sight procedures to people aged over 50. 

'This includes the MPlus X lens, which is being used here in the UK by many providers and around the world.

‘It is vitally important to stress that there have been no safety concerns whatsoever expressed about this lens. 

'A tiny minority of patients are reported to have experienced poorer than expected distance vision, but the overwhelming majority have had their sight and their life significantly improved by having this lens implanted.’ 

A spokesman for Oculentis confirmed the firm had received four ‘incident reports’ from the MHRA.

He added: ‘We are currently in the process of analysing the facts, as all of these reports are very unspecific and unsubstantiated, only basically mentioning poor distance vision as the main complaint.

‘The MplusX is considered to be one of the better balanced intraocular lenses available and is used by many renowned surgeons whose opinions are generally based on medical evidence. We believe very strongly in the concept and it is by no means a “faulty” model of lens.’
