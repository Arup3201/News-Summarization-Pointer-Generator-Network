Young people will struggle to find work unless employers are willing to offer them work experience, Esther McVey warns today.

The Employment Minister urged firms to follow the example of the TV show The Apprentice, where aspiring bosses of the future are put through their paces under the watchful gaze of Lord Sugar.

Miss McVey told MailOnline that employers should do everything they can to 'inspire the next generation' who will continue to lack the necessary skills without being given the chance to experience the world of work.

Employment minister Esther McVey told MailOnline employers should run Apprentice-style challenges to give young people experience of the world of work

Ministers fear that many young people face a vicious circle of being told they need to get more experience before they can land a job, but cannot get a job to get the experience.

Miss McVey claims shows like The Apprentice, where candidates gaining work experience by undertaking a series of tasks, can act as inspiration for employers to open their doors to young people trying to enter the jobs market.

More than a quarter of a million young people have taken part in employer-led placements or work experience through Jobcentre Plus since January 2011, according to the Department for Work and Pensions.

Miss McVey said: 'It's the age old problem – the young people I meet tell me they need work experience to get a job, but they need a job to get work experience.

'That's why we hugely increased the number of work experience placements available and why our advisers in Jobcentre Plus work closely with local businesses to provide tailored training opportunities for young jobseekers across the UK. Work experience works.'

Latest figures show that in the three months to July, 16.6 per cent of 16-24-year-olds were unemployed, down from 21 per cent a year earlier, but still higher than the 13.8 per cent seen in early 2008. Overall, 747,000 people aged 16-24 are unemployed people.

Miss McVey suggested successful businesses had a key part to play in getting them into work.

She said: 'People who have been successful in business have a huge amount to offer young people who are just starting out.

'They know about the drive and determination it takes to work your way up through the ranks, or to set up in business and go it alone.

'This kind of first hand experience can be invaluable in inspiring our young people to work hard and build a career.

'I'd like to appeal to bosses around the country to do everything they can to inspire the next generation.

'Our young people are some of the best and most talented in the world - they are driven, entrepreneurial and innovative, and with the help of people who have already made it in the world of work, they can go on to be the bosses and employers of the future.

'As the new series of the Apprentice starts I'd encourage a generation of young people to consider getting work experience and support from us to make their dream of being their own boss become a reality.'

In the show, over-ambitious would-be bosses are put through a series of tests, which Miss McVey argues are a good way of showing young people the realities of running a business

However, last year Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said The Apprentice should change its name because the bizarre challenges and on-the-spot sackings could put people off starting apprenticeships. 

'I know that The Apprentice is designed to be dramatic television viewing but it has very little to do with apprentices – people who are doing a serious piece of vocational training,' he said. 

'I worry that whatever the attractions of the programme as a piece of TV theatre, it gives people a completely false impression about what being an apprentice actually involves.' 

The Apprentice returns to BBC One on Tuesday night at 9pm.
