Burnley boss Sean Dyche has jumped to the defence of Ashley Barnes following an outspoken attack on the striker by Chelsea counterpart Jose Mourinho.

Following the heated 1-1 draw between the sides at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, Mourinho accused Barnes of making a 'criminal' tackle on Nemanja Matic which saw the Clarets man escape punishment and the Blues midfielder sent off for retaliating.

A furious Mourinho had described Barnes' challenge on Matic, when he followed through after making a pass to connect with his shin, as potentially career-ending and said the ex-Brighton man had 'a grey past'.

He also hit out at Barnes for an apparent kick on Branislav Ivanovic as the pair challenged for a high ball.

But in a 10-minute video analysis, Dyche has questioned Mourinho's take on the incidents.

With regards to the coming together with Matic, Dyche said: 'On slow mo(tion) of course it looks ugly but there was contact with the ball (from Barnes). I would suggest once you are in that pendulum motion to play a pass it is very difficult to then retract your leg immediately and stop your leg from going through that ball and rising.

'I must make it clear when you see it in slow mo it does not look pleasant,' he added.

'I find it hard to believe, however, that all these people - especially the manager - using very strong phrases didn't have any reaction at all at that live moment. I find that a hard one to accept. We can all use slow mo, things often look different.'

The Burnley boss pointed out that, at the time, none of the Chelsea players, except for Matic, reacted to the challenge. Videos show John Terry turning away from the incident, Branislav Ivanovic appealing for a throw-in, while Jose Mourinho stands calmly on the touchline.

'The likes of John Terry, a real warrior and a top class professional in my opinion, Zouma, big strong boys, Ivanovic, right on top of this moment. 

'Jose Mourinho, similar view to me, the crowd behind me, circa 15,000 fans. No one reacts. Apart from Matic.'

Mourinho also said Barnes should not have been on the field following the aerial challenge with Ivanovic in which he appeared to lead with his feet.

Dyche criticised Mourinho, who he claims didn't react to the tackle at the time, before becoming angry later

Jose Mourinho described the tackle as 'criminal' during his appearance on Goals on Sunday on Sky Sports

'They felt that player should not be on the field of play,' said Dyche.

'It looks like's he's running across to make a challenge. I can't imagine it to be deemed anything more than at most a yellow card. Worst case scenario would be a yellow card - almost impossible to be a red card.'

Barnes will not be given any retrospective punishment for the clash with Matic as the referee was deemed to have seen the offence.

'This can be end of career, Matic is a very lucky guy,' Mourinho had said. 'I can't find the word to describe what that player [Barnes] did.

The Chelsea manager felt the tackle could have broken his player's leg, and has appealed the red card

'I can clearly understand that football is about emotions and sometimes you lose emotions. Clearly Matic had a reason to lose his emotions.

'What could be the consequence of his push for the other player? Nothing. The consequence for Matic could be end of career. If you call Diego Costa's actions against Liverpool a crime, the minimum you have to say is this is a criminal tackle.'

In a colourful yet controlled rant on Sky's Goals on Sunday, Mourinho added: 'This Burnley player involved in two actions has a grey past. There was a very dark point in his career when he was at Brighton and suspended for seven matches, because of a big incident with a referee.'

30 - Ashley Barnes sends Branislav Ivanovic crashing to the ground in an aerial challenge after a knee in the back. Ivanovic rolls over twice before leaping up in anger when he realises no action is being taken. 

Dyche's Verdict: 'I can't imagine it to be deemed anything more than at most a yellow card. Worst case scenario would be a yellow card - almost impossible to be a red card.'

33 - Ivanovic fires a shot at goal but Michael Kightly diverts it with an outstretched arm, as he turns his back to goal. Martin Atkinson waves play on. 

Dyche's Verdict: 'The thing that wasn't picked up is that it actually hits him on his thigh first. It cannons off his thigh onto his arm. That being said usually you would expect that to be given.'

43 - Diego Costa tumbles to the ground after Burnley captain Jason Shackell leans into him with an oustretched arm. Atkinson waves play on. 

Dyche's Verdict: 'I think that's one where you're damned if you do, damned if you don't as a referee. 

He cuts in, Jason Shackell definitely gets a mild hand on him. Is that enough for him to go down? It's a real debate point. I think it's a close one. 

If it goes against you, you can understand it, if it goes with you, you can understand it.'

69 - Barnes misses the ball and almost snaps Nemanja Matic's left shin with his studs but Atkinson waves play on. An enraged Matic leaps up and pushes Barnes over violently. Atkinson sends off Matic and books Ivanovic for trying to take red card out of his hand. 

Dyche's Verdict: 'My instant impression was of a coming together at an unusual angle. In live time, no-one reacts.

'After the event when you've had slow-mo, every angle, change, it looks an ugly challenge, but the ball is still made contact with. The motion of the player is at high speed. 

'When you see it, after the event, of course it doesn't look a pleasant challenge. BUt at live speed, these are expert people who have been in the game a long time, don't react, don't even flinch at that moment.
