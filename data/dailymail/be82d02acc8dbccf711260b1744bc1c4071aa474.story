The Roy Keane effect produced instant dividends for Aston Villa as they sprung a surprise victory at The Britannia with a well-taken goal by Andreas Weimann.

Keane, making his bow as Paul Lambert’s assistant, heard his name chanted by Villa fans as Weimann’s 50th-minute winner exposed some uncharacteristic hesitation in the home defence.

With both teams parading three signings apiece, there was plenty of optimism around at The Britannia at kick-off time.

Particular enthusiasm was shown towards Bojan Krkic, the Barca boy who has ended up at Stoke.

He showed dazzling feet early on before sending a shot into the side-netting as home fans warmed to the football manager Mark Hughes is trying to play.

Stoke had the best of the early action with Villa prepared to put their foot in when necessary.

Steven Nzonzi was painfully caught on the foot by Ashley Westwood and Villa hard-man Alan Hutton, in his first Premier League outing for 27 months, unceremoniously dumped one of City’s debutants Biram Mame Diouf on the turf.

Villa gradually emerged from their early attacking slumber and should have nicked the first goal after 14 minutes.

Asmir Begovic and Erik Pieters left the ball to each other on the edge of the penalty area and Kieran Richardson nipped in to square for Gaby Agbonlahor.

The striker should have buried the chance from six yards but mis-hit wide. He was so embarrassed he vainly claimed his muffed shot had taken a deflection and he should have a corner.

Agbonlahor has pace and energy but went into yesterday having scored only one goal in 14 games.

Villa were encouraged though and Stoke needed their skipper Ryan Shawcross to be at his best. He blocked everything thrown at him, standing up tall to bravely get in the way of a shot Aly Cissokho.

When Shawcross was breached, Begovic saves with his legs from N’Zogbia.

At the other end, a late Stoke rally before half-time saw Brad Guzan spill a shot by Phil Bardsley and was relieved Philippe Senderos managed to hack the ball away before Bojan arrived for the rebound.

Within five minutes of the re-start, Villa were ahead. Andreas Weimann scored well but in the Stoke dug-out Hughes would have been furious about how cheaply it was given away.

N’Zogbia threatened danger with a neat turn on the edge of the box but when Wilson blocked Weimann’s shot on the edge of the area, the danger should have been cleared.

Instead, Wilson and Stephen Ireland hesitated as if expecting each other to make the clearance or Shawcross to come across. Weimann didn’t and belted a right-foot shot that seemed to go through Begovic due to its power, though the goalkeeper will be disappointed not to have got some kind of decisive block.

Villa’s Austrian forward celebrated enthusiastically in front of the travelling fans with good reason. He only scored once away from Villa Park throughout the whole of last season. 

The goal knocked the stuffing out Stoke, who had confirmed the loan signing of Chelsea’s Victor Moses earlier in the day.

Their defender Erik Pieters ran into Weimann and fell over claiming a penalty, which was correctly dismissed by referee Anthony Taylor. Ron Vlaar went close to scoring a second with a header from a corner, and got a bloody nose as a result after accidentally banging into N’Zogbia.

Stoke sent on big Peter Crouch for the last 20 but rarely threatened an equaliser. Indeed, it was Villa youngster Jack Grealish who set up fellow sub Leandro Bacuna with a chance he hit wide. Stoke's only serious glimmer came in injury-time when Senderos made a late block.

A tracksuited Keane kept popping out it in the second half, even choosing to exchange words with the fourth official over his award of a Stoke free-kick.

At least the result and performance of Villa’s players should ensure they will escape the Keano glare in the next few days.
