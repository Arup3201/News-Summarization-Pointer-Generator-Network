A man has been arrested for kidnapping and sexual assaulting a 14-year-old Texas girl who was trick-or-treating with her friends on Halloween, while his alleged accomplice is still at large.

Eric Bonilla, 23, was arrested on November 1, the day after Halloween, for abducting the young girl allegedly with the help of another man, Daryl Wayne Mayberry, 28.

The men allegedly lured the young girl into their truck at the intersection of Las Cruces Avenue and Oak Knoll Lane in Houston, Texas, while she was trick-or-treating

Charged: Eric Bonilla, 23, left, has been arrested for kidnapping the 14-year-old girl with the help of Daryl Wayne Mayberry, 28, right, on Halloween

They were driving a red Chevrolet Avalanche and the girl noticed that one of the men was holding what appeared to be a taser gun, according to the Houston Chronicle.

The two men drove her to a nearby park where Bonilla sexually assaulted her while Mayberry acted as a lookout, according to Harris County court documents.

Documents state the girl was held by the pair for 10 hours before she was released in the early morning hours of November 1, after which she walked to her school where she was reunited with her parents.

The girl told her parents what had happened and they began driving around their neighborhood looking for the truck she described.

They found a truck matching her description and called police.Â 

A 10-hour ordeal: The two suspects took the girl to this house at 8930 Laura Koppe, East Houston, where they kept her hostage for 10 hours. She was abducted in the red Chevrolet Avalanche driven by the men

Houston police say they found a police-type jacket and police patches in the vehicle, along with a white towel and pepper spray.

Bonilla initially denied having any sexual contact with the girl, but did say they had picked her up.

During interrogation he later admitted to having sexual intercourse with the girl and police say he provided information to identify Mayberry.

Bonilla is being held on a $30,000 bond and an arrest warrant has been issued for Mayberry, who is charged with aggravated kidnapping.

Bonilla has been charged with aggravated kidnapping and sexual assault of a child.
