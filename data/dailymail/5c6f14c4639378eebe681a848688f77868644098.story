Tinder is set to launch its much awaited 'Tinder Plus' app allowing users to 'undo' accidental deletes in the US within weeks.

The service has already been tested in the UK, but is now about to launch in the US, according to Techcrunch - with an expected price of $6.99 per month.

The paid update is expected to allow allow users to search in other locations, although they may be charged extra for this.

Tinder (screenshots pictured) is rolling out an 'undo' button which will let users undo swipes - letting them revisit profiles that they may have accidentally rejected. The function is due to be rolled out in the UK and elsewhere, but will require a premium subscription to Tinder Plus, which could cost up to $20 (£12.50) a month

Tinder Plus will be the premium version of the free Tinder dating app. 

Tinder Plus will include an 'undo' button which will let its users undo their swipes - meaning they can revisit profiles they may have been too hasty to dismiss and swipe left.

A 'Passport' button will also allow users to search for dates in extra locations.

Currently, the app automatically searches within a certain distance from a user’s location, whereas Tinder Plus users will be able to toggle between different locations.

'Both of Tinder’s mobile apps recently received updates on the respective app stores where the feature was mentioned in the app’s update text – hinting at an imminent arrival,' Techcrunch said.

'However, Tinder says that Plus is not yet being enabled for end users in the U.S. at this time – and the app’s update text descriptions will be edited to reflect this.

'Instead, the dating service says its U.S. launch is still on track for a mid-to-late March time frame.' 

The current version of the free dating app allows users looking for love to swipe right to ‘like’ someone and left to pass. 

If both users like each other, they can chat and share photos with each other.

Tinder sees more than 850 million swipes and more than 10 million matches made every single day, with 2 billion matches made to date - but so far has not monetised its app. 

A new version of the app will display a big yellow ‘undo’ button on the home screen, which members of Tinder Plus will be able to use, but regular users of the free version of the app will be able to see – in a bid to lure them into paying for the service.

The app also plans on launching a button on its home screen called Passport, which will let users search for potential dates in extra locations.

Currently, the app automatically searches within a certain distance from a user’s location, whereas Tinder Plus users will be able to toggle between different locations.

The new feature could offer restaurant and sightseeing recommendations in a variety of locations.

While this feature may well be used by well-travelled bachelors to plan holiday hook-ups, the company hopes it will be useful to people who travel frequently for work and hope to meet the love of their life.

CEO and President of Tinder, Sean Rad (who will be leaving the firm as CEO) told TechCrunch: ‘The most-requested feature we get is a button to go back and have a second chance with people that users swipe left on.’ 

Mr Rad said: ‘We often hear that people want to be able to start swiping in a location before they’ve left to go on a trip or vacation…We also hear people saying that they want to get recommendations for places to go and where to eat in a new city and Tinder Plus can do better at that.’

There is no date when Tinder Plus will launch in the UK and the trial will only be available to around 40 per cent of users in the first instance.

Tinder says this is because it is testing different prices to see whether 99cents (62p), $4.99 (£3.10), $9.99 (£6.30), or $19.99 (£12.50) will be the best fit for consumers.

‘We want to find that sweet spot that most users can agree on,’ Rad said.
