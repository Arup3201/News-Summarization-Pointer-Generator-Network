Gisele Bundchen has topped Forbes' list of highest-paid models for the eighth year running.

The Brazilian beauty, 34, has earned $47million over the past year - $16million more than her New England Patriots quarterback husband, Tom Brady.

The mother-of-two's impressive pre-tax earnings were credited to high-profile modelling campaigns for H&M, Chanel, and Carolina Herrera, as well as her work as the U.S. face of Pantene and the face of Oral-B in Brazil.

The face of fortune: Gisele Bundchen has topped Forbes' list of highest-paid models for the eighth year running - out-earning her NFL quarterback husband Tom Brady by $16million

Gisele's commercial savvy has also seen her profit from her partnerships with Brazilian shoemaker Grendene and a lingerie collection with Brazilian intimates firm, Hope.

Forbes estimates that contrary to Linda Evangelista's famous statement that she wouldn't get out of bed for less than $10,000 a day, Gisele does not get out of bed for less than $128,000 a day.

The title estimates that she has earned a staggering $386million from modeling since 2001.

 And Gisele far out-earns her fellow models. She made over five times more than Doutzen Kroes, 29, and Adriana Lima, 33, who came in joint second place on the list with past year earnings of $8million each.

This year saw Sports Illustrated cover girl Kate Upton, 22, make her first appearance on the list, with earnings of $7million in the past year.

She matched those of British beauty Kate Moss, 40, Australian supermodel Miranda Kerr, 31 and dimpled Chinese catwalk regular Liu Wen, 26.

Victoria's Secret Angels dominated the rest of the list: Alessandra Ambrosio ($5m), Karlie Kloss ($4m), Candice Swanepoel ($3m) and Erin Heatherton ($3m).

This month's Vanity Fair cover girl and mother-of-four Natalia Vodianova managed to make $4million last year - despite being pregnant for much of it.

And Cara Delevingne, whose face seems to have been everywhere this past year, ranked among the high-earners with $3.5million.
