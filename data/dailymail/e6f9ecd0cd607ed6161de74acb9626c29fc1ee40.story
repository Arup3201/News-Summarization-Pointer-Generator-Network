Filmmaker Boris von Schoenebeck became more and more confident in the company of two cheetahs who had made a habit of climbing on his jeep while he filmed in the wilds of the Serengeti in Tanzania. 

But one day he got a little too close, and the young male of the pair let him him know with a gentle swipe with his right paw. 

Thankfully for 47-year-old German Boris, the cheetah's strike wasn't the kind it would usually reserve for prey, and when he locked his jaws on something it was his GoPro camera rather than him.

 In the process of filming cheetahs for a documentary, a mature female and the young male had become increasingly comfortable with Von Schoenebeck and his assistant, so much so they had become regular visitors to their vehicle.

'Almost every day we would come across these two cheetahs who would climb on top of our vehicle,' he said.

'They use our vehicle as a place of higher ground.'

As the weeks went on I edged further and further out of the vehicle and we actually discovered that the cheetahs weren't that interested in us.

'At one point I got a little bit close to the male on the top of the roof and he took a swipe at the GoPro, and then he proceeded to chew on it.

Von Schoenebeck, who's spent most of his life in South Africa, said the cheetahs' presence on his vehicle eventually attracted safari guests.

'Tourists would often see us and within five minutes we would have 20 vehicles around us and we would have to stop filming - suddenly we would become the viewing point,' he said. 

With such interest not conducive to filming his documentary about the world's fastest land animal, he took the chance to become more familiar with the cats.

'It was just amazing to be able to get so close to two cheetahs, and for them to be so comfortable with us,' he explains. 'Normally we're looking at them 300m away.'

After the male cheetah got its nashers into his GoPro, one of many photographic devices at his disposal, Boris didn't seem too bothered. 

Though he did admit: 'Maybe we need a new lens.'

Danger is no stranger to Von Schoenebeck, whose previous feature film Black Mamba Kiss of Death concentrated on the lives of the deadly snake that can deliver enough  neurotoxins in a single bite to kill 15 men.
