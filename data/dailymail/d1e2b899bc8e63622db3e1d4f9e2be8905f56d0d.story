They were once vital industrial routes used to supply coal to Britain's biggest mines and home to hundreds of workers.

But now relegated to leisure use, a unique collection of photos of Britain's canals give a rare insight into lives of the last generation to work the inland waterways.Â 

The new exhibition, An Inland Voyage, at the London Canal Museum includes pictures from the late 1940s and early 1950s before the use of the waterways changed forever.

The pictures by Coventry factory worker turned photographer Robert Longden taken at Hawkesbury Junction in Warwickshire, where the Oxford and Coventry canals meet, have been restored and curated by his great grandson Stephen Pochin.

His unique photographic archive conveys an intimate social history of a working life now long gone.

In the late 1940s, the area around Hawkesbury was dominated by heavy industry with six massive cooling towers visible along the skyline.

Working life: The Oxford canal was the main coal supply route from Wyken Colliery and pit heads in the area

The Oxford canal provided the main coal supply route to London from Wyken Colliery and nearby pit heads around Hawkesbury Village and Exhall.

Longden became president of the Coventry Photographic Society and won several awards for his work.

Today, his archive is considered to be of unique social and historical importance.

The exhibition runs until February next year.
