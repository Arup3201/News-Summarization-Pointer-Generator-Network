Sitting with their trousers rolled up and their legs dangling in the US Capitol Reflecting Pool, these pictures show TV personality Stephen Colbert enjoying a spot of fishing with Republican Jack Kingston.

Colbert, host of the Comedy Central 'The Colbert Report' and Congressman Kingston, were photographed sporting straw hats and reeling in fish from the famous lake.  

Later on, Colbert was filmed stealing a bust of Abraham Lincoln from a congressman's office before escaping in a roll-away dustbin.

During the video for the show, Colbert was aided by Kingston, the outgoing Congressman, who then ran out of the office together.

The pair were filmed for Colbert's Comedy Central show 'The Colbert Report' on Friday 

With their trousers rolled up and dangling their feet in the lake, the pair were watched by excited onlookers

It was announced earlier this year that Colbert will take over from David Letterman as host of CBS' Late Show

Recently, it was announced that Colbert will replace David Letterman as host of CBS' Late Show.

The TV host was catapulted to fame after a video of him making a controversial speech at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner in 2006 went viral.

Standing a few yards from then US President George Bush, he mockingly said: 'I stand by this man. 

'I stand by this man because he stands for things. Not only for things, he stands on things. Things like aircraft carriers and rubble and recently flooded city squares. 

'And that sends a strong message, that no matter what happens to America, she will always rebound - with the most powerfully staged photo ops in the world.'

Kingston is the US Representative for Georgia's 1st congressional district in Southeast Georgia, which he has served since 1993.

This year, he unsuccessfully ran for the US Senate seat, currently occupied by retiring Senator Saxby Chambliss, when he lost to David Perdue. 

The youngest of 11 siblings in a family of intellectuals, Stephen Colbert's ability to make himself heard appears to have been ingrained from birth.

He was raised Catholic in Charleston, South Carolina, by his doctor-Yale professor father James and homemaker mother Lorna. Colbert has said in past interviews that although he was raised in a devout family, his intellectual parents taught him to be questioning of the Church, a theme which continues to run through his comic routines.

In 1974, when he was ten, Stephen's father and two of his brothers Peter and Paul were killed in a plane crash in North Carolina. The tragedy and the family's subsequent move to an urban area of Charleston, led to him becoming an introverted teenager with few friends who relied on the worlds of science-fiction and fantasy.

Colbert credits his love of the role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons for sparking an early interest in acting.

By his own admission a slacker in the academic department, he swayed over whether he would attend college. 

He had a brief stint in a Rolling Stones cover band and saw his dreams of becoming a marine biologist shattered after surgery left him deaf in his right ear. 

He studied philosophy at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia then transferred to Northwestern as a theatre major. After college, he wound up in an improvised comedy troupe in Chicago where he understudied Steve Carrell and met Amy Sedaris and Paul Dinello. The trio were offered the chance to do an HBO series which earned positive reviews. 

The opportunity led to brief writing stints for SNL, MTV and GMA, before he was hired on a trial basis for the Daily Show in 1997.

Colbert satirized a news correspondent with little more than a basic grip of the subject he was discussing. His writing on the Daily Show earned him three Emmys.

In 2005, his news satire spin-off The Colbert Report launched on Comedy Central. It started with high-ratings and has held its place as one of the network's most-watched shows.

On April 10, it was announced that Colbert would be filling the shoes of David Letterman on The Late Show.

He lives in Montclair, New Jersey with his wife Evelyn and three children Madeleine, Peter and John.
