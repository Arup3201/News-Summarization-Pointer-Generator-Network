Scores of civilians, many of them women with screaming children clinging to their necks, crossed a narrow river marking the border with Turkey as shelling on a Syrian town intensified yesterday.

The U.S has responded to the escalating violence between Syria and Turkey by sending a 150 strong specialist task force to its ally Jordan, after concerns that the violence might spread across the southern border as well as in the north.

The news comes after the UN reported that 335,000 Syrian refugees have registered with the organisation, an increase by ten times since March.

It came as Turkey scrambled fighter planes to 
force a Syrian passenger jet to land and seized what it suspected was 
military equipment being ferried from Russia to Syrian President Bashar 
al-Assad's forces.

The 
interception of the Syrian Air plane late yesterday happened soon after Turkey's chief of 
staff warned that his troops would respond with greater force if shells 
from Syria continued to hit Turkish territory.

Men, women and children crossed the narrow Orontes river which marks the 
Syrian-Turkish border near the village of Hacipasa in Hatay province.

Villagers helped the families by ferrying them in small metal boats as they fled the violence in the Syrian border town of Azmarin where several mortar shells landed early on Wednesday.

As heavy machine gun fire could be heard from the Turkish side, smoke rose into the sky and cries of 'God is greatest' rang out between the bursts of gunfire, a witness said.

'The firing started getting intense 
last night. Some people have been killed, some are lying wounded on the 
road,' said Mune, a 55-year-old woman who crossed the river to Hacipasa.

'People want to escape but they can't. Many have settled in a field outside the town and are trying to come,' she said.

Ambulances and medical aid waited on the Turkish side of Orontes, taking wounded to the main city of Antakya or district hospitals.

'Don't take me across, take me back. I
want to return and fight,' said one man in a blood-stained shirt, being
carried from the river on a stretcher.

The news of shelling on Azmarin came just before Turkey's military chief of staff said that Turkey 
will respond with greater force if Syrian fire continues to hit 
its territory.

After several attacks from their neighbour, Turkish military forces have responded across the border to
northern Syria, where President Bashar al-Assad's forces have been 
battling rebels.

‘We responded but if it continues we 
will respond with greater force,’ Turkey's Chief of Staff, General 
Necdet Ozel, told state television TRT.

It is not clear whether the shells 
that have hit Turkish territory in the past week have been aimed towards the nation or if Syrian troops have made mistakes when attacking rebel 
positions.

NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh 
Rasmussen said on Tuesday the military alliance had plans in 
place to defend Turkey. He gave no further details, but a senior U.S. 
defense official said NATO would likely react if Turkey made a request 
for assistance.

Jordan and other neighbouring countries 
are increasingly worried that the violence will spill over to countries south of Syria.

The 150 troops sent by the U.S. to 
Jordan are intended to provide support to the American ally as they deal with the increasing influx of Syrian refugees.

The specialist task force is also 
preparing to move in to help secure the Syrian regime’s chemical weapons
should President al-Assad lose control over these.

The U.S. force is stationed about 35 
miles from the border and officials told the New York Times that there has been
talks of a buffer zone in Syria where Jordanian troops would operate 
with U.S. military as logistical support.

The number of refugees registered with the United 
Nations has drastically increased, reaching 335,000. However the real 
figure could be as high as 500,000, a U.N. refugee agency official said 
yesterday.

The UNHCR said last month that up to 
700,000 refugees may flee the violence in Syria by the end of the year, 
four times higher than its June prediction.

Most of those fleeing are taking refuge in neighbouring Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey.

The sharp rise in casualties and 
refugees indicates the growing intensity of the conflict, which 
developed from peaceful protests against Assad in March 2011 into a 
full-scale civil war.

An estimated 30,000 people have been killed as main cities such as Aleppo, Homs and the capital Damascus are savagely contested.

Taking charge: Syrian President Bashir al-Assad

After a wave of defections and rebel attacks on strategic government targets, President Bashir al-Assad has assumed personal command of his forces, still convinced he can win through numbers.

A picture posted on his Facebook page shows the the 47-year-old dressed in full military regalia, summing up his transformation since the July bomb attack which killed his inner circle security leadership, including his brother-in-law and defence minister.

Recent visitors say it strengthened President Assad’s conviction and he has now taken full responsibility for the day-to-day leadership.

‘He is no longer a president who depends on his team and directs through his aides.

'This is a fundamental change in Assad's thinking,’ said a pro-Syrian Lebanese politician close to Assad. ‘Now he is involved in directing the battle.’

'The fighting nerve is steady. The Iranians and the Russians may have helped them. Their ability to manage daily and control the situation has improved.’

It is a self-confident leader who has ordered his military to focus on the capital of Damascus and the second largest city of Aleppo, which has seen a majority of the conflict.

However, observers say Assad’s victimisation of the regime is ludicrous and that he is deluded if he thinks he can win.

‘The problem is the regime lives in its own world. It is clear the people are rejecting this idea that it is a secular regime set upon by extremists,’ a Western diplomat said.

‘Bashar is not the victim. He is the cause of the violence.’

Other observers of the escalating conflict say the question may no longer be one of Assad’s presidency, but of the existence of Syria as a nation.

‘Everybody is kind of hypnotised by the issue of whether Bashar is president or not, whether he is leaving or not,’ said one Arab official.

‘I fear the problem is much bigger than that. The problem is to see how Syria is going to survive, how the new Syria is going to be born.’

A factor which has helped Assad to hold on to power is the failure of the rebel forces to unite under one command.

Religious and ideological disagreements among rebels have led to clashes as they fail to find common ground on issues other than the ousting of President Assad.

The rebel forces have failed to keep control of their claimed territories under attacks from the government and in the frustration have switched tactics to suicide bombings and hit-and-run attacks.

‘Militarily the regime is more relaxed but from a security position the country is falling apart,’ said the pro-Syrian Lebanese politician.

‘An explosion might happen anywhere, an assassination might happen, the situation is chaotic and out of control.’

He added that the following months will be crucial to the war as the satiation depends on Russian support, the American election and the situation in neighbouring Iran.
