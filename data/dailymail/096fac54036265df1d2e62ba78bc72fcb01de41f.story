Booking photos show a smirking Eagan appearing unfazed by the accusations, which do not specify the student's age but are based on Eagan's position of authority over the victim.

Police declined to release the student's age.

Eagan is due to return to court February 25.

She has been placed on administrative leave pending an internal investigation at her school, reports the Hartford Courant.
