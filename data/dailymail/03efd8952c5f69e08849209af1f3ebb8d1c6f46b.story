Shocking footage has emerged of a young partygoer who was allegedly set alight after being sprayed with flammable liquids.

The footage, which was recorded through the sharing app Snapchat, shows the 18-year-old man without his pants on as his friend lit his leg on fire at a party in Collaroy Plateau in northern Sydney.

As the group giggled in the background, a second friend is seen leaning in as he sprayed the young man's leg with aerosol.

Shocking footage has emerged of a young partygoer who was set alight after being doused with aerosol

He sustained 'superficial but excessive burns to his back' after the fire quickly spread up his leg when he was with friends at a home on Essilia Street about 12.20am on Sunday.

It was alleged that the prank was consensual after he agreed to be set alight but moments later, friends desperately called for help.

The man was taken by ambulance to Royal North Shore Hospital and remains in a stable condition.

Another 18-year-old man who was arrested at the scene and taken to Dee Why Police Station to assist police with their inquiries, has been released.

A NSW police spokesman told Daily Mail Australia they could not comment further on the incident as to how the young man sustained severe burns but an investigation is underway.

'Nothing further at this stage but police are continuing to investigate the incident,' a police spokesman said.
