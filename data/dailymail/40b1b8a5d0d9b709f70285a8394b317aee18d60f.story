A health and safety executive who crashed into a teenage girl on a moped and left her to be run over and killed by a minibus was today jailed for six years.

Brian Hampton was serving a ban for drink-driving when he smashed his £40,000 Volvo XC90 4X4 into the back of Jade Clark’s scooter.

The former paramedic swerved around Jade as she was thrown into the carriageway and carried on without stopping.

Road death: Jade Clark. 16, was killed after 
Brian Hampton, sketched in court, hit her with his 4X4 before she was 
run over and killed by a minibus, a court heard

Moments later an oncoming minibus run over the trainee hairdresser, killing her instantly.

Hampton, 58, was caught on a hotel security camera inspecting the damage to the front of his silver Volvo the morning after the horrific crash.

He went on to spin a web of lies to the police and his wife, claiming he had run over a pot hole or hit a deer, and paid £4,300 to get the damage hastily repaired.

He had previously admitted a charge of causing death by careless driving and was jailed for two years.

He was found guilty of perverting the course of justice by trying to cover it up, for which he was jailed for four years. The sentences are to run consecutively.

In a victim impact statement read out on her behalf, Jade’s mum Sharon said she has nightmares of her daughter lying in the road calling for her mother and that she still blames herself for buying Jade the scooter.

She said: 'It is almost unbearable and I hope she didn’t suffer. No punishment will be suitable and none will bring Jade back.'

In
sentencing Hampton at Bournemouth Crown Court Judge Samuel Wiggs told 
him: 'You have shown yourself to be a consistent liar as much as you 
were a consistent driver even after your disqualification.

'By
your own behaviour you have caused devastation to many people. You have
devastated the immediate family and other friends and relatives as 
well.'

Earlier today a 
shocked jury at Bournemouth Crown Court were shown the footage this 
morning in which Hampton is seen examining the £40,000 4X4’s broken 
front grill and then spending five minutes trying to get its bonnet 
open.

Debris: The shattered remains of Jade's moped after a crash the prosecution say was caused by Hampton who then fled

The previous evening Hampton, a 
railway health and safety executive, slammed into the back of Jade’s 
moped, sending her flying into the carriageway the court was told

The trainee hairdresser, who had been on her way to a friend's party was then hit by an oncoming minibus and died instantly from severe head injuries.

The prosecution told the court how Jade Clark's scooter was 'swallowed up
and fragmented into hundreds of pieces' by Hampton's Volvo 4X4 
after he ploughed into the back of it.

But Hampton,
58, who was serving a drink-driving ban at the time, 
swerved around her before speeding off without stopping.

The court heard Hampton struck Jade's scooter as he drove along the A31 in Ringwood, Hampshire, on February 24.

But his wife Maureen took to the witness stand to tell jurors she had no idea her husband had been banned from driving for 26 months after a drink drive conviction at the time of the accident.

Following Hampton’s arrest on March 21 this year he wrote a letter to her explaining he had been too scared to tell her he had been disqualified.

He wrote: 'I swear with all my heart I did not hit that poor girl on the scooter.'

Simon Jones, prosecuting, said: 'Jade fell into the middle of the carriageway and the defendant swerved around her. That left her exposed to the fast moving traffic.

'Her moped was swallowed up and pushed along the carriageway.'

Mr Jones said motorist John Ward was driving a VW minibus and had no time to react before hitting Jade, a trainee hairdresser from Ringwood in the New Forest.

He added: 'He drove over what he initially believed to be debris and caused catastrophic head injuries and instant death.

'The moped was fragmented into hundreds of pieces.

'Brian Hampton had already driven off effectively leaving Jade and the scene of a fatal road collision.

Case: Brian Hampton is on trial for perverting the course of justice after allegedly lying to cover up his part in the crash

'It was his duty to stop.

'What
the defendant did was to seek to evade justice and pervert the course 
of justice by arranging for the damage to his vehicle to be subsequently
repaired.

'He did this 
with one purpose in mind - that being to ensure there could be no link 
between him, his vehicle and the collision that occurred on the A31 that
day.'

Hampton drove his damaged vehicle to the Premier Inn in Poole where he had been booked in by his employers, railway company Signalling Solutions, the court heard.

He emailed his manager at 4am the following day saying he couldn't attend work because he had swollen feet.

He then told his wife Maureen that his car had broken down and he had to wait several days for a recovery truck to tow it back to his home in Kent, it is alleged.

But later that day he secretly drove to Ashford near his home town of Shadoxhurst where he took his car to a garage then stayed in a nearby Holiday Inn for two nights, the jury heard.

Mechanics replaced the car's bonnet, grill, radiator, sump shield, bumper and number plate but raised concerns because there had been no blood or fur on the car.

When officers swooped on his home on March 21, Hampton told them he had no idea why he was being arrested.

The court heard he told officers he had not seen or been involved in an incident, then later admitted he had seen a crash but had not been involved.

He also denied getting his car repaired then later conceded he had.

During a police interview he said: 'I have told you lots of porkies but one thing I did not tell porkies about was I did not hit that young lady.'

Mr Jones said a series of CCTV images of Hampton's car prior to the incident showed the grill trim in tact, while photos taken after showed it to be broken following a collision.

Hampton was also caught on camera checking the front of his vehicle at the Premier Inn in Poole, and told staff when he left that he couldn't get the bonnet open.

Mr Jones said: 'There can be no other credible explanation for the repair other than for this defendant to distance himself from the collision and subsequent detection of his involvement.'

PC Clifton Beard, a crash investigator, told the court Jade’s scooter had been wedged into the front of Hampton’s car and pushed up to 70ft.

He said: 'Although we are not talking about a massive impact, we are still talking about a forceful impact. That would have sent a significant jolt through the Volvo.'
