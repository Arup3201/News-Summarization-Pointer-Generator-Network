Martin Skrtel's defending may have been questionable during Liverpool's game against Arsenal, but his bravery certainly wasn't.

The Slovakian, who was beaten in the air by Arsenal's makeshift centre back for the Gunners' equaliser, was on the wrong end of Olivier Giroud's boot early in the second half.

Skrtel needed lengthy treatment on the pitch, but, after being bandaged up by his club's medical staff, decided to carry on.
