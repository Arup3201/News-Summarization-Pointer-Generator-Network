Scientists have come up with a way of adding texture to touch screen computers so users can feel what they see.

Researchers have written an algorithm for 2D touchscreens that modifies the friction between a user's finger and the screen to add physical sensations to what a viewer is looking at.

The discovery could lead to textured maps where users can feel tall mountains, new apps for visually impaired people and more interactive touchscreen games.

Researchers have written an algorithm for 2D touchscreens that modify the friction between a user's finger and the screen to add physical sensations to what a viewer is looking at. Disney Research said the technology can be sued to feel features in a video (pictured)

One key feature of the algorithm is that it is light weight and can be implemented in real-time. A 3D model of objects (like the kettle seen here) can be zoomed and panned in real-time to sense fine edge and protruding features of the object

Scientists at Disney Research had previously managed to add physical sensations to virtual interactions like Microsoft Kinect by using puffs of air to give a user the sensations that they are touching what they are seeing on screen.

But they have now applied their idea to touchscreens in a new way, Tested reported.

The algorithm, for 'the tactile rendering of 3D features' on a 2D touchscreen, modifies the friction by producing subtle vibrations based on the slope of a virtual surface.

For example, if there is a dome on the screen, increased friction could make it feel like a user is passing their finger over a bump.

The algorithm modifies the friction between a person's finger and the screen, based on the slope of a virtual surface. For example, if there is a dome on the screen, increased friction could make it feel like a user is passing their finger over a bump

Disney Research claims that it can reproduce edges, ridges, protrusions and bumps as well as other sensations using its technology, which creates the ability for people to feel the geography of maps, including raised mountains (pictured)

The algorithm does this by modifying the voltage of the display to vary its friction so that different textures will affect the sensations a user feels in their fingertips.

Disney Research claims that it can reproduce edges, ridges, protrusions and bumps as well as other sensations using its technology.

The company said: 'A person sliding a finger across a 
topographic map displayed on a touch screen can feel the bumps and 
curves of hills and valleys, despite the screen’s smooth surface, with 
the aid of a novel algorithm.

The method can be used to simulate the feel of a wide variety of objects and textures.   

Disney Research said the algorithm is based on a discovery that when a person slides a finger over a real physical bump, they perceive the bump largely because lateral friction forces stretch and compress skin on the sliding finger. Users touching this image with the technology would feel bumps - the surface of the apples

Disney Research said: 'The algorithm is based on a discovery 
that when a person slides a finger over a real physical bump, the person
perceives the bump largely because lateral friction forces stretch and 
compress skin on the sliding finger.'

The algorithm is able to produce varying sensations and does not have to rely on a library of textures to apply to objects as it can produce custom textures at it goes.

Ivan Poupyrev, who directs Disney Research, Pittsburgh’s Interaction Group, said: 'Our brain perceives the 3D bump on a surface mostly from information that it receives via skin stretching.

'Therefore, if we can artificially stretch 
skin on a  finger as it slides on the touch screen, the brain will be 
fooled into thinking an actual physical bump is on a touch screen even 
though the touch surface is completely smooth.'

The technology could be used in various ways in the future, including being embedded into next-generation touchscreen displays.

Depth maps extracted from Kinect-like sensors are used to render fine features on visual images that are not touchable or reachable. The user touching this images would feel the ridges of the fossil
