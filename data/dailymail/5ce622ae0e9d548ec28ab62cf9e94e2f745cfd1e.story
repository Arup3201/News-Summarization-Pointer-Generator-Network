Cristiano Ronaldo dispelled fears he may miss Portugal's opening World Cup match with Germany by training with minimal strapping on his left knee on Friday.

The Real Madrid superstar had caused concern in the camp after leaving training early on Thursday with an ice pack attached to his knee, suggesting he had not fully recovered from the problem that affected the end of his club season.

The 29-year-old, who is widely predicted to be a star of the tournament in Brazil, hobbled out of Thursday's session after less than 20 minutes and watched the rest from the sidelines.

Precaution: The Real Madrid star wasn't too restricted in his movements as he juggled the ball with his left leg

Concerns: Ronaldo left Portugal's training session on Thursday with a recurrence of his knee problem, raising doubts that he might not make the World Cup opener against Germany

Worries: Ronaldo had his knee strapped with ice after Thursday's session and was left on the sidelines

But he was back with a ball at his feet on Friday morning, playing a full part while wearing just a light strap around the affected knee.

Indeed, he was at the centre of things throughout, making forceful points to Fabio Coentrao, Nani and others as they worked through their training routines. Â

That's better: Ronaldo manages a smile later in the session as Portugal continues their preparations for the match with Germany

The current Ballon d'Or winner was out of action for two weeks with tendinitis in the knee before the World Cup - an injury which had largely been kept a secret.

But he still ended the season on a high, scoring Real's fourth goal in their 4-1 Champions League final win over city rivals Atletico.

Boost: Ronaldo's return to training is certainly good news for Portugal coach Paulo Bento

After some time off, Ronaldo played 66 minutes of Portugal's 5-1 friendly win over the Republic of Ireland in New York on Wednesday.

Portugal start their Group G campaign against Germany in Salvador on Monday, before facing the United States in Manaus on June 22 and Ghana in Brasilia on June 26.
