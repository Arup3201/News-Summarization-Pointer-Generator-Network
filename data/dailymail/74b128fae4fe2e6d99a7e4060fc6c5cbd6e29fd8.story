Starbucks plans to jump into the thriving Greek-style yogurt market by teaming up with a yogurt maker Danone.

Together they'll create a ready-to-eat yogurt cup they hope will compete with brands like Chobani that are flying off shelves.

The Seattle-based Starbucks and the French food and drink company will have their collaboration on Starbucks store shelves in Spring 2014.

New offering: Starbucks has announced it will have a line of Greek yogurt on its shelves by 2014

They'll be called Evolution Fresh inspired by Dannon, part of Starbucksâ€™ mounting push into the health and wellness arena.

Distribution to grocery stores is planned for 2015, with global expansion to follow, the companies said. Financial terms of the multiyear deal weren't disclosed.

Greek yogurt, which is thicker and has a tarter taste, has surged in popularity in recent years and now accounts for more than a third of the market, according to Bernstein Research.

The U.S. retail market for yogurt is estimated at $7 billion, according to Euromonitor International, a sales tracking firm, having grown an average 8.5 percent during the last five years.

Fans like that Greek yogurt tends to have more protein and less sugar than the sweeter, thinner varieties traditionally sold in American supermarkets.

The popularity of brands such as Chobani and Fage has prompted makers of traditional supermarket yogurt, such as General Mills' Yoplait, to scramble to introduce Greek varieties.

Danone makes Dannon, Stonyfield and Activia yogurt in the U.S. It introduced Oikos Greek yogurt in 2011.

Starbucks Corp. and Danone say distribution will eventually expand to targeted markets outside the U.S. The companies did not provide any details on pricing or the products.

The move also builds on Starbucks' push to improve its food. It has been introducing Evolution Fresh juices and plans to roll out new baked goods in the year ahead. New sandwiches and salads were also recently introduced.
