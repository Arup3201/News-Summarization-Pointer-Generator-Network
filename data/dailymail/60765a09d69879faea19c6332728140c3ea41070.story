Only the fortunate few get to walk away from sport on their own terms. Even fewer do so with a freshly-minted gold medal as a souvenir from their final farewell.

Chris Sherrington admits he couldn’t have staged his exit any better after confirming his retirement from judo this week in the wake of his heavyweight triumph at the Commonwealth Games.

The Olympian, 31, has donned his robe and belt for the last time. But there will be plenty more fights to come. ‘I love a good scrap,’ laughs the Sportsmail columnist. ‘Love it.’ 

Returning to duty: Sherrinton salutes after taking gold in Glasgow and will now return to the Royal Marines

Except it will now come caked in mud and possibly in enemy territory with a full-time return to his day job as a Royal Marine Commando.

The decision was made a week ago. ‘I looked at all my options. I was looking at a silver medal I won at a Grand Prix in Cuba. There’s only five or six judokas in the UK who have one of those medals and that was my second. It’s an incredible achievement. 

'But I have to step back and take the sensible decision and that’s to go home.’ Where that is remains a destination unknown, to whichever foreign land he is required on his next tour of duty. 

Judo was a distraction and an outlet for his frustrations, an escape route from the demons of drink that threatened to dole his career a knockout blow.

It was never meant to take him so far away from criss-crossing the globe in the services of his country.

‘It’s all I’ve wanted to do since I was 17,’ Sherrington insists. ‘The Navy’s given me so many opportunities. And I’m very grateful for that. It’s made me an Olympian. It’s allowed me to go places. 

'It is hard to give up judo because I could have go on to Rio and got a medal. But what swung it is that I’ve been based in Walsall and there’s not the level of coaching there I need to be at my very best.’ 

There’s also self-interest here. While his sporting ranking has rarely been higher, his service standing has dropped off the charts. 

‘Currently, I’ve got no rank,’ he reveals. ‘It’s only 10 years until I retire and my pension is based on my rank at that point so I need to work hard to improve that. I only did four and a half years before I got my sports draft so I’ve a lot to make up for.’ 

Duty calls: The Olympian will have to return to service and improve his rank as he moves away from sport

A course in coping with missions in the mountains is booked in. The training regime has already kicked off. Thirteen kilos have been trimmed off since he left the mat in Glasgow. 

‘I was probably a little chubby there. And I’ve another five to go before I can start running again and get out there with a rucksack on my back.’ 

That will come in the autumn. After nine years without a holiday, with a honeymoon still owed to wife Zoe, the Lancashire-born Scot is under strict orders from his superiors to have a breather before he reports back.

There are bookings for school visits in the meantime. But still plenty of gaps in the diary. 

The first mission on the slate is to get the message out about the power of sport and the benefits from fighting to reach one goal before targeting the next.

‘I want to be a role model,’ he says. ‘I think I’ve a duty to show these young kids that you can achieve huge things, even if you’re someone like me who didn’t do that well at school. 

Achievement: The sport allowed Sherrington to compete in front of a home crowd at London 2012

'I look at footballers. They have such a great opportunity to be positive role models but for some reason, they don’t do it. So if there’s anyone who wants me to come and talk at their school, I’ll be right there.’ 

Some have already been inspired. Sherrington was coaxed on stage last week at a concert in Linlithgow Palace but was approached afterwards by four men who had watched him in action.

All were ex-Marines, all with the Falklands War on their CVs. ‘That was much tougher than anything I’ve ever had,’ he recounts. ‘And they told me they were proud of what I’ve achieved. That was just a really emotional moment. 

'To get that applause from the crowd is one thing but to have it from them meant so much to me.’ 

It is an eternal brotherhood. Team GB has strong bonds but nothing like those forged in the line of fire. 

But the memories of what he accomplished in his stints on the mat will follow him now wherever he goes. And he leaves the stage as a champion, a privilege afforded only to the lucky or the brave.

In hindsight, he saved his best to last. ‘I was so focused on getting that fight right,’ Sherrington smiles. ‘I knew if I did well, there’d be some media attention but I never expected everything that happened. 

'Same with the public. The home crowd was incredible. I know I’ll never have something like that again.

‘But to finish the fight in the final the way I did was exactly what I wanted. It was so clean. I did my job perfectly. It was my time and it felt amazing.’
