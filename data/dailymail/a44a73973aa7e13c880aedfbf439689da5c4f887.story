Thank you: Emily Ruckle pauses outside her family's car as she visits the Newark Police Department on the way home from the hospital after the severe dog attack last month

She almost lost her arm to a vicious dog attack last month, enduring nine surgeries to rescue it, but before she went home on Tuesday, Emily Ruckle went to thank the police who saved her life.

The eight-year-old New Jersey girl stopped at Newark Police Headquarters after being released 30-days early, having surprised doctors with her recovery when she managed to lift her right shoulder.

But before she went home to hug her family German shepherd, Kona, and even before she grabbed a bite at her favorite Chick-fil-A, Emily 'stopped to say thank you to the men in blue.'

Arriving at the station with her mom Maria and dad, Todd, who is a Newark councilman, Emily greeted her heroes with a smile.

Despite her release from hospital, Emily's recovery is not complete yet and she has months of intensive rehabilitation in front of her.

'It's a long journey, and we're all going to do it together as a family,' said Todd Ruckle to Delaware Online. 'We're going to get this arm better.'

Emily was attacked on September 27 at her own family house while a dog belonging to her mother's ex-husband was being watched.

The dog, which was called Frank, was being looked after by Emily's half brother, according to Delaware Online.

Recovery: Emily should have spent another month at least in hospital but was released due to the speed of her recovery 

The dog attacked Emily when she let it out back, believing it needed the bathroom.

The attack was vicious and left Emily with a wound so severe that her arm was nearly torn off.

Emily Ruckle was bitten multiple times by the pit bull and suffered severe soft-tissue injuries and blood loss from the attackThe girl's sister called the emergency services and stemmed the bleeding until paramedics arrived.

When officers arrived they shot the dog dead.

She went through nine surgeries at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and had three of her severed nerve bundles reaatched.

'That could take nine months to see if that works,' Todd Ruckle said to Delaware Online. 'That's when we will find out if anything moves and if she gets feeling back in her arm.'

'But five days ago, after this, she could lift her entire shoulder up. So the doctor was really shocked that she could do that already.'

Todd Ruckle told the Delaware Online that he was extremely happy and thankful for all the support he and his family have received.

Indeed, a recent fundraiser online collected more than $30,000 for Emily's medical costs.

'Our entire family just wants to say thank you for the outreach, all the prayers, all the positive thoughts,' Todd Ruckle said.

'There are thousands and thousands and thousands of people that have wished us well.'

Longtime Ruckle friend, Jerry Clifton, said that he was happy Emily had returned home.

'It speaks well to The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia that they managed to get her home so quickly, and I trust she'll heal well in the weeks to come,' said Clifton to Delaware Online.

'I think emotionally, it's better for her to be home, if possible.'
