An Illinois police sergeant suspected of being drunk during a St Patrick's Day car crash has been released on bond.

Authorities say 47-year-old Fairview Heights police officer James Krummrich was off duty when he was arrested on Saturday on suspicion of driving his personal vehicle under the influence.

He was booked after being involved in a crash at about 5.45pm in the 900 block of North Illinois. He allegedly appeared intoxicated.

Fairview Heights Police Chief Nick Gailius said Krummrich is a 15-year police veteran now on paid administrative leave as the department investigates.

'It's important to note that everyone is presumed innocent until proven guilty in court,' Gailius said.

'We are very thankful that no one was injured in the accident,' Gailius said.

Experienced: Krummrich is an instructor at the Southwestern Illinois Police Academy

He has been a sergeant since 2008 and earns more than $86,000 as a patrol supervisor, according to The Belleville News-Democrat.

He also teaches at the Southwestern Illinois Police Academy.

Krummrich didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment that was left Tuesday night.
