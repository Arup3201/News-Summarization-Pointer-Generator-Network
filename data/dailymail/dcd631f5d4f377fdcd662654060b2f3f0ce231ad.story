An elementary school assistant principal has been forced to resign after being confronted with cell phone footage showing him having sex with a younger teacher in his office during school time.

Carnell Lee, 39, stepped down as assistant principal at Deerwood Academy in Atlanta, Georgia, on January 9 just days after an unnamed female co-worker, 28, went to the police accusing him of stalking her.

The woman called Atlanta police Jan. 5, when she also alleged that Lee threatened her job and extorted money from her.

Both Lee and his younger colleague have stepped down from their positions at Deerwood Academy in Atlanta, Georgia, since the beginning of the year

No criminal charges were filed against Lee, but the issue was referred to the Atlanta Public Schools (APS) who launched an internal investigation, reports the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Lee, a married father of two, had worked for APS for 14 years and is a former army officer.

Lee denied stalking her, and claimed she had been pursuing him since starting her job at Deerwood, according to a letter included in his personnel file.

He wrote that they had sex in his office after hours, and she often told him she loved and cared for him.

Their relationship began a few days after the two met last summer, and she wrote in a January 13 account that she told him ‘no’ five or six times during their first encounter.

Sex in his office continued at other 
times afterward, although she wrote in a January 22 letter to an APS 
employee relations manager that she repeatedly told him she wanted it to
 stop.

She wrote she felt threatened that she would lose her career.

But in a charge letter sent to her by the APS, they noted that she had admitted to engaging in consensual sex on top of Lee’s desk and to him recording them having sex in his office in November.

The letter stated: ‘…you had consensual sex with your co-worker, Carnell Lee on the top of his desk in his office…You requested that Mr. Lee record you engaging in sex with him…you admitted to having consensual sex with Mr. Lee in his office during your scheduled work hours on two separate occasions.’

The APS's internal investigation also uncovered of text and hand written messages exchanged between the two.

The unnamed co-worker then resigned from the school a month after Lee on Feb. 7, although she continues to dispute the nature of their relationship.

She was participating in a leadership internship at Deerwood Academy, where she worked as assistant principal for kindergarten through second grade.

Lee published this photo of his office on Facebook last September. He was forced to resign in January after cell phone footage surfaced of him having sex with a colleague in his office
