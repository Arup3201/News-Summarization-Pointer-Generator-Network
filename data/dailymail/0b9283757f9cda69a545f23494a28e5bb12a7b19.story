Smuggling: Officials seized a total of 1,209 pieces of ivory tusk and 1.4 kilograms of ivory ornaments worth over £2million

The ivory from endangered species was hidden in bags of plastic scrap

The next day, officers found 237 pieces of ivory tusks also weighing 4,188lb in a shipment from Kenya.

The ivory was hidden in bags of plastic scrap. Authorities in China arrested seven people, including one from Hong Kong.

The ivory seizure tops one in 2011 worth £1.4 million.

It was said to be the biggest haul of ivory tusk in Hong Kong customs enforcement history in a single operation

Lam Tak-fai, head of Hong Kong's Ports and Maritime Command, said: 'This is the biggest haul of ivory tusk in Hong Kong customs enforcement history in a single operation.'

Wildlife activists blame China's growing presence in Africa for an unprecedented surge in poaching elephants for their tusks, most of which are believed to be smuggled to China and Thailand to make ivory ornaments.

Under Hong Kong law, anyone found guilty of trading in endangered species products can be faces up to two years in prison and a fine of up to 640,000 US dollars (nearly £400,000).
