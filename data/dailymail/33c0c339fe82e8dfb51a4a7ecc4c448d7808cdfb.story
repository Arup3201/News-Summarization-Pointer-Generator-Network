Search around on the internet and you can easily find thousands of images of severe weather, from fantastic bolts of lightning to giant tornadoes.

But what is actually taking place in these images? That’s what a new book will be detailing, showing some of the incredible processes taking place in various superstorms.

Diagrams will reveal the formation of lighting, the inflow of wind into a storm and much more - alongside hundreds of high-resolution weather images.

Two Texas-based storm chasers are to release a book detailing how severe weather forms. Their amazing images will be overlayed with diagrams showing the motion of wind, precipitation and more. Shown is a diagram detailing how a classic supercell storm forms

Zach Roberts and Jason Weingart, from Texas, are currently seeking funding for their book ‘The Anatomy of Severe Weather’ on Kickstarter, which was designed by Savannah Williams.

It will contain 200 high-resolution images of weather including tornadoes, lightning, supercell thunderstorms and more.

The book, due to be released towards the end of the year, has clear page overlays so readers can view the images in their original form - and with the additional information on top.

According to the team, it ‘will also include detailed explanations of how and why severe weather occurs, historical references to past milestone weather events and storm chasing stories behind the scenes to give you an idea of how to capture these images.’

The team hope that their book will educate people on the dangers of certain weather formations, like tornadoes seen here

Known as the 'mother of tornadoes', a mesocyclone can be up to six miles wide and can produce as many as 60 tornadoes.

These severe thunderstorms form where cold dry air meets warm moist tropical air.

The wind coming into the storm starts to swirl and forms a funnel. The air in the funnel spins faster and faster and creates a very low pressure area which sucks more air - and objects - into it.

If the cyclone runs out of wet, warm surface air, it dies out. If it does not run out of this fuel, however, the rotating cloud stretches toward the ground and may become a giant tornado. 

In one example, the anatomy of a classic supercell storm is shown.

Towards the bottom of the storm, large hail and heavy precipitation can be seen pouring down from the clouds onto the ground.

An updraft in the cloud is also identified, while a  cloud with an imminent tornado is shown forming near to the ground.

Another shows how giant bolts of lightning move from high in the clouds to Earth. It highlights the positive charge at the start of the bolt, and a negative charge at the bottom. 

Elsewhere, the team reveal the anatomy of a monsoon thunderstorm. At its base there is a warm inflow of air, while mammatus clouds form higher up.

A terrifying tornadic supercell is also seen with a mesocyclone, while a dangerous cone tornado begins to form at the bottom.

The book also contains a special section called Franklinstein, which details their lightning research project, in which they fire probe-containing rockets into electrically charged storms in an attempt to initiate lightning.

To collect images for the book, the team plans to begin storm chasing in the spring of this year to ‘collect just the right images and have all the components in place.’
