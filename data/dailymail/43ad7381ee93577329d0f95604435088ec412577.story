The third round of the FA Youth Cup continued on Tuesday night, with Southampton, Everton and Hull City all progressing in the tournament.

Southampton saw off the challenge of West Ham United at St Mary's Stadium in an exciting affair.

Dan Demkiv's neat finish and a cracking 30-yard strike from Callum Slattery proved enough to down the Hammers as the Saints came from behind to triumph.

Unfortunately for the Hammers, Josh Pack's header did not prove to be enough as they succumbed to defeat.

Everton meanwhile advanced into the fourth round following a 2-1 victory after extra time against Stevenage.

Despite the game at the Lamex Stadium remaining goalless for the regulation 90 minutes, Calum Dyson scored a looping header just 60 seconds into extra time.

Nathan Broadhead's cool finish then wrapped the game up before Jamie Sylvester netted a consolation for the home side.

Finally, a magnificent hat-trick from Will Annan saw Hull recover from two goals down to beat Brentford after extra time at North Ferriby.

With the score at 2-0 after 75 minutes - following a penalty from James Ferry and a magnificent finish from Courtney Senior - Annan bagged two quick-fire goals to send the match into extra time.

And, with Annan seemingly determined to steal the headlines, the youngster completed the come-from-behind win with a majestic free-kick in added time to give the Tigers a 3-2 win.
