Senior MPs, lawyers and campaigners yesterday called for an end to the bail system which can leave someone languishing on police bail for months without being charged.

They said the use of pre-charge bail was a 'perversion of justice' which has left more than 70,000 on police bail as suspects without knowing if they will ever be charged.

Pre-charge bail was introduced in 1984 under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act to allow police to put restrictions on individuals before they have enough evidence to charge.

Among those who have been left in limbo by the system have been broadcaster Paul Gambaccini, on bail for nearly a year before being told there would be no action against him, and comedian Freddie Starr, 19 months on bail before the case against him was dropped. Both were arrested under the Operation Yewtree sex abuse inquiry.

Comedian Jim Davidson spent eight months on bail before being told he would face no charges over separate sex abuse allegations.

Last week former Sun journalist Clodagh Hartley was cleared by an Old Bailey jury of making unlawful payments to a tax official after spending two-and-a-half years awaiting trial, 12 months of them on pre-charge bail.

A letter signed by 25 figures, including one of the country's most senior judges and a cross-party group of MPs, called for Home Secretary Teresa May to change the law to limit pre-charge bail. 

Comedian Freddie Starr was bailed for 19 months before the case against him was dropped 

They say police should not be able to put someone on bail without charge for more than 28 days without applying to a magistrate for an extension.

The signatories included former Appeal Judge and President of the Family Division Lady Elizabeth Butler-Sloss; Tory MPs David Davis, Dominic Raab, Nigel Evans and Sir Edward Garnier; LibDem MP John Hemming and peer Brian Paddick; and Labour peer and civil rights lawyer Baroness Helena Kennedy.

Other supporters included campaigner Peter Tatchell; prison reformer Frances Crook; Green MP Caroline Lucas and military author Andy McNab.

Mr McNab said: 'The police can hold people on pre-charge bail forever. The mental and physical effects can be huge. I know a lot of people who have suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder. This can be even more stressful than the effects of war.

'Soldiers are trained to take action. If you are in operations you are in control. But in this situation you can't take any action. You just have to sit there waiting. It is madness. If the police want more than 28 days they should go to a judge to ask for it. If someone has done something wrong then they should be charged and if they are guilty then they should be punished. But to be left dangling is just wrong.'

The letter says it is a scandal that 72,000 people are on pre-charge bail and more than 5,000 of them have been on bail for more than six months.

Mrs May opened a question over pre-charge bail in October when she told the College of Policing conference that the Government would consider a statutory time limit.

The longest time anyone is thought to have been held on pre-charge bail is three-and-a-half years while the Metropolitan Police delayed a decision to bring charges.
