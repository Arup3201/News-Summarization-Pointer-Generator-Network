The veteran journalist said 'I do' to her fiance, John Molner, Saturday in the Hamptons in an intimate ceremony.

The happy couple, who have been together for two years, exchanged their vows in the backyard of Couric’s home in East Hampton, New York, in front of 50 close friends and family.

The 57-year-old blushing bride wore an ivory Chantilly lace gown designed by Carmen Marc Valvo heavily embellished with beading and embroidery, which she had picked out only a week before the happy occasion. 

In a break with tradition, Couric asked her husband-to-be to weigh in on her sartorial choice for the big day.

‘I hope this isn't bad luck but I actually tried it on for him,’ she told People Magazine, adding, 'we're a very modern couple.'

Couric jokingly dubbed her new husband a 'Groomzilla,' adding that he was very involved in the wedding planning.

The glowing bride had her blonde locks arranged in a flirty coif parted on the side and decorated with white flowers to match her all-white bouquet.

Couric accessorized her wedding look with silver strappy sandals, a diamond bracelet on her right wrist and a pair of 5.5 carat diamond earrings, which were a present from her new spouse.   

According to Page Six, the 57-year-old talk show host settled on a Jeffrey Rackover wedding band set with two carats of pavé diamond.

Mr Molner, a financier who is seven years her junior, proposed to the mother-of-two over Labor Day weekend last September after they had been dating for nearly two years.

This is a second marriage for the talk
 show host, who has two daughters - 22-year-old Ellie and 18-year-old 
Carrie - with her late husband Jay Monahan.

Monahan
 passed away in 1998 at the age of 42 after a six-month battle with 
colon cancer. Couric has since become an active spokesperson for colon 
cancer awareness.

In
 anticipation of the momentous occasion Saturday, Couric told the 
publication that their goal was to keep the wedding low-key.

'This is not my first rodeo so I didn't want to go too crazy and neither did John,' explained the bride.

Mr
 Molner, a native of Chicago, is the head of mergers and acquisitions at
 investment bank and securities firm Brown Brothers Harriman.

The newlyweds plan to go on their honeymoon in December. E! Online reported that they have yet to settle on a destination, but New Zealand is a strong contender.

'I've never been there and always been on my bucket list,' said Couric.

Wedding bling! Couric has picked out a Jeffrey Rackover wedding band set with two carats of pavé diamond, as well as 5.5-carat diamond earrings - both gifts from Molner 

The couple stepped out together publicly for the first time in September 2012, when they attended a screening of The Perks of Being a Wallflower in East Hampton, New York.

Since then they have attended numerous events together - from the U.S. Open last September to the Super Bowl in February and the Met Gala in May of this year.

Couric confirmed their engagement last fall via Twitter, posting: 'Yes it's true! So touched by all the kind Tweets & warm wishes-thank you! A great end to the summer!!'
