With his finger on the trigger and his eyes fixated on the target ahead, these chilling photos show a babyfaced Eric Frein training with his high school shooting team. 

Now 31-years-old, the 'Cold War-obsessed' survivalist sniper has been placed on the FBI's most Wanted Fugitives list after he allegedly gunned down state trooper Byron Dickson during an ambush on Friday.  

The bureau is offering a $100,000 reward for anyone who has information that leads to his capture as the manhunt entered its sixth day.

Pennsylvania Crime Stoppers have also said they will hand over $75,000 to anyone who has vital information on his whereabouts. 

State Police are now trying to flush the man they suspect of killing a trooper out of dense, swampy northeastern Pennsylvania woodland, having eliminated his other possible hiding places.

Hunt intensifies: Frein was added to the FBI's Most Wanted Fugitive List as the manhunt entered its sixth day. He is believed to have gunned down state trooper Bryon Dickson during an ambush on Friday

As the search for Cpl. Dickson's killer continued 40 miles away, police Commissioner Frank Noonan told hundreds of mourners gathered at St. Peter's Cathedral in Scranton, Pennsylvania, that the father-of-two 'was no ordinary trooper.' 

The mourners included Dickson's wife, Tiffany, who wore dark sunglasses as she held the hand of their youngest son Adam.

The FBI said at a news conference today it is assisting in the search with 'manpower, technical and air assets' and that Frein's photo will be 'broadcast on electronic billboards up and down the whole East Coast.'

'We have now made the world where he can hide a very small place,' said Edward Hanko, FBI special agent in charge of the Philadelphia division. 

A roadblock was set up around Frein's parents home on Thursday, but it was reopened and officers confirmed he is still at large.  

New images of the suspected killer obtained by ABC show him at rifle practice in high school and in his yearbook photo - with little emotion on his face.

Dickson, 38, was gunned down late Friday outside his rural barracks in the Pocono Mountains.

Police are still searching for the suspected shooter, 31-year-old Eric Frein who is charged with killing Dickson and wounding another trooper in an ambush that authorities said was likely fueled by his hatred of law enforcement. 

They believe he is still in the general area, adding that one of his hobbies is surviving outside. Lt. Col. George Bivens said he is probably trying to endure the cold night somewhere in the woods, something he has done in the past. 

Schools near the Blooming Grove barracks shut down a second day Thursday even as police said it's likely law enforcement, not the public, would be the target of any further violence.

Yesterday it was revealed Frein belonged to a 'military simulation unit' whose members play the role of soldiers from Cold War eastern Europe. 

It was also revealed Frein learned to shoot from his father, Eugene Michael Frein, 64, a retired Army major with 28 years of service. 

Dickson (seen left with his wife Tiffany and two young sons, Bryon III and Adam) was a Marine Corps veteran who joined the state police in 2007 and had worked as a patrol unit supervisor in the Blooming Grove barracks since June

He told state police his son was a better marksman than he and someone who 'doesn't miss.' 

Mourners attending Dickson's funeral Mass gathered 'in sorrow, disbelief and anger,' the Rev. Thomas Muldowney said, but he asked them to focus on the positive impact that Dickson made during his life.

Dickson was killed on Friday night in an ambush shooting at the state police barracks in Blooming Grove Township. Another trooper was wounded in the ambush that touched off a massive manhunt for Eric Frein, 31, identified Tuesday as the suspect

The word that best describes Dickson is 'impeccable,' Cpl. Derek Felsman said during his eulogy. Felsman said his best friend took perfect care of his wife, crafted flawless wood toys for his two sons and always wore a crisp and spotless uniform with gleaming leather boots and belt.

He was a 'steadfast soldier of the law' who regularly worked past quitting time to take drunken drivers off the street, Felsman said. 

But he also had a sense of humor.

Working the midnight shift in Philadelphia and unable to spend last Valentine's Day with his wife, Dickson agreed to eat dinner with his pal Felsman.

Eric Frein, 31, (seen left and right as a war reenactor) was identified Tuesday as the suspect. Police named Frein the suspect after finding his abandoned SUV, which contained his driver's license and spent shell casings matching those at the crime scene

They walked into the candle-lit Italian restaurant and found it packed with couples, love in the air.

'At first, he couldn't believe we were actually getting a bite to eat surrounded in an atmosphere of mushiness and romance. 

'He quickly overcome those thoughts, and then jokingly asked me to ask to sit on the same side of the booth as him,' Felsman said, drawing laughter.

Thousands of law enforcement officers from around the country came to Scranton to pay their respects, lining up 10 deep outside the church for the funeral procession under a cloudless blue sky.

A single bell tolled for more than 20 minutes before the casket arrived, and the sea of uniformed officers stood at attention in utter silence.

As Dickson was being laid to rest at a nearby cemetery, the hunt went on for a man police described as a self-taught survivalist who had expressed anti-law enforcement and anti-government feelings for years.

Police named Frein as the suspect after finding his abandoned SUV a couple miles from the barracks. 

They said it contained his driver's license and spent shell casings matching those at the crime scene.

State police have warned the public that Frein, of Canadensis, is dangerous, saying he has talked about committing mass murder. 

They are urging residents to be alert and cautious, but Lt. Col. George Bivens also said he believes Frein's 'engaged in a personal battle with law enforcement, particularly the Pennsylvania State Police, and will likely stay focused on that fight.'
