Redknapp won the argument with owner Tony Fernandes last week to sign former Manchester United and England defender Rio Ferdinand.

The 35-year-old arrived on a free transfer and Redknapp is ready to make more incomings in the next few days.

And Redknapp was quick to point out that Ferdinand opted for QPR other their competitors in the market.

'He had other offers,' said Redknapp. 'He could've gone to two top London clubs who wanted to speak to him, where he might have played and not played, but he wanted to come here.

'I can't say who they were but that's 100 per cent fact.'

After completing a medical on Thursday, Ferdinand arrived at Loftus Road to sign the contract and conduct in-house media duties.
