Supermodel Cindy Crawford has proven she can look flawless in any photo - at any time of the day - after Instagramming a stunning snap of herself in bed, just minutes after waking up.

The 48-year-old supermodel can be seen lying against a pillow, clutching her comforter in the sultry snap, which she captioned: '#WAKEUPCALL Support #ChildrenofSyria @UNICEFUSA: http://bit.ly/1v5lGqT I nominate @CTurlington @SoniaKashuk @MmeGrey.'

Cindy is the latest celebrity to join in Unicef’s #WakeUpCall campaign, a social media charity fundraiser which has been dubbed ‘the new Ice Bucket Challenge’, which has raised more than $100 million for the previously little-known disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Unicef’s campaign asks participants to take a selfie shortly after waking up - usually while still in bed - share it on social media and donate $8 to Unicef, before nominating others to do the same.

Ms Crawford's nominees were fellow model Christy Turlington, make-up mogul Sonia Kashuk and Cassandra Grey, the founder of beauty e-commerce website Violet Grey.

Other celebrities, such as Naomi Campbell, Liam Neeson and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, have already contributed to the campaign, which is raising money for Syrian children in need.

The brunette beauty looks beautiful bare-faced, but she was equally stunning last week when she stepped out with husband Rande Gerber at the Brian Bowen Smith Wildlife show in West Hollywood.

She recently shared her skincare regime with Violet Grey, revealing, 'I’ve been getting microdermabrasion facials with Cristina Radu for 13 years, and that’s been great for my skin.'

She continued: 'I’ve been working with the dermatologist Jean-Louis Sebagh on my skin-care line - also for 13 years - and he knows what he’s doing. Dr. Sebagh is not about damaging your skin with lasers and peels to make it look better.

Stunning: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley also joined the #WakeUpCall campaign to help the thousands of children caught up in the Syrian crisis and shared a bare-faced picture of herself on Instagram

'I use SPF day cream every day, cleanser every day and night. I definitely use the night cream, eye cream and the Crème de Serum from my line. What I think is true is that [results are] cumulative. When a 35-year-old starts taking care of her skin, she won’t look different. It’s when you’re my age that you start seeing the payoff.'

In June, she announced that she's already planning to celebrate her 50th birthday with a coffee table book that will feature photos as well as the secrets of her success.

'It'll come out in the fall before I turn 50, so it's kind of a way to celebrate 50 as opposed to dreading it,' she said.
