Annaleisa Gordon was found to have used a police computer to search for information about her ex-husband, Christopher McNair, and has been sacked

An anti-terror policewoman who used Scotland Yard computers to look for information on her ex-husband has been sacked.

PC Annaleisa Gordon conducted the unauthorised searches on Christopher McNair while working for the Met's counter-terrorism squad in 2010 and 2011.

A court later heard she feared he was dead or missing and was frantically trying to find him.

Gordon was found guilty of a data protection offence in 2013 and has now been sacked from the Metropolitan Police.

The 50-year-old was appointed counter-terror intelligence officer to the borough of Greenwich, south-east London in 2007 after joining the police in 1988.

A Scotland Yard spokesman said today: 'Police Constable Annaleisa Gordon, an officer attached to Specialist Operations, was dismissed without notice on Monday from the Metropolitan Police Service following a misconduct hearing.'

The force said that Gordon had 'breached standards of professional behaviour' in relation to 'discreditable conduct and confidentiality'.

The spokesman added: 'The panel agreed these circumstances amount to gross misconduct. She was subsequently dismissed.'

During her trial, the court heard Gordon feared her ex was missing or even dead and that's why she accessed records, dating back to 2004.

She was convicted of one count of obtaining personal data which breached the Data Protection Act.

Sentencing her after her two-day trial at Southwark Crown Court, Recorder Aidan Christie said he accepted her actions were 'entirely out of character'.

He said she not acted out of 'malice or with sinister motives', but due to fears Mr McNair was missing.

Gordon was fined £350 for the data protection offence. She was cleared of a further two charges in relation to searches for information on two roads, one being her mother's and the other her own address, between 2009 and 2011.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police today confirmed her actions amounted to gross misconduct

The judge said: 'You have no convictions, no cautions, no police warnings and a clean disciplinary record. Your record of service is a credit to you.

'You have references from your former supervisor which speaks in glowing terms of your absolute integrity with sensitive information.

'You accept you should not have go about things in the way you did and should have reported the matter to the missing persons division.

'It was an error of judgment for which you have paid a very high price.'
