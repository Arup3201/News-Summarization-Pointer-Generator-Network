Journalist Whit Sheppard, 48, sent a letter to Deerfield Academy's head of school Margaret Curtis in June 2012 disclosing details about faculty member Peter Hindle

The man who was the catalyst in exposing a sex scandal at an elite boarding school that counts a king and a Nobel Prize laureate as its alumni today revealed his identity to speak out about the alleged sex attack allegedly at the hands of a trusted and popular teacher.

Journalist Whit Sheppard, 48, sent a letter to Deerfield Academy's head of school Margaret Curtis in June 2012, disclosing details about faculty member Peter Hindle, who he said sexually abused him during his senior year in the winter of 1983.

The letter sparked an internal investigation at the $50,000-a-year school and another student and member of staff were implicated.

A subsequent criminal investigation was also launched and is still underway.

Whit penned an essay for the Boston Globe's Sunday magazine detailing what he says happened at the boarding school.

He also revealed he wrote to then-headmaster Eric Widmer in 2004 detailing bullying and sexual abuse but nothing was made of it.

Reading about the abuse in the Catholic Church and Penn State inspired Whit to again do something about it. That and two other reasons - 'I knew that what had taken place was wrong, and I knew that the truth was with me,' he wrote.

'For years I had hesitated to speak up 
because of my own shame and embarrassment about the abuse I had 
suffered, the concern that I might not be believed, and the potential 
for significant pushback from a legion of Hindle admirers.'

After the scandal broke, before Sheppard's identity was revealed, a 'legion of Hindle admirers' did come out to defend their teacher, who was something of a legend at the school and had acquired the nickname 'Czar'.

Dave Orrick, who graduated from Deerfield in 1989, told the New York Times of his former teacher: 'He was debonair, he was very well-dressed, his hair was well-parted, he had a gentlemanly way about him.

'A guy like Peter Hindle seemed to have a level of wisdom, and a level of openness and warmth that I think a lot of people actually gravitated to.'

Allegations: Deerfield Academy, a $50,000-a-year school in Franklin County, Massachusetts, pictured, has notified police after an ex-student claimed retired maths teacher, Peter Hindle, had 'sexual contact' with him in the 1980s

In January, the school in Franklin County, Massachusetts, alerted students, alumni and their 
parents with a notice on its website and a letter, stating the former teacher had admitted to inappropriate relations with students 
during his 44-year tenure.

The school's letter, which was signed by Philip Greer, the president of the board, and Margarita Curtis, said: 'The Board of Trustees has determined to rename the Peter G. Hindle ’52 Schoolmaster’s Chair, remove his name from the school’s squash facility, and forbid him from attending events on campus.'

However the 78-year-old, who taught at the school from 1956 to 2000, told the Boston Herald he will dispute the allegations, saying he only 'gave someone a back rub' and that sexual conduct was 'all in interpretation'.

But Whit Sheppard paints a very different version of events.

Admitting that he was very fond of 
the teacher from the get go, he said of Hindle: 'I was struck by 
his charisma and all-around aura of coolness.

'I suppose I hoped that some of it 
might rub off on my adolescent self when I was in his orbit. He had a 
way of fixing his gaze on you that was disarming.'

The alleged abuse started midway 
through the fall term of his senior year, he said, when Hindle 'initiated an 
insistent campaign to give me a back rub'.

He turned him down a few times but said he never suspected anything untoward.

'A highly esteemed "man’s man" who 
was genuinely interested in the well-being of his charges,' Sheppard wrote. 'He was the 
last person I would have suspected of being sexually interested in 
adolescent boys, or in me.'

He then went on to describe the night he took him up on the back rub and said nothing of a sexual nature occurred at first.

It was a month later when he offered him another back rub that the first 'assault' took place.

'He massaged my legs and buttocks and then 
masturbated me to climax,' Sheppard details. 'The abuse continued over the next several 
weeks, more than eight times, wordless exchanges that escalated to 
include Hindle performing fellatio on me.

'I would climax, roll over, and
 feign sleep. He would gather himself up, close the door, and walk down 
the hallway to his apartment. It was as if nothing had ever happened.

'In hindsight, I believe Hindle 
"groomed" me over time, fixing upon me because I was troubled, 
vulnerable, and craving positive adult attention.'

After graduating, Sheppard turned to 
alcohol to numb the pain of the abuse before finally seeking help and 
going into rehab and then AA.

'I was slugging down drinks by myself
 in a Dallas nightclub just hours after leaving Deerfield for the last 
time, and the ensuing months were a blur of intoxication, degradation, 
and humiliating episodes,' he revealed.

He has been sober since 1985.

A previous student who came out in defense of Hindle when the accusations first emerged, penning a heartfelt letter of support, commented on Sheppard's story today, saying it 'added an element of undeniable credibility' to the allegations.

The school counts Taylor Swift's 
ex-boyfriend Conor Kennedy as a student and boasts high profile alumni 
including King Abdullah II al-Hussein of Jordan, billionaire 
philanthropist David H. Koch, Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes and actor 
Matthew Fox.

'I think it's all in interpretation,' he told the Boston Herald of the allegations. 'It depends on what you mean by sexual contact. I gave someone a back rub. I don't even know who it is.'

But said he had no idea which former student made the allegations.

'I've given a number (of back rubs) over the years,' he said. 'I can't tell you.'

In the school's investigation, they found evidence of similar conduct between Hindle and at least one other student, as well as evidence that a second teacher, Bryce Lambert, had sexual contact with two students. Lambert died in 2007, another teacher who had acquired legendary status.

The 600-student school was founded in 1797 and also educated numerous Rockefellers, 1990 Nobel Prize winner physicist Henry W. Kendal and David M. Childs, the architect behind the new One World Trade Center skyscraper in New York.

Deerfield Academy, the school now facing claims of 'sexual contact' between a teacher and student in the 1980s, has turned out scores of famous alumni in its 200-year history.

The academy is an independent, coeducational boarding school in Deerfield, Massachusetts.

A four-year college-preparatory school, it has approximately 600 students and about 100 faculty, all of whom live on or near campus.

Alumni include King Abdullah II al-Hussein of Jordan, Time Warner CEO Jeffrey Bewkes, billionaire and 1984 Vice Presidential candidate David H. Koch and 1990 Nobel Prize laureate physicist Henry W. Kendal.

Deerfield also educated numerous Rockefellas, David M. Childs, the architect behind the new One World Trade Center skyscraper in New York, and actor Matthew Fox as well as scores of congressmen, ambassadors and sports stars.

Taylor Swift's former flame and Conor Kennedy is a current student at the school, which costs just under $50,000 a year for boarding students and $35,920 annually for day students.
