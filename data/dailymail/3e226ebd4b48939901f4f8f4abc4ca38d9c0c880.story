A driver in China has been arrested after speeding away from a routine traffic stop with a policeman's arm stuck in his window. 

Yuan Feng was stopped by traffic police carrying out random road safety inspections in the city of Baoji in China’s north-western Shaanxi Province.

But as police officer Zhou Long, 36, reached into his white BMW to switch the engine off, Feng rolled up the window and drove off, dragging the officer along with him.

Officer Zhou Long, 36, was dragged more than a mile down the road in China after driver Yuan Feng rolled his window up on the policeman's arm as he tried to turn the car's engine off during a traffic stop

Feng stopped at a petrol station where he rolled the window down, letting Long go. He then sped off again but was caught after police set up a roadblock

Despite being chased by several other patrol cars, Feng carried on driving for over a mile (2km) before he stopped at a petrol station and rolled down the window, releasing Long.

Feng then drove off again, but was caught after police set up a roadblock further down the street.

Long said: 'I thought the driver seemed suspicious because when he saw I was in a certain lane, he changed lanes. 

'When he wound up the window it had my arm in a tight grip and there was no way I could pull it out. I couldn't believe it when the lights turned green and he just drove off dragged me along the side.'

Officer Long said he stopped Feng (pictured) because he had been action suspiciously, changing lanes when he saw the police were carrying out checks 

Long's possessions, including his hat, water bottle, and ticket book were left strew across the road after he was dragged away by Feng

Officers are questioning Feng, but so far there is no explanation as to why he didn't stop (pictured, Feng's car)

Colleague Wang Xin-ru told local TV: 'We immediately jumped into our police cars and gave chase, my colleagues were blowing the whistles and once we got in pursuit we were shouting through the loud-hailer for the driver to stop, but incredibly he just ignored us. 

'It was an incredibly dangerous situation, at any stage our colleague could have come free and fallen under the wheels of the vehicle.' 

Officers are now questioning Feng, but have yet to reveal why he sped away from the traffic stop.
