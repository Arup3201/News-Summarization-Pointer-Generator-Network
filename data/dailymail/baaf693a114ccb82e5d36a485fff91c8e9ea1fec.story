One of the most expensive houses on the British market has gone up for sale at a staggering £90million.

The 21 bedroom terrace is situated on one of the finest streets in the heart of Mayfair, west London, within easy walking distance to Green Park and Hyde Park.

The house, listed on property website Zoopla, extends to approximately 18,679 sq ft and has a spacious mews house to the rear along with a garage large enough for four limousines. The property features an extensive entertaining space which is served by a new glass lift - perfect to show off the pricey pad.

Situated at the rear of the property is a mews house which includes a garage large enough for four limousines.

Lawrence Hall of Zoopla.co.uk said: 'With 21 bedrooms and the equivalent number of bathrooms, this is a serious trophy property set in the heart of Mayfair and one of the most expensive ever listed on Zoopla. It will likely appeal to a wide range of international buyers with pockets deep enough to get a foothold in one of London's most exclusive areas.'

The £90 million Mayfair mansion was built in 1749 by Benjamin Timbrell, a self-taught architect. It was first occupied by Sir Abraham Hume, a First Baronet, with subsequent occupants including Baron Colborne of Westharling and the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire.

Running costs for a London mansion like this are likely to be around £250,000 per year, with huge amounts spent on insurance, security and staff.

A spokesperson for Messila Residential said: 'It is an exclusive, discrete and grand residence located in the heart of the world class, global village of marvellous Mayfair with all London has to offer.'

A survey last year found three of the world's top 10 most expensive homes on the market were in London.

At the top of the list was the six-storey Grade 1 listed Regency mansion in Carlton House Terrace (below), just a stone's throw from Buckingham Palace, which went on the market for £250m.

Second on the list of properties due to be sold this year was a property in Kensington Palace Gardens, which was on the market for about £100m.

Properties in Los Angeles, Connecticut, Dallas, New York and Istanbul made up the rest of the list, with the third London home coming in at tenth place.

The 15-bedroom Grade II-listed mansion in The Bishop's Avenue, Hampstead was on the market for £65million.

In April last year it was reported the £250m house in Carlton House Terrace had gone on the market.

The property boasts 50,000 sq ft of living space, making it one of the capital’s largest private homes.

Reports at the time suggested a ‘strictly confidential’ brochure, which describes the house as ‘probably the finest residence in London’, had been circulating among the super-wealthy.

Details on the interior are sketchy, but there is believed to be a magnificent double staircase and a huge ballroom.

The house is registered in the British Virgin Islands and is said to be owned by a member of a Middle East royal family.
