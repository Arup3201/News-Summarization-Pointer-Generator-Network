It was once the luxury brand beloved of the fashion elite.

However, Mulberry has warned that its profits will come up short this year due to a drop in sales.

The profits warning would have been unimaginable at the height of Mulberry’s success in 2011, when it was the fastest growing luxury brand on the planet.

Warning: Luxury brand Mulberry is pinning its hopes on a new bag by model Cara Delevingne (pictured)

Key to its success was the Alexa bag, named after model and TV presenter Alexa Chung and based on a man’s satchel.

Mulberry’s former designer Emma Hill called the Alexa ‘the anti-It bag that became an It bag’ – and it became so popular that it once had a waiting list that ran into thousands and accounted for a third of Mulberry’s sales.

Combined with the classic Bayswater, it saw sales at Mulberry soar and the brand was eventually valued at £1billion.

But Mulberry has since struggled to come up with another hit on the same scale - with the launch of its Willow Tote and other designs failing to capture womens’ imaginations. It is now valued at just £340million.

The bad news sent shares to a four-year low at one point yesterday, wiping 17per cent off the value of the Somerset-firm.  

The departure of creative director Emma Hill, who was widely credited for the success of the Alexa satchel, was a blow, and was followed by a failed attempt to take the brand more upmarket.

It has since launched a range of cheaper styles and has been trying to replicate its success with Miss Chung by contributing with model of the moment Cara Delevingne this autumn. 

Executive chairman Godfrey Davis said: ‘As expected the first half has been difficult.

‘Profit before tax... is expected to be significantly below current expectations.

‘Despite the current challenges I remain confident that we build on Mulberry’s solid foundations.’

However, he said Mulberry’s fortunes have been on the up since the launch of Miss Delevingne’s line.

Mr Davies said: ‘Following the launch of the Tessie bag family during June, we introduced a new family of bags developed with Cara Delevingne at the beginning of September.

‘The reaction to these bag families has been positive and they have contributed to the improving sales trends.’ 

At £795, there is a Mini Cara Delevingne Bag in black natural leather and this rises to the top end large Cara Delevingne Bag in Black & White Camouflage at £2,500.

Inside there is small lion rivet and a heart shaped patch based on Cara’s heart tattoo.

The model has said: ‘I want there to be hidden gems inside, based on things that are personal to me, which my tattoos definitely are.’

The next new product arrives in-store during November 2014 in time for Christmas, with the launch of the new Blossom tote bag, the Mini Lily and a new collection of small leather goods. 

The firm had previously reaped the benefits of its A-list association and its products became seen as investments which would keep their value.

Celebrity fans included Victoria Beckham and Geri Halliwell, actresses Kate Winslet and Sienna Miller and models such as Claudia Schiffer.

Executive chairman Godfrey Davis said: 'As expected the first half has been difficult. Profit before tax... is expected to be significantly below current expectations. Despite the current challenges I remain confident'
