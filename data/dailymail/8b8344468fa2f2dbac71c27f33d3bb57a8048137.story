Top officials from the U.S. and Israel defended Secretary of State John Kerry on Monday against charges in the Israeli press that his efforts to secure a cease-fire in Gaza leaned toward helping the terror group Hamas.

Speaking at the National Press Club, Rice said the Obama administration is 'dismayed by some press reports in Israel mischaracterizing his efforts last week to achieve a cease-fire.'

'We know these misleading reports in turn raise concerns here at home in America.'

Kerry is seen among hawkish Israelis as a moderating force whose insistence on military withdrawals will aid Hamas in its guerrilla warfare.

The Palestinian group has taken to digging Viet Cong-style 'terror tunnels' in order to gain quick access to targets in areas of Hamas controlled by Israel.

President Barack Obama on Sunday urged Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to agree to an 'immediate, unconditional humanitarian cease-fire' with Hamas.

'Dismayed': National Security Adviser Susan Rice gently defended Secretary of State John Kerry against charges from inside the Israeli government that his cease-fire proposal favored the Palestinian terror group Hamas

Ambassador Ron Dermer of Israel spoke at a National Leadership Assembly for Israel, saying it was 'unwarranted' to attack Kerry

The heads of state spoke following Israel's rejection Friday of a new cease-fire agreement with 
Hamas negotiated by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry.

Ron Dermer, Tel Aviv's ambassador to 
Washington, was even more measured in his language on Monday than Rice was, appearing at the same
 National Press Club event.

'Israel appreciates that President Obama, Secretary Kerry, and National Security Adviser Susan Rice, who is here today, have strongly supported Israel’s right to defend itself,' said Dermer.

'We also appreciate their efforts to help achieve a sustainable cease-fire.'

'I speak directly for my Prime Minister here,' he said. 'The criticism of Secretary Kerry for his good faith efforts to advance a sustainable cease-fire is unwarranted.'

Dermer and Rice spoke alongside House Speaker John Boehner, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, and the leaders of major Jewish advocacy groups. The Conference of Presidents of 
Major American Jewish Organizations and the Jewish Federations of North 
America hosted the event.

After Kerry's cease-fire bid fell apart last week, an Israeli news report quoted 'voices' from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet describing Kerry as 'completely capitulating' to Hamas and 'negligent.'

One top Israeli journalist compared Kerry to a space alien.

Those characterizations had the White House 'fuming' on Monday, according to the Associated Press.

In a post on liberal news publication Haaretz's website over the weekend, diplomatic correspondent Barack Ravid said Kerry did more to 'thwart the possibility of reaching a cease-fire in Gaza' than he did to promote one.

He went on to say Kerry would be 'responsible for every additional drop of blood that is spilled' if his actions resulted in an escalation of Israeli military aggression.

'Kerry isn’t anti-Israeli; on the contrary, he’s a true friend to Israel,' Ravid wrote. 'But his conduct in recent days over the Gaza cease-fire raises serious doubts over his judgment and perception of regional events.

'It’s as if he isn’t the foreign minister of the world’s most powerful nation, but an alien, who just disembarked his spaceship in the Mideast.'

Fighting resumed between Israel and Hamas on Sunday morning as the clock ran out on a temporary cease-fire that put the nearly three weeks old armed conflict on hold for a half day.

Appearing on CNN's 'State of the Union' program on Sunday morning, Netanyahu reaffirmed his country's refusal of Hamas' ultimatum and chastised his enemies' violation of previously agreed upon cease-fires.

'Israel is doing what any country would do, and certainly what the U.S. would do,' Netanyahu said.

The White House said Obama called the Israeli Prime Minster that afternoon and told him 'ultimately' a long-term solution 'must ensure the disarmament
 of terrorist groups and the demilitarization of Gaza.'

However, the White House said Obama shared the administration's 'serious and growing concern about the rising number of Palestinian civilian deaths and the loss of Israeli lives, as well as the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza.'

As of Sunday, more than a thousand Palestinians had been killed in the conflict and up to 6,000 others had been injured, according to AP. Nearly four dozen Israeli soldiers and three civilians and three civilians have also been killed.

In excerpts of an interview with Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal that aired Sunday and Monday on CBS, Meshaal told Charlie Rose that  'the world has two choices' – to help Hamas 'peacefully' remove Israel from the West Bank and the Gaza strip or 'we will expel this occupation from our land.'

'We are not fanatics. We are not fundamentalists. We do not, actually, fight the Jews because they are Jews per se – we fight the occupiers,' he said.

Hamas will keep fighting the 'occupiers,' he said, until it is victorious.

'I
 can die because of Israel. I cannot live under the occupation. The 
occupation is the worst thing that you can ever imagine,' he said. 'So 
every single Palestinian can die for the next generations to live in 
peace and freedom.'

Mashaal
 danced around whether Hamas would 'coexist with the state of Israel' if
 Palestine had its own state before telling Rose, 'When we have a 
Palestinian state, then the Palestinian state will decide on its 
policies,' adding that the 'Palestinian people can have their say, when 
they have their own state, without occupation.'

United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon said today that both Netanyahu and Mashaal
 were 'morally wrong' for allowing the death and destruction to continue
 and the two men need to show 'compassionate leadership' by ending the 
armed conflict.

He joined Obama and the U.N. Security Council in calling for 'an 
immediate and unconditional humanitarian cease-fire,' saying that 'Gaza 
is in critical condition.'

Ban also said Israel's retaliation against Hamas raises 'serious questions about proportionality.'

His
 statement follows a U.N. Human Rights Council resolution last week 
approving an international investigation into Israel for potential war 
crimes in Gaza.

U.S.
 Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican, said on Sunday that he would 
'condemn' the report because it places the blame for the conflict on 
Israel.

'The U.N. Human Rights report is a joke,' Graham said in comments reported by Politico. 'The U.N. is becoming anti-Israeli, anti-Semitic.'

Throughout Israel it was Secretary Kerry who was the subject of mockery in weekend commentary.

Maariv columnist Ben Caspit called Kerry 'an ongoing embarrassment, with the characteristics of a snowball.'

'The further he rolls, the greater the embarrassment,' Caspit said.

Israeli TV reporter Udi Segal ran a report citing government officials who framed Kerry as 'incapable of handling the most basic matters.'

The Associated Press said Monday that Obama administration officials said on background that by ridiculing Kerry, Israeli ministers 'crossed a line' and relations between Israel and the U.S. may never be as close as it once was as a result.

In on the record comments Deputy National Security Adviser Tony Blinken came to Kerry's defense.

'Israel has no better friend, no stronger defender than John Kerry,' he told AP.

The comments about Kerry are 'people leaking things that are either misinformed, or attempting to misinform,' he claimed.
