A mother who starved her four young 
sons and kept them in a filthy Denver apartment covered in feces could 
spend up to seven years in prison after pleading guilty Friday to her 
second offense of child abuse.

Prosecutors
 said the case involving Lorinda Bailey, 36, was among the most horrific
 they had ever seen, but the state's child abuse laws kept them from 
pursuing harsher penalties because the children, ages 2 to 6, did not 
suffer serious physical injuries.

Six other charges were dropped in exchange for Bailey's guilty plea to a single felony count.

'The way the child abuse statue reads,
 this was a disposition we thought would hold her accountable as best we
 could under the law,' said Lynn Kimbrough, a spokeswoman for the Denver
 District Attorney's Office.

Police say Bailey and the boy's father, Wayne Sperling, 66, kept their sons in an home filled with cat excrement and buzzing with flies.

The
 children were not potty-trained and could communicate only in grunts 
when authorities removed them from the home in October.

They were 
alerted by an emergency room doctor, who noticed that the youngest boy 
was unwashed, reeked of cigarette smoke and had bruises consistent with 
pinching.

Doctors couldn’t find any medical records at all for the five-year-old.

'Sick': In 2006, Bailey's children were found covered in dirt and hungry after neighbors saw them playing in the road. She and Sperling were put on probation and ordered to take parenting classes

Monstrous: Officials said that Bailey and Sperling's treatment of their children was the worst case of abuse they have every seen

Sperling
 told investigators he was the primary guardian for the boys. Bailey 
said she was living in another apartment in the same building but
 saw the boys most days.

The elderly father has 
pleaded not guilty and faces a hearing in October. Bailey remains 
free on bond pending her sentencing.

Neighbors
 said they previously called social services with concerns about the 
family, but the agency would not publicly discuss the case for 
confidentiality reasons.

The couple lost custody of other children amid similar allegations.

Officers
 found rotten food, trash and insects in the apartment in October 2006, 
after passers-by reported two young children playing in the street. The 
children mostly grunted and pointed to communicate.

Bailey and Sperling pleaded guilty in June 2007 to misdemeanor child abuse and lost custody of their three oldest children.

The latest case warranted felony charges because it was a repeat child abuse offense, Kimbrough said.

The four boys are now improving in foster care and living together, she said.
