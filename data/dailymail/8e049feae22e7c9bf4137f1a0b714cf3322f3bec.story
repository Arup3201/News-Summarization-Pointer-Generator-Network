A couple who are obsessed with aeroplanes have spent £40,000 turning the upstairs of their terraced home into an exact replica of a Boeing 737.

Steve and Vicky Everson, from Bacup, Lancashire, transformed the first floor of their house into an aeroplane complete with a cockpit and flight deck.

Their passion for aviation started around five years ago after they redesigned the spare room at their former home in Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, into a flight simulator.

Steve Everson, 42, who works as a broadcast engineer, said: 'Everyone thinks we're a bit eccentric, but you have to do what makes you happy'

The aeroplane-obsessed duo, who even tied the knot in a Concorde four years ago, regularly get interest from passengers wanting to try out their indoor-simulator

However, when they decided to move to
 Lancashire, they were forced to take it apart piece by piece and move 
it the 180 miles north.

They
 then carefully put it back together again in their two up two down home
 and it was so big it stretched from one side of the house to the other.

While the downstairs of their house remains completely as normal, half of the upstairs - including the entire spare bedroom and part of the bathroom - have been converted into the aviation room. Despite the actual bath and toilet staying intact, the couple had to cut a door in the bathroom door to allow access to the unique flightdeck.

indoor-simulator.

Steve,
 42, who works as a broadcast engineer, said: ‘Everyone thinks we're a 
bit eccentric, but you have to do what makes you happy.

‘It's exactly what we've always wanted, having a cockpit upstairs isn't everyone's dream.

‘But we've both been fascinated with aeroplanes from an early age - going to air shows, plane spotting and so on.

The project has become so big, to include a real-life simulator with entry door, left, and a departure entrance and lounge, right, that they are having to move the entire flightdeck piece by piece to an industrial unit two minutes down the road from their home

The aviation room is extraordinary and shows the couple have paid special attention to detail to make it an exact replica

‘People think it's brilliant and all our friends come round to have a play, or a tour and now more and more people want to join in.’

Steve and postwoman Vicky, 32, have scoured scrap yards, eBay and auction houses to build the Boeing replica.

They have since expanded the original cockpit to include a 12-seater cabin, airbridge and departure lounge.

The aviation room is now so large, the couple have been forced to move it to a nearby industrial unit two minutes down the road.

The couple have spent the last four to five years building the indoor Boeing 737, left. They have now opened it up to members of the public who can ride for just £75, right

Steve said: ‘I've learned a lot of things from doing this - new skills with my hands and also how to find my way around online shopping.

‘With all the bargains out there we've managed to construct a multi-million pound creation for thousands.

‘But we've have to make the decision to move it out and we're now going to have more room and plenty of space to have people enjoy it.

Commercial: The couple are now opening up their dream indoor-aeroplane to members of the public who can be 'passengers' and glide around the world without leaving the ground for as little as £75

‘You never know it might turn into a full plane.’

The couple are now opening up their dream indoor-aeroplane to members of the public who can be ‘passengers’ and glide around the world without leaving the ground for as little as £75.

The Flightdeck Experience simulator allows pilots to take off from London Heathrow and fly to dozens of worldwide locations including New York, Hong Kong and Parma de Mallorca.
