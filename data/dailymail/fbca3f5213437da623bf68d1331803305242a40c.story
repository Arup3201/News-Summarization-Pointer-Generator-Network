While Real Madrid president Florentino Perez unveiled £60million signing James Rodriguez to the club's adoring fans at the Santiago Bernabeu, his new team-mates continued their pre-season preparations in the sweltering US sun.

Gareth Bale was among the Madrid players that looked to be struggling in California, as Carlo Ancelotti led a session at UCLA.

With Cristiano Ronaldo still yet to join up with the side,
the Welsh winger was the main attraction at training on Tuesday, following his
sensational first season in Spain.
