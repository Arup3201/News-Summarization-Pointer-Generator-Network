As he worked the room at a swanky cocktail party for the great and the good in Colorado over the weekend, Prince Harry was handed a glass of Pimm’s by a waiter.

Eyeing his drink, a smiling Harry innocently told a fellow guest: ‘I didn’t realise you had Pimm’s in America.’

Quick as a flash, his principal private secretary, Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, moved in and spirited the glass away. It was a telling vignette.

With those naked pictures of Harry in Las Vegas – taken during a drunken game of strip billiards – still fresh in the memory, courtiers are anxious that he jettisons his ‘party prince’ image on his current week-long official tour of America.

Being photographed clutching a glass of alcohol does not sit well with this picture of the new, mature Harry.

No wonder, perhaps, one stateside newspaper has cheekily christened the trip ‘The Rehab Tour’.

In truth, however, Harry seems to be doing a perfectly good job of charming the pants off America without the help of his royal image-makers.

Already, the 28-year-old prince has managed to turn First Lady Michelle Obama – who Harry privately describes as ‘a very cool lady’ – into something resembling a giggling teenager during a hugely successful visit to the White House.

Meanwhile, amid scenes of pop star-like hysteria, the world’s most eligible bachelor was greeted by 500 screaming girls when he paid a visit to the Senate in Washington for an event to publicise the HALO Trust, the landmine charity supported by his late mother Princess Diana.

The prince has also won many admirers across the pond for his quiet dignity during a sombre wreath-laying ceremony at the Arlington military cemetery.

He was similarly impressive as, in his combat fatigues, he displayed the genuine empathy and warmth that comes so naturally to him when meeting severely injured servicemen at a rehabilitation centre in Maryland.

Later, he gamely got stuck in during a game of volleyball with wounded soldiers at the Warrior Games, a sports event for injured servicemen in Colorado Springs.

Prince Harry found himself sitting on the floor during the match, before being chased Benny Hill-style round the court by US Olympic gold medal-winning beach volleyballer Misty May-Treanor.

Army medic Stacey Byrne, 26, who was injured in Afghanistan in 2007, said: ‘It was a good first effort, but it would have been better if he had stayed on his bum for longer.

‘It would be great if he could take it up as a sport.’

Harry called for the Warrior Games to be brought to Britain and said he couldn’t think of a better use for the Olympic Stadium in London.

He said: ‘I only hope in the future, the near future, we can bring the Warrior Games to Britain and continue to enlarge this fantastic cause.

‘I don’t see how it wouldn’t be possible to fill a stadium with 80,000 people, not to watch Olympics, not to watch Paralympics, but to watch wounded servicemen fight it out amongst each other – not on a battlefield but in a stadium.’

Tomorrow, Harry is due to ride into New York on an iconic Routemaster London bus to plug a British government drive to promote Britain as a place to live, work and, above all, invest in.

And a planned polo match featuring Harry this Wednesday in wealthy Greenwich, Connecticut – hosted by billionaire Peter Brant and his supermodel wife Stephanie Seymour in aid of the prince’s African charity – has become the hottest ticket for years.

All in all, Harrymania has well and truly hit the States.

And suddenly his rather childish high-jinks at his £5,000-a-night suite in Sin City last summer seem a long time ago. Could it be that Harry, who had teenage brushes with cannabis, brawls with photographers outside nightclubs and once donned a Nazi outfit for a fancy dress party, is finally growing up?

If so, the transformation could hardly come at a more welcome time with the Queen’s recent announcement that she is scaling back on commitments that involve long-haul travel.

Privately, Apache helicopter pilot Harry says he expects increasingly to fill his grandmother’s shoes on official trips to foreign shores, though he is adamant he will keep ‘one foot in the Army Air Corps and one foot in the Royal world’.

Sir Peter Westmacott, the British ambassador to the US, speaks glowingly about Harry’s maturity and the way he has stepped up to the job this week.

And the simple truth is that others in the Royal Family, including his brother William, can only look on with admiration and, occasionally, envy at the apparently effortless way Harry wows everyone from maimed soldiers to titans of big business.

The only lingering question is whether Harry’s self-destructive impulses will trip him up again. Certainly, the five-strong team travelling with him on this long-planned trip are rubbing their hands together in glee at its unalloyed success thus far, but there is still the unspoken fear that Harry is never far away from another mishap.

Significantly, although Harry publicly professed he let his family down over the naked pictures furore last August, he remains privately unrepentant, complaining that he sees no tension between his growing official role and his insistence on letting his hair down once he is off-duty.

And even as he approaches his 30th birthday next year, Harry remains prone to occasional outbursts of petulance that do not sit well with the more mature image his advisers are seeking to foster.

A rather ill-tempered television interview after he arrived back from a 20-week tour of duty in Afghanistan in January, in which he moaned that he never wanted to give up being a foot soldier on patrol to fly helicopters, and complained he was ‘gawped’ at by fellow soldiers during mealtimes at Camp Bastion, made him sound spoilt.

He also ill-advisedly let slip that he had killed Taliban fighters in his role as a helicopter gunner, raising fears among his advisers that this could make him a terrorist target.

But increasingly, he is keen to display a more thoughtful image.

Harry even proved himself to be a chip off the old block by upbraiding the female chief executive of a renewable energy company at a drinks reception hosted by the British consul in Colorado last week over the ‘visual impact’ of wind farms – a subject long close to the heart of his father Prince Charles, who once branded them ‘a horrendous blot on the landscape’.

This trip has been facilitated by Harry’s aide Lowther-Pinkerton, who has spent months planning the tour with the help of Sir David Manning, the former British ambassador to the US, who acts as the Prince’s unpaid adviser on foreign matters after the Queen asked him to throw a protective arm around her errant grandson. But the trip was very much Harry’s idea.

It is something of a swansong for Lowther-Pinkerton, a quietly intense man with an occasionally Goonish sense of humour, who is quitting the post to return to work in the private sector and to spend more time with his four young children at home in Suffolk.

The highly decorated former SAS soldier will be a sad loss to Harry who views Lowther-Pinkerton as sort of father-confessor. Joining Harry in America this week is Lowther-Pinkerton’s replacement as his Private Secretary, Edward Lane Fox, a former officer in the Blues and Royals who is a distant relative of Baroness Martha Lane Fox, the internet businesswoman; and Harry’s new press secretary, Ed Perkins, who hitherto had the unenviable job as PR man to the gaffe-prone Prince Andrew.

Quite patently Harry is a much easier sell than his uncle. Indeed, his polished performance in the States has helped dispel fears, once expressed by senior members of the royal household, that he was going down the ‘Prince Andrew route’ and risked being seen as a rather pointless ‘spare’ to his brother’s ‘heir’.

Certainly, this is just the sort of trip, which is partly about boosting British business and investment, that would have gone completely ignored if it had been Andrew rather than Harry pressing the flesh.

And for all his impetuousness, Harry, who is dating dance student Cressida Bonas, is undoubtedly a breath of fresh air when set against the usual starched formality of the royals on tour.

By way of illustrating the point, he is travelling without a valet or equerry and is getting his own clothes ready for his busy list of official functions in America (something his father or, for that matter, Andrew, would find unthinkable).

And he flew across the Atlantic on a commercial flight, albeit in the Upper Class section of a Virgin jet. Even so, alongside the genuinely warm welcome he has received across the pond, there are cynical voices in the US media who think the new, responsible Harry is rather too good to be true.

The New York Post sniffily asked its readers: ‘Can Dirty Harry really clean up his image?’

He has also unfairly come in for flak for supposedly using his planned visit to victims of Hurricane Sandy in New Jersey tomorrow as a PR ploy.

‘Prince Harry has quite an agenda to clean up his act,’ says Manhattan rebranding expert Leslie Singer.

‘But the US is the global thermometer of what’s in and what’s out. If the Americans love him and can forgive him, then hopefully everyone else will too.’

The only question now for the new responsible Harry is whether he can ride this wave of popularity without shooting himself in the foot again.
