Serious: Attorney General Dominic Grieve told the Court of Appeals that the initial sentences handed to the four men 'did not reflect the seriousness of the offences'

Four members of a traveller family who kept vulnerable drug addicts and alcoholics and forced them to work should be given longer sentences, the Attorney General said today.

Dominic Grieve urged appeal judges to impose harsher sentences on the group who were found guilty after treating the men like slaves, subjecting them to beatings and leaving them to scavenge food from dustbins.

Mr Grieve, who is the Government's principal legal adviser, told the Court of Appeal in London that judges should increase the jail terms given to William Connors, 52, his sons John Connors, 29, and James Connors, 20, and son-in-law Miles Connors, 24.

The four men were jailed after being convicted of conspiracy to compel people to carry out forced labour by a jury at Bristol Crown Court in December, having pleaded not guilty.

He told the court that the sentences 'did not reflect the seriousness of the offences'.

Mr Grieve also said that tougher sentences would serve as a deterrent.

William Connors, known as 'Big Boss' was handed a six-and-a-half year jail term by judge Michael Longman. 

John Connors was given a four-year term, James Connors a three-year term in a young offenders' institution and Miles Connors a three-year term.

Mr Grieve, who is a senior barrister and the Conservative MP for Beaconsfield, said: 'At the end of the day the sentences imposed appear to use to have been too light.'

Sentences: Brothers John (left) and James (right), sons of John Connors, were given a four-year term and a three-year term in a young offenders' institute respectively

Lawyers representing the men disagreed and told judges that the sentences imposed were not 'unduly lenient'.

The three judges - Lord Judge, the Lord Chief Justice, Mr Justice Simon and Mr Justice Irwin - will announce their decision at a later date.

Trial jurors had been told how the Connors family had a private workforce made up of men who were were homeless drifters or addicts.

Prosecutors said workers forced to work for as little as £5 a day and were given alcohol and cannabis.

The Victims lived in squalid caravans on traveller sites as they moved around the country working on the Connors' paving and patio businesses, the trial heard.

One worker had a hosepipe shoved down his throat and the men were often made to strip for a 'hosing down' with freezing water.

The Connors family owned homes with hot tubs; a fleet of cars including a Rolls-Royce and a Mercedes saloon; enjoyed Caribbean cruises and holidays in Mexico and Dubai; and had £500,000 in the bank.

The Connors had also built up a property portfolio potentially worth millions of pounds.

During the trial, the family maintained that the men were 'free agents', with William and Mary claiming they were 'good Samaritans' providing the homeless with food, work and shelter.

William Connors wife, Mary, was given a jail term of two years and three months, which Mr Grieve did not challenge.
