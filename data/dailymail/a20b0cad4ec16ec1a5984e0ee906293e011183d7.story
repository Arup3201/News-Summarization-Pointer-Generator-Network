It brought satire to a generation by sending up Margaret Thatcher, John Major and the Royal Family - now Spitting Image is to turn its guns on a new batch of politicians and celebrities.

The cast and crew of the show which drew huge audiences in the 1980s and 1990s are being reunited to lampoon figures including Russell Brand, Vladimir Putin and Boris Johnson.

Promising a 'biting look at the world of politics and celebrity', ITV's six-part series, called Newzoids, will include impressions by Jon Culshaw, who worked on Spitting Image, as well as the voice of Debra Stephenson.

The original Spitting Image sent up a succession of political figures, including Prime Ministers Margaret Thatcher, who was portrayed wearing a man's suit, and John Major, whose puppet was painted grey

Among the targets for its satire are David Cameron and Nick Clegg, who will be portrayed appearing on the Jeremy Kyle show, Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Andy Murray.

Other famous faces that will be lampooned include Geordie duo Ant and Dec, Harry Styles and Simon Cowell.

The show is co-produced by Citrus Television, which was set up by another Spitting Image veteran Giles Pilbrow.

Pilbrow, who has also worked on animation 2DTV and CBBC's Horrible Histories, has said the new programme's aim is to 'amuse people' rather than 'bring down the government'.

Spitting Image ran for more than a decade and its puppet parodies and near-the-knuckle humour made it one of the most-watched shows of the 1980s and 1990s.

1 - The singles chart position the latex puppets held for three weeks in 1986 with The Chicken Song, a spoof of Black Lace’s Agadoo.

3 - People were needed to work each of the original puppets because they were so cumbersome.

40 - Puppets in all – including pop stars Mick Jagger, Paul McCartney and Bob Dylan – were made for the first series.

131 - Episodes of the show were made over 18 series.

350 - Puppets which were auctioned for £370,000 at Sotheby’s in 1999, including Sid James, which fetched £1,900.

Between 1984 and 1996 a regular audience of 15 million tuned in to watch the mockery of politicians, pop stars, sports personalities, religious figures and world leaders. The show won ten BAFTAs and two Emmys.

The show made the careers of people like Harry Enfield, Steve Coogan and Jan Ravens, who provided the voices, and Ian Hislop, Richard Curtis and Ben Elton, who wrote scripts.

Many puppets were auctioned. One Thatcher puppet sold for £10,200 and Cherie and Tony Blair went for £12,000. 

Newzoids will cost much less than the £250,000 each half-hour Spitting Image episode cost to produce, with advances in digital manipulation allowing lower-tech puppets to be used.

Speaking about the new show, ITV's director of entertainment Elaine Bedell said: 'ITV has a rich history of playing popular satirical comedy in peaktime on its main channel, and it seemed a good time to revive it this year.

'We are pleased to be adding to our growing comedy portfolio with this funny and biting look at the world of politics and celebrity.'

The new six-part show will appear on TV screens in the spring.

The team behind the new show includes Jon Culshaw - who worked on the original Spitting Image - and former Coronation Street actress Debra Stephenson, who both appeared  on The Impressions Show (pictured)

In its 12 years on our screens, Spitting Image mocked politicians from Westminster and around world, the Royals, sport stars, musicians and TV presenters.

Its most famous puppet was perhaps that of Margaret Thatcher, who wore a man’s suit in the show and treated her Cabinet with contempt.

One of the shows most famous moments was when, with the then-Tory cabinet around the dinner table, a waitress asked: ‘What about the vegetables?’ The model of Mrs Thatcher replies: 'Oh, they'll have the same as me.'

The Queen was often depicted wearing a head scarf and studying the horse racing pages of newspapers

Thatcher's successor, John Major, came in for equally merciless treatment, with his puppet painted grey to reflect his perceived dull personality.

In a further mocking of the Tory leader's perceived lack of charisma, some of the most famous scenes to feature him showed him and his wife, Norma, eating peas. Major would occasionally say: 'Nice peas, dear.'

The Royal Family were not spared the Spitting Image treatment. The Queen was habitually portrayed with a headscarf and CND badge and the Queen Mother carried a copy of the Racing Post and spoke with a Birmingham accent.

One of the most famous sketches to feature the Royals appeared after Prince William was born, when the Queen broke a bottle of champagne over his head to 'Christen him'.

International leaders also featured in the show; Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev’s distinctive birthmark on his head was shaped into a hammer and sickle while US President Ronald Reagan was shown in bed with two red call buttons at his side, one marked 'Nurse', the other 'Nuke'.

The puppet of Tony Blair became famous for its huge smile. The models of him and his wife, Cherie, sold for £12,000 at auction in 1999
