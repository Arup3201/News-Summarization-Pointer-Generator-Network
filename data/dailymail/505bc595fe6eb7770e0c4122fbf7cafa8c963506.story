American author David Gordon wrote a book called 'The Serialist' that made him a celebrity in Japan

One struggling author had no idea how big he was big in Japan--that is, until he went there and was met by a TV crew and put in a 'James Bond' style hotel.

New York based novelist David Gordon wrote a book called 'The Serialist' in 2010 which premiered in the United States and did moderately well. In Japan the book was a sensation.

Suddenly a Japanese translation came out and Gordon started winning Japanese literary contests.

Gordon wrote an essay for The New York Times in which he explains how he won all three major literary contests, something no one had done before, especially not an American.

Gordon had always been a fan of Japanese culture but had no idea he would be received so well there.

'It was like having a distant teenage crush on someone who suddenly wrote and said, “I like you, too,' wrote Gordon.

Gordon explains how his book was renamed 'Niryuu Shousetsuka' translates into, 'Second Rate Novelist' since the book is about a pulp fiction author.

Not only did Gordon's book win big among readers, Japan decided to help Gordon reach an even wider audience with a movie adaptation. The film called, 'Niryuu Shousetsuka: Serialist', is set in Tokyo with Japanese actors speaking Japanese.

Gordon quips in his essay at the fact that his book actually takes place in Queens and features non-Japanese people.

David Gordon's book 'The Serialist' was translated into Japanese and adapted into a film

In June of 2013, Gordon went to the premiere of his film and he also released a new book called 'Mystery Girl' at the the same time.

The book wouldn't be out in the United States until July. He explains how his life in Japan seemed to be moving ahead of his life in the United States. It was certainly more glamorous.

'In a daze, I was paraded before the press, blinded by flashbulbs and tracked by TV cameras. But because I couldn’t understand the directions, I often talked to the wrong camera, stared into space or even leaned on the scenery — until my intrepid and glamorous young translator told the reporters to wave if they wanted David-san to look at their cameras, like a baby at a birthday party,' wrote David.

He describes going to interviews, readings, and book signings. He says people applauded his ability to sign his name 'really big on a poster.'

David describes coming home from his trip and returning to his 'book-filled rooms' smaller than his hotel suite in Tokyo

'Don’t get me wrong, it’s fine, but once in a while, as I eat a burrito 
and watch an old samurai film, I wonder how that other, more glamorous 
writer, David-san, the Second-Rate Novelist, is doing over there, where 
it’s already tomorrow,' he concluded.

Gordon announced the exciting news about the film on his twitter account
