Sending billions in aid to poor countries is not always the most 'appropriate' way for the UK to help them, MPs warn.

The number of recipient states in dire need is falling and sending handouts to rapidly growing economies such as India is no longer a 'sufficient response', they say.

In a report published today, MPs call for reform to Britain's overseas aid programme, saying taxpayers' money would be better spent on 'co-operation'.

Sending billions in aid to poor countries is not always the most 'appropriate' way for the UK to help, according to MPs (pictured relief goods are unloaded in Pakistan)

Efforts should be diverted to 'beyond aid' projects – using UK expertise to encourage trade and helping to overhaul tax collection and public services such as health, schools and the justice systems.

The document, compiled by a cross-party group of MPs on the Commons international development committee, follows official figures that show the number of 'priority countries' has fallen from 28 to 22.

Although the report endorses the much-criticised target to allocate 0.7 per cent of Britain's GDP to poor countries, it calls for a 'new approach'.

Tanzania and Kenya (pictured), should be moving to 'beyond aid' programmes within five years, according to Jeremy Lefroy, a Tory MP on the committee

It says: 'The nature of international development is changing... aid remains essential for poor countries, and for some purposes in middle income countries. 

'However overall, a new approach is needed which reflects the changing situation. As grants of aid become less appropriate in some countries, so new forms of development co-operation are necessary.' 

The committee said aid remained vital for 'fragile' countries fighting infectious diseases such as ebola or those embroiled in conflict or humanitarian crises.

But it called for more focus on 'beyond aid' policies that address the underlying causes of poverty, a 'modest' investment in which has an impact 'much larger than can be brought about through aid'.

Such a move would benefit UK households, who pay about £430 a year towards overseas aid to countries including India – which last year received £169million despite having its own space programme.

Jeremy Lefroy, a Tory MP on the committee, said aid recipients such as Tanzania and Kenya, should be moving to 'beyond aid' programmes within five years.

He added: 'DfID must make sure that countries which no longer require our cash are instead benefiting from British expertise and helped to run their own public services.'

Committee chairman Sir Malcolm Bruce said aid has a role to play in 'building new partnerships' with emergent countries like India, China and Brazil. 'However the number of poor countries is falling, and those that remain often suffer from conflict, so need multiple interventions... that is why development in the future will not just be about aid,' he said.

The Department for International Development backed the committee's findings and said the Government needs to 'find new ways of working with emerging powers'.

A spokesman said it has already diverted funds away from traditional aid 'with the aim of ending aid dependency once and for all'. Many Tory MPs oppose the 0.7 per cent target and its link to GDP – national wealth – which led to an extra £1billion in aid added last year because of better than expected economic growth.
