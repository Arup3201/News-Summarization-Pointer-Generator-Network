A police officer who investigated a Zumba instructor's alleged prostitution business has testified that she found an 'assortment of condoms', four bottles of baby oil, cameras, a planner and $1,000 cash at the woman's residence.

Audra Presby took to the stand for the second day in the trial of Mark Strong, who is accused of promoting prostitution with business partner and Zumba teacher Alexis Wright in Kennebunk, Maine.

Presby testified she had also seized several 
computer hard drives, a laptop, checkbooks and personal lubricants from Wright's businesses, home and vehicle during a February 2012 search.

The discoveries were made during the prostitution investigation, to which Presby was assigned in October 2011 following complaint of suspicious activity at Wright's Pura Vida Zumba 
studio.

While Presby initially failed to make any discoveries of suspicious activity, she carried out internet searches and came across a blog that caught her attention, the Portland Press Herald reported.

'When I performed the online search, 
not only did I find this site, Sensual Body Works by Lydia, I also found... online sex videos of this individual,' Presby said.

Another agent called the number listed on the blog and posed as a client to ask whether an hour massage would get him sex. On the tape, which was played in the court, she responds: 'OK.'

Business: Police found lubricants, an assortment of condoms and baby oil in Wright's home and studio

Police continued to gather evidence and obtained and executed a search warrant
at Wright's Zumba studio, her business office,
her home in Wells and her vehicle where they found the items, she said.

Wright also had a
badge and state identification as an assistant investigator in her possession, which she 
had after studying under Strong to be a private investigator, his attorney said.

Presby also testified that she linked Strong to the case after seeing a sex
video of him and Wright and matching his face and voice to the video appearances.

Strong 
allegedly watched sexual encounters between Wright and her clients through a live computer webcam and 
spoke with Wright when the men were out of the 
room.

'I remember keeping the logs of the hours [spent watching sexually 
explicit evidence],' Presby said. 'I know at one point I was well over 80 hours, and by the 
end, I was closer to 120 hours.'

Not guilty: Mark Strong (right) admits he had an affair with Wright - but they argue he didn't know she was running an alleged 
prostitution business

Seductive: Mark Strong, a married father of two,
allegedly sat at his home computer and watched Alexis Wright have sex 
with several men via live-streaming video over Skype

Strong and his attorney have argued that 
Presby unfairly unfocused the investigation on him as revenge for research he had carried out into her alleged misconduct.

Strong has argued he was investigating Presby's 2009 affair with her married then-supervisor 
Nicholas Higgins, and allegations by Higgins' former 
wife that Presby had inappropriate sexual contact with the couple's five-year-old son, the Bangor Daily News reported.

Kennebunk police Lt. Daniel Jones testified earlier in the trial that a Maine State Police 
investigation into the accusations determined there was 'no criminal 
action' by Presby. But she was reprimanded for the affair.

The defense cross-examination of Presby was expected to last throughout the afternoon on Friday.

Strong, 57, of Thomaston, is on trial on 13 counts related to promotion of prostitution. Wright will be tried later.

Wright, a 30-year-old single mother, is slated to stand trial in May. She has pleaded not guilty to all charges

The insight from Presby comes after 
jurors were shown a video of Wright having sex with a 61-year-old man on
a massage table in exchange for $250, while Strong allegedly watched 
from his home computer via Skype.

The damning evidence, recorded by 
Wright herself on a camera hidden in a nest of lingerie, shows her 
negotiating a fee and then collecting a pile of cash after she finishes.

Prosecutors
argue that Strong was listening in and watching live via Skype during 
the entire encounter and later discussed booking other johns for Wright -
pushing her to sleep with three clients in one day instead of two.

In between clients, she discusses her
schedule of clients with a man who is watching through the video 
camera. Prosecutors say that man is Strong, according to Seacoast Online.

'I'd like to schedule only two one-hour appointments tomorrow instead of 45,' Wright says, talking to the camera.

Battle: Attorney Daniel Lilley, who is representing Strong, speaks in court in Alfred, Maine. He has conceded Strong might have watched her having sex but said he was not involved in prostitution

'Nice to get three in somehow,‚Äù the man's voice says.

When Wright says that she has 'school' the next day, the man suggests she 'fit three in today.'

Wright says that would be 'pushing it.'

The man's voice later asks which clients he should try to book for her.

The time stamp on the 36-minute video
shown the jurors, which was seized from Wright's home, corresponds with
the time on 45 Skype video screen shots that were downloaded from Strong's computer, an investigator testified.

Seacoast Online reports that in other videos, the pair discuss rates and sexual services that Wright offers.

Strong, a married father of two, says he funded Wright's exercise
studio with a loan and acted as her business partner.

On trial: Strong has pleaded not guilty to 12 charges of promoting prostitution and one count of invasion of privacy

He
also admits that he had an affair with her and his lawyers concede that
he may have watched her online as she had sex with other men.

However, his
lawyers argue Strong, a local real estate broker and private 
investigator, had no idea Wright was allegedly receiving money for the 
sex or that she was running a prostitution business.

Prosecutors say the video shows that 
Strong not only knew Wright was having sex for money, he was helping her
book and schedule johns.

Jurors also saw a video of the 
alleged Zumba prostitute dropping her towel and posing naked in front of
the windows of her Maine exercise studio.

Jurors also saw about two dozen pictures Strong
captured on his home computer while he watched live Skype broadcasts of
Wright allegedly having sex with johns in her Zumba exercise studio.

Detectives say they recovered 13,000 
still images from Strong's computer, many of them sexually explicit 
pictures that he captured from videos of Wright having sex with alleged 
johns.

Wright's alleged clients include wealthy and well-known figures in southern Maine. So far, 18 men have pleaded guilty to paying Wright for sex

On Wednesday, Justice Nancy Mills ruled 
that the prosecution should show only 100 of the photos to the jury - to
illustrate the Wright invited multiple men into her studio for sex on 
multiple occasions.

Prosecutors initially wanted to show 577 to the jury.

Defense lawyers strenuously objected before the material was introduced and continued to object after jurors saw the video and the pictures. They say Strong is just a 'voyeur.'

'It
may be Mr. Strong observed the sexual acts of Ms. Wright with other 
people, but I don't think it shows promotion of prostitution,' Daniel 
Lilley told the judge. 'These are all very sexual acts and very sexual positions.'

Wright has pleaded not guilty to charges of prostitution and invasion of privacy. Her trial is scheduled for May.
