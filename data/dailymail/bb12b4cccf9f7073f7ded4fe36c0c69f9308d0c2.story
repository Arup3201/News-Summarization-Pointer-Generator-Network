Warning: Sir David Manning has told David Cameron that leaving the EU would condemn Britain to 'irrelevance' on the world stage

One of Prince William’s key advisers has warned David Cameron that leaving the EU would condemn Britain to ‘irrelevance’ on the world stage.

Sir David Manning, who briefed Tony Blair over the Iraq War, accompanies the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on overseas tours advising on foreign policy.

But in a move that could put the Royal Family on a collision course with the Government, Sir David has challenged Mr Cameron’s willingness to put Britain’s place in the EU up for grabs.

The Prime Minister has pledged to renegotiate the UK’s relationship with Brussels and then  hold an in-out referendum by the end of 2017. Mr Cameron has made clear that if he does not  get a good deal he is prepared  to campaign for Britain to leave  the EU. Yesterday he warned  that public support for the EU is ‘wafer thin’.

But in a submission to the Government’s EU review, Sir David – a former British ambassador in Washington – warned that pulling out would undermine Britain’s standing with its allies.

He wrote: ‘Outside the EU, our influence in Europe would be sharply diminished – but so it would be in the United States. The risk to the UK of leaving the European Union is of a rapid drift into international irrelevance.

‘Compelling economic arguments are made for the UK’s membership of the European Union, not least the importance of the single market in which we do almost half our trade.

‘But equally compelling are  the strategic, security and diplomatic interests served by UK membership, interests that would be seriously jeopardised were we to leave the EU.’

He claimed that America looks to the EU as its ‘natural partner’ and believes that Britain’s role is enhanced as a member. But  President Obama has already given his tentative approval to Mr Cameron’s plans.

The comments come after the Daily Mail revealed how a Foreign Office report – saying EU membership was beneficial – was branded a whitewash by critics.

Yesterday, Mr Cameron insisted that Britain will win a new deal  in the EU because countries in the euro need to become ‘more integrated’ to solve their economic problems. He said: ‘I’m saying, ‘‘You need to sort your stuff out – and we’ll allow you to do that because you need to.” But at the same time those countries like Britain where, frankly, consent for the EU is wafer thin, we need changes too.’

Settling the issue: David Cameron, pictured at the Bentley factory in Crewe, says a referendum would solve the EU issue for a generation

Speaking at a question and answer session in Crewe, he added: ‘I believe we can achieve a better settlement for Britain in Europe and then put that to the people in a referendum in 2017. I believe we’d be able to settle this issue for a generation.’

Sir David was at Mr Blair’s side in the run-up to the Iraq War in 2003 as his chief foreign policy adviser and gave evidence to the Chilcot Inquiry. He revealed that Mr Blair drew up secret plans for the invasion nine months before the outbreak of war.

But he urged caution on Mr Blair, telling the inquiry that he thought Britain should not have gone to war without a second UN resolution and that weapons inspectors should have ‘been given longer’ to search for WMD.

He also expressed doubts that the war was worth the cost in ‘blood and treasure’.

Sir David’s views are significant since he has acted as an unpaid adviser on foreign affairs to Prince William and the Duchess of Cambridge since 2009.

Leading Eurosceptic Tory MP Peter Bone last night urged Prince William to seek advice from a broader range of advisers. He said: ‘Sir David has provided the establishment view, which is palpable nonsense and totally out of touch with what ordinary people think.

‘They want us to be a small part of a European superstate, but we’ll be a more important country in the world if we are an independent country with our own foreign policy.

‘I hope royalty from the Queen down will listen to a range of views and realise what ordinary people are saying.’
