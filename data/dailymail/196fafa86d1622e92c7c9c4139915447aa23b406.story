Steve Wright's weekly BBC 2 programme has been ruled to have breached the corporation's guidelines

It is the gentle Sunday morning radio show that encourages its listeners to phone in with heartfelt dedications for their loved ones.

But fans of Steve Wright’s weekly BBC 2 programme were surprised to discover their romantic messages were not getting through…because it was pre-recorded.

Sunday Love Songs has been ruled to have breached the corporation’s guidelines by failing to explain music requests made during the show would not be broadcast the same day.

The audience was told to phone in ‘any time’ with romantic song choices and messages, without an explanation the show’s script was finalised three days earlier.

It meant some listeners wasted time and money on calls when their requests had already missed the cut off point.

They also spent time listening for their messages when there was no chance they would be included on the show, broadcast between 9am and 11am every Sunday.

The BBC Trust’s editorial standards committee said the failure to inform listeners properly breached guidelines on accuracy and interacting with the audience.

It upheld a complaint by a listener who only discovered the show was not live when it was announced a reference to entertainer Andy Williams had been recorded before his death.

The show is recorded on Fridays, but the playlist and script are decided each Thursday, meaning requests made after that point could not be considered for the next show.

An answerphone message to callers only made this clear after they had already left a request.

The BBC amended the on-air and phone messages to make it clear dedications would be considered for future programmes rather than the one being broadcast at the time of the call.

But the committee ruled the updated message still breached accuracy guidelines because it was not made clear requests would have to be made before the Thursday deadline to be included in the Sunday show.

The committee found the fact the show was presented ‘as live’ despite being pre-recorded was not a breach of editorial guidelines. It added the BBC did not intentionally mislead its audience, saying: ‘the problem was essentially one of clarity.’

A BBC spokesman said: ‘In light of the Trust’s findings on clarity for people leaving dedications for the programme, we have revised the wording in order to ensure the process is absolutely clear for listeners.’

Steve Wright is best known for presenting Radio 1’s Steve Wright in the Afternoon The veteran DJ, 58, moved to Radio 2 in 1996.
