'Significant impact': Society heiress Miss Ecclestone was said to be shaken by the alleged blackmail which the court heard has had a 'significant impact in her home and working life'

A false teeth technician threatened to kidnap Tamara Ecclestone in an 'amateurish' plot to extort £900,000 from her Formula One boss father Bernie, a court heard.

Martin Peckham, 41, is accused of making his demands during a string of phone calls to the billionaire racing tycoon.

Society heiress Miss Ecclestone was said to be shaken by the alleged blackmail which the court heard has had a 'significant impact in her home and working life'

Prosecutor Philip Lemoine said: 'This was a crudely-executed, perhaps not frivolous but rather amateurish, attempt to obtain money from Mr Ecclestone.'Amateurish it might have been, but it was a targeted offence. The family is vulnerable and Mr Ecclestone took it seriously.'

However, while he is accused of masterminding the scheme, no money ever changed hands.

Divorced father of two Mr Peckham, who works as a denture technician by day, 
appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Friday to hear the 
charges.

Wearing khaki shorts and a black polo shirt, he spoke only to confirm his name and address, The Sun reported.

He was bailed until this coming Friday when he will face judges at Southwark Crown Court.

Imposing conditions on his bond, Judge Justin Barron told his he would have to adhere to a strict nighttime curfew at his home in Chelmsford, Essex, and was forbidden to contact any member of the Ecclestone family.

Judge Barron told him: 'If you do attempt to contact them in any way, directly or through another person, by email or phoning them up, you’ll be 
in breach of your bail and be brought back to custody.'

In an unrelated case, Miss Ecclestone is
already due to testify against two men accused of attempting to 
blackmail her for a six-figure sum by threatening to reveal details of 
her sex life.

Derek Rose, 32, and Jakir Uddin, 19, deny the allegations and will face a trial 
in February.

It is alleged that the pair who were arrested in April demanded cash from her in order not to reveal details of a relationship.

They
are said to have sent her agent Dana Malmstrom a warning they would 
release the story to the press unless the cash was handed over.

Bernie Ecclestone is estimated to be 
worth £2.5 billion, and Miss Ecclestone recently appeared in a 
three-part Channel 5 show documenting her lifestyle.
