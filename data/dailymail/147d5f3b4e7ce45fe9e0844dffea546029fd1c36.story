Beyonce, Nicki Minaj and Lady Gaga are pop's poster girls well known for their penchant for glossy, highlighted and sometimes even rainbow locks, bronzed skin and perfect feline flicks.

But it seems the trio have ditched their make-up bags and are fully embracing the SS14 'make-under' trend that dominated the catwalks this season.

Nicki Minaj wowed at the MTV Movie Awards on Sunday with a more pared-back look than we are accustomed to. Beyonce, meanwhile, sported minimal make-up and wore her hair au natural when she joined sister Solange at Coachella this weekend and Lady Gaga stripped off her much-loved heavy make-up for a friend's wedding.

Rise of the make-under: Nicki Minaj shocked when she swapped her favoured eccentric look (right) for a more pared-back and natural look on Sunday night's MTV Movie Awards - and it seems she's leading a hot new celebrity trend

Nicki, who once favoured huge false eyelashes and bright dip-dye hair, is trailblazing the more sophisticated and natural trend.

Writing on Grazia Daily, Kate Lloyd says: 'It's the latest sign that 
Nicki's decided to switch to a more grown-up look.

'The singer who used 
to shock in her videos on the red carpet with multi-coloured wigs and 
skimpy hemlines has been little-by-little paring down her image over the
 past year. She even shared a no-makeup selfie on Instagram last month.

'It
 seems for stars known for their outlandish looks, the best way to make a
 statement is to ditch the cartoon-like image.'

Beauty blogger Charlie Lankston said: 'It’s amazing to see Nicki in something of a new light. Using make-up is all about being creative and expressing yourself and I think it’s great that she is showing us another side to her character through a more natural look.

'I don’t know if she’s necessarily trying to shock or rebel but rather just prove that she’s got more to offer than the bright colours and wild hairstyles.

Has she gone ga-ga? Lady Gaga ditched her heavy make-up look and looks flawless in the process

'There always seems to be a move towards more bare-faced make-up during the spring and summer seasons and these ladies prove that SS14 is all about the new take on natural.'

While each season presents an updated take on 'natural' beauty, designers for SS14 sent their models out wearing near to no make-up at all.

Dubbed 'raw' beauty by all the make-up maestros backstage, a touch of concealer and swash of bronzer or blusher was used to highlight the skin rather than transform it.

Speaking about the fresh, contemporary look, stylist Guido Palau said: 'Doing as little as possible but still looking good is the most modern thing that you can do right now.'
