Hearing: Dr David Waghorn was struck off after being found guilty of misconduct after he was caught performing liposuction in basement clinic

A cosmetic surgeon has been struck off after he was found performing liposuction in a dirty Mayfair basement littered with blood-stained swabs and needles.

Dr David Waghorn, who had a clinic in Harley Street, was discovered operating in unhygienic conditions without proper safeguards during a spot check by inspectors.

He initially tried to stop them from entering the basement by padlocking the door but when he eventually did let them in they found him performing liposuction on a woman whose name, he said, he did not know.

The work surfaces were found littered with unsheathed needles, blood stained swabs and discarded latex gloves.

A panel at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service found Dr Waghorn had placed the patient at increased risk of infection.

A lack of monitoring and resuscitation equipment meant that there was an increased risk of death, it added.

Panel chairman Professor Stephen Miller said: ‘The panel is in no doubt that Dr Waghorn’s misconduct resulted in serious risks to a patient, undermined proper standards of professional behaviour and brought the profession into disrepute.’

Expert witness Professor Simon Kay said Dr Waghorn’s clinic was ‘one of the most egregious cases of stepping outside of every boundary’ that he had seen.

The hearing in Manchester heard that inspectors from the Care Quality Commission went to the clinic on Dover Street after receiving a tip off that another doctor was disposing of bodily waste.

Dr Waghorn's basement clinic was in London's famous Harley Street, but it was unregistered as a clinic

Dr Waghorn had rented the basement – which was unregistered for use as an operating clinic – because other registered premises were unavailable.

A woman in her 20s who was being treated at the time of the inspection became upset when she heard he should not have been performing the procedure on her. She fled the premises before being properly patched up.

Dr Waghorn later told investigators she was a ‘Jordanian woman’ who had visited him at his Harley Street clinic a few days earlier, but he didn’t know her name.

Finding him guilty of misconduct, Professor Miller said Dr Waghorn had been found to have a ‘cavalier approach’ to patient safety incompatible with working as a doctor. He was struck off the Medical Register with immediate effect.

Dr Waghorn has already been fined £2,500 under the Care Standards Act at Westminster Magistrates’ Court for his work at the basement clinic in March 2010.

He set up his own company offering cosmetic surgery procedures after he lost his job working at a private treatment centre in Plymouth.

His company, LipoSurgery, advertised it offered treatments in Harley Street, Mayfair and Weybridge.

The website stated: ‘Clients rave that our LipoSurgery liposuction procedures are painless and quick (Many patients even return to work on the next day).’
