A duck-hunting trip turned deadly on Saturday afternoon.

23-year-old Adam Earl Poole, and a friend were hunting in a channel between two lakes in northern Minnesota when they both stood up at the same time to shoot at ducks.

Mr Poole's hunting partner lost his balance while firing and accidentally shot him in the head with his shotgun.

'They both stood up in the boat in an effort to shoot at a duck,' a statement from the Sheriff’s Office read. 'The hunting partner lost his balance, and the shotgun he was carrying discharged.

Poole was struck in the head and died from his injuries.'

Authorities say they are treating Poole’s death strictly as an accident.

The Sheriff’s Office has not released the name of the hunting partner.

Adam and Allie: They were perfect for each other according to friends. They both loved the outdoors

Hunter: It's rare to find a photo where Adam hasn't caught something

First responders received a 911 call just before 5 p.m. but by the time they arrived Poole had died of his injuries.

The Ramsey County Medical Examiner will perform an autopsy but at this point Mr Poole's death appears to be a terrible accident.
