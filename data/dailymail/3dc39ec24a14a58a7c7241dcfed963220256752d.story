Comedian Freddie Starr has launched a £300,000 defamation claim against one of the women who exposed Jimmy Savile as a paedophile.

The 70-year-old claims that Karin Ward's allegations that he assaulted her nearly 40 years ago have cost him a small fortune in cancelled bookings.

Starr was arrested after cancer sufferer Miss Ward, 55, claimed on television that he groped her in Savile's dressing room after appearing on the shamed DJ's TV show Clunk Click in 1974 when she was 15.

Miss Ward's testimony against Savile was one of the key factors in triggering the investigation into his past.

She spoke on camera in the ITV documentary which first revealed Savile's abuse, focusing on how he preyed on her and fellow pupils at Duncroft approved school for girls in Staines, Surrey.

But Starr – who is furious that police have not decided whether to charge him – claims that her additional claims that he molested her are untrue and defamatory, and have cost him more than £300,000 in cancelled theatre bookings.

In a highly unusual case, he has lodged a legal claim at the High Court, detailing repeated occasions when he claims she blackened his name as a paedophile.

Starr was first arrested last November by the Operation Yewtree squad which is investigating claims of historic sexual abuse sparked by the Savile revelations.

He was rearrested in April over further allegations and last month police handed a file on his case to the Crown Prosecution Service.

In his claim, he maintains his innocence of all charges, describing himself as 'a famous comedian and entertainer who has been active in showbusiness for over 40 years'.

The father of five says Miss Ward's attacks on him began in the ITV documentary Exposure: The Other Side Of Jimmy Savile, which was broadcast in October 2012.

In it, she said: 'I was horribly, horribly humiliated by Freddie Starr, who had a very bad attack of wandering hands and had groped me, and I didn't like him because he smelled like my step-father and it frightened me and freaked me out, and I rebuffed him and he humiliated me in front of everyone in the dressing room.'

Starr, who lives near Studley, Warwickshire, denies any such sexual assault at the Clunk Click recording, humiliating or frightening her, or being a paedophile.

His claim also says Miss Ward was libelling him when she told a BBC journalist: 'Other guests on the show clearly saw girls and, well, kids, male and female, as being there to be used.

'I had a famous person who would try, he smelled awful, he smelled of sweat and alcohol and it made me heave just to be near him, so I certainly didn't want him to do anything to me.'

Starr also complains that Miss Ward published defamatory claims on an internet blog in which she wrote of visits with schoolmates to Savile's dressing room at the BBC over a period of several weeks.

She wrote she met a number of celebrities, saying: 'Of those who had similar tastes to Jimmy Savile – a liking of under-age girls – I can only recall vague disgust and  horror.

'One particular celebrity, a very popular comedian of the time, whom I shall simply refer to as “F”, absolutely stank of booze and sweat.

'His hands wandered incessantly – he had absolutely no qualms about any one of the girls seeing what he was doing to any of the others. The fact that we sat in his dressing room with him, drinking vodka or Bacardi rum whilst he blatantly selected which girl to humiliate amazes me.

'I refused "F" because getting anywhere near him made me heave.'

And in an autobiography produced to be read on Kindle-type devices, she said the comedian referred to as "F" 'was furious that I dared refuse him – he made an exceptionally cruel remark about my lack of breasts by way of getting back at me for refusing him.

'So that everyone could hear, he said loudly, "I wouldn't touch you anyway, you're a ***less wonder!". Everyone laughed whilst I burned with humiliation.'

Starr's claim says he is easily identifiable because he was a popular comedian with the initial F, and Miss Ward had already named him on TV. He denies encouraging under-age girls to drink alcohol while choosing which to humiliate.

He says he is due aggravated damages because Miss Ward sought a huge audience for her claims 'when, if there were any truth in her allegations, she should have reported them to the police'.

He also claims she had refused to retract or apologise for the claims, despite his public denials – and seeks an injunction barring her from slurring him in future.

Miss Ward, of Oswestry, Shropshire, was diagnosed with bowel cancer two years ago. She is a qualified legal secretary, but has rarely worked because of depression and anxiety. Last night, she could not be reached for comment.
