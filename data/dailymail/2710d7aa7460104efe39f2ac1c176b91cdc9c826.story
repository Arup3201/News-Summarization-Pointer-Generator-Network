The wait for Apple’s iPhone 6 is nearly over, according to the latest leak.

Promotional box art seems to confirm the announcement for Apple's next smartphone as being Tuesday 9 September.

And several other details - including the position of the volume buttons and the new location of the power button - have also been revealed.

A leading French blog says the iPhone 6 will be announced on Tues 9 Sept. The information comes from supposedly leaked box art of the device (left). On the right is the box art previously leaked by Steve Hemmerstoffer of nowhereelse.fr, which confirmed details on the iPhone 5S hours before it was announced

The leak reported by Forbes came from Steve Hemmerstoffer, editor of the leading French Apple blog nowhereelse.fr.

The handset is expected to be unveiled on Tuesday 9 September and will come in 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch sizes.

It is thought the phone could boast a flexible and scratch-proof sapphire screen, which is about to go into large-scale production in the US.

The screen is tipped to be ‘Retina display+’ with a 1,704x904 resolution.

Experts also predict a faster A8 processor, better rear-facing camera - possibly with changeable lenses -and wireless charging support.

It may also include a heart rate sensor like the Samsung Galaxy S5. 

Last year Hemmerstoffer unveiled details on the iPhone 5S hours before launch, lending some credibility to the leak.

He claims that the image of the box art was passed to him by a reliable Chinese source.

On the box a date showing the expected announcement date can be seen - Tuesday 9 September.

For the release of the iPhone 5S Apple had a similar design, displaying the date of the announcement on the box.

The artwork also shows the new shape of the volume buttons, eschewing the circular design on the iPhone 5S for a more rectangular look.

And the sleep and wake button has also been moved from the top of the phone to the right hand side.

As expected, the fingerprint sensor used to lock and unlock the phone returns, while the charging port of the iPhone 6 now comes in the form of a Lightning connector.

The source also apparently claimed that a 128GB version of the phone will be available.

This close-up of the box shows the rumoured features and release date of the iPhone 6. The 'Ring Silent switch' remains in the same place from the iPhone 5, but the volume buttons seem to have changed to a rectangular shape, while the power button has been moved. The date of the release is also supposedly shown

With the iPhone 6 launch two weeks away,  new images of leaked parts have been revealed on a near daily basis. Multiple images of both the front panel and the rear shell of the 4.7-inch device have surfaced, while this image seemingly shows the design of the entire device

easier to use because it will be reversible at both ends. Sonny

Last week it was reported that a last minute redesign of a key component had left Apple's suppliers scrambling to get enough screens ready for the iPhone 6.

Reuters claimed supply chain sources said the need to redesign a key component disrupted panel production ahead of next month's expected launch.

Earlier this month, leaked images were posted by Moscow designers Feld and Volk and claimed 
to show the rear shell (pictured) and an embedded logo, alongside a 
cable that is said to be used for the home button. The images are 
purported to be of the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 model

The issue 
highlights the risks and challenges that suppliers face to meet Apple's 
tough specifications, and comes on the heels of a separate screen 
technology problem, since resolved, in making thinner screens for the 
larger iPhone 6 model.

Two
 supply chain sources said display panel production suffered a setback 
after the backlight that helps illuminate the screen had to be revised, 
putting screen assembly on hold for part of June and July.

is scratchproof, and made of Liquidmetal alloy. Liquidmetal is a 
super-strong material that can be moulded into shape

One said Apple, aiming for the thinnest phone possible, initially wanted to cut back to a single layer of backlight film, instead of the standard two layers, for the 4.7-inch screen, which went into mass production ahead of the 5.5-inch version.

But the new configuration was not bright enough and the backlight was sent back to the drawing board to fit in the extra layer, costing precious time and temporarily idling some screen assembly operations, the source said. 

A patent, initially filed in 2012, describes a bayonet mount system for 
an iPhone camera (pictured). The protruding camera system is similar to that currently used
 on SLR cameras and lets photographers attach and remove interchangeable
 lenses using a twist and lock motion

Earlier this month another leak revealed a protruding camera - a feature that was first reported on in April - recessed volume controls, which were hinted at during the start of the month, and an embedded logo.

The images were purported to be of the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 model and were leaked by Russian designers Feld and Volk.

Synthetic sapphire is a hard, transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide, produced at high temperatures.

As the material is heated, it forms disks that can be sliced using diamond-coated saws.

These round disks are ground into shape, and polished, to become glass.

The technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin, super-strong and scratch resistant.

Apple already uses sapphire crystal in the Touch ID fingerprint scanner on its latest iPhone 5S and to protects the phone's camera.

As a result, sapphire glass could potentially replace Gorilla Glass currently used in most high-end smartphones.

Another image taken by the designers showed an embedded Apple logo that the designers claim is scratchproof, and made of Liquidmetal alloy.

Liquidmetal is a super-strong material that can be moulded into shape.

Another feature rumoured to feature in Apple’s iPhone 6 is a virtually indestructible screen made of sapphire.

To create enough of the man-made sapphire material, which make screens that are scratch-resistant and flexible, Apple struck a deal with GT Advanced Technologies in Mesa, Arizona.

The sapphire material will be manufactured at a plant powered by renewable energy, which has been built as part of the $578million (£350million) arrangement, The Guardian reported.It is claimed to be composed of thin man-made layers of sapphire, which enables the material to be flexible - giving it a change of withstanding knocks and falls that shatter other types of toughened glass.

A YouTube videomaker recently claimed to 
have acquired one of the screens - and subjected it to a barrage of 
abuse, from stabbing it with a knife and keys to bending and twisting 
it.

In the video, Marques Brownlee stands on the thin screen and bends it. When released, it goes back it its normal shape, raising hopes the new handset will have an almost indestructible screen
