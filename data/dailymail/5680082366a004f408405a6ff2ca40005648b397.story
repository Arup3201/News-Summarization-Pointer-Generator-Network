Ben Mee is more concerned with the impact Burnley’s win could have on their bid for Premier League survival than the blow it has dealt to his old club Manchester City.

Sale-born Mee captained City to victory in the FA Youth Cup in 2008, just four months before the Abu Dhabi takeover, but was one of a number of youngsters who realised their futures lay elsewhere. 

Having achieved his Premier League ambitions with Burnley, the 25-year-old left back is desperate to keep them there over the final nine games of the season after a surprise win over the champions.

Ben Mee says Burnley deserves a stroke of luck after this tackle was deemed OK by referee Andre Marriner

City right back Pablo Zabaleta clearly disagreed as the penalty should was waved away in his side's 1-0 loss

Mee, with Burnley keeper Tom Heaton, says the win was 'definitely a statement' for his side

‘We’re still in it as we always have been, but this is definitely a statement,’ said Mee.

‘Teams will be a bit shocked we’ve managed to get three points. City have got a lot to do now. 

'I had a couple of mates in the City end and I’m driving two of them home so I’ll enjoy that.’ 

Mee was relieved that referee Andre Marriner didn’t award a penalty for his challenge on Pablo Zabaleta late in the game.

He added: ‘You always worry the referee has seen it from an angle and will give it, but we deserve a bit of luck.’

Mee, playing against the club he led to the Youth FA Cup, found himself in Marriner's book
