Did you splash out on a pink coat last season? Consider it an investment piece because the candy cotton hued outerwear is here to stay.

In September 2013, M&S unveiled its £85 Collection Notch Lapel Oversized Duster Coat as part of its AW13 collection - and it fast became known as the 'style of the season', selling out nationwide.

Clearly the high street giant took note because it has brought the pink coat back for AW14 - and this time she's got a rainbow of friends in tow.

Remember me? In September 2013, M&S unveiled its £85 Collection Notch Lapel Oversized Duster Coat, pictured, which became the fashion staple of the season - and it's back for AW14 in a new style

Unveiled at the AW14 press day, M&S is introducing the coat in a staggering 20 shades from tomato red to citrus via classic black and navy. 

Speaking about the £125 jackets, which will land in store in July, M&S said: 'Our new cashmere blend coats are the perfect winter warmer - styled with chic, masculine tailoring and crafted with a unique "drawn" finish to provide a softer handle and drape.'

It's going to be a colourful winter: M&S has unveiled the range in 20 different colours including a more muted deep purple, left, and vibrant tangerine hue

Amanda Platell, who has long felt Marks had lost touch with stylish over-50s like herself, said of the range: 'I sometimes struggle 
to find coats that flatter. But from a timeless blue beauty with 
exquisite shiny buttons that appealed to my inner magpie, or one with a 
gorgeous grey, blue and pink check, I was tempted to do a runner with 
the lot.'

The ever-stylish Blake Lively proved that the pink coat is still hot after she landed in Cannes wearing a bright pink wrap number, while Jennifer Lawrence wore one for her Marie Claire cover shoot.

Toni Jones, editor of 30ishStylist.com, said: 'I missed out on the pink trend last season, and had major coat envy for most of winter. A bright coat is the perfect antidote to a grey day, and this rainbow collection is a great way for M&S to offer value to their most fashionable customers. It's incredible to be able to pick up a cashmere coat for under £150.

'I saw the full collection at the 
brand's recent autumn/winter press launch and up close these 'bloke 
coats' look and feel expensive and very chic. I'll be wearing mine 
(orange or pink, am still to decide) with skinny jeans or cigarette 
trousers and lots of lipstick.'

The future's bright: The coat collection was launched at this week's AM14 press day

It's a winner! M&S has just released images of its AW14 collection and the fashion world says 'mwah!'
