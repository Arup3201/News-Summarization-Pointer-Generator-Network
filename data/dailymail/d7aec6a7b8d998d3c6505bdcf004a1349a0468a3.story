Miranda Kerr ensured all eyes were on her earlier today when she turned up to the Louis Vuitton SS15 show as part of Paris Fashion Week. 

The model wore a simple black dress with a neckline that plunged to just above the navel for the event.

This isn't the first time that Miranda, 31, has bared half her chest for a crowd of photographers though.

As a Victoria's Secret model for six years, the mother-of-one was used to flaunting her figure in just a bikini or skimpy lingerie in front of crowds of people. 

And she was clearly good at it - Miranda replaced supermodel Gisele Bundchen as a Victoria's Secret Angel in 2007, keeping the job until 2013. 

But although the Australian no longer represents the American underwear firm or models their items for the catalogue, she is still seen baring her chest on regular occasions.
