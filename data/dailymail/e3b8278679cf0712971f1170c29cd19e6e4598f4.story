A grandmother killed herself after she was forced to leave a care home because of NHS cost-cutting.

An inquest found there were 'failures at every level' in the care of Sheila McInulty, 65, who died from a lethal overdose of prescription medication in February 2011 after managers ignored the advice of psychiatrists and removed her from the Mountview recovery unit in Northwood.

Ms McInulty, of Edgware, west London, was suffering with a mental health condition and had repeatedly attempted suicide, the Harrow Times reported.

Mountview Care Home, where Ms McInulty was given two days notice before being told to leave

A psychiatrist report recommended extended rehabilitation for the grandmother, with the aim that she would be able to return home.

But a funding decision by NHS Barnet and Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust meant that Mrs McInulty was released early.

North London coroner's court as told that the mother-of-three died after a string of failures by managers who passed responsibility for funding her care from NHS Barnet to Harrow council in order to save costs.

In July 2009, after a review of the minicab manager's health, she was transferred from a Barnet care home to Mountview residential care home, where her condition improved.

But in September 2010 a funding assessment decided that she would be transferred from the health trust to the Harrow Borough Council as it was mistakenly believed she had social care needs.

In November she was given just two days' notice to leave Mountview despite a review nine days earlier in which a psychiatrist said she presented 'an ongoing significant risk' of another overdose.

Clinical staff told the NHS commissioning manager the move was not in her interest, might cause harm and interrupt rehabilitation but the decision was not changed and Mrs McInulty was sent home to an empty house as her husband was working away from home.

North West London NHS Foundation Trust said that it had reviewed its processes

Although at first she coped well, her condition deteriorated and she committed suicide the following February.

Her daughter, Marie Coulter, 44, a legal secretary, said 'I'm angry, I'm upset, I'm heartbroken and I'm devastated,' the Evening Standard reported.

Coroner Andrew Walker, who delivered a narrative verdict, said: 'This represented a significant failure on the part of the individuals involved in the process and was the beginning of a chain of events that led to and directly caused Mrs McInulty's death.'

Central and North West London Foundation Trust - working on behalf of Harrow Council - was also criticised for not allowing the office manager to remain in the care home when it became responsible for her care, Barnet Today reported.

Mr Walker said: 'There were failures at every level in this process. The two care workers present (at her assessment) did not understand the process.'

The inquest was told that no supporting documents were gathered for the assessment and that a decision document that had been completed earlier had been lost and not rewritten.

Barnet clinical commissioning group — previously the Barnet primary care trust — has apologised to Mrs McInulty’s family, the Evening Standard reported.

A spokesman for the NHS agencies involved said that it had agreed an action plan to ensure that lessons were learned.

A spokesman for Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust said that it had reviewed its processes.
