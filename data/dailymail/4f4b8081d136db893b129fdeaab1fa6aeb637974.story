Ministers held crisis talks last night to avert a rebellion over David Cameron’s planning ‘free-for-all’ as it emerged it could lead to 40,000 unsightly extensions being thrown up each year.

Potential Tory and Lib Dem rebels were invited to a ‘drop-in session’ with planning minister Nick Boles as it emerged that at least 20 MPs are planning to oppose the government in a crucial vote today.

Zac Goldsmith, the environmentalist Conservative MP, today tore into the proposals as 'bad, clumsy politics' which will prove deeply unpopular without any evidence that it will solve any problems.

Anti plan: Zac Goldsmith, Conservative MP, will vote against the law which will double the length of extensions that people can build in their gardens without planning permission

Coalition backbenchers are furious at the controversial laws which will double the length of extensions that 
people can build in their gardens without planning permission.

They plan to vote for an amendment allowing local councils to opt out of the relaxed planning rules. Labour is expected to vote for the same amendment, meaning it would take less than 50 rebels to defeat the government.

Mr Goldsmith told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'It’s a very odd policy and I’m genuinely confused by trying to understand why the Government’s introduced it.

'It will guarantee disputes between neighbours, I don’t think anyone doubts that.

'It will be very unpopular and there’s no evidence, as far as I can see, that it’s going to solve any problems at all. It just seems like very bad, clumsy politics.'

A letter from Mr Boles to coalition MPs, seen by the Mail, reveals that his department believes the number of extra extensions going up each year will be double the 20,000 worst-case scenario foreseen by the Local Government Association.

Mr Boles’ letter said: ‘Our proposed reforms should make it quicker, easier and cheaper for up to 40,000 families a year wishing to build small-scale single-storey extensions and conservatories, while respecting the amenity of neighbours.’

His offer of talks came as research by local councils found the new rules would allow up to 3million extensions to be built on flood plains.

At present, such building work needs planning permission and applications are often turned down because of the risk of extra flooding. Councils are concerned that a raft of extensions in such areas could increase flood risk.

Set for fight: David Cameron's planning revolution 'will blight communities and set neighbour against neighbour' MPs warn

Opponents warn that Mr Cameron’s planning revolution - which will extend to 26 feet the maximum length of an extension without the need for permission from the council - will blight communities and set neighbour against neighbour.

Last month the House of Lords narrowly passed an amendment to the Growth and Infrastructure Bill, allowing local authorities to opt out of the new planning rules.

The amendment was tabled by Lord True, the leader of Richmond-upon-Thames Council in South West London.

Conservative councils up and down the country are lobbying their local MPs to urge them to vote for the opt-out amendment when it comes before the Commons today.

They include Cheshire West and Chester, Bexley, Tamworth, Richmond-upon-Thames, Croydon and - particularly embarrassing for the government - Lincolnshire Council, the local authority which covers Mr Boles’ Parliamentary seat.

And the Royal Town Planning Institute has warned MPs that the new rules could make it impossible to stop neighbours concreting over their entire gardens.

Last night Mr Goldsmith said: ‘Everyone wants to see a common sense reforms to planning policy so that uncontentious developments get a green light, and planning officers are able to focus on the cases that matter.

‘But this policy simply rips up all local input and guarantees hostilities between neighbours. It is madness to remove people’s right to object to developments that threaten their homes.

‘The Lords amendment is sensible and modest, and will allow local authorities to decide for themselves if the policy suits their communities. I will back it, and know many of my colleagues will do the same.’

He is expected to be supported by Tory MPs Anne Main, Stewart Jackson and Bob Blackman, and Lib Dem MP Paul Burstow.

Mr Blackman said: ‘Permitted development rights are in place to protect neighbours and communities from excessive development.

‘The current limits offer the right balance between preventing unnecessary bureaucracy whilst protecting against poor planning. The changes that have been proposed will damage this balance.

‘In my own constituency, Harrow Council approves only 69 per cent of applications. All of these applications are refused for good reason - applications, which under the proposed changes, could be free to go ahead unchecked.’

Mr Boles, in his letter, said the amendment was not needed because there was already a process which allows councils to opt out of the relaxation of planning rules.

However, the LGA said this ‘Article 4’ process is inadequate because it can leave councils open to litigation and can leave them liable to compensation if an extension is refused.

Claire Norman, of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: ‘We are concerned that, without further safeguards, greater freedom to convert buildings will only risk damaging the unique character and beauty of countryside that won’t replace itself.

‘Planning exists for a good reason. It balances what developers want to do for maximum profit, with what communities want, and what actually works long-term without ruining the environment.

‘If we use the planning process it means controls are applied and this won’t become a free-for-all.’
