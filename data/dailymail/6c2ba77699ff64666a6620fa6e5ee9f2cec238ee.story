Don't bottle it up: release 'pent up tension'

In the second part of our series  of mindfulness exercises – to help cope with chronic pain – DANNY PENMAN leads you through ‘Mindful Movement’ meditation.

It encourages you to ‘tune in’ to your body to release pent-up tension.

Being told to ‘smile’ can be annoying, but it might help your health.

Psychologists asked students to watch cartoons and rate how funny they were.

Some were asked to hold a pencil between their lips,  to mimic a scowl.

Others held a pencil between their teeth, simulating a smile. Those forced to smile found the cartoons funnier.

The process works in reverse too – frowning makes you unhappy.

And a tense neck, back or shoulders can trigger anxiety and stress.

Not only are emotions driven by such vicious cycles. Pain is too.

Pain creates tension in the body. The brain responds by turning up the ‘volume’ on its pain amplifiers, creating even more suffering.

Meditation can stop that cycle. Clinical trials show mindfulness can reduce pain by about 90 per cent and, with practice, your pain and suffering can evaporate.

The following Mindful Movement meditation helps the body ‘unlearn’ tension. Do it once a day.

Follow these instructions or download a free audio track from franticworld.com/mailonsunday. Also continue with last week’s ‘Body Scan’ exercise. It is taken from my book Mindfulness For Health.

- Stand with feet hip-width apart. Relax your shoulders and breathe naturally. Gently hold and support your right elbow in your left hand. Rotate your right hand at the wrist in a circle for 30 seconds.

Keep your breathing soft and even, and relax your arms. Then turn your wrist in the other direction for another 30 seconds.

Mindful moves: The correct exercise can see chronic pain and aches banished forever

Notice the effects of the movement on your right hand and arm. Does this side feel different from the left? More alive? Switch elbows and repeat the movement with the other hand, again thinking of its effects. Then relax your arms so they hang at your sides. Close your eyes. Gently shake your hands and arms. What sensations do you feel?

- Tune into your breathing. On the in-breath, extend both arms outwards to shoulder level, palms forwards. As you breathe out, gently draw both arms across your chest, cross your arms and give yourself a light hug

. Feel the back broadening and opening. Imagine the hug is saturated with kindness. On your next in-breath, open your arms until fully extended.

Feel a corresponding opening in the chest, with the shoulder blades drawing together. Repeat this movement for a minute. Then let the hands hang at your sides and give them a shake. Feel your breath and the sensation of being alive..
