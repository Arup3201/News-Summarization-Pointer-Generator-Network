Tragic: Schoolboy Harry Whitlam, of Wakefield, 
was struck by the tractor at around 9.20am on Friday morning at the 
Swithens Farm, Rothwell

A tractor driver has been arrested after an 11-year-old boy was killed at a farm in Leeds on Friday.

Schoolboy Harry Whitlam, of Wakefield, was struck by the tractor at around 9.20am on Friday morning at the Swithens Farm, Rothwell.

The youngster was rushed to Leeds General Infirmary by air ambulance - his injuries were so severe he was rushed into emergency surgery.

But despite doctors' efforts the 
youngest died on Friday evening - the driver, a 48-year-old man, was 
arrested on suspicion of drink driving and causing death by dangerous 
driving.

Detective 
Superintendent Scott Wood of West Yorkshire Police, said: 'Officers are 
still continuing to investigate this tragic incident with the Health and
Safety Executives and we are appealing for witnesses to come forward 
with information.

The driver has now been bailed pending continuing enquiries.

The farm is open to visitors, although a statement on its website said the collision occurred on the 'working part of the farm'.

According to the Yorkshire Post, Harry was working as a farm hand at the premises.

A spokesman for the farm said: 'There was a tragic accident on Friday and our thoughts are with Harry's family.

'We're still not sure of the full circumstances but the accident happened on the working part of the farm.

'The farm shop, cafe and petting farm are open to the general public and we are trying to run the business as normal.'

Accident: Harry was believed to be working as a farm hand at the premises when the accident happened

Location: The farm where the accident happened. The shop, cafe and farm are open to the general public
