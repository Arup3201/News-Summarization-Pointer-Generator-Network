A daughter of the man dubbed Britain’s most feckless father has criticised him for having 26 children by 15 different women and for spending his life living at the taxpayers' expense.

Peter Rolfe, from Newport on the
 Isle of Wight, has claimed more than £500,000 in state
 handouts over the course of his lifetime, and is now demanding his family is moved into
 a bigger council house.

But
 his 18-year-old daughter Roseanne - the only family member of his 
enormous family seeking work - today said: 'Dad should not have had as 
many kids... he was a Jack-the-Lad with an eye for the ladies, but that 
is no excuse.'

Last month Peter Rolfe sparked outrage when he appeared on ITV's This Morning to say he deserved the £500,000 in benefits, adding he felt he should have received even more money.

Feckless: Peter Rolfe (sitting, centre) has had 26 children by 15 different women, and has spent his life living at the taxpayers' expense. Now one of his daughters, Roseanne (pictured in black), has slammed his way of life

Benefits: Former chef Peter Rolfe, from Newport on the Isle of Wight, has already claimed more than £500,000 in state handouts over the course of his lifetime

Roseanne Rolfe, who is training to become a painter and decorator, said her father should have practiced safe sex to avoid having so many children.

'I would like a couple of children, but I won’t expect the taxpayer to pick up the bill,' she added.

Ms
 Rolfe still lives in Newport with her father; brother Peter Junior, 19;
 sisters Marieanne, 15, Carrieanne, 14, and Leeanne, 17; and Leeanne’s 
one-year-old twins.

'I could have left home at 16 and got my own council house, but I want to better myself,' she told Closer magazine.

'Dad has looked after me well and we are close, but I don’t agree with how he has lived his life,' she added.

Demands: Peter Rolfe is insisting his family be moved into a bigger council house after describing his three-bedroom property in Newport, Isle of Wight (pictured) as 'a prison'

Mr Rolfe, a former chef, currently receives up to £800 a week in welfare payments.

He caused outrage when he and his family of 14 boys and 12 girls appeared on a shocking new Channel Five TV series, Benefits Britain: Life On The Dole, which featured parents who view children as a ticket to an easy life.

Now Mr Rolfe - whose children range in age from nine to 40 - wants a larger home after complaining that his current three-bed house is a 'prison'.

The unemployed father has even blamed the children’s mothers for his predicament, saying: 'I believe some got pregnant on purpose.'

In her father’s defence, Ms Rolfe said her father became the family’s primary carer when she was four, after he split from her mother.

Mr Rolfe gave up his chef’s job and began receiving £30,000 a year in state benefits.

Challenge: Peter Rolfe said people who criticise him should imagine what it's like being a father of 26

Upwardly mobile on benefits: Peter Rolfe has successfully applied for disability allowance which means his family gets £800 a week (and he gets a mobility scooter)

Ms Rolfe, who no longer has any contact with her mother, said: 'We had to be careful with money, but we never went without'

'There was always food on the table and Dad would treat us to days out at the beach.'

'As we got older, he developed arthritis, heart problems and type 2 diabetes, so he was unable to work - even if he had wanted to.'

Ms Rolfe left school at 15 with no qualifications, but enrolled at college to study English, maths and information technology.

'I did not want to live in a cramped house with no money. I wanted a decent job... Dad was proud of me. He wanted me to have a better life than him,' she said.

Ms Rolfe, whose boyfriend Ross, 21, works as a nurse, then signed up for a two-year painter and decorator course.

'I can’t wait to start earning my own money,' she said.

'Ross and I plan to save to rent our own place. I will prove out family aren’t scroungers,' she added.
