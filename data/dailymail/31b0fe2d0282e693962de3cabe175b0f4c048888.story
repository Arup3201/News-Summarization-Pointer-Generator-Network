The father of former England captain David Beckham has launched a lawsuit over the phone-hacking scandal.

Ted Beckham has joined a string of public figures suing News Group Newspapers (NGN) and private investigator Glen Mulcaire over allegations of phone hacking at the News of the World.

He has issued a claim form in his full name of David Edward Alan Beckham at the Royal Courts of Justice in London.

His legal battle relates to News International subsidiary NGN, publishers of the defunct News of the World, which closed last year, but the exact details of his claim weren't made available.

His son David, 36, played for Manchester United and Real Madrid before moving to LA Galaxy in the US. He has also returend to Europe for two loan spells with AC Milan.

Other notable individuals suing are Cherie Blair, Jamie Theakston, cleared murder suspect Colin Stagg and Jeff Brazier.

News International has already settled dozens of claims, including legal proceedings brought by actor Jude Law and singer Charlotte Church.

Also suing: Cherie Blair and Jamie Theakston are among the latest group of high-profile figures taking action against Rupert Murdoch's company

Many cases are yet to be heard and it is expected that several hundred more noted individuals may bring claims against the newspaper publishers.

Last month, Miss Church, 26, accepted £600,000 damages from NGN after hearing in the High Court how phone-hacking directly led to 33 articles appearing about her and her family in the News of the World.

A number of other celebrities, including Steve Coogan, Paul Gascoigne and Alastair Campbell have also settled cases, with the bill for Rupert Murdoch's company now running into millions.

Mr Coogan received £40,000 after the High Court heard Mr Mulcaire posed as him to get confidential information from Vodafone between 2003 and 2006.

Big pay-outs: Singer Charlotte Church won £600,000 in damages from NGN, while ex-England footballer Paul Gascoigne settled for £68,000 earlier this year

Former Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell received undisclosed ‘substantial damages’, while Liberal Democrat MP Simon Hughes won £45,000.

Mr Gascoigne was handed £68,000 because of the ‘mental harm and distress’ caused by the paper's subterfuge.

The former England footballer was so convinced that the information published about him had come from his closest friends that he suffered a breakdown.

A total of 22 people, including former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks, have been arrested in Operation Weeting, the Scotland Yard investigation into phone hacking.
