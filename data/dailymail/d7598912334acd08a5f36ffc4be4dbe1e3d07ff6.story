Former England goalkeeper David James scored a fashion own goal on Wednesday night.

The 44-year-old, one of the 'Spice Boys' at Liverpool, has always had a penchant for sharp suits, colourful clothes and wacky hairstyles.

James also modeled for Italian designer Giorgio Armani and organised the infamous cream suits for Liverpool's 1996 FA Cup final squad.

But James had TV viewers wondering if he got dressed in the dark after appearing on BT Sport's Football Tonight wearing a garish green and brown shirt emblazoned with trees.

Others questioned whether the shirt was left over following the recent auction of his personal belongings after being declared bankrupt in May. 

James has built up crippling debts after breaking up with his wife Tanya in 2005 and is said to have blown his £20million fortune which came from his football wages, endorsements and modelling contracts for companies such as Armani.
