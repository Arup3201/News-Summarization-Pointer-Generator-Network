The cost of paying gold-plated pensions to Britain’s public sector workers will balloon by nearly 60 per cent over the next five years, official forecasts revealed this week.

Experts warned it makes a mockery of the Government’s claim to have tackled the problem of the crippling cost of paying such generous pensions to the State workforce.

Under the deal, hammered out by ministers, public sector workers will have to work longer and pay more for their pensions and many will get less when they retire.

Contentious: Last year ministers managed to force public sector workers to work longer and get less money for retirement, leading to a strike, but they remain some of the most generous pensions in the country

But they remain among the most generous retirement payouts in the country, according to the forecast from the Government’s independent financial watchdog published this week.

Between April 2012 and April 2013, the cost of paying the pensions of retired NHS workers, teachers, civil servants and the Armed Forces is £8.9billion.

But this figure is set to rocket to £14.1billion five years later in the year 2017/18, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. This is an increase of 58 per cent.

To make matters worse, this is not even the full cost to the taxpayer of paying the pensions of all retired public sector workers.

It does not include the cost of paying the pensions of many other types of State workers, such as the police, firefighters, MPs and local government workers.

And the OBR’s analysis, published in the Budget’s so-called Red Book, does not even include the full cost to the taxpayer of paying the pensions it does include.

This is because it deducts the amount contributed by the employer into their workers’ pensions - but the ‘employer’ is the State, paid for by taxpayers.

Lord Oakeshott, a leading LibDem lord and a former pensions spokesman, said: ‘Public sector pensions costs are due to rise by an eye-watering amount every year.

‘Meanwhile private sector pensions are being squeezed and the Bank of England’s quantitative easing programme is hammering annuity rates for private savers.

‘Our coalition Government has only half defused the ticking public sector pensions time bomb Labour left us.’

Time bomb: Lord Matthew Oakeshott said that Labour had left behind 'eye-watering' public sector rises while private sector pensions are being squeezed

It comes as gold-plated pensions in the private sector are being shut down at the fastest rate on record, according to the National Association of Pension Funds.In 2005, 43 per cent of defined benefit schemes allowed new recruits to a company to join. Today the figure has collapsed to just 13 per cent following the biggest-ever drop last year.A defined benefit pension promises to pay a worker a certain pension when they retire, typically linked to their final salary or their average salary over their career.Matthew Sinclair, chief executive of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, the campaign group, said: ‘The growing burden of public sector pensions shows little sign of slowing despite government promises of reform.‘Unions have vociferously resisted even moderate reforms and it is taxpayers who are paying the price for that.‘We’re all living longer, and this bill isn’t getting any smaller.’ 

It comes as unions are plotting strike action over changes to their pensions as well as other grievances.Members of the militant Public and Commercial Services union walking out on Budget Day and teachers will walk out later this year.The Treasury says the Government’s reforms will save billions of pounds over the next few decades and have put public service pensions onto a sustainable footing.
