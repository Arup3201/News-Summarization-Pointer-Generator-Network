Wayne Rooney edged closer to Sir Bobby Charlton’s England goal-scoring record after his late free-kick against Estonia secured three vital points for England in their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign.

England’s captain had a mixed game in Tallinn and missed a plethora of chances to accelerate towards the goals record.

Rooney scored his ninth goal in European qualifiers, surpassing Kevin Keegan with only Michael Owen ahead on 11 goals.

Roy Hodgson’s side struggled in front of goal against Estonia but will be pleased to leave with three wins from three fixtures in Group E.

Rooney was relieved England managed to finally score after a frustrating evening in Tallinn:

‘For the goal, it was close in so I was focussing on getting it over the wall. I've shown over the years I'm always capable of scoring goals.’

Wayne Rooney will have wanted to score more than just two goals against San Marino and Estonia. With the opportunities he had, he could have overtaken Sir Bobby Charlton’s all-time England record.

SAN MARINO

6 mins - A free-kick from inside the area is punched away

18 mins - Shoots from 25 yards but his effort is comfortably gathered

51 mins - Has a free header but fails to take advantage

61 mins - Beats the offside trap but his chip is easily saved

81 mins - Another header and another save by the keeper

86 mins - Hammers a shot wide from the right of the area

ESTONIA

16 mins - Volleys Jack Wilshere’s lofted pass over the bar

17 mins - Misses the ball from Leighton Baines’ cross

39 mins - A header from the centre of the area goes over

89 mins - Hooks a difficult chance over on the volley

90 mins - Through one on one but hits it straight at the keeper 

England’s captain was evidently pleased how the squad persevered against the 10-men of Estonia:

‘We knew that's how the game would go. We know they are tough games with men behind the ball and it's tough to break them down. It's a good win.

‘Their keeper made a good save at the end from me. We are playing well, the pleasing thing is that we have a young team and we hung in there.’

Rooney is also expected to win his 100th cap for England next month at home to Slovenia in the next Euro 2016 qualifier, putting him in prime position to break Peter Shilton’s all-time record of 125 appearances for the national side.

Rooney, leading out his side, is only six goals behind England's leading all-time scorer Sir Bobby Charlton
