Mikel Arteta has taken his first steps towards management by offering his services to Arsenal's academy.

The Gunners skipper took the club's Under-13s training session at their Hale End academy on Wednesday night.

The Spaniard is understood to be taking his coaching badges, with sessions such as last night a key component of Arteta's training.

The midfielder's contract expires at the end of the season and is yet to pen new terms.

He had been offered a new 12 month contract, but the club are yet to confirm whether Arteta has accepted the extension.

However, the Gunners are confident he'll agree to the deal and stay for at least another season.
