A beer delivery man doing his normal weekend rounds became a hero after he body slammed a masked 14-year-old boy who was trying to rob the store.

Brock Nulph from Pope Beer Distributing, was  at D&T Convenience in Enid, Oklahoma, last week when the suspect threatened the clerk over the counter.

With little time to react, he ran out of the cooler and grabbed the youngster, dragged him to the middle of the store and then threw him onto the floor.

Attempted robbery: A masked 14-year-old boy walks into a store in Enid, Oklahoma, pointing at the store clerk 

Reaction: However, after hearing cries for help, beer delivery man Brock Nulph walks out of the cooler and grabs hold of the suspect 

He then held him down as the employee ran outside to fetch two police officers who arrested him.

'I had a second to make my decision. That's what I did,' he told Fox and Friends Weekend.

'He had a stick wrapped up, looking like a gun that he had under his sleeve. But I didn't know that at the time. I also didn't know he was 14. 

'I guess he kept pointing it at the register and pointing behind. The lady had a tazer in her hand and was trying to scare him off but he kept coming at her. 

Mr Nulph added that when police came in they were glad that no one was hurt and made sure they had the right suspect. 

Despite the heroics, Mr Nulph insisted that he would be back doing the rounds again on Monday morning.
