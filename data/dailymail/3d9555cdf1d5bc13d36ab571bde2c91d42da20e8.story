A passenger train collided with a double-decker city bus in Ottawa today, killing six people and critically injuring 11 others.

Witnesses said the bus went through a closed crossing barrier, and passengers said they screamed 'Stop, stop!' at the driver just before impact.

The front end of the double-decker bus was completely ripped off by the impact with the Via Rail train.

Officials said 30 people were injured, 10 critically, at the peak of Ottawa's morning rush hour.

The cause of the crash was not yet 
clear, said John Manconi with bus operator OC Transpo. Transit union 
president Craig Watson said the driver was killed.

Passenger Gregory Mech said the bus was approaching a train crossing where there is about a 90-degree bend. Mech said he didn't think the driver noticed that signals were flashing and that the barrier was down.

It was Canada's worst train accident 
since an oil train derailed and exploded in a Quebec town in July, 
killing dozens of people.

A number of bus passengers were injured, Ottawa Fire spokesman Mark Messier told CP24 television. Via 
Rail posted a message on Twitter saying there were no reports of major 
injuries to passengers or crew on the train.
