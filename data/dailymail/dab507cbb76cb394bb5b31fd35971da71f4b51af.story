Emotional Reunion: Jim Routon hugs Hezekiah Darbon at Briarwood Elementary school after a tornado destroyed the school in south Oklahoma City, Monday, May 20, 2013

Stood on muddy grass outside a suburban church, many parents just stare into the distance, some holding the hands 
of young children who are missing their siblings.

They are here in hope, desperately waiting to be reunited with their children following the deadly tornado which ripped through Oklahoma.

As the parents and guardians of missing children wait at St. Andrews United Methodist Church, they listen intently. Those who are fortunate hear someone with a bullhorn calling out the names of surviving children who are being dropped off.

For those families, the ordeal ended in bear hugs and tears of joy as loved ones are reunited.

However, other families are left to wait in the darkness, still hoping for good news while fearing the worst.

At least 20 children are among those feared dead.

Initial estimates put the death toll at 91 reported in Moore, the Oklahoma City suburb ravaged by Monday's tornado that packed winds of up to 200 mph. 

This morning authorities said that number came from the chaotic aftermath of the storm and there are only 24 confirmed casualties. They still, however, expect that number to rise.

The twister reduced one elementary school to a heaping mound of rubble and heavily damaged another while also flattening block after block of homes.

At St. Andrews, Tonya Sharp and Deanna Wallace sat at a 
table in the church's gymnasium waiting for their teenage daughters.

As 
Sharp and Wallace spoke, a line of students walked in.

Wallace spotted her 16-year-old 
daughter, who came quickly her way and jumped into her mother's arms, 
pushing her several steps backward in the process.

But Sharp didn't see 
her daughter, a 17-year-old who has epilepsy. She worried her daughter 
hadn't taken her medicine.

Horrific: Teachers carry children away from Briarwood Elementary school after the tornado destroyed the school. Many parents have been separated from their children and are waiting at a city church to be reunited with them

Concerned: The tornado has resulted in many children becoming separated from their parents and guardians

Heartbreaking: A woman carries a child through a field near the collapsed Plaza Towers Elementary School. Many parents still have no idea where there children are 

'I
don't know where she's at,' Sharp said. Later, she went to speak to 
officials who helped her register so she could be notified as soon as 
her daughter was found.

Shelli
Smith had to walk miles to find her children. She was reunited with her
14-year-old daughter, Tiauna, around 5 p.m. Monday, but hadn't yet seen
her 16-year-old son, TJ, since he left for school that morning.

TJ's phone had died, but he borrowed a classmate's phone to tell his mother where he was. However, Smith couldn't get to him due to the roadblocks. So she parked her car and started walking.

It took her three hours, but a little
after sunset, she found him.

Devastating: The giant two-mile wide tornado has left up to 91 people dead

Lucky: This boy was pulled from beneath a collapsed wall at the Plaza Towers Elementary School. Some parents have described walking for hours in order to be reunited with their children

Devastation: Two girls stand in rubble after the two mile-wide tornado struck

She grabbed her son and squeezed him in a 
tight hug that lasted for several seconds before letting go. TJ hugged 
his sister, and then hugged his mom again.

The family had a long walk back to their car and then home, but she said she didn't mind.

'I
was trying to get him and they wouldn't let me,' she said, adding 
later: 'I was like, 'You know what? 'I'm going to get my son.'

Renee Lee summed up the struggle for many parents with multiple children - find the ones who they hadn't yet seen, while calming the younger ones they had with them.

Another person waiting for news was Mark Troxell. The youngest of nine is waiting at the OU Trauma Center to hear news about his older brother Mark, who he fears was caught in the center of the storm.

'What I heard is he was opening the front door and then his house blew away,'  Troxwell told KFOR.COM.

'Wait, that’s all we can do is wait,' Mark Troxell said.

Horrific: As many as 20 children are feared dead following the devastating tornado. This man hugs his neighbor outside her home

Valor: Rescue workers help free injured survivors of the storm in Moore after a tornado tore through the area

Exhausted: Children wait for their parents to arrive at Briarwood Elementary School  

Lee is the mother of two daughters 
Sydney Walker, 16, and Hannah Lee, 8. When the storm came, she tried to 
pick Sydney up from school.

Sydney
told her on the phone that they wouldn't let her come in. While Lee and
her younger daughter waited in their home, which wasn't hit, Sydney was
safe in the room at a local high school.

Lee said she believed Sydney wasn't hurt and seemed resigned to the severe weather outbreaks.

'There's been so many of them, it doesn't even faze me,' she said. 'You just do what you gotta do. It's part of living here.'

One family have made a desperate appeal for information.

Janae Hornsby, 9, was a student at the destroyed Plaza Towers Elementary School.

Her father told KOCO.COM that she is a vivacious loveable little girl who 'always has a smile on her face'.

The devastating wait for parents of Plaza students was made worse as officials seemed to signal an end to their hopes of retrieving more people alive from the flattened school.

'They’re looking for life, but they have not had any hits recently, so they’re in recovery mode now,' Gov. Mary Fallin said late Monday.
