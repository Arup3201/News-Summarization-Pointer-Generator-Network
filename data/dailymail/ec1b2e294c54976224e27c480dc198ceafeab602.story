The sister of Josh Powell has published a book where she writes about her suspicions over his  involvement in his wife Susan's disappearance.

Susan Cox Powell, a married mother of two young sons, vanished from her suburban Salt Lake City home in the middle of the night in December 2009.

Jennifer Graves' book, A Light in Dark Places: A Story of Heartbreak, Survival and Redemption, was released on Monday.

In the memoir, co-written by Emily Clawson, Mrs Graves says she grew suspicious about her brother Josh while also telling about her father Steven Powell's addiction to porn when she was growing up.

Josh Powell claimed his wife went missing in 2009 shortly after he left to go camping in the desert with their sons, who were two and four years old at the time, despite a snowstorm that blanketed the area.

The police investigation led to searches of abandoned mines in Utah and neighboring Nevada, and authorities kept their attention on Josh Powell even as he moved from West Valley City, Utah, to Puyallup, Washington.

Tragically he attacked his sons Charlie and Braden with a hatchet last year after saying he 'had a big surprise' for them before setting his home on fire, causing an explosion which killed them all.

In January 2010, so deep were Mrs Graves' suspicions about her brother's involvement in Susan's disappearance that she went to her father's house wearing a hidden police microphone.

She confronted Josh at the family home in Puyallup, Washington in front of her father and other siblings Michael and Alina.

According to her new book, her father chased her from the house, telling his daughter she was no longer welcome.

However following the family rift, Mrs Graves said that she was able to hold her head high, believing that she had done the right thing.

The
book begins with the murder of her young nephews at their father's 
hands in 2012 and retraces what happened from the night that Susan was 
reported missing.

Mrs Graves also covers her childhood in the memoir describing her parents' divorce and her father's obsession with pornography. She said that writing the book was a cathartic experience.

Mrs Graves told deseretnews.com: 'Definitely it was very helpful for me. 
But it wasn't the only reason (I wrote it).

'I really felt like I needed 
to do this to help other people to recognize abuse in either their own 
relationships or relationships around them, because it's not always 
completely apparent.'

Mrs Graves also writes about her fraught relationship with her mother Terri Powell as she continued to defend Josh.

Mrs Graves, cut her mother off after she wrote to the court's in support of Josh retaining custody of his two sons.

Mrs Graves' father Steve Powell is behind bars on voyeurism charges after being convicted of taking photos of young neighbor girls without their knowledge, a crime that emerged after police seized computer hard-drives from his home while investigating Susan Powell's disappearance.

He has denied involvement, but Steve Powell became a public figure in the case after going on national television and saying he and his daughter-in-law had been falling in love.

A Light in Dark Places is available at Amazon.com.
