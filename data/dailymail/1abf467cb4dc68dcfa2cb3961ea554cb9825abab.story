Researchers and archivists from University of California are asking for help in transcribing field notes and identifying insect specimens dating back over 100 years.

Among the collection is a Tierra del Fuego beetle discovered in 1833 by Charles Darwin.

Volunteers can look at the specimens and submit their transcriptions online using the Berkeley university's Calbug system.

Citizen scientists will be able transcribe labels similar to the one pictured, which shows a ground beetle from Tierra del Fuego, Chile that was collected in 1833 by Charles Darwin. Volunteers can look through the other collections from UC Berkeley's Essig Museum of Entomology and submit transcriptions using its Calbug system

Calbug is an online project that hopes to  
digitise arthropod specimen records from California.

The team behind the project plan to use 
these records to examine impacts of climate change and habitat modification.

The project is a 
collaboration between eight entomological collections in California.

As part of Calbug, citizen scientists can submit their analsyis of specimens on the Zooniverse.

Zooniverse is a web portal owned and operated by the Citizen Science Alliance.

It was developed  from the original Galaxy Zoo project and now runs more than a dozen projects that let volunteers take part in scientific research. 

As of 30 January 2013, the Zooniverse community consisted of more than 785,000 volunteers, gaining on average 500-1,000 daily registrations.

The volunteers are often collectively referred to as 'Zooites'.

Calbug teamed up with two other natural history collections – one focused on plants and the other on birds – to create Notes from Nature, a citizen science project that draws on the public to tame the voluminous records stored in drawers, jars and bookshelves in natural history museums throughout the world.

Calbug co-investigator Kipling Will, associate professor of Environmental, Science Policy and Management at the university said: 'What really turns people on is knowing that they are contributing to science in a meaningful way.'

These citizen science projects speak to the importance of public engagement in science.'

'Without the help of citizen scientists, processing the sheer volume of records held in natural history collections — estimated to be well over 2 billion worldwide — would take generations,' added Rosemary Gillespie, director of the Essig Museum and principal investigator of the Calbug project.

Notes from Nature is among the many projects in the Zooniverse - a web-portal where citizens can help answer a diverse range of scientific questions, such as how stars form, what whale calls mean, and what life was like in the ancient Egyptian town of Oxyrhynchus.

Arfon Smith, director of citizen science at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago and the technical lead for Zooniverse said: 'Our projects help answer research questions that can only be solved by a significant amount of human attention — they require people, not computers.'

'People have responded in a way that is truly great. There is an appetite for contributing to something real.'

UC Berkeley graduate student Joan Ball holds a display of specimens at the Essig Museum of Entomology. There are around 6.5 million specimens in California's eight major entomological collections that need digitising as part of the Zooniverse project

In addition to insects, Notes from Nature participants can help digitize plant records from the Southeast Regional Network of Expertise and Collections (SERNEC).

The SERNEC collections include thousands of specimen images, labels and ledgers from hundreds of herbaria in the Southeast United States.

The Calbug project originally began with support from a 2010 National Science Foundation grant to digitize the first million — out of 6.5 million total — specimens from California’s eight major entomological collections.

As well as UC Berkeley, Calbug includes insect collections from the California Academy of Sciences, UC Davis, UC Riverside, UC Santa Cruz, the California State Collection of Arthropods, Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History, San Diego Natural History Museum and the Los Angeles County Museum.

Among the collection of specimens that need cataloguing at UC Berkeley's Essig Museum of Entomology is a ground beetle found by naturalist Charles Darwin, pictured, in 1833

'California has a rich history of insect collecting dating back to around 1900 and earlier,' said Gillespie, a professor in UC Berkeley’s Department of Environmental Science, Policy and Management.

'Through Calbug, our goal is to make at least some of those records, which are normally inaccessible to the public, available to people around the world.

And by converting those labels into electronic records, it will be possible for us to track any changes in range for different species, and that provides insight into how animals react to changes in the environment.'

Questions have been asked about the level of accuracy of the transcriptions entered by the citizen scientists.

Researchers from the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History are working with Zooniverse to evaluate the cost, accuracy and speed of volunteer transcriptions from the Notes from Nature site.

The site launched in beta in late April.

The first 20,000 images, which included an insects like bombardier beetles and skipper butterflies.

About a third of these records have already been transcribed by more than 2,000 users.
