Apple in China has posted instructions on how to tell an official power adapter from a fake one, after a number of iPhone owners claim to have been electrocuted by their handsets.

The page shows images of chargers for each Apple device, including the iPhone 5 and the iPad 2, with the safety notices underneath.

The recent electrocutions took place in the Chinese cities of Beijing and Xinjian, putting one man into a coma and killing another woman.

Apple in China has posted instructions on how to tell an official power adapter from a fake one, after a number of iPhone owners claim to have been electrocuted by their handsets

The site reads: 'This overview will help you identify genuine Apple USB power adapter.

'When you need to charge the iPhone or iPad, we recommend that you use the standard USB power adapter and USB cable.'

All iPhone and iPads are sold with official Apple chargers, although fake replacements can be bought online.

Earlier this week a Chinese man reportedly fell into a coma after suffering an electric shock as he plugged in his iPhone 4 in to charge.

'He shouted 'electric shock' and then fell to the floor,' Wu's sister told Xinhua news agency, adding that she felt a slight shock herself when she tried to unplug the faulty charger, which she said was not official Apple hardware.

Reports claim a man in Beijing was put into a coma after a faulty phone charger gave him an electric shock when he plugged in his iPhone 4. Another woman in Xinjian died when she answered her iPhone 5 while it was charging. Both have been linked with faulty, counterfeit chargers

An Apple spokesman said: 'It was with great sadness we learned through press reports that a Beijing customer was injured while using a "knock off" or counterfeit charger and we are looking into this further.

'Our customers' safety is very important to us and we have carefully designed all Apple products to meet government safety standards. We recommend our customers only purchase Apple products from Apple or authorized Apple resellers.'

The incident in Beijing occurred a week after a Chinese air stewardess was killed by an electric shock when she answered a call on her iPhone 5 while it was recharging.

News of the death of Ma Ailun, 23, was posted on the internet by her sister, prompting criticism of Apple among the countryâ€™s millions of iPhone users.

Further health warnings were issued in Australia after after a Sydney woman was taken to hospital when she allegedly received an electric shock from her phone.

However, this incident did not explicitly state that the phone was an iPhone and further investigation by New South Wales Ambulance found the incident was related to a 'mental health issue.'
