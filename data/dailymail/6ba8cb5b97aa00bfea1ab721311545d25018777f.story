Hero: Jennifer MacMillan took quick action to save the lives of her two children and young sisters

The daughter of late children's TV star Terry Nutkins has been hailed a hero after pulling four members of her family from Loch Ness after a car accident on New Year's Eve.

Jennifer MacMillan was driving her two children and two teenage sisters through the Scottish Highlands when their car skidded off the road and into the freezing waters of the loch.

The quick-thinking mother managed to pull all four youngsters from the car and get them to safety - but says it has been hard to get over the traumatic accident.

The 34-year-old is the eldest 
daughter of Mr Nutkins, the naturalist who was a popular television 
presenter until his death from cancer four months ago.

Ms MacMillan told the Daily Record
how her Volkswagen Transporter skidded off the road, fell 100ft down an
embankment and ended up in Loch Ness as she was driving with her family
on Monday morning.

She
was quick to ensure the safety of her own children and her sisters, 
15-year-old Abigail and Sarah, 13, before calling emergency services to 
help.

The three Nutkins sisters are among the eight children the TV presenter had with his wife Jackie, whom he married in 1979, over more than two decades.

A witness said that 
the five were lucky to survive the fall into the icy lake, telling the 
Record: 'The crash could have killed them all but for the trees slowing 
them down.'

He added: 'Another few feet and they could have drowned. I can hardly believe they've come out of it alive.'

The family was taken to hospital in Inverness and was released with only minor injuries.

'The occupants of the car were 
very, very lucky to escape with minor injuries from such a serious 
accident,' a police spokesman said.

Ms MacMillan revealed that the 
accident had seriously shaken her, saying: 'I'm still trying to get over
the accident, trying to put it behind me.

'I don't want to talk about it. I don't want to even think about it.'

The mother of two, who split up with her husband last year, said she was looking forward to putting 2012 behind her and enjoying the new year.

Mr Nutkins died of leukaemia in September aged 66, in the village of Glenelg where he lived with his family, including Ms MacMillan.

He was well known for presenting BBC nature programmes aimed at children such as Animal Magic and The Really Wild Show.
