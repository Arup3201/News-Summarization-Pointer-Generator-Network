Superstar NRL fullback Greg Inglis has sunk the hearts of Sydney Roosters supporters by leading the Hollywood-owned South Sydney Rabbitohs into their first rugby league grand final in 43 years.

The Rabbitohs' number one  tore the Roosters apart in the 32-22 win, scoring twice to end NRL veteran and Roosters' captain Anthony Minichiello's 14-year career in the game.

The highly anticipated semi-final at Homebush, Sydney, was watched by South Sydney owner Russell Crowe who walked onto the ground after the match to embrace his players in an emotionally-charged Sydney derby.

The match, played in front of 52,592 fans, will see Souths play in their first grand final since 1971 and sets the tone for a mouth-watering weekend of sport across the nation as the Sydney Swans and Hawthorn Hawks battle it out in Saturday's AFL grand final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

It is expected a crowd of 100,000 fans will front the MCG to watch the most celebrated day of sport for the code. 

Supporters cheer on the red and green of South Sydney who will play in their first grand final in more than 40 years

Roosters captain Anthony Minichiello looked destined for a fairy tale finish  when he scored early to take the Roosters to a 12 point lead. 

Scoring off a James Maloney kick, Minichiello and the Roosters looked ominous early but couldn't deliver the knock-out punch as the Rabbitohs stormed back into the match scoring 30 unanswered points to steer themselves into next week's NRL grand final.

It also ends Sonny Bill Williams' return to the NRL with the 2013 premiership winner heading to New Zealand rugby next season to play for his old club, The Chiefs. 

South Sydney will either play either meet the Canterbury Bulldogs or Penrith Panthers in  next Sunday's decider at ANZ stadium.

Russell Crowe's men took the game away from the Roosters in front of a healthy crowd of 52,592 people.

The Friday night blockbuster was the perfect prelude to a weekend of  footy finals across Australia with tomorrow's AFL grand final set to draw a crowd double that size. 

The dramatic night of sport unfolded before a ball was even kicked when heavily guarded police officers patrolled train stations and outside the ground.

The extra security was in response to the  heightened terror alert in the wake of recent events across the country.

Both sides went in to the half-time break equal before the Rabbitoh's shot clear to win by 10 points. 

Rabbitohs forward Sam Burgess was named man-of-the-match in what will be his penultimate match for the club before heading back to play in the English Super League.

Like Lance Buddy Franklin for the Sydney Swans, Burgess has been one of the Rabbitohs' highest paid recruits since coming to the club in 2013.

Before the season started he announced a return to the English Super League but committed himself to finishing on a high at South Sydney by putting himself on a self-imposed media ban.

He has since broken that ban and after the match spoke with Channel Nine reporter Andrew Johns about the most important achievement on his mind this year - winning a grand final.

'It was a good performance, we went down 12 early but we stuck in there and didn't panic.'

'We have worked for this all year. It's been in my mind and the only thing I have thought about, it's good to finally get there but we've not achieved anything just yet.'

'I have made some great friends (at South Sydney) i'm just going to enjoy the next nine, 10 days, and then maybe the next couple of days after that.

'It's been a cracking journey.'

South Sydney coach Michael Macguire spoke candidly about this team's incredibly tough performance. 

'I'm just really proud of my players,' he said. 'The smiles on their face mate, it's unreal.' 

Although recent history would have fans believe otherwise, South Sydney are the most successful rugby league side in the game having won 20 premierships.

It has been 43 years since they last appeared in and won a grand final which was way back in 1971 against the St George Dragons.
