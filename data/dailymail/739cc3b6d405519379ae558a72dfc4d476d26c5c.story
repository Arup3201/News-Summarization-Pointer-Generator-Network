Scotland Yard was urged to investigate the former head of the Serious Fraud Office yesterday after it emerged that he approved ‘irregular’ taxpayer-funded payoffs to staff worth £1million.

Shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry asked the Metropolitan Police chief to examine whether the behaviour of Richard Alderman constituted misconduct in public office.

She accused the former boss of the corruption watchdog of ‘flying in the face of legal advice’ by sanctioning bumper severance payments without approval.

She said: ‘A financial irregularity on this scale is an affront to the standing of the SFO, which is supposed to be the nation’s flagship fraud and corruption watchdog.’

The development came after a report by the Public Accounts Committee found Mr Alderman did not get approval from the Cabinet Office or Treasury before agreeing payouts to three senior civil servants taking voluntary redundancy.

One of them, former chief executive Phillippa Williamson, was also allowed to work from her Lancashire home near the Lake District and rack up travel and hotel bills worth £98,946 when visiting the London office for three days a week.

MPs on the committee said Mr Alderman, 60, who retired as director of the SFO last April days after Mrs Williamson left, had ‘failed to follow due process’ or ‘to comply with the rules that should underpin the use of public money’. The report described the SFO as a case study in ‘how not to run a public body’.

In a letter to Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the Met Commissioner, Miss Thornberry wrote: ‘I fear that Richard Alderman’s conduct with regard to severance packages and ex-gratia payments to senior staff may amount to an offence of misconduct in public office. I would be very grateful  for any assistance that you can offer in investigating this deeply troubling matter.’

The Labour MP said the report made clear that ‘Alderman failed to obtain approval for exit payments totalling over £1million and did so flying in the face of legal advice’.

Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘It’s deeply worrying that the body charged with rooting out financial malpractice has been found so wanting in its own affairs. It raises questions over how the public can trust a body in such a sensitive position.’

Mrs Williamson was given a payout of more than £464,000, including an ‘irregular’ £407,000 pension top-up that did not go through the proper approval process. Mr Alderman’s failure to obtain the appropriate permission led to the National Audit Office refusing to sign off Serious Fraud Office accounts.

Mr Alderman also decided on a £15,000 special payment to Miss Williamson and former chief operating officer Christian Bailes to avoid grievance actions, despite legal advice that there were no such claims to be made. Mr Bailes’s severance package was worth £473,167, and a further £49,885 was handed to the head of technology, Ian McCall.

Yesterday there was no answer at the £750,000 detached Georgian property that Mrs Williamson, 51, shares with her husband Peter, 68, and son Thomas, 16, in Arkholme on the border of the Lake District.
