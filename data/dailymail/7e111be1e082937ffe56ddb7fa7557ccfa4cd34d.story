Michael Schumacher is to continue his road to recovery from severe head injuries following a skiing accident in December from his home in Switzerland.

In June this year Schumacher was moved from a hospital in Grenoble, where he had been cared for since the end of December following the accident, to the University Hospital in Lausanne.

After eight weeks at the Lausanne facility, it has now been decided Schumacher will make the short 25-mile journey back to his house at Gland on the shores of Lake Geneva to continue his rehabilitation.

Homeward bound: Michael Schumacher has left hospital and will continue his rehabilitation at his Swiss home

Seven-times Formula One world champion Schumacher has not been home for almost nine months since embarking on a skiing holiday with his family in the French resort of Meribel.

It was there the accident took place, with Schumacher hitting his head on a rock in a fall that resulted in him being placed in a medically-induced coma for a number of months due to the nature of his head injuries.

Although Schumacher finally emerged from the coma in mid-June, so allowing him to be transferred to Lausanne, progress remains slow, albeit sufficient enough for him to head home.

A statement from Schumacher's manager, Sabine Kehm, read: 'Michael's rehabilitation will continue from now on from home.

'Considering the severe injuries he suffered, progress has been made in the past weeks and months.

'There is still, however, a long and difficult road ahead.

'We would like to extend our gratitude to the entire team at CHUV Lausanne for their thorough and competent work.

'We ask the privacy of Michael's family continue to be respected, and that speculation about his state of health is avoided.'
