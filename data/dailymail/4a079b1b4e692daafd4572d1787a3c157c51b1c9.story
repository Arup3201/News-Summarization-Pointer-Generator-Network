A cancer victim endured agonising head freezing sessions cooling her scalp to -4C to save her hair from gruelling chemotherapy.

Shelley Cain opted for the painful treatment after her 10-year-old daughter Ruby begged her not to go bald.

The 38-year-old vowed to fight for her life and her looks, after breaking the news of her breast cancer to her two children.

Mrs Cain had to endure three hour sessions of the 'cold cap' treatment, which doctors warned was hit-and-miss, not guaranteeing its success.

Mother -of-two Shelley Cain, 38, endured painful 'cold cap' treatment, freezing her head to -4C during her chemotherapy to save her looks after promising her daughter Ruby, she wouldn't lose her hair

The 38-year-old from Hertford, was diagnosed with breast cancer in June last year. She said she vowed to fight for her life and her looks after telling her two children, Ollie, six, and Ruby, 10 (pictured left with their mother)

The therapy stops hair loss from the cancer-killing drugs by cooling the head to -4C.

It meant the HR worker retained a full head of hair, as well as her eyebrows, throughout her treatment.

Mrs Cain said she forced herself to get out of bed, get dressed and put on make-up every day to stop her feeling like a cancer patient.

And she now credits her stringent beauty regime with helping save her life, keeping her sane and positive throughout the process.

The 38-year-old, who is also mother to Ollie, six, said: 'I didn’t want it to look like I was dying to my children.

'I screamed for the cancer nurse to remove the cap when she first put it on as it was unbearably cold and painful.

'But I was so determined to stay looking well for her kids, it got me through the pain.

'I didn’t want to scare my children by looking ill and losing my hair. I wanted them to recognise their mummy and not be frightened by my appearance.'

She added: 'It wasn’t easy. If I looked in the mirror and recognised myself then I didn’t feel like a cancer patient, it helped me beat the cancer.'

Mrs Cain, of Hertford, who is married to project engineer Richard Cain, also 38, was diagnosed with cancer in her left breast in June 2013.

She  said she tried to play the illness down to her children - but they had seen a family friend die of the condition and were 'devastated'.

Doctors were positive about the diagnosis and told her she would probably just need an operation to remove the lump.

But when tests revealed cancerous tissue had been left behind, Mrs Cain was told she would need to undergo chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

To ease the blow she promised not to lose her hair and went through the gruelling cold cap therapy, for all six of her two-hour chemotherapy sessions.

The process was so severe it left blocks of ice on her head.

And the mother-of-two was told she had to be really gentle with her hair, only washing it once a week as well as avoiding brushing or blowing dry it.

Now, eight months after her treatment, Mrs Cain is in remission and no longer needs treatment.

She said: 'Ruby was terrified that I would lose my hair. She’d seen a cancer patient before and it really scared her that I would look that ill.

'But thanks to the cap, my kids didn’t really notice any difference in me and I still read them a bedtime story every night and looked like their mummy.

'The last few chemo sessions were particularly painful but I still persevered with the cap.

'I'm sure not losing my hair helped me to keep my spirits up. More importantly, it meant the children could recognise the mummy they loved, which took away a lot of their fear'

'Psychologically, I’m sure not losing my hair and eyelashes helped me to keep my spirits up.

'More importantly, it meant the children could recognise the mummy they loved - which took away a lot of their fear.'

Dr Bessam Farjo, co-founder of the Farjo Hair Institute and Medical Director of the Institute of Trichologists, said hair loss can be particularly traumatic while battling disease.

'For women, losing their hair can drastically alter their sensuality and how they perceive themselves - typically leading to a plummet in confidence,' he said.

'Many women question whether their partner still finds them attractive, while others may become socially reclusive as they fear people may notice their thinning hair.'
