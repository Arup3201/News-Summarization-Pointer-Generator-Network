An Australian lawn bowls player has caused a social media 'storm' after he hid in a box to avoid the Glasgow rain.

Kelvin Kerkow, 45, was spotted by thousands of viewers hiding inside the container as Scotland took on England at Kelvingrove Lawn Bowls Centre.

As others watching the match put up their umbrellas and hoods, Mr Kerkow was seen by both those watching the match live and on their televisions at home, cramming himself into the small box while trying to close the lid.

Twitter: The image of Kerkow peering out from inside the small bin was quickly shared across social media

The Australian lawn bowls teams coach Steve Glasson posted an image of Kerkow trying to hide in the bin online and said: 'Look at this clown will you. Kelvin Kerkow in the bag box as the rain comes down'

Despite having enjoyed sunny skies with temperatures in the high twenties last week, yesterday Glasgow was once again raining and with the temperature failing to rise out of the teens.

This was a stark contrast to Mr Kerkow’s home in Australia where Darwin is set for 'winter' temperatures to reach up to 35 degrees, and even Sydney expected to be in the high twenties.

The Australian lawn bowls team’s coach, Steve Glasson, posted a picture to his Twitter page and said: 'Look at this clown will you. Kelvin Kerkow in the bag box as the rain comes down.'

Viewers watching the match on television were also quick to grab a picture of Mr Kerkow and post them on social media.

alongside his picture of his television screen with Mr Kerkow peering 
out from the box.

While Darren Lamb said: 'Okay? Watching lawn bowls for the first time to see this.'
