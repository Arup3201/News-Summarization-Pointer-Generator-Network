England rugby bosses were criticised today after they unveiled a new £91 replica jersey – 10 months before they launch another.

The shirt, which is made by Canterbury, will be used by the national team in the forthcoming Autumn internationals and next year’s Six Nations tournament.

But Rugby Football Union (RFU) sources today confirmed that another shirt would go on sale next July in time for the sport’s world cup, which is being held in England.

Under the tournament’s rules, all teams must remove sponsorship logos and attach a Rugby World Cup 2015 badge while taking part. Every country taking part will therefore have to change their strips by September.

It means the England rugby team will only wear the ‘Test’ shirt for around 12 matches before switching again.

The manufacturers brought out three other ‘Pro’ and ‘Classic’ official jerseys at £56 each that are also replicas, but not made to the same standards as the ‘Test’ strips the players wear.

Critics argue the price and short shelf-life of the new shirts will put struggling parents under pressure with demands from children to keep up with the latest kit.

It comes after David Cameron called for a ‘re-think’ when the England football team unveiled a £90 replica football shirt before this year’s World Cup.

The price was not changed despite the Prime Minister saying fans would ‘welcome’ the Football Association and Nike reconsidering the hefty costs, which were branded by some as a ‘rip-off’.

Former England rugby captain Fran Cotton, who part-owns the clothing company Cotton Traders, said: ‘It’s a lot of money for a short-term shirt. That’s the bottom-line.

‘I don’t think a lot of parents will buy this shirt and then another in 10 months’ time. It’s amazing the pressure parents are put under by their children to buy them.

‘It’s a hell of a lot of money to pay for this new shirt and I don’t think it will be very comfortable to wear while watching the games in the pub.’

The new shirt’s design has not changed much from the previous one launched last September, apart from moving the English Rose badge from the left to the centre.

Suppliers Canterbury claim the ‘Test’ jersey costs more because it is made from more flexible polyester and elastane fibres, has increased strength around the arms to prevent ripping and a small ‘loop’ collar. 

It also has a ‘ball deadening’ rubber grip chest panels that allegedly help players keep hold of the ball.

The RFU also released a scarlet alternate kit, which England will wear against Samoa on November 22 

Demand for the tickets for next year’s Rugby World Cup saw queues on the online ticket system when the sales window last week.

Over-subscribed games will be decided via a ballot after the sales window shuts on September 29.

Prices for adults range from £15 for low-profile group games up to £715 for the best seats at the final at Twickenham. The cheapest adult ticket to watch an England group game at the same stadium will be £75, and £50 for their match against a play-off winner in Manchester.

RFU chief commercial & marketing officer Sophie Goldschmidt said: ‘As rugby develops, especially at the elite end, there a requirement for a shirt that is technically advanced from a performance and strength perspective and so we develop new kits for the England team season by season.

‘Many fans want to show their support for the team by wearing the latest kit so we make it available for them. 

'Prices for this season’s kit are the same as last. Every penny made or saved at the RFU is put back into rugby. So all revenues from sales of our shirts will be ploughed back into the game as part of our £27m-plus investment in the grassroots every year.’
