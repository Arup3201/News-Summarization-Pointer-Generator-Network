Sydney siege survivor Louisa Hope has turned down the chance to tell her story on national television, despite significant financial offers, because she doesn't want to 'exploit' the incident which saw three people killed.

Ms Hope, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, has also closed down a funding account to help aid her medical bills, refusing to talk about the deadly attack.

The former bank executive was used as a human shield by Man Haron Monis during the ordeal, and was shot in the foot during the dramatic end of the siege when Tori Johnson and Katrina Dawson died.

Ms Hope was allegedly picked by the self-styled sheikh as she could not put up a fight, as her MS drains her of energy and the ability to walk.

Originally from Moruya on the far south coast of New South Wales, Ms Hope, 50, and her mother, Robyn, were having coffee at the Lindt Cafe in Martin Place on Monday morning.

Robyn, 68, has been noted for her bravery during the siege, refusing to leave her daughter and eventually injured from a shot to the shoulder, reported The Daily Telegraph.

Ms Hope's stand against media interviews comes in the wake of a series of promotional videos in which many of the other siege victims recount their terrifying ordeal.

'She doesn’t want to be seen to be exploiting the situation and is really appropriate in what she does,' Craig Wallace, president of People with Disability Australia, told The Daily Telegraph.

'She already has to walk with a cane, and she is going to need a lot of support to get her back on her feet,' Mr Wallace said.

Under the NSW Victims Rights and Support Act 2013, Ms Hope and her mother are only entitled to $1500 of compensation, and up to $30,000 for medical compensation.

Both Channel Seven and Channel Nine have secured exclusive interviews with several of the survivors, some of whom were reportedly paid up to $1 million for their stories.

Siege victim Marcia Mikhael, who suffered shrapnel wounds to her legs, is believed to have secured a deal of between $350,000 and $400,000 to tell her story to the Seven Network, as the commercial rivals opened up their cheque books to secure survivors for their respective upcoming specials.   

The networks have been so desperate to snare the best stories for their head-to-head broadcasts, they have been sending out their stars to 'door knock' the 16 survivors to convince them to tell-all.

One of the first to escape, John O'Brien, 83, who was seen running from the Lindt Cafe in Sydney's Martin Place with barrister Stefan Balafoutis, will also speak on the Seven program. He's rumoured to have signed on for $100,000.  

Meanwhile, Channel Nine's 60 Minutes special is believed to feature up to 10 survivors who escaped after being held by crazed gunman Man Haron Monis for almost 17 hours.  

Gunman Man Monis told hostages they had '15 minutes' to live as the Sydney siege reached its tragic climax inside the Lindt Cafe last December

60 Minutes has yet to announce when the program will go to air but the promotional videos are tagged 'Coming Soon'.

The network told Daily Mail Australia: 'The siege story will (also) include interviews with two staff members of the Lindt Café who were held hostage during the siege: Fiona Ma and Harriette Denny.'

'At least another six survivors will be interviewed for the story.'

Among those believed to have also been signed by Nine are Joel Herat and Jarrod Morton Hoffman, the sum total of all the interviews thought to be nudging $1 million. 

Daily Mail Australia understands the rival specials were set to air on Sunday February 1, which is the week when the television ratings season kicks off, rather than Australia Day as has previously been claimed. This would be after the coronial inquest starts on January 29.
