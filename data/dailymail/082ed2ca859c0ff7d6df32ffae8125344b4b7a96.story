Troubled former England footballer Paul Gascoigne has been pictured appearing to carry a bag with a bottle of gin inside just days after insisting he was healthy.

The 47-year-old, who was briefly sectioned for his own safety in October, has had a lengthy battle with alcohol and drugs.

But just last week while appearing on BT Sport's Matchday Live With Fletch and Sav show, he insisted that he hadn't fallen off the wagon and wasn't drinking again.

The midfielder, who retired from football in 2004, was wearing a coat, but no shirt, and also appeared to have sores around his mouth

Gascoigne was also pictured going into an Oddbins off licence and posing for a photograph with a member of staff and a bottle of lemonade 

However, a week on from his successful TV appearance, new pictures have emerged showing Gascoigne walking close to his home in Poole, Dorset, clutching a bag containing what looks like a bottle of gin.

The midfielder, who retired from football in 2004, was wearing a coat, but no shirt underneath, and appeared to have sores around his mouth.

He was also pictured going into a local Oddbins off-licence and posed for a photograph with a member of staff and a bottle of lemonade.

The new pictures come as the former Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United star recently joked about his addiction problems saying: 'I've been on a whiskey diet – I lost three days!'

The star, put his recent stint in hospital following an apparent alcohol binge down to 'just to a little blip'

The 47-year-old, who was briefly sectioned for his own safety in October, has had a lengthy battle with alcohol and drugs

The star, who put his recent stint in hospital following an apparent alcohol binge down to 'just to a little blip', insisted other photos of him shopping in a off-licence last month didn't mean he had resorted to his old habits.

He told TV presenters Robbie Savage and Darren Fletcher on the BT Sport show: 'I was only buying cigarettes.'

As well as making light of his dark times, the footballer also touched on the struggles of being in the spotlight.

Just last week, Gascoigne appeared in good spirits on BT Sport's Fletch and Sav show and joked about his alcohol problems 

Gascoigne, who retired from football in 2004, was joined by fellow guest Russell Brand on the show and opened up about his struggles with alcoholism

He told fellow guests Jimmy Greaves and Russell Brand how his fundamental aim on a football pitch was to 'entertain the fans, win them over', but admitted that sometimes it all became too intense for him.

He also admitted that even today 'it's sometimes hard to go to games' because he ends up 'analysing myself.'

He added: 'I drive myself nuts. What would I have done there?'

In December last year, Gascoigne was spotted popping to an off-licence in east London, although it wasn't clear whether he bought anything at the store.

The former England, Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle footballer was also spotted emerging from an off-licence in east London in December last year. However, it was clear in the photos that he didn't buy alcohol 

Last year, the ex-footballer was spotted looking downcast as he put the bins out outside his home in the wealthy Sandbanks area of Poole, Dorset, wearing a blue dressing gown, tartan pyjama bottoms and slippers

While a month earlier he was pictured looking downcast as he put the bins out in front his property in the wealthy Sandbanks area of Dorset, wearing a blue dressing gown, tartan pyjama bottoms and slip-on shoes.

The former professional footballer was hospitalised in October last year, during which he was placed on a three-day emergency detox.

The star, who made 57 appearances for England, was first sectioned under the Mental Health Act in 2008 following an incident at a Newcastle hotel.

His latest sectioning in the early hours of October 24 came following an apparent alcohol binge.

During his time in hospital, he is said to have taken the opportunity to improve his health and fitness by doing up to 800 press-ups, sit-ups and squats every day.

Gascoigne, who now prays every morning, claimed he had only drunk for one year out of the last 18 and admitted he was lucky to have nipped his relapses in the bud quickly.

Last month, he admitted that 'the only person who can save me is me', and vowed to stay on the straight and narrow after listening to doctors' warnings that alcohol will kill him.
