A martial arts fighter was left horrified and embarrassed after the tattoo he had inked on his forearm to honor his grandmother was written backwards.

Quinten Wyland, from Oregon, had to pay nearly $400 to correct the mistake.

'It wouldn't be so bad if it was 
something else,' Mr Wyland said. 'It'd still be really bad, but 
for my grandma's name, that's the worst.'

Mistake: Quinten Wyland says it was impossible to read his grandmother's name on the original tattoo

He told KATU that his grandmother, 
Grace, had given him strength and support. After her death, Mr Wyland 
decided that a tattoo of her name would be a fitting tribute. He had the
tattoo put on his forearm so opponents in martial arts contests would 
be able to see it clearly.

One
the day Mr Wyland went to Oregon City to get his tattoo he ran into a 
family friend who had recently received his tattoo license.

James
Langholz offered to do the tribute tattoo for only $40 - a huge 
discount for Mr Wyland who had expected to pay more than $100.

At first everything seemed to be fine. Mr Wyland approved the sketch that Mr Langholz had drawn, telling KATU: 'It said my grandma's name, "Grace", in cursive.'

He says that the tattoo was in an awkward place on his arm so when the sketch was put on he couldn't see what it said.

But it wasn't until Mr Wyland was proudly showing off the tattoo to a friend later that night, that the problem was spotted.

'I was just completely embarrassed,' he said.

The
tattoo artist says that he followed the design his customer had 
requested, adding that Mr Wyland had approved the sketch on his arm 
before he started work on it.

Error: Quinten Wyland's plans for a tribute tattoo to his dead grandmother, Grace, went wrong

'It says G-r-a-c-e, you can't deny 
that,' he said, adding that the letters were correct and blaming the 
complaint on buyer's remorse.

'If he wants it that way then that's the way he gets it, because that's the way he likes it,' Mr Langholz said.

Mr
Wyland, who has lodged a complaint with the Oregon Health Licensing 
Agency, was forced initially to wear long sleeves to cover up the 
mistake, and has since had a cover up tattoo to remove it.

'When it's, like, my grandma's name, it brings up a lot of memories and stuff. Not the way I wanted it to be,' Mr Wyland said.

Mr Wyland is not the first person to be horrified at the results of a tribute tattoo.

Last
year a Canadian tattoo parlor in Halifax was ordered to pay $9,000 in 
damages for a spelling error in a tattoo it had created for a grieving 
woman.

Marie Huckle had asked Newcombe's Ink to do a tattoo  in memory of her friend, that read: 'See You at the Crossroads'.

But a spelling error resulted in the tattoo reading: 'See you at the cossroads', CBC News said.

The
owner of the tattoo parlor refunded her money and offered to fix the 
mistake, but Ms Huckle decided to remove the tattoo with laser 
treatment.

She needed more than 20 sessions, which were painful and expensive, to fix the error.

Cover up: Quinten Wyland has had to pay for a new tattoo to cover over the previous mistake on his forearm

Removing a tattoo is not easy and even with advances in laser treatment, the process will be costly and time consuming.

'Laser removal is the standard of care,' Dr Paul Jarrod Frank, the director of a New York laser center, told CNN, but he added: 'There is no great treatment.'

The success of laser treatment also depends of the colors in the tattoo and the skin tone of the patient.

Many people chose the option Mr Wyland took however, which is to get a second tattoo put over the mistake.

The Oregon Health Licensing Agency, which is responsible for tattoo artists, says that complaints about designs has risen in the past few years, as more people opt to get a tattoo.

A license is no indicator of the quality of a tattoo artist's work, the agency warned. It suggests that customers examine the artist's past work, look closely at the stencil, and bring a friend along for a second opinion.

However, in Oregon the licensing agency does ask trainee artists to complete 360 hours of training, and to complete 50 tattoos under supervision before being eligible to apply for a license.

The state charges $50 for a license, and the tattoo artists must prove they have first aid knowledge and blood borne pathogen training.
