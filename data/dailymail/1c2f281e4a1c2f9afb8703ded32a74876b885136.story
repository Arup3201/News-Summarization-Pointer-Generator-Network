Sydneysiders may be the biggest coffee snobs, but it's Melbourne that can claim to have the best cafe culture.

Research into the nation's caffeine habits by Roy Morgan Research found there's nothing more Australians love than fresh coffee, with the average person's café visits increasing by three per cent between 2010 and 2014.

Although Sydney was found to have the highest number of people buying fresh coffee and the lowest percentage of people purchasing instant coffee, the Harbour City proved not to be the national coffee capital.

Instead, it's Melburnians which can proudly claim the title, with 63.3 per cent of people aged 14 and over visiting a café for coffee or tea in an average three month period.

This was followed closely by Sydney at 61 per cent and Hobart at 62.7 per cent.

Melbourne residents were also found to visit cafes more frequently with 11.5 per cent of people going 16 or more times in a three-month period.

The Harbour City proved not to be the national coffee capital: Sydney's Cornersmith cafe in Marrickville won The Good Food Guides's best cafe award in the city in 2014

'With a higher café visitation rate than any other capital city, Melburnians take their coffee very seriously,' Roy Morgan Research's Group Account Director, Angela Smith, said.

'And perhaps because so many of them count on their barista for their caffeine fix, Melbourne residents don't need to buy as much fresh coffee for home/work consumption – which is where Sydneysiders lead the country.'

Meanwhile, instant coffee's popularity is steadily decreasing across the country according to the research which also found an 8.7 per cent rise in the number of households with coffee makers.

Perth residents are particularly fond of their home brews with the capital city recording the highest rate of coffee-maker ownership at 39 per cent.

'While a much higher proportion of Aussies still buy instant coffee than fresh, its popularity has been declining for several years,' Ms Smith said.

'However, all is not lost: instant-coffee brands Moccona and Robert Timms are actually bucking this downward trend, with higher purchase rates in 2014 than in 2010. Meanwhile, Lavazza maintains top spot among the fresh coffee brands.'
