A Canadian teenager is giving impersonators a run for their money with his pitch-perfect rendition of the King's Blue Christmas. 

Armed with his guitar like a young Presley, David Thibault, 16, sings the classic song to gobsmacked radio station staff at CKOI Quebec. 

Close your eyes and the French-Canadian singer's voice is uncannily similar to the King of rock and roll.

The King lives: David Thibault performed Blue Christmas on a radio show which shocked presenters

He even has the same mannerisms and iconic black quiff.

Blue Christmas was written by Billy Hayes and Jay W Johnson and is a tale of unrequited love during the holidays.

The song was first recorded by Doye O'Dell in 1948 but Elvis made it his own in 1957 for his LP Elvis' Christmas Album which secured the song as a Christmas classic. 

In 1999 Low covered the song on their album Christmas. 

Even before Elvis died, there were 185 Elvis impersonators worldwide.

Thirty six years on there are more than 200,000 and the numbers are rising.

As the Reverend Steve Caprice - winner of Best Gospel Award 2007 - put it: 'If things carry on like this, by 2020, one in four people will be an Elvis Tribute Artist.'

Similarities: The French-Canadian singer's voice is uncanny to the King of Rock and Roll

Impressed: The presenters clapped after the 16-year-old finished performing the song

Born on January 8, 1935, in Tupelo, Mississippi, Elvis Presley came from very humble beginnings and grew up to become one of the biggest names in rock 'n' roll.

By the mid-1950s, he appeared on the radio, television and the silver screen.

Elvis was found dead on his bathroom floor at the age of 42 at his Memphis mansion Graceland in August 1977. 

Elvis Presley

I'll have a blue Christmas without you

I'll be so blue just thinking about you

Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree

Wont be the same dear, if you're not here with me

And when those blue snowflakes start falling

That's when those blue memories start calling

You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white

But I'll have a blue, blue blue blue Christmas(instrumental break)You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white,

But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas
