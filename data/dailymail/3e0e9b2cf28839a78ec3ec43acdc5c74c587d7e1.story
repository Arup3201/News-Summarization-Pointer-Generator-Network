The British arm of an elite American fraternity - which counts presidents including Bush and Ford among its Alumni - is being probed over claims members made jokes about rape at a meeting.

As reported in The Student, brothers of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity at Edinburgh University allegedly made jibes about raping members of the feminist society, including going for a 'raping trip'.

According to minutes from the meeting, members of the frat - known as Deke - suggested a 'phone a Deke' service to escort drunk women home from campus, and allegedly made offensive comments about transgender people.

The Edinburgh branch of Delta Kappa Epsilon is the only UK branch of the historic American fraternity which was founded at Yale in 1844.

The scandal, which could see the branch closed down, comes less than a week after they were officially recognised as a chapter of the DKA fraternity.

The offensive comments were reportedly made by the all-male group during the discussion of an agenda item labelled 'Feminists'.

One frat member suggested organising a game of paintball with the Feminist Society to 'calm the waters' after the group spoke out against a brnach of DKE being established.

Another member vetoed the motion, prompting the proposer to ask: 'How are we going to rape them?' before a second member added: 'Let’s go to Montenegro, for a raping trip.'

A member of the fraternity also joked that a female EUSA official had raped his friend in Florida, before another member responded: 'She didn’t need a strap-on!'  

Among the Alumni of the elite fraternity are Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and George W. Bush, along with Sidney Souers, the first director of the CIA, and Briton Hadden, who co-founded Time Magazine

Delta Kappa Epsilon claims to have 44,000 'brothers' in 54 active chapters across North America and five former US Presidents are members.

Vice President Societies & Activities at EUSA, Eve Livingston said: 'We were alerted to the existence of minutes from a "Delta Kappa Epsilon" fraternity meeting which detailed discussions of rape threats, transphobia and other unacceptable content.

Founded in 1844 by fifteen students at Yale, Delta Kappa Epsilon was designed to give members companionship, allies in college politics, and help with studies.

Members had to prove that they were a 'gentleman' to be considered for entry, with the ideal candidate combining 'in the most equal proportions the gentleman, the scholar, and the jolly good-fellow.'

The frat, along with its identity pin and secret handshake, established itself on campuses around America, and now has 44,000 members in 54 chapters.

Among its most famous Alumni are Presidents Bush junior and senior, Theodore Roosevelt, Rutherford Hayes, and Gerald Ford.

Sidney Souers, the first director of the CIA, Briton Hadden, co-founder of Time Magazine, and Charles Alton Ellis, who designed the Golden Gate Bridge, were also members.

In recent time the frat has courted controversy, with the Yale chapter suspended after members were recorded marching across campus chanting pro-rape slogans. 

'Kappa Delta Epsilon have no affiliation with EUSA.

'We as an organisation, alongside NUS Scotland, have publicly condemned them in the past, commenting on the dangerous and misogynistic nature of fraternities which have no place in our student community.

'We are shocked and appalled by the contents of the leaked minutes and our priority is absolutely the welfare and safety of our students.

'As of this morning I have raised the issue with the University Secretary as a breach of the Code of Student Conduct and a potential criminal offence, and I await an official response from the University.

'Students have my assurance that finding and disciplining those responsible for these unacceptable comments and threats will remain a top priority until this is resolved.'

A message on the Edinburgh University Feminist Society Facebook page said: 'FemSoc condemns in the strongest terms the abhorrent misogynistic and transphobic behaviour and statements made by the DKE frat.

'We hope the university will join us in standing up against sexism and take disciplinary action against students involved in the frat.

'We plan to take further action on this issue to make sure the Frat cannot continue to operate on this campus.'

The Yale branch of the fraternity is also currently suspended after members were recorded walking across campus chanting 'no means yes' in 2011.
