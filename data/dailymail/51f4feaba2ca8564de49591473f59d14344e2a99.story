It is less than 12 hours since Simon Cowell and his girlfriend Lauren Silverman welcomed their son, Eric, into the world.

But that has not stopped mocked-up photos of the newborn baby from going viral.

One image sees the child sporting the X Factor judge's trademark high-waisted style and hairy chest.

Just like dad? This mocked-up photo of Simon Cowell and Lauren Silverman's newborn baby features the X Factor judge's trademark high-waisted style and hairy chest. The child also sports a mass of thick black hair

Cheeky: Meanwhile, another photo features Cowell's face digitally merged onto the body of a small child. If the image is anything to go by, the music mogul's baby sports ginger hair, bushy eyebrows and even a stubbly chin

Parents: Silverman, pictured with Cowell, gave birth to baby Eric, weighing 6lbs 7oz, at 17.45 EST yesterday

The baby can be seen posing in a white nappy pulled up above his waist - with a mass of black hairs sprouting from his upper body.

He also appears to have inherited his 54-year-old father's thick black haircut - a far cry from the fine or non-existent hair typically seen on newborn babies.

Another photo features Cowell's face digitally merged onto the body of the tot.

If the cheeky image is anything to go by, his baby sports ginger hair, bushy black eyebrows and even a stubbly chin.

New father: Cowell revealed on Twitter hours after the birth that he had named the child after his own deceased father, Eric Cowell. Above, the new father leaves Lennox Hill Hospital in New York following the birth of his son

Delighted: Cowell catches some fresh air outside the hospital wearing a trench coat, blue jeans and a grey coat

And another image is likely to cause the music mogul even more alarm - with the child featuring the face of his fellow X Factor judge, Louis Walsh.

The bizarre photos have been reposted on Twitter hundreds of times over the past 12 hours - and have even been retweeted by celebrities, such as Lord Alan Sugar.

Alongside the image, Lord Sugar wrote: 'The new baby of @SimonCowell' - adding: 'He is out looking for high waisted nappies'.

Anticipation: Cowell smokes a cigarette as he arrives at hospital prior to his son's birth on Valentine's Day

Missing out: Simon will not be attending Britain's Got Talent auditions on Friday due to flying to New York

SIlverman gave birth to baby Eric, weighing 6lbs 7oz, in New York City at 17.45 EST (10.45 GMT) on Valentine's Day.

Cowell later revealed on Twitter that he had named the child after his own deceased father, Eric Cowell, who passed away in 1999 of a heart attack.

Yesterday, a source told MailOnline: 'Lauren's mother and sister were in the delivery room with them when she gave birth. Simon's mother, Julie, is looking forward to meeting the baby in the UK.'

Hospital dash: Silverman wasn't initially scheduled to be admitted to Lenox Hill Hospital for another two weeks

Blooming: A heavily pregnant Silverman was last seen with 54-year-old Cowell on January 9 in St Barts

Close: Lauren wanted to be in New York so she her mother could fly in and be with her and the newborn

Cowell tweeted just hours later: 'Very happy to say Eric was born at 17.45pm. Healthy and handsome.' He added an explanatory note: 'Named after my dad'.

Following the much-anticipated birth, Cowell was spotted catching some fresh air outside Lennox Hill Hospital.

He looked in high spirits as he wore a trench coat, blue jeans and leather boots.
