This is the luxury Tuscan villa David Cameron is renting for his first ‘proper’ foreign holiday since becoming Prime Minister.

The Camerons will leave the UK soon for a fortnight in the lush Italian hills after Samantha discovered the rustic 18th century villa on a holiday website.

The region was until recently a favourite holiday destination of Tony Blair, and ‘Tuscan Tony’ was regularly under fire for accepting free stays in villas.

Downing Street aides were yesterday keen to stress the Camerons will be paying the market rate for their holiday.

They are flying out on a budget 
airline and are sharing the grand 11,000-euro-a-week mansion on the 
Petrolo Estate with two families who are old friends.

The Camerons’ third share of the bill comes to £5,800.

Tuscany holds a special place in their heart as it is where the couple first laid eyes on each other during a holiday in 1992.

Plenty of holiday books: The well-stocked reading room

Situated near the town of Mercatale 
Valdarno, the Petrolo Estate is in the heart of the Chianti region, so 
popular with British holidaymakers it has been dubbed ‘Chiantishire’, 
and it is also close to the city of Florence - the name given to their 
youngest daughter.

She was born last year while the Camerons were on an ‘austerity’ staycation in Cornwall.

This year, aides have told the Prime 
Minister he has done enough to show he is tightening his belt in the 
wake of the economic downturn, and can eschew the ‘hair shirt’ British 
summer holiday in favour of getting away from it all for a fortnight in 
the Mediterranean sun.

Time off: David and Samantha Cameron holiday in Ibiza in May

In another break from the Labour 
years, Mr Cameron will not be meeting Silvio Berlusconi, the troubled 
Italian prime minister who became friends with Tony and Cherie Blair.

Last night a Cameron friend said firmly: ‘This is a holiday, not a work trip.’

Earlier this year, David treated his 
wife to a weekend in Granada, Spain, for her 40th birthday, and the 
whole family have enjoyed short trips to Polzeath in Cornwall and the 
Spanish holiday island Ibiza – where Mrs Cameron attended a rave-style 
nightclub.

In Tuscany, the Prime Minister’s party will have free run of the entire villa, which sleeps 19 people and has several bathrooms.

The 300-year-old property has its own
private garden, swimming pool and tennis court and is surrounded by 
high walls and tall cypress trees ensuring total security.

Musician Sting and his wife Trudie 
Styler own a luxurious former hunting lodge nearby, and the estate even 
featured in Jamie Oliver’s cookbook ‘Jamie’s Italy’, in which the 
television chef was photographed making pasta with Adriana, one of the 
housekeepers.

Inside, the villa is decorated with 
antique furniture, crystal chandeliers, marble bathrooms, 
state-of-the-art TV and a full-size billiard table, as well as antique 
and contemporary paintings.

It is surrounded by lush working 
vineyards and olive groves, as well as oak woods which contain roaming 
wild boar, and there are also fishing lakes on the estate.

The estate produces organic wine, 
olive oil, salami and honey, and Marco and Nada, who run it, can 
organise Tuscan cooking lessons in the villa’s spacious kitchen.

Reviews of the estate on the Tripadvisor website are mainly positive, with one recent guest describing it as simply ‘amazing’.

But pitfalls of choosing an old house
were identified by another reviewer, from Wales, who reported ‘several 
problems while we were there: fridge door falling off, leaking showers, 
loos that wouldn’t flush properly’.

The owners said these problems had since been fixed.

When the Blairs visited the area, 
they stayed with Italian aristocrat Prince Girolamo Strozzi. During one 
free stay on an estate near Pisa, Mr Blair was accused by locals of 
being a ‘scrounger’ after he left a paltry tip during a dinner at a 
restaurant.

In the middle of 1992, Mr Cameron met
his wife in Tuscany when she came on their family holiday because she 
was a friend of David’s sister Clare. The Camerons were celebrating 
David and Clare’s parents’ 30th wedding anniversary.

According to his biographers, Mr 
Cameron set his sights on Samantha and they played tennis together. Mr 
Cameron - despite being a competitive player - took pains not to 
humiliate her. Winning the match was clearly not his aim, and when they 
were back in London, they went on their first date at Kensington Place 
restaurant.

Yesterday Luca Sanjust, who owns the 
Petrolo Estate with his mother Lucia, said: ‘We have known for a few 
months they were coming here but had been asked to keep it quiet.

‘It was booked via an agency and I can assure them that they will have a lovely, relaxing time here.

‘They have exclusive use of a pool 
and tennis courts and there is some beautiful countryside as well as the
historic cities of Florence and Siena nearby.

‘We have an extensive wine cellar 
here, as that is primarily what we do here - make wine - and I would be 
delighted to show him our vineyards and our collection.

‘We also have a group of ladies who can cook traditional Tuscan lunches and dinners if they so wish.’

A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘We never comment on the Prime Minister’s movements.’

During the PM’s absence, and with 
Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg already on holiday in Spain with his 
family, Foreign Secretary William Hague will be left as the most senior 
Cabinet minister in the UK.

But Number 10 insists that Mr Cameron
is always in charge and able to keep up with ‘the details of 
government’ even when on holiday.
