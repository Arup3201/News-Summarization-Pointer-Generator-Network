A lone female protester, who refused to observe an evening curfew at an Occupy Atlanta rally, has been arrested.

Police had warned demonstrators they would move in to Woodruff Park at 11pm on Sunday evening and would arrest anyone who refused to go. Most protestors left peacefully.

But the 23-year-old woman, who was draped in an American flag, had refused to leave, despite being warned three times in English and Spanish. Instead she sat defiantly, eyes closed, until police took her away in handcuffs.

Occupy Atlanta organiser Tim Franzen said having one person protesting was just as powerful as several.

Four other people on bicycles were 
arrested near the park last night - three for traffic violations and one for 
obstruction of a law enforcement officer.

The new wave of arrests come a day after
19 demonstrators were taken to jail by riot police when a rally spilled
onto Atlanta's streets.

Violence has also erupted at other Occupy demonstrations across the U.S. over the weekend.

Several hundred demonstrators again joined the protest on Sunday evening chanting slogans including: 'We're hungry! We're poor! What are you wasting our money for?' as they stood behind barricades surrounding the park. Police had warned they would be enforcing an 11pm curfew.

Occupy
Atlanta had held its general assembly meeting earlier in the evening 
before marching back to the downtown park. Police spokesman Carlos 
Campos said officers were watching. Police issued three warnings to 
leave the park.

'We're just waiting to see if we need to enforce any laws and we stand ready to do so,' Campos said.

Occupy Atlanta organisers remained 
defiant however, saying they planned to camp at the park again, setting 
up yet another potential showdown with police and the mayor.

The latest arrests come as 19
people were taken to jail on Saturday accused of refusing to leave the park 
after curfew or by blocking city roads, police said. Franzen said most 
were released on Sunday, but one other, who was charged with aggravated 
assault and obstruction, is likely to be held until mid week.

Before
Saturday's 11 pm curfew, a crowd of several hundred protesters had set 
up tents at Woodruff Park, the scene of around 50 arrests of 
demonstrators last month. Organisers had said they planned to stay 
overnight despite warnings from the mayor and police that anyone there 
past closing would be arrested.

But as the deadline approached, 
protesters began decamping peacefully. Dozens of officers were on hand, 
herding protesters away from the park's entrances and installing 
barricades around it. A police helicopter flew overhead.

While
most protesters left the park, a few people stayed behind. Many spilled
onto Peachtree Street, a main city thoroughfare, blocking roads. An 
officer on a motorcycle, with its lights and siren turned on, drove into
a crowd marching on the street.

Video
of the incident appears to show two people pushing against the front of
the motorcycle as the engine revs. A scuffle then ensues when a third 
person intervenes.

Police officers in riot gear and on 
horseback filled the street warning protesters to stay on the sidewalk.
The protesters shouted at the officers, chanting slogans including: 
'Shame! Shame!' and 'What about your pensions?' A small group yelled 
more insulting phrases: 'Put the pigs back in their sty, we the people 
occupy,' they chanted.

Protesters
began camping out in Woodruff Park on October 7. Mayor Kasim Reed 
initially issued an executive order allowing them to stay overnight, but
later revoked it after he said there were increasing security concerns.

'Mayor
Reed was clear earlier this week in his public statements that the City
of Atlanta would arrest any persons who violated the law,' Police Chief
George Turner said.

Elsewhere a woman was found dead of a suspected heroin overdose in her tent at Occupy Vancouver over the weekend.

Spelling it out: 19 people were arrested on Saturday accused of refusing to leave the park after curfew or by blocking city roads in Atlanta

The Mayor of 
Vancouver Gregor Robertson called for the camp to be closed down after 
the woman's body was found on Saturday. She was said to be in her 
twenties and found in a tent by another protestor. She was pronounced 
dead upon arrival at hospital.

Hundreds of people have been arrested 
at various Occupy protests across the U.S. in recent weeks, mostly for 
curfew violations. Some of the most intense confrontations between 
demonstrators and police have been in Oakland, California, where two 
Iraq War veterans were hurt in separate clashes with officers.

It has emerged that Kayvan Sabeghi,
the second Iraq war veteran beaten by police during the confrontations 
in Oakland, was not actually a protestor but was simply trying to make 
his way home after having dinner with friends.

The 32-year old was arrested and charged 
with resisting arrest and remaining present at a riot and was only 
hospitalised when he was eventually freed on bail, despite telling 
police he needed medical help.
