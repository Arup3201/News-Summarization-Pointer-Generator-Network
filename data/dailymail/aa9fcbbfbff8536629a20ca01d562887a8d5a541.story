A British couple are to be deported from Australia next month – because they settled in a suburb that was 2 miles and 854.45 yards from where they were told to set up home.

George and Lana Breen today told of their despair at being sent back to Scotland, after migrating to Queensland, 10,400 miles away, five years ago, and each finding jobs that were of benefit to the Australian community.

But under the rules of their migration visa they had to live and work in a specified area.

Strict rules: George and Lana Breen are being deported from Australia after breaching the terms of their visas by moving to an area three miles away from the location they were allocated to live in

Mr and Mrs Breen, from Dundee, settled in the suburb of Calamvale, south of Brisbane, which is less than three miles from Browns Plains, where they were meant to live.

There was good work for the two of them in Calamvale and they were convinced they were doing the right thing in a country that has been asking for skilled and qualified workers.

But the Immigration Department was not happy about their choice of suburb and has invoked a little-known rule that they cannot work in any other place other than that initially specified until such time as their full residency visas are approved.

‘When we heard from the immigration that we’d broken the condition of the visa we were shattered,’ Mrs Breen, who works as a disability care specialist, told Channel Seven’s Today Tonight programme.

‘This was not done intentionally.’ Mr Breen, who is working as a much-in-demand bricklayer, was devastated.

‘We work hard, we’ve put in a lot of money, we’ve set up home here, we’ve got vehicles and this is home,’ he said.

Strict guidelines mean immigrants can't live in anywhere other than the area stated on their visas

Demography expert Dr Bob Birrell said he believed the visa that ‘controlled’ the Breens was created to soothe the nations’ concerns that migrants were flocking to the capital cities while areas that needed workers were being bypassed.

Migrants, he said, weren’t going where they were really needed, so when the Breens were told they had to live in Browns Plains it was expected they would abide by that ruling.

Mr Ian Mulvey, who knows the couple well, said Mrs Breen had been looking after his disabled son for three years.

Skilled workers or professionals must be nominated by a state or sponsored by an eligible relative living in a designated area to be granted a 475 skilled regional visa in Australia.

The visa is valid for four years and only for a designated area in Australia where the applicant's skills are most needed.

Workers are allocated a specific area to work in because of concerns migrants were only flocking to big cities to work and weren't helping to fill gaps in workforce.

After the four years is up, workers can apply for permanent residency if they wish to stay in Australia.

Australia is well-known for its tough stance on immigration.

‘She’s just made a significant difference to his life,’ he told the TV programme.

‘The Australian adage, give someone a fair go…that’s just gone out of the water with all this.’ Mr Greg Robbie, General Manger of the Algester Sports Club, where Mr Breen is a social member, said a petition of 650 had been signed in favour of Mr Breen and his wife staying in Australia.

But the Immigration Department has been unmoved.

‘Their particular visa applies to those working and residing in regional Australia and of course regional Australia is determined in our case by postcodes.’

Mr and Mrs Breen said they thought they had obeyed all the conditions of their 475 skilled regional visa and it wasn’t until they applied for permanent residency in 2011 that they found out they were victims of red tape.

Desperately, they approached real estate agent Tony Cook looking for place to live in the ‘correct’ suburb.

‘At that time, there was not much available and weren’t able to help and passed them onto other agents who also weren’t able to help,’ said Mr Cook.

The Breens appealed to the Migration Review Tribunal but lost their case on the basis that they had breached the terms of their visas.

The TV channel said it was hard not to have some sympathy for the British couple when it was known that other migrants are not prevented from moving into suburbs where people of similar nationalities live.

Dr Birrill gave as examples Vietnamese migrants who gather in three suburbs in Melbourne, the Chinese who tend to move into a particular Sydney suburb, the Indians in another and the Lebanese in three suburbs.

On March 7, said Mr and Mrs Breen, they will be ordered onto a plane and sent back to Scotland.‘We’ve made an awful lot of friends here and to be sent home…I think it’s a bit of a disgrace,’ he said.
