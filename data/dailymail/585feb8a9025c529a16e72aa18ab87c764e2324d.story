These eerie images give a chilling glimpse into a once-bustling city market dating back eight decades that now lies like a ghost town.

The historic building, which dates back to 1928, stands in silence with farewell messages from traders scrawled on the walls where they worked.

Castle Market in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, closed its doors last November - almost a year ago - as the new Moor Market opened in the city.

It is now frozen in time with goods from fake hair to packets of seasoning, shrivelled bananas and Christmas decorations on the shelves and floor.

Clocks stand still and the market’s decommissioned lift slumps at the end of its ropes, with the service corridor in darkness.

Photographers and artists have visited to record the building’s notable features, including its wooden banisters and historic tiles.

Charities have also taken some items, such as mannequins, for their stores - but a red Santa sledge was too big to remove and sits near the entrance.

A bizarre request to hold a zombie event there was turned down for health and safety reasons.

Gary Wright, project manager for Kier, revealed that many unusual items had been left behind in the market.

He said: ‘When we took control of the site there were boxes of Christmas decorations, greeting cards, a vast amount of keys and even fruit and vegetables left behind.

Inside the meat and fish area the stalls still stand, with some peeled apart so the rusty fittings can be seen

It may look like the market has not changed much since it closed but there has been much preparation work going on behind the scenes

One of the first jobs was a basic clean-up, as some perishable stock had been left behind

Survey after survey - from topographical to bats, ecological of the culvert that runs near the site, and even exploration for unexploded bombs - has been undertaken

South Yorkshire Archaeological Service helped with evaluations and a photographer recorded the building in detail for the Sheffield archives

The building is also riddled with asbestos, and one of the biggest jobs was to assess that

‘If you go into the old meat and fish market, you can still smell meat and fish.

‘People who have visited the market since its closure, if they knew the market before, can’t believe it is like time has stood still, because large parts of the inside remain unchanged.’

It may look like the market has not changed much since it closed but there has been much preparation work going on behind the scenes.

One of the first jobs was a basic clean-up, as some perishable stock had been left behind, and the paperwork to gain vacant possession.

Survey after survey - from topographical to bats, ecological of the culvert that runs near the site, and even exploration for unexploded bombs – has been undertaken.

Trial pits and holes have been dug to test the thickness of the concrete - vital for demolition purposes.

A contractor is to be chosen to carry out the demolition after the tender deadline at the end of the month, and it is expected pre-demolition work will begin in December.

‘When people hear the words ‘start on site’ they think a bulldozer will trundle straight in,’ said Mr Wright.

‘What it actually means in the case of Castle Market is that we can hand over to the demolition contractor, at which point they will start planning for the demolition, including how the building will be brought down safely.’

Castle Market is located in the centre of the city, close to the Sheffield Supertram stop of Fitzalan Square - Ponds Forge

The castle on top of which the site now stands was destroyed in 1648 after being seized by parliamentary forces

The building was first constructed in the inter-war period before additions were made later on in the Sixties and Seventies

The demolition work - expected to take 11 months - will begin with asbestos removal, then a ‘soft strip’ to pull out everything that shoppers will remember from the market. Everything that can be recycled will be.

Then the super structure will be demolished down to the concrete, so a careful excavation of the Sheffield Castle ruins underneath can be completed in future.

Mr Wright said a major consideration were the ruins of the former castle as well as shops nearby which are staying open, and there may be some road closures during the work.

The market’s retaining wall will also be kept as it holds back the hill on which the castle was built.

He added: ‘The site is very complex - it is not as straightforward as demolishing a simple two-storey square building.’
