Most clubbers wake up from a night out on the town with a sore head and a few blurry photos.

But two patrons of Carbon nightclub in Galway, Ireland, decided to go one step further and steal the club's welcome doormat before proudly posting the photo on Facebook.

But the club's reaction has been surprising and it has offered the thieves a reward to bring the mat, emblazoned with the club's name, back to the premises.

The nightclub's management wrote on Facebook:  'After much discussion, we have [decided] this horrible debacle must come to an end. These two jokers managed to sneak this mat out past security but if they can sneak it back in, we'll give them a €100 [~$135] bar tab and a free limo and vip entry for their friends.

'BUT if they care caught bringing back in, BARRED for 2 months...So ye feeling lucky punks????..do it!!'

The unusual challenge prompted one of the thieves to hit back at the club with a challenge of his own: 'I see your mat...how much for the rest? 4 posters and a drip mat... #its on #doubleornothing'.

Famous mat: A trio of revellers pose with the mat, although one of them disguises himself with a traffic cone

Then several patrons decided to post their own menentos that they had stolen from the nightclub including posters, a sign and beermats.

One of them even used Photoshop to show them using the mat as a flying carpet.

Since then dozens of patrons have taken to Facebook to discuss the theft.

One user wrote: 'Everyone is going to make it their mission to rob as much as possible out of carbon from now on!'

While another posted: 'They better nail them to the floor cos after this post it will be the weekend challenge to get 1.'

Jonathan Bryne, Carbon Nightclub's Marketing Manager, spoke to Independent.ie about the post.

'We're delighted people are seeing it in the humour it was meant. Galway is a vibrant student town and they're all studying and doing exams at the moment, so it was just a fun thing we came up with to draw attention to ourselves.'

But he said it does not look like the mat will be returned anytime soon.

'The two lads have actually been in touch. They're doing exams at the moment so they called to let us know that they wouldn't be able to even try to sneak the mat back in until after the 20th December.'

But he said the boys willbe assured of a warm welcome when they do return: 'We'll welcome them with open arms. Getting so much feedback is absolutely mindblowing.'
