Two women who went camping in the woods got the fright of their lives - after capturing what they believe is a ghost on camera.

Friends Lola Swan and Kate Channon set up camp in a dense woodland near Bristol but say they became afraid of strange noises nearby.

After fleeing home when they became too spooked to see out the night, the pair noticed a ghostly figure on one of the photos they took.

The 'ghost' is visible in the woods behind the women's campsite, which they fled after hearing a child's voice speaking.

It wasn't until the following morning when Miss Swan, 28, flicked through their pictures of the night that she noticed the apparition in the photo.

She said: 'I immediately threw the phone to the ground. I knew we were being watched and that picture proves it.

'During the night we heard the sounds of what can be only described as people walking around.Twigs and branches were cracking and breaking, like footsteps on the forest ground.'

The pair were camping at Leigh Woods on the outskirts of their home city of Bristol on Monday when the photo was taken.

The women set up camp during the day but as night fell they say they began hearing strange noises and felt like they were being watched.

At one point Miss Channon, 24, whistled out - and was horrified when something whistled back.

They say their hammer went missing during the trip and they heard a child's voice at 1am, which was 'the final straw'.

'After midnight it all got too scary and, in our panic and fear, we packed up our tent and got the hell out of there,' said Ms Swan.

They have likened their experiences to 
the Blair Witch Project, the 1999 horror film which tells the fictional 
story of three students who disappear in woodland which legend claims is
 haunted.
