Disgraced Former Rangers owner Craig Whyte has been arrested in Mexico in a major police raid

Disgraced Former Rangers owner Craig Whyte has been arrested in Mexico in a major police raid, after he failed to attend a London court hearing over a £17million debt.

Two international arrest warrants have been issued  for the 43-year-old businessman in connection with the sale of Rangers Football Club in 2011.

Whyte, who is understood to have been living in the central American country for several months, failed to turn up at the Royal Courts of Justice on November 20, where he was due to appear in a case brought by London-based ticketing agency Ticketus.

The firm gave Whyte almost £27 million to help him buy Rangers when he took control of the club in 2011, with the agreement that Ticketus would be paid back from the revenue from ticket sales.

But Rangers went into administration in February the following year, and Ticketus went to court, alleging that Whyte had had deliberately misled them ahead of entering into their agreement.

Whyte disputed the agency' claims, but in April 2013 a High Court  ruled against him prior to a trial after Ticketus argued that he had 'no real prospect' of mounting a successful defence. He was ordered to pay £17.6 million.

Mr Justice Newey charged Whyte with contempt of court after he failed to appear for the London hearing last week, with a custodial order of 28 days attached to the warrant. 

The Motherwell-born financier had previously vowed to surrender to police and assist officers investigating the Rangers takeover, saying: ‘I will return to Britain at the beginning of December and hand myself in for questioning.’

Following the hearing a spokeswoman for Ticketus said: ‘Today’s court hearing is part of Ticketus’ continued activity to enforce its judgement of April 2013 for damages of £17.7million plus interest and costs against Craig Whyte as it looks to recover funds for its investors.

‘This reflects the total amount Ticketus invested through the ticket purchase agreement it entered into with Rangers Football Club under Craig Whyte’s ownership.

Motherwell-born financier Craig Whyte, who who is understood to have been living in Mexico for several months, has been issued with two arrest warrants in connection with the sale of Rangers  in 2011

‘Ticketus confirms that the court today issued a warrant for Craig Whyte’s arrest, having previously issued a suspended committal order on 29 September returnable today after finding Craig Whyte to be guilty of contempt of court.’ 

A separate second arrest warrant was issued by the Crown Office in Scotland  on charges of fraud in connection with his purchase of the club from Sir David Murray in 2011.

Four men appeared in court earlier this month charged with fraudulent activity linked to the sale of the club three years ago.

Gary Withey, 50, David Whitehouse, 49, Paul Clark, 50, and David Grier, 53, were granted bail following a hearing at Glasgow Sheriff Court.
