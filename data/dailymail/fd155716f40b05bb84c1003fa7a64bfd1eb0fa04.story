She has made a staggering transformation from fresh-faced young model to wild party girl in just a few months.

And Cara Delevingne's latest high fashion campaign conveys that to perfection.

The 20-year-old is the rock chick star of Saint Laurent‘s glam grunge fall collection.

From glam to grunge: Cara Delevingne rocks out for Saint Laurent's latest campaign

With backcombed hair, lashings of black eye make-up and some seriously edgy style, Cara pulls off the look to perfection.

Creative Director Hedi Slimane paired Cara with Z. Cole Smith, a musician with a shaggy hair 'do.

The model duo can be seen leaning 
against window frames, laying out on the floor, and sprawled on a bed 
with an expression that says: 'I haven’t slept in a week.'

The adverts are currently only available in video form and are accompanied by a soundtrack of the Smith’s.

And this isn't the first YSL campaign Cara has starred in, just last month she was announced as the face of YSL beauty's latest campaign.

And
her wild-child persona was in full focus for the video, which saw
her dancing and partying for the camera - all the while looking 
immaculate thanks to the new products she's endorsing.

Leggy: Donning fishnets and grungy chic clothes, Cara most certainly looks the part

In previous weeks - and in the space 
of just five days - Cara has been caught in an alleged drugs scandal, 
partied with A-listers at the Met Ball in New York and jetted off to 
Singapore to hang out with Karl Lagerfeld.

But the world's most sought-after model shows no signs of slowing down or letting her work suffer as a result.

Party animal: Cara has been out and about partying in London in recent weeks and even locked lips with a female friend on Twitter
