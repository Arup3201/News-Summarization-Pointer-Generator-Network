Endless hours of rigorous training, countless repetitive rehearsals to perfect your technique and you fluff your lines on the big stage. A horrifying scene no athlete wants to be part of.

However that's what happened to Russia's unfortunate skeleton slider Elena Nikitina, when she overshot the mark and completely missed her sled in her very first run of the World Championships in Germany.

At the height of her speed in front of an eagerly awaiting crowd, the poor Russian took a tumble and slid down the hill further than a certain Sol Campbell tackle on Ivica Olic when England played Croatia in the Euro 2008 qualifiers. 

It was all going to plan as Elena Nikitina began her first run in the Skeleton World Championships in Germany

However the Russian slider failed to grab on to one of the sled's handles, completely missing her target

We're happy to announce that Nikitina emerged uninjured after her unfortunate episode in Winterberg, only suffering a minor blow to her pride. 

Great Britain's Lizzy Yarnold is on course to completing a career quadruple after setting a new track record on the Winterberg Hochsauerland bobsleigh track. 

Yarnold will look to stay in contention for gold as the women head into the final day of the competition on Saturday.

The 22-year old looks up in dismay as her sled careers toward the finish line without her on board
