A median income family will pay an average total of $245,340 to raise a child from birth up until the time they graduate from high school.

And a large chunk of that sum will be eaten up by childcare.

A study by Child Care Aware - a group that provides resources to parents and caregivers - that was published by CNN Money on Thursday showed that about 15 per cent of a two-parent family's median income will go to daycare.

The most affected areas in the United States are in the northeast.

On average, a family in Massachusetts are spending $16,549 per child, per year for childcare.

Forever rising: A recent Brookings Institution analysis of consumer price data showed that costs of services continue to rise fast but income levels (dotted line) move much slower. Childcare (blue) was the steepest

Literally through the roof: The cost of childcare has increased so exponentially between 1990 and 2013 that it doesn't even fit on this chart

Families in New York are the hardest hit, paying an average of 16 per cent of their combined yearly income.

The situation is understandably worse for families at the poverty line, who can spend up to 85 percent of their income on childcare.

Prices are somewhat lower in the south, with Louisiana coming in at the cheapest, devoting only 7 per cent of their income to having their children looked after.

The study determined that of the 50 American states, 30 of them are paying more for childcare each year than they are college tuition.

The results come after a recent Brookings Institution analysis of consumer price data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which were published by The Huffington Post.

A chart from the analysis shows that while income has slowly increased from 1990 to 2013 - taking a minor plunge around 2008 during the GFC - the price of goods and services have risen steeply.

The most concerning increase was childcare.

In one of the charts, the increase was so severe over the last 23 years it did not fit on the graph.

However - and thankfully - the childcare on the chart includes elementary, high school and college tuition and fees, as well as child care and nursery school, The HuffPost reported.

Not listed on the charts are factors that are cutting into income more than ever, such rent, legal and professional services, and hotel rates.

'These large sectors and the high prices they charge are contributing heavily to the slipping economic position of American households,' the Brookings analysts wrote.
