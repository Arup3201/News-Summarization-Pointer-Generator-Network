Surveillance footage has captured a motorcyclist riding through a busy shopping mall during a police chase.

The unidentified man was seen driving down the escalator at Walmart in Surrey, British Colombia, on February 20 before guiding his way through the store.

He chose the bizarre shortcut after he began speeding down a highway to get away from the authorities.

Crazy: The motorcyclist was picked up by a police helicopter after driving erratically through the streets of Surrey, British Colombia 

Leading the chase: He was spotted by trailing officers veering in and out of cars as he sped along the highway

He then turns off the road and goes into a Walmart, riding down the escalator in front of stunned shoppers 

Police started to follow him after he was spotted driving erratically and veering in and out of cars in a residential area.

A helicopter  started tracking his every move and the pilot relayed information to officers on the ground.

After realizing patrol cars were on his tail, he decided to turn off the road into the parking lot of the mall and head towards the store's entrance.

Shocked officers watching from the helicopter tell the trailing officers to get out of their vehicles and follow him.

As he enters the store, security guards try to chase him down, but just a few seconds later he escapes through another set of doors.

The driver then veers onto a pedestrian footpath towards the nearby highway.

Chase: A security guard rushes after the reckless driver after watching him drive past 

Bizarre: He then makes his way through a set of sliding doors into the main area of the store

Hapless: The guards try desperately to stop him, but he manages to leave the store seconds later 

He is seen speeding along the narrow passage and causes walkers to jump out of his way before turning back onto a residential road.

Minutes later he dumps the bike and flees on foot - avoiding police capture. 

The video ends with a shot of the motorcycle, which bears stickers supporting the Hells Angels. 

Police have told CBC the video was created by an investigator and are looking into how it became public.

The suspect is still on the loose.  

Route: After leaving the store, the helicopter spots him speeding along a pedestrian footpath over a highway
