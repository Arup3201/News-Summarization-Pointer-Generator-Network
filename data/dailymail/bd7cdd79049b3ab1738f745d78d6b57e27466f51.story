A man with a fetish for cutting off women's hair has been convicted by an Italian court for the 1993 murder of a teenager - months after he received a life sentence in Britain for a similar murder in Bournemouth.

Danilo Restivo, who was tried in absentia, was sentenced to 30 years in prison at a court in Salerno near Naples for the death of 16-year-old Elisa Claps.

Her decomposed body was found in March last year hidden on the roof of a church in Potenza, Italy, where she was last seen 18 years ago.

In June, Restivo was sentenced in England to life without parole for killing and mutilating his neighbour Heather Barnett, 48, in Bournemouth in 2002.

The ritualistic murder - in which the mother-of-two's breasts were cut off and strands of hair placed in her hands - echoed the Claps murder.

Restivo, who is serving his sentence in the UK, denied the charges.

Elisa's mother, Filomena, appealed to Restivo to 'tell the truth' about her daughter's death following the verdict.

Restivo's lawyer, Marnio Marinelli, told reporters that they did not expect a guilty verdict, and refused to comment any further.

The court will issue its reasoning within 90 days, at which time the defence can appeal.

Elisa vanished from her hometown of Potenza, south of Rome on September 12, 1993.

Murdered: Heather Barnett who was discovered dead at her house in Bournemouth in November 2002

She was last seen in the Most Holy Trinity church in downtown Potenza with Restivo, an acquaintance who later acknowledged that he had spent about 10 minutes in the church with her before leaving.

Her decomposed remains were discovered in a corner of a hard-to-reach rooftop garret in March 2010 by maintenance workers who had climbed to the roof to fix a leak.

Earlier this year Winchester Crown Court heard Restivo bludgeoned Heather Barnett with a hammer before cutting her throat.

He then cut off her breasts and left a clump of someone else's hair in her right hand and some of her own underneath her left hand in a ritualistic murder.

The Italian then left the body
for Mrs Barnett’s children, Caitlin, then 11, and Terry, then 14, to 
find in the bathroom.

A victim impact statement 
was read on behalf of Caitlin, 19, who described
the ‘horror’ of finding her mother’s body and being told by police that
she was dead.

She said: ‘It was at that moment that I felt as if my heart had been ripped out.

‘I was in a state of complete and utter shock and it took months before I accepted the truth.'

The judge branded Restivo a 'cold, depraved, calculated killer' with a 'sadistic, sexual appetite'.

He lived just 50 yards away from
Mrs Barnett and had visited her six days before the murder to ask 
about having curtains made.

She had told her sister, Denise Le 
Voir, she felt ‘concerned, hassled and distressed’ after Restivo stole 
her house keys.

Restivo falsified alibis on the day 
of the murder – first buying a bus ticket during the morning and later 
altering log-in records at his place of study.

In another bizarre link 
between the cases, jurors heard that 15 women had reported their hair 
being cut on buses and in a cinema in Bournemouth and also in Potenza 
around the time of the murders in 2002 and 1993.
