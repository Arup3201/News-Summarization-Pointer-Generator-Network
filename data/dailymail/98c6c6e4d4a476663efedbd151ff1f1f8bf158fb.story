A marine clock used to help sailors take Charles Darwin around the world as he formed his theory of evolution has sold at auction for £100,000.

The marine chronometer helped Vice Admiral Robert FitzRoy navigate the HMS Beagle around the tip of South America and onwards to the Galapagos Islands during its 1831 to 1836 voyages.

It was during this trip that Darwin, a budding naturalist, formed his  theory of evolution after noticing variations and similarities between living animals and what he believed were fossils of their extinct ancestors.

The clock, mounted in its gimbled mahogany box case, was sold by at auction by Bonhams for £100,900.

Its maker was the highly-regarded Robert Molyneux, a pupil of clockmaker Thomas Earnshaw who was famed for simplifying the production of chronometers.

The revolutionary timepiece enabled sailors to accurately calculate longitude in addition to latitude - this allowed a level of accuracy for the British Admiralty ship not previously possible.

It measures 3.25inches high, by 6.25in wide and 6.25in deep.

The previously unrecorded marine chronometer performed so well during HMS Beagle voyages that the Admiralty purchased it from Vice Admiral FitzRoy in 1837.

It was recorded as being used onboard HMS Irresistible when she was sunk by a mine in Turkey in 1916. It was later listed as lost.

It then re-emerged during World War II onboard a ship used by the Russians on the Pacific route between the US and Vladivostok under the command of Anna Shetinina, said to be the first female commander of an ocean-going ship.

The vendor’s uncle served as a radio operator and was given the chronometer at the end of the war. In turn he presented it to the current owner on his entry to the Vladivostok Marine School of Engineering in 1975.

Darwin's book On the Origin of Species - written based on his findings during the five-year trip on the HMS Beagle - is considered the founding work of evolutionary theory.

Published in 1859, it suggested that species with common ancestry evolve into diverse life forms over long periods of time.

The clock was used by Vice Admiral Robert FitzRoy (illustrated) during multiple voyages in the HMS Beagle. However, it was the ship's second trip which achieved the most fame, due to the research conducted by Darwin while on board

James Stratton, head of Bonhams’ clock department, said: 'This is a fine example of a 19th century chronometer in its own right, but its association with HMS Beagle and Darwin’s epic voyage makes it even more significant and desirable.

'It sold very strongly and we are delighted with the outcome.'

The marine chronometer is the only surviving one from the Beagle voyages made by Robert Molyneux, a well respected chronometer maker.

Chronometers was a technical breakthrough at the time as they allowed mariners to tell the time over long sea voyages by determining longitude by celestial navigation.

However, the value of the marine clock pales in comparison to that of Swiss firm Patek Philippe's 'Supercomplication', a 1925 timepiece that broke records when it sold last month for £15.1million.

In total, the timepiece — with two clock faces, one on each side — has 24 complications.

One shows the phases of the Moon, others the times of sunset and sunrise in New York and even the pattern of the stars each night above Mr Graves’s apartment in the city.

There are complications revealing the days of the week, an alarm, a stopwatch and a perpetual calendar.

The watch is commonly regarded as the most important ever made, the ‘Holy Grail of Horology’.
