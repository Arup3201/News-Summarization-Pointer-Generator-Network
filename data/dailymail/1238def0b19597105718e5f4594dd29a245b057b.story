Two young motorists were caught 'showing off' on CCTV as they raced down a dual carriageway at 144mph shortly after meeting at a go-carting track, a court has heard.

Daniel Richardson and James Burrows were clocked by a police safety camera van as they sped down the busy A road in their high-powered sports cars.

Richardson, 21, was at the wheel of a blue Ford Focus RS closely followed by Burrows, 26, driving a silver Mitsubishi, Lancer Evo.

CCTV footage showed to magistrates in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, showed Richardson, who runs a family pet food company, travelling in front of the convoy with two passengers in his car.

His co-defendant, school joiner Burrows, was seen following close behind with his passenger.

'Richardson told police he and his friends had been to Middlesbrough,' said Prosecutor Samantha Law.

'They had been go-karting and were returning home.

'He had one passenger in his vehicle and accepted he was driving at speed.

'He told the officer he was racing with the vehicle behind.'

The court was told that the southbound carriageway of the A19 near Crathorne, North Yorkshire, was busy at the time of the incident, at midday on November 30 last year, and is often used by slower moving agricultural vehicles.

The pair, both from Leeds, admitted dangerous driving at an earlier hearing.

Busy: The court was told that the southbound carriageway of the road was busy at the time of the incident, at midday on November 30 last year, and is often used by slower moving agricultural vehicles.

Michael Sisson-Pell, for Richardson, said his client felt 'remorse' but denied racing.

He said: 'Prison would be a catastrophe for him, his family, and the employees of his firm who would very likely lose their employment.'

Mike Walsh, for Burrows - who also denied racing - said: 'I do beg for mercy for my client. He has been a fool.'

Richardson and Burrows were spared an immediate jail term, but were both given a four-month sentence, suspended for 18 months, and ordered to carry out 300 hours of community service.

They were also fined £85 each and ordered to pay a £60 victim surcharge, as well as being banned from driving for three years.

Burrows’s parents were in court and his mum held her head in her hands as they were sentenced.

Presiding magistrate John Bacon said: 'You are both equally to blame.

'We have never seen speeds of 144 miles an hour, especially on a duel carriage way in the middle of a Saturday lunchtime.”

He underlined they had been driving at excessive speed, in convoy, and 'showing off'.

He continued: 'The issue of racing came up. We have heard submissions on that. There were passengers on both your cars.

“The first and presiding risk was to the five people in those cars - the risk of fatality was so that the mere suggestion of a rabbit running out could have distracted the driver and there would have been a catastrophe in North Yorkshire.'

Dismissing claims it had been a momentary lapse of judgment on both drivers part he told them: 'You can’t get a car up to 144mph in a heart beat.

'If there is a salutary lesson you have learned it is that you two are only here breathing air because you were fortunate not to have hit something on the A19.'

Leaving court, Richardson said: 'The only message I have for other drivers is - don’t do it.'

North Yorkshire Police’s mobile safety camera manager, Dave Brown, said: 'The sentence sends a clear message as to how seriously the criminal justice system takes such appalling driving.

'The evidence captured by the safety camera shows both vehicles travelling in close proximity at extremely high speed. Any error, no matter how minor, could have been catastrophic for the two drivers, their passengers and other road users.

'The safety camera operator at the time, was utterly astounded by the speed of the vehicles. Members of the public should be allowed to use the roads in safety and should not be put at risk by other, irresponsible and dangerous drivers.

'Our mobile safety cameras are there to help keep the roads safe for all road users and we urge motorists to bear this in mind, drive at appropriate speeds and within the speed limit and do not, under any circumstances use the roads as a racetrack.
