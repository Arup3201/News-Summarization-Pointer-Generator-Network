Hull City goalkeeper Allan McGregor has been ruled out of Saturday’s game with Crystal Palace at the KC Stadium after the recurrence of a shoulder injury.

The Scotland international has been warned to rest the injury amid fears it may need surgery if he continues to play on it.

The 32-year-old has been troubled by discomfort in his shoulder over recent weeks and scans have revealed wear and tear damage.

The keeper may need surgery to address the shoulder problem unless he rests it 

Steve Harper is expected to deputise with Hull’s defence already under scrutiny following a run of 13 goals conceded in the last five games.

McGregor had played in every minute of Hull City’s Premier League campaign this season, a feat matched only by Ahmed Elmohamady.

The 32-year-old will likely be withdrawn from Scotland's squad for their upcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers

The keeper was named in Gordon Strachan’s Scotland squad to face Georgia and Poland in the Euro 2016 qualifiers but is now likely to be withdrawn.

McGregor may yet meet up with the Scotland squad early next week to have the injury assessed but Cardiff’s David Marshall is likely to start.

Hull City’s next game after the international break is at Arsenal on October 18.
