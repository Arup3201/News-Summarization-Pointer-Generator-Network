Romelu Lukaku says he has no regrets in passing up a move to Serie A champions Juventus to sign for Everton in the summer.

The former Chelsea striker arrived at Goodison Park for a club record £28million after attracting interest from a host of European clubs.

Although he has struggled to scale the heights he reached on Merseyside during his loan spell last season - where he scored 16 goals in 33 appearances - the 21-year-old insists he has made the right move.

Speaking to the Sunday People, Lukaku said: 'I thought about Serie A and Juventus because they are a big club. But for me Everton was perfect.

'I'm here and I'm happy. I don't regret any choices I've made. Everton was the best choice I could make as a young player who wants to progress and develop.

Despite only scoring two goals from 10 games this campaign, while Everton are languishing in the bottom three after just one win, the Belgium international believes the Toffees can qualify for the Champions League.

'Everton play good football, we play at the top part of the league and everyone wants to win. We want to show that last year wasn't a fluke.

'Our mission is to get that Champions League slot because it was in our hands last season and we let it slip.'

Lukaku also gave an insight into his private life, which has seen him avoid the usual temptations associated with young Premier League footballers. 

He said: 'I prefer to stay home. I never went out a lot even when I was a kid growing up in Belgium. I've never had a glass of alcohol in my life either. It's out of my comfort zone and I don't know how to act.

'I'm very shy. When people know me, like here at Everton, they know I'm a crazy guy who likes to joke around and tease. But when I don't know you, at first I'm very cold.'
