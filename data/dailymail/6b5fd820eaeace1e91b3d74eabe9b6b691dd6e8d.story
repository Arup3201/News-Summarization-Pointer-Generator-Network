Lauren Patterson's mother Alison said she will fight for justice for her daughter

The mother of a British teacher murdered in Qatar yesterday vowed to ‘fight for justice’.

Alison Patterson said 24-year-old Lauren was having the ‘time of her life’ working in Doha before she disappeared on a night out.

Her body was found dumped in the desert, it emerged yesterday.

Speaking publicly for the first time since the murder, Mrs Patterson, 48, she said it had been ‘extremely stressful’ waiting for forensic results to confirm the body was her daughter’s.

But she praised authorities in the Gulf state for their thorough investigation – which saw police arrest two local men who have now made confessions.

Miss Patterson was about to start her third year as a primary school teacher at Newton British School in Doha.

She was last seen leaving a club in the five-star hotel La Cigale with a female friend at 1.20am on Saturday.

Her family and her boyfriend James Grima – an IT consultant and DJ living in Malta – launched a frantic campaign on Facebook to find her.

But later that weekend Mr Grima posted a message explaining that the search had been called off, as the case was now being treated as a murder investigation.

Fighting back tears, Mrs Patterson’s mother said: ‘Lauren was a wonderful young woman who was having the time of her life in Doha.

‘She had made so many friends. It wasn’t until I came out here I realised just how many people loved her.

‘She loved travel and loved teaching, so this was the perfect job for her.

Lauren's mother said she has been touched by the tributes left to the primary school teacher

‘She always enjoyed being around children. She was a very giving person and loved little people.

‘The Qatari chairman and his wife of the school she taught at said they loved her like a daughter.

‘She recently had a job offer from another school in Hong Kong but turned it down because she liked it so much in Doha.

‘There have been so many people that have put to us as a family how highly they thought of Lauren and loved her, not just in the UK but Qatar and worldwide.

‘I will be staying in Doha for as long as it takes to see that justice is done for my daughter.’

Mrs Patterson, who lives in Kent, has flown to Doha with her brother and will stay there ‘for as long as it takes to see that justice is done’.

Miss Patterson’s uncle Brian Roake said: ‘It has obviously been an extremely stressful time waiting but we know the authorities are doing everything that they can.

‘We have had a high-level meeting with senior officials in Qatar who are leaving no stone unturned.’

He added: ‘We are also very grateful for the assistance from the British Embassy in Doha at this difficult time.’

A statement from Qatar’s interior ministry said: ‘The police have arrested the suspects. The case has been referred to public prosecution.'
