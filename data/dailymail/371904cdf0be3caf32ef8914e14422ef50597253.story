A supergran celebrated her 100th birthday in extreme style by going skydiving then swimming with sharks.

Plucky Georgina Harwood showed age is no barrier when she jumped out of a plane at thousands of feet during the tandem dive near the Melkbosstrand area north of Cape Town.

The video shows the grandma, who was sporting a red jumpsuit, joined in the air by 15 family members and friends to mark her big day.

Daredevil: 100-year-old Mrs Harwood just before she launches herself from a plane to celebrate reaching a century

She can be seen hurtling through the sky at 120mph before landing safely and being handed a well earned glass of bubbly.  

'I'm so glad I did it, a special experience in my life time, I just can't compare it to anything else,' she said, after completing her third ever skydive.

Down to earth: The 100-year-old grandma drifts back to the ground with the help of her skydive instructor

Flying high: The brave pensioner, who completed the jump flanked by friends and family, makes a safe landing

The senior daredevil completed her first jump when she was 92-years-old in 2007. 

Unsatisfied with just one stunt, the thrill-seeking pensioner can then be seen climbing into the dive cage, wearing a wetsuit and goggles.

All smiles: The birthday girl followed up her skydive by going swimming with sharks in Cape Town

Respect: Mrs Harwood said swimming with the sharks, pictured being fed right, was the 'experience of a lifetime'

She shrieks with cold or excitement as she is helped into the cage, which is attached onto the side of a boat, where sharks can be seen circling. 

Reflecting on her shark-infested swim, she said it was 'the experience of a lifetime', later adding 'sharks are having a hard time in the sea' due to overfishing.

She said: 'We are taking the Hake. The poor old sharks are coming in to the coast and getting us which is a very sad thing'.
