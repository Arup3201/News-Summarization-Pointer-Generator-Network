The parents of a boy who killed himself have released pictures of his last hours to tell the bullies who tormented him: ‘Look what you did’.

The heart-rending images show Dylan Stewart unconscious in a hospital bed. Doctors were unable to save the 12-year-old’s life after he was found hanging in his bedroom.

His mother Amanda said he had been picked on for being new at his school and for coming from another town. She said he was attacked a number of times by bullies who branded him ‘Downey’ – a reference to Down’s syndrome, which he did not have.

Tragedy: Dylan Stewart's parents have released this picture of their son taken before his death and have blamed bullies for his attempt to hang himself

Dylan Stewart was found unconscious at home in Telford, Shropshire, in April this year by his mother Amanda, who claims his life was made a misery by other students at school

Mrs
 Stewart hopes the pictures will stop the bullies picking on another 
victim. ‘If it helps save one other child then we’ve achieved 
something,’ she said. ‘I don’t want other parents to suffer like we 
have.

‘Bullies need to 
know the impact their actions can have. It has had catastrophic 
consequences for our family and we want them to see what they have done.
 Nothing can bring Dylan back – but we hope this sends a strong 
message.’

The 39-year-old owner of a hair salon said she realised her son was depressed but thought it was because she had had a stroke.

She
 added: ‘Before he started school, he was outgoing, he was always on his
 bike but afterwards that changed and he became more withdrawn. 

'Bullying
 did affect him, but he didn’t say anything. It is rife at that school 
and other parents have contacted me to say thanks for raising the issue.

‘He was a beautiful 
boy, he was so loving and we miss him every day. When we sit down at the
 table as a family, there’s always an empty chair.’

Dylan,
 who was born in Stoke-on-Trent, had started at Lakeside Academy in 
Telford, Shropshire, in January. Teachers told the inquest into his 
death – at Birmingham Children’s Hospital on April 30 – that there was 
no allegation that he was being bullied.

Bereft: Mrs Stewart, pictured her looking at Dylan's belongings, said today: 'He was a beautiful boy, he was so loving and we miss him every day. He lived for laughing. He was always laughing with me and the family'

The inquest heard Dylan was a model pupil at Lakeside Academy in Telford, which boasts a 'rigorous anti-bullying policy.'

Despite his family claiming  bullying was a contributing factor, teachers told the hearing there was no allegation he was being bullied.

The hearing also heard that on the day of Dylan’s hanging a £5 note went missing from Mr Stewart’s wallet, and the parents had discussed whether he had taken it. Dylan said he found it behind a radiator.

Defence: Dylan's school Lakeside Academy based in Stirchley, Shropshire, said they were 'confident that everything that could have been done by the school to support him was done'

Upset:
 Dylan's mother said his life was 'made hell' by bullies and police 
failed to take action after he was attacked in a bus stop outside 
school

Shropshire 
Coroner John Ellery last week recorded a narrative verdict that he 
hanged himself, but whether or not he intended to kill himself was 
unclear.

But
 Amanda and Robert - who are sure their son intended to take his own 
life - have now urged schools to take tougher action over bullying.

Robert,
 a chef, who is now a full-time carer for his wife, added: 'No child 
should be pushed to the point where they have to take their life because
 they feel that's the only way to escape.

'Schools
 also need to listen to pupils, there are a lot out there who are asking
 for help and they shouldn't be swept under the carpet.'

Lakeside Academy based in Stirchley, Shropshire, says it put in a number of measures to protect Dylan after he joined the school.

Barbara Williams, Lakeside Academy’s chair of governors, said: 'Lakeside has well established procedures for supporting young people at the school.

“We are very saddened by the tragic events surrounding Dylan Stewart. However I am confident that everything that could have been done by the school to support him was done.

'Lakeside Academy has an anti-bullying policy which includes generic sections for both staff and students.

'The section for students was put together by the students themselves.

'It is the nature of schools that bullying occurs from time to time but any incidents at Lakeside are dealt with very rapidly'.

In reference to the assault claims West Mercia Police said: 'From the description given it was a verbal attack rather than a physical one. His mother was happy that this was not a criminal matter and that the boys concerned with the incident were spoken to by police and advised regarding their conduct'.
