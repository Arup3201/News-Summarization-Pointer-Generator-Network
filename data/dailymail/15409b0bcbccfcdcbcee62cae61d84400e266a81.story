Guilty: Dr Barend Delport, a GP from Swanley in Kent, admitted sexual assault and creating indecent images

A married GP and Christian leader has admitted sexually assaulting child patients as young as 18 months and taking indecent photos of them during medical examinations.

Dr Barend Delport, 55, also pleaded guilty to having 500,000 indecent images of children on his computer, including some at category five, the most serious level.

Police said the South-African born doctor had committed ‘an appalling and gross breach of trust’ during his nine-year reign of abuse.

A court heard he indecently assaulted three girls, aged 14, four and 18 months, and three women, at his surgery in Swanley, Kent, between 2003 and 2012.

He was stopped only after a mother asked why her young daughter had been intimately examined and photographed by Delport when she had complained of a stomach ache.

Friends of the family GP and Baptist church elder expressed their shock that he had committed such ‘despicable crimes’ while hiding behind a facade of respectability.

Yesterday he pleaded guilty to 26 sexual offences at Maidstone Crown Court as members of his former church, Eynsford Baptist Church, and a neighbouring church packed the public gallery for the plea hearing.

Anthony Haycroft, prosecuting, said: ‘The defendant has pleaded guilty now to three offences of sexually assaulting children and three offences of sexually assaulting adults, as well as a plethora of offences for possessing, making and taking indecent images of children.

‘He had thousands of images downloaded from the internet of children and hundreds of images of child patients that he himself has taken. The crown regards these offences as of the utmost severity.’

Delport persuaded parents that he needed to conduct a genital examination of their children, before taking graphic images of the young patients.

Custody: The disgraced doctor is being held until his sentencing on September 9, where the judge has said he will be jailed

After police received a complaint in 
March, a letter was sent to every patient at The Oaks surgery urging 
them to get in touch if they had concerns. It provoked a string of 
similar allegations, spanning a decade.

Delport initially tried to claim that 
the images of patients were for ‘training purposes’ or because it was 
‘the worst he had ever seen’ of a particular illness.

Shortly after his arrest, Delport 
resigned from the surgery and fled the £500,000 three-bedroom home he 
shared with his wife Sally in the village of Eynsford. Friends said he 
had been warned by police to leave the area because he could be targeted
by the families of victims.

Breach of trust: Dr Delport took indecent images of patients at The Oaks surgery, in Swanley, Kent

Mrs Delport, 54, a jewellery maker, 
did not attend court yesterday. The couple, who have no children, are 
said to ‘remain committed’ to one another, although they live apart.

Members of Eynsford Baptist Church 
yesterday spoke of their ‘sense of betrayal’ by the man they had 
considered a spiritual leader. At the time of his arrest, he was 
presiding over every Sunday service following the departure of the 
minister.

He would hold so-called ‘soaking 
sessions’ in the waiting room of the surgery, when members of the 
community were invited to ‘immerse’ themselves in Christianity by 
listening to religious music and meditating.

Delport attended religious conferences
in Canada and even wrote a book published in 2008, called Interpreting 
Visions, Dreams And Symbols From A Biblical Perspective.

A source said: ‘People trusted him 
with their lives to guide them and give them advice when, all along, he 
was a paedophile. He believed God would talk to him directly about what 
was wrong with a patient. No one can believe what was actually going on.
It is shocking.’

Friends said Delport earned more than 
£100,000 a year and enjoyed spending his money on golfing holidays, 
clothes and technology.

The GP will remain in prison until 
sentencing next month. Judge Martin Joy told him there would be ‘an 
inevitable, lengthy custodial sentence’.

Delport has already been suspended by 
the General Medical Council and is expected to be struck off the medical
register following sentencing.
