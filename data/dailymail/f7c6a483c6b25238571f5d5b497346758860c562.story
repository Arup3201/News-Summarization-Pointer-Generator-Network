A man killed his wife and son just days after spending a family Christmas together, a court heard yesterday.

Garry and Janet Lockhart enjoyed a happy Christmas Day with two-year-old Michael and other relatives.

But on December 28, the couple had a drunken argument that ended in tragedy.

Yesterday at the High Court in Edinburgh, Mrs Lockhart’s father told how he phoned his daughter’s mobile phone from outside her locked-up home and could hear it ringing inside,

Shortly after, police forced their way into the house in the Midlothian town of Bonnyrigg and, after searching downstairs, found Michael and his mother upstairs dead on a bed.

Lockhart, 33, is accused of strangling Mrs Lockhart and smothering Michael.

He denies murder, but yesterday admitted killing them in a joint agreement between the Crown and his defence team.

The jury was told that Lockhart, described as a prisoner at Saughton in Edinburgh, said: ‘What I did was wrong.

‘I have no excuse for it. I just snapped after a drunken argument with Janet.’

The agreement continued: ‘I don’t  feel sorry for myself but I feel sorry for everyone in her family. I know I should be punished.’

Giving evidence yesterday, Lockhart’s father-in-law John Hood said that  the accused was his daughter’s first ‘serious boyfriend’ before they married in June 2010. The following year Michael was born.

Advocate Depute Iain McSporran, QC, asked how his 29-year-old daughter and Lockhart were getting on.

Mr Hood, 58, replied: ‘It seemed they were getting on very well. There didn’t seem any problems.’

The family had enjoyed Christmas Day together, but did not see each other on Boxing Day or the following day. The next day and still with no contact, Mr Hood went to his daughter’s house, but it was closed up.

As the day wore on, Mr Hood said he and his wife had become increasingly concerned and  contacted the police.

Later in the evening he accompanied police officers and went to the house.

Paul Simpson, who worked alongside Lockhart at a funeral parlour, told how Lockhart had phoned him early in the morning on December 28, but spoke to his partner. Returning the call, the 33-year old said ‘He (Lockhart) was quite hysterical and kept saying “I have lost my family and done something stupid”.’

‘I asked him about that and he said: “They are away. I have done something really bad”.’

Sgt Kevin Clark, 45, described how he had forced entry into the home.

As he approached the main bedroom he found a piece of paper at the door.

It read: ‘I am not a bad person. Shots of alcohol made me bad. I hope I rot in Hell.’

Shining his torch on the  bed, Sgt Clark said he saw two bodies. The boy was on his back with his arms at his side. The woman was face down with one arm over the boy. He added that they were both obviously dead.

Two other notes were found. The first read: ‘Police. I have killed my family.’ The second: ‘How could I kill Janet and Michael. They were my life. I loved Janet and Michael.’.

The trial, before Lady Wise, continues today.
