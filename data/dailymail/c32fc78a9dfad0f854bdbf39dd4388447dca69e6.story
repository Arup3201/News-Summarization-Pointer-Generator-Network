Arsenal forward Theo Walcott has revealed that Tomas Rosicky's no look pass before his stunning volley from the return ball against Brighton in the FA Cup was no new trick, as the Czech midfielder regularly produces similar pieces of skill in training.  

He told the Daily Star, 'Of course, that's what Tomas does in training all the time, looking the other way when he's passing the ball.

'It gets me every time! He's got that quality going forward. I love the way Tomas just turns and breaks with it. The goal was fantastic.'

For some, like Match of the Day pundit Mark Lawrenson, Rosicky's goal was the embodiment of spatial awareness and of the free-flowing football style that manager Arsene Wenger likes to ingrain into his sides.

For others, though, his moment of creativity has been dismissed as needless showboating. Former Manchester United defender Phil Neville said he would have 'smashed' anyone who tried a no look pass on him. 

Rosicky's goal helped Arseal to a 3-2 win over Brighton and earned them a spot in the FA Cup fifth-round where they will face Middlesbrough.

The Czech midfielder, 34, arrived at Arsenal in 2006 and has since made 235 appearances for The Gunners
