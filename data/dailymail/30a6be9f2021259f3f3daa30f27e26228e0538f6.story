She is the model of the moment after starring in one of the sexiest Super Bowl adverts last night - watched by the highest TV audience in history.

As Charlotte McKinney sashayed through the Carl's Jr. commercial, it was a million miles away from her high school days at Boone High School in Orlando, Florida.

There, she reveals to Daily Mail Online, she was bullied so badly she ended up leaving school at just 17.

The curvaceous blonde, now 21, admits: 'The girls were rude, they would call me w***e, slut, fake boobs, it was brutal, pretty brutal.'

Famous footsteps: Charlotte follows in the footsteps of supermodel Heidi Klum, Kate Upton, Kim Kardashian and even Paris Hilton

At parties Charlotte says: 'The girls would throw beer at me, just because I was the prettier girl in high school'

'But it was hard for me, when I was 14 I was growing into my body and I had these boobs, I didn't know what to do with them! But I just knew I was above it all, I have an older sister, Garland, who has my back and these girls didn't matter.'

Speaking about her decision to drop out of school, she says that she also suffered because she is dyslexic, admitting: 'I've had such a hard time with dyslexia my whole life. When I was a child I didn't learn to read until I was a lot older and I was behind in my classes, it was such a challenge.

'Whenever people talk about dyslexia, it's important to know that some of the smartest people in the world,  major owners of companies, are dyslexic. We just see things differently, so that's an advantage. I just learn a different way, there's nothing bad about it.'

Charlotte's parents Susan and Terry were always there for her, she says, and fully supported her when she left school.

'Most parents would be bummed out, but my parents knew I was on the right track, I knew what I had to do to be successful. 

'I'm only 5ft 7ins tall and for modelling that's small, so I wasn't getting signed, but I kept on pushing.' 

Charlotte won the Carl's Jr. role, following in the footsteps of Kate Upton, Nina Agdal, Kim Kardashian and and Heidi Klum, after they approached her management and has already snared a campaign for Guess, who discovered her on her social media accounts.

And now she's hoping her dream of appearing in Sports Illustrated's fabled swimsuit issue will come true.

She said: 'That's been my goal my whole life, to me, that's so iconic.'

Moving onwards and upwards, Charlotte has already filmed the sequel to Joe Dirt with David Spade, produced by Adam Sandler's production company Happy Madison.

Asked about constantly being compared to her fellow Carl's Jr. model Kate Upton, Charlotte says: 'I'm taking it on the chin, hopefully it will ease off soon, it's such a compliment to me, but just because we have boobs and we're blonde it doesn't mean we're the same!'

Advertisers are known to dish out an eye-popping $8M for just one minute of air time during the football game - which drew 111.5M viewers last year - while 30-second spots cost $4M. 

In the All-Natural Burger advert for Carl's Jr.  Charlotte seemingly struts 'au naturel' through a farmers market.

'[My dad] friggin' loved it,' Charlotte told People of the racy advert.

However, she told Daily Mail Online she DID eat her burger while filming, saying: 'I ate small bites, as it was a long shoot, but I definitely ate it!' 

As for her love life, Charlotte said she is 'having fun', but is NOT dating anyone seriously (yet).
