Scientists have managed to peer into the brains of mice so clearly that they watch as memories are formed. 

They saw how certain proteins changed and clustered on nerve cells, as memories were forged after tickling the creatures’ whiskers.

The technique could shed light on how we learn as well as what goes wrong in disorders like autism, Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia.

Scientists have managed to peer into the brains of mice so clearly that they can see how memories form. This is a single nerve cell in the cortex of a live mouse. Individual branches are shown in different colours and the bumps on the branches are where synapses form

‘As far as we know, no one has ever been able to look at receptor proteins in live animals before,’ said Professor Richard Huganir, director of the Department of Neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

‘This allows us to get a more accurate picture of what’s really happening as the brain processes experiences into memories.’ 

Researchers at the university in Baltimore, Maryland, studied AMPA receptors, which are proteins on the outside of nerve cells that receive signals in the form of the molecule glutamate.

Glutamate is the major mediator of  electrical signals in the central nervous systems of mammals and is involved in most aspects of normal brain function including cognition, memory and learning.

The receptors themselves play a role in strengthening synapses, which are the connections between nerve cells that form memories.

Up until now, scientists were limited to studying AMPA receptors in nerve cells in tissue samples, or grown in the laboratory, but neither of those methods could preserve the complex circuitry, hormones and neurochemicals of a living brain. 

Researchers studied AMPA receptors - proteins on the outside of nerve cells that receive signals and play a role in strengthening synapses, which firm memories.This image shows the formation of synapses on a nerve shaft in a mouse's brain after different periods of time, after its whiskers were stimulated 

To solve that problem, Professor Huganir’s team, led by Dr Yong Zhang, engineered mice whose AMPA receptors glowed under the light of a special microscope. 

The type of microscope they used is capable of focusing at a depth of half a millimetre, meaning it can peer into the brain’s outer layer - the cortex.

Thousands of nerve cells carry information to the cortex from every part of the body and each of a mouse’s whiskers has a group of dedicated nerve cells called barrel fields. 

The team took images of animals’ brains immediately before and after researchers tickled a single whisker on each mouse for an hour, according to the study, published in the journal Nature Neuroscience. 

They were surprised to find that tickling increased the number of AMPA receptors on nerve cells and strengthened the synapses of the barrel fields of the tickled whiskers, forming memories.

After monitoring the mice over a few days, they discovered that the AMPA receptor levels remained high, suggesting that the whisker-tickling experience had a long-term effect on the mice’s memories. 

Dr Zhang explained: ‘The mysteries are the purpose that is served by strengthening these synapses, and whether more AMPA receptors are being made or if they are moving in from somewhere else. 

‘Future studies will address those questions.’ 

Professor Huganir explained: ‘This technique opens up many more possibilities, like visualising learning at the molecular level as it is happening in the intact brain in healthy mice and in mouse models of brain disorders.’ 

The researchers plan on using the new technique to see what happens as mice learn a complex task. 

They hope to peer deeper into the brain to areas like the hippocampus, which has a crucial role in memory formation and has been implicated in neurological disorders like autism, Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia, once optics technology improves.
