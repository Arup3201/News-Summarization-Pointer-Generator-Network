Junior the puppy has found a novel way to tyre himself out before bedtime.

The blue and red-nose pitbull cross was playing with his brothers and siblings at home in Bakersfield, California, when he got his head irreversibly stuck inside the wheel-rim of his master's Buick Regal.

Owner Meagan Beeler tried everything she could to prise the playful pup free but he would not budge.

In the end she was forced to take him - and the wheel - to her local fire station where she begged firefighters for help.

Fortunately, firemen at station 41 in East Bakersfield has just the solution.

Using a combination of 'cooking oil and a little ingenuity' they were able to jimmy Junior to freedom to Meagan's delight.

But her relief was short lived after Meagan became the victim of internet trolls asking how she allowed the dog to get stuck in the wheel in the first place.

No lasting damage: Junior is one of a litter of five brothers and three sisters and was said to be doing well since his ordeal

In a post on her Facebook page, Meagan wrote: 'It is my puppy he was playing with 
his brothers and sisters on the patio where my husband had put his rims 
for his regal and he got it stuck I'm no low life or whatever else u 
want to call me.

'I am a highly educated woman thanks and I love my kids 
as well as my animals and would not let them get hurt purposely so go 
screw ur selves...'

She went on: 'As

brothers and 3 sisters ... but he is doing very well no bumps scraps of
