A British man accused of murdering his girlfriend on the holiday island of Crete was a loving and caring person who never appeared violent, a witness has told a court.

Luke Walker, 25, is accused of killing his girlfriend Chelsea Hyndman, 20, on the idyllic holiday island of Crete where the pair were working three years ago.

Greek prosecutors claim Ms Hyndman, who died after suffering severe injuries to her abdomen, was 
beaten by Walker, from Brierley Hill, West Midlands, in May 2010.

But Walker, who is charged with causing her death by actual bodily harm, has always maintained his innocence and claims she 
fell during a girls' night out in Malia and actually died 10 days later from 
septicaemia.

Louise Purdy, 27, told the court she regularly socialised with Walker, along with a group of others, and he did not appear to be a violent type of man.

'In our time I never saw a violent or aggressive person,' she said.

'Alcohol obviously does change you but I think with him, and the same with Chelsea, they became even more happy and life and soul of the party.

'They were very, very similar to each other and they did love to have fun and enjoy themselves.'

Miss Purdy met Miss Hyndman and Walker in 2009 when they were all working in the resort town of Malia, the couple were living and working as bar staff.

As she was getting to know Walker, an electrician, he was a 'very fun person, very loving, quite caring'.

Miss Purdy told the court she had been celebrating her birthday with Miss Hyndman and a group of friends on a girls’ night out on May 6, 2010.

They had been drinking in bars, had 
eaten a little bit during the night, and were all involved in playing a 
game where one of the group would shout a word and they all had to drop 
to the floor.

It was during this game that Miss Hyndman had an accident, she said.

'We left one particular bar and as we were walking up the road one of the girls shouted out the word,' Miss Purdy said.

'We all had to fall to the floor and the last person had to have a forfeit.

'As I got up Chelsea was running diagonally in front of me.

'All I remember is watching her 
feet... she had very high heels on and the floor was very cobble-y and 
as she was going across me her feet were very unsteady as if she was 
about to fall.

'The last thing I know Chelsea had hit the floor, she had gone down.'

The group helped Miss Hyndman to her 
feet and she told them she was okay, so they continued with their night 
and went to another bar.

Miss Purdy continued: 'As we got 
there I asked her ‘are you okay?’ and she said that she had hurt herself
 slightly on the stomach.'

After repeated delays, the trial was 
finally due to start today and lawyer Georgios Pyromallis said Walker 
was 'upbeat' and confident of clearing his name.

He
 said: 'I don't know how it will go, but I'm quite confident. We have a 
good case, and we have quite a strong defence argument.

'We
 will try to prove to the court that Luke never really touched Chelsea 
so it wasn't him who caused this injury to the pancreas.

'Luke is looking forward to it, believing that his name will be cleared, and he's really waiting for that.

'I can ascertain that he's feeling much better now because he was able to return to his country, to his family.

'Nevertheless
 he's fully aware of the importance of the trial, of the possible 
consequences of that verdict. If Luke is convicted he may face life 
imprisonment.

'But he's confident that he will have a good result, because he knows that he didn't do anything wrong.'

In the days following her accident 20-year-old Miss Hyndman seemed to become ill, Miss Purdy said.

They had a meal together with some other friends the next night and Miss Hyndman was unable to eat a great deal.

A few days after that Miss Purdy said she saw Miss Hyndman in a bar and her eyes looked 'discoloured', and the whites 'yellowy'.

Miss Purdy told the court she put her illness down to being the effects of drinking and not eating a lot, as was usual for their lifestyle at the time, or possibly sunstroke.

Miss Hyndman became even more unwell and around a week after their night out Miss Purdy went to visit her as she lay in bed.

'I gave her a cuddle and she said she was feeling a little better than she had done and I asked her what was wrong with this,' Miss Purdy said as she gestured with her hands towards her stomach area.

'She pulled her t-shirt up and her stomach was very taut, very bloated, she looked pregnant.'

Miss Purdy said she thought Miss Hyndman's condition was serious and she wanted to take her to hospital, but Miss Hyndman assured her she had managed to eat and drink a little and just needed some rest.

It was the last time Miss Purdy saw her alive, she told the court.

Walker maintains his innocence - claiming Miss Hyndman sustained her injuries after falling over on a night out

Walker, who appeared in court in black trousers and a white shirt and accompanied by members of his family, had kept her updated on Miss Hyndman's condition, she said.

If anything had been wrong between the couple she believed Miss Hyndman would have confided in her, she told the court.

'I don't think he would have ever done anything to hurt her.'

Miss Purdy went on: 'In the time I got to know her I do believe that she would have said something and not only would she have said it but we would have seen something that would have made us question things.'

Walker,
 from Brierley Hill, West Midlands, was jailed for five months following 
his arrest and then forced to remain in Greece on bail until October 
last year, when his trial was adjourned until today.

Ms Hyndman's family have travelled to the island to witness the trial.

Her
 mother Heather Hyndman, 47, of Castleford, West Yorks., said: 'I’m more
 prepared and more ready than last time. I’ve been through it all 
before, so I know what to expect.

'I just hope it will be over and done with before the courts close down over there for the summer.'

Greek
 courts close on July 1, and while the trial is due to last around four 
days, it can be interrupted if the judge has to deal with other cases.

Ms Hyndman said: 'Hopefully they will have a bit of compassion and appreciate how far we have all travelled, and hopefully I will get some answers.'

She and her partner Neil Lorriman will be represented in court by a Greek solicitor, and they are arranging to have a translator to help them follow proceedings.

The trial comes at the same time as the third anniversary of Chelsea’s death.

Her mother said: 'We set off a lantern for her and spent time with family. It’s hard most days, but it’s even harder this day.'

Mr Pyromallis claimed Chelsea's mother believes Walker killed Ms Hyndman and is pursuing the case.

Mr
 Pyromallis said: 'Chelsea's mother is chasing the case. She has 
appointed a lawyer here and she's preparing to defend her case.

'According
 to her position so far it was Luke who caused the injury to Chelsea and
 it was Luke who actually killed her.

'She has been supporting the 
argument that "I have nothing else to do than believing what the Greek 
doctors said", but from the fact she has appointed a lawyer here in 
Greece, who will represent her, I believe that she's willing to fight 
for Luke's conviction.

'According
 to the findings of the Greek authorities Luke was the one who punched 
or kicked Chelsea in the belly area, and that this caused the pancreas 
injury which in the end led to Chelsea's death.

'The
 Greek coroner [Elpida Spanoudaki] said that this pancreatic injury was 
caused by an external power, which is either a punch or a kick.

'The
 medical findings could lead to the direction that Chelsea was injured 
ten days before her death after a fall she had in a party she had with 
her friends, or to an alleged kick or punch on her abdomen area.

'The most important thing will be what Chelsea's friends are about to testify.

'I
 know from their statements which they gave in Greece and the UK that 
all of them really can't believe that Luke ever really raised a hand 
against Chelsea.

'They all testify that if something like that happened, for sure Chelsea would have told them about it.'

Walker maintains he himself took Chelsea to get treatment several days after she said she was feeling unwell.

On
 his return to the UK, he said: 'I've never had closure from losing her.
 The last time I saw her was when she was taken to the operating room. 
She said she loved me and I said I loved her.'
