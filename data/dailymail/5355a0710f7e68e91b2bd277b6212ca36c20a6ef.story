Legendary Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino wants to withdraw from a concussion lawsuit filed against the NFL in federal court last week, claiming he had joined the litigation in error.

The Hall of Famer and his lawyers are looking into how his name was joined to the lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Philadelphia.

‘It was never Marino’s intention to initiate litigation in this case, but to ensure that in the event he had adverse health consequences down the road, he would be covered with health benefits. They are working to correct the error,’ a source told the South Florida Sun Sentinel.

Legendary Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino wants to withdraw from a concussion lawsuit filed against the NFL in federal court last week, claiming he had joined the litigation in error

Marino has said he sustained two concussions during his 17-year playing career, which ended in 1999. He worked as an NFL analyst for CBS until last year.

The Los Angeles Times reported on Monday that the former quarterback had joined 14 other players to sue the league.

They joined more than 4,800 others who have alleged the NFL misrepresented the long-term dangers of concussions. The NFL has denied those claims.

An original settlement worth $765 million, reached last August, was rejected by a federal judge in January as being insufficient.

Miami Herald columnist Armando Salguero has speculated that Marino didn't expect the 'backlash' over the NFL suit

The lawsuit doesn't specify which medical problems are suffered by the retired players.

But it says they have included headaches, dizziness, loss of memory, dementia, depression, impulse control, impulsivity to anger, physical disability, embarrassment, and a 'loss of the pleasures of life'.

And it is similar in wording to several previous lawsuits, accusing the NFL of 'carelessness, negligence, intentional misconduct and concealment of information' directly connected with the players' injuries.

The 18-page document, seen by MailOnline, says the plaintiffs are seeking damages to be decided by a jury for long-term or chronic injuries, along with funds for medical treatment.

'Despite knowledge of such dangerous practices and the increased risk of head injury to the players, the NFL turned a blind eye for decades'

Complaint filed with district court in Philadelphia

'For over 40 years [the NFL] have continuously and fervently denied that it knew, should have known or believed there to be any relationship between NFL players suffering concussions while playing, the NFL policies concerning tackling methodology,' the complaint says.

It adds that evidence showing concussion causes the brain condition amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has been readily available 'for more than 100 years'.

The complaint notes that the most dangerous tackles - where players used their heads as a 'weapon' - were outlawed in the late 1970s.

But it adds that the laws were not well-enforced, saying: 'The NFL wanted to keep its fan base excited by the visual exhilaration witnessing such hazardous techniques.

'Despite the NFL’s knowledge of such dangerous practices and the increased risk of head injury to the players, the NFL turned a blind eye for decades.'

Later loopholes, it alleged, 'demonstrated Defendant’s selfish desire to keep the fan base entertained and interested in the violence of the sport of football.'

Commentators say claims by such a titan of the NFL will add credibility to one side of a long-running dispute which escalated into a series of House of Representatives hearings four years ago.

Some 4,500 former football players 
filed a class-action lawsuit against the NFL, claiming the League had 
not warned them enough about the dangers of concussion.

The NFL agreed on a $765 million settlement with that group of players last August, but it was
 rejected by a federal judge in January.

The news has come days after President Obama said more research should be carried out on the effects of concussion on young athletes.

He hosted a White House summit last week at which he was 
introduced by Victoria Bellucci, a high school graduate from 
Huntingtown, Maryland, who suffered five concussions during her high 
school and club soccer career and said they 'drastically altered' her life.

The President said a new attitude is needed where players who have been hit don't feel wimpy for sitting out a game or two.

'We have to change a culture that says you suck it up,' Obama said, adding that he probably suffered mild concussions as a young football player.

He added: 'We want our kids participating in sports. As parents, though, we want to keep them safe.'

Marino is by far the longest-serving of 
the 15 latest players to sue the NFL. The list also includes Dwight 
Wheeler, 59, a center for the Los Angeles Raiders and New England 
Patriots who played for nine seasons.

Elsewhere
 on the list is defensive tackle Bruce Clark, now 56, who played for 
eight seasons, all but one of them for the New Orleans Saints.

Former Chicago Bears player Peter Manning, who is the oldest plaintiff at age 76, is also seeking compensation for his wife.

In his prime: Marino playing the San Francisco 49ers in the 1980s. He remained with the Dolphins for 17 years

Marino was a quarterback at the University of Pittsburgh when he was picked to join the Miami Dolphins in 1983.

He remained with the team for 17 
seasons - the whole of his NFL career - and won several honours and 
records, amassing an eye-popping 4,967 of 8,358 passes for 61,361 yards,
 242 games and 420 touchdowns.

Just
 a year after he joined the team, Marino played with the Dolphins in the
 1984 season Super Bowl against the San Francisco 49ers.

Though
 the Dolphins were thrashed 38-16, the match was hyped as a battle of 
the quarterbacks between 23-year-old Marino and the 49ers' more 
experienced Joe Montana.

His passing skills were the stuff of legend, and in 13 games he threw for more than 400 yards.

He was inaugurated into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2005, dedicating his speech to his father.

Mystery: The court filings do not specify what injuries the legendary quarterback suffered

That was only after he had passed into legend in popular culture.

He
 played himself in the 1994 box office hit Ace Ventura: Pet Detective 
and guest starred in an episode of the Simpsons in which Homer and Bart 
visit the Super Bowl.

The star has had no major documented concussions, but tore an Achilles' tendon in 1993 and suffered a neck injury late in his career.

After retirement he worked as a CBS analyst for more than a decade before leaving the network a few months ago.
