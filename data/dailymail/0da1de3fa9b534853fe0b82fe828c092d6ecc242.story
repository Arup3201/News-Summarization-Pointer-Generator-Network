The White House may ban all presidential selfies, bringing to an end a series of selfies taken by illustrious personalities, ranging from prime ministers to science guys, with President Obama.

The possibility was raised by White House senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer on CBS's Face the Nation on Sunday morning.

Pfeiffer said that following the controversy after a Red Sox player took a photo with Obama on Wednesday and was later revealed to have a deal with Samsung, the White House had 'had talks' with the Korean company.

Say cheese: Obama allows David Ortiz to take a selfie with him, unaware the latter is contracted to Samsung

Going viral: If Samsung did instruct Ortiz to take a selfie with Obama, it's certainly garnered a lot of attention - although not necessarily the right kind

He emphasized that Obama didn't know that the selfie was part of a Samsung promotion.

'Well, (Obama) obviously didn't know anything about Samsung's connection to this,' he said, adding 'perhaps maybe this will be the end of all selfies.'

President Obama unwittingly became part of Samsung's marketing campaign when the Red Sox visited the White House last week.

Hitter David Ortiz snapped an apparently impromptu selfie with the president, but it later turned out he had inked a deal with Samsung to be the company's 'social media insider.'

The role requires him to promote the company's smartphones and contribute to viral marketing campaigns.

Ortiz tweeted the image, garnering more than 38,000 retweets - including one by Samsung, which has more than 5.2 million followers.

Ortiz denies he was instructed to take the Obama selfie by Samsung, but the idea of the president's likeness being used to market electronics caused uproar.

Pfeiffer said that the White House has 'had conversations with Samsung about this and expressed our concerns' but did not elaborate, saying only, 'We've left that conversation to our lawyers.'

It's not the first time Obama's selfie-readiness has caused controversy.

In December, he was criticized for posing for a selfie with Denmark Prime Minister Helle Thorning and British Prime Minister David Cameron at Nelson Mandela's memorial service.Â
