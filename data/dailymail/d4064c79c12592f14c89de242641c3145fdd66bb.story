They are famously the world's largest land animal, but this particular elephant looks far more at home in the water.

The playful baby elephant made a real splash as it frolicked in the ocean on the Thai island of Phuket.

Video footage shows the cute creature trotting into the water and ducking its head beneath the waves, before emerging onto the sand only to rush straight back into the surf.

The splash-happy elephant calf spent several minutes enjoying the refreshing waters of the Andaman Sea, to the delight of tourists capturing the endearing scene on camera.
