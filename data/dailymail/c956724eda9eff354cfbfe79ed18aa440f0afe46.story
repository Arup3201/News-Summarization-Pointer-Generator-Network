Postboxes in rural areas are to be saved by rules which say that almost everyone must have one within half a mile of their home.

Royal Mail had wanted to lift protection for the country’s 115,000 postboxes, putting those in remote areas at risk of being removed to save money.

But in a victory for rural communities, regulator Ofcom has insisted that the iconic red postboxes must be protected.

Saved: Regulator Ofcom has insisted that the iconic red postboxes must be protected

Under its proposals, published yesterday, 98 per cent of Britons must have a postbox which is ‘within half a mile’ of their home.

The distance is measured by a ‘straight line’ rather than along a winding road.

It provides more protection for postboxes in obscure locations, such as nestled in the walls of cottages or hidden in bushes on country lanes by the sea.

Yesterday the Department for Business said the new rules, which will be subject to a consultation ending on May 1, ‘can only be a good thing’.

Under the current rules people must have a postbox ‘within 500 metres’ of their home.

But the rules only cover areas where there are at least 200 delivery points – typically, a letter box – per square kilometre, which means people living in rural areas are left out.

But while Ofcom agreed with Royal Mail that the current rules are ‘not fit for purpose’, it said they did not go far enough.

An Ofcom report said: ‘They [the current rules] do not protect those users who are most likely to need protection – users in rural areas, where postboxes typically have lower volumes of mail and higher costs of collection per item.’

Around 2 per cent of addresses would not be covered by the new rules.

Typically these are in ‘very remote or isolated locations such as farmhouses’, Ofcom said. Royal Mail must provide ‘sufficient’ postboxes or alternatives.

Claire Norman, from the Campaign to Protect Rural England said: ‘Quite apart from the iconic value of our much-loved red postboxes, they provide a vital and necessary service on which many still depend.’

Ofcom also ruled out getting rid of the first class next-day delivery service.

It scrapped an idea, which it had raised last year, of merging first and second class post into one service taking two days to arrive.
