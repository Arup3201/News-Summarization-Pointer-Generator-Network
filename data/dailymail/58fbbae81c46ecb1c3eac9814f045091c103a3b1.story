An angler wrestled a giant catfish likened to a 'serpent' from the depths of a lake landing the catch, which at 119 pounds and 6ft long is Britain's biggest freshwater fish.

Alex Fanshawe, 32, fought the fish for 15 minutes before hauling his prize ashore - a Wels catfish he nicknamed Duke - with the help of fellow fishermen on the third attempt.

The monster catfish is longer nose-to-tail than its captor Mr Fanshawe is tall and was snared during his first trip to Oakwood Park Predator Lakes in Norfolk.

Mr Fanshawe, from Ruislip in west London, had just joined the Catfish Conservation Group of freshwater fishermen, when he landed the group's top prize.

Angler Alex Fanshawe, 32, battled for 15 minutes wrestling a giant catfish - 'The Duke' - at the same lake in Thetford, Norfolk. The Duke was thought to be the biggest fish in the lake until Will's catch

He said he was woken by an alarm attached to his reel, alerting him to a fish picking up the bait.

He said: 'It was the last morning of the trip when I was awoken from my slumber at 5am by the sound of my alarms and a screaming reel telling me that something big had picked up my bait and was moving off at quite some pace in the opposite direction.

'A few minutes into the fight and this fish wasn’t budging and it started to dawn on me that this could be a real monster.

'With the help of some fellow anglers, who had heard the commotion and gathered behind me, we were all able to lift the fish onto the waiting mat on the third attempt.

'I’ve only been catfishing for about a
 year, and so far that trip I’d only managed to land a small carp so the
 lads were laughing at me.

'A few minutes into the fight and this fish wasn't budging and it started to dawn on me that this could be a real monster'

'They
 weren’t laughing after I caught the Duke though. Before the Duke, the 
biggest fish I’ve ever caught was probably only a 5lb catfish.

'I couldn’t believe it. It was like a serpent, when we were pulling it in, it just kept coming out of the water like a serpent.'

The carnivorous fish, known as Duke, is well over 30-years-old, and is the second biggest freshwater fish ever caught.

Mr Fanshawe, who works as a DJ, added: 'I stood there in total shock and disbelief.

'To say I was over the moon was an understatement. It was the largest fish I have ever seen on the bank and the most amazing experience of my life.

The giant fish, which measures around 6ft from nose to tail, is thought to be the biggest living freshwater fish in Britain

Wels catfish, also known as sheatfish, are found in areas of central, southern and eastern Europe, as well as near the Baltic and Caspian Seas.

They are a scaleless fresh and brackish water fish, recognisable by a broad, flat head and wide mouth.

They can live for around 30 years and have excellent hearing.

Wels catfish feed on insects, crustaceans and other fish, as well as frogs, mice, rats and water birds including ducks.

There have been instances where the breed has been spotted lunging from the water to catch pigeons on the shore.

They live in large, warm lakes and deep slow-flowing rivers.

In rare cases the species can grow up to 13ft and reach more than 400lbs making it the second largest freshwater breed of fish after the beluga sturgeon.

'I’m definitely going to try to catch a 
bigger fish, but it may be a problem since I’ve landed the biggest 
coarse fish in Britain.'

Adrian Hills, from the Catfish Conservation Group, said: 'I think it’s safe to say that Duke is probably Britain’s largest living freshwater fish. Well done, Alex.'

Fishing experts The Angling Trust said they too are not aware of a bigger freshwater fish in Britain.

A
 spokesman said: 'I’m not aware of a bigger freshwater fish.

'It must 
have been difficult to land something that is bigger than a person.

'Fifteen minutes is quite a long time in those circumstances. Many bigger fish are landed in much less time.'

In 2012, chef James Jones landed a 144lb Wels catfish at a lake in Essex. However, that monster fish has since died.

The monster male catfish measured approximately 8ft from nose to tail - and was caught using a bit of mackerel.
