Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia have arrived in Italy for an official visit to mark the fifth month of their reign.

Letizia looked elegant in a cream jacket with stitch detail, coupled with a below knee pencil skirt and towering heels as they began the visit with a meeting at the Quirinal Palace with Italian President Giorgio Napolitano, 89, and his wife, Clio Bittoni.

Former reporter Queen Letizia smiled for the waiting cameras as she and King Felipe were met by Spanish Minister of Agriculture, Food and Environment Isabel Garcia Tejerina.

During the visit the royal couple will also meet with Prime Minister Matteo Renzi and the chairmen of the Senate and the chamber of deputies.

While Felipe VI wass scheduled to return to Madrid late last night, while Queen Letizia will stay on in Rome to address an international conference of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation.

The Spanish Royal visit comes five months to the day after King Felipe was coronated on June 19 in a ceremony at the Spanish Congress, following the abdication of his father, Juan Carlos I.

Since he became King, the royal couple has visited eight countries, and it is their second visit to Italy, the first being in June when they traveled to Rome to meet with Pope Francis at the Vatican

Letizia, whose father Jesús José Ortiz Álvarez and stepmother Ana Togores are both journalists, enjoyed a lengthy career in TV and newspapers before marrying Felipe in 2004

After a stint at Asturian daily paper, La Nueva España, she went on to work for ABC, a popular national newspaper that enjoys the third largest circulation in Spain.

Next came a stint at Spanish news agency EFE before a move to Guadalajara in Mexico saw her take on a role on local paper, Siglo 21. 

Back in Spain a year later, she worked for the Spanish version of Bloomberg, a news channel and agency specialising in economics, before moving to CNN+.

By the time she met her husband-to-be, Letizia was working for popular TV channel 24 Horas, where along with anchoring the popular Telediario 2 evening news bulletin, she reported on a wide range of breaking news events, among them the 2000 US presidential elections and the 9/11 attacks.

Perhaps as a result of her reporting background, Letizia is one of the most enthusiastically pro-newspaper royals in Europe and regularly turns out for journalist charities and awards ceremonies.
