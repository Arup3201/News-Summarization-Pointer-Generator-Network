Rielle Hunter has today offered an astonishing apology for her sordid affair with John Edwards, admitting for the first time that her behavior was 'wrong and selfish'.

In an open letter, the former videographer, laments: 'I behaved badly'. In fact, she feels so terribly in the wrong, Hunter writes, that today an updated version of her 2012 memoir is published 'annotating all of my regrets and mistakes'.

The former mistress writes that she hurt many people, beginning with Edwards' late wife Elizabeth. Mrs Edwards - who Hunter called a 'witch on wheels' - was dying from breast cancer when Hunter embarked on a relationship with her husband.

Mistress: Rielle Hunter published an apology letter today following her affair with John Edwards. She said sorry to his late wife Elizabeth, who was dying of cancer while they carried out the affair, and his children

Hunter, who has a five-year-old daughter Quinn from her affair with Edwards, also said sorry to John and Elizabeth's children and the voters who once supported Edwards as North Carolina senator and in his bid for the White House.

In a hand-wringing, confessional piece in the Huffington Post, Hunter writes: 'Unfortunately, I was not thinking about anyone but myself.

'I was selfish. I fell in love with John Edwards and wanted to be with him and that desire trumped everything else.'

Hunter explains that she regrets having written a book about her scandalous affair with Edwards in 2004. 

Hunter says that she feels 'horrible'
about the mistakes that she made in her book so has now published an 
'annotated' version, marking out exactly where she went wrong.

The 'explosive tell-all' was published last July but sold just 6,000 copies despite a media blitz.

However
this new version of the book comes in the spirit of setting the record 
straight, according to Hunter's apologetic remarks.

Today, she offered an apology for her affair with married father Edwards... and said she published a new version of the book, highlighting where she was wrong (right)

She adds: 'Owning your past mistakes is no day at the beach but I do believe it is an important endeavor to undertake.'

Hunter closes the letter by sharing with readers that both her parents cheated on each other and she does not want to pass the damaging traits she had learned on to her own daughter.

Much of Hunter's book 'What Really Happened: John Edwards, Our Daughter, and Me' describes their unfolding relationship and the lengths to which Hunter went to sneak in and out of Edwards' hotel rooms, even after her contract as a videographer ended. She also describes paparazzi chases after news of their affair broke.

Hunter's remarkable apology comes one day after Cate Edwards, Edwards' eldest daughter, admitted that it would have been far 
easier to stay angry at her father after he had an affair while her 
mother was dying of cancer.

However
she said that with 'commitment and persistence' she now has a good 
relationship with him and had even met 
Quinn.

Cate told Katie Couric on Monday that her father gave her the news of his  devastating affair in person.

She said: 'My
dad told me, he really felt like he needed to be upfront with me. I was 
an adult so he felt like he could have that conversation. It was very 
difficult.'

Couric, who had
interviewed John and Elizabeth Edwards on the campaign trail, asked 
Cate Edwards if she was 'enraged' by her father's actions.

Ms Edwards said: 'There's
anger but there's still so much
love there. We both worked together to work through it and get our 
relationship to the point that it is today, which is that we have a great
relationship.'

She added: 'It was hard, it took a lot of commitment but I wouldn't have had it any other way.

'We've been through so much together, our family has been through a lot and he was there, we were both there through all of that.

'It's not simple... I think it would be easier to have stayed angry. Forgiveness is tough and it takes commitment and persistence... and a lot of love.'

The 31-year-old also revealed that she had met her father's youngest daughter from that affair with Hunter, five-year-old Quinn.

Family: Cate (center) was very close to her mother Elizabeth (seen here in 2008), who died of cancer in 2010. She works to raise awareness of advanced stage breast cancer. The picture shows the family on the campaign trail with her father John and younger siblings Emma Claire and Jack

She told Katie
that the little girl was 'cute and adorable' but they didn't see each 
other much as Ms Edwards lives in DC and Quinn with her mother in North 
Carolina.

She added that Quinn had a great relationship with her father.

Following the testing
time of a public sex scandal, Ms Edwards was by her father's side in 
2011 when he was indicted on six felony counts for allegedly misusing 
campaign funds in an effort to hide his relationship with Hunter.

A federal jury eventually found Edwards not guilty on one count and deadlocked on the others.

Ms Edwards said that following all the trials that life had thrown at her, she was shown 'just how much strength you can garner'.
