Boris Johnson today urged Conservative activists to ignore the doubters and take the fight to UKIP and Labour with eight months until the election.

In a barn-storming, joke-laden speech, the London Mayor wielded a brick to promote housebuilding, mocked David Cameron's embarrassment for claiming the Queen 'purred' and ridiculed Ed Miliband's 'conveyor belt tongue'.

But he saved his most bombastic and outspoken attack for UKIP, vowing to 'eat the kippers for breakfast', just hours after his former deputy mayor Richard Barnes announced he was defecting to Nigel Farage's party.

The Tory party conference in Birmingham has been dominated by talk of defections to UKIP, following the moves by Tory MPs Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless.

But Mr Johnson vowed to 'eat the 'Kippers for breakfast' as he sought to unite Tories behind the battle with Labour.

In a move timed to embarrass the London Mayor, ex-right-hand man Richard Barnes announced that he was joining Ukip just hours before Mr Johnson's speech to the party conference in Birmingham.

Mr Barnes, who served as deputy mayor between 2008 and 2012, accused mainstream parties of failing to 'speak the language of normal people'.

But Mr Johnson hit back at 'quitters and splitters' and told activists that victory in next year's general election was 'within our grasp' as long as the party remained united.

ON ED MILIBAND FORGETTING TO MENTION THE DEFICIT

‘The baggage handlers of his memory refused to load the word deficit on to the conveyor belt of his tongue.’

ON BUS CRIME

‘Bus crime is down by 40 per cent. Which is absolutely not crime committed by buses, which is very rare indeed now. Not crime committed on buses.’

ON CAMERON CLAIMINGTHE QUEEN PURRED OVER SCOTLAND'S NO VOTE

‘London is not just the capital of England, but thanks to the wisdom of a majority of Scots, it is the capital of Britain and the capital of the United Kingdom… You have permission to purr if you so choose.’

ON NEW HOMES

‘I want those homes to be marketed first and sold to people from this country and not sold to oligarchs from the planet Zog. I am not Zoggist. Most of my ancestors come from Zog.’

Opening his speech, he asked the packed audience in the Symphony Hall of the ICC: 'Whoa there. Just before I begin can I check that we are all proud Conservatives? 

'Proud of the oldest and most successful party in all the Western democracies? Do we intend to fight the next election under the Conservative banner and no others?

'Are there any quitters or splitters? Anyone feeling a bit yellow around the edges - like a kipper?

'If I can quote a great Midlands author,' he said in a direct message to other waverers culled from Shakespeare's Henry V: 'He which hath no stomach to this fight, let him depart.

'Because I genuinely think that this is a fantastic time to be a Conservative and that just in the last few months we have seen the beginning of the end of the tapioca-like consensus that Ed Miliband could somehow osmotically infiltrate or inveigle himself into power by pandering to his core vote and relying on the gross unfairness of the electoral system.

'The light is dawning, scales falling. Across the country the chattering classes are waking up to the reality that victory is within our grasp in the next eight months.'

Only the Tories could deliver reform to the UK's relationship with the European Union and an in/out referendum on membership, he said. And he mocked Ed Miliband for failing to mention the deficit in his Labour conference speech.

‘My friends, it can only be called a Freudian slip. His subconscious rebelled,' said Johnson.

‘The baggage handlers in his memory went on strike – as they would under a Labour government – and refused to load the word deficit on to the conveyor belt of his tongue.

‘Because on this central question of politics he knows that it is we Conservatives who are taking this country forward.

‘And Labour would take us back to the Brown-Miliband-Balls regime that gave us the worst recession for 100 years.’=

Comparing the successful fight against Scottish independence with the imminent by-election battles to retain the seats given up by defecting MPs Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless, he said: 'That's our new fisheries policy, folks.

'First chuck Salmond overboard and then eat the 'Kippers for breakfast.

'We will fight them on the beaches of Clacton and of Rochester and Strood as well.' 

He went on: 'There’s only leader in Europe which can deliver reform. One man who has the experience and respect in Europe to make the case and then take that case to the people of the country in an in-out referendum. 

'That man is not Salmond or Clegg or Miliband. That man is David Cameron.’ 

Mr Johnson urged Tories to ignore the doubters and make the case for a majority government in 2015

Samantha Cameron arrived in Birmingham tonight, ahead of husband David's speech to the Tory conference

He issued a direct plea to Conservatives to be more outspoken in their defence of the party's work and achievements.

'For 200 years our party has been a party which believes in social justice. We believe that the best answer to inequality is opportunity.

‘We believe in encouraging success not punishing. We believe in wealth creation not levelling down.

'That’s why all our polices are aimed at getting people into work.'

He went on: 'Let us unite now, let’s get together. Get the whole Conservative family together. Take the fight to the unrepentant, unreconstructed semi-Marxist Eds Miliband and Balls. Lets be proud of our part and what we have done.

‘And when people doubt us and doubt our good intentions, explain again and again our fundamental Conservative instincts that we live by.

‘Let’s leave Ed Balls to his football practice, let’s leave Ed Miliband to mast the art of the bacon sandwich.

‘Let’s leave the Clegger, Nick Clegg, to get on with whatever it is that he does.

‘Let us, let us the Conservative, get on with our work of the harnessing talents of the people of this country. See you at the barricades!’ 

His jokey speech was well-received by Tories in the conference hall, including David Cameron.

But it stood in stark contrast to the heavyweight speech delivered immediately beforehand by Home Secretary Theresa May, who is widely seen as a future rival for the party leadership.

Matthew Engel, veteran political commentator at the Financial Times, said the contrast was ‘like bringing on Tommy Cooper after the prophet Elijah’.

The brick Mr Johnson had with him came from  Ibstock Brick Ltd in Newcastle-under-Lyme which he visited yesterday.

He said the company was ‘hiring people and firing bricks’ to help ‘build the homes that people need, and to help them on to the property ladder’.

With 400,000 new homes needed in London, huge resources and building materials will be required, he said.  

‘We will need 1billion... This brick will not be alone when it comes to London.‘I want those homes to be marketed first and sold to people from this country and not sold to oligarchs from the planet Zog. I am not Zoggist. Most of my ancestors come from Zog.’
