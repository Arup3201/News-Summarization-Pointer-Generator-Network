A 21-year-old man has surrendered himself to police in relation to the murder of a classmate two years ago.

Thomas Liming, from Islip, New York, has been charged with second-degree murder over the death of Kyle Underhill, 18, whose battered body was found in a marsh on November 16, 2011, in the woods behind Commack Road Elementary School.

Assistant District Attorney Janet Albertson said Underhill suffered more than a dozen blunt-force wounds to his head and face, as well as multiple fractured ribs, according to Newsday.

There was also evidence of 'neck compression', causing a fractured bone in the back of his neck, she said.

Albertson said the medical examiner's office determined that Underhill was still alive when he was submerged in the marsh.

Thomas Liming, 21, was charged with second-degree murder and held on a $15 million bond following he death of his classmate and friend, Kyle Underhill, in November 2011

The body of 18-year-old Kyle Underhill was found in a marsh in the woods of Islip, not far from his home. There were multiple injuries and two sticks lodged in his mouth and throat

The body was found covered with a wood board.

There were two sticks were lodged in his mouth and throat, the prosecutor said.

Liming and Underhill knew each other from Islip High School, graduating together in May 2011.

As it stands there is no motive.

Liming's attorney, Joseph Corozzo, said his client is innocent.

'Thomas Liming did not commit a crime . . . and when the jury hears all the evidence, Mr. Liming will be found not guilty,' he said.

'There's a lot to this case.'

Liming has been the target of a homicide investigation for two years.

Kyle Underhills body was found in these woods in Islip, New York, at 9am on November 16, 2011, the day after his parents reported him missing

When his parents were recently subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury, Liming realized he was going to be indicted and subsequently turned himself in to Suffolk County authorities.

Underhill caused a stir with what he wrote in the Islip High School yearbook.

Under his photo was this quote: 'I don’t think I’ve ever known so many people I hated so much all at once. See you in Abbadon.'

Abbadon commonly refers to the depths of hell.

Brian Melton, a student at the community college, said he can't believe Liming would have any involvement in Underhill's death.

'They were the best of friends,' said Melton, 20.

'They were like brothers. Kyle and Tom got along famously.'

Kyle Underhill caused a stir with the message he left in his yearbook, denouncing the people at his high school

'Tom killing Kyle? That's impossible in my head.'

Melton learned of Underhill's disappearance as he was traveling back from a friend's house.

Shocked, he sent his friend a pleading Facebook message, saying, 'Kyle, don't let it be you in those woods'.

Liming's bond has been set at $15 million.

He is due back in court on Jan. 3.
