A national champion athlete, who became obese after a knee injury ended her career, has managed to lose almost half her body weight with the help of the TV series Extreme Weight Loss.

Cassandra Dumas, 45, from California, explained during last night's episode that a divorce also added to her problems and decades of comfort eating saw her tip the scales at 364pounds.

'No one would ever guess that this body is a national champion. I let my body get this way, I got out of control,' the former discus and shot put star said, adding that she'd also turned into a recluse.

'I don’t venture out like I used to. I come home and I cook dinner. Generally I don't eat at the dining room table, I usually fix my plate and I come to my bedroom. I didn’t think I’d be in this situation.'

In a bid to get into shape she sent a letter to Chris Powell, Extreme Weight Loss' fitness trainer, asking for his help.

After being accepted on to the show, she was given one year to turn her life around and ditch her unhealthy habits.

Mr Powell encouraged her to take up exercise again, instead of sitting fixed to the TV and computer screen.

'I've always felt I could do anything I put my mind to, but I've always put others first. This year, I'm putting myself first'

He also sent her to a nutritionist to get advice on meal plans.

Apparently condiments were one of her guilty pleasures, and she would put spoonfuls of mayonnaise or ketchup on her dinners adding up to 400 calories each time.

Giving her greater impetus to slim down a full medical examination revealed that she suffered from  sleep apnea.

The disorder, characterized by pauses in breathing during sleep, can cause fatigue and increase the risk of high blood pressure, heart attack, stroke, obesity, and diabetes.

'I don't venture out like I used to. I come home and I cook dinner. I didn't think I'd be in this situation'

'I let my body get this way . . .  and I’m going to fix this,' Ms Dumas said determinedly.

Asked where she would like to be in one year, she told Mr Powell: 'I want to lose weight and I want to eventually meet the person I’ll spend a lifetime with.'

She said that she never wanted to be a divorcee and looked to her parents' 50-year-marriage as inspiration. However, her past relationship was plagued by trust issues.

As the year went on the former athlete, who now works as a  high school guidance counselor, found that her confidence started to return.

Instead of hiding away she tried speed dating and even went on a singles adventure trip.

'I’ve always felt I could do anything I put my mind to, but I’ve always put others first. This year, I’m putting myself first,' she said.

While she experienced a few setbacks along the way, forcing Mr Powell to give her smaller weekly weight loss goals, Ms Dumas continued to push through.

At her final weigh-in she stepped on to the scales in front of friends, family and her high school students. All sounded their amazement at her transformation.

Ms Dumas' weight came in at 189 pounds. She is now set for surgery to take away five square feet of excess skin and 15 extra pounds of tissue from her body.

She concluded: 'It was a year that made me refocus myself, to make my dreams come true, to realize that I’m unstoppable . . . I know I’ll never go back.'
