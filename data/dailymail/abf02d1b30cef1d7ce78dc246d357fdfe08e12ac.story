It has emerged that Lord Mayor of London Fiona Woolf, who has been appointed to investigate claims of an Establishment cover-up of sexual abuse, as close ties to former Home Secretary Lord Brittan

MPs last night demanded answers from the new chairman of the historic child sex abuse inquiry about her links to Leon Brittan.

On Friday, Lord Mayor of London Fiona Woolf was appointed to investigate claims of an Establishment cover-up of sexual abuse.

But last night it emerged she has close ties to former Home Secretary Lord Brittan, who is likely to be called to give evidence about claims he oversaw the cover-up.

The revelations sparked fury among MPs who campaigned for the inquiry, which has already seen one chairman, Baroness Butler-Sloss, step down.

Labour MP Simon Danczuk said he was ‘dismayed’ by the revelations. He called on Mrs Woolf to ‘come out and explain her relationship with Leon Brittan’.

He said he was ‘gobsmacked at how wrong the Home Office can get it’, adding: ‘For the chair of the inquiry to be a family friend of the Brittans is just not acceptable.’

Yesterday the Mail on Sunday revealed Mrs Woolf judges a City award scheme alongside Lord Brittan’s wife, Diana. She also gave her a £50 donation for a charity fun run last year. And it emerged she has lived on the same central London street as the Brittans for nearly a decade.

A further link between the two emerged last night as it became apparent Mrs Woolf and Lord Brittan both sit on the advisory board of a lobbying group, TheCityUK, which was set up to campaign for the interests of the City of London. Mrs Woolf is likely to be called before the Home Affairs committee of MPs within weeks to be quizzed on her links to Lord and Lady Brittan.

Last night there was silence from the Home Office about the allegations.

Home Secretary Theresa May already suffered a damaging blow when her first choice for the inquiry, Lady Butler-Sloss, withdrew after it emerged her brother was Attorney General at the time some of the alleged abuse took place in the 1980s. The inquiry was announced in July after pressure from MPs and campaigners following claims about historic child sex abuse.

It has been alleged Establishment figures covered up abuse in schools, hospitals, and churches dating back more than 30 years. The inquiry will examine what government, political parties and MI5 knew at the time.

Lord Brittan accepts he received the so-called Dickens dossier from MP Geoffrey Dickens in 1983 but says he passed it to Home Office officials.

He has also been questioned by police over allegations he raped a 19-year-old in 1967. Lord Brittan has never been arrested or charged and denies all allegations against him.

Mrs Woolf could not be reached for comment last night.
