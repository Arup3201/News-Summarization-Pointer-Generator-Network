It's fair to say Mesut Ozil has struggled to adapt to life at Arsenal, but the Gunners midfielder is no quitter and says he is not interested in a move away from the Barclays Premier League this summer.

Ozil arrived in north London for a fee of £42million from Real Madrid in 2013 and has drawn criticism for his lack of impact in his first season-and-a-half at the Emirates Stadium.

But Ozil says he is now working harder than ever as Arsenal look to reignite their season after their Champions League exit in Monaco, with a charge up the Barclays Premier League table and an FA Cup semi-final against Reading on the horizon.

Questioned on whether he would consider a move back to the Bundesliga after beginning his career there with Schalke, Ozil refuted any chances of quitting Arsenal.

'A return to Germany is not an option for me right now. I am really happy at Arsenal and I want this to continue,' Ozil he told German paper Express.

'I played in the Bundesliga and at Real Madrid. But the English Premier League is the strongest league in the world. Opponents never give up.

The German midfielder cannot hide his hurt at full-time, but he is determined to stick it out in north London

Ozil says he is working harder than he ever has done in his career previously with the Gunners

'Even if we’re 3-0 in front with Arsenal, the players never give up and fight until the very last second. You can only succeed here when you’re on top level physically. 

'I’m working as hard as I never worked before in my life. My body is more stable and I feel fresher. You need that in England.'

Ozil played the full 90 minutes of the 2-0 win at the Stade Louis II on Tuesday, but that wasn't enough to overturn a 3-1 deficit from the first leg and Arsene Wenger's men crashed out on away goals.

Despite his midweek exertions, the Germany international is expected to feature in Saturday's return to the Premier League against Newcastle United at St James' Park.
