Hundreds of people lined the entrance to a Washington state high school as it reopened on Monday, more than a week after a student fatally shot three of his classmates, wounded two others and then killed himself.

Waving well-wishers, many holding candles, greeted students returning to Marysville-Pilchuck High School following the October 24 shooting. People cheered as buses and cars entered the school campus.

A 10.30am assembly started the school day, and lunch was in the gym because the cafeteria where the shooting took place remains closed. The normal class schedule, with its earlier start, resumes on Tuesday.

Washington Governor Jay Inslee asked residents to wear red and white — the school colors.

The colors stand out vividly in a memorial with flowers, balloons and messages of love that covers the fence around the school.

The shooter, Jaylen Fryberg, 15, a popular freshman who had recently been named a homecoming prince, died of a self-inflicted wound after opening fire.

Zoe Galasso, 14, was killed during the shooting; Gia Soriano, 14, died on October 26; and Shaylee Chuckulnaskit, 14, died on Friday.

Two other students remain hospitalized at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. 

Andrew Fryberg, 15, was in critical condition and Nate Hatch, 14, was in satisfactory condition. Both are Jaylen Fryberg's cousins.

The teenage gunman opened fire on a group of his best friends and family members involved in a tragic love triangle.

Shaylee Chuckulnaski passed away on Friday at the Providence Medical Center as a result of 'severe injuries'.

Her friend Gia Soriano, 14, and the girl the schoolboy gunman had a crush on, Zoe Galasso, 14, were also killed in the tragic shooting.

Andrew Fryberg, 15, and Mr Hatch, 14, were the shooter's cousins and Ms Soriano and Ms Chuckulnaskit, also 14, were close friends of the group.

Shaylee's family said in a statement: 'Our hearts are broken at the passing of our beautiful daughter. Shay means everything to us.'

It has been claimed Jaylen had a crush on Zoe Galasso and became heartbroken when she dated his cousin, Andrew.

Ms Galasso was sitting around a table with her friends at Marysville-Pilchuck High School on Friday when Jaylen Fryberg opened fire.

She was pictured attending the homecoming dance at the Washington school with Andrew Fryberg after she and Jaylen Fryberg fell out, just days before the deadly attack. 

Jaylen had previously treated Andrew like a brother, and was devastated to learn the girl who rejected him and chosen his cousin instead.

In an ominous indication of the anger that spurred his deadly tirade, Jaylen tweeted last month: 'Dude. She tells me everything. And now I f***ing HATE you! Your no longer my 'Brother'!'

The teenage girls are believed to be friends of Jaylen Fryberg, with witnesses suggesting he targeted them in a room full of hundreds of students.
