Just decades ago it was a derelict wreck - a relic of an agricultural past long in decline.

But this windmill in Kirkham, Lancashire has been converted into a stunning luxury home worth as much as £650,000.

The property - appropriately called Wynde Milne - was built in 1812 but by the end of the century it was dormant and decaying.

Views: The home boasts two balconies, as well as two bathrooms and a large garden

Conversion: The three-storey windmill used to be derelict, but is now a luxury five-bedroom home

Inside: The home has been painstakingly converted, and makes innovative use of the mill's unique architecture

Derelict: Wynde Milne in Kirkham, Lancashire, stood ruined until a local builder converted it in 1973

Ruined: It is thought the windmill fell into disrepair around the end of the 19th century

In 1973 a local builder bought up the three-floor location and turned it into a serviceable house. But it was years later that current owners Brian and Sandra Peet, both 66, unlocked its true potential.

The home boasts five double bedrooms, two en-suite bathrooms, two reception rooms, a modern breakfast kitchen, utility room, two balconies and a large garden.

Mr Peet, who has four children and 10 grandchildren, said: 'We bought it because we knew it would make the perfect family home.

'We’re not crazy about windmills or anything like that but we just thought it was a beautiful house. We are both from this area and Sandra used to play in it when she was a little girl and it was derelict.

'The whole town is built around it and we’d always said it would make a great place to live. I’ve loved living here. The views are beautiful and you can see right up to the Lake District.'

Grand: The owners said that the entire village is built around the windmill

Approach: The handsome property has taken years to perfect, and is now on the market for £650,000

Grounds: The windmill also has a large garden

After 17 years of owning the windmill Mr and Mrs Peet have decided to sell up - and look set to reap their rewards as it has been placed on the market for £650,000.

Mr Peet said: 'The place still has lots of character. Inside there’s lots of exposed brick, which dates back to when it was built.

'In the garden there are two original mill stones and there is an old original wooden beam in the lounge.

'I really think it’s one of the nicest properties in this part of the world and to actually live in a windmill and be part of that heritage is fantastic.

'My kids and grandkids have all loved playing in it and I think we’ll really miss it when we go.

'Having said that, it’s time to move on and I really hope whoever buys it will take good care of it and enjoy living here'.

Heyday: This painting, dated 1989, shows Wynde Milne before it fell into disrepair

Richard Schofield, who works for Country Lane estate agents, which is marketing the windmill at £650,000, said it requires minimal maintenance and only needs painting once every 10 years.

Richard said: 'As soon as you walk in the front entrance, which is not a normal entrance, you are confronted by a huge spiral stair case up to the first floor, which is the living area.

'The windmill boasts fantastic views of the surrounding area'.
