A former college professor who underwent a double arm transplant last month at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston says the best thing about the operation is that he's able to hug his loved ones again.

Will Lautzenheiser with both arms still in partial casts on Tuesday — said at a news conference he's grateful to the anonymous donor who 'will always be as close to me as my own skin.'

Lautzenheiser is a former professor of film production and screenwriting at Boston University and Montana State University who became a quadruple amputee in 2011 following a streptococcal infection.

Before his illness: Will Lautzenheiser, pictured here before falling ill, lost both arms following a streptococcal infection back in 2011 but luckily had life changing arm transplant surgery last month 

Hard work: Will Lautzenheiser's rehabilitation hasn't been easy but he hasn't given up and now that he's received a double arm transplant he can hug his loved ones once again 

He underwent a nearly nine-hour operation last month that involved 13 surgeons.

In June, when the surgery was announced, Lautzenheiser told the Boston Herald he was afraid, but could not wait for the day he can hug his niece and his partner and hold a camera once again so he can pursue his dreams of becoming a filmmaker.

'There’s a goal,' he said before the life changing surgery.

The Massachusetts native had already started a second career as a club comic before the transplant. 

Because he's in a wheel chair,  Lautzenheiser humorously calls himself a 'sit down comic.'

Those who are interested in learning more about Lautzenheiser's story can watch a ten minute documentary called Stumped about his rehabilitation and how he managed to pursue his goals as a filmmaker and performer despite being a quadruple amputee.

Humor has been a powerful coping mechanism for Lautzenheiser and the Boston Globe reports that at a press conference back in June a video of Lautzenheiser's stand up brought the crowd to chuckles.

'I keep you on your toes,' Lautzenheiser said to a club audience in the video, 'because I don’t have any.'

Back in June Lautzenheiser said he hoped his surgery can pave the way for other amputees requiring medical care and mentioned the victims of the Boston Marathon bombing who were left without limbs.

'We’ve shown we really are Boston strong, and that’s not just a catch phrase,' he said. 

'The support we’ve given to people who have disabilities, however they’ve been obtained, is huge.'

Sense of humor: Will Lautzenheiser hasn't let his being an amputee stop him from living a fulfilling life
