An Australian start-up company is considering launching legal action against US tech giant Apple, alleging it stole the name it trades under for a mobile app.

The company with two owners and a small headquarters in Melbourne, is but a speck in the market when it comes to a company like Apple, but it appears they liked the Australian brand so much 'They have used our name and launched a new product called HealthKit,' company co-founder Alison Hardacre said.

Ms Hardacre's fury boiled over on Tuesday morning when she woke just after 4.30am to emails informing her that one of the world's biggest companies had stolen her business name.

HealthKit is the name she and co-founder Lachlan Wheeler launched back in 2012, two years before Apple launched its software application at Silicon Valley, California on Tuesday. It has just themselves, a few application designers and some investors in its minnow operations compared to the US conglomerate.

The Australian HealthKit version is designed to streamline health services for people online. It works by connecting health practitioners, such as doctors to clients to access health records, data and other useful information. Apple's HealthKit app lets users measure the body's performance when exercising, such as the heart rate, calories burned, blood sugar, cholesterol and keeps a record of that data all in one place.

Speaking to MailOnline about the alleged copyright infringement, Ms Hardacre said: 'We won't let them trample over our product ... someone needs to be fired for this.'

'We have a business with the same name and a similar product, if they had done a quick Google search they (Apple) would have seen that. It's not fair.'

While Apple said its version will 'revolutionise' health, Ms Hardacre has other ideas. She and her business partner said they were considering it's options over whether they would sue. She also said repeated attempts to contact the company have gone unanswered.

MailOnline has also attempted to contact Apple over the allegations, without success.

'We knew Apple were going into health but didn't expect this,' she said. The morning she found out about the alleged thievery of the company name, she posted to a blog on the company's website: 'HealthKit is already in use, by us!

Ms Hardacre said any reasonable company, let alone Apple, would have taken steps to ensure that a name is not already in use. A quick Google search would have returned the Australian HealthKit at the top of the search engine's list.

'it would have taken five seconds to type www.healthkit.com into their browser and discover us. Would it have made any difference to them? Are they so big that they are above doing an ordinary Google search?'

'This is just not right. We have had these great ambitions to make health better for customers.'

It is not the first time Apple has been embroiled in allegations of trademark-infringement. In 2010 the company settled with Cisco, a company that designs, manufactures, and sells networking equipment, over a trademark-infringement lawsuit for the use of the iPhone name.

Cisco sued the company after Apple unveiled its long-awaited multimedia phone, a name already claimed by the network equipment maker.

Apple was also embroiled in a legal stoush with Apple Corps, the music company owned by the Beatles, between 1978 and 2006 over the use of the Apple name. The two companies settled for an undisclosed price back in 2007.

Ms Hardacre said at the very least Apple should 'apologise'.Â  'As an Apple fan, I feel let down.'
