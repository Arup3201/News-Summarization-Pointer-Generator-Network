Aircraft manufacturer Boeing has insisted its 787 Dreamliner jets - the world's first carbon-plastic passenger plane - are still safe to fly, despite 'flaws' found in the fuselage of one of its models.

Boeing reported signs of 'delamination' on a support structure in the rear fuselage earlier this month - the latest in a series of glitches in developing the revolutionary jet.

Delamination occurs when repeated stress causes laminated composite materials to begin to separate.

Revolutionary: The Boeing 787 Dreamliner is the world's first carbon-plastic passenger plane

The company is now examining a backlog of assembled Dreamliners to see whether they show similar signs of stress, which it has blamed on incorrect 'shimming' - a process planemakers use to fill tiny gaps when aircraft are built.

James Albaugh, chief executive officer of 
Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said during a media briefing in Singapore: 'All the airplanes that were built up to plane 55 have the potential for the shimming issue.'

However, Albaugh said the problem was 'very fixable'.

He added: 'We are in the process of fixing the airplanes that are in the (production) flow.

'There is no safety or flight issue on the airplanes that we have delivered.'

Although composite parts have been in use for years, the 787 is the first airliner built mainly out of the new materials, which help airlines save fuel by reducing aircraft weight.       

What dreams are made of: Inside the pioneering aircraft... but Boeing has insisted the plane is still safe to fly, in spite of its flaws

Albaugh said the inspections might affect delivery of the aircraft to customers in the short term, but Boeing still expects to meet its target for this year.               

The first six aircraft produced are generally test models.               

Analysts have said the discovery of the flaw after the first delivery of the aircraft last September has raised questions about whether Boeing can meet what many already saw as an ambitious plan to raise output to 10 Dreamliners a month by the end of 2013.

Kenneth Herbert, Wedbush Securities analyst, said: 'People pretty much understood when the 
news came out initially that it would affect the majority of the 
Dreamliners that had been produced, because it was a workmanship issue. 
So I don't think this will be too much of an overhang on the stock.'  

Boeing currently makes 2.5 Dreamliners each month and expects to boost monthly output to 3.5 in the second quarter and to five by the end of the year.

Herbert said many aviation experts and stock analysts expect Boeing to miss its production rate target next year and have already priced that view into the company's shares.      

Boeing has so far delivered five of the aircraft to Japan's All Nippon Airways, which has put the plane into regular passenger service since December 1.

Due to production problems, that was three years later than originally planned.

Japan Airlines has already said it no longer expects its first Dreamliner by the end of February as a result of the manufacturing glitch.         

The 787 problem comes as Boeing rival Airbus investigates the cause of cracks in part of the wings of its A380 superjumbo. It also insists its jets are safe.

Airbus Chief Executive Officer Tom Enders pledged last week the plane-maker would apply lessons from the A380 glitches to the development of the A350, which is the European company's carbon-composite answer to the 787 Dreamliner.      

Boeing will decide whether to go ahead with plans to produce a stretched, or longer, version of the 787 Dreamliner by the end of this year, Albaugh said.       

Most aircraft analysts expected Boeing to push ahead with the 787-10, which would carry around 320 people, 40 more than the longest 787 version currently on offer, the 787-9.
