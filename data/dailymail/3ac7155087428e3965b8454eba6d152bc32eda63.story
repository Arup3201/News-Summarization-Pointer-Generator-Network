Prince Harry will spend several weeks based in Australia in the next few months before attending the centenary Anzac dawn service in Gallipoli with his father Prince Charles.

Harry will be seconded to work with the Australian defence forces during his time in Australia before quitting the British military altogether later this year, London's Evening Standard reported on Friday.

It's suggested he'll also travel to New Zealand but not work with any units there.

'Officials are still working on the precise timings but he will leave the (UK) military this year after serving Down Under,' a senior source told the newspaper.

'Before that he will travel to both countries and be based there and is very much looking forward to that.

'The exact timings have not been finalised yet but are expected to be announced officially very soon.'

The governor-generals' offices in both Australia and New Zealand are reportedly still working on Harry's program. 

The prince, who is the fourth in line to the British throne, has served two tours of duty in Afghanistan.

The Evening Standard reports that after the 30-year-old quits the military he'll focus on charity work, spending a significant period abroad on field projects in Africa.

Prince Harry is keen to pursue his interests in 'conservation and wildlife' and hopes to spend a 'significant period abroad' on field projects in Africa.

The Prince, known as Captain Harry Wales in the military, will also focus on programmes to aid the rehabilitation of injured service personnel, the Evening Standard reported.

This will follow on from his work in the wake of the Invictus Games, ensuring wounded, injured or sick serviceman have appropriate individual recovery plans. 

Harry is expected to join his father Prince Charles at the 100th anniversary Anzac Day dawn service at Gallipoli in April.

Australian sources say the Prince is expected to fulfill several other non-military public duties Down Under. 

A spokesman for Kensington Palace said: 'Prince Harry is currently focused on his work supporting the Ministry of Defence's recovery capability programme to ensure those who are wounded, injured or sick have appropriate recovery plans and the necessary support they require.

'It's a natural progression from the work he did organising the Invictus Games. This involves working alongside case officers in London District's personal recovery unit and visiting various recovery centres and partner agencies (such as forces charities and the NHS) around the country.'

A senior source told the Standard: 'The Prince thought long and hard about his decision to leave active military service but, having served his country on two tours of duty, he felt the time was right to leave. He has loved his time serving.
