The family of a 24-year-old woman not seen since she broke up with her boyfriend in May have spoken out after remains discovered on Saturday were confirmed to be her.

Reported missing by her family on May 1, Mandy Matula has been found in a park in Stearns County, MN. She died from a single gunshot would to the head, according to the coroner.

Her ex-boyfriend, David Roe, was named as a 'person of interest,' but committed suicide before investigators were able to question him in her disappearance. There had been no trace of her until this weekend.

Despite the grim news, her family shared a mixture of sadness and relief at the closure brought by the news and also wanted people to know he was a good person, calling him a 'sweetheart.'

Not mad: Steven Matula says his family wants people to know that Mr Roe was a good guy, and that the murder-suicide wasn't in his nature

'She was a very loved daughter, sister and a friend,' brother Steven, 22, wrote on Facebook. 'May Mandy rest in peace, and let her shine through all of us as we go about our daily lives.'

The relieved relative then thanked everyone who helped search for his sister before telling his sister he loves her.

The grisly discovery was made Saturday at 2pm 
today by a hiker at Mississippi River Park, which was searched many times by investigators after Ms Matula went missing.

'We can finally have Mandy at rest, a lot of weight has been taken off my shoulders,' her brother told CBS Minnesota, adding 'we’ve been waiting for this day to come... Mandy is finally coming home.'

Mandy's brother also went out of his way to speak well of Mr Roe.

He told CBS Minnesota that Mr Roe is a good man, that the murder-suicide wasn't in his character and that people need to know that wasn't the type of person he was, before joining his father in praise of the suspected killer at a press conference.

Such a tragedy: Mandy Matula's life ended violently, alone, and in the dark

'He was such a really good guy,' the 22-year-old told the station. 'He was a sweetheart.'

'Dave was a really good guy overall, brother Steven said of Roe during a Saturday press conference. 'He was well-mannered and was a gentleman. I can't say anything bad about him.'

'He was very cordial to me and was a nice guy,' father Wayne added.

There is amazingly no animosity towards the man that killed Mandy Matula from her family.

'The whole family was flabbergasted that Dave did something like this,' brother Steven added.

Her grieving father also said during the press conference that he's grateful to bring this horror to end and that the family is planning a funeral.

'To actually see where it took place, it will bring closure,' Wayne Matula shared. 'That’s forever going to be in our hearts.'

'It’s hard, because we waited this long,' friend Leah Foster told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. 'We knew it was coming, but it’s hard when it happens.'

Her final resting place: Ms Matula's remains were discovered Saturday by a hiker in Mississippi River Park, in Eden Prairie

Multiple searches: Despite several search efforts in that very park, Mandy Matula's remains went undiscovered since May - until now

They never gave up: The Matula family was actually planning to search the park again this weekend, according to her brother

Mr Matula told KSTP that investigators found a sweatshirt with a University of Minnesota-Duluth logo and the number 14 near the remains. Ms Matula's class ring was also found on the body, according to reports, leading police to believe it was Mandy.

She wore number 14 when she played softball at UND, a number synonymous with her throughout her playing career - she was born on January 14, the father added.

The county medical examiner confirmed in a Sunday autopsy the remains are those of Ms Matula. She died of a single gunshot wound to the head, a coroner's report cited by KAAL said.

All that remains of their beloved Mandy are her bones, the family said during the press conference, there is evidence animals found her corpse.

Authorities do not believe she was killed in the park, and think perhaps not even in the surrounding area, but they do not have a location for her death. The park her body was discovered in is over 80 miles from her Duluth home, KAAL noted.

Concerned family: Mandy, seen here with brother Steve, told friends and relatives that she had planned to break up with Roe before she went missing

Such promise: Mandy's family grew concerned when she failed to show up to her job Thursday morning

Ms Matula and Mr Roe dated for a while, both were standout athletes in high school and college.

He
 was all-conference in football while playing for a state championship 
team before attending the University of St. Thomas - where he continued 
his football career.

Mandy worked as a seasonal maintenance worker for the city of Eden 
Prairie for more than six years, and she also worked at a family 
recreation center in Eden Prairie, Brunswick Zone XL.

Mr Roe was the last person to see Ms Matula alive. He told investigators he last saw her at 1:30am on the day she was reported missing. He said she got out of his car.

That was all her family had to go on, now they now the rest of the story. Ms Matula's family finally has closure.
