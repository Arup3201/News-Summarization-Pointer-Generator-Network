This is the dramatic moment anti-terror police carried out a dawn raid on a flat just a mile from the scene where a soldier was brutally murdered.

Armed police officers sealed off the street in Greenwich, south-east London, and burst into the flat at around 6am today.

Four people were seen been led away from the address and put into police vans. Neighbours said police quietly carried out the raids and many of them did not realise what was happening.

The raids were carried out after Drummer Lee Rigby, 25, was horrifically murdered by two people in Woolwich yesterday afternoon.

Drummer Rigby was just starting his Army career and had recently fought in Afghanistan with the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers.

One of the suspected killers has been identified as Michael Adebolajo, 28, while the other man has not been named.

It is thought that the second suspect's girlfriend may live in the flat.

Neighbours claimed that the family in the house kept them up with Islamic chanting.

Residents in the Greenwich estate said 
that one of the woman staying at the house, thought to be the girlfriend
 of one of the killers, converted to Islam two and a half years ago.

Neighbour Nicola James, 45, said of 
the family: 'When you walked passed you would hear them singing Muslim 
songs. You would hear them chanting through the windows.

'The woman I think he went out with wore a full niqab. She converted to Islam about two and a half years ago.

'There’s a teenage boy who lives there
 sometimes too. He used to cause trouble on my part of the estate. He 
came over to my part of the estate once and my dog bit him.

'The family tried to take me to court but I won the case.'

The soldier murdered in Woolwich, who was wearing a 
Help for Heroes top, was hit by a Vauxhall Tigra on the pavement before 
two crazed men attacked him with knives in a suspected terror attack.

Witnesses said the suspects 'hacked 
and chopped' at his body and were shouting 'Allah Akbar!' - an Islamic 
phrase meaning 'God is great' - and yelling 'this is what God would have
 wanted.'

A man identified as Adebolajo who ranted on camera with a clear south London 
accent saying 'you people will never be safe'.

The suspected killers were later shot by police and will be questioned by anti-terror officers once they have recovered.

William Bennett, 38, a father-of-three, said he had seen the murder suspect at the property.

'I have seen the man coming and going. I’ve seen the man in the green jacket walking around,' he said.

'I didn’t pay any attention to him when I was here but when I saw the TV last night I recognised him straight away. I turned to my partner and said to her "I’ve seen him".

'I was told that he was the boyfriend of the sister in that flat. I was absolutely shocked when I saw his face on telly. I just thought "bloody hell, I’ve seen him".

Probe: Police have refused to confirm details of the raid, although it is understood that four people were arrested

'I got this morning at 6am to walk my dog and I saw a police van and a few policemen, which isn’t unusual around here.

'But then I saw armed police. They were bringing a woman up the road in handcuffs. I went around the back and saw armed police behind a tree, pointing their guns at the house. One was looking into the back window.

'The one behind the tree saw me and told me to get off the estate, so I did. I heard shouting. The woman was wearing pink pyjama bottoms and a black top.

'The police had also taken a teenage boy out of the house. He was sat across the road on a wall, handcuffed.

'I’m really shocked at what has happened.'

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police tonight refused to comment on the raid.
