The rebels had earlier boasted they were receiving 150 armoured vehicles, including 30 tanks, and 1,200 soldiers who were ‘trained in Russia’.

Moscow continues to deny sending military equipment or personnel into Ukrainian territory, but large convoys have been seen massing on the Russian side of the border.

Meanwhile some 16 lorries from a 280-strong Russian convoy carrying humanitarian aid for eastern Ukraine arrived at a rebel-held border crossing yesterday. Kiev insists any aid should cross a government-controlled part of the border.

Ukraine appears to be making progress in efforts to quell the rebellion.

More
 than 2,000 people have been killed since mid-April, when Ukraine’s 
government sent troops to put down an uprising by pro-Russian 
separatists in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

Ukrainian forces 
yesterday took back a police station in the city of Luhansk, which had 
been held by pro-Russian rebels since April.

After weeks of bitter 
clashes, the Ukrainian flag was raised above the building – in a move 
hailed by commanders as a crucial breakthrough.

But rebels continue 
to hold out in other areas and appear to be reinforced by fresh supplies
 of troops and equipment from over the border.

There is growing evidence
 Russia is directly supporting the rebellion, despite repeated denials 
from Moscow that seemed to be contradicted at the weekend by rebel 
leaders.

which about 30 are tanks and the rest are BMPs and BTRs [infantry 
fighting vehicles and armoured personnel carriers], 1,200 military 
personnel, who are there now, who underwent training for four months on 
the territory of the Russian Federation. They were brought into action 
at the most crucial moment.’
