Suspended Miami Dolphins guard Richie Incognito claims he also received threatening text messages from former teammate Jonathan Martin, and that they often spoke vulgarly.

Mr 
Incognito told Fox 'NFL Sunday' that he and his fellow offensive lineman often spoke in such a threatening manner, that it was all just good-natured joking. He also showed a message sent from Mr Martin threatening to 'kill your whole f****g family.'

'Before this all
went down, Jonathan Martin texted me on my phone ‘I will murder your 
whole effing family,' Mr Incognito recalled. That was one of 1,142 text messages exchanged between the two men, Fox Sports' Jay Glazer reported.

Still making excuses: Richie Incognito told Fox he regrets his choice of words, but still excuses it as part of team culture

'I knew it was coming from a friend, from a teammate, that
just puts a context on [the words].'

The offensive lineman said that was an example of the language also used by 
Mr Martin as proof of the context of the aggressive language use among 
teammates.

Fox Sports reporter Jay Glazer uncovered 1,142 texts exchanged between the former teammates over the past year, many of them too vulgar to share on-air.

Mr Incognito said that he's embarrassed the message was made public, but also explained that he and fellow offensive linemen speak vulgarly to each other a on a regular basis.

'What I want people to know is, the way Jonathan and the rest of the offensive line and how our teammates how we communicate, it’s vulgar.'

'When the words are put in the context, I understand why a lot of eyebrows get raised, but people don’t know how Jon and I communicate to one another,' he added.

The accused bully claimed during the interview that Mr Martin spoke with him via text only days after leaving the team on a Monday. The team had won that Thursday, the two men spoke the next day,

'Wassup man? The world’s gotten crazy LOL I’m good tho
congrats on the win,' Mr Martin texted his accused tormenter.

When asked what was going on, Mr Martin denied sharing the vulgar messages with the public and said he didn't know where it was coming from.

'Yeah
I’m good man. It’s insane bro, but just know that I don’t blame you guys at
all it’s just the culture around football and the locker room got to me a
little,' he texted Mr incognito.

The former all-pro said he 'never meant to hurt anyone,' and explained that the 'private messages' were left 'as a joke' for a friend.

'It sounds like I'm a racist pig, like I'm a meathead, it sounds like a lot of things I'm not,' he added.

'I'm a good person.'

Speaking in a calm, matter of fact tone, with not even a hint of nervousness, Mr Incognito said he was Mr Martin's best friend on the team.

'This is an issue of my and John's relationship. You can ask
anybody in the Miami Dolphins locker room,' Mr Incognito said in one excerpt.

We were best friends: Mr Incognito said more than once that he was Mr Martin's best friend on the team

'I'm embarassed': Mr Incognito said the messages were private and meant as a joke, but that he is embarrassed they were made public

'Who had John Martin's back the
absolute most?' and they will undoubtedly tell you me,' he continued.

He further explained his amazement at what has transpired, saying that Mr Martin never let on the vulgar language was bothering him

'John
never showed signs that football was getting to him, the locker room was
getting to him,' Mr Incognito asserted.

The footballer then said that he 'never saw it coming,' and that the media's portrayal of him as a bully is 'not even close.'

He also admitted he understands why people might see him as a 'knucklehead' or a 'loose cannon' and said that his usage of the n-word isn't uncommon in NFL locker rooms, even by Mr Martin, but that still doesn't excuse his bahavior.

'I’m not a racist... [but] in no way
shape or form is it right for me to use that word,' said a contrite Mr Incognito.

Mr Incognito then thanked his Dolphins teammates for standing up for him, 'for telling the truth,' when the media descending on the locker room and started asking questions.

'All this stuff coming out... speaks to the culture of our locker room,' Mr Incognito continued.

'It speaks to the culture of our closeness, it speaks to the culture of our brotherhood.'

'I never saw it coming': The offensive lineman said he regrets not seeing that the vulgar joking was bother Mr Martin, he wishes he could have done something

'I'm sorry': The footballer said he would apologize to both Mr Martin and his family if he had the opportunity, and admitted things may have gone too far

When asked what he'd say if Mr Martin was sitting next to him, Mr Incognito said he'd give him a hug say he is sorry.

I think I’d give him a big hug right now because we’ve been through so much and I’d be like, 'dude what’s going on?'

'If he were to say 'listen, you took it way to far, you hurt me,' You know I would just apologize and explain to him exactly what I just explained to you, and I’d apologize to his family, they took it as malicious,' Mr Incognito continued. 'I never meant it that way.'

The nine-year pro was interviewed Saturday in Los Angeles by Mr Glazer, who mostly kept the promise made earlier on Twitter that he wouldn’t hold back in his questioning. Mr Incognito was photographed leaving Los Angeles International Airport a day earlier.

Questions
are expected to cover the NFL’s investigation into the Dolphins as 
allegations of racism and abuse run rampant through the locker room.

'The racism, the bad words,' Mr Incognito said, looking down and taking a pause before adding 'that's what I regret most.'

Calling
the shocking speech 'a product of our environment,' Mr Incognito then 
further excuses the vulgar talk as 'something we use all the time.'

The interview comes after fresh allegations against Incognito including claims he molested a female volunteer with a golf club during a team-sponsored charity golf tournament last year, according to reports.

The harassment allegation became public after WPLG obtained a copy of the police report filed May 18, 2012 by the 34-year-old woman.

Mr Incognito’s lewd behavior occurred during the annual Fins Weekend Golf Tournament at the Turnberry Resort and Club, the incident report said.

The woman accused the footballer of using a golf club to rub her privates and knock her glasses off her head, a copy of the report reviewed by MailOnline alleges.

The woman said Mr Incognito had been drinking during the event.

‘After that, he proceeded to lean up against her buttocks with his private parts as if dancing, saying ‘Let it rain, Let it Rain!’ The report said.

‘He finally finished his inappropriate behavior by emptying bottled water in her face,’ said the report.The woman told cops arriving on the scene that several people saw the inappropriate behaviour and did nothing to stop it.

Had Mr Incognito simply apologized, it does not appear she would have filed the report.

Instead, ‘she felt like he didn't care and thought the whole incident was in fun and games,’ the report reads. ‘Other people apologized for him, but not him.’

Dolphins team security said they would handle the issue when it was brought to their attention, but the woman told authorities nothing was done.

The woman is not allowed to speak publicly about the incident after signing a confidentiality agreement, according to WPLG.

The golf outing accusation is the third in a series of shocking stories involving the previously under-the-radar football player.

Last month, a series of voicemails left for teammate Jonathan Martin emerged that showed Mr Incognito using racial slurs and threatening physical violence against him.

Mr Incognito was suspended indefinitely from the team while an investigation is carried out.

Mr Martin has since left the team to seek counseling, and accused unspecified teammates of threatening to rape his sister.

In the time since his suspension, Mr Incognito has told those close to him that he feels betrayed by Mr Martin, a rookie that other Dolphins have publicly said the veteran took under his wing.

A source told ESPN the allegations 'shocked' Mr Incognito, and that he feels betrayed.

'It's probably a combination of totally blindsided and a bit betrayed,' the source told the network. 'He's shocked. He can't believe this happened and thinks it probably could have been avoided.'

To his credit, several teammates have spoken out in favor of Mr Incognito, and also said many of the comments were taken out of context.

'I don't think what happened is necessary,' teammate Tyson Clabo told ESPN. 'I don't know why he's doing this. And the only person who knows why is Jonathan Martin.'

Just this past week, a video emerged of an out-of-control, drunk, shirtless Mr Incognito rampaging through a bar shouting the n-word as terrified patrons dove for cover.

The team has not publicly commented on the two latest incidents.
