It was a simple mission: to build a half-eagle half-horse robot.

But creating Buckbeack the Hippogriff was hardly magical for the artists who airbrushed thousands of goose and chicken feathers one-by-one before piecing them together with tweezers.

The animatronic beast is receiving his first makeover since a team of 20 took four months to create him for the Harry Potter films 12 years ago - and this time is proving just as challenging.

The magical creature with the wings and head of an eagle and body and tail of a horse featured in the third book of JK Rowling's series, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.

Harry and Hermione free the haughty Buckbeak - sentenced to death for attacking a pupil - and he helps Harry's outlaw godfather Sirius Black escape a similar fate.

Film costume expert and 'featherologist' Val Jones, who made the original creature, has been drafted back in to recreate one of the books' most popular animals.

She told MailOnline: 'Buckbeak was one of the most challenging creatures I’ve ever worked on.

'It took almost a year and a team of 20 to build three versions of him. We worked closely with mechanical engineers to replicate the exact wing movement and skeleton of a real bird.

'Each version required thousands of feathers to be sorted, dyed and then individually glued in place by hand.

'As
 the Buckbeak on show [in London] is more than 12 years old now, it’s 
important to refresh and replenish his coat as the glue wears and 
feathers come loose when he bows.'

Buckbeak’s coat consists of thousands 
of real goose and chicken feathers, which were individually airbrushed 
with dye and then hand-glued with a spatula onto a net underneath.

The models were mechanically fitted so the wings, neck, eyes and 
beak could all move.

In other scenes, the Hippogriff was created digitally and the cast were given props such as a beak 
on a stick with which to interact on set.

Ms
 Jones, who also worked on Fawkes the phoenix and Hedwig the owl, said 
despite her experience Buckbeak - who is the size of a real horse - took
 another three months to replenish.

Loyalty: The film version of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban starred Daniel Radcliffe

Magical: The bird appears in Hagrid the gamekeeper's pumpkin patch but is sentenced to death for an attack

Painstaking: Ms Jones said she had to paint the feathers individually and put them in place with tweezers

Project: The magical creature has the wings and head of an eagle and body and tail and hind legs of a horse

Some of the feathers on Buckbeak's wings are even more complex, as they were made out of plastic using a mould.

Ms Jones added: 'I’ve worked in the industry specialising
 in fur and feathers for over 30 years working on a range of films from 
101 Dalmatians, Willow, Labyrinth, The Witches, Indiana Jones and the 
Last Crusade and Babe.'

The model is being re-feathered and preened for the Warner Bros Studio Tour near Watford, Hertfordshire.

Holders of an £89 family ticket will be able to see Ms Jones and her team live at work from April 4 to April 27.

The eight Harry Potter films grossed an estimated £4.6billion at box offices worldwide - with hundreds of millions more in DVD sales and merchandise.

Birds of a feather: Ms Jones has worked on several similar creatures including Hedwig the owl
