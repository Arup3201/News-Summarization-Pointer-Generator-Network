Four first responders have been placed on 'modified desk duty' following the death of an asthmatic, obese man after he was placed in a chokehold by a NYPD officer on Thursday.

The two paramedics and two emergency medical technicians work for Richmond University Medical Center in Staten Island, a FDNY source told MailOnline.

As part of 'modified desk duty,' the employees can't answer emergency calls during an investigation into 43-year-old Eric Garner's death, the source explained.

Meanwhile, Rev. Al Sharpton delivered a sermon in the wake of Garner's death at the Riverside Church in Manhattan on Sunday. 

Sharpton contrasted the Staten Island man's death with the circumstances surrounding another man who died twenty years ago following an altercation with NYPD officers - but said 'there's a video this time.'

'What bothers me is that the nation 
watches a man saying "I can't breathe" and the choking continues. "I 
can't breathe," and it continues,' Sharpton said in a sermon uploaded online by the church.

'"I can't breathe" and
 police surround him, and none of them even say "Wait a minute, stop. He
 can't breathe,"' he said.

'Even if 
police procedure doesn't kick in, when does your sense of humanity kick 
in?' Sharpton continued, to applause from parishioners. 'When does our 
consideration of human beings kick in? Have we gotten so cold and 
withdrawn and inflexible to even people fighting for their breath does 
not appeal to something inside of us?'

Shocking video emerged Saturday of 
the minutes after Garner was put in a chokehold that 
may have killed him - and it was revealed that the cop responsible has had his gun and badge 
stripped.

Garner died shortly after he was thrown to the ground and choked-out by NYPD 
officers outside the Staten Island store in which he worked.

This new 
footage shows him unresponsive on the ground for several minutes before 
help arrives.

The video picks up where another disturbing video left off, with the man seemingly unconscious after the violent arrest.

Officers Daniel Pantaleo and Justin Damico have since been placed on desk duty, with Pantaleo forced to hand in his gun and badge, according to the New York Daily News, which originally made the original video public.

The second video shows Garner on his side on the ground as a crowd builds around him. Police first try to make the person capturing the footage leave, but they do not.

Cops try to talk with Garner, but he does not respond - his eyes are closed and his head is on the sidewalk.

They openly wonder if he still has a pulse, and one officer presses his fingers to Garner's neck and says he does.

People keep asking why they aren't doing CPR, and paramedics do not arrive for over three minutes.

The paramedic tries communicating with Garner: 'We're here to help.'

But he does not answer.

'Here to help': garner is motionless, but a paramedic is able to confirm he still has a pulse

The paramedic checks his pulse and says he's still alive, then decides he needs to go on a stretcher.

Still not alert, Garner is rolled over and at least six cops, plus the paramedic, hoist him on to a stretcher.

Another person asks again why no CPR was performed.

'Because he's still breathing,' and officer snaps at the person.

Despite Garner's medical condition being apparent to the still-building crowd, many cops stand around casually talking with each other, some can even be heard laughing.

The footage came to light the same day his widow spoke publicly for the first time of her horror at seeing a video of her dead husband's arrest.

Esaw Garner said she was deeply upset by the footage.

The mother-of-six collapsed in tears at a Saturday press conference.

A law enforcement source told the New York Post that he officer believed to have used the chokehold, who has not yet been identified, may lose his job.

'It violates protocol. It violates a direct rule which is never to put somebody in a choke hold,' the unidentified source told the newspaper.

Earlier footage released Friday shows one officer put Garner in a chokehold - a maneuver barred under NYPD practice code - while police tried to arrest him over claims he was selling bootleg cigarettes.

Garner's wife watched footage of the arrest, and her 43-year-old husband's final moments on a sidewalk, on Friday, the New York Daily News said. 

'They killed him. They choked him and took him down and I could hear him screaming that he couldn’t breathe,' she told the newspaper, which has an exclusive copy of the film.

'It was so hard to watch. He was a non-violent gentle giant, and they killed him,' she also said.

The 46-year-old was comforted by the Reverend Al Sharpton at the Saturday press conference held by Sharpton's National Action Network.

She sobbed uncontrollably as Sharpton described the circumstances of her husband's death.

'The issue is not if one was selling [untaxed] cigarettes, the issue is that an unarmed man was subjected to a chokehold and the result is he is no longer with us,' Sharpton said.

Sharpton then joined the family on a peaceful demonstration through Staten Island, to protest the circumstances of Garner's death.

In the video Garner, who was not armed, is heard denying that he has been involved in illegal activity when a plainclothes police officer accosted him.

'Every time you see me you want to mess with me. I’m tired of it. It stops today!' Garner said.

When he is put on the ground by five cops while 
being handcuffed, Garner was yelling out that he couldn't breathe, witness Valencia Griffin told the New York Daily News.

'They jumped him and they were choking 
him. He was foaming at the mouth. And that's it. He was done,' Ramsey Orta, who took the
 video, told the newspaper.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio postponed a family trip to Italy to ensure the investigation gets underway, the Post reported. 

In a statement released Friday, he extended his sympathy to the victim's family, and promised a 'full and thorough investigation'.

'We have a responsibility to keep every New Yorker safe, and that includes when individuals are in custody of the NYPD,' de Blasio said.

Confrontation: Eric Garner was stopped by police on this sidewalk

After the incident, Staten Island Live reported that posters saying 'no justice, no peace' 'and Another innocent black man has been killed by police brutality. The NYPD must be stopped!' appeared in the area. 

The Rev Lloyd Land, from the First United Christian Church, told the website: 'He was a gentle giant. Insofar as violence, I don't believe if you smack him in the face he would hit you back ... The police have no reason to attack him.'
