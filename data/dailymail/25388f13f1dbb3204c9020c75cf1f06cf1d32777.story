Quit: PC Douglas Dishington (pictured) was forced to resign over allegations he had an affair with the wife of a man who had called for help

A police officer has quit over allegations that he had an affair with the wife of a man who had called his force for help.

Central Scotland PC Douglas Dishington - nicknamed Dishy - was 'required to resign' by the chief constable of the force after a disciplinary meeting last week.

The move follows a decision to drop criminal proceedings against the Stirling-based officer, who had at one point appeared in court charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice.

Two complaints were received by the force after Mr Dishington became involved in a tangled domestic web.

Tony Godley, of Alva, near Stirling, complained that Mr Dishington, 45, had started dating his wife Rebecca, 41, shortly after the police officer had been round to their former matrimonial home.

Mr Godley, 44, had called the police in attempt to 'give a fright' to his allegedly-unruly stepdaughter Kayleigh, now 17.

But Mr Dishington is said to have given his personal mobile number to Mrs Godley, now Rebecca Watkins, before starting an affair with her shortly afterwards.

Mr Godley also complained that Mr Dishington had given lifts to his 12-year-old son in his police car.

This included picking him up from school, and driving him home, as well as allegedly on another occasion driving him in the car while he had his blue lights on.

A second complaint also came from Kayleigh's father, Jamie Hutton, 44, of Fallin, near Stirling.

He alleged that Mr Dishington provided a false alibi for Kayleigh, whom Mr Hutton accused of going round to his house when he was out and removing cigarettes and Â£1,350 in cash.

Prior to last week's hearing, held in Dunblane Police Station under Central Scotland Police's disciplinary code, Mr Dishington had been suspended over Mr Hutton's complaint, which at one stage had led to him being charged with attempting to pervert the course of justice.

The case was later dropped.

Mr Hutton, who gave evidence at the misconduct hearing, said: 'I was out of the house and got a text from my daughter asking where I was.

'I later found out she'd been in the house and when I got home the money and cigarettes were missing.

'I asked the shop round the corner if I could see their CCTV.

'You can also see my daughter going in the house, and leaving shortly afterwards.'

He said his daughter was charged with theft, but the case was later dropped due to 'lack of evidence.'

He said: 'I was a witness at the hearing, and Dishington gave an alibi for Kayleigh, saying she wasn't there, but the CCTV shows she clearly was.'

A friend of Mr Godley said: 'Dishington's a snake. It is right he is not in the position of police officer any more.

'He came into Tony's house, in his role as a police officer, and Tony trusted him, but then Dishington runs off with his wife.

'Tony was also concerned about his son's welfare. He shouldn't be getting lifts in a police car, especially when the blue lights were on.'

Rebecca Watkins said: 'I know about the complaint my ex-husband made to the police, but don't go there - it's a long story.'

A Central Scotland Police spokesman said: 'Following a misconduct hearing, an officer has resigned from service.'
