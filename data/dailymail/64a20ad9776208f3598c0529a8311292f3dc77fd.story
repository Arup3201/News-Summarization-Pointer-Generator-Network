Defense: Jade Masters-Ownbey says the school was protecting her daughter

The Colorado school that suspended a six-year-old boy after kissing a fellow pupil has decided to allow the youngster back into the classroom.

The story of first-grader Hunter Yelton spurred outrage after word spread that his school near Colorado Springs suspended him for the kiss and then proceeded to accuse him of sexually harassing the girl.

Canon City Schools Superintendent Robin Gooldy met with Hunter's parents. The superintendent then changed Hunter's disciplinary offense from 'sexual harassment' to 'misconduct.'

The little boy has also returned to school at the Lincoln School of Science & Technology.

However, the mother of the girl he kissed has said was fully in favor of Hunter being suspended and having 'sexual harassment' listed on his record

Jade Masters-Ownbey said the school district had done a 'great job' protecting her daughter from repeated harassment from Hunter Yelton.

She added that Hunter had repeatedly been warned by his teachers before being suspended for two days.

Hunter's mother, Jennifer Saunders, had insisted the punishment was too harsh.

'He is six years old, and that is absolutely ridiculous for him to have 'sexual harassment' on his record, even it is [only on the district's] record,' she said.

She explained the whole episode stemmed from an innocent crush Hunter had on a girl in the class.

He kissed her on the hand during reading group. That landed him a two-day suspension from school and an entry of sexual harassment in his school files.

But Ms Masters-Ownbey said the kissing had been 'over and over' and added that she hoped people would not 'start bashing the school that is doing a great job protecting my child from what is sexual harassment'.

'I've had to coach her about what to do when you don't want someone touching you, but they won't stop,' Masters-Ownbey said.

School officials had insisted that Hunter had been warned repeatedly and that the punishment was warranted.

Lincoln Elementary School Principal Tammy DeWolfe said the school would 'never suspend a student for one minor little violation'.

Ms Saunders admitted Hunter had problems at school before, getting suspended for rough-housing and for kissing the same girl on the cheek.

No criminal charges have been brought against the boy.

Ms Saunders told KRDO earlier that there was nothing unwanted about her son’s playful kiss.

‘She
was fine with it, they are 'boyfriend and girlfriend', she said. 'The 
other children saw it and went to the music teacher.'

But Ms Masters-Ownbey disagreed and said her son felt like he needed to protect his little sister when they were at school.

'In elementary school, when a boy kisses a girl, the usual response of their peers is 'ewww', she said.

'So
why do the other kids rush to tell? Because they've seen it over and 
over, they've seen him repeatedly get in trouble for it, they've seen 
the girl repeatedly tell him to stop, they know it's wrong.'

School policy: Hunter was suspended for breaking guidelines to prevent harassment

She
told the Canon City Daily Record originally two boys had been harassing
her daughter but when a teacher intervened the other child stopped. 

Mr
Gooldy, the superintendent of Canon City Schools, said that students 
aren't labeled sexual harassers after the first innocent grade-school 
kiss, but if unwelcome contact or touching continues, it will be noted 
in the student's file, he said.

He said the school system had to look at all sides of the story.

'Our
main interest in this is having the behavior stop because the story is 
not just about the student that was disciplined, it is also about the 
student receiving the unwanted advances,' he said.

Extreme response? Though Hunter admits to his wrongdoing, some adults, including a child psychologist, say the harsh steps taken by the school to punish him were in the extreme
