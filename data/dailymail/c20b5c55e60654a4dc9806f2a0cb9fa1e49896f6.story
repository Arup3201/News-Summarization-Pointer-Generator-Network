New York has today been hit by more than one inch of snowfall before Halloween for the first time ever - with experts predicting much more on the way.

A cold weather front is chugging up the East Coast of the U.S at an unusually early period and is expected to dump up to 10inches throughout the region.

More than 1.5 million homes have already lost power in the storm.

Some places in mid-Atlantic states  saw more than half a foot of snow and approximately 250,000 customers lost power in Pennsylvania and Maryland, requiring utility crews from Ohio and Kentucky to fix it.

More than 1,000 flights into or out of the United States were cancelled, with New York particularly affected. JFK airport had around 230 called off by 5pm local time.

Around 60 million people will experience the rare October snowstorm, which should unleash heavy, wet snow and wind, causing fallen tree branches and potential travel chaos.

This
weekend looks set to see huge amounts of sleet and snow covering the 
North East, invariably causing power outages and travel chaos. Some areas bracing for up to a foot of snow.

By 2pm, 1.3 inches of snow had fallen
in Central Park; never before in October has an inch of snow fallen on a 
given day in New York City, AccuWeather reported.

The website reported that 10 inches in Ogletown, Pennsylvania, 9.5 inches in Frostburg, Maryland, and 8.5 inches in Lost River, West Virginia.

New York has received measurable snow
before Halloween only three times since 1869 - and never more than one 
inch, as happened today.

The heaviest snow, though, is forecast for later in the day on Sunday in the Massachusetts Berkshires, the Litchfield Hills in northwestern Connecticut, southwestern New Hampshire and the southern Green Mountains.

'It's going to be wet, sticky and gloppy,' said NWS spokesman Chris Vaccaro. 'It's not going to be a dry, fluffy snow.'

The storm comes on a busy weekend for many along the Eastern Seaboard, with trick-or-treaters going door-to-door in search of Halloween booty, hunting season opening in some states and a full slate of college and pro football scheduled.

Fans in State College were making the most of what school officials said was the first measurable snowfall for any October home game since records began being kept in 1896.

The crowds were thinner, but 'the die-hards are here,' said T.J. Coursen of Centre Hall, an alumnus.

In Connecticut, Governor Dannel P. Malloy warned residents that they could lose power due to the anticipated wet, heavy snow.

The
heaviest snows are expected between 5pm and 8pm this evening, 
although the temperatures could bring light snow throughout the night.

The storm is expected to come hard and fast, with the heaviest snow set for the Virginia and West Virginia border through eastern Pennsylvania and southeastern New York state, northwestern New Jersey, northern Connecticut, Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire.

Naturally, areas of high altitude will be the most treacherous. Travel chaos is likely, with downed trees a very likely hazard and cars liable to skid on frozen roads.

In New England, where six inches of snow has already fallen, there is also expected to be powerful winds which could be very dangerous - bringing down trees and power lines.

Temperatures in the 30s and 40s and wind chills in the 20s will make it feel like winter has truly arrived.

Forecasters
at weather.com say the heaviest amounts of snow will fall in parts of 
Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey, upstate New York, Connecticut and 
Massachusetts.

These areas could see between two to four inches late on Saturday.

Weather.com
said: 'Precipitation will start as rain in these locations, but may 
change over to snow. How quickly this occurs and how much snow falls is 
dependent on the availability of enough cold air, which is difficult to 
forecast early in the season.'

The Northeast can expect what Denver already got. Colorado was hit with an unseasonably early snowstorm this week, sending some Occupy protesters to the hospital

Early season snows, when the leaves 
are still on the trees, are notorious for causing tree damage and power 
outages and this storm will be no exception.

The
biggest impact from the weekend’s storm will not come from snow 
accumulation, but from the rain and melted snow freezing on bridges and 
overpasses.

Sunday morning could be particularly treacherous on the roads.

Overnight freeze warnings are in effect across the north east region.

Lows in the 20s will effectively bring the agricultural growing season to an end, the Wall Street Journal reports.

Surface temperature is a factor in accumulations.

It's
been a warm October so far in much of the north east, so any falling 
wet snow that hits the pavement could melt soon after contact. If snow 
rates are heavy enough, then the warm ground obstacle to accumulations 
would be overcome.

Trick or treaters most likely will not be treading the white stuff on Monday.

The forecast for the country is 
mostly dry, though a few disturbances could bring some showers to parts 
of Pennsylvania and upstate New York.

Residents in the path of the unseasonable snow should watch out for power outages and falling tree limbs, still green from the late summer

National
Weather Service meteorologist Bill Simpson said you would won't need to
go out and buy roof rakes, but October snowfall records could be broken
in parts of southern New England, especially at higher elevations.

The October record for southern New England is 7.5 inches in Worcester in 1979, the Associated Press reports.

The most snow will likely hit the 
Massachusetts Berkshires, the Litchfield Hills in northwestern 
Connecticut, and south western New Hampshire, he said.

Connecticut Gov Dannel P. Malloy warned residents that they could lose power.

The storm could bring more than six inches of snow to parts of Maine beginning Saturday night.In
Pennsylvania, six to 10 inches could fall at higher elevations, 
including the Laurel Highlands in the south western part of the state 
and the Pocono Mountains in the north eastern part. Philadelphia and Pittsburgh could see a coating.

Not meant to be: Halloween decorations stand covered in snow in a front lawn in Denver, Colorado. A foot of snow fell this week, just two days after the city was 80 degrees

Initial blast: First snowfall in the tri-state area was in Vernon, Connecticut, on Thursday night

John LaCorte, a National Weather Service meteorologist in State College, Pennsylvania, said: 'This is very, very unusual. It has all the look and feel of a classic midwinter nor'easter. It's going to be very dangerous.'

The last major widespread snowstorm in Pennsylvania this early was in 1972, Mr LaCorte said.In New England, the first measurable snow usually falls in early December, and normal highs for late October are in the mid-50s.

'This is just wrong,' said Dee Lund 
of East Hampton, who was at a Glastonbury garage getting four new tires 
put on her car before a weekend road trip to New Hampshire.

Temperature plunge: The Saturday daytime figures show a biting 42-47 degrees as the storm clouds gather. Forecasters are predicting a 5pm start for the snow in much of the north east

Heading north: The temperatures ease up slightly Sunday daytime as the snow makes its way to northern New England

Drying out: Trick or treaters can look forward to a dry day for most of the country, with some showers in the north

Miss
Lund said that after last winter's record snowfall, which left a 
12-foot snow bank outside her house, she'd been hoping for a reprieve.

The good news, Mr Simpson said, is that relatively warm water temperatures along the Atlantic seaboard would keep the snowfall totals much lower along the coast and in cities such as Boston.

Temperatures should return to the mid-50s by midweek.

'This doesn't mean our winter is going to be terrible,' he said.

'We're Not Leaving': A snow-dusted protest sign sits under a tree at the Occupy Denver camp on Wednesday. Several protesters were taken to the hospital for hypothermia

'You can't get any correlation from a two-day event.'

Not everyone is lamenting the arrival of winter. Dan Patrylak, 79, of Glastonbury, had just moved back to New England from Arizona and was picking up two new ice scrapers for his car. He said he was looking forward to seeing snow on the ground again.

'In Phoenix, it's 113 all summer long,' he said. 'So, it just depends on where you are and what the weather is and you learn to accept that.  Whatever it is, I'm going to be ready for it.'
