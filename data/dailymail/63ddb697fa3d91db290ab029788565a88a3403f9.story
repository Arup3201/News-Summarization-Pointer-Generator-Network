Jamaican sprinter Asafa Powell clocked a time of 10.30secs to finish third in the 100m on his return to action in Lucerne.

Powell, a former world record holder, had his drugs ban reduced from 18 to six months, enabling him to compete again immediately.

Decent return: Asafa Powell looks pleased after returning to 100m action in Luzern, finishing third

Powell's compatriot Julian Forte won in Lucerne, with Antoine Adams of St Kitts and Nevis in second.

'It's good to be back,' Powell said. 'I've had a lot of stress and pressure over the last few months.

'I haven't trained for three weeks. I need to come back back bit by bit.'

The Commonwealth Games start in 
Glasgow a week on Wednesday and, although Powell's time will not force 
Jamaican selectors into making a difficult decision, the 31-year-old 
could still feasibly have been picked to represent his country once 
again.

Speed: Powell, who had his drugs ban reduced to six months, finished in a time of 10.30

Powell last ran competitively at the Lausanne Diamond League meeting in July 2013.

The Jamaican argued his offence was minor because the positive results came from a contaminated version of Epiphany D1, a legal supplement, that he was taking.

Powell testified back in January that his physical trainer Chris Xuereb provided him with nine supplements, including Epiphany D1. Xuereb denies the claims.
