The spa in London's Covent Garden is to close after almost 40 years of business

The luxury spa where Joan Collins once famously cavorted on a pool swing is to close after almost 40 years.

The Sanctuary, in London’s Covent Garden, was the setting for an orgy scene in the 1978 erotic movie The Stud, starring Miss Collins and based on the novel by her sister Jackie.

It is to shut because its owner is making more money from selling its branded lotions, oils and scrubs than from pampering the well-heeled.

The Sanctuary, a favourite among celebrities, was opened by US choreographer Gary Cockerill in 1977 as a present to his ballerina wife.

It welcomes around 60,000 guests a year, offering treatments ranging in price between £30 and £330.

But PZ Cussons, which now owns the spa, announced yesterday that it would be closing the flagship club to focus on selling its beauty products.

Its range has been praised by celebrities such as presenter Holly Willoughby and the ballerina and Strictly Come Dancing judge Darcey Bussell.

The announcement comes only six years after Cussons, the makers of Imperial Leather soap, bought the Sanctuary brand.

It follows the closure of its smaller day spas in Cambridge, Bristol and Richmond, West London.

The group, which had launched the smaller spas following its £75million Sanctuary takeover in 2008, had originally planned to retain the Covent Garden site.

But Cussons revealed yesterday that it will close on May 31 with the loss of some 100 jobs.

The spa is believed to have been hit by the trend for home pampering as consumers spend less on visits to day spas and instead choose to use DIY treatments at home.

That has seen sales of the Sanctuary range – promoted by Miss Bussell – perform well in the first half of the financial year.

It made £47.6million for the half-year to November 2013 – a 7.9 per cent rise in pre-tax profits – with earnings at its UK and European business up 8.1 per cent at £25.3million.

Overall the company saw ‘good progress’ across all four of its UK beauty brands, including St Tropez.

Sales of the fake tan lotion did particularly well after Cussons brought in Kate Moss to be the face of the brand.

Richard Harvey, chairman of Cussons, said its interim profits came despite a ‘significant’ currency hit from emerging markets.

The spa has been a favourite among London celebrities and socialites since its opening in 1977

It is being sold so the company may be able to focus more on its beauty products which have been highly successful

The group assured trading in the second half remained ‘pleasing’ in the face of the currency challenges.

Mr Harvey said: ‘Whilst the trading environment in most markets remains challenging, and in particular in Asia as a result of ongoing currency weakness, brand renovation and innovation continues to drive revenue and profit growth across the group.
