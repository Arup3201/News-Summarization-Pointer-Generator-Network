Horrifying CCTV footage has been released of a cell phone thief kicking a mother to the floor while she held her baby.

The 24-year-old woman was walking in the Bronx, New York, with her three-month-old child strapped to her chest when suspect Alonzo Brown ran up behind her and kicked her.

The victim, who hasn't been identified, fell onto the sidewalk while the 18-year-old thug picked up her phone and ran off.
