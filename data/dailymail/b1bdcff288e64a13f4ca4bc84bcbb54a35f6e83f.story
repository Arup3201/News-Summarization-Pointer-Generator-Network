The owner of an animal shelter which is caring for wildlife affected by South Australia's devastating bushfires has taken aim at Channel 7 breakfast show Sunrise, claiming producers got him to organise for volunteers to be on location for Tuesday's show - only for them to cancel without warning.

Mark Aldridge says he organised for volunteers and victims of the fires to be at his house from 5.30am for live crosses for a special broadcast but were left stunned when no one from Channel 7 showed up.

Executive producer Michael Pell and another senior Channel 7 staffer called Daily Mail Australia but refused to deny the claims on the record.

Mr Aldridge and his volunteers are caring for displaced and injured animals and taking food donations for them after fires destroyed large parts of the Adelaide Hills.  

Mr Aldridge, who runs Willow Wood Sanctuary in South Australia with his wife Helen, claimed Sunrise producers asked him to have ‘the donations on the lawn, all the rescuers there with the animals and those that lost their homes in the fires here for the cross overs’.

South Australians and rescued wildlife were ready at 5.30am for Sunrise to broadcast from Mark Aldridge's home

He said the show also requested ‘that we have the trucks arriving and departing, from 5.30 in the morning’ and he happily set about putting their requests into action.

But after visiting on Monday evening to ‘sort out where to set up the satellite’ and to ‘ask that we stack the donations on the lawn’, Sunrise workers then allegedly failed to turn up at Mr Aldridge’s sanctuary on Tuesday morning.

Mr Aldridge said Sunrise  producers later told him that they tried to contact him during Monday afternoon but he was out of phone range in the remote bushfire zone.

He raged on Facebook: ‘We have been doing rescues and feeding the animals and families devastated by the SA fires. 

'Some of us have missed days of sleep, but as Sunrise were going to help get the word out about the good work of the rescue groups, and in the hope that we would raise money for them, we all went out of our way.'

Bushfires have already burned more than 12,000 hectares of land north-east of Adelaide.

More than 375 firefighters from South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales are currently working on securing the 240-kilometre perimeter of the bushfire.

The blaze has destroyed or badly damaged 26 homes so far.

Mr Aldridge explained: ‘Now we have hours of work to get all the feed back under cover, and the rescuers have wasted time better spent doing what they do best........NOT EVEN A CALL SAYING THEY WERE NOT COMING.

'People devastated by the fires came all the way to be interview......what a**holes, in the world of mobile phones, they could have let us know last night, I will never watch that show ever again.'

After Mr Aldridge claimed he didn't receive a message or phone call from Sunrise and angrily shared his story on Facebook, thousands of community members commented in outrage.

Trish Butcher wrote on Sunrise's Facebook page: 'I think you have quite a few angry South Aussies. I think they have enough troubles without the no show, no communications this morning.'

Kathryn Clayton wrote: 'I think you have quite a few angry South Aussies. I think they have enough troubles without the no show, no communications this morning.'

Boxes of fresh vegetables that have been donated for the animals affected by the bushfires were piled up outside the sanctuary 

Mr Aldridge also organised crates of water to be on site by 5.30am

Anwyn Davies called for Sunrise to apologise on their Facebook page: 'Shame on you Sunrise, hang your head in shame.'

Channel 7 got in touch with Mr Aldridge on Tuesday morning and he then updated angry locals saying: ‘Channel 7 are not happy with my post, facts are simple I made the arrangements for their request to run the show from my Sanctuary, I did everything they asked and many people went out of their way to support the broadcast.‘

'7 have said they could not contact me in the late arvo, which was because I was in the fire zone and had no coverage.

‘I spoke to them one in that time and said everything would go as planned. They then could not contact me for a couple of hours so decided to go elsewhere, without telling me, I was home from 9 pm and in range from around 7.30.

‘They never sent a message or phoned me to say they weren't coming. So If they had messaged me saying they were not coming I did not receive it, and if that message was sent it was before 7.30 when I was out of range, I have never let 7 down and they have never let me down in the past, so I had no reason to believe they were not coming, if they did send the message I apologise, but I would have thought a call or confirmation would have been more appropriate.’

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Sunrise and Channel 7 for comment.
