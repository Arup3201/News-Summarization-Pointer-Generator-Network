A minister yesterday outraged train passengers by insisting that despite overcrowding, disruption and inflationary fare rises they are getting a ‘premium service’.

On the day rail travellers were hit with their tenth above-inflation annual fare price rise in as many years, transport minister Norman Baker insisted: ‘We’re not doing too bad.’

Rises have averaged nearly 4 per cent, but Mr Baker said fares were not overly expensive when off-peak tickets – and not just the most costly rush-hour ones – were taken into account.

Rail minister Norman Baker admitted the fares system is 'not ideal' but insisted tickets were not as expensive as some suggest

He even claimed that punctuality on 
Britain’s trains, which was recently shown to be far worse than thought,
‘was better than in Germany at the moment’.

A Transport Department spokesman later
admitted the minister had no figures to substantiate his claim – which 
had come from ‘an anecdote he heard at a conference last year’.

The controversy erupted as the New 
Year return to work got underway with commuters enduring ‘cattle class’ 
conditions and facing higher fares.

Regulated fares, which include season 
tickets, are increasing by up to 6.4 per cent for 2013, with an average 
rise across all tickets of 3.9 per cent.

On some routes, the price of a 
season ticket has now risen by more than 70 per cent in a decade.

The price rises follow the misery 
experienced by millions of passengers over Christmas and New Year.

The 
period was dominated by delays, disruption, over-running engineering 
works and pleas by rail bosses for passengers not to travel ‘unless 
absolutely necessary’.

Last night passengers and critics said
Mr Baker’s comments were ‘astonishing’ and accused the Lib Dem minister
and the Coalition of being ‘out of touch’.

Stephen Joseph, of the Campaign for 
Better Transport, said: ‘To suggest passengers are enjoying a premium 
service is  astonishing.

'Many commuters are enduring cattle class 
conditions on some of these lines and that is anything but a premium 
product – even for cattle.’

Bruce Williamson, of the campaign 
group Railfuture, said: ‘Enough is enough. They’re out of touch. Fares 
have risen with no perceptible improvement in service.

'Our fares are the
highest in Europe. But we don’t have the best rail service in Europe. 
Most people don’t choose to travel at peak times – they are forced to do
so to get to work on time.’

Mr Baker accepted the above-inflation 
rises were ‘not ideal’ and wanted to end them as soon as possible, but 
did not put a timescale on it.

He added: ‘You could argue people who 
are travelling in the rush hour are using the premium product and ought 
to pay something which reflects that.’

He also insisted that ‘given the 
stresses and strains we’re not doing too bad’.

His praise for the 
network is all the more extraordinary because his department has 
recently delivered damning statistics on lateness and overcrowding on 
trains.

Last month First Great Western’s 
7.44am Henley-on-Thames to Paddington service was named as the most 
overcrowded in England and Wales, with 80 per cent more passengers than 
it was built to carry in comfort. Other figures showed that the 
worst-performing train companies are running fewer than half their 
services on time.

UK passengers pay some of the most 
expensive fares in Europe. Based on rush-hour prices for those who do 
not pre-book, a British traveller can go an average of 133 miles for 
£100, against 188 miles in Norway for the same money, 312 in Spain and 
Germany, 365 in Wales and Scotland, 558 in France and 736 in Italy.

The policy of annual above-inflation 
fare rises is intended to switch more of the burden of paying for the 
railways away from the taxpayer and towards the fare-payer.

Mr Baker said: ‘We’ve inherited a 
policy from the last government – the only difference between us and 
them is that we’ve embarked on the biggest investment programme since 
the 19th century.’

He accepted that ‘walk-on fares’ – not
booked in advance – can be among the most expensive in Europe. But he 
argued: ‘Once you take the basket of fares, include early advance and 
off peaks, we are not nearly as expensive as is being presented.’

All rail fares go up by an average of 3.9 per cent today but some will increase by as much as 10 per cent
