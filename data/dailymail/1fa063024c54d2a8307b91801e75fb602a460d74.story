Ruled out: Les Dawson was nominated for an OBE twice, but never made the cut

He was one of the nation’s best-loved comics – but although Les Dawson was shortlisted twice for an OBE, he was snubbed both times.

Until now his closest family were unaware of the recommendations. And it seems Dawson’s relationship with a married woman may have been what gave the powers-that-be pause for thought.

Cabinet Office files requested by The Mail on Sunday show that the Blankety Blank host was recommended to receive the honour first in the Birthday Honours List of  1987 and then again in the New  Year Honours List of 1989.

The official records are partly redacted and do not explain why Dawson – famous for his gurning and mother-in-law jokes – was not honoured on either occasion.

But in 1987, the star’s colourful and very public love life produced  a string of lurid headlines that may have prompted politicians or civil servants to have second thoughts.

His popularity at the time was unquestionable. Dawson’s jokes were enjoyed by TV audiences of millions, and Prince Philip was one of his biggest fans.

He was also a tireless fundraiser, garnering more than £1 million for showbusiness and cancer charities.

Yet a Freedom of Information request by this newspaper has revealed that officials still turned him down.

In 1987, a year after losing his beloved first wife Margaret to cancer, the then father of three was hitting the headlines for all the wrong reasons.

He started to date barmaid Tracy Roper, who was not only 17 years  his junior but also married. A second woman then stepped forward  to publicly identify herself as another ‘secret lover’.

Tracy was to become Dawson’s second wife, but at the time, news of the relationship sparked a media frenzy.

Second wife: Les tied the knot in 1989 with Tracy Roper, a barmaid 17 years his junior who was initially married

Tracy’s then husband Richard accused Dawson of ‘stealing his wife’.

Dawson’s family last night said they had been unaware of the recommendations until contacted by The Mail on Sunday. Tracy, now 64, said: ‘I know he didn’t know anything about this and there was no question of him ever having turned it down.

‘He was always thrilled when other people were honoured and I think he would have adored it. To be honest I was amazed he didn’t get an honour and it may have been something he felt strongly about. But if he did, he never said anything about it.’

Tracy said she did not think the short-lived publicity about his private life should have ruled him out but she said it was difficult to ‘understand how these people think’.

‘He would 
have been absolutely thrilled even just to have been considered. He was 
very a humble man and never talked about awards'

His daughter Pamela by his first marriage said: ‘I wasn’t even aware Dad had even been in the running for this and I must admit it has brought a big smile to my face. He would have been absolutely thrilled even just to have been considered. He was very a humble man and never talked about awards.’

His personal politics were unlikely to have ruled him out from the honour because he was known as a supporter of the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.

Dawson’s curmudgeonly TV persona, which frequently saw him dressed in drag, belied the fact that he was a well-read intellectual and gifted pianist.

He had a lifelong passion for the English language and wrote 16 books. His personal library amounted to more than 4,000 books and Dawson loved the work of Anthony Trollope, persuading a friend, playwright Alan Plater, to adapt The Barchester Chronicles for the BBC.

Dawson married Tracy in 1989 and the couple had a daughter, Charlotte, before his untimely death at the age of 62 in 1993.

He was honoured with a memorial service at Westminster Abbey the following year and, 15 years after his death, a bronze statue was unveiled in his home town of Lytham St Annes in Lancashire.

A Cabinet Office spokesman  last night declined to provide further information about the recommendations.
