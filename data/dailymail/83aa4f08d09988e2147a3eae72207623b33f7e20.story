Victim: Lee David Clayworth said his teaching career is ruined after online harassment from an ex

A Canadian teacher has claimed that his career has been ruined because his ex-girlfriend refuses to stop posting naked pictures of him online and calling him a pedophile.

Lee David Clayworth, 35, from Vancouver, has been relentlessly cyber-stalked and harassed by Lee Ching Yan, whom he dated for several months while working as a teacher in Malaysia in 2010, he said.

He claims that after ending the relationship with Yan, she broke into his apartment, stole his laptop and uploaded naked pictures of him - which she had previously taken - to 'cheater' websites.

He has been applying for jobs since January and has received no positive responses - and he is certain it is because of the online posts and pictures.

Despite winning a defamation case against Yan, many of the sites are still active. They show pictures of a nude Clayworth beneath headings including 'child lover' and 'pedophile'.

'Would you want this man to teach your children?' another reads.

Yan also allegedly hacked into his email account 
and, posing as Clayworth, sent messages to his contacts 'revealing' how he had sex with underage students, CBC News reported.

The
harassment has been relentless - with her posting hundreds of comments 
on social networks such as Facebook, accusing him of vile, criminal 
acts, and claiming that he cheated on her.

'I did a Google search of my name and I 
saw profiles listed saying I am a psychopath, I am a child molester, a 
pedophile, I am involved with my students and so on,' he told CBC.

Harasser: He successfully sued his ex-girlfriend, Lee Ching Yan, for defamation but the posts remain online

Clayworth, who returned to Vancouver in January after his contract with the Malaysian school ended, said the treatment - and his struggle to remove posts from the web - has left him unable to get a job.

'I feel not only shut out of my own profession - but any job I apply for,' he said. 'It's a very, very dark place to be... and I am powerless.'

He believed there was some hope when a judge in Malaysia found Yan guilty of defamation and ordered her pay him the equivalent of $66,000 in damages in 2011.

Yet even this did not stop her, Clayworth said, as she left court and immediately began posting more pictures and comments.

The judge then ordered her to be jailed for contempt of court but she fled the country.

Relentless: Clayworth's name and picture appears on numerous websites such as 'liarscheatersrus.com'

No giving up: Even when a court found her guilty of defamation, Yan continued to post messages

In an unprecedented move, the court also told search engine 
providers Google, Yahoo and Bing to block Clayworth's name from search engines, but the companies have said this is impossible.

'Even if we did remove the name it would not make the content disappear 
from other places on the web, since Google’s search results are a 
reflection of the content and information that is available on the web,' Google spokesperson Wendy Bairos said. 'Users who 
want content removed from the internet should contact the webmaster of 
the page directly.'

Clayworth
said he has also gone done this avenue - getting mixed responses from 
webmasters - but even when the posts are taken down, Yan will just put 
them back up again.

He has even gone to Vancouver police, in the hope of getting an international arrest warrant for Yan.

Cruel: She uploaded naked photos of Clayworth and emailed his friends to say he'd had sex with students

But authorities said they are only able to get a Canada-wife warrant for the arrest - which is useless as Clayworth believes she is in Australia.

Det. Mark Fenton said he understood Clayworth's frustrations.

'The internet and society has moved at
such a fast pace, that government and law enforcement are unable to 
keep pace,' said Fenton. 'This is a huge mess... and it feels awful.'

For now Clayworth said he can merely continue to contact websites, search for jobs with good references from previous posts - and warn students against the memory of the internet.

'Everything that was digital and saved in my life - whether it was in the hard drive or laptop - is just at the disposal of this woman,' said Clayworth. 'It will never stop... it will go on and on.'

Clayworth, who lives in Canada, cannot get an arrest warrant for her as the case was won in Malaysia and she is now in Australia
