These 'inflated toys' may look like they're full of hot air, but they are in fact delicate, hand-crafted solid sculptures.

American artist Brett Kern, from Pennsylvania, has created a series of hyper-realistic ceramic models that look like inflatable toys.

His pieces are so realistic, many people don't realise they are solid pieces of art until they touch them.

Childhood memory: Kern's models are inspired by a dinosaur toy his mother gave him for good behaviour while his sister was born

Out of this world: Brett Kearn works as a teacher but makes his own pieces, such as this astronaut, pictured left, and hand, pictured right, in his spare time

Spot the difference: Most people believe the sculptures are inflatable toys until they touch them

Kern said his work is inspired by an inflatable dinosaur he was given by his mother for his good behaviour while his sister was being born.

Kern likens his mould-making process for his ceramic casts to the fossilization process.

He said the objects are 'covered in a material that captures their shape and texture and this, in turn, preserves the object as a rock-like representation'.

Fossils: Kern says he looks at his artwork as fossils that will preserve the 'cultural landscape' of his youth

Fart: It may look like a whoopee cushion filled with hot air, but its just another of Kern's creations

He adds: 'Movies, television, toys and games dominated the cultural landscape of my youth. I am a product of this specific time period, and I like to think of my artwork as the fossils that will help preserve it.'

While an inflatable toy may cost just a few dollars, one of Kern's artworks go for between $500 and $800.

His pieces include dinosaurs, rabbits and even astronauts.
