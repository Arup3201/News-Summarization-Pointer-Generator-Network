It seems you are never too young to enjoy a spa day.

At least, that's what the Baby Spa in Kensington, London, believes.

The unusual venue offers pampering for newborns, including luxury massages and even hydrotherapy treatments tailored just for them.

Laura Sevenus owns and operates the Baby Spa, where tots from as young as two days old have enjoyed her sessions, which include using floating rings to allow them to cool off in a swimming pool.

'Baby Spa creates a calm, soothing and fun experience for both the parent and baby,' Laura, a former South African competitive swimmer, explained.

'It's amazing to watch the intense pleasure, contentment and curiosity the babies of just a few days or weeks old show as soon as they float in the warm water.'

According to Laura, the most popular treatment is the use of Bubby floats that allow the tots to rest comfortably on the water's surface.

'The Bubby is a patented flotation device that fits loosely around a baby's neck, supporting an infant of any weight safely and comfortably in the water,' she said.

Babies as young as two days benefit from the hydrotherapy and its emphasis on developing range of motion

The flotation ring - called a Bubby - is fitted specifically to each baby to support their weight in the water

'Once the Bubby is fitted at the beginning of Baby Spa visits, the baby is placed in an individual neonatal pod or larger spa pool for up to 30 minutes of therapeutic immersion.'

The babies can then move around freely and have fun in the water, while also developing a larger range of movements.

She added: 'The comforting experience strengthens muscles and bone structure, whilst providing an environment where they can build confidence in the water.'

Not only is it fun, but hydrotherapy also helps to strengthen muscle and bone structure

The infants are absolutely enthralled by their water therapy, which can improve sleep quality and reduce colic

This hydrotherapy improves the infant's sleep quality and reduces discomfort from colic, wind, and constipation.

With regular visits, cardiovascular and respiratory systems also benefit.

Massages, where neonatal and paediatric nurses give comforting body rubs to the sound of soothing music, are also available. 

An avid swimmer, Laura also launched the Sevenus Swimming School in 2000 and hopes that early exposure to hydrotherapy will encourage an all-new generation of water lovers.

Spa treatments start at £60 for one hour.
