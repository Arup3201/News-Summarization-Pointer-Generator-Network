Text messages detailed in court documents have revealed the bitter custody battle that is still waging between Bristol Palin and her son's father, Levi Johnston.

The messages were shared with an Alaska court as 
Johnston tried to stop Palin traveling out the state, claiming he
 never gave his permission and demanding she stop doing 'whatever
 she wants'.

Johnston, now 24, and Palin, 23, had son Tripp as teens just after former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin missed out on her bid for the vice presidency. They split in 2009, when he was just months old.

Johnston has since married and has a one-year-old daughter named Breeze with his new wife, Sunny Oglesby - and in court documents, Johnston claims Tripp would much rather live with this family.

Battle: Bristol Palin and Levi Johnston are still fighting over custody of son Tripp, pictured together in 2010

'Go ahead and ask him if he want to stay 
with dad or go with u,' he said in the messages, shared by RadarOnline. 'Bet he says dad. Just saying 
Bristol. Tripps old enough to tell u what he wants now.'

The former couple had reached a child custody stipulation in August 2010, allowing Johnston to see his son on Saturdays and Wednesdays, but the court never approved it.

More recently, last October, Johnston opened a new custody case when Palin moved to Scottsdale, Arizona for a six-month training program - taking Tripp with her.

He served Palin with a temporary restraining order prohibiting her from taking Tripp out of the state again without the court's permission, Radar reported. She was already in Arizona, so he filed a motion for the immediate return of his son.

But her lawyers claim he was happy with the plans.

Together: Johnston has now married Sunny Oglesby, left, and has told Palin that their five-year-old son would rather stay with them. He also has a one-year-old daughter with Sunny

Hands on: Johnston, pictured with his kids, has admitted that he still owes Palin $30,000 in child support

'Levi had been informed of these plans 
and had not objected,' documents read. 'Bristol 
returned to Alaska for her school break in December and Levi had 
Christmas visitation with Tripp.'

But text 
messages in court documents show that Johnston was never happy about the
 move. In one, he responds to a text sent by Palin before they board the
 plane.

'When does my son get back?' Johnston responds. 'I told u … There is not chance you are taking him there for another 3 months. TRIPP wants and needs his father, Bristol...

'I no [sic] u trust our sons safe with me and is taken care of so I don’t understand why u don’t like him with his father If u only new the things he says to me and how happy he is with his dad and little sister. He really needs us both and I need him Bristol.'

Bristol responded, referring to his new wife.

'Look
 Levi, bfeore [sic] sunny got involved in this, you were fine with me 
being in school,' Palin replies. 'Tripp is enrolled in school in AZ and 
will be back when I’m done with training.'

With mom: Tripp is pictured with his mother, who recently took her to Arizona - which angered Johnston

Having fun: Johnston called Palin, pictured with Tripp, 'selfish' and said she just did what suited her

He responds: 'How can u be so selfish and no I was never EVER ok with u taking my son anywhere or put on your TV show. It’s all crap. He deserves more then [sic] that.

'He needs his dad and my family just as much as yours. And more importantly. Tripp needs stability and a routine and sports. And all that. I really hope and pray u put 2 and 2 together one day. It’s not right. Or fair to our son.'

She and Tripp have now returned to Alaska.

Palin has previously claimed that Johnston owes her $66,8080.57 in child support, but Johnston says it's $30,000 less than that.

A judge had previously denied Johnston's petition for equal custody in October, but a new judge will now take over and the first hearing will take place in July.

Bristol and
 Johnston's son Tripp Easton Mitchell Johnston was born in December 
2008, but the two broke off their engagement the following March.

Not happy: Former Alaska governor Sarah Palin, pictured in March, had asked the couple to keep the child secret when she was running for vice president in 2008, according to Johnston

After their break-up, Johnston became outspoken against the Palin family, saying in a September 2009 Vanity Fair article that Sarah initially wanted to keep Bristol's pregnancy a secret.

Johnston said Sarah offered to adopt and raise their child as her own, but that they declined.

In response, Sarah issued a statement saying Johnston's statements were 'untrue, malicious, and appalling'.

The young couple briefly reunited in July 2010, with Johnston issuing a public apology to the Palin family for statements he made that 'were not completely' true.

But the couple broke off their second engagement just three weeks later, and Johnston said he regretted making the public apology to the Palin family.

He said the statement 'kind of makes me sound like a liar. I've never lied about anything'.
