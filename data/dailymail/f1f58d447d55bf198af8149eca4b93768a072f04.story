A world league table today revealed the countries which view the most pornography.

The global leaders in porn are the U.S, taking a 60 per cent share of global internet pornography,

Two thirds of all U.S porn sites are 
hosted in California with the country hosting a total of 4.2 million 
domains containing porn.

Meanwhile,
 the famously liberal Netherlands host over a quarter of the porn, with 
1.8 million domains carrying an astonishing 187 million pages of porn.

The UK hosts 52 million pages of porn, behind only the U.S and Holland. The global leaders in porn are the U.S, taking a 60 per cent share of global internet pornography. Meanwhile, the Netherlands hosts over a quarter of the world's porn

The UK is home to 512,000 domains hosting 52 million pages of porn.

Germany follows behind at fourth with a 1.16 per cent share accounting for 8 million pages of porn spread over 80,000 domains.

While Germany has more than double the UK’s web hosting capacity, the UK has more than six times the amount of porn pages.

Overall, the UK is thought to be the 9th most connected country in the world in terms of the number of internet users.

The figures have led John Carr, a government adviser on child internet safety, to call for restrictions on registering pornographic websites on Britain’s national domain.

'My beef has always been about the ease with which children can be exposed to it or can access it,' said Mr Carr, writing in his blog.

‘Thus, If the Germans can insist that hard core porn publishers on their territory must tie the supply of such content to an age verification process, couldn’t we try something similar?’ 

The data was compiled by California-based filtering company MetaCert between December 2011 to August 2013 using what it claims to be ‘the world’s most sophisticated crawlers and content classification platform’.

The group said it hopes to use the data to provide better internet safety products across tablets and smartphones.
