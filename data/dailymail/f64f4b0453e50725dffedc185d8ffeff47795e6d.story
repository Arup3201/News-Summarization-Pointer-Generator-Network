Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has warned his injured and suspended players they face a fight to automatically win their place back.

United beat Everton 2-1 before the international break without 10 players including Michael Carrick, Phil Jones and Wayne Rooney.

Some of them are available to return against West Brom on Monday night, though Rooney is still serving a three-match ban, but van Gaal is offering no guarantees.

Louis van Gaal says Manchester United's injured stars aren't guaranteed to win their places back 

Wayne Rooney (left, next to Ashley Young) was missing for United before the international break 

'Nobody is walking back in my team, believe me,' said the Dutchman. 'You have to earn it on the training ground and every player knows that.

'I have always said it's not automatically players with the biggest names who are the best. I am looking for a consistent level.'

Van Gaal may be forced to make some changes with youngster Paddy McNair and Antonio Valencia receiving fresh knocks.

On the positive side defenders Chris Smalling and Jones have been training again with midfielders Ashley Young, Michael Carrick and Ander Herrera.

Van Gaal said: 'I've got great respect and confidence in the players I have used this season. Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick and Phil Jones are great football players but we have other great players too, believe me sometimes the other players are doing better.

Phil Jones and Michael Carrick are both back in contention for Van Gaal's side away at West Brom on Monday

Youngster Paddy McNair has impressed at the heart of United's defence in the absence of others

'McNair was outstanding in his first match and you saw the reaction of the fans, they applauded every time he touched the ball.

'He was fantastic in the games he played when Jones, Evans and Smalling were not available. Everyone has to earn their position.'

Van Gaal's words will be a comfort to youngsters Tyler Blackett and Luke Shaw who have played recently due to injuries.

Despite United being linked with centre-halves in the January transfer window with Aston Villa's Dutchman Ron Vlaar available at £12million, Van Gaal has played down the need for new blood, saying that when players return from the treatment table he will have the optimum 26 players he likes to train with.
