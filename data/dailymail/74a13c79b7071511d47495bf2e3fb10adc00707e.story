What do you do when you only have one award and you have to choose between Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi? You invent another award of course.

Ronaldo scooped Most Valuable Player at the Spanish League awards while Messi won the Best Player gong and the Best Forward prize over his Real rival.

The new prize at least made sure that Ronaldo turned up and he posed for photographs with the other winners who included Everton's on-loan striker Gerard Deulofeu who won the Best Player category in last season's Second Division and Chelsea's goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois who picked up the Best Goalkeeper award on-loan at Atletico Madrid.

Ronaldo said: 'This award is thanks to my team-mates. Hopefully things continue going well and I win many more.'

Other winners included Ronaldo's Real team-mates Sergio Ramos (Best Defender) and Asier Illarramendi (Best Midfielder and Surprise Player), as Andre Iniesta (Best Attacking Midfielder) and Atletico Madrid's Diego Simeone beat Tito Vilanova and Jose Mourinho to the Best Coach prize.

Ronaldo, meanwhile, said he has recovered from a muscle strain which ruled him out of Real Madrid's past two games.

'I no longer have an injury,' Ronaldo said at the awards ceremony in Madrid.

'I have been fine for a couple of days,' added the 28-year-old, who has been in scintillating form this season.

'We preferred not to push things against Valladolid but I will be there for the next game for sure.'

Asier Allarramendi picked up two awards at Monday night's ceremony. But who is the rising star who left Real Sociedad for Madrid in the summer? Sportsmail's Pete Jenson gives his verdict:

'Eyebrows were raised when Real Madrid paid Â£32million at the start of the season for Real Sociedad midfielder Asier Illaramendi.

'For once the club were buying for the future and purchasing a player who was not the finished product.

'The plan is that the under-21 European Champion will one day replace Xabi Alonso but coach Carlo Ancelotti is not convinced the transition can be made this season ...'

Ronaldo
 netted 14 goals in his last seven appearances for club and country 
before his injury and is one of the favourites to scoop the FIFA Ballon 
d'Or when the Footballer of the Year award is announced next month.

The
 former Manchester United star was the last player to win in 2008 before 
Barcelona's Argentine forward Messi took the next four.

'I
 am on good form,' Ronaldo said. 'It's possible that it is the best 
start to the season of my career but the past few years have also been 
very good.'

Although Ronaldo and his Real team-mates were out in full force on the red carpet for the glitzy Madrid ceremony, Lionel Messi was putting the hours into his training regime in Argentina, where he is battling to be fit again for the rest of Barcelona's title defence.
