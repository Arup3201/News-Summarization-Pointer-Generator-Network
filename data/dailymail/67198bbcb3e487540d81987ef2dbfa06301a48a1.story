She has sung for the Queen and now, a year after her shattering split from her former fiancé, Welsh songbird Katherine Jenkins’s heart is being repaired — by a close friend of Prince Harry.

Despite the classical singer being linked with a string of eligible bachelors over the past year, strapping rugby-playing Adam Bidwell is the first man she has stepped out with since she parted from TV presenter Gethin Jones.

At the time, Katherine, 32, said she was ‘beyond broken-hearted’. But that is now all in the past.

The first man Welsh songbird Katherine Jenkins has stepped out with since her split from Gethin Jones is Prince Harry's friend Adam Bidwell

She and Cambridge-educated Adam met through mutual friends in London a few weeks ago and are already said to be smitten.

‘This is the first guy since Gethin who Katherine has gone out with, so she is taking it slow,’ says a friend. ‘They obviously share a mutual love of rugby, as Adam used to play for London Wasps and she’s the Welsh team’s mascot and has sung at lots of games. She is really excited to see where it leads.’

Brighton-born Bidwell, 37, a sales manager for financial firm Investec, is a favoured member of Prince Harry’s entourage. He was famously photographed with the Prince in a Jacuzzi during Harry’s wild trip to Las Vegas last year.

‘Katherine knows Adam likes to have fun and all about his party past, but they have lots of other things in common like food, travel and music,’ says the friend.
