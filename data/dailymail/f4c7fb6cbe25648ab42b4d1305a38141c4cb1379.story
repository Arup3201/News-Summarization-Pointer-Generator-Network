A stunned shopper has ridiculed troubled supermarket Tesco after being told she needed ID to buy fruit because it could ferment and turn into alcohol.

Kate Lancaster, 37, from Plymouth, was trying to buy a packet of melon and grapes at the self-service checkout of a Tesco Metro  when a warning appeared saying the product was age restricted.

She left the store when no staff member came to help, and when she contacted Tesco to complain she was told the fruit was age restricted because it can be turned into alcohol.

Kate Lancaster, 37, from Plymouth, was asked for ID while buying a pack of melon and grapes from a self-service till in a Tesco store, and was later told this was because it could ferment and turn into alcohol

In an email she was also told that all Tesco fruit could soon become age restricted in case natural fermentation occurred.

Ms Lancaster said she couldn't believe the response, adding that it was 'crazy' and went against health advice to get children to eat more fruit.

Ms Lancaster, who works in Plymouth University library, said: 'It just seemed like a bizarre reason. When I got the response from Tesco I told my friend at work and we fell about laughing. 

'It’s just ridiculous, you couldn’t make it up. They would be doing the exact opposite to what is recommended, they promote healthy eating in kids.'

Government health advice suggests eating five portions of fruit and vegetables every day, but some experts want this upped to seven after a study by University College London.

Their research showed that eating more fruit and vegetables cuts the risk of premature death by 42 per cent, cutting risk of cancer by a quarter and heart-related deaths by a third.

The study also showed that canned or frozen fruit and veg is not as healthy as frozen, and raised questions about the benefits of juice, which currently counts towards the five-a-day total. 

Ms Lancaster said she 'fell about laughing' after reading the letter, which added that all fruit could soon be age restricted. Tesco have since clarified that this is not company policy (file image)

In order to ferment fruit into alcohol it usually has to be chopped or mashed into a pulp, then mixed with water and yeast and allowed to stand for just over a week.

This will produce a weak alcoholic mixture, and will either need to be fermented further to produce wine, or distilled in order to produce a hard spirit. 

A Tesco spokesman said: 'Our customer service colleague’s comment about natural fermentation was meant as a joke – we’re sorry if it was taken literally. 

'Of course we have no plans to age restrict fruit sales. Our team have apologised for any confusion and are sending Mrs Lancaster a fruit basket as a gesture of goodwill.'

The spokesman added that it was not immediately clear why an alarm on the till had gone off, but said the store does not think it was related to ID.
