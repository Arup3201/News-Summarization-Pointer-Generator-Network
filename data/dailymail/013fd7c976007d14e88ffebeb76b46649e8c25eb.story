Jessica Ennis-Hill will make her long-awaited competitive return in the 100m hurdles at the Great CityGames in Manchester on May 9.

The Olympic heptathlon champion will take part in her strongest event after a near two-year absence from competition due to the birth of son Reggie last summer.

Ennis-Hill did set a British record of 12.54 seconds for the 100m hurdles at London 2012 and although that has since been broken by Tiffany Porter, a run in her favoured event should prove a good guide for her readiness for a heptathlon return in Gotzis at the end of May.

'I'm really looking forward to making my competitive return at the Great CityGames Manchester. The atmosphere is always amazing there,' said Ennis-Hill.

'Street athletics is a lot of fun, not only you are really close to the fans, but the energy around the Morrison's Great Manchester Run weekend is fantastic, as the elite races and the mass participation run bring the city together in a celebration of running.'
