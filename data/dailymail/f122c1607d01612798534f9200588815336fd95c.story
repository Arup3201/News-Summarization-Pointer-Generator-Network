New uncovered photos reveal a smiling former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez as he  parties with friends just days after he's accused to gunning down two men in Boston.

The 24-year-old now faces charges he pulled the trigger in the chilling July 2012 double homicide, but photos snapped days later in posh Newport, Rhode Island do not show a man riddled with guilt for his alleged crimes.

Instead, the fallen football star is seen beaming as he gladly posed for pictures with employees at a shop where he rented scooters and jet skis during a weeklong seaside holiday.

Chilling: Hernandez partied with friends in Newport while showing no obvious signs of regret. However, according to witnesses, he and his group were 'acting weird, laughing and goofing around then punching each other in the face'

More charges: Aaron Hernandez has been charged with two additional counts of first-degree murder in connection with a 2012 double murder in Boston

While he appears to be having a good time, witnesses say his behavior while on holiday wasn't completely normal.

A source told MyFoxBoston that the former tight end and his group were 'acting weird, laughing and goofing around then punching each other in the face.'

Hernandez has been linked to a total 
of three killings and is already being held without bail after pleading 
not guilty to murder in the death of 27-year-old Odin Lloyd last year.

In the 2012 case, victims Daniel Abreu, 29, and Safiro Furtado, 28, were shot as they sat in a car in the city's South End.

A grand jury moved forward Friday morning with the indictment for the July 16, 2012 killing of the the lifelong friends shot to death as they sat waiting at a red light.

Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley said during a Friday morning press conference that he expects the former Patriot to be arraigned on the additional murder charges early next week.

Investigators believe that Hernandez was driving the SUV used in the shooting and likely fired the shots that killed Abreu and Furtado.

Hernandez is seen in surveillance footage with friend Alexander Bradley entering the nightclub Cure at about 12.30 a.m. on July 16, 2012 and quickly guzzling two drinks, according to an affidavit cited by WCVB. Abreu and Furtado entered just before him.

He and Bradley leave after about 10 minutes and exit a nearby parking garage in a Toyota 4Runner, the affidavit says. Abreu and Furtado leave the club at about 2.10 a.m.

Hernandez's SUV is seen driving slowly past the two men twice as they walked to the parking garage, the document says. He is believed to have followed them down Shawmut Avenue to the light where they were eventually shot to death.

'Aaron Hernandez fired a .38-caliber revolver multiple times from the driver’s side of his vehicle in to the passenger side of the other vehicle,' Conley explained, adding the victims were 'stalked and ambushed in the city they call home.'

Both men were shot multiple times - Abreu died from a bullet to the chest, Furtado was killed by a shot to the head.

The six shots fired from the SUV with Rhode Island plates, according to witnesses, were not caught on camera.

A third person was wounded in the attack but survived, according to reports.That person is said to be key to the prosecution's case and may even testify in court.

'Things happened so fast,' the passenger told Fox 25. 'I was trying to defend myself. They were shooting everywhere inside the car, front to back. They just came to kill. That's it.'

The witness said he recognized Hernandez's face after he was arrested last year for Lloyd's death.

Investigators initially believed the drive-by shooting was gang-related, sources told the Boston Globe.

Initial reports suggested Abreu and Furtado were gang members, but Conley made it clear that they were not. Aldo quashed were rumors they knew Hernandez prior to the night they were killed.

'These men were ambushed and executed as they drove home,' said Conley. 'Neither of [the victims] were involved in gangs, guns or violence of any kind.

'Their chance encounter inside a club triggered a series of events that culminated in these murders.'

Neither had a criminal record, they both worked for a cleaning company, family told Fox 25.

The case 
remained unsolved until recently, but they believe evidence links 
Hernandez to those murders after they observed him on nearby surveillance footage and a nightclub bouncer contacted police saying he had knowledge that the two incidents... were related,' according to the Boston Herald.

Last year, Abreu's sister lamented the lack of leads in the investigation to WBZ.

Victim: Odin Llloyd was shot dead in June last year

'It’s really frustrating, I think about it a lot and I cry. The only thing I can do is pray to God,' said Neusa Abreu.

'I don’t know if [Hernandez] was abused as a child or had a rough life. I’m not sure what the issue is and why this had to happen,' she added.

Investigators' focus shifted towards the former All-Pro after he was linked to the murder of Odin Lloyd.

It is believed Hernandez may have killed Lloyd because he was concerned the semi-pro football player was talking about the double murders, law enforcement sources have said.

Investigators told the Globe that they believe Hernandez enlisted the help of two childhood friends from Bristol, Connecticut, to help kill Lloyd in an effort to keep word of the star player's involvement in the other two murders from spreading.

Friday morning's indictment brings full circle investigators' suspicions Hernandez was involved in the two deaths, whispers first made public earlier this year when court documents in the Lloyd case were unsealed.

'There is ... probable cause to believe that Aaron Hernandez was operating the suspect vehicle used in the shooting homicides ... and may have been the shooter,' a 2013 warrant made public by WCVB reads.

Investigators have since located the handgun used to kill both men and the silver Toyota Hernandez was driving the night they were killed.

The SUV was discovered in the garage of a Bristol home owned by one of Hernandez's uncles.

The double murder occurred only one week before the start of the Patriots training camp for the 2012-2013 season.

Hernandez played in 10 games that season, scoring five touchdowns while catching 51 passes for 483 yards, raising the possibility that he played after shooting two people dead.

His contract with the team was terminated after he was arrested at his home in suburban North Attleboro in June 2013 on live television.

Ernest Hernandez, believed to be one of Hernandez's accomplices in the murder of Lloyd, is expected to be arraigned for the murder Friday afternoon.

Carlos Ortiz will be arraigned May 27 on murder charges for Lloyd's death, the Globe reported.

Lloyd's body was discovered by a runner in an industrial park not far from Hernandez's home. It is believed by prosecutors that Hernandez and his accomplices drove Lloyd to the park and killed him.

Hernandez's legal team has not made any comments on the additional charges.

He is being held in Bristol County Jail without bail.
