Whales are capable of swimming vast distances across oceans, but they are also expert divers.

And now a study has revealed that the shy Cuvier’s beaked whale performs the deepest dives made by any mammal on the planet.

Scientists were surprised to record one of the mammal's dives, which was 9,816ft (2,992 metres) below the waves.

A study has revealed that the shy Cuvier's beaked whale performs the deepest dives made by any mammal on the planet at 9,816ft (2,992metres) below the waves - the equivalent of just under seven Empire State Buildings - and stays below for 138 minutes

And the whale stayed up to two miles below - around the depth of just under seven Empire State Buildings on top of one another - for 138 minutes.

The New York landmark measures 1,250ft (381 metres) in height, excluding its tip.

It is the first time that the diving behaviour of the species has been carefully examined and scientists are particularly interested in them because of the suspected effects of sonar - a system using transmitted and reflected underwater sound waves to detect and locate submerged objects.

Marine mammal biologists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, tagged eight of the whales off San Nicholas Island in southern California and followed them for several months as they dived for food.

Individual Cuvier’s beaked whales have beached in the Mediterranean and around the Canary Islands and the Bahamas, National Geographic reported.

It is thought they did this because of sonar activity from ships, but none of the species have beached in southern California – the site of a Navy sonar testing area – close to where the study took place, according to Greg Schorr, a research biologist with the Cascadia Research Collective in Olympia, Washington.

Studying Cuvier’s beaked whales is incredibly difficult as they spend a lot of their time in deep waters far away from the shore.

Beaked whales also rarely approach boats, according to Randall Davis, a marine mammal biologist at Texas A&M University in Galveston who was not involved in the study.

Some species are only known from specimens that have died and washed up on shore, Dr Schorr said in the study, which is published in the journal Plos One.

Recent research is only just giving scientists a good idea of how the whales spend their time and the experts admitted they did not expect to see any of the creatures dive almost 10,000ft (3,000 metres).

Dr Schorr was so shocked that he initially checked that the tag had not malfunctioned, by placing an identical one in a pressure chamber to check it could withstand comparable depths.

Dr Davis described the deepest dive as ‘spectacular’ and hypothesised that such efforts must be worth it for the animals to keep on diving.

He presumes they are rewarded by finding food such as deep-sea squid, but diving so deep can cause lungs to collapse and can even trigger convulsions.

It is thought that Cuvier’s beaked whales get around these problems because they have rib cages that can fold down so there is less air in the lungs.

But scientists are unsure how they manage to avoid high-pressure nervous syndrome, which causes convulsions.

The team of experts hope that their research might help solve this mystery in years to come but are currently focused on whether the whales display unusual behaviour when they hear sonar.
