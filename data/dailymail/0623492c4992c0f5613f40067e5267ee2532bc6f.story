When Amer Deghayes graduated from a college in Brighton with a qualification in business studies  this summer, he had his whole future ahead of him.

Rather than start a career, he chose to follow in his father's footsteps and travel to Syria in order to had out aid to the needy.

But once inside the country he quickly joined forces with the al-Nusra Front, and al-Queda linked group fighting against the regime of Bashar al-Assad.

Amer Deghayes (centre, in grey) was the first of his family to leave for Syria, telling his parents he wanted to be an aid worker. Brother Abdullah (front left) and Jaffar (front right) followed soon after

Worse still, his brothers Abdullah, then 18 and due to start a University course in his home-town, and Jaffar, 17, followed after him. 

Their mother, Einas Abulsayen, said that the two younger boys left without warning, after the youngest tricked her into thinking he needed his passport for ID at school. 

She said just before leaving Jaffar asked her for a cuddle. She didn't realise she was holding her son for what could prove to be the last time.

On the way to the airport, the boys met up with long-term family friend Ibrahim Kamara, 19, who had stolen his 15-year-old brother's passport before going to join them.

Despite being unaccompanied by an adult, all three are believed to have caught a flight from Luton airport to Turkey, where they found their way into Syria. 

Abubaker Deghayes went to see his three sons several times in the next few months in several unsuccessful attempts to persuade them to come home.

He insists that during this time he believed the boys were still working for aid charities, but in April, he came face to face with the truth.

While Amer had once been an intelligent college student, earning a qualification in business studies, once in Syria he joined the al-Nusra Front, an al-Queda affiliated group fighting Bashar al-Assad

Amer's father travelled  to see his sons, who refused to come home and insisted they were working with aid charities. But in April he learned the truth when Amer called to say Abdullah had been killed by a Syrian sniper

His eldest son Amer, called to say his younger brother Abdullah had been killed by a Syrian army sniper in Kassab.

Mr Deghayes said: 'Amer told me Abdullah advanced into territory of the Syrian army then a sniper shot him in the chest. He fell on the ground and looked at the sky and laughed.

'You feel he died a good death as a Muslim. As a martyr, he goes to paradise. But at the same time you feel sad for the loss.' 

Then, last week, Mrs Kamara also got a call from Amer. Over Skype he explained that Ibrahim had also been killed, this time by one of the first U.S. airstrikes in Syria after his compound was hit.

The three brothers were joined by another Brighton student, Ibrahim Kamara, 19, who stole his 15-year-old brother's passport before flying from Luton airport to fight in Syria

His mother Kadiatu Kamara (pictured) also recieved a call from Amer last week to say her son had been killed in one of the first U.S. airstrikes in Syria, which hit a compound he was in

He explained that Ibrahim, who  was the going by the name of Khalil al-Britani, had recorded a message on his phone for his family in case he died, but the phone had been destroyed.

With airstrikes intensifying, and fighting in Syria growing fiercer by the day, the Deghayes family fear they will never see their remaining two sons again.

In part, they blame British authorities for telling teenage jihadis that they will face prosecution if they return to the UK. Mr Deghayes believes there should be an amnesty to allow his boys to come home. 

Both parents insist that their sons are not 'terrorists', merely selfless boys who travelled to Syria to 'help defend those who are weak.'

Around 400 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria over the last two years, authorities believe, with an estimated 20 having died.

The Deghayes' parents insist their boys are not terrorists, and simply went to Syria to protect the weak. They now fear they will never see their two remaining sons again

Those who have died include Abdul Waheed Majeed, 41, who is believed to have driven a lorry to a jail in Aleppo before detonating a bomb in February.

The married father of three, who was born and raised in Crawley, West Sussex, left Britain in 2013, telling his family he was going on a humanitarian mission to Syria.

Photographs were also published in January of two British brothers, named in reports as Akra and Mohamed Sebah from north London, who were believed to have died in battle in the war-torn country in September.
