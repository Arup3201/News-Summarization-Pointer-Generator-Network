A St. Patrick's day segment on a Chicago morning news station was turned upside down last week when a woman took a power tool to her crotch live on air. 

In a video of the segment aired on WGN-TV March 13, the host himself seems to have no clue what is about to unfold as he introduces Shana Vaughan-Gabor, a dancer with Cirque De La Femme -- a Chicago burlesque troupe.

'[Shana] explained to me what exactly she's going to do,' the host says.

'I'm not entirely sure what it is but I know it involves a power tool.'

Within seconds, sparks are seen flying as Vaughan-Gabor stands en pointe and takes a power saw to a small, metal box that is fastened to her pelvic area.

As musicians and children look on in the background, a WGN anchor is heard saying 'What? Oh no, stop! What is going on?'

Vaughan-Gabor then climbs onto a chair and, upside down, she spreads her legs and continues to use the power saw.

'I've been waiting my whole life to meet a woman like this,' the host says.

Soon the camera briefly cuts to sports coverage before showing the host surrounded by a group of children in green St. Patrick's Day shirts. 

'What did you guys think of the lady shooting sparks out of her midsection?' the host asked the children.

The kids yelled 'mind blowing,' 'creepy,' and 'stinky.'

Shortly after the segment aired, WGN news anchor Larry Potash took to Twitter to apologize on behalf of the station for, what he called, the 'unintentional porn.' 

Vaughan-Gabor uploaded a photograph of her shocking performance to her Instagram account noting that the station cut to hockey during her performance and urged the station to 'Save the children from boring!'
