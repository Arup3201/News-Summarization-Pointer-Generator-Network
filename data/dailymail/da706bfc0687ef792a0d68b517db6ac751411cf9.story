When Helen Williams settled into the sauna at her local leisure centre for her  weekly session,  she was hoping it would help her relax.

Instead, she found herself  getting all steamed up – over an influx of nudists.

An astonished Mrs Williams, 54, watched in bewilderment as she was surrounded by naked men and women from a naturist club.

Furious: Norman Williams, and his wife Helen, whose session in the sauna at Chepstow Leisure Centre was interrupted by a group of 40 local nudists

First, two naked bathers climbed into the sauna alongside her. Then, when she headed to the changing room to get away from them, she found yet more in there.

Bosses at the council-run leisure centre have now apologised after admitting the nudists should not have been able to mix with regular customers.

Mrs Williams’ husband Norman, 70, said: ‘She went in as normal to the gym and swimming pool for her regularly weekly session.

‘She was then in the sauna when men and women came in with no clothes on at all.

‘They were all in the swimming pool as well. Helen went into the changing room to get away but there were naked men and women in there as well.

‘She changed quickly and came home. I was furious – what if there were children about?’

Mr Williams phoned the leisure centre in Chepstow, South Wales, to complain and was told his wife had accidentally witnessed a regular meeting of 40 local naturists.

Leisure centre spokesman Ian Saunders said: ‘We have two sauna areas, one downstairs and one upstairs. The naturist group privately hire the swimming pool each Friday evening and use the upstairs sauna area to change.

Astonished: A spokesman for the council-run sauna in Chepstow, South Wales, said that the group had privately hired the sauna where Mrs Williams 'unfortunately' found herself

‘Unfortunately a lady booked a sauna and found herself in the upper sauna area.

‘Usually our staff clear the public from the areas used by the naturist group.

‘We are naturally very disappointed that on this occasion the lady concerned was left in the sauna as the group entered.

‘This is the first problem we have encountered in 25 years that the club has hired the pool. We have apologised to the lady concerned and wish to assure the public that we will look into this incident.’

But Mr Williams added: ‘My wife didn’t know whether it was a culture thing. It’s a place for public use. We’re not going there again.’

Mrs Williams is originally from China, and married her husband, who she met through friends, in the city of Xi’an in 2008.

Many sports facilities in Britain hold naturist swimming sessions – with the World Naturist Swimming Championships taking place at a Rugby leisure centre in 2009.
