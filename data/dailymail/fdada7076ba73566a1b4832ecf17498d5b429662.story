There are centuries of stunning and informative maps locked away in books, magazines and cupboards gathering dust - and Google wants to change that.

The Californian firm has launched its Maps Gallery specifically designed to let governments, businesses, charities and other cartographers make their wealth of mapping history available to everyone.

Among the maps already featured include a collection from National Geographic, satellite-based maps from Nasa, and maps from the World Bank Group and the United States Geological Survey.

They showcase the changing landscape of 
Tokyo since the 17th century, how the battles of the American civil war 
were won and lost, a physical map of the Arctic Ocean floor and biblical
 landmarks of the Middle East.

Google's Maps Gallery works like an interactive, digital atlas where anyone can search for and find maps. Collections can be seen on Google Earth and they feature historic city plans, deforestation changes and battles, including this map of the American Civil War. It plots the major land campaigns, Union and Confederate troop movements, major Union naval campaigns, roads, railroads, dates of capture by Union forces and more

Jordan Breckenridge, Google Maps product manager launched the Maps Gallery in blog post last week.

He said: 'Governments, nonprofits and businesses have some of the most valuable mapping data in the world, but it’s often locked away and not accessible to the public.

‘With the goal of making this information more readily available to the world, today we’re launching Google Maps Gallery, a new way for organisations to share and publish their maps online via Google Maps Engine.'

All the maps included in the Gallery 
can be seen on Google Earth and they cover topics such as locations of 
municipal construction projects, historic city plans, population 
statistics, deforestation changes and up-to-date emergency evacuation 
routes.

The National 
Geographic maps have their own section within the Gallery and feature wall maps,
 reference maps, as well as other maps especially created by 
National Geographic for its magazine or supplements.

Nasa's animation of Earth's city lights was created using data from the Suomi NPP satellite over nine days in April 2012 and 13 days in October 2012. It took 312 orbits to get a clear shot of every part of Earth's land surface and islands. This data was then mapped over existing Blue Marble imagery of Earth to provide a realistic view of the planet

This map of the world was published by National Geographic in 1970. Users can type in the location they want to view and Google will jump to that country or city

The National Geographic maps have their own section within the Gallery and feature wall maps, reference maps, as well as other maps especially created by National Geographic for its magazine or supplements.This physical map of the Arctic Ocean floor, pictured, first appeared in an issue of National Geographic in October 1971. It shows continental shelves, abyssal plains, ridges, and fracture zones. It was sold as a supplement to an Arctic map

All of them are laid over the top of Google’s own maps and each one features a brief description above a transparency slider that lets users see exactly how the old map relates to the new.

Examples from National Geographic include a wall map of Costa Rica, a map depicting how North Central America looked following the Second World War, detailed map of Civil War battles, a physical map of the Arctic Ocean floor, and the Lands of the Bible map from 1967.

Other
 maps include the deforestation of Brazil from Imazon and the Earth at 
Night from Nasa, plus maps from World Bank Group, Florida Emergency 
Management and the City of Edmonton.

NPP satellite over nine days in April 2012 and 13 days in October 2012.

National Geographic created the Lands of the Bible in 1967, pictured, and reformatted it in 2012. It features insets of The Holy Land, Walled city of Jerusalem, Traditional route of the Exodus, St. Paul's four journeys, and The Crusades

This map of the British Isles includes ferry routes along with places of interest such as ruins and battle sites. It was published in October 1979 as a companion to National Geographic's historical map Medieval England

Other maps include the deforestation of Brazil from Imazon, pictured. It contains information about legal and illegal roads to the Brazilian Amazon Biome and Protected Areas. Ticking the boxes at the side of the map will reveal, or remove settlement and official roads, indigenous land and Federal conservation units

The map of modern-day Tokyo, known in 1860 as Edo, was created by Hayashi, Yoshinaga, The East Asian Library at the University of California, Berkeley.

By moving the transparency slider, users can see that the centre of the map, around the Imperial Palace, has remained largely unchanged for more than 300 years.

Layered
 over the top of a map of the U.S., National Geographic's Battles of the Civil 
War map plots the major land campaigns, Union and Confederate troop 
movements, major Union naval campaigns, roads, railroads, dates of 
capture by Union forcesm and more.

All of these galleries in Google's Maps Gallery, National Geographic gallery pictured, are also being integrated into Google search results and Google is rumoured to be looking at ways to add the option for people to buy and download high-res versions of all the maps. A print version of each map is already available to buy

Two inset maps called the  Battle for the Capitals and Turning Points of the War show a timeline of battles with map location, casualties and impacts of battles.
