Lee Middleton  escaped and committed an armed robbery after stuffing his bed with pillows so it appeared he was fast asleep

An escaped prisoner terrorised a couple in an armed raid at their home – after stuffing his cell bed with pillows to sneak out of an open jail.

Lee Middleton, 32, was serving time for a string of armed robberies when he slipped out of HMP Hewell, leaving officers believing he was still asleep.

With an unknown accomplice, he travelled to an address in Coventry, 30 miles from the multi-category 1,261-inmate prison near Redditch, Worcestershire.

A court head how the masked men, armed with a knuckle duster and a knife, forced their way inside before Middleton threatened to smash terrified resident Matty Grove’s head in with a brick.

They made off with cash, mobile phones and Mr Grove’s £10,000 Audi S3 Quattro following the raid in June but Middleton was caught after a police chase.

Jail guards had no idea the violent criminal – classed as ‘dangerous’ by his original trial judge – was missing until police rang to say he was in custody.

Lal Amarasinghe, prosecuting, said: ‘The prison did not realise he had left until the police contacted them. He had left his bed with two pillows in it.’

Yesterday Mr Grove, 28, and girlfriend Danielle Ismay told of their shock that Middleton was able to sneak out of prison to commit the crime. Miss Ismay, 23, a receptionist, said: ‘It’s disgusting that he was able to get out of a prison to do this to us, particularly as he had been jailed for other burglaries and violent raids in the first place.

‘We have suffered a horrendous ordeal and were left so fearful of our safety that we had to move house.’

She said they could not believe it when police told them Middleton was a serving prisoner. The couple plan to sue the jail for negligence.

‘If the prison had done its job and kept Middleton locked up, he would never have been able to burgle us,’ Miss Ismay added.

On Tuesday Middleton was jailed at Warwick Crown Court for a total of 11 years and six months after earlier pleading guilty to the aggravated burglary, dangerous driving and driving while disqualified.

Judge Sylvia De Bertodano said it was ‘not quite clear’ how he had escaped, but added that it was ‘quite clear’ how dangerous he was.

She also told the court: ‘There must have been planning to the extent that someone must have met him (outside the prison) to take him there (to Coventry).’

Middleton had been seen by jail staff at 9.30pm, but at 11.40pm he was outside Mr Grove and Miss Ismay’s house in Coventry.

They used the brick to smash a pane on the front door to force their way inside, screaming ‘It’s the police!’ before Middleton began rifling through Miss Ismay’s bag.

Mr Grove, who works in logistics at a factory, told the Daily Mail: ‘I stood up to try to stop him emptying the bag, but he had picked up the brick and told me, “Sit down now or I will smash your head in”. It was a really nasty incident.’

Middleton, of Wyken, Coventry, had been given an indeterminate sentence, with a minimum of ten years, in 2007 for armed robberies committed with two accomplices. In one they terrorised a pregnant woman and her children before stealing £40,000 in possessions.

Lee Middleton's method of escape from HMP Hewell - by stuffing his bed with pillows to make it appear he was fast asleep - is actually tactic devised in one of the most notorious prison escapes of all time.

In 1962 Frank Lee Morris, along with fellow prisoners Clarence and John Anglin, escaped from Alcatraz prison by leaving hand built dummies with human-like heads in their beds to fool the patrolling guards.

They then crept out of their cells through tunnels they had spent years digging, before boarding a life raft when they reached the water.

Although it's been claimed the three men have been spotted in the years since the prison break, there have been no confirmed sightings of the three and it is likely they all died attempting to make it across San Francisco Bay.

In the decades since, the stunt has become one of the most infamous prison tales of all time, due to the fact it was remained the only successful escape from Alcatraz, and its portrayal in Hollywood films including 'Escape from Alcatraz' starring Clint Eastwood.
