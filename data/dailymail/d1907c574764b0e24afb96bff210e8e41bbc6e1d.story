Sir Cliff Richard is in ‘agony’ and feels imprisoned in Portugal following historic allegations of child sexual abuse, one of his closest friends said yesterday.

Almost a month after detectives raided his Berkshire home and despite having been quizzed by police, the star still has no idea who his accuser is, Gloria Hunniford said.

Miss Hunniford, 74, said she spoke to the singer on the phone yesterday before making her debut as host on ITV talk show Loose Women.

Revelations: Sir Cliff Richard (left) is 'going through agony' following allegations he sexually assaulted a 15-year-old schoolboy, Gloria Hunniford (right) today claimed on the revamped series of ITV's Loose Women

Revamped: The television presenter - who has known Sir Cliff for 45 years - phoned him especially for the panel show this afternoon. Above, Gloria appeared alongside Ruth Langsford, Coleen Nolan and Janet Street Porter

She told viewers: ‘I thought I’d ask him if was it all right to tell you how he is. These are absolutely his words.

'He said he’s totally devastated. He’s got no idea who his accuser is and, these are his words, he is appalled at what he regards as a completely false accusation. Those are his words. 

‘He couldn’t believe this would actually put him through such agony, and again he said “agony”.’

Miss Hunniford’s guest on the show was actress Joan Collins, 81, and her co-panellists were Ruth Langsford, 54, Coleen Nolan, 49, and Janet Street Porter, 67.

Gloria explained: 'Because Cliff loves coming on Loose Women I thought I’d ring him this morning, and ask him if it was it alright to tell you how he is. He’s totally devastated because he’s got no idea who his accuser is'

She added: 'He couldn’t believe that this would actually put him through such agony, again he said "agony"'

The presenter said she has known Sir Cliff for 45 years, adding: ‘I trust him with my life and genuinely I’ve never heard Cliff say a bad word about anybody or put a foot wrong.’

Two weeks ago, the 73-year-old singer flew briefly to Britain from his holiday villa in Portugal to be quizzed by South Yorkshire Police over an allegation from 1985. He met officers by appointment and was not arrested or charged.

Miss Hunniford added: ‘[Sir Cliff] said he’s never had so much support in his life, from fans, friends, family, and indeed the Press.

‘He’s got lots of good friends and they’ve been dipping down to Portugal to see him but he’s imprisoned really if you think about it.’

The revelations come just a month after police swooped on Sir Cliff's £3.1million home (pictured) in Berkshire

Speaking out: Four days ago, Sir Cliff took to Facebook to vow to clear his name following the allegation of sexual assault, which was first revealed on August 14. In it he thanked members of the public for their support

Four days ago, Sir Cliff took to Facebook to vow to clear his name following the allegation of sexual assault, which was first revealed on August 14.

In it he thanked members of the public, fans and 'those in the press' for their support.

He wrote: 'Hi everyone, this is just a brief message to thank all of you who have shown support, including those in the Press.

'I wanted to let you know that I'm doing ok and it goes without saying that I fully intend to clear my name.

'Just to be absolutely clear, the allegation is completely false and I will continue to cooperate with the police should they wish to speak to me again. Once again...many thanks!'

It was the second public statement he has made since the allegation was first revealed.

His first comments came on August 14, in which he acknowledged 'completely false' claims of 'sexual impropriety' had been circulating online for months.

He stated: 'Up until now I have chosen not to dignify the false allegations with a response, as it would just give them more oxygen.'

In a reference to the BBC's coverage of the raid, he added: 'However, the police attended my apartment in Berkshire today without notice, except it would appear to the press.'
