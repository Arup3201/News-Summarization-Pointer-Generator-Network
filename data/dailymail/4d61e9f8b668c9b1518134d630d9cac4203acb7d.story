Life-saving: A young child receives polio immunisation drops at a health post

Nine female polio vaccinators have been shot dead in two shootings in northern Nigeria.

Islamist militant group Boko Haram - a 
sect which has condemned the use of Western medicine - has been blamed for the attack.

In the first attack in Kano the polio vaccinators were shot dead by gunmen who drove up on a motor tricycle, reported the BBC.

Thirty minutes later gunmen targeted a clinic outside Kano city as the vaccinators prepared to start work.

Previously religious clerics had some of their followers stop 
receiving the vaccines saying that it would sterilise their children.

Boko Haram wants 
to impose Islamic law, or sharia, on a country of 160 million split 
roughly equally between Christians and Muslims. 

The group has carried out a spate of assaults on security forces in the city in 
recent weeks.

Despite The World Health Organisation’s international vaccination programme, the disease has never been eradicated and continues to attack children in Pakistan, Nigeria and Afghnaistan.

The numbers fell from 173 in 2011 to 53 in 2012 according to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.

It has also re-appeared in Nigeria because of malicious rumours that the Western-donated vaccine is harmful, while a renewed threat to Europe has emerged from with eastern side of the continent.

It is caused by a virus which attacks nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. It is spread via human faeces and leads to muscle weakness and painful spasms, followed by paralysis and sometimes death when the lungs are affected.

Post-polio syndrome is believed to affect at least eight out of ten of the survivors. Although the syndrome was first described by doctors in the Eighties, the scale of the problem is only just emerging, as more polio survivors live long enough to develop it.

Polio has not been reported in Britain since the mid-Sixties, but there are a number of celebrity survivors, including actors Mia Farrow and Donald Sutherland, film director Francis Ford Coppola, celebrity academic David Starkey, and singers Judy Collins and Neil Young.

Today's attack will be a further setback to efforts by global health organisations to eradicate polio in Nigeria, one of only three countries, along with Pakistan and Afghanistan, where the disease remains endemic.

In December gunmen in Pakistan shot dead aid workers running a U.N.-backed polio vaccination campaign.

The killings were a major setback for a campaign that international health officials consider vital to contain the crippling disease but which Taliban insurgents say is a cover for espionage.

Suspicion over the programme followed reports in 2011 that the CIA plotted a fake vaccination programme in Pakistan to snare Osama bin Laden's DNA.

Agents had reportedly started the vaccine drive against hepatitis B in Abbottabad, where they believed the Al Qaeda leader was hiding out just before he was killed, according to Pakistan officials and local residents.

Following the shootings the vaccination campaign was suspended indefinitely in the north-west tribal region of Pakistan - Quetta, Killa Abdullah and Pishin districts.
