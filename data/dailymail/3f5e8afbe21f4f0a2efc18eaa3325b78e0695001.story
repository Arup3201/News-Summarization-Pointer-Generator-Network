These snowy 'crop circles' look like they took ages to create.

No chance, then, that the imprints were made by alien lifeforms leaving behind remarkable patterns for us to gaze at.

Instead, they are the work of a lone artist who has spent up to ten hours a day trudging around a French ski resort.

The intricate patterns are huge - some span the equivalent size of six football pitches.

They are created by British artist Simon Beck while wearing snowshoes and come in a range of designs from snowflakes and spirals to cubes and more abstract creations.

Each pattern is crafted by Mr Beck alone in the skiing town of Les Arcs, in the French Alps, where he lives during winter.

And he uses an orienteering compass to create the perfect geometric designs.

Mr Beck, an orienteer leader, has created hundreds of the artworks after ploughing his first at Christmas in 2004.Â 

He uses what he describes as a 'kind 
of reverse orienteering' to plot his intricate paths before walking 
along the route in a pair of snowshoes.

He said: 'The main reason for making 
them was because I can no longer run properly due to problems with my 
feet, so plodding about on level snow is the least painful way of 
getting exercise.

'Gradually, the reason has become photographing them, and I am considering buying a better camera.'

Mr Beck, who studied Engineering 
Science at Oxford University, said many of his patterns can equal the 
effort needed to climb halfway up Mont Blanc, he said.

He added: 'I usually keep at it until I
 get too tired, using a headlamp if it gets dark first. It takes 
typically until I can't go on, but that can depend.

'The setting-out serves as the warm-up
 then the real training is completing the design. Once this second stage
 is started, I put on my personal stereo.'
