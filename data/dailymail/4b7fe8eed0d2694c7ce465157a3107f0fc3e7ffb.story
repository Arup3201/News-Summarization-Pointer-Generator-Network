A woman has apologized for sparking a major emergency operation on Wednesday, when she became trapped in an eight-inch slot between two walls in Portland, but has failed to explain what led her there in the first place.

Anita Mann, 30, became stuck in the tiny space between the parking garage of the Gretchen Kafoury Commons apartment complex and the New Avenues for Youth building in downtown Portland at 3.45am on Wednesday.

Firefighters worked for over three and a half hours to free her and had to cut an opening in 
the concrete wall of the parking lot and use soapy water to assist in 
squeezing her out.

Wedged: Anita Mann was stuck for more than three and a half hours on Wednesday morning as emergency workers tirelessly fought to release her

Rescue mission: Portland firefighters used an air bag to spread walls to free the Oregon woman and used soap to slip her out of a hole in the wall

She was left with just a few scrapes and minor hypothermia.

But one thing emergency services now want to know is - why was she there in the first place?

The only way to get to the gap is 
from the roof of the New Avenues building or from the top of a 20-foot wall 
on the side of the parking garage.

There was some speculation she was 
smoking on the rooftop, when she fell into the space, but both she and her
husband have remained tight-lipped on what she was doing since the rescue took place.

Police also investigated claims she was a graffiti artist but dropped their probe today.

'We looked into it and she is who she says she is,' an officer told the Oregonian. 'There were no paint cans lying around 
and no graffiti on the building.'

Mystery: No one knows what brought Anita Mann to the area and what led her to fall down the gap in downtown Portland only accessible via a rooftop

Sealed with a kiss: Anita and Brett Mann kissed passionately when she was released from the 8-inch space but neither have explained what brought her there

In a statement to the newspaper, she said she was sorry and grateful to have escaped.

'The events of the morning were awful
and ridiculously frightening. I am extremely thankful for the outcome 
of the situation I found myself facing. I profusely apologize for the 
disturbance and damage this has created,' she said.

Her husband Brett Mann, who was 
called from their home to help calm his wife during the rescue mission 
told the newspaper she was 'embarrassed' but couldn't explain any 
further.

'She's extremely embarrassed,' Mann, told the Oregonian on Thursday.

Hospitalized: Mann was taken to hospital by ambulance on Wednesday but only had minor injuries

Uncomfortable: Firefighters cut a hole through concrete and used an air bag and a soapy lubricant to free Mann who escaped with minor scrapes

Early operation: Firefighters worked from 3.45am to free Mann who fell part of the way down the 20-foot wall and got stuck between the two buildings

'She slid. She couldn't climb back up. She doesn't have the greatest recollection.'

The Fire Bureau's Lt. Rich Chatman told the newspaper it was an unusual case.

He said she was 'vague' about what happened, 'Nothing really seemed to make sense,' he told the local paper.

Mann added she was a medic in Canada, where she grew up, so knew the pressures on rescuers.

Home Forward, a government agency 
that owns the garage, told the newspaper it will cost several thousand 
dollars to repair the wall and they would seek to block up the gap so 
nothing like this can happen again.

They too are in the dark about what led Mann to be there in the first place.

'We are just all really wondering how it happened,' said Shelley Marchesi, a spokeswoman for the housing authority.

On Wednesday, alarmed residents of the building called 911.

Witness Kia King said she heard cries for help early in the morning and saw the woman trying to climb out of the small space.

'First,
she had the grip and she was holding on,' King said. 'Next thing you 
know, she started panicking and she let go and fell down.'

Measuring the damage: The owners of the wall say it could cost thousands to repair it. They are also planning to fill in the gap so something similar doesn't happen again
