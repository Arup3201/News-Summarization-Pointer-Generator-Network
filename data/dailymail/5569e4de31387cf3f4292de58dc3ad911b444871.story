Third-round weekend. Just saying those words takes me back to childhood and triggers the excitement I had for the FA Cup.

What a competition it used to be. From the start of the season to the beginning of December, I would regularly think about which team Everton would get drawn against on the first Saturday in January. The excitement and anticipation was massive because everyone was dreaming about Wembley.

I still remember the buzz of the build-up to the third round, taking in all the unusual stories in the papers, on the radio and TV about little-known players who had dreams of becoming household names. Third-round day itself was mixed with nerves and excitement. If I wasn't at the game, I'd be sat in front of the TV, glued to Grandstand.

We take it for granted now that goal updates come through immediately on websites, Soccer Saturday or to your phone but 25 years ago, you would pray for good news to flash up on the vidiprinter at the bottom of the screen.

Back in the 1980s, if you asked fans in August which trophy they would prefer to win, either the League Championship or the FA Cup, it would come down to the toss of a coin. That's how big it was: if a side's form in the league had tailed off by Christmas, the crowds would flock back for the third round.

I loved it when I was a kid and I loved it when I was a player, too. I cherish the two medals I won in 2001 and 2006, after Liverpool's victories against Arsenal and West Ham at the Millennium Stadium.

In 2001, as we chased an unprecedented cup treble, Gerard Houllier would regularly tell us the UEFA Cup would be the pinnacle of that campaign. In many respects he was right: you don't get the chance to win a European trophy every season. But for the English players in the dressing room, we were desperate to get our hands on the FA Cup.

Now, though, its appeal is on the wane and Paul Lambert's alarming comments about it being a commitment that Aston Villa could do without have illustrated where clubs see their priorities. The Barclays Premier League has become the be-all and end-all; such is the intensity of the competition and the excitement generated, every Saturday feels like third-round weekend once did.

That competition dominates to such an extent that if you ask fans now which they would prefer - to win the FA Cup or finish in the top four - the vast majority would pick the latter.

I understand the finances involved, but isn't football all about savouring the magical days when you get to celebrate a piece of silverware?

As a fan, I'd rather be in Wigan's situation of last season. Those supporters will have memories to take to the grave. Nobody remembers mid-table mediocrity.

The major thing I would do to revive it would be to abolish replays - all ties would have to reach a conclusion on the same day. I'd even be tempted to do away with extra-time and go straight to a penalty shootout if it was a draw at 90 minutes.

Replays are a waste of time. You rarely, if ever, see capacity crowds for replays now and it is embarrassing when games are staged with rows of empty seats in the background. That shows what fans think of them.

They also put an unnecessary strain on players in terms of fitness and create fixture congestion.

Sight for sore eyes: There were plenty of empty seats at last season's replay between West Brom and QPR

Few and far between: Fans didn't turn out in force for Wigan's FA Cup visit to the Stadium of Light in 2008

If you scrapped replays, you could move a round of league fixtures from the festive period, when players are vulnerable to muscle problems, back to a later date. Playing twice in three days at Christmas is ridiculous.

A win-or-bust situation would also leave managers thinking twice about making significant changes; plus, with rounds three, four and five being on weekends when no league games are scheduled, there would be no need to rest players if you knew there would be no replay looming.

Some will say that axeing replays would deprive lower division clubs of the chance to get a payday but what would be more special for them - the chance to dramatically claim a huge scalp or just going somewhere for a day out with no realistic chance of winning?

Another thing I would do is stage semi-finals at neutral venues. I played in semi-finals at Villa Park, Old Trafford and Wembley. While the one at Wembley was one of the best days of my career - we came from behind to beat Everton - the national stadium should be for one-off matches. Wembley should always feel special.

Time to celebrate: Carragher with team-mate Steven Gerrard in 2006

You would rather win the FA Cup than the Capital One Cup, but it feels as if the FA Cup is playing second fiddle at the minute. The League Cup has all the drama, the games are staged under lights, while the final itself stands alone in February, unlike the FA Cup, which competes with the climax of the Premier League and Champions League.

In 2011, remember, there was the ludicrous situation where Manchester City won the FA Cup on the same day Manchester United won the title.

What the League Cup has done is move with the times, as have the Premier League and the Champions League. They have evolved and are miles better than they were 20 years ago but, sadly, you can't say that about the FA Cup.

People like its tradition but life moves at a different pace now and there is no place for watching the Cup final on TV from 9am, as we used to. Some broadcasters tried that recently and it doesn't work.

So while the FA Cup is not on its last legs, I believe these small changes would make a difference. For a tournament that has given such joy to so many, it deserves to be helped.

It has been good to see Joe Hart remind people over Christmas what a top goalkeeper he is. He was man of the match when Manchester City beat Liverpool, got a black eye for his efforts against Crystal Palace and showed he has benefited from being taken out of the firing line by Manuel Pellegrini.

It is often said quality keepers are worth 10-12 points during a season and Hart has made a difference to City over the festive period. His saves against Liverpool and Palace turned two draws into wins.

I admire Pellegrini for being so bold. Hart is a far better keeper than Costel Pantilimon and was always going to get his place back but many other managers might have ducked the issue.

The most impressive thing, however, was Hart's reaction. He could not have dealt with it any better; he kept his thoughts to himself, he never went running to the press or created any tension.

I know how it feels to be out of the team when you think you should be playing. The only thing you can do, though, is take your medicine, keep your dignity and grab your chance when it comes along. Hart's done all those things and is getting his just rewards.

I outlined
 my hopes for the coming 12 months in last week's column, but now is the
 time to make a few predictions. There are five major trophies up for 
grabs between now and the end of the season and here's who I think will 
lift them.

1 PREMIER LEAGUE: Chelsea - They were my tip at the start of 
the season and I'm not deserting them. Manchester City have been the 
most impressive team so far but Jose Mourinho is the best manager in the
 league and could prove decisive.

2 CHAMPIONS LEAGUE: Real Madrid - It 
is about time they won it again. Cristiano Ronaldo deserves it for the 
way he has performed but the big thing in Madrid's favour is they have a
 kind draw. They can come out on top in the Lisbon final.

3 FA CUP: 
Liverpool - Teams who do not have Europe on their schedule, such as 
Everton and Newcastle, will be looking to target this trophy but 
Liverpool are enjoying a great season and have the weapons to beat 
anyone on their day.

4 CAPITAL ONE CUP: Manchester City - It looks like 
it will be an all-Manchester affair at Wembley on March 2 and after 
their game at the Etihad this season, a 4-1 City win, you would have to 
favour Manuel Pellegrini's men to come out on top.

5 EUROPA LEAGUE: 
Napoli - They were unlucky not to make the Champions League knockout 
stages. But, having spent heavily last summer, they are one of the best 
teams in the Europa League and, in Rafa Benitez, they have the manager 
who won it last season.
