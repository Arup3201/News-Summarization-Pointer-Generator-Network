Patrice Evra scored his first goal in Serie A but Juventus were held 1-1 at home by Champions League hopefuls Sampdoria on Sunday, ending the Turin club's home winning streak of 25 matches.

Evra, the former Manchester United left-back, put Juventus ahead with a header following a corner 12 minutes in.

Allowed time to line up a shot from the edge of the area, Sampdoria substitute Manolo Gabbiadini equalized in the 51st by shooting inside the far post for his sixth goal of the season.

It was Juve's last home match of 2014, so ending the winning streak at the Juventus Stadium was especially bitter so close to completing a perfect year.

The last time Juve dropped points at home in the Italian league was a 1-1 draw with Cagliari in May 2013, while the last loss was a 2-1 defeat to Sampdoria in January 2013.

'They're really strong here. They're also tough on the road but here they have another gear,' Gabbiadini said. 'We struggled in the first half, which was expected, but we managed to equalise.'

After the lunchtime fixture, three-time defending champions Juventus moved four points ahead of second-place Roma.

Juventus also drew their previous match, 0-0 at Fiorentina.

'It's too bad, because we created a ton of chances in the first half and we didn't take advantage of them all,' said Juve's coach Massimiliano Allegri.

Sampdoria, who stretched their unbeaten streak to six matches, moved level third on points with Genoa and Lazio in the race for the final Champions League berth.

Perhaps keeping in mind that the Italian Super Cup in Doha, Qatar is coming up on December 22, Allegri rested midfield maestro Andrea Pirlo.

Juventus was also without the suspended defender Giorgio Chiellini.

Despite the early kick-off, Juventus were sharp from the start with Alvaro Morata and Roberto Pereyra threatening in the opening 10 minutes.

Despite his comparatively small stature at 5ft 9in, the 33-year-old Evra leaped to meet a corner from Claudio Marchisio at the edge of the box and score an impressive goal.

Evra, who joined Juventus on a two-year contract in July, only scored seven goals in 273 Premier League matches with United.

Midway through the first half, France midfielder Paul Pogba nearly made it 2-0 after expertly controlling a 60-yard pass from Leonardo Bonucci but couldn't find the target.

Two minutes after the break, Pereyra had a good look but his shot from a tight angle went high.

Sampdoria coach Sinisa Mihajlovic replaced Nenad Krsticic with Gabbiadini to start the half and the move paid off when he shot past outstretched Gianluigi Buffon to draw the visitors level.

Buffon then preserved the draw by tipping a shot wide from Gabbiadini that had deflected off the back of defender Angelo Ogbonna.
