A great grandmother whose 'dream' Egyptian getaway was ruined when she contracted a severe case of gastric illness has received £3,500 in compensation from her tour operator.

Kathleen Smith, from Rawtenstall, Lancashire, suffered from abdominal cramps, diarrhoea and drowsiness just two days into her family getaway at MinaMark Beach Resort at the Red Sea resort of Hurghada.

The 72-year-old believes her sickness was caused by hotel food that was left uncovered and exposed to flies.

The great grandmother was prescribed medication for acute gastroenteritis after she returned home

Mrs Smith became so sick that she was placed on an intravenous drip in her hotel room, she was unable to sleep and her symptoms continued for 12 days in June and July of 2013.

She was prescribed medication for acute gastroenteritis when she visited her GP after she returned home with her 47-year-old daughter Lindsey, 26-year-old granddaughter Karli, 26, and five-year-old great granddaughter Lex-May.

She said: ‘It was a really horrible experience. The illness ruined our holiday, falling so ill during a holiday is not something you expect to happen.’

She contacted Your Holiday Claims to pursue a claim for compensation against Thomas Cook, which agreed to pay £3,500 in compensation. She booked the holiday through Flexibletrips.com, a Thomas Cook subsidiary. 

The 72-year-old said her illness 'ruined' her trip with her daughter, granddaughter and great granddaughter

A Thomas Cook spokesperson said in a statement: 'We have extended our apologies to the party, and can confirm that we have reached agreement with their legal representatives to resolve this matter to the customer’s satisfaction.

'We would like to assure customers that incidents of this type are rare, as Thomas Cook and its subsidiary FlexibleTrips works closely with the management of all the properties to which it operates to ensure that only the very highest hygiene standards are maintained.

'We would kindly ask any customers who may have concerns relating to their holiday to contact us directly and as quickly as possible so that we can deal with them personally in an open, honest and fair manner.'
