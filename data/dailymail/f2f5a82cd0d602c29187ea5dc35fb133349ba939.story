Lewis Hamilton has come under fire from his hometown council following 'derogatory' and 'unfair' comments he made about Stevenage in the build up to last week's Monaco Grand Prix.

Speaking ahead of the race, Hamilton, who was raised in the Hertfordshire town, claimed he was hungrier than his rival for the Formula One title Nico Rosberg because of his humble beginnings.

The Briton, who finished second in Sunday’s race, said: ‘I come from a not-so-great place in Stevenage and lived on a couch in my dad’s apartment – and Nico grew up in Monaco with jets and hotels and boats and all these kinds of things – so the hunger is different.’

But in response to Hamilton’s comments, Stevenage Councillor Philip Bibby said: ‘I can’t see how he can say such things about the place where he grew up. He needs to remember his roots.

‘The council runs numerous schemes with the aim of providing opportunities for all our young people – from the academic through to the athletic and artistic types. His comments are unfair.’

Howard Burrell, Stevenage’s representative for young people, culture, sport, and leisure, added: ‘I think Stevenage is a great place to grow up and there was no need for Lewis to be so derogatory in his comments. It’s where he came from, after all.

‘I would prefer it if he chose to highlight some of the benefits of coming from our town as he is, without question, the most successful sportsperson we have ever produced. There is no need to say such things about his home town.’

Hamilton trails Rosberg by four points after the German secured victory around the streets of Monte Carlo in this most intense of championship battles.

The relationship between the two childhood friends hit rock bottom in the principality after Hamilton believed Rosberg had cheated his way to pole despite the race stewards clearing the German of any wrongdoing.

A seething Hamilton admitted after the race that he is no longer friends with Rosberg, but Mercedes Toto Wolff believes the intensity between his two drivers is to be expected.

‘It’s an intense relationship but this intensity is normal,’ said Wolff.

‘The racing philosophy of Mercedes is to allow our drivers to compete; we let the boys play with their toys unless they break them. Both drivers know we will not tolerate any incident.’
