Scores of passengers on board a luxury cruise liner have had their £2,000 holidays ruined by a sickness outbreak.

Around 170 passengers on the Boudicca were hit by the suspected norovirus during its 13-night trip to the Canary Islands.

The virus, which causes vomiting and diarrhoea, is highly contagious and those infected were quarantined during the doomed voyage.

'Cursed': The Boudicca, which has been hit by outbreaks several times before, was infected again during a 13-night cruise to the Canary Islands

The ship, carrying around 828 passengers and 348 crew, was greeted by NHS staff and ambulance crews when it docked in Greenock, Scotland last night.

One passenger told the Daily Mirror: ‘We started calling the ship HMS Holby City.

‘There were two nurses wandering around all the time visiting people, most of them elderly.

‘Half the facilities were shut down and we were even told not to swap quiz sheets to stop the bug spreading.

‘Passengers were offered £150 discounts on their next cruise. We don’t know anyone who accepted.

‘People had spent up to £2000 on the cruise and their holidays have been ruined.’

The 53-year-old woman said a woman in her 80s, who suffered a heart attack, was winched off by a helicopter rescue crew after a stop in Madeira.

It is not known if her condition was linked to the outbreak.

The Boudicca, owned by Fred Olsen, underwent an intensive fumigation yesterday before leaving for a cruise to the Adriatic 90 minutes later than scheduled.

The deep cleaning process was supervised by experts from Greater Glasgow and Clyde NHS.

It was hit by three sickness outbreak in as many weeks in 2010 and forced to cut short its voyage and return to port on one of those occasions.

A spokeswoman for Fred Olsen said the latest bug was a viral infection which caused mild gastroenteritis symptoms.

The spokeswoman said: ‘During this cruise, the highest number of guests needing to be kept in isolation at any one time was 35, out of a total number of people on board of 1,176, comprising 828 guests and 348 crew.

‘The total number of cases reported during the 13-night cruise was 170.

‘Boudicca returned to Greenock yesterday, and departed on a 21-night 'Adriatic with Croatia' cruise D1210 last night.

‘She departed at 6pm, instead of the original scheduled time of 4.30pm, in order for a complete and intensive fumigation process to take place, details and timings of which were notified to all guests prior to the cruise’s departure. The cleaning procedure went ahead, and also included the Cruise Terminal.

‘The Port Health team spent 30 minutes examining the ship and she was given the necessary clearance to sail from the Port.

‘At Fred Olsen Cruise Lines, the health, safety and well-being of our guests and crew on board remains our priority at all times, and we believe that our systems for preventing the spread of illness on board our ships are amongst the best within the industry.

‘Fred Olsen Cruise Lines' ships meet, at all times, the highest safety, hygiene and health standards, and comply fully with the strict requirements and inspections of their Flag State and relevant authorities.’
