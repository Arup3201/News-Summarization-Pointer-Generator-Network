It is one of London's most iconic venues, but Southbank's Oxo Tower restaurant has been voted to have the 'most disappointing cooking' in the 2015 edition of Harden's London Restaurants guide.

And Hammersmith's much-loved River Cafe didn't fare much better, dubbed an 'overcrowded' and 'impersonal place' where 'uneventful' dishes come at 'merciless prices'.

While celebrity favourite Chiltern Firehouse - frequented by Cara Delevingne and Lindsay Lohan - may be an 'amazing' room, the Hardenʼs survey found the food at Andre Balazsʼs hotel where 'poseurs and paparazzi abound' actually 'meh'.

 The Ledbury in Notting Hill was named London's best restaurant after coming first in the Top Gastronomic Experience, Highest Rated Restaurant (Food) and Highest Rated Restaurant (Overall) lists

Cara Delevingne and Lindsay Lohan have been seen at Chiltern Firehouse. The food at the restaurant was described as 'meh' by the guide's reporters 

But it's not all doom and gloom in the capital's dining scene. 

The Ledbury in Notting Hill was named London's best restaurant after coming first in the Top Gastronomic Experience, Highest Rated Restaurant (Food) and Highest Rated Restaurant (Overall) lists. 

Neighbourhood restaurant Chez Bruce in Wandsworth Common was – for the 10th year running – voted Londonʼs Favourite Restaurant, marking an incredible double for restaurateur Nigel Platts-Marin who is also the backer of The Ledbury.

Simon Roganʼs relaunch of Claridgeʼs dining room – Fera at Claridgeʼs – didn't go unnoticed, claiming the accolade for being the highest rated newcomer of the year.

The yearling is already Londonʼs 12th most talked about restaurant thanks to its 'sensationally subtle' cuisine.

Gordon Ramsey's Royal Hospital Road restaurant in Chelsea is back in the Top Gastronomic Experience list

After his disappearance from the Top 10 gastronomic experience list last year, Gordon Ramsay mounted something of a comeback. His flagship Royal Hospital Road restaurant (helmed by Clare Smyth)has returned to the list.

The Anchor & Hope in Waterloo nabbed top stop for the ninth year in the Best Bar/Pub Food list with reviewers heaping praise on the 'convivial' South Bank boozer – with its 'hearty' but 'superbly precise' British cooking.  

By contrast, appearing on the Most Disappointing Cooking list for the first time is Ollie Dabbousʼs eponymous flagship, Dabbous in Fitzrovia.

It appears alongside Marcus Wareingʼs relaunched Marcus at the Berkeley and Heston Blumenthalʼs hotel dining room, Dinner at the Mandarin Oriental.

Once again Oxo Tower retains its unenviable status as the home of Londonʼs Most Disappointing Cooking with Harden's reporters saying the 'lazy' tourist trap remains 'as awful as ever'

But for the first time in 15 years it has escaped a double on the 'lists of shame' giving up the crown to The River Cafe which had the dubious honour of appearing on top of the Most Overpriced Restaurant List.

The 24th edition of Harden's London Restaurants also recorded the highest ever rate of net new restaurant openings in the capital, with a whopping 148 new eateries popping up in the last year. 

The figure for closings, 47, was the lowest this millennium, resulting in net openings this year of 101 – nearly a third higher than the previous record of 75 (noted in the guide's 2006 edition).

The guide's co-founder, Peter Harden said: 'This exceptional level of growth is a fabulous achievement for the capital, but raises questions about its sustainability. 

'It underlines London's continued emergence as the greatest restaurant city on the planet, but – in the 24 years in which we have tracked openings – such highpoints have also often heralded more competitive times ahead.'

The guide collated scores from more than 65,000 reviews posted by over 6,000 'ordinary diners' to compile the rankings.
