Dwain Chambers, the old man of British sprinting, shocked his young rivals by beating them to the 100 metres crown at the Sainsbury's British Championships in Birmingham on Sunday.

The 36-year-old clinched his fifth straight domestic title in 10.12 seconds, edging out Harry Aikines-Aryeetey by just 0.02secs at the Alexander Stadium.

Favourite Chijindu Ujah was third in 10.18.

Chambers' victory booked his place on the Great Britain team for August's European Championships in Zurich.

He was ranked 10th in the country going into the weekend, though, and had to call on all his experience to hold back the tide of young talent, headed by Ujah, who ran 9.96 earlier this month.

And the former drug cheat admitted his career could have been over had the race not gone to plan.

'It is just such a relief; there is a lot of young potential out there,' Chambers said. 'I was running for my life. Any one of those guys could have got me, everyone raises their intensity, so I knew I had to raise my performance too and fortunately I did it.

'I train with CJ (Ujah), so I know how
 good he is in the second half of the race, so I just tried to stay 
ahead of him. I put myself on the line knowing that, if I didn't do it 
now, then that was it.

Training partners: Chambers and Ujah know each other well but as Ujah said, 'experience won'

'Earlier in the season, things weren't going well and, if it didn't go well today, I knew it was done. I would have had to seriously review my situation.'

Aikines-Aryeetey's second place also booked his spot for Zurich, with Ujah having to rely on the discretion of the selectors for the third spot.

On his race, Ujah said: 'I came here to win, but unfortunately, it was a matter of putting three races together. I got cramp on the very first step (in the final) and experience won today.'

James Dasaolu, who ran 9.91 here last year, missed the event this time around through injury and so could miss out on selection for the Europeans, having also failed to make England's Commonwealth Games team.
