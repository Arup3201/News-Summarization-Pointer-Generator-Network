By leaving the exposure open for 45 minutes, a London-based photograph has managed to capture layers of flightpaths over the city.

The result is a magical pattern of colourful lines in the night sky as aircraft go in and out of Heathrow Airport.

London-based photographer Joel Devlin, 34 originally from the West country, recorded the air traffic and their unique patterns for his project, Aviation Vectors.

The colourful lines look even more dramatic against a darker sky at night

To record the aircrafts' flight patterns, Joel sets his camera on long exposures of up to 45 minutes.

Heathrow, where Devlin based his project, is one of the busiest airports in the world in terms of traffic, giving him plenty of options for his pattern creation.

Despite only having two runways, Heathrow serves 80 countries, hosting an average of 1,288 flights a day.

Last year 70 million passengers arrived and left the airport.

The most popular destinations are New York, Dubai, Dublin, Frankfurt and Amsterdam.
