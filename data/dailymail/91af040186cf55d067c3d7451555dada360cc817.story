Bizarre world: AK-47s were in the marital home of Amedy Coulibaly and Hayat Boumeddiene

AK-47s and ammunition were stacked neatly by the laundry basket at the home of France’s most wanted woman and her kosher deli killer husband when police raided four years ago, it has emerged.

An extraordinary series of police interviews lay bare the bizarre marriage of terrorist Amedy Coulibaly and his wife Hayat Boumeddiene.

They also reveal Boumeddiene, who is the fugitive suspected of helping mastermind the Paris attacks, had a sister living in Britain.

Boumeddiene was quizzed by police in 2010 after they found ammunition for deadly assault rifles ‘piled neatly’ next to a washing basket in her flat.

She told the interviewers she did not leave the house because she hated the ‘aggressive looks’ she got for wearing her veil.

She also called for sharia law to be implemented across the world, branded Israel ‘disgusting’ and spoke of her brothers and sisters, including one called Mimouna who lived in England. It is not known whether she is still here. 

It is the second British link to the atrocities to emerge. The Paris terrorists were allegedly mentored by Djamel Beghal, 50, a former lieutenant of the notorious imam Abu Hamza.

Beghal’s wife Sylvie, 45, a French citizen, lives in Leicester with her four children.

Officers in 2010 found ‘large quantities’ of ammunition for Kalashnikovs and AK47s along with a machine for counting money, police records reveal, all neatly stacked next to a laundry basket in Boumeddiene's and Coulibaly's flat near Paris.

Over four days, she was asked her views on terror attacks, her husband’s friends, their relationship, her mobile phone contracts, internet use and income and whether she had access to weapons. 

However, the brunette of Algerian origin was later released. She fled to Turkey before last week's attacks in which her husband murdered four Jewish people and has now crossed into Syria.

The 26-year-old, who was photographed shooting a crossbow in her burkha, is suspected of importing automatic weapons from eastern Europe to France to be used in the attacks that left a total of 17 people dead last week.

She told interrogators in 2010: ‘I know everything my husband says is good for me. I trust him completely'.

But the marriage almost broke down when her husband, who had the unlikely nickname of ‘Dolly’ among his friends, said he wanted a second wife, she explained.

Couibaly, who belonged to the same radical Islamist gang as the Kouachi brother gunmen responsible for the Charlie Hebdo massacre, had asked close friend Cherif Kouachi to find him a second wife.

The couple had a 'simple fight' about his wishes for a second bride and then put the issue behind them, she told police.

The incredible details emerged in series of interviews of Boumeddiene over four days in 2010 after Coulibaly was arrested by counter-terrorism police on suspicion of having taken part in a plot to aid the prison escape of Smaïn Aït Ali Belkacem.

He received a prison sentence and is reported to have been released from prison just over a year ago.

Boumeddiene was born in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-sur-Marne into a family of seven on June 26, 1988.

She has two brothers and three sisters, one of whom was living at the time in England, Hayat told police during the interviews.

Her mother died when she was just six years old and her delivery driver father Mohamed is believed to have struggled to raise the children on his own.

‘I was put into care when I was 12 years old because I could not accept my mother’s death and the quick remarriage of my dad,’ Boumeddiene told police.

She was moved from foster come to foster home because she by her own admission ‘was often getting into fights’.

It has now emerged that the troubled teenager spent time living on the streets and had a criminal record from age 13 when she fought with a social worker and a policewoman.

Acknowledging her troubled past, she said that finding Islam had helped her to find stability and had given her ‘answers’.

She described herself as ‘a practicing Sunni' and told the anti-terror police: 'I had the idea to go back to my origins. I bought books in Paris. I read a lot and realized that all my past was an error.

She added: ‘I have had a difficult past and this religion answers all my questions and calms me.

'Since then I have tried to practice religion the best I can and it helps me find my wellbeing.'

She said she had begun wearing the veil in 2009 after leaving a job at a supermarket where she was not allowed to wear it. She then took a job at a call centre.

Pictures that have emerged of her in a bikini in the Dominican Republic in 2008 predate her commitment to Islam, she explained.

‘At the time I was not a practicing Muslim...Today I don’t wear it any more unless it’s just women there', she told her captors.

But the interviews show how far the burkha-clad jihadi had already come from that girl in a bikini.

The Islamist radical told police she thought that Sharia law should be implemented world wide and said that she believed the 9/11 killings might have been carried out by the US government.

She said: ‘Sharia is the law of god, so I think that it would be best if it was applied.’

She refused to condemn Al Qaeda attacks but said she wanted to get involved in humanitarian efforts.

‘For me the war is to be condemned but when Americans, for example, kill innocent people it’s obviously justifiable that men take up arms to defend their women and children,’ she said.

Asked her opinion on the conflict between Israel and Palestine, she replied: ‘The UN gave the Jews that land because of the hell they went through with Hitler and everything.

‘But considering that the Jews who have grown up in their state have not respected the rights of the Palestinians, excuse my expression, but it is disgusting.’

But she claimed that she did not believe in jihad as she did ‘believe that today's jihads are really authorised by God’.

The couple’s relationship emerges as unbalanced with Coulibaly controlling and rigid.

'I stay at home,’ she told her interrogators. ‘I don’t go out except to do the shopping’.

Her husband told her nothing of his affairs, she claimed, and she did not even know his friends' names as she has to stay in her room when they visit.

Coulibaly had no close friends since his best friend Ali was shot while running away from police in 2000, she claimed.

But the couple did spend time with Cherif Kouachi and his wife, 'as a four', she said.

Coulibaly went to the suspected terror camp at the home of an Al Qaeda kingpin known as Abou Hamza in central France every third week, sometimes accompanied by Cherif, she said.

She herself went just twice 'to go hiking' she claimed and she there learnt to fire a crossbow. But the conversation revolved simply around ‘sport, the fresh air and countryside’, she told police.

But investigators' phone taps mentioned in the interrogation suggest the bikini-babe turned burkha wearing extremist knew more than she let on.

Police questioned her about a call in which husband asked her to ‘put aside 1000 euro for the brothers’.

But Boumeddiene claimed she thought he mean her to put away some money for Palestinian children. ‘I give immediately if I see someone is in need' she said.
