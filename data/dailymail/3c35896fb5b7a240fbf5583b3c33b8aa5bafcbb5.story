Hatem Ben Arfa is an £8million target for Serie A side Roma.

Sportsmail understands Newcastle’s management team have lost patience with the France forward, whose form and fitness have dipped since the turn of the year.

Ben Arfa is out of contract next summer 
and, with a new deal on Tyneside unlikely, the club could
 cash in at the end of the season with reports emerging from Italy suggesting Roma are keeping tabs on his situation.

Target: Roma coach Rudi Garcia (left) wants Ben Arfa, which could suit Newcastle manager Alan Pardew

Il Sussidiario have said that the former Marseille man is a target of Roma coach Rudi 
Garcia, who sees him operating in the playmaker role. The paper have also 
credited Arsenal and Inter Milan with an interest.

Meanwhile, Newcastle
 boss Alan Pardew and his backroom staff have attempted to tailor a 
training programme for Ben Arfa in a bid to bring about an improvement in his form.

But the 27-year-old remains far from peak fitness and was visibly out of shape during his last appearance as a substitute at Stoke earlier this month.

One on occasion during that match he overran the ball and was clattered into by an opponent, suffering the dead leg which was said to have kept him out of last weekend’s defeat by Swansea City.

He subsequently returned to France and it is thought he is unlikely to appear when Newcastle travel to Arsenal on Monday night.

Out: Ben Arfa limps off after being injured against Stoke and will probably miss Monday's clash with Arsenal
