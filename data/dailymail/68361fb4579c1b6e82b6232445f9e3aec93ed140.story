Senior Nationalists have drawn up plans to demand a £30billion 'divorce settlement' from the UK if Scotland votes Yes to independence.

They want talks to begin 'within days' of a Yes vote, expecting Westminster to agree to what would be the most expensive break-up of any country in the history of international relations.

The Nationalists will demand a share of every single asset owned by the British State, from the Channel Tunnel to the military bases in the Falkland Islands.

Battle: If Alex Salmond is victorious in his campaign for Scottish independence, opposed by Alistair Darling, he will begin a bid to claim one-twelfth of the UK Government's assets

Overall, the UK owns £337billion-worth of property, assets and equipment around the world, from embassies and consulates to art works and aircraft carriers.

Scotland has one-twelfth of the UK's population, which the SNP believes would entitle Scotland to claim a share worth just under £30billion.

If Scots do vote Yes on Thursday, Alex Salmond will immediately start demanding that Scotland gets its share of these assets - even before the celebrations of his fellow Nationalists have died down.

It is understood that senior Nationalists expect the process to start as early as next Monday - four days after the referendum.

The SNP would then get its negotiating team in place, ready to start the preliminary talks on the break-up of the UK - and they would expect the UK Government to do the same.

Claim: The British Museum has been valued at more than £200million according to an official document

Dispute: The Channel Tunnel is one of the British assets which the Scottish Nationalists believe they have a part-share in

A senior figure in the SNP said yesterday: 'We are ready to go. We know who will be in our team.'

Alex Salmond's senior aides have also been studying a little-known list of all the buildings, assets and equipment owned by the UK Government at home and abroad.

As a result, they believe they know exactly what is owned by the UK Government and will submit a list of what they want to come to Scotland on Independence Day.

'Everything is in there,' said an SNP insider. 'The only thing is that the asset register has not been updated for a few years, so it is conceivable that many things in there will actually be worth more than the stated value in the document.'

The items they believe they should get a share of include the Channel Tunnel, the British Embassy in Paris and even Number Ten Downing Street.

The Nationalists have warned they will walk away from the liabilities of the UK - including its mountainous debt - unless they get thier way on a share of the assets.

Headquarters: 10 Downing Street, which this week flew the saltire flag, 

The assets of the UK Government include every piece of military equipment as well as works of art on display at UK bases around the world - and the SNP wants Scotland to get its population share of each one.

The list includes:

The Scottish Government made it clear before the campaign started that this would be the approach taken by SNP Ministers in any post-referendum negotiations.

Base: The UK's military facilities on the Falkland Islands are also included in the list of assets

A spokesman declared: 'Scotland and Scottish taxpayers have contributed to funding all the assets owned by the UK state over many years. It is only fair and reasonable that Scotland should receive a fair share of the value of these assets on independence.'

Indeed, the SNP asset-grabbing approach was laid out in its White Paper on Independence, published last November.

This made it clear that Ministers would expect to get a population share of UK assets and, while it would be impossible to give Scotland an actual cut of every asset, Scotland would expect at least the financial value of the country's share of the UK's assets.

The UK Government has refused to even admit that independence might cause the break-up of the British state and UK Governments has, at least publicly, refused to put contingency plans in place.

But it is understood that UK Ministers now realise the scale of the negotiations they might have to enter into if Scots vote Yes this week.

Some of the negotiations over the sharing out of the UK's assets will be relatively straightforward. There are already many UK Government buildings in Scotland which would immediately transfer over to the Scottish Government after independence.

But even if every building, every piece of equipment, artwork and asset in Scotland was added up, it would still leave the Scottish Government claiming a multi-billion share of the rest of the UK's assets. Nationalist negotiators expect their UK counterparts to give Scotland the cash value.

But a UK Government spokesman did not accept that Scotland would be given everything the SNP is demanding if Scots do leave the UK.

He said: 'A vote to leave the UK is a vote to leave its institutions. The division of assets and liabilities would be a matter for negotiation between the continuing UK and an independent Scotland.'
