Even at this late stage Roger Federer has plenty left to do in the 2014 season, whereas for Andy Murray it could be as good as over on Tuesday night.

Federer looks set for another run into the last four of the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals before trying to win the Davis Cup final for Switzerland, the one significant prize that eludes him.

His partner in achieving that dream, Stan Wawrinka, got off to a flying start on Monday with a 6-1, 6-1 victory against Tomas Berdych.

Novak Djokovic later then brushed aside US Open champion Marin Cilic by the same scoreline, completing a faintly embarrassing brace of one-sided matches which lasted a total of just one hour and 54 minutes.

Murray plays Canada’s Milos Raonic on Tuesday evening and if he cannot overcome the world No 8 then his chances of survival to the weekend are almost certainly finished.

Murray may be running out of opportunities to win this tournament on home soil. The O2 Arena is guaranteed as the venue next year but then it is up for grabs.

Proposals from Moscow, Doha and Beijing are believed to be in the offing, while Rio de Janeiro has expressed interest in the past.

In the other Group B match on Tuesday, Federer tackles Kei Nishikori.

Wawrinka believes that his 33-year-old Swiss team-mate has the ability and fitness to do well here and then make the switch to clay for the Davis Cup final against France in Lille starting a week on Friday. 

The man known as ‘Stanimal’ said: ‘Roger is the best player ever to adapt to a different surface, it takes him one hour or one day maximum. I am sure he will find a way to play well on clay and be ready to win the Davis Cup.’
