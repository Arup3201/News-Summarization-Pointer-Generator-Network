Cricket Australia are facing possible legal action for defamation from the ground announcer who was stood down for allegedly making racist remarks about Monty Panesar.

David Nixon, video producer for Australian Broadcasting Company who helped out on the PA system for the Alice Springs game, is gathering evidence in support of his case with the help of ABC radio colleagues.

It was reported by the Australian media that CA had acted after Nixon had pronounced Panesar’s name with an exaggerated Indian accent. A CA statement said they ‘deemed the conduct of the PA announcer as inappropriate and he will take no further part in the match.’

Not wise: And Cricket Australia, who also tweeted this picture captioned 'Will the real Monty Panesar please stand up?', could face legal action for standing him down

However Nixon says: ‘I’m considering my options because of the damage to my reputation. There is no way I mocked Monty with an Indian accent. I just said “Here’s Monty” loudly and in a jovial way as he came on to bowl.

‘CA have no evidence against me. We have dozens of witnesses agreeing there was no racist element to what I said.’

There is no recording of Nixon’s introduction to Panesar nor was any complaint made by the England touring party, who had no knowledge of the fuss until it appeared in the media.

The Football League’s belated intervention into Jim Price, agent of Nottingham Forest manager Billy Davies, running the club on a daily basis despite not having passed the owners and directors test, is also expected to lead to scrutiny of Forest’s transfer dealings.

Agents have complained that unlicensed operator Brian O’Neil, a Scottish former footballer with Celtic, Derby and Preston, has been acting for Forest. The club were unavailable for comment on Friday — not for the first time.

Elite referee Lee Probert, who has been given three Premier League games over Christmas, had been a surprising absentee from the match list since November 9.

Insiders believed his lack of PL games might be connected to his friendship with controversial former ref Mark Halsey whose comments criticising the standard of officiating this season and calls for the head of refs boss Mike Riley so infuriated the PL.

But a League spokesman described that theory as ‘nonsense’ and insisted that Probert, who was fit enough for Football League duty during that period, had a back problem affecting his foot and lacked the required fitness for the top flight.

No problem: Lee Probert hasn't refereed for almost two months, but a League spokesman insisted it was because of injury and nothing else

Former LTA chief executive Roger Draper, who enjoyed a ludicrous salary and bonus package of £640,000 in his last year, has told people he would consider a move into football. No wonder, as that sport also pays out barmy amounts of money, but not necessarily in Draper’s direction.

It’s Test Match $pecial

Peter Baxter left as producer of BBC’s Test Match Special in 2007, but six years later he is still trying to cash in on TMS memories on an Australian theatre roadshow with Henry Blofeld, who at least still commentates.

Less surprising is rabid self-publicist Jonathan Agnew, the BBC’s cricket correspondent, planning separate TMS-related UK tours after the Ashes, first with Geoff Boycott and then with Phil Tufnell.

The BBC have nothing to do with these private ventures that feed off the TMS name, with producer Adam Mountford saying diplomatically: ‘I don’t have a view on them.’

Meanwhile the preposterous Agnew has proposed TMS colleague Simon Hughes for election to the main MCC committee, saying ‘his skill in expressing himself candidly would enable Simon to make a real and lasting contribution.’

This is the same Simon Hughes who tweeted that he didn’t think Jonathan Trott had a stress-related illness but came home because he was ‘freaked out’ by Mitchell Johnson.

William Derby, chief executive of York racecourse, has emerged as the early front-runner to take over at Ascot when Charles Barnett retires after the 2014 Royal Meeting.

Derby, in command when York hosted Ascot’s showcase in 2005 during rebuilding work, has turned down other opportunities in racing to wait for the right opening.
