A 43-year-old man caught hacking out chunks of an ancient California redwood to sell for furniture has been ordered to pay $11,000 restitution.

Danny E. Garcia must also undertake 700 hours of community service as part of his one-year suspended sentence for poaching burls from trees in Redwood National and State Parks.

The California man was one of two people convicted of felony vandalism after rangers tracked slabs cut from the redwood to a furniture shop last year. 

Park rangers say burl poaching has been going on for years due to high unemployment and drug addiction, as the knobby growths can fetch thousands of dollars.

Damaging: Northern California park officials say that poachers are 
endangering 1,000-year-old coastal redwoods by hacking off burls to sell

Larry Morrow, 34, also of Orick, California pleaded guilty to vandalism charges and was sentenced earlier this month to three years probation and ordered to pay $1600 restitution, SFGate reported.

According to a National Park Service statement, Garcia and Morrow were arrested following a year-long investigation.

On April 19 last year, a bear researcher in the park discovered giant burls cut off a a 10-foot thick old growth redwood tree just 
south of the mouth of the Klamath River. The cut left a scar measuring 8 
feet by 10 feet.

Over
 the course of weeks, the thieves cut the burl into slabs weighing more 
than 100 pounds each that they dragged behind ATVs through the woods 
several hundred yards to a road.

An anonymous tip led to the discovery of the burls at a local shop in Del Norte County.

After matching the wood to 
pieces left behind at the scarred tree, investigators seized the slabs. The dealer
 had paid $1,600 for eight slabs that he was going to sell for $700 
apiece, for a total of $5,600.

NPS
 Law Enforcement Rangers indicated that Garcia had been in possession of
 the burls taken from the site, and then sold them to the shop. The burl
 shop was not investigated.

Authorities
 say unemployment and drug addiction have spurred an increase in the 
destructive practice of cutting off the knobby growths at the base of 
ancient redwood trees to make decorative pieces like lacey-grained 
coffee tables and wall clocks.

The
 practice — known as burl poaching — has become so prevalent along the 
Northern California coast that Redwood National and State Parks now 
closes the popular Newton B. Drury Scenic Parkway at night in a 
desperate attempt to deter thieves.

Law
 enforcement Ranger Laura Denny said that poachers have been stalking 
the remote reaches of the park with their chain saws and ATVs for 
decades, but lately the size and frequency of thefts have been on the 
rise.

'When I interview suspects, that is the (reason) they say: their addiction to drugs and they can't find jobs,' she said.

Her husband, park district interpretation supervisor Jeff Denny, said it is comparable to poor people poaching rare rhinos in Africa to sell their horns. Jobs are hard to come by since the timber and commercial fishing industries went into decline.

'Originally there were two million acres of old growth forest that spanned the coast of Northern California from Oregon to Monterey,' he said.

'Over the past 150 years, 95 percent of that original forest has been cut. The only remaining old growth forest in existence now is almost entirely within the Redwood national park' and some state parks.

A redwood tree can survive the practice, but the legacy of the organism that could be 1,000 years old is threatened, because the burl is where it sprouts a clone before dying.

Sprouting 
from burls is the prevalent method of redwood propagation, and the 
source of the Latin name for coast redwood, Sequoia semper vierens, or 
forever living, he added.

Lorin
 Sandberg is a burl dealer in Scio, Oregon. He occasionally goes to 
Northern California to buy burl, but it is tough to find any more, with 
almost all of the old growth that makes the best burls protected on 
public land. The good stuff with a lacey grain full of eyes will go for 
$2 to $3 a pound, unseasoned.

Finished dining room tables are being offered for $1,300 on eBay.

'I
 don't buy them unless they have proof of where they got it,' he said. 
'I've got to have a paper trail. If there's not a paper trail, it can 
stay in their yard.'

With
 few law enforcement rangers — and 133,000 acres of park stretching 
south from the headquarters in Crescent City, California — to patrol, 
arrests are rare, Laura Denny said. She can recall two or three over the
 past 12 years. While charges can be felonies carrying prison time, 
convictions usually end up as misdemeanors carrying fines.
