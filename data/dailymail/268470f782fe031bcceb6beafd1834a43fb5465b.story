John Coleman, who co-founded the Weather Channel, claims that the belief humans are causing climate change is not backed up by science

Climate change has been proven to be a lie, according to a leading meteorologist.

John Coleman, who co-founded the Weather Channel, claims that the belief humans are causing climate change is not backed up by science.

In an open letter attacking the UN, the 80-year-old from San Diego, said that what 'little evidence' there is for global warming points to  natural cycles in temperature.

'There is no climate crisis,' he wrote. 'The ocean is not rising significantly. The polar ice is increasing, not melting away. Polar bears are increasing in number.

'Heat waves have actually diminished, not increased. There is not an uptick in the number or strength of storms.

'I have studied this topic seriously for years. It has become a political and environment agenda item, but the science is not valid.'

According to The Express, Mr Coleman based his research on the findings of the NIPCC, a non-governmental international body of scientists.

Their role is to offer an second opinion of the evidence reviewed by the UN's International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

'There is no significant man-made global warming at this time, there has been none in the past and there is no reason to fear any in the future,' added Mr Coleman.

'Efforts to prove the theory that carbon dioxide is a significant greenhouse gas and pollutant causing significant warming or weather effects have failed.

'There has been no warming over 18 years.'

Dr Jason Box tweeted this provocative statement after a Swedish study found methane leaking beneath the Arctic

The planet is 'f**cked' after scientists found huge plumes of deadly methane escaping from the seafloor.

This is according to Dr Jason Box who claims that methane will be the main driver of climate change if it escapes into the atmosphere.

He said: 'If even a small fraction of Arctic sea floor carbon is released to the atmosphere, we're f'd'

The scientist, based at the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, tweeted the provocative statement after a Swedish study found methane leaking beneath the Arctic.

Some of this methane – which is over 20 times more potent than CO2 at trapping heat - is now making it to the ocean's surface.

The leaking gas from the seafloor may have its origins in collapsing clusters of methane trapped in frozen water due to high pressure and low temperature.

Scientists at Stockholm University called the discovery 'somewhat of a surprise,' which, according to Dr Box, is an understatement.

'We're on a trajectory to an unmanageable heating scenario, and we need to get off it,' Dr Box told Brian Merchant at Motherboard

'We're f**ked at a certain point, right? It just becomes unmanageable. The climate dragon is being poked, and eventually the dragon becomes pissed off enough to trash the place.'

The IPCC has warned that no one will be untouched by climate change with storm surges, flooding and heatwaves among the key risks.

The report said that violent conflicts, food shortages and serious infrastructure damage were also predicted to become more widespread over the coming years.

It also claimed that the world is in 'an era of man-made climate change' and has already seen impacts of global warming on every continent and across the oceans.

It highlighted that in recent decades, Earth has seen changes in water resources as a result of melting glaciers and differences in rainfall, and reductions in wheat and maize yields.

In the wake of the report's publication there were renewed calls from scientists and campaigners for action to cut greenhouse gases and to help vulnerable people adapt to already-unavoidable impacts of climate change.

In order to minimise the risk of human interference in the climate system, the international community has agreed limit temperature rise to 2°C above pre-industrial levels.

'We live in an era of man-made climate change,' said Vicente Barros, co-chair of the IPCC study on climate change impacts, vulnerabilities and adaptation, from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina.

At the time of the report, one of its contributors has accused the IPCC of being too 'alarmist' – and demanded his name be withdrawn.

Professor Richard Tol, an economist at the University of Sussex, said the drafts had been changed to make the findings more 'apocalyptic'.

He said colleagues 'drifted too far to the alarmist side' and were likening climate change to the 'Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse'.

Projected temperature change from 2081-2100. For the first time, the report connects hotter global temperatures to hotter global tempers. Top scientists are saying that climate change will complicate and worsen existing global security problems, such as civil wars, strife between nations and refugees
