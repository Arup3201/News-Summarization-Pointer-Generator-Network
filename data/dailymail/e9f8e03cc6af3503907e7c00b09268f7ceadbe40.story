Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock is set to escape further punishment from the FA following his rant after Monday night's defeat by Sunderland.

The south London club were denied a clear penalty inside the opening 25 seconds after Santiago Vergini fouled Fraizer Campbell in the box.

Warnock was furious with the decision and let his feeling be known after the clash saying: 'I think everyone knows it's a penalty, the referee says he hasn't seen it, but he is in a great position.

'I think the only chance we have of getting a penalty at the moment is somebody picking the ball up and throwing it at the referee. It's so disappointing when you've played so well.

'Even with the second (penalty appeal) one with Wilfried Zaha. It might be on the edge of the box but they have given a goal kick. It bewilders me.

'We are going to Old Trafford on Saturday, we won't get many decisions there I suppose? On another night, major decisions change games - and in the last couple of weeks we've had major decisions go against us.

'I said to the fourth official: "How does it feel when you see you've made a mistake." He said: "It hurts." So there will be one or two people hurting tonight.

'They (the decisions) get you the points, the assault on Julian Speroni at West Brom when we were 2-0 up and cruising, and Zaha's penalty there. Tonight, you won't get a clearer penalty than that, the defender's just taken his legs.

'You can see it clearly, they should be simple decisions for top class (referees), we are talking about the Premier League - the best in the world - so I don't understand it.

Warnock is already facing an FA charge for his comments about referees after defeat to Chelsea last month

'It's no good speaking to Mike Riley or anything is it? We were told we should appeal more, but I can't see appealing anymore making a difference, can you?'

The FA have been made aware of the comments, but it is understood Warnock will not face disciplinary action.

He is already facing an FA charge following comments made about referee Craig Pawson following the defeat to Chelsea last month.
