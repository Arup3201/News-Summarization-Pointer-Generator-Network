China's internet community has launched an online manhunt to try and track down four thugs who threw a slab of rock at a teenager before urinating on him as he lay defenceless on the floor. 

Shocking images have emerged showing the group slapping, punching and kicking the 13-year-old in a brutal attack which lasted more than five minutes.

Outraged internet users have now joined forces to try and track down the culprits after photos and a video of the attack - which apparently took place in Beijing, China - were posted online.

Police and security officials are also investigating the footage, which was taken down off the internet the following day.

The disturbing video clip and photographs show three youths who are stripped to the waist beating another boy on the head, body and legs.

The video, which was filmed by a fourth person, then shows one boy launching a giant rock at the boy's body.

Photographs also show the attackers urinating on the boy as he lies on the floor, apparently screaming for help.

Shocked web users have now launched a mass online search to try and identify members of the gang who were captured on camera during the attack

The attack is said to have taken place in the Chaoyang District of Beijing. A video documenting the horrific scenes, including the young boy fleeing from his attackers, was uploaded online but was later deleted

Once the images came to light, shocked web users launched a 'mass online search', which they described as a 'human flesh search engine', to identify and expose the individuals responsible.

After trawling the web for leads, some people claimed the attack took place at Naixifang Village.

Web users also identified the youth filming the attack as an eight-grader.

Photos later emerged which showed the injuries that the 13-year-old victim had sustained

Despite pictures showing shocking injuries, officials have refused to say whether the victim is badly hurt, only saying that the investigation is 'open'

The Ministry of Public Security said it had deployed officials to investigate and asked anyone with information to come forward

Officials have also launched an investigation over the images, but have refused to say whether or not the victim is badly hurt.

In a statement, Beijing police said: 'The investigation is open. We do not want to say more at this stage.'

The police did not confirm the allegations which had been made through the online community.

The Ministry of Public Security said it had deployed officials to investigate the photos and video.

A spokesman also asked anyone with information to come forward.
