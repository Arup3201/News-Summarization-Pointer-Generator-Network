A driver had to endure a 30 minute ride of terror with the Boston bombing suspects after he was the victim of a car-jacking.

The hostage, who has not yet been identified, was eventually thrown out the car by the two suspects after the terrifying experience.

His car then became the target of a dramatic police chase which ended with one suspect dead and one police officer seriously injured.

The victim's kidnappers are believed to be brothers from the Russian region of Chechnya - today they were named as Dzhokhar A. Tsarnaev, 19 and his 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan Tzarnaev. 

The man was driving his black Mercedes SUV in Cambridge late last night when he was accosted by the  two armed men.

He was then driven around for half an hour as the pair decided what their next move would be.

As police moved in on the vehicle following reports of a car-jacking, the pair decided to dump the driver at a  gas station on Memorial Drive in Cambridge.

Following this police pursued the pair to Watertown, just west of Cambridge.

Authorities said the chase saw the suspects throw explosive devices from the car and exchanged gunfire with police.

According to eyewitness reports, the two men engaged in a furious gun fight with dozens of police on a backstreet of Watertown.

'During the exchange of the gunfire, we 
believe that one of the suspects was struck and ultimately taken into 
custody,' said a police statement.

A doctor from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center said the suspect died after suffering multiple wounds from gunshots and possibly the blast of an explosive.

'There were signs of more than just gunshot wounds, said the doctor, who did not give his name.

'A second suspect was able to flee from that car and there is an active search going on at this point in time,' Colonel Timothy Alben, superintendent of the Massachusetts State Police, told a news conference.

'What we are looking for right now is a suspect consistent with suspect No 2, the white-capped individual who was involved in Monday's bombing of the Boston Marathon,' Alben said.

The suspects' clashes with police began only a few hours after the FBI released photos and videos of the two young men, who were seen carrying backpacks as they mingled among marathon revelers.

The bombings killed three people and wounded more than 180 others, and authorities revealed the images to enlist the public's help finding the suspects.

The images released by the FBI depict two young men, each wearing a baseball cap, walking one behind the other near the finish line.

Richard DesLauriers, FBI agent in charge in Boston, said the suspect in the white hat, Tsarnaev, was seen setting down a bag at the site of the second of two deadly explosions.

Authorities said surveillance tape recorded late Thursday showed the 'white hat' suspect during a robbery of a convenience store in Cambridge, near the campus of MIT.

Not long after a university police officer died of multiple gunshot wounds  while responding to a report of a disturbance.

A short time later the pair kidnapped the driver who is now being checked over following his traumatic experience.
