LA Kings ice hockey star Slava Voynov has been charged with assaulting his wife.

The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office has filed a felony case against the 24-year-old old who faces a charge of corporal injury to his spouse with great bodily injury.

Voynov was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence in October at a Torrance hospital after bringing his wife, Marta Varlamova, there to seek treatment after he allegedly assaulted her.

Prosecutors said she sustained injuries to her eyebrow, cheek and neck, at their Redondo Beach home, according to the New York Daily News. 

He is scheduled to appear in court on December 1. 

If convicted, Voynov could spend up to nine years in prison. However, he remains determined to prove his innocence.

His lawyer, Craig Renetzky, said in a statement: 'Mr. Voynov is extremely disappointed that the district attorney's office elected to file charges. 

'Mr. Voynov maintains his innocence and looks forward to clearing his name in court. We remain confident.'

An attorney for Mr Voynov's wife has also released a statement, denying his client is a victim and that she believes the injuries were an accident.

The statement reads: 'Marta was stunned by the news today and she is devastated. She did not believe, and does not believe, that her husband intended to injure her and she believes that he is not guilty of any crime. 

'She is worried about her family's privacy and concerned that she and her family are going to be subjected to ridicule, embarrassment and hatred because of this decision. 

'In fact, she has already seen that beginning to happen. 

'It is unfortunate that no one seemed to care what she wants, and that the authorities gave little or no weight to her view of the facts of the case. 

'Despite this unwelcome news, she still expects her husband to be cleared of any criminal wrongdoing.' 

The NHL suspended Voynov indefinitely for the duration of his proceedings and he has not played since October 19. However, he continues to be paid. 

NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said: 'We are aware of actions taken today in California, which we will review and evaluate before making any decisions.

'Until further notice, the current terms of Mr. Voynov's suspension remain in place.' 

Voynov only married Marta Varlamova in August 2014, two months before the alleged assault.

'Not a criminal': Voynov's wife has spoken through her lawyer to say her husband is not guilty and did not hurt her on purpose. 

On announcing Voynov suspension, the NHL cited a section of the collective bargaining agreement saying they have power to suspend a player during a criminal investigation if failing to do so 'would create a substantial risk of material harm to the legitimate interests and/or reputation of the league'.

The NHL's swift response comes in stark contrast to the NFL, which was criticized for failing to appropriately deal with players facing charges, including Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson.

Rice was only suspended for two games from the Baltimore Ravens after he was arrested for hitting his then-fiance in an elevator at a casino in Atlantic City.

But after a website shared a video showing him striking her, the NFL banned him indefinitely and the Ravens released him, amid much public uproar.

Peterson, a running back for the Minnesota Vikings and a former MVP, was also suspended indefinitely with play by his team after he was charged with child abuse in Texas.

He is accused of allegedly whipping his four-year-old son with a tree branch in May.

Voynov's swift suspension also comes a year after the NHL failed to comment or enact a suspension when Colorado Avalanche goaltender Semyon Varlamov was arrested on assault charges. Charges in the case were later dropped.

Last month, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman spoke about his league's domestic violence policy.

He said: 'Our code of conduct is we expect you to do the right things and if you don't we hold you accountable. More important than that is I believe you need to be proactive,' he said. 

'Based on our experience to date, we believe that the appropriate procedures are in effect that we can do what we need to do on a case-by-case basis,' Bettman told The Canadian Press.

'If and when something needs to be addressed in terms of discipline, it will be. But more importantly we try to focus, with the Players' Association, on educating and counselling.'

In June 2013, Voynov and the Kings agreed on a six year, $25 million contract extension. The Russian has two assists in six games this season.
