Rory McIlroy's booming drives helped him birdie both the 17th and 18th holes on Wentworth's West Course to win the BMW PGA Championship last Sunday. But if you thought the Northern Irishman hit the ball a long way you've seen nothing yet.

Former world long drive champion Joe Miller has starred in a remarkable video produced by the European Tour which shows just how easy those two holes can be (providing you blast the ball around 450 yards off the tee).

Yes, that's right: 450 yards. McIlroy is one of the game's biggest hitters but in the cold English air he could perhaps expect to send his best drives 320 yards down the fairway. Miller shows in this video how he can blast his tee shots well over 100 yards longer than arguably the best player in the world.

I've got the power: Miller also demonstrated his huge hitting ability by destroying a watermelon

The real Happy Gilmore: Miller is a former world long drive champion and can hit the ball prodigious distances

Miller can be seen playing both the 17th and 18th holes - the signature par-five, par-five finish at Wentworth - and setting up eagle chances with monstrous drives followed by easy wedge shots into the greens.

Such skills would have come in handy for the likes of Luke Donald, who needed an eagle on the final hole on Sunday to match McIlroy's eventual winning score.

Miller's colossal power is also demonstrated as he drives his golf ball clean through a watermelon placed in front of the tee, exploding the fruit into smithereens.

Big bash: The Northern Irishman is a long hitter but even he needed to take a long iron into the 18th green

You beau-tee: McIlroy hits his drive on the 17th hole - Wentworth's signature par-five - last Sunday 

All of which begs the question: why is Miller not a tour player if he can make things looks so easy?

Well, thankfully for McIlroy and Co, golf is about more than just blasting the ball into oblivion. There's also the small matter of iron play, chipping and putting to think about - not to mention bunkers - as well as being able to perform in front of a huge audience.

But while Miller is not a good enough all-round player to match the likes of McIlroy, he can still have fun smashing his ball around the globe.

Long drive is a growing element of golf, earning popularity in the United States in particular. At 6ft 4in and 19 stone, the 30-year-old Miller is one of its highest profile names. 

It's just a shame we don't get to see his putts...
