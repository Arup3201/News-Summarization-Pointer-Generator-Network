Dawn Chedd, 50, pictured outside court, was convicted of causing death by careless driving after her car shot backwards out of a car park space and killed a pensioner

A childminder has been convicted of causing death by careless driving after she left the handbrake off her automatic car and it shot backwards out of a car park space and killed a pensioner.

Dawn Chedd, 50, had failed to apply the brake to her Vauxhall Zafira and had left it in reverse gear after a shopping trip to the Bluewater Shopping Centre at Greenhithe, Kent.

The car reversed from the bay at a speed of between 15 and 20mph in a tight arc, colliding with four parked vehicles before it ran over 71-year-old Claire Bishop, who lived in Romney Gardens, Bexleyheath.

Chedd was convicted by a jury at Maidstone Crown Court after a week-long trial and will be sentenced on July 15.

Chedd,
of Swanley, Kent, had parked her automatic Vauxhall Zafira in a bay in 
level one of the blue area car park at Bluewater on January 4 last year,
with a friend's two-year-old child in the back

The court heard prosecution claims that she'd hit the accelerator instead of the brake.

The driver's door was open at the time and Chedd ended up face-down on the floor having fallen from the driver's seat.

Mrs
Bishop had been on a three-hour shopping spree with her husband Roy and
was walking back to her car at the time of the fatal incident.

She
suffered serious injuries after becoming partially trapped under the 
car in a pool of her own blood and died in King's College Hospital in 
London at 8.40am on January 9.

Chedd
denied the charge of causing death by careless or inconsiderate driving
but it took jurors less than an hour to find her guilty following a 
one-week trial at Maidstone Crown Court.

Following the verdict, Mrs Bishop's family paid tribute to 'a loving wife, mum and nana'.

A statement released by her family said: 'She is dearly missed by her family and her many friends, who she loved to have around her.'

During the trial, the jury of seven men and five women heard how Chedd - who has been driving since the age of 17 and says she has never even had a parking ticket - claimed she fainted and did not remember any of the incident.

Giving evidence in court, she said: 'I was like a rock; like it wasn't me; like I wasn't there.

'It was like an out of body experience and I was shaking all over like I was lifting off the floor and I couldn't see anything or hear anything.

'I thought I was dead to be honest. I would not have driven carelessly on that day. I'm sorry that someone lost their life.'

Claire Bishop, 71, who lived in Romney Gardens, Bexleyheath, was run over as she walked back to her car

Maidstone Crown Court heard Mrs Bishop had been on a three-hour shopping spree with her husband Roy and was walking back to her car at the time of the fatal incident

But prosecutor Catherine Donnelly hit back at Chedd's claims, saying: 'What happened was you were very careless that day and you must have put your foot down on the accelerator rather than the brake.'

Speaking after the trial, investigating officer PC Glen Braidwood said: 'This was an extremely tragic case in which a number of errors led to an innocent bystander losing her life.

'It underlines the importance of driving with due care and attention at all times - not just when behind the wheel but when entering or exiting a vehicle.

'We will never know why Chedd did not use her handbrake or why she left the gearbox engaged in reverse. Losing focus for just a second led to a catastrophic series of events in which Mrs Bishop died and Chedd was left injured.

'That momentary error has had an immeasurable impact on a number of lives, Chedd's included.

He added: 'I'd like to praise Mrs Bishop's family for their strength and courage in reliving those terrible events and speak for all of Kent Police when I say that our thoughts are with them as they try to come to terms with this tragedy.

'I hope today's result can bring them a measure of closure as they try to move on with their lives without Claire.'

Chedd will be sentenced at the same court on July 15.
