Bernard Cazeneuve, the French interior minister, said the presence of British officers would persuade immigrants it was 'impossible to cross the Channel'

A French minister has called for Britain send police to Calais to deal with the port's 'tremendous problem' with illegal immigration.

Bernard Cazeneuve, the French interior minister, said the presence of British officers would persuade immigrants it was 'impossible to cross the Channel'.

Growing numbers of migrants have been trying to enter the UK through Calais in recent months. There are now 2,500 illegal immigrants in the port. 

Last month the mayor of the ferry port said migrants were attracted to Britain because they saw it as an 'El Dorado' of generous welfare.

British taxpayers will be contributing to a new £2.35 million a year welcome centre for UK-bound illegal migrants in Calais, it emerged yesterday.

The bill will be added to the £12million the British government has already pledged to the French to improve security in the port town this year. 

The demand for even more help - including the stationing of UK police in the French port - will cause anger and a demand for the French government to do more.

Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live's Breakfast Show, Mr Cazeneuve said: 'We had a hard negotiation between the two governments and I have had a lots of rendezvous with my friend Theresa May in order to find a solution concerning this tremendous problem.

'We are both involved in this problem and we have to find common solutions in order to be efficient.'

He said he and Mrs May had agreed that, in order to tackle the problem in both countries, more co-operation was needed in 'services and policemen'.

Local officials say there are now 2,500 illegal immigrants in Calais, with the majority from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Sudan and Syria.

Numbers have increased by 50 per cent in the past year as people flee from humanitarian crises in northern and eastern Africa and the Middle East.

Many are camping or living in squats around the port and there have been clashes on the streets of the town.

Last month, France sent 100 extra police officers to the northern French town to join the 350 already there. There are currently no British police there.

Mr Cazeneuve said that he and Mrs May had agreed to the installation of new security equipment at the port, and to 'try to work together concerning the security aspects and the humanitarian aspects by financing a number of projects'.

'We are going to finance the humanitarian aspect and the British government is going to help with financing the security aspect of the problem,' he added.

When asked if he believed British police should be sent to Calais, Mr Cazeneuve said: 'It would be very useful to have more policemen here, and we try to find a way of being in a common system here concerning police, in order to explain to all the immigrants in Calais that it's impossible to cross the Channel.

'And we'd be very happy if it would be possible to have more co-operation concerning this point.'

The UK has said it will contribute £4million a year for three years to a joint intervention fund.

The increased security measures are said to include more robust fences and new technology to detect migrants hiding in lorries.

During a visit to Calais on Monday, Mr Cazeneuve signed an agreement to ensure the new facility will be open by January.

But aid groups warned the centre could turn into an expensive 'ghetto' that will become a magnet for thousands more asylum seekers who want to make the journey across the English Channel.

Mr Cazeneuve said the centre will have 'a budget of more than three million euros a year, which the state will be asking the European Union for.'

Britain pays more than £8billion a year to the EU, meaning UK money will certainly end up being used to welcome the migrants to Calais, who currently number around 2,500.

Mayor Bouchart said the migrants were willing to risk death to cross the English Channel

The migrants have been living in make-shift camps near the ferry port in north-eastern France 

Campaigners fear that a new planned camp in Calais could quickly turn into a 'ghetto' 

Mr Cazeneuve said the centre will be housed in a collection of prefabricated buildings close to the docks, where migrants try to get on lorries every day.

The facility will serve at least 1,500 meals a day, and provide heating toilets and showers as well as beds for the most vulnerable.

Calais' mayor Natacha Bouchart told MPs last week that Britain was seen as an ‘El Dorado’ for migrants – and many were prepared to die to make the journey.

Blaming the UK for the crisis, Miss Bouchart said lavish benefits and the prospect of illegal work and accommodation were magnets for immigrants determined to get across the English Channel.

She said illegal migrants, many fleeing humanitarian disasters in Africa and the Middle East, were ‘prepared to die’ to reach Britain, believing it to be like the mythical lost city of gold, El Dorado.

Giving evidence to the Commons home affairs select committee, she said: ‘The real magnet is not the city of Calais but the benefits that are perceived in Great Britain.

‘The weekly benefits of £36 that are given to migrants or asylum seekers is a huge amount for people who have nothing in their lives.

‘They have no idea about the value of money … But they know from those people who have got through [to Britain] that … they can easily find work, don’t have to declare their work, they can find accommodation and can get some money every week. People who have got through call and say, “ … this is El Dorado and we’re staying here”.’
