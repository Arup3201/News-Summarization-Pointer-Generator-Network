Heavy snow has turned   New England into a frozen winter wonderland, but the icicles and ice dams taking over local buildings are also a dangerous threat.

Portland, Maine resident Adam Sousa had his car wrecked this weekend by falling ice that shattered the windows, dented the body and caved in the bumper. 

Luckily the 28-year-old wasn't in the car at the time, since a 3-foot-long ice chunk smashed through the windshield and landed right between the driver and passenger seats. He says the ice chunk was so heavy, both he and a tow truck driver struggled to move it together.

Shattered glass: A resident in Portland, Maine had his car wrecked on Sunday when it was struck by falling ice in the Old Port part of town

Look up: The huge chunks of 3-foot-long ice, some weighing more than 100 pounds, hit 28-year-old Adam Sousa's car, seen parked above 

Out of luck: Sousa's liability insurance doesn't cover the cost to fix his 2003 Chevrolet Cavalier. He is now working with the building's owner Joseph Soley to see if that man's insurance will help fix the car 

'I thought maybe an icicle would fall off, not a whole car-size piece of ice,' Mr Sousa told WMTW of his expectations parking his 2003 Chevy Cavalier outside the building on Sunday.  

Mr Sousa dropped his car off in the morning, took the bus to Freeport and then returned in the afternoon to find the startling damage.

Unfortunately, his liability insurance doesn't cover the cost to fix his car and the city can't help either. 

'What they told me when I spoke to the police is that they can't really do much, because it's an act of nature. But from what I saw, the size of those ice chunks, they're a 100- 150-pound ice chunks,' Mr Sousa said. 

However, he has contacted the building's owner, Joseph Soley, who is looking into whether his insurance might cover the cost of repairs. 

Mr Sousa told  the Press-Herald that he talked to Mr Soley on Tuesday afternoon and that their conversation was friendly.

Wrecked: Falling ice chunks shattered several windows on Mr Sousa's car and banged up much of the body 

Rule breaking: It's a violation of Portland city ordinance to leave dangerous icicles and ice dams on buildings 

'He said he would contact his insurance and he seemed very nice about it,' Mr Sousa said. 'He did ask why I didn’t park somewhere else.'

On Monday, the city investigated and determined that Mr Soley had violated a city ordinance against dangerous ice and snow buildup.

Building owners are required to clean up such threatening ice, and if not, they can be fined up to $250. 

City officials say Mr Soley will not face any sort of criminal charges. 

'When that ice dam is noticed, or obviously presents a hazard, they're required to mitigate that hazard.' Tim Nangle of Portland Fire and EMS said. 

Time of need: Friends have been helping drive Mr Sousa to and from his job as a bartender at a local restaurant and a GoFundMe campaign has already raised over $3,000 for Mr Sousa's expenses 

However, Mr Nangle added that sometimes there are logistical challenges to keeping building owners from cleaning the dangerous ice in winter -  such as the demand for workers to scrape the ice across the city.

Still, Mr Nangle says he's never seen damage to a car as bad as what happened to Mr Sousa.  

'It really was a significant chunk of ice that went through the windshield,' Mr Nangle told WCSH. 'I was surprised and actually glad that there was no one in the car.'

In the meantime, friends have been driving Mr Sousa to and from his job as a bartender at DiMillo's Restaurant & Lounge, and he has encountered even more support through a crowd-funding campaign that has already raised over $3,000 dollars. 

The U.S. Bartenders Guild has also offered to host a fundraiser for Mr Sousa. 

'The amount of help that everybody has been putting forth is just unbelievable,' Mr Sousa said.
