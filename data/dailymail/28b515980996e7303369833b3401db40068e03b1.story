A life insurance company has asked an Oklahoma judge to decide whether they should be forced to hand over $20,000 to a teen accused of murdering his entire family in order to cash in on the policy.

Deeply indebted, self-proclaimed shopaholic Alan Hruby, 19, confessed he gunned down his mother, father and sister in October in the hope of paying off a $3,000 loan shark debt.

As Hruby faces a potential death penalty, American Fidelity Assurance Co. this week petitioned a judge to disqualify him from receiving the policy proceeds policy say he was desperate enough to slay his for.

Confessed: An insurance company is fighting a life insurance pay-out to Alan Hruby, who confessed in October to shooting dead his mother, father and sister in order to become the sole inheritor of the estate

The company says it can deny Hruby the money because of his alleged role in his family members' death, but needs the judge's approval. 

The pay out would come from two American Fidelity policies held by Hruby's rural newspaper publisher father, NewsOK reports.

His father, John Hruby, named his wife Tinker as the main beneficiary. In the event of her death, the money was to go to Alan and his little sister Katherine Hruby, 17.

Authorities say Hruby admitted he murdered his family to become the sole heir after he was cut off by them financially.

The insurance company asked Stephens County Associate District Judge Brent Russell to decide whether or not they must pay out the policy.

Slain: His father, John Hruby, named his wife Tinker as the main beneficiary. In the event of her death, the money was to go to Alan and his little sister Katherine Hruby, 17.

Without the petition, the company says it will be forced to make good on the payment despite Hruby's confession.

Prosecutors in Duncan filed three charges of first-degree murder against University of Oklahoma student Alan Hruby, 19, in the killings of his father, John, 50; mother, Tinker, 48; and his sister in October.

Stephens County District Attorney Jason Hicks said Hruby owned money to a loan shark. Hicks did not say why Hruby had so much debt, only that his spending was out of control.

'The reason we were given for the murders was that he was having financial difficulties,' Hicks said at a news conference in Duncan. 'He felt if he murdered (his family) he would be the only heir to the estate.'

Hicks said Hruby shot his mother and father twice each and his sister once. He later left the family's house and disposed of the gun and disc from a home security system. Hruby then traveled to Dallas for the weekend, where he stayed at the upscale Ritz-Carlton hotel, Hicks said.

Hicks said Alan Hruby acted 'very nonchalant' and 'cold and callous' when he arrived at the home where the bodies of his parents were discovered by the family's housekeeper Monday.

'I tend to think this is a very heinous and atrocious crime,' Hicks said. 'This shows the fact there was no remorse; this shows this was an evil person.

'Any tears that were shed (by Alan) were crocodile tears,' he said

John Hruby was the publisher of The Marlow Review, a weekly newspaper with a circulation of about 3,500. His wife also worked at the paper.

Hruby was also publisher of The Duncan Banner until 1997, when his family sold that paper, and was vice president of the Oklahoma Newspaper Foundation Board of Trustees, a part of the Oklahoma Press Association. 

Hruby's social media posts would routinely boast of his expensive lifestyle

He made a hobby out of posing for photos with expensive cars

Hruby also liked to show off his expensive purchases, sometimes in front of international landmarks for a classy touch, like this pic of an Omega watch in front of the Eiffel Tower
