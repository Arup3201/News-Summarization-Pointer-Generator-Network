It’s one of the nation’s hottest export success stories – hundreds of tons of chillies grown on British farms are being sold to countries renowned for their fiery cuisine.

Already this year, well over 600 tons of chillies produced by UK growers have been exported to countries that include Pakistan, India, Mexico and Brazil.

This year’s chilli exports are expected to be double last year’s, bringing £1.3million into the economy, according to official figures.

Burning ambition: Grower Gerald Fowler tends to his super-fiery chilli crop

Gerald Fowler, who runs the Chilli Pepper Company in Cark-in-Cartmel, Cumbria, said: ‘It’s gone crazy and I’m selling to every corner of the Earth. I’d never have believed I’d be selling to India, Pakistan, Mexico, Brazil and America.

‘It’s going to be our best year ever. We are selling seeds and chillies and all they want is the hottest. No one is interested in a mild chilli.’

The growth in the popularity of spicy foods in the UK has prompted growers to experiment with different varieties, creating some of the hottest and most sought-after chillies in the world. At the Conservative conference last week, Mayor of London Boris Johnson praised British ingenuity for growing ‘weapon-strength chillies’.

And Environment Secretary Elizabeth Truss told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Chefs from Delhi to Texas are reaching for British chillies to put the spice into their curries and their Tex-Mex. It’s an extraordinary testament to the skill, creativity and can-do attitude that make our food and farming industry world-leading.

‘People may not think of chillies as a traditional British crop, but it’s increasingly hot business. This is fantastic news and it’s further proof of the reputation British producers are gaining around the world for high quality and innovation.’

The Chilli Pepper Company was started by Mr Fowler’s father 20 years ago from one chilli grown in a pot, and today makes £250,000 a year in a business based around a tiny 16ft by 8ft greenhouse. ‘I think chilli is the new garlic,’ said Mr Fowler. ‘Chefs are helping to make it popular and they are putting it in all of their concoctions.

‘We’ve also being helped by the internet. When we first started, people sent postal orders and cheques in the post to buy a plant. Now, it’s online orders. We’ve expanded and employ five people here and another ten people grow chillies for us around the country.’

The firm gained an international reputation in 2010 when its Naga Viper chilli pepper was judged the hottest in the world.

The record-breaking chilli scored 1.35 million units on the Scoville heat unit scale (Shus). This measures the heat of a chilli by the presence of the chemical compound capsaicin. It has now been replaced as the world’s hottest chilli by the Carolina Reaper, grown in the US, which scores 1.5 million Shus.

‘We’re hoping to beat that,’ Mr Fowler said. ‘I’m trialling a cross between a Carolina Reaper and a Naga Viper, but the project is going to take another two or three years.’

Meanwhile, the Dorset Naga is ranked as the world’s third hottest chilli. It was developed by Joy and Michael Michaud, who run Sea Spring Seeds, near Bridport.

Mrs Michaud said: ‘We sell online and our chillies and seeds are sent all over the world, particularly to South America.

‘It has really taken off.’
