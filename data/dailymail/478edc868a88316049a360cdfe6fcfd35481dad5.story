They were out there somewhere enjoying the Welsh countryside, snuffling about in the valley perhaps or snoozing in the woods.

The pack of 23 wild boars which were let loose by burglars during a break in at a farm were quite possibly feeling as happy a pig in the proverbial yesterday.

But the same could not be said of residents of the nearest town, Maesteg, near Bridgend, South Wales, who were anxiously awaiting for the beasts to be recaptured - as police warned they may charge anyone who approaches them.

Warning: Greg Davies, owner of Cwmfelin boar farm in Bridgend, South Wales, lost 23 after a break-in last night

Brutal: Several of the animals were mutilated by the burglars in the overnight raid near Maesteg town

‘I don’t think I’d want to get that close in the first place really,’ said Michelle Reid, 46, as she tucked into a fry-up in the Valley Café.

‘At least they haven’t decided to have a look round the shops today.’

Her sentiments were shared by an elderly woman out for a stroll. ‘I hope I don’t find one in my garden,’ she said.

‘They are vicious little things. I’d run if I saw one.’

As police and local farmers searched for the boars yesterday, Inspector Paul Thomas of South Wales Police said: ‘They may charge anyone who tries to approach them as the boars will be disorientated, confused and are not used to being out of their pens.

Police are hunting the pack of 23 let loose into the Welsh valleys, which require a dangerous animals licence

Several of the 110-strong herd were found with cut throats or had their heads battered with a hammer

‘These animals are recognised as posing a potential threat. People should take as much care as possible. We are investigating the criminal damage and the release of dangerous wild animals, which can carry a sentence in prison.’

The owner of the farm, Greg Davies, 46, holds a dangerous animals licence and had the necessary fencing in place to prevent escapes. He advised farmers to shoot the boars on sight if they are spotted.

He said he lost 23 adults boars and 19 boarlets out of his 110-strong herd when his isolated farm a couple of miles from the town centre was raided by burglars.

Several others were found dead with throats cut and heads battered with a hammer.

Mr Davies said: ‘They are dangerous animals and should not be approached.

Six people were arrested yesterday as the search continued for the missing 23. The rest of the pack is pictured

Mr Davies could see 70 or 80 of the animals running around the land when he arrived in the morning

‘They will attack if they smell blood. Farmers with new lambs in their fields need to keep their eyes open for the boars. I’m advising them to shoot them straight away. They are carrion animals and will attack.’

Six people were yesterday arrested after the boars were freed, police said.

Mr Davies said: ‘When I arrived at the farm on Sunday morning I could see 70 or 80 of them running around. The gate had been cut and they were released from their pen. It was very worrying.

‘We rounded up as many as we could and I’ve only just been able to establish how many are missing. I reckon it is 23 adults and 19 boarlets unaccounted for.’

He has been breeding the boars for six years with an adult fetching £350 to £400 - and also supplying specialist restaurants and delis as far away as Sussex and Scotland.

The raiders also took almost £10,000 of mechanical and electrical gear from the farm

The raiders also took more than £10,000 in mechanical and electrical gear, Mr Davies said.

Wild boars are usually nocturnal, foraging in early morning or late afternoon and evening, and can travel up to 30 miles a day looking for food.

They have even been known to charge at cars, damaging grilles and bodywork.

But naturalist and BBC broadcaster Iolo Williams, the patron of the Wild Boar Trust said: ‘They’re fantastic animals, fascinating things. They have a bad reputation and I don’t understand why.

‘They are very secretive, they are very shy and probably the first thing they’ll do is they’ll head for woodland cover. There’s quite a bit of woodland in the Maesteg area - I’m pretty sure that’s where people will find most of them.’
