SAC Capital Advisors, one of Wall Street’s largest and most successful hedge funds, was indicted Thursday on potentially crippling charges it played a major role in the largest insider trading scheme the industry has ever seen.

The charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission accuse the Stamford, Connecticut-based fund with wire fraud and four counts of securities fraud that amount to ‘hundreds of millions’ made illegally over a decade, according to the filing.

Papers filed in Manhattan federal court are seeking forfeiture of ‘any and all’ assets still owned by the company started by billionaire Steven Cohen and that once managed $15 billion.

'Without any known precedent': Preet Bharara, United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York said the scope of SAC Capital's misdeeds is vast and said the fund had 'zero tolerance for low returns'

Smiling now? SAC's billionaire founder Steven Cohen, one of America's richest men, has taken a series of blows recently including a $600 million penalty slapped on his company by the SEC in March

The indictment hits Cohen’s company after a series of blows. SAC was slapped with a $600 million penalty by the SEC in March.

Cohen
is one of the highest profile figures in American finance and one of 
the richest men in America. He is among the handful of upper-tier hedge 
fund managers on Wall Street who pull in about $1 billion a year in 
compensation.

A
former employee of SAC Capital Advisors' Chicago office, Richard Lee, 
was also charged individually by the SEC this week. That makes six 
former SAC employees who’ve pleaded guilty or been convicted of insider 
trading.

The company 
will also go to court bereft of some $8 billion that has been pulled out
of the fund by clients this year in the wake of its targeting by the 
feds.

Back off: A security guard tries to block the view of the SAC sign outside its Stamford, Connecticut headquarters Thursday after a federal court indicted the hedge fund on insider trading charges

Accused: SAC's Stamford, Connecticut headquarters. Federal prosecutors on Thursday unveiled criminal fraud charges against billionaire Steven A. Cohen's fund that once managed $15 billion

Prosecutors alleged the crimes were carried out from 1999 through at least 2010.

For
his part, Lee is accused of having once been part of an ‘insider 
trading group’ at a rival hedge fund, according to an indictment filed 
on Thursday against SAC.

The
charges allege Lee moved from a firm identified only as ‘Hedge Fund A’ 
to SAC, despite a warning that Lee ‘was known for being part of Hedge 
Fund A's “insider trading group.”’

Lee agreed this week to plead guilty to securities fraud charges and to cooperate with government investigators.

SAC Capital, owned by once of America's richest men Steven Cohen, was indicted on insider trading charges July 25. The hedge fund once managed $15 billion and ranked among the largest funds in the U.S.

The SEC alleges SAC Capital:

A spokesman for SAC Capital was not immediately available to comment on Thursday.

In
a statement, FBI Assistant Director George Venizelos said: ‘SAC Capital
and its management fostered a culture of permissiveness. SAC not only 
tolerated cheating, it encouraged it.’

U.S.
Attorney Preet Bharara said at a news conference that the firm had 
‘zero tolerance for low returns, but seemingly tremendous tolerance 
conduct for questionable conduct.’

Bharara also said the federal government intends to be ‘mindful to minimize risk to third-party investors.’

In court papers, the government did not identify Cohen by name but blasted the ‘SAC owner,’ saying he purposely tried to hire portfolio managers and analysts who knew employees of public companies likely to possess inside information.

The government said he ‘enabled and promoted the insider trading scheme by ignoring indications that trading recommendations were based on inside information’ and failed to question new employee candidates who implied their trading advantage was based on sources of inside information.

It said Cohen fostered ‘a culture that focused on not discussing inside information too openly, rather than not seeking or trading on such information in the first place.’

SAC's ‘relentless pursuit of an information `edge' fostered a business culture within SAC in which there was no meaningful commitment to ensure that such `edge' came from legitimate research and not inside information," the criminal charges said.

It added: ‘The predictable and foreseeable result, as charged herein, was systematic insider trading by the SAC entity defendants resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars of illegal profits and avoided losses at the expense of members of the investing public.’
