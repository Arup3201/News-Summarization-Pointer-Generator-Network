The Easter bunny was invented in German folklore, where an 'Easter Hare' was used to determine whether children had been well-behaved.

Much like Father Christmas, the brown-coloured animals was often depicted carrying a selection of treats to good children's houses.

But while the traditional version of the rabbit was a natural-looking creature, the modern character has become an often terrifying white, pink, purple and yellow creation. 

The Easter bunny is meant to be a joyful character, but often botched costumes mean they are more horrific than happy, as this picture demonstrates 

The symbol of the Easter often results in a terrifying sight when produced on a budget. 

Children who would usually be delighted to be meeting someone who will be gifting them with chocolate eggs end up screaming for their parents. 

As reported by Metro, unfortunate humans who have been given the task of dressing up as the rabbit end up looking more like the terrifying Donnie Darko character than a friendly furball.
