'Lovely character': Schoolboy Daniel Spargo-Mabbs was just 16 when he died after taking ecstasy at a warehouse rave

The heartbroken father of a teenager who died at a rave after taking a lethal dose of ecstasy today told an inquest of his ‘unspeakable’ loss.

Daniel Spargo-Mabbs, 16, fell unconscious after taking a lethal dose of the Class A party drug with his friends at a warehouse party in Hayes, west London.

The teenager and his friends had clubbed together to buy £80 worth of the drug, and were supplied by Nicqueel Pitrora on January 17 last year.

Known as ‘Shampz’ to the schoolboys, Pitrora, 19, was a regular dealer to children and used their payments to supplement his benefits

On their way to the rave, Daniel and four friends  met a man on a bike who handed them three bags of white powder after the deal had been arranged with Pitrora.

Four of the boys, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, dissolved the drug in 100ml bottles of water while using public transport to reach Silverdale Industrial Estate for the rave.

But Daniel sprinkled around half a gramme of the crystalline powder into 500ml of water and drank it in one go once inside the warehouse.

Shortly afterwards, the teenager took his shirt off, became animated about his girlfriend and started to dance.

But by 4am, his temperature had soared and he collapsed to the ground. Daniel was rushed to nearby Hillingdon hospital by paramedics but nothing could be done to save him.

His multi-organ failure became so severe that doctors considered lower limb amputation, but by the morning of January 20, doctors admitted their attempts at helping Daniel were becoming more and more futile.

After consultation with Daniel’s family, a decision was made to turn off his life support machine and he was pronounced dead at 2.36pm at King’s College Hospital, where he had been transferred.

His devastated father Tim today told West London Coroner’s Court that the Daniel Spargo-Mabbs Foundation had been set up in his memory to educate young people about the dangers of taking illegal drugs.

Mr Spargo-Mabbs said: ‘We have seen the sort of hole a death like this leaves - we have lived it for a year.

‘And in response all we can find to do is offer ourselves in the service of the charitable foundation trying to prevent this happening to any other family.’

Mr Spargo-Mabbs said his son had led ‘such a good life’ and was a ‘lovely and outrageous character.’

He added: ‘He had a lot to teach me about how to live life well and take every opportunity, and to have a laugh in almost every situation.

‘There is no verbalising the loss we all feel and no end to the pain that his death leaves us with.

‘What there is, however, is the determination shared by his family, school, friends and church, to prevent this happening to anybody else, and that is the best we can pray for now.’

He added his ‘undying thanks’ to all those who had treated Daniel and supported the family.

Popular Daniel was a member of Amnesty International and was known to run errands for pensioners on his paper round. 

Coroner Sarah Ormond-Walshe recorded his death as multi-organ failure and MDMA toxicity, which was ‘wholly in keeping’ with taking the drug.

She said: ‘The tragic facts are that this is a young man, a teenager, who has attended a rave on the 17/18 January 2014.

‘He has taken MDMA - we know that this was a dose that was fatal.

‘He was found in a semi-collapsed state and taken by ambulance first to the Hillingdon Hospital.

‘The doctors, the nurses, the healthcare professionals tried in order to pull out every single stop to save him.’

Supplier: Nicqueel Pitrora was jailed for five years for supplying class A drugs last August

Pitrora, of London Road, Croydon, was jailed for five years in August last year for supplying Class A drugs. 

Ms Ormond-Walshe went on to praise both hospitals and the police for all their work.

She said a desperate last attempt was made to transfer him to Kings College to save him, and doctors used the ‘most aggressive therapy’ available.

She added: ‘He just could not be saved - he was too ill. The amount of MDMA in his blood was a fatal level, and that was the problem.

‘He was a fit and well 16-year-old who collapsed at a rave in a warehouse at the back of an industrial estate after having taken MDMA.

‘I have been very, very impressed with not only how courageous and positive the family have been but how much dignity the family have had after Daniel’s death, and how they have turned it into positive thinking in these devastating circumstances.

‘I have also been very impressed by what they are doing in relation to the Daniel Spargo-Mabbs Foundation.

‘It is such an insightful and positive and realistic notion that the family are taking forward.

‘I am minded to write an open letter to the foundation setting out some of the facts of Daniel’s case and how much I support the education of teenagers in relation to illegal drugs.'
