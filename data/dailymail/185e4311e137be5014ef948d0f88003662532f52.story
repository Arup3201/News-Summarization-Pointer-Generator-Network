A 22-year-old graduate has died after his car plunged into a canal off the Hudson River in Jersey City in the early hours of New Year’s Day.

Marc Pych was unresponsive when he was pulled from the water at around 3:30 a.m., about two hours after he crashed through a steel barrier and drove off a New Jersey parking lot and into the water.

Pych, who had just graduated from Rutgers University last week with a degree in finance, was pronounced dead at hospital. He had been due to start searching for a job in the new year.

Accident or suicide? Marc Pych, 22, died in the early hours of New Year's Day after the car he was driving crashed through a steel barrier and ended up in a canal off the Hudson River in New Jersey

His weeping mother and sister watched the car being dragged from the waters at about 9 a.m. on Wednesday.

‘He never had an accident,’ a distraught Maria Pych, Marc’s mother, told the Daily News. ‘He was very quiet, a very good boy, no problems. No smoking, no drinking. To me, he was everything.’

Pych had gone on New Year's Eve at about 9 p.m. to celebrate the new year and had been celebrating at a bar just a few blocks from the water.

According to his 17-year-old sister, Bernadette, the siblings had been playing video games on Tuesday night before he left to meet friends.

‘Maybe he was drunk or something,’ she told the Daily News. ‘I have no idea how his car went into the water. He wouldn’t just drive into the water. He was an excellent driver.’

Police believe Pych was the only person in the car, but crews are continuing to search the canal for additional passengers because a witness initially reported that two or three people were inside the vehicle.

A parking attendant reported the car speeding out of the parking lot and seconds later hitting the water and then sinking quickly.

The plunge is being investigated as an accident, police say. The Hudson River is about 40 degrees this time of year.
