A teenager has used pieces of Lego to replicate models of Hitler and scenes of the Holocaust as part of a Second World War school history project.

The 16-year-old pupil, from St Helens, Merseyside, decided to use the toy pieces to build a timeline of events of the war, instead of creating a simple poster.

Upon finishing his creation, which was part of a GCSE history project, he uploaded a photograph of it to Reddit, where it has received more than 250,000 views and 1,000 comments.

The 16-year-old pupil, from St Helens, Merseyside decided to use Lego to build a timeline of events of the Second World War, instead of creating a poster, for a GCSE history project to 'remember the holocaust'

The unique Lego creation depicts various key events in the Holocaust and the rise and fall of Hitler and the Nazis. It starts in January 1933 with a depiction of Adolf Hitler being appointed the Chancellor of Germany

Upon finishing his creation, the teenager uploaded a photograph of it to Reddit, where it has since received more than 250,000 views and 1,000 comments. Pictured: Hitler is given emergency powers in February 1933

Of his creation, the pupil said: 'As I'm not a very good drawer I thought why not do something I'm good at?'

The student, who wished to remain anonymous, said the response had been overwhelming.

He said: 'My history teacher set us a task to create something that will help people remember the Holocaust, as every history GCSE student in the country has to study it.

'I decided not to make a poster, but to make a timeline of events. This would help me to remember the dates better.

'As I'm not a very good drawer I thought why not do something I'm good at?'

The Lego creation depicts various key events in the Holocaust and the rise and fall of Hitler and the Nazis.

The timeline starts in January 1933 with a picture showing Adolf Hitler being appointed as Chancellor of Germany.

He stands in front of a crowd of people with a Swastika behind him made out of red and white Lego bricks.

This is followed by a scene from February 1933 which has the caption '40,000 SS and SAS men are sworn in as auxiliary police'.

Another scene is captioned: 'The Reichstag is burned, probably by the Nazis'.

Among other pieces in his unique creation are a depiction of the D-Day landings and the opening of Auschwitz.

Upon finishing his creation, which was part of a GCSE school history project, the teenager uploaded a photograph of it to Reddit, where it has since received more than 250,000 views and 1,000 comments 

He said his Lego project 'helped him remember dates of the war'. Pictured: Germany invading Poland in 1939

The boy's headteacher said his work had not yet been formally assessed but said the school was impressed with his 'Lego building' skills and the time he committed to the project. His work will be marked in due course

The timeline ends with a Lego model of Hitler lying on a Swastika with the caption: 'Hitler commits suicide'.

The pupil has also included a photograph alongside his creation, showing the desk he used while piecing together all of the Lego scenes.

After completing it, he uploaded it to online site Reddit with the heading: 'I made a Lego timeline of the Holocaust for a school history project.' It quickly prompted more than 1,000 comments and hundreds of thousands of views.

He said: 'I'm pretty overwhelmed by the reaction online; there's been a huge variance in what people think about it.

'Usually my photos and creations get a few hundred views, so it was certainly a surprise to wake up to 275,000 views.'

The boy's headteacher said his work had not yet been formally assessed but added: 'In response to a GCSE class research question about the need to remember the Holocaust, the pupil, uniquely among his peers, chose to employ his passion for Lego to create a detailed visual timeline of the events which led up to and made possible the persecution of millions.

'His teacher has seen photographs of his hard work and is duly impressed by his Lego building skills and the time he has committed to the project.

'The quality of the research underpinning the visual representations, which will form the basis of the mark for the work, has not been assessed yet.'
