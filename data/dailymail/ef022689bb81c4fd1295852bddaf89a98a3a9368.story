Former Everton goalkeeper Neville Southall has encouraged manager Roberto Martinez to stick to his footballing principles against Liverpool on Saturday and not set up his team to defend.

Martinez's side have endured a tough start to the Premier League season, and are in 14th place  having won just one of their first five games.

But Southall is adamant that his old club must take the game to the Reds, as they go after their first win at Anfield in 15 years.

The Welshman says it's crucial Roberto Martinez does not abandon his attacking principles at Anfield 

The 56-year-old former stopper said on the Paddy Power Blog: 'It's important that the players – and the fans – keep the faith with Roberto Martinez's principles and we go out there on Saturday against Liverpool and attack.

'We've had enough years of damage limitation at the club. I'd sooner us have a go and get beat 6-3 trying to win the game (like we did against Chelsea) than 'manage' a result when you go a goal down.

'Sometimes you've just got to play yourself out of a difficult patch. I'd be worried if the Toffees were putting in poor team performances. 

'But recent results have been more down to individual errors. A result against our biggest rival would be a massive confidence boost.'
