A series of incredible pictures show delicate insects perching on tiny rain droplets in the morning dew.

Bertrand Kulik, 34, a concert violinist and keen photographer from Paris, took the stunning close-up images of the resting bugs in a park in Burgundy.

The photographer, who has been taking pictures for ten years, uses a special lens to take his macro pictures, so he can capture the perfect detail on the tiny insects.

The stunning series of photographs captures the beauty of reflections from the raindrops caught in spider webs and on flowers.

He said: 'I am very interested in macro photography - it's a real passion and it grows with every pictures I take. I love the shapes and colors which can been seen in macro photography.'

'The lens I used to capture my pictures is difficult to master because of body vibration so when I am taking a picture I try to hold my breath!

'I have to be extremely calm and relax so I can get the perfect shot and not scare the bugs away.'
