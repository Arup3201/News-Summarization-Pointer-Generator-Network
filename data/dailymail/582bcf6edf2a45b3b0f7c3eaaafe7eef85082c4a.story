A leader of the notorious Islamic extremist group al-Shabab has given himself up in Somalia, according to intelligence officials. 

Zakariya Ismail Ahmed Hersi, who had a $3million bounty attached to him by the U.S. in 2012 for his capture, surrendered to Somali police in the Gedo region.

A Somali intelligence officer, who insisted on remaining anonymous, said Hersi may have surrendered because he fell out with those loyal to Ahmed Abdi Godane, al-Shabab's top leader.

Godane was killed in a U.S. airstrike earlier this year, the officer said, and Hersi has been on the run ever since.

Hersi was one of seven top al-Shabab officials whom the Obama administration offered a total $33 million in rewards for information leading to their capture in 2012. 

It is not clear if the reward will be paid out for Hersi because he surrendered.

Regional military official, Jama Muse, told Al Jazeera: 'Zakariya Ahmed was a very senior person who worked with Godane.

'He was in charge of intelligence and finances. He was one of the senior al-Shabab commanders who the Americans put a lot of money on their head,' he added.

But, a spokesman from al-Shabab told the broadcaster that Hersi left the group two years ago and surrendered to the Somali government.

The spokesman also said that when he was a mid-level commander within the group and not an intelligence chief, as claimed by Somali officials..

Meanwhile another Somali military official, Mohamed Osmail, said Hersi was hiding in a house in a border town and made contact with government officials in order to hand himself in.

Despite major setbacks in 2014, al-Shabab remains a threat in Somalia and the East African region. 

The group has carried out many terror attacks in Somalia and some in neighboring countries including Kenya, whose armies are part of the African Union troops bolstering Somalia's weak U.N.- backed government.

On Christmas Day, al-Shabab launched an attack at the African Union base in Mogadishu. 

Nine people died, including three African Union soldiers, in the attack on the complex, which also houses U.N. offices and western embassies. 

Al-Shabab said the attack was aimed at a Christmas party and was in retaliation for the killing of the group's leader Godane.

The extremist group also claimed that 14 soldiers were killed but it is thought the militants often exaggerates the number of people they kill.

Al-Shabab is waging an Islamic insurgency against Somalia's government that is attempting to rebuild the country after decades of conflict.

The group controlled much of Mogadishu during the years 2007 to 2011, but was pushed out of Somalia's capital and other major cities by African Union forces. 

The United States and the U.N. warn that political infighting in Somalia is putting at risk the security gains. The federal government remains weak and wields little power outside the capital Mogadishu.
