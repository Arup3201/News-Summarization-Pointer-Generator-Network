Appointed: Anthea McIntyre has been made an MEP, despite there having been no election and no votes cast

A Tory businesswoman was made Britain’s newest MEP yesterday without a single vote being cast.

Anthea McIntyre from Ross on Wye, Herefordshire, was handed the £84,500-a-year post after Brussels said the UK had qualified for another seat in the European Parliament.

The move results from the Lisbon Treaty which created an extra 18 MEPs. Britain qualified for one, which officials said should be for the West Midlands region.

The Electoral Commission analysed the results of the 2009 European elections to decide who would have won the seat if it had then been contested.

Foreign Office minister David Lidington announced yesterday that Miss McIntyre had been judged the winner.

She is expected to take up her seat in Brussels next week, when she will also qualify for a range of lavish expenses and benefits.

The total cost to the taxpayer of each MEP is estimated at more than £2million a year.

UK Independence Party MEP Mike Nattrass condemned the method of Miss McIntyre’s election as deeply undemocratic.

Mr Nattrass said: ‘It is an outrage that somebody becomes an MEP on the basis of a decision by the Electoral Commission, rather than a decision by the people of this country. Worse still that the individual is forced upon them by a party, not chosen by an electorate.’

But Miss McIntyre, who has made a number of unsuccessful bids to enter Parliament, said she was ‘thrilled’ by the decision.

She said she had faced a ‘long wait’ while the Lisbon deal was agreed by all 27 EU states.

She added: ‘I have got my flight booked and I’m going to Brussels on Monday and I’m really looking forward to getting stuck in.’

European elections are decided by a complicated system of proportional representation involving lists of candidates drawn up by party officials.

Miss McIntyre was the third candidate on the Conservative slate – making her the highest ranked losing candidate in 2009.
