Good news: David Cameron today claims that three million will be exempt from income tax when a rise in the threshold takes effect on Sunday

Three million workers will have been taken out of income tax altogether when a rise in the tax threshold takes effect on Sunday, David Cameron will say today.

The Prime Minister will issue a defiant message to Tory MPs who have been calling for more help for higher-rate taxpayers, as he embarks on a tour of the UK to talk up the economy.

He will insist that it is right to have targeted the basic-rate threshold – saying it is among his proudest achievements.

And Mr Cameron will highlight new figures from HM Revenue and Customs showing that the cumulative income tax cut over the life of this parliament will be £1,824 for the typical taxpayer.

More than 26million people will benefit from the Government’s latest increase in the point at which people start to pay tax, which will reach £10,000 on Sunday.

The increase will take another 200,000 part-time and lower-paid workers out of income tax entirely, most of them women. This means the total who do not pay tax will reach three million for the first time.

A full-time employee on the minimum wage will pay nearly two-thirds less income tax than at the last election, while someone working for around 30 hours a week will not pay any at all.

This year’s rise means that the typical taxpayer is now paying £705 a year less in income tax than they were in 2010.

Ahead of a meeting in the North West today with workers who will benefit, the Prime Minister said: ‘A key part of this Government’s long-term economic plan is to cut taxes so that people can keep more of the money they earn and feel more financially secure.

'Nearly nine out of ten hard-working people across the country will benefit from this tax cut on Sunday - and it’s one of the proudest things I have done in Government.’

The Prime Minister’s remarks are likely to irritate the Liberal Democrats, who claim the credit for making personal allowance increases the Government’s top tax priority.

Mr Cameron is also expected to hail the latest corporation tax cut from 23 per cent to 21 per cent, which takes effect this week. It has fallen from 28 per cent in 2010 and will fall further to 20 per cent in April 2015.

The employment allowance also comes into effect – giving 1.25 million businesses and charities up to £2,000 off their National Insurance contributions.

A little less taxing: Mr Cameron will highlight new figures from HM Revenue and Customs showing that the cumulative income tax cut over the life of this parliament will be £1,824 for the typical taxpayer

Mr Cameron has rejected growing calls for a halt to the number of middle-class professionals being sucked into the higher 40p rate of tax, the threshold for which has not been increased in line with the 20p threshold.

Senior Tories including two former chancellors and London Mayor Boris Johnson have urged Mr Osborne to indicate he wants to ease the 40p squeeze on these workers.

But the Chancellor used last week’s Budget to again raise the threshold for basic rate income tax to £10,500 from April 2015, while rejecting pleas to stop more people being dragged into the 40p tax band, which kicks in at £41,450.

It will be increased by just one per cent from next year, below inflation.

Ministers insist that despite this, anyone earning up to £100,000 is better off thanks to the Government’s dramatic increases in the personal allowance.
