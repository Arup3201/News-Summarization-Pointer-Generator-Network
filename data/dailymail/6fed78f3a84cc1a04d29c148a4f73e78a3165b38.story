Among the flying displays and exhibitors at this year’s Farnborough Air Show, visitors were also treated to a number of high-tech and revolutionary aviation technologies.

These include a flying buggy prototype, lightweight fuel tanks that collapse and bend, and control sticks that let pilots ‘feel’ if their plane has a problem.

Other highlights included the world premiere of the most advanced jet radar, and a Boeing Dreamliner looping and soaring like a stunt plane.

The 49th Farnborough International Air Show is taking place in Hampshire this week. It features exhibitions and flying displays. Airbus demonstrated its A400M military transport plane (pictured) that will operate in cargo transport, troop transport, medical evacuation, aerial refuelling, and electronic surveillance

The Farnborough International Air Show is a biannual event held in Hampshire in July. The show moves to Paris for the year in between. It is now in its 49th year.

It typically attracts more than 200,000 
trade and public visitors over the course of seven days, and this year 
featured more than 1,600 exhibitors.

Highlights include: 

British engineering firm Parajet showing off its SkyRunner flying 'car' that is a quick as a Porsche, but can also take to the air.

The ‘world premiere’ of 
the most advanced AESA radar, called the Captor-E, installed on 
Eurofighter Typhoon prototype IPA5.

BAE Systems Active Inceptor Systems (or Active Sticks) used only by military pilots will 
soon be available in commercial cockpits.

BAE also announced its stealth Unmanned Combat 
Air Vehicle Taranis has successfully completed a second 
phase of flight testing, flying almost invisible to radar.

Elsewhere, Aero Sekur presented its latest flexible fuel tanks made from Kevlar and rubber that can bend and morph into complex shapes and tight spaces.

During this year’s event, British engineering firm Parajet was showing off its flying 'car' that is a quick as a Porsche, but can also take to the air.

The SkyRunner is billed as 'part buggy, part aircraft' and claims to be the 'ultimate recreational vehicle'.

It is powered by a one litre Ford EcoBoost engine that provides 123 brake horsepower and 147lb/ft of torque.

This gives the unusual vehicle a 0 to 60mph time of just 4.3 seconds - the same as a mid-range Porsche 911.

The vehicle can also take off and fly at 55mph (88km/h) in the air.

The SkyRunner goes from buggy to aircraft in around three minutes and can take off on fields, grass strips and secluded beaches.

When in the air, it uses paraglide technology, in the form of a large parachute-like wing, to reach a maximum altitude of 15,000ft (4,750 metres), although it is restricted to 10,000ft or 3,000 metres, which is a popular height for a sky dive and can still be above the clouds.

Tuesday saw the ‘world premiere’ of what’s been dubbed the most advanced active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, called the Captor-E, installed on Eurofighter Typhoon prototype IPA5.

The firm announced at the show the radar is now ready to starting testing.

Executives from Eurofighter and Euroradar explained how matching Captor-E with the Typhoon jet delivers a ‘paradigm shift’, adding that ‘we believe now we are at the forefront of this technology’.

The Captor-E AESA radar is unique because it combines a wide-field of view, with a repositioner, tilt Transmit/Receive Modules (TRM) and antenna aperture.

This gives jet pilots an advantage because it means they can crank and notch 90 degress while keeping keeping the enemy tracked on radar.

BAE Systems used the event to announce cutting-edge technology previously used only by military pilots will soon be available in commercial cockpit.

The controls sticks also provide linking between the two pilots, to increase awareness across the cockpit, and therefore, safety. This means pilots (pictured) can 'fly by touch', which revolutionises how commercial flights will handle plane problems, for example

The firm’s Active Inceptor Systems (or Active Sticks) have been used by fighter jets for decades, and offers pilots tactile cues that allow them to feel feedback from the plane, including the way it is being flown and if they are reaching the limits of the aircraft's capabilities.

They also provide linking between the two pilots, to increase awareness across the cockpit, and therefore, safety.

Aero Sekur presented its latest flexible fuel tanks (pictured) made from rubber and Kevlar. This makes it half the weight of existing designs

This means pilots can ‘fly by touch’, which revolutionises how commercial flights will handle plane problems, for example.

The reduced mechanical complexity of BAE Systems' Active Sticks is also said to reduce maintenance costs, and the potential for mechanical failure. 

BAE also announced its Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle demonstrator Taranis has successfully completed a second phase of flight testing.

During tests, Taranis flew in a fully ‘stealthy’ configuration, making it virtually invisible to radar.

In order to achieve this level of stealth, the team changed all antennas on the aircraft to signature control variants, and the air data boom on the nose of Taranis was removed.

Following these modifications Taranis used a specially-designed system that allowed the aircraft to generate a full set of flight data, without the use of an external probe or boom. 

Meanwhile, Italian firm Piaggio used the international air show as the opportunity to show off its P.1HH Hammerhead drone craft. It carried out successful tests in February and is designed to perform intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions at 45,000 ft (13,700 metres)

Taranis also used latest stealth communication systems to stay in touch with its mission commander without revealing its position to the enemy.

Elsewhere, Aero Sekur presented its latest flexible fuel tanks to trade visitors at the International Air Show.

Aero Sekur is already known for is flexible structures, including Mars landing bags, and its latest is a fuel tank that uses two layers of rubber and Kevlar.

Taranis (graphic pictured) is named after the Celtic god of thunder and designed to fly faster than the speed of sound and evade enemy radar with its single-wing stealth design. During tests, Taranis also used latest stealth communications systems to stay in touch with its commander without revealing its position

This creates a fuel tank that is half the weight of existing designs.

It is also self-sealing, can be morphed into complex shapes, and doesn’t have the wear and tear seen on metal tanks.

A video earlier this week also 
revealed a Boeing Dreamliner plane rehearsing stunts it is expected to 
perform to the public this weekend at the show.

From
 a terrifying vertical climb after take-off to a series of dramatic 
turns, pilots Mike Byran and Randy Neville were shown putting the plane through its paces.

The
 moves, which include a turn so tight that the plane almost seems to 
stand still as it banks around, imitate tricks more associated with a 
compact fighter jet.

The 260ft (80 metre) plane normally carries around 280 passengers. Its super lightweight design enables the pilots to perform the stunts. and in the long term will mean airlines spend a lot less on fuel, making them more environmentally sustainable
