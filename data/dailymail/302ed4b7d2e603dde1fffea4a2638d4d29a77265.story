Only four companies have signed on to base their operations in the World Trade Center as the majority of the world's most expensive office building remains available for rent.

Magazine publishing company Conde Nast are the largest tenants, having claimed 24 floors starting on the 20th floor.

The China Center, a company that provides office space for Chinese businesses, has signed on for floors 64 through 69.

A hospitality management company, Legends Hospitality, has purchased 100,000 square feet on the 100th, 101st, and 102nd floors which includes the observation deck.

Mashable reports
 that the final interested party is the General Services Administration,
 a federal agency, who has claimed six floors starting on the 50th floor
 as their new base of operations.

Scores of empty floors: The majority of the World Trade Center remains unallocated

That means that approximately 39 of the 104 floors occupied and 65 unclaimed.

This week's earlier report that the owners have slashed office rents nearly 10 per cent comes as little surprise then.

The Wall Street Journal  reported that rents have been cut to $69 a square foot for larger tenants on the building's middle floors.

Developer Douglas Durst says that is down from $75 a square foot.

'The market's not there,' Mr Durst told The Wall Street Journal.

He bought a stake in the 1,776-foot tower from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 2011. 

'When we started in 2011, everybody expected the economy to take off, and obviously that hasn't happened.'

All told, the construction of the 1,776-foot building cost $3.9billion

Major tenants in the building include magazine publisher Conde Nast and the government's General Services Administration.

The skyscraper, the nation's tallest building, is scheduled to open later this year.

Filling the floors: The developer has cut the asking rent for the middle floors of the World Trade Center from $75-per-foot to $69-per-foot

Competition: Rent in some of the middle floors of the World Trade Center have been knocked to $69-per-foot but neighboring buildings cost closer to $53-per-foot so that makes it tough for businesses to swallow

'We have a lot of people looking at the space, but because of the asking rent, we are not able to really put anything over the finish line,' Mr Durst told The Journal.

Part of the problem is that while there is a great deal of interest in real estate downtown- with Time Inc and the Bank of New York Mellon Corp. among the list of companies looking to move their operations south- the neighboring buildings are able to charge far cheaper rental rates.

For instance, average downtown office rents were $53.87 in the first three months of this year, making the 1 World Trade Center rates more difficult to accept.
