William Hague yesterday hinted that Britain could support a female candidate for European Commission president.

The Foreign Secretary said he believed it was important ‘there are women in the top jobs’ of Europe as he continued to voice his opposition to leading candidate Jean-Claude Juncker.

‘It’s very important in our view that a range of candidates are looked at,’ he told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show.

‘This is only one of the top jobs being decided in the European Union, there are four or five such jobs and it’s very important there is a political balance, a geographical balance, it’s important there are women in the top jobs.’

He refused to name his preferred candidates for the presidency. ‘There are talented candidates around Europe and what I’m not going to do is set up a candidate, to embarrass a candidate today who will then be attacked by the media or other countries,’ he said.

‘So we will keep our counsel and keep in close touch with other countries, the Prime Minister will have further discussions about this over the next few days with other heads of government, the important thing for us is the trajectory of the EU and our ability to deliver reform, renegotiation, powers to come back from Brussels.’

Potential: Dalia Grybauskaite, the President of Lithuania, has emerged as possible consensus candidates for the presidency following Britain¿s staunch opposition to Mr Juncker

Leaders: Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the Prime Minister of Denmark (left) has also been named as a potential candidate, while IMF chief Christine Lagarde (right) has already ruled her self out of contention

Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the Prime Minister of Denmark, and Dalia Grybauskaite, the President of Lithuania, have both emerged as possible consensus candidates for the presidency following Britain’s staunch opposition to Mr Juncker.

IMF chief Christine Lagarde has already ruled her self out of contention.

Mr Cameron is strongly opposed to the former prime minister of Luxembourg’s belief in closer political union between EU member states. He will today travel to Sweden to push for an alternative candidate in talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Miss Thorning-Schmidt is the daughter-in-law of former Labour leader Neil Kinnock. She attracted international attention after she was seen taking a selfie with David Cameron and Barack Obama at Nelson Mandela’s memorial service.
