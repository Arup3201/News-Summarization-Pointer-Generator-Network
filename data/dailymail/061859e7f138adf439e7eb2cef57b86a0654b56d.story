School leavers should think about starting their own business instead of just planning to go to university, the employment minister has said.

Esther McVey said that for many teenagers, being their own boss would be better than embarking on a career with a large firm.

She said she wanted to encourage people who have a 'seed' of an idea to pursue it, instead of feeling pressured to follow friends or family into taking a degree. 

Employment minister Esther McVey, pictured visiting a Brompton bicycle factory last week, said she wanted young people to focus on what was right for them

Miss McVey, who was promoted last week in the Cabinet reshuffle, said the choices made by people to become apprentices or self-employed are 'equal and good and worthwhile' when compared to those who choose to go to university.

Ms McVey told the Daily Telegraph that the Conservative party should be supporting people no matter which route they take to employment.

'That is what we should be doing, liberating everyone's potential, whether it's a self-made individual, whether it's someone taking the university route, whether it's the apprenticeship route.

'They are all equal and good and worthwhile. To think that we are all the same and going to follow the same journey, that is wrong.'

The minister, whose father was self-employed, said a significant number of those who have claimed a New Enterprise Allowance supporting people on benefits who want to start a new business are aged between 18 and 24.

In an interview with MailOnline last week, she urged young people to get their first job 'as soon as possible'. 

She argues that whether working in a florist, funeral directors or grocers, a first job can provide money, but also friends, skills and insight into jobs they never knew existed.

More than 4.5 million people are self-employed, the highest since records began in 1992, after an increase of 404,000 over the past year

Some people might try out a desk job or work in a bank on a Saturday but decide: ‘Actually I don’t like that at all I’m outdoors and people have ended up being gardeners or chartered surveyors.

‘Or sometimes you say what drives my desire to learn is actually a real hands-on practical skill, looking at engineering, manufacturing.

‘It’s that creation of something has then forced their desire to then do more in maths, physics or chemistry which they would not otherwise have had.

‘They said they sat in the school classroom and it just never came to life learning the periodic table but do you know now they are on a factory floor and seeing what they can create.’

Figures last week showed more than 30 million people are in a job, an increase of almost one million over the past year, the best figures since records began in 1971, while unemployment has fallen by 121,000 to 2.12 million, the lowest since the end of 2009.

Other figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance fell last month, the 20th consecutive monthly fall and the lowest total since 2008.

More than 4.5 million people were self-employed, the highest since records began in 1992, after an increase of 404,000 over the past year.
