Researchers found the one glass of wine many drivers think is acceptable may be too much for over-55s

Having just one glass of wine could be enough to dangerously affect older drivers, researchers have warned.

In tests comparing the effects of alcohol on different age groups, they found that the driving skills of the over-55s plummeted compared to younger people.

The research involved 36 people aged 25 to 35 and 36 people aged 55 to 70 who took a computer-based driver simulation test while sober and then again after varying amounts of alcohol, although not enough to put them over the drink-drive limit.

Each person was assessed as they ‘drove’ down a simulated three-mile stretch of winding country road.

The drivers stared straight ahead at a large computer monitor.

Two computer monitors flanked the first, mimicking the side windows of a car and what the drivers would see in their peripheral vision.

Occasionally, the drivers would encounter an oncoming car, but they did not encounter other distractions, 'not even a cow'.

After a drink, and a time lapse to mimic having alcohol with their dinner and then driving home, they were put behind the wheel again.

The researchers from the University of Florida found that the small, legal levels of intoxication only affected the driving abilities of the older group.

They assessed the drivers’ ability to stay in the centre of their lane and maintain a constant speed.

They also looked at how rapidly they adjusted their steering wheel.

Professor of psychiatry and psychology Dr Sara Jo Nixon said they found it a ‘bit surprising’ that younger drivers’ skills were not affected by the alcohol, although she warned that the tests did not prove they would be safer on real roads.

PhD student Alfredo Sklar said: 'These simulations have been used a lot in looking at older adults, and they have been used at looking how alcohol affects the driving of younger adults, but no one’s ever looked at the combination of aging drivers and alcohol.'

Further research is planned to measure how the brain responds during the driving test when dosed with alcohol.

The findings are published in the journal Psychopharmacology.
