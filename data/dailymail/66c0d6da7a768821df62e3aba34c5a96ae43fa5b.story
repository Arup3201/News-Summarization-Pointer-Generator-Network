A threat against President Barack Obama's niece, a player on Princeton's women's basketball team, prompted increased security at the Tigers' NCAA Tournament game at Maryland on Monday night. 

Leslie Robinson is a freshman forward for the Tigers.

Her father, Craig Robinson, is the brother of first lady Michelle Obama.

Before the second round game began at the XFINITY Center in College Park, Maryland, a woman left an eight-minute voicemail for the Maryland athletic department claiming a man was driving around campus with a Glock handgun, USA Today reported. 

A person who spoke to the AP said the threat was taken seriously.

After Monday's game, Princeton coach Courtney Banghart confirmed that she was aware of the threat before tipoff but  Robinson was not. 

Princeton lost to Maryland 85-70 on Monday, the Tigers' only defeat of the season.

The Tigers forward did not appear in either of Princeton's NCAA Tournament games this season 

On Saturday, President Obama attended Princeton's 80-70 victory over Wisconsin-Green Bay.

Neither the president nor the first lady attended Monday's game, although Supreme Court Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan sat near Princeton's bench. 

Robinson did not appear in either of Princeton's NCAA Tournament games.

Coach Banghart said: 'It's incredibly disappointing that the first question we get [after] being 31-1 [and] in the NCAA Tournament is about a freak,

'College Park police, I'm sure, had that under control. 

'Leslie is safe. She's in my locker room. No one loves her like I do. 

'She's an important part of our team.

'Keep the freaks out of our gym.'

Laurin Mincy scored 27 points to help top-seeded Maryland  advance to the Sweet 16 of the women's tournament.

After the win, Maryland celebrated in the locker room by putting a Terrapins jersey on a cutout of President Obama.
