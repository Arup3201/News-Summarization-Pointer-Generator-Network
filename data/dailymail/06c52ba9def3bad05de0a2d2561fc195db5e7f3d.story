A vibrating belt could help eliminate lumbago or lower back pain

The Lumbia belt aims to remedy lumbago and, in particular, to prevent the need for surgery.

Lumbago is thought to affect 80 per cent of people at some point in their life.

The condition affects both young and old people. In many cases no cause can be found for 
the pain, but age, arthritis, spinal damage and particularly poor 
posture are usually to blame.

According to Arthritis UK, lower back pain costs the UK £12 billion each year.

Usually the discomfort is across the lower part of the back and sometimes radiates into the buttocks, the back of the thigh or to the groin.

The pain is usually worse on movement and sometimes it is accompanied by sciatica (nerving tingling or numbness down one leg).

Lumbago affects 80 per cent of people

Treatment typically involves painkillers and rest but in severe cases surgery to correct a spinal problem may be needed.

In extreme cases bladder and bowel function can be affected with limbs becoming very weak. 

This is an emergency and usually means that spinal damage may be causing compression of the spinal cord and nerves.

Early treatment is essential to prevent permanent damage.

The new Lumbia uses a sensor to detect when a sufferer's posture is poor.

In these cases, the belt vibrates to remind the patient that they must change posture.At the same time the sensor emits all the information it gathers to a computer so a therapist can help monitor the patient’s posture behaviour.

By understanding when the patient tends to sit or stand poorly, relevant therapies and exercises can be prescribed.

It is hoped the new technology will be on the market in 2014.

‘For perfect posture and to reduce back pain, interlink your fingers from each hand behind your back, just like Prince Charles does,’ advises physiotherapist Sammy Margo. 

‘This will open up your chest and get your shoulders back and down, reversing the slumping posture many people have while sitting.’

And to prevent slumping, the mantra is BBC — bum in the back of the chair — she adds.

Poor posture will throw the body out of its correct alignment, so certain muscles become overworked, while others, such as the stomach muscles, start to weaken through lack of use.

This can cause undue stress and strain, especially on the lower back.
