The women at the center of a lawsuit claiming their rights to dignity and privacy were violated by a Washington police department have spoken of their ordeal.

Twelve victims claim they were filmed by security cameras as they stripped and, in some cases, used the toilet a at Payallup police station after being arrested for DUI.

A Seattle defense attorney, who highlighted their plight, has likened the filming of the young women to 'a peep show'.

Leading the case: Seattle attorney James Egan first filed a lawsuit on behalf of 11 women and one man in August. He has since been contacted by more than two dozen other people with similar stories

James Egan, who is representing the 12 victims in a lawsuit against the police, told ABC News show 20/20: 'I've represented 1,000 people in DUIs, 
and I've never seen this.'

After discovering that officers had been recording videos of mostly young women as they changed in police cells he contacted 11 women and a man who were alleged victims in the case in May.

He said: 'This practice appears to be a peep show,' and added that his clients feared the footage could go viral on the internet because the footage is a public record.

His clients are now suing city of Puyallup, police chief Bryan Jeter and Lieutenant Edward Shannon for allegedly violating their fundamental rights to bodily privacy and dignity and engaging in unlawful searches and seizures of the inmates.

Some of the women at the center the case, who asked to remain anonymous, have spoken of their distress at the recordings.

'The fear, the embarrassment, the anger of knowing that somebody has these videos ... and it's happening to all these other women,' Plaintiff 4 told 20/20.

'I felt like a doll they were just 
dressing up and dressing down ... and I didn't have the fight in me to 
stand up for myself.'

Indecent: Some of the videos, which were obtained by public record requests, show the women undressing

'Sick': More than three dozen people being held in Puyallup city jail in Washington State on DUI charges have complained about their treatment at the facility after discovering intimate moments, such as going to the bathroom, were being recorded by CCTV cameras

Scene: The jail at the center of the action is inside this Puyallup Police building in Washington state

Although the jail has a curtained off area for inmates to change, the women were ordered to strip inÂ  holding cell that has an overhead camera above.

After changing into jail clothes the women were returned to the cell and forced to strip again so they could put on their own clothes before being released.

At the time, they believed the procedure of stripping in front of a camera was part of police protocol.

Since the original case was filed in August nearly 40 other women have come forward with similar stories.

'They're there to serve and protect and protect us, and they completely took advantage of each and every one of us,' Plaintiff 4 said.

Plaintiff One added: 'I don't even think I really thought that that was something that was probably an ongoing recording, and, again, you're just - you know, kind of assume that that's just what is normal.'

Another of the alleged victims said the cell was so cold she had to ask for a blanket, at which point an officer claimed he would be watching her.

'[The officer] told me ... if I do jumping jacks he'll be watching: "Don't do jumping jacks naked 'cause I'll be watching".' Plaintiff 2 claimed.

Captain Engle has defended the jail however, saying that the video monitoring is legal and appropriate.

'When
you step foot into a correctional institution, your expectation of 
privacy is greatly diminished,' said, adding that officers were not 
watching the activity on the camera.

'All
of these cases, there are no officers viewing the video or the monitor 
at any time through any of these allegations,' he said.

The Captain added that an internal investigation had found no evidence of wrongdoing.

Almost all complainants were being held on suspected DUI offenses, for which they are typically released in a matter of hours.

Earlier this year one female complainant said that, after changing into a jail uniform, a jailer asked her to go back into her cell and remove her underwear.

'What possible security reason could they have ... she's going to hand herself with her panties?' said Seattle attorney James Egan, whose law firm is handling the case.

'She's about to be released and out the door.'

Mr Egan has obtained several surveillance tapes from Puyallup city jail through public record requests, which were released to King5.

He said the women were unaware their actions were being recorded on a monitor that was watched by mostly male jailers.

Attorneys acting on behalf of Puyallup city jail say the camera operations inside the facility are standard practive

One woman from Kings County, who chose not to be identified, was arrested for suspected drunk driving in April and said she refused to change her clothes until a female officer was present because she was comfortable with the four male guards nearby.

'Basically I was harassed for not doing it and put back in the holding cell and made to stay there for about 12 hours,' the woman said.

Another woman said there was no reason for her to strip naked.

'I thought maybe it was for seeing if we have contraband of something, but we are already patted down,' she said. 'So then why would there be a camera still?'

'I just didn't feel comfortable with the situation so I wasn't going to do it': This woman, who asked not to be identified, refused to undress on camera after being arrested on suspected drunk driving

Jail experts say such levels surveillance were extremely unusual.

Kenneth Burns, an architect who has designed 40 jails, said he was 'stunned' by the recently released videos.

'We do have lots of cameras but (usually) you cannot watch anywhere where someone is using the shower, toilet facilities or a changing area,' Burns told King5.

However Puyallup City attorney Kevin Yamamota, speaking on behalf of the jail, said placing cameras in common areas and cells was standard practice and that there are no plans to change such methods.

'The jail videos we've watched so far don't show any inappropriate activity,' Mr Yamamota said.

Payallup City attorney Kevin Yamamota maintained jail officers had acted 'very professionally'
