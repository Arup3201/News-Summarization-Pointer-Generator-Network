The wife of the Sydney man Mohamed Elomar who is fighting with the extremist group ISIS in Syria is planning a legal challenge against the Australian government, saying terrorism charges against her are 'unconstitutional'.

Fatima Elomar, a mother of four who was arrested trying to board an international flight earlier this year to allegedly join husband Mohamed in Syria, appeared in a Sydney court on Tuesday morning.

Ms Elomar, 30, is charged with preparing for incursions into a foreign state with the intention of engaging in hostile activities.

She applied to Magistrate Teresa O'Sullivan in the Downing Centre Court in Sydney not to have to appear personally the next time her case was up for mention because she had a baby to look after.

The accused, whose face was uncovered during the brief court hearing, then exited the court wearing a full-face niqab, just as she had done at her previous court hearing when she and her four children left the court draped in cloths and blankets.

Ms Elomar was arrested by joint counter-terrorism detectives at Sydney Airport on May 3 while trying to board a flight to Malaysia. She was reportedly carrying cash and camouflage gear on behalf of her husband.

Ms Elomar said she was travelling on holiday with her with her two young sons, daughter and baby.

In the months since Ms Elomar's arrest, husband Mohamed Elomar has become one of ISIS's 'poster' Aussie terrorists, posing in the besieged Syrian town of al Raqqa with a pair of severed heads and posting the photos on social media.

Through her lawyer, Ms Elomar has said she is a ‘devoted mother’ of her four children and described the charges against her as ‘serious and over-zealous’.

The Brisbane woman has remained in Sydney and reported to police while on bail, and has had to send her children to schools here. 

In a statement released following her arrest through her lawyer, Zali Burrows, Ms Elomar said her children had suffered enough from not being able to visit Malaysia for a holiday, which she claims was her only intended destination when she boarded the plane. 

'The ordeal of being interviewed without their mother, being unable to return home to their friends and school, having to adjust to a new way of life of reporting in to the police station with mum, and the task of trying to make new friends at a new school in a new state,’ Ms Burrows said.

She told Daily Mail Australia Ms Elomar would be mounting a legal challenge in the High Court of Australia against the foreign incursion charges under the Crimes Act. 

Ms Burrows could not give a date when the challenge would be filed but said she had made the High Court aware of the looming application. 

Ms Elomar's husband, Mohamed, is the nephew of convicted terrorist Mohamed Elomar, who plotted with four other men in 2005 to bomb targets in a bid to force Australia's government to change its policy on Middle East conflicts.

Mr Elomar is believed to have flown to Syria late last year with Khaled Sharrouf, a convicted terrorist, who fled the country on his brother's passport. 

Mr Sharrouf has also posted photographs of himself and his children allegedly from Syria on social media, with one of his sons posing with a severed head. 

Ms Elomar said earlier this year through Ms Burrows that her arrest highlighted the pitfalls for travellers packing camouflage gear as a fashion item. 

'At the end of the day this is an example of one must be careful what you pack to travel, let it be a travel warning to leave the camouflage pants at home and best check with Smart Traveller as to what the acceptable fashion is,’ she said.

Ms Elomar's case was adjourned until December 16 so prosecutors could seek further documentation as the Federal Attorney General's office prepares a brief for prosecution.
