Decades after being sexually assaulted, the woman who sparked the police investigation into Stuart Hall has given a harrowing account of the alleged abuse she suffered.

The woman, who has remained anonymous, claims the BBC broadcaster groomed her over a number of meetings, before plying her with alcohol and eventually having sex with her when she was a teenager.

She says they had sex on at least three occasions and he even put her on the contraceptive pill and got the prescription himself.

The woman claims veteran broadcaster Stuart Hall put her on the contraceptive pill when she was a teen

And like other victims who have come forward since Hall admitted 14 counts of indecent assault against young girls, the woman said he met her at her school.

Hall, 83, pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting 13 girls aged as young as nine, it was announced yesterday.

Detectives first launched an investigation into Hall after the woman sent the anonymous letter to Independent journalist Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, who then passed it onto police.

In the letter, published for the first time today, she writes that he groomed and exploited her when she was a shy but intelligent schoolgirl in the 1970s.

She said he was invited to her school for a prize giving and after the ceremony he asked the headteacher for permission to take her to the BBC studios - which was granted.

It was her anonymous letter that sparked the investigation into Hall and he has since pleaded guilty to 14 counts of indecent assault on girls as young as nine years old

The woman said she finally wanted to reveal her secret after he was made an OBE and said she also feared he would die before being brought to justice, like Jimmy Savile

The woman wrote in the letter published by The Independent: 'I was young for my years and easy meat for a man like him'.

She said she was allowed to meet him alone at the BBC, where during the third visit he gave her champagne before having sex with her in his dressing room.

She alleges they had sex on at least 
two other occasions but that she has blocked out the painful memories and is 
unsure if it happened at any other times.

The woman alleges they even had sex at the home of one of Hall's friends, who 'covered' for his behaviour.

She wrote that as an adult she is furious at his predatory behaviour and the abuse she suffered.

The woman has also been devastated by the effect it had on her relationship with her mother.

She wrote: 'Why am I so angry? Because what he did was to spoil my sense of myself, my relationship with myself, my feeling of who I was for many years.

The woman said the It's a Royal Knockout presenter met her at school and then invited her to the BBC

She said his abuse left her feeling shamed and impacted on her relationship with her mother

'His actions filled me with me with shame and secrecy, and had a terrible effect too on my relationship with my mother.'

After
decades of keeping the alleged abuse secret, the woman said she was finally prompted into 
writing to the newspaper after he was awarded the OBE last year.

She said she feared he would also escape justice, like Jimmy Savile, by dying before the truth was out.

He pleaded guilty to carrying out the attacks between 1968 and 1986 at Preston Crown Court. 

Following a hearing yesterday, the television star's barrister said that Hall was 'only too aware his disgrace is complete'.

Her letter bears striking similarities to the testimonies of two victims, who helped bring Hall to justice.

Like the anonymous woman, Susan Melville met Stuart Hall after he was hired for her school prizegiving.

He invited her to the BBC studios where he groomed and eventually sexually assault her.

After waiving her right to anonymity, Mrs Melville said: ' feel he exploited his position within the BBC to essentially groom me and make me go to the BBC offices.

‘I
am aware that Jimmy Savile did similar things to his victims where he 
would use his celebrity status to gain their trust and then abuse 
them.’

Kim Wright was the first of Hall's victims to make an official complaint.

She was working as a clerk when he grabbed her breast.

She said: 'I was convinced I couldn’t have been
the only one and I felt it was my duty to report it, in case there was 
someone out there who daren’t. Someone who’d suffered more than me.

‘I
felt that if the police could say to another victim, “You’re not the 
only one”, it would give them courage to come forward. It was a moral 
decision and when I found out about all the other women I thought, “Job 
done”.’
