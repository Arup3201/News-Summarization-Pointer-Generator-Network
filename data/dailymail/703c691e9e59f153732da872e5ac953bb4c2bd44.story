Adrian Bevington  is to leave the FA and his role of managing director of Club England, English football's governing body announced on Tuesday.

The highly-respected Bevington, who deals most closely with the England team within the FA hierarchy, has negotiated his exit after 17 years at the FA where he also combined the job of director of communications.

Bevington leaves the FA with a considerable vacuum at the top of the organisation, with general secretary Alex Horne also going at the end of next month.

The communications director, who announced his ambitions of becoming a club chief executive in a sports business magazine profile before the World Cup, has long seen 2014 as his likely last year at Wembley.

And the FA management reforms being carried out by chairman Greg Dyke post-Brazil have clarified that decision. The Club England set up, formed in 2010 to oversee the England operation at all levels and led for the last four years by Bevington, has been heavily diluted by the arrival of technical director Dan Ashworth and his blueprint for training England teams.

And it is Ashworth who now effectively controls the England set-up at all levels from his St George's Park base along with his team of coaches and sports scientists.

However, Bevington will long be remembered at the FA for his consummate skills as an outstanding communications chief. And the way he handled numerous high-profile FA scandals and controversies over the years, ensures he will always be in high demand as a damage limitation specialist - inside and outside sport.

Losing Horne and Bevington in such quick succession will now put a lot of pressure on Dyke to find the right replacements.

Bevington, quoted on the FA's website, said: 'It has been a privilege to work for The FA, but after almost two decades I want a new challenge.

'I have been considering my departure for some time and discussed this with Chairman Greg Dyke recently. I am grateful to Greg and The FA Board for their support over the years and in agreeing to my departure at the end of the month.

'The FA has provided me with tremendous experience and I look forward to drawing on this in the future.

'While it is a disappointment to leave without England winning a major trophy, I am convinced the foundations for success are now in place.

'A huge part of my working life has been spent at The FA and I have worked with so many wonderful people in the industry, both domestically and internationally. I would like to thank everybody who has helped me over the years.'

FA chairman, Greg Dyke, added: 'I'd like to thank Adrian for his contribution and loyalty over almost 17 years at The FA.

'His experience and knowledge have been invaluable at so many levels, but he has made clear he is at a time in his life where he is ready to move on.

'I know that everybody who has worked with him over the past 17 years will miss him, and on behalf of The Football Association I would like to wish him every success in the future.'
