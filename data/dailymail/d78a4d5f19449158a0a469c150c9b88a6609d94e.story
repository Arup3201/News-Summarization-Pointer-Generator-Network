Scientists have finally unravelled why scorpions glow bright green under ultraviolet light. The ability is widely known - but biologists have puzzled over why the creatures might have evolved it.

Biologist Douglas Gaffin of the University of Oklahoma investigated the 'fluorescence' and found that the creatures can 'sense' light using their tails.

The creatures may to have evolved the ability to help them scuttle away under rocks.

Scorpion under ultraviolet light: Biologist Douglas Gaffin of the University of Oklahoma investigated the 'fluorescence' and found that the creatures seem to be able to 'sense' light using their tails

'Scorpions are largely solitary, nocturnal arachnids that glow a bright cyan-green under UV light,' wrote Gaffin in a paper in Animal Behaviour. 'The function of this fluorescence is a mystery.'

Gaffin's team 'blindfolded' scorpions, then tested them with various different colours of light -  and found that the tails seemed to function like secondary 'eyes'.

The insects' shell works as a 'whole-body' sensor which relays information about light to the nervous system - so any part of a scorpion can 'see'.

Scorpion's shells appear to be able to send information to the scorpion so that their whole body works like a giant 'eye' - enabling the creature to seek shelter more effectively

'The cuticle (casing)  may function as a whole-body light collector which relays information to the nervous system,' the researchers wrote.

'Scorpions may use this information to detect shelter, as
blocking any part of the cuticle could diminish the signal.'
