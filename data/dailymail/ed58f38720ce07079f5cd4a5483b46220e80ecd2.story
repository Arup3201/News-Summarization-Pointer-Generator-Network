Amir Khan's prospects of fighting world light-middleweight champion Floyd Mayweather Jnr appear to be over after the Briton said the clash will not go ahead.

The 27-year-old confirmed in January he had signed a contract to fight the pound-for-pound No 1 in Las Vegas but Mayweather left it up to his Twitter followers to decide who he would face - the Bolton fighter or Marcos Maidana.

However, Khan revealed in series of tweets on Friday night that he would not be fighting the undefeated American superstar and how Mayweather would be locking horns with Maidana.

It's off: Khan confirms his fight with Mayweather will not be happening

'No response from Mayweather or his team. Fights not happening. I should of taken the title fight last December against Alexander...,' Khan tweeted.

He went on to write: 'Very disrespected by his team. Wasted my time. Good luck to Maidana, against Mayweather.

'Can I apologise to the thousands of people who are let down. You me and everyone wanted the Mayweather fight. He's running scared.'

Khan had hoped that a new deal signed in December put him in a position to be able to set up a fight with Mayweather.

But when Mayweather put it to his 
followers on Twitter, early indications suggested Khan would not be the 
man taking to the ring on May 3.

Eighty per cent of fans voted for Maidana, who has won 35 of his 38 career bouts, on a fightnews.com poll.

Ironically, Khan beat Maidana on points in 2010 when they met in Las Vegas.

Speaking in January, Khan had this to say about the prospect of Mayweather choosing to fight Maidana

'If he wants to face someone I've beaten then so be it,' added Khan. 'He wants to fight someone who makes him look good but styles make fights.'

It appears that Mayweather has decided Khan's style just is not in fashion at the moment.
