The girlfriend of the Australian businessman who murdered his fiancée by throwing her from a 15th-floor balcony has revealed that she's writing a script about the case.

Rachelle Louise, 24, who stood by killer Simon Gittany, 40, throughout his trial in Sydney, said she has given up a career in banking to become an actress and screenwriter.

The story of the death of Canadian former ballerina Lisa Harnum at the hands of Gittany is to be her first project. Although, with Miss Louise maintaining the innocence of her boyfriend, it is likely to be a revisionist account.

Rachelle Louise is surrounded by reporters as she smokes a cigarette outside court following her boyfriend Simon Gittany's conviction for the murder of his fiancée Lisa Harnum by throwing her from a balcony in 2011

Cashing in? She later told Australia's Daily Telegraph that she plans to write a film script about the case

Miss Louise is comforted by supporters outside the court: As Justice Lucy McCallum read out her verdict she had shrieked 'You're wrong' and had to be led from the courtroom in tears

Gittany was just yesterday found guilty of murdering Miss Harnum in July 2011 after a bitter row during which a security camera had shown him dragging her back into the apartment they shared with his hand across her mouth.

Just over a minute later, she had 
plunged to her death - and Justice Lucy McCallum, in a damning 
assessment of Gittany’s character, said she did not believe his story of how his fiancée had fallen from the balcony.

Miss
Louise, who bears more than a passing resemblance to Miss Harnum, was 
one of 17 supporters who had accompanied Gittany to her the verdict read
out.

'You're wrong,' the 
slim brunette shrieked as Judge McCallum said she was satisfied 'beyond a
reasonable doubt' that Gittany had hurled his girlfriend to her death.

Verdict: Gittany pictured arriving at court with Miss Louise for an earlier hearing. She played the role of devoted partner throughout the businessman's trial

Led
from the court in tears, she refused to answer questions as she was 
engulfed by reporters outside the building, merely asking in response: 
'Has anyone got a light? You're journalists, someone's got to have a 
lighter.'

But following 
yesterday's verdict, Miss Louise told Australia's Daily Telegraph that 
she now hopes to cash in on her notoriety following the case.

'I'm
actually writing a movie script about the whole case. I thought it made
sense, because obviously it's something I'm very passionate about,' she
told the paper.

But 
according to the account of Gittany given by Judge McCallum as she read 
out her verdict yesterday, Miss Louise has had a lucky escape.

She stated that Gittany was 'controlling, dominating and, at times, abusive' of Ms Harnum.

She found he lied 'with telling ease' and distorted the truth when he took the stand.

'At
many times in his evidence the accused struck me as being a person 
playing a role, telling a story which fit with the objective evidence 
but which did no more than that,' Justice McCallum  reported News.co.au.

'His account of what happened appeared to exist on borrowed detail.

'It lacked originality and the subtlety of actual experience.'

The
Crown had told the court that Gittany was domineering and had tried to 
control everything his fiancee did, even the way she wore her hair and 
what clothes she chose to go out in.

Gittany had admitted during the trial that he was a ‘jealous partner.’

‘She
would wear revealing clothes, sometimes with no bra. I would tell her 
she should continue to look beautiful but just to tone down how much she
was revealing of her body so she didn’t attract the wrong attention and
give out the wrong signals,’ he told the court.

Guilty: Gittany had denied murdering Canadian former ballerina and aspiring model Lisa Harnum in July 2011 after a bitter row at their 15th-floor home in Sydney, claiming instead that she could have jumped to her death

His
defence team had claimed that Miss Harnum’s struggle with an eating 
disorder may have been the reason she jumped to her death.

The
judge began her summing up by examining the relationship between 
Gittany and his fiancee, saying she had sought to avoid being influenced
by the ‘shocking and tragic’ nature of Miss Harnum’s death. There was 
no doubt, she said, that the couple loved each other.

But the judge said that ‘by the time of her death, Lisa Harnum had no friends except a personal trainer and a counsellor.

Gittany,
she said, had used CCTV cameras to monitor Miss Harnum’s movements in 
their 15th storey apartment and the scrutiny she was subjected to was 
‘intrusive and overbearing.’

Judge
McCallum said the relationship reached the point when Miss Harnum 
changed her Facebook status to ‘single’ and had signed a contract to 
store her belongings in Bondi as she prepared to leave her controlling 
fiancé.

Struggle: The prosecutor asked Gittany if he had used his 'superior strength as a male to commit a serious act of aggression' when he dragged Miss Harnum back into their unit before her death (above)

On the day that 
Gittany found Miss Harnum had packed her bags, said the judge, he 
reacted ‘with nothing short of rage’ and she did not accept his denial 
that he had made enraged threats. ‘I have no hesitation accepting 
evidence of…rage,’ said the judge.

His denials were ‘manifestly implausible…he was controlling and abusive…out of control,’ she added.

Gittany
sat in the dock clutching a small cup of water as the verdict was being
delivered, his new girlfriend, brunette Rachelle Louise sitting in the 
public gallery.

By the end 
of July Gittany’s relationship with Miss Harnum had reached crisis 
point, the judge noted. ‘I do not think there can be any doubt the 
accused was controlling, dominating and at time abusive.’

The
night before her death, the couple had watched Romeo and Juliet in bed 
before he got up to watch porn on the morning of his girlfriend’s death.

‘I
find it difficult to believe he was watching porn on the morning of the
death,’ said the judge, adding she assumed he had instead got up to 
monitor her emails and text messages.

'By 6am on the morning of her death, Lisa Harnum was in a state of absolute fear and despair,’ said the judge.

She
referred to a witness, Josh Rathmell who had told the court of seeing 
Gittany throwing something from the balcony, evidence, she said, that 
was ‘compelling’.

Evidence: CCTV footage shows Simon Gittany holding his hands on his head as he rides a lift moments after he  threw his fiancee to her death off the 15th-floor balcony of their Sydney apartment

Gesticulating: Gittany throws his hands up in the air as he heads to the ground floor where the body of his girlfriend is lying in the street

The judge 
did not believe Gittany’s account of how Miss Harnum fell to her death -
he had told the court he had tried to grab her when she climbed onto 
the balcony but had failed to stop her falling. ‘It’s difficult to 
articulate my impression of that evidence except that I found him 
unconvincing,’ said the judge.

'At
many times in his evidence, the accused struck me as being a person 
playing a role, telling a story which fitted with the objective evidence
but which did no more than that.

‘His account of what happened appeared to exist on borrowed detail.’

As
Justice McCallum’s verdict details entered their fourth hour, Miss 
Louise began to sob, while her boyfriend stared straight ahead at the 
judge.

The judge had up to that point said little that gave him any hope of walking away from the court a free man.

She
said Miss Harnum could not have behaved in the way Gittany said she had
- clambering onto the balcony - without leaving fingerprints.

She said it was likely that Miss Harnum was rendered unconscious before she plunged to her death.

'By 6am on the morning of her death, Lisa Harnum was in a state of absolute fear and despair,’ said the judge

Speaking outside court, an emotional Joan Harnum told reporters 'there are no winners in this case'.

'Two families have had their lives dramatically changed forever,' she said reported Nine News MSN.

'We
will always mourn the loss of our beautiful Lisa Cecilia and are 
working towards making her legacy a powerful wake-up call to young 
women.

'My daughter used to say people can ask for help but children and animals cannot.

'And now young women who are caught up in situations like my daughter found herself in need a voice as well.'

Gittany will face a sentence hearing in February.
