For those harbouring ambitions to manage Barcelona (and for the rest of us) one Spanish paper has gone behind the scenes to reveal what it takes to be in charge of one of the world's greatest football clubs.

Mundo Deportivo's cover story 'Le Cofidencial' has a detailed breakdown of the 44-year-old's average day.

Enrique arrives at training around 7.30am, three and a half hours before the players, and one and a half hours before the rest of his coaches. He heads straight for his office, the same one used by Pep Guardiola, Tito Vilanova and Tato Martino. Unlike, his predecessors, though, Enrique shares the office with one oh his assistants.

Mundo Deportivo reveal Luis Enrique's daily routine while Marca claim Isco will start for Spain on Saturday 

After spending a couple of hours reviewing videos of both Barcelona and their opponents, he heads out to the training pitches with the players. Enrique has complete faith in his coaches and never interrupts when they are taking their own individual sessions.

While there is order under Barcelona's manager, he does not treat the players harshly. The paper claims he commands a natural respect. One rule he does insist upon, though, is that discussing Catalonia's drive for independence is strictly forbidden.

Marca, meanwhile, say Real Madrid midfielder Isco is in line for a place in Spain's starting line-up when they take on Belarus on Saturday. 

The 22-year-old profited from Gareth Bale's recent injury, and his impressive performances have not gone unnoticed by Vicente del Bosque.

The former world champions are second in their Euro 2016 qualifying group, three points behind Slovakia and are looking to a younger generation of players to revive their flagging fortunes.

La Gazzetta dello Sport say new Inter boss Roberto Mancini has become Serie A's highest paid manager

Roberto Mancini's shock return to Inter Milan is the headline story in every Italian newspaper. 

La Gazzetta dello Sport front page proclaims 'MANCIO IS BACK', and says that Walter Mazzarri's replacement has become the highest paid manager in Serie A.

They also suggest Mancini will take the team back to playing a 4-2-3-1 and has highlighted Erik Lamela as a possible January transfer target.

Mancini's first game as manager will be Sunday's Milan derby, but Gazzetta claim city rivals AC are not worried because Spanish striker Fernando Torres is a derby specialist. Chelsea fans may disagree.

Fanatik's front cover carries a story claiming Galatasaray have requested talks with Lukas Podolski

Finally, Turkish newspaper Fanatik claim Lukas Podolski's time at Arsenal is drawing to close as Galatasaray step up their interest.

Their article says Joachim Loew has warned the former Cologne man that if he doesn't play regularly for Arsenal he can't be picked for the national team.

While Podolski has been picky about his clubs in the past, Fanatik say he has taken Loew's threat seriously and is ready to talk to the Turkish giants.
