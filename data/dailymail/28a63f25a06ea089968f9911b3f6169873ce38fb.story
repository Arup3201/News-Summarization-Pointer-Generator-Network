For all the talk about how the young Americans are going to push Rory McIlroy hard this year, it might be someone closer to home who proves the nearest thing to a rival.

Martin Kaymer turned 30 on December 28 and will surely emphasise he is a man in his prime by completing an impressive statement of intent in the desert on Sunday.

The final round of the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship was shaping up to be an epic duel in the sun between the winners of the last three majors when McIlroy notched his first hole in one as a pro on Friday, to pull within two strokes of the German.

As it was, the traditional ‘moving day’ saw Kaymer shoot 65 to set a new 54-hole tournament record of 20 under par and accelerate six clear of gifted Belgian, Thomas Pieters, while the world No 1 fired a 71 to be stuck in reverse.

McIlroy knew where the blame lay for falling hopelessly adrift.

He didn’t play badly by any means, indeed he only missed two fairways and one green in regulation. But his pace on the greens was awry all day.

‘I am extremely disappointed,’ admitted McIlroy. ‘Given how well I struck the ball a 65 or 66 was there for the taking but I missed countless opportunities. It was incredibly wasteful, and it looks like I will be playing for second place.’

Going forward, though, there are plenty of positives. If truth be told, McIlroy rarely putts well on this course, so from that point of view it’s been business as usual.

But he will be enthused by the quality of his ball-striking, which has been right up there with his best days of last year.

Next up is the Dubai Desert Classic in 10 days, where he has putted well in the past, and so will provide a better opportunity for finding his groove on the greens. 

As for Kaymer, he showed once more that when he’s playing his best golf he is a match for anybody, including Mcllroy. He just needs to do it more consistently to give the Northern Irishman a run for his money in the world rankings. Kaymer won the Players Championship and the United States Open during a month-long golden spell during last May and June — but then registered only one top 10 during the rest of the year.

The one time he was in serious trouble yesterday came on the par-five 10th. He had to take a penalty drop and found himself facing a tricky greenside bunker shot having played four strokes already. A double bogey there would have given the chasing pack hope.

As it was, Kaymer played the sand shot to perfection, holing it for the unlikeliest of pars. He did the same thing on the first day, too. Indeed, on the three occasions he’s found himself in greenside bunkers in 54 holes, he’s taken a grand total of four shots to complete the trio of holes.

There’s not much hope for everyone else when someone’s doing that on the odd occasion they’re in trouble, is there?

Pieters coped pretty well with the Kaymer onslaught to post a 70. The 22-year-old big hitter from Antwerp must have learned plenty, and will learn plenty more since he leads the chasing pack on 14 under.

He will accompany Kaymer today, as the German completes the seeming formality of a fourth win on this course. That, in turn, will take him back into the world’s top 10, where he assuredly belongs.
