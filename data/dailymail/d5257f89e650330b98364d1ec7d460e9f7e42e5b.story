It is not the first time a war of words has broken out involving The Archers.

This time, however, the row is not being played out by the drama’s characters – but among its famously dedicated fans.

For decades residents of Inkberrow, Worcestershire, have claimed that Ambridge, where The Archers is set, is based on their village.

Tradition: It has long been thought that The Old Bull pub in Inkberrow is the inspiration for the pub in The Archers

Not only did the soap opera’s creator live nearby, but the BBC has been so convinced of Inkberrow’s claim that it uses its landmarks for publicity shots for the Radio 4 show.

But this week a historian from the other side of the Midlands has started a campaign to convince fans that the soap is, in fact, modelled on his village of Rippingale in Lincolnshire.

Jim Latham believes he has conclusive proof that Godfrey Baseley, who created The Archers, meant for Ambridge to resemble Rippingale.

He argues that Inkberrow was chosen for publicity pictures simply because it is close to BBC Birmingham, where the show is recorded.

Not willing to give up their title without a fight, Inkberrow’s community leaders have dismissed their rival village’s claim as ‘bonkers’. Both, in particular, assert that their local ale house is the inspiration for the Bull pub in the soap.

Mr Latham claims the original idea for the series came from Rippingale farmer Henry Burtt who met Mr Baseley in 1946 while he was producing a show called Farm Visit.

Two years later Mr Burtt was invited to a BBC conference in Birmingham where he allegedly said it should commission a farming version of Dick Barton, the special agent serial.

Mr Latham claims Mr Baseley was so taken
 with the idea he travelled back to Rippingale to have a proper tour, 
and would have visited the local pub – The Bull Inn.

Claims: It has now been claimed that Godfrey Baseley, who created The Archers, pictured, meant for Ambridge to resemble Rippingale

‘It does not take any stretch of the imagination to picture them in the Bull in Rippingale talking over their ideas,’ said Mr Latham.

‘He began designing and building the Archers family and Ambridge from that moment.’

For their part, Inkberrow residents point to an investigation by Countryfile Magazine two years ago which found that Ambridge’s Bull pub was based on Inkberrow’s Old Bull and the fictional Brookfield farm was inspired by Summerhill Farm run by Mr Baseley’s sister-in-law in nearby Hanbury.

Hedli Niklaus of The Archers Addicts fan club said the rural setting was ‘left to the imagination’ of listeners, but added: ‘I think Godfrey would say it’s set in the West Midlands.’
