In 2002, then-Chelsea striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink finished the Premier League season with 23 goals to his name.

Only Thierry Henry (24) scored more than the Dutchman who, at the age 30, had confirmed his status as one of Europe's top marksmen.

It was the second season in a row he had scored 23 in the top flight and the sixth consecutive season in which Hasselbaink had notched more than 15 goals in one of Europe's top divisions.

The year 2002 was also a significant one for Burton Albion.

Under the guidance of player-manager Nigel Clough the Brewers were promoted to the Conference for the first time in their relatively short history after winning the Unibond League.

It is truly remarkable, then, that Hasselbaink is in the Burton hotseat just 12 years later.

But rather than it being a fall from grace for the 42-year-old - whose only previous managerial experience was last season at Belgian second tier side Royal Antwerp - it is instead a testament to the rise in stature of a club well-run by long-serving chairman Ben Robinson and his board.

That being said, Hasselbaink will no doubt find the confines of the Pirelli Stadium and League Two somewhat different to playing at Stamford Bridge and at the 1998 World Cup.

Here's what Hasselbaink can expect to find at Burton Albion...

FACILITIES

The thought of League Two training grounds conjures images of Southend's converted gym or AFC Wimbledon's borrowed recreation park, not of state of the art facilities costing £120million.

Well, that's exactly what Hasselbaink and his players have to work with at the National Football Centre at St George's Park.

Situated in Burton, the FA allowed Albion to train at St George's throughout its construction and they have continued to do so since its official opening in October 2012.

Burton have planning permission in place to build training facilities on the site of their Pirelli Stadium but have not needed to do so after being given permission to remain at St George's for the 'foreseeable future'.

Hasselbaink - who coached at Nottingham Forest from July 2011 to January 2013 - admitted to being 'delighted' with the facilities. 'They are the best in the country,' he said on Thursday.

His predecessor Gary Rowett admitted to Sportsmail in September 2012: 'I've sold the club to some of the new signings by showing them that we're training at one of the best training grounds in the world - not many League Two clubs can say that!'

The Pirelli, while lacking the grandeur of St George's, is a smart, new stadium (built in 2005) with potential to expand its 6,912 capacity.

SQUAD

Hasselbaink's predecessor Gary Rowett, who left to take the Birmingham City job last month, has built a squad more than capable of mounting an automatic promotion challenge.

In his two-and-a-half years at the club, Rowett steadily improved the quality of the playing staff, mainly bringing in free transfers and loans to achieve successive play-off finishes. Burton lost to Fleetwood in the League Two final at Wembley in May and at the semi-final stage the year before.

Under Clough, in charge from 1998 to 2009, and Paul Peschisolido, who oversaw their first Football League season in 2009-10 before being sacked in March 2012, Burton were reliant on journeymen brought in using the contacts of those two ex-players.

Hasselbaink though will find plenty of youth and energy in his squad.

Wingers Alex MacDonald, 24, and Lucas Akins, 25, are both vital to the way Burton were playing under Rowett, while academy product Matt Palmer is a promising midfielder.

There is experience in the backline with the presence of Ian Sharps and Shane Cansdell-Sheriff - a Leeds academy product during their halcyon days under David O'Leary which Hasselbaink was a part of - while captain Lee Bell is an assured performer in midfield.

But the man who will surely be most excited about working with Hasselbaink is striker Stuart Beavon. The 30-year-old ex-Wycombe man took the step down from League One to join on a free from Preston in the summer but has scored just three times this season.

Beavon has the pedigree to fire Burton to promotion if he can strike an understanding with MacDonald, Akins and former Aston Villa youngster Adam McGurk in the attacking third.

FORM

Burton, as they have been for the last two seasons, are cemented in the League Two play-off positions. Hasselbaink's new side sit fifth in the table but are just three points off leaders Wycombe and have a five-point cushion to the chasing pack.

Their form over the last two months has been poor though.

The Brewers picked up 19 points from a possible 21 in their opening seven games but the next nine games have yielded just 10 more, with only three wins in that time.

When Rowett, heralded as one of the brightest young British managers in the Football League, left Burton, they were already in a downward spiral.

Burton's inconsistent performances continued under caretaker Mike Whitlow and they were thumped 5-0 in the FA Cup first round by League One Barnsley on Saturday.

They have in fact lost nine of their last 13 games in all competitions.

Everything is in place for Hasselbaink and his assistant David Oldfield to guide Burton Albion to League One, but first they must deal with the club's recent slump.

His start couldn't be tougher. Burton travel to table-topping Wycombe on Monday night before facing second-placed Luton and third-placed Shrewsbury.
