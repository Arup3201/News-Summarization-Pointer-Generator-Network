You can play Championship Manager. You can be a Zoo Tycoon. But there is no such game as Fantasy Executive Chairman.

And do you know why? Because you’ve sort of got power, but you haven’t.

The manager: he decides what happens on the football field. He picks the team, he devises the playing strategy, the fans recognise this and, during the good times, sing his name.

Star of the show? Or was Nicola Cortese just the Liebherr family's banker at Southampton?

The owner: he provides the money. Ultimately, he signs the cheques. He tells the manager who he can buy and for how much. He hires and fires.

The executive chairman, or chief executive? Well, ostensibly, he’s in charge; except he never picks the team and his business plan relies entirely on the patronage of a higher authority.

Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the Premier League, is supposedly the most powerful man in football. Yet his power only goes so far. Scudamore consistently opposes the loan system but loses whenever he puts the issue to the vote before his Premier League chairmen. He is the boss right up to the point where the people calling the shots say ‘no thank you’.

Nicola Cortese found that out this week 
when a very rich woman decided she could spend her  fortune, or not, 
without his assistance. He really should have known. One of his final 
statements as Southampton’s executive chairman spoke of his manager 
Mauricio Pochettino in the coldest terms.

‘The manager is basically a department 
head like the others,’ he told a Leaders in Football  conference. With a
 stunning lack of self-awareness, he forgot that this was all he was, 
too. He might have been the head of the department heads but he was an 
employee just the same. It wasn’t his money, he merely acted as if it 
was.

Technically, he is correct about 
managers, although he failed to acknowledge that if the head of the 
football department fails he takes just about every other department 
down with him.

It is hard to run an efficient commercial
 or financial operation from bottom of the league because revenues will 
be affected. Southampton have long had a well-structured and successful 
academy; they did not have much opportunity to showcase this, however, 
because they kept getting relegated.

Then a wonderful person turned up, a true
 saviour. Not Cortese but Markus Liebherr, a Swiss  billionaire who had 
made his money in crane and construction equipment and was now in the 
mood for a little fun. He barely got to have it. Liebherr bought 
Southampton on July 8, 2009, removing it from administration, and died 
of a heart attack on August 10, 2010. In this brief period he had 
installed an ambitious young banker as executive chairman.

Cortese had impressed, most recently, at Banque Heritage in Geneva and had a background on the financial side of sport and entertainment.

Saviour? Swiss billionaire Markus Liebherr bought Southampton and removed them from administration

After Liebherr’s death, his shattered family pledged to continue supporting Southampton to honour their father’s vision and, as this was to make the club a presence in the Champions League, that meant honouring Cortese’s vision, too.

He proved an excellent administrator and Southampton returned to the Premier League through two divisions.

Alan Pardew did his bit, and more significantly Nigel Adkins, who won both promotions.

Yet Cortese’s managers never seemed to get much of a mention when he did his interviews. He was part of a new breed: the manager-chairman. He spoke as if Southampton was a one-man show — and he was the star.

Occasionally stories would appear linking him with a move to AC Milan or another top club as if he was a player. The first inkling of trouble ahead this week came when those rumours resurfaced on  Monday. And what seemed to be forgotten in all this was that the bill for Cortese’s grand plan — impressive though it was — always landed at the door of Liebherr’s daughter, Katharina. Without her, Cortese might as well have been playing a computer game.

One anecdote retold in newspapers on Friday detailed Katharina’s only previous meeting with manager Pochettino before Thursday’s five-minute conversation in the wake of Cortese’s departure. It took place at a dinner for staff and players at the Four Seasons Hotel, arranged by Cortese.

Talented squad: But without the necessary investment, Southampton wouldn't have been able to spend

Katharina Liebherr was present too, it was reported. Indeed, because she was paying for it.  Big-hearted Charlie was in the chair as usual, but it was Liebherr money he was spending: £14million to buy the club, £38m in loans converted to equity and £75m on players over five years. Cortese did a fine job but that is all it was, a job.

He invested a rich man’s money, as bankers do, for a fee. In the season Southampton returned to the Premier League, Cortese received £1.6m.

And Katharina Liebherr may prove to be a dud, by comparison. She may have no interest in football and might no longer feel the emotional pull that existed when her father died; it is now suggested she wants to sell. This would be a great pity.

But, as Cortese of all people would 
understand, it’s also business. Sometimes rich people like to cash in. 
As long as she doesn’t want to change the colours to blue, move 
Southampton to the Isle of Wight or sell to a crook, that’s her 
prerogative.

Impressive? Nicola Cortese did a good job at Southampton but needed financial backing to do so

So what happens from here? The prediction was for a tearful exodus of distraught staff and players but Pochettino needed five minutes with his new boss on Thursday to decide he was staying.

He will  consider his position at the end of the season, he says, but would have done that anyway. With significant investment needed to secure Champions League football, Southampton will soon hit the glass ceiling.

If Pochettino gets a better offer, a 
club with greater potential, he may angle to leave. He may even use 
Cortese’s departure as his cover story, but it will be a ruse. Few 
coaches, and no players, quit over the demise of an executive chairman, 
no matter how visionary.

Successful youth policy: Gareth Bale and Theo Walcott showed Southampton only needed money to progress

Cortese has been good for Southampton, but his was hardly a lone mission. By the time he arrived in 2009 Theo Walcott was at Arsenal, Gareth Bale was at Tottenham Hotspur, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain was established enough to be sold within the year and Adam Lallana had been a professional there since 2006.

This was a club with a successful, established youth policy, a strong fan base and a new ground, languishing in League One due to poor financial management.

Money restored the natural order, Liebherr money, and Cortese spent it well, as the best bankers do. That’s why billionaires use them.
