The foster brother who sexually assaulted Joshua Komisarjevsky as a child admitted to a doctor 'things happened that shouldn't have happened of a sexual nature', a psychologist testified today.

Massachusetts-based psychologist Leslie Lebowitz testified in the sentencing phase of Joshua Komisarjevsky's murder trial, claiming that childhood trauma led him to a life of crime.

Komisarjevsky, 31, was convicted of killing Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters in their Cheshire home in 2007. The girls died of smoke inhalation after the house was doused in gas and set on fire.

Taking the stand for a second day, Ms Lebowitz recalled how Komisarjevsky's his devoutly Christian parents told him that homosexual sex is a sin, leading the cold blooded killer to believe he was condemned to hell after he was allegedly raped at age 14 by Scott Reetz - 11 years his senior.

Reetz was taken in by the Komisarjevskys as a teenager in the 1980s. The family had adopted Joshua when he was Komisarjevsky was two-weeks-old.

On Tuesday, Ms Lebowitz testified she interviewed Reetz for an evauluation requested by the defence team.

She concluded that he was 'very visibly impaired' and 'not verbal' during their sit-down.

According to a Courant.com report, Ms Lebowitz said she asked Reetz about specific sexual abuse but he would say only, 'Yes, something like that might have happened'.

She said he admitted to 'posing games' and that regretted showing Komisarjevsky his body parts. He told her he was 'curious about sex' at the time.

Defence lawyers, who are trying to spare Komisarjevsky from being given the death penalty, have argued the Komisarjevskys, a deeply religious and strict family, opposed psychological counselling or medications that could have helped their son after the incident.

Ms Lebowitz testified that when asked about family patriarch Ben Komisarjevsky, Reetz told her he was 'angry a lot'.

She also said that she interviewed 
Joshua Komisarjevsky's mother, Jude, who said she had suspected Reetz 
was abusing other children in the family home - a sentiment that was 
solidified when Ms Lebowitz interviewed a foster daughter who lived in 
the home with Reetz. According to the doctor, the woman recalled how 
Reetz 'put a pillow over her head and raped her' when she lived with the
 family.

Reetz is on Connecticut's sex offender registry, convicted in 1993 of sexual assault in an unrelated case.

Family members told Ms Lebowitz 
Komisarjevsky took a 'downward turn'after a head injury
 when he was about nine, and after a series of deaths of men he was 
close to. She said he saw saw 'an embodiment of terror' that appeared as
 a shadow in his bedroom, and that he would run into the woods to escape
 it.

Komisarjevsky told her he 
had been raped by 'an important friend' that made him feel 'dead and 
completely out of control', and began self-mutilating.

In 1996, he was sent to a religious 
residential treatment home for boys in Vermont called The Fold; during 
his stay he started a fire at a gas station and began running away and 
taking drugs, family said.

Prosecutor Gary Nicholson
 asked Ms Lebowitz during cross-examination if she thought Scott Reetz had 
obvious mental disabilities, which she affirmed.

Ms Lebowitz admitted that she wrote 
her report only on the first 15 years of Komisarjevsky's life and did 
not write about his use of illegal drugs, including hallucinogenic LSD.

She said she believed Komisarjevsky's hallucinations preceded his use of the drug.

Mr Nicholson questioned her 
allegation during Monday's testimony that Komisarjevsky was sexually assaulted 'not every day, but a 
lot', and her recollection of Komisarjevsky's statements that he had 
been anally raped on numerous occasions, forced to pose in sexual 
positions with his sister, and his chest burned with cigarettes by Reetz.

Ms Lebowitz confirmed Joshua was the only person who made those allegations.

Sexual abuse claims have been heard throughout the evidence and sentencing phases of Komisarjevsky's trial.

Turning point: Joshua Komisarjevsky  sorted his life out for a while and completed Army Reserve training

His sister, whose named is being 
withheld by MailOnline, appeared in court on her brother's behalf last 
month despite her claims he sexually abused her as a child.

The sister said her parents worried she or her brother could be removed from the home if they sought counselling.

The woman testified her brother had 
sexually abused her for up to two years, ending when she was about ten 
and he was about 12, when she finally spoke out.

Accomplice: Steven Hayes is already on death row for the killings

She told prosecutor Michael Dearington she saw the abuse 'not as violence but an act of control'.

His sister said under 
cross-examination from prosecutors that she turned out successful while 
growing up in the same household and 'in spite of' suffering sexual 
abuse.

Komisarjevsky's attorneys have said 
he was also abused as a teen by someone else other than his foster 
brother; prosecutors say those claims came from Komisarjevsky and 
emerged years later when he faced prison time for 19 nighttime 
residential burglaries.

His sister said she knew nothing of 
his abuse until after he was arrested in the Cheshire home invasion 
killings, but has never spoken to Komisarjevsky about the incident.

Komisarjevsky was found guilty of 17 
counts on October 13 for the grisly murders of Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48,
 and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, and the vicious 
beating of their father, Dr. William Petit,.

He has blamed his accomplice for most
 of the grisly murders. He said Steven Hayes broke into the Petit home 
early on July 23, 2007 after Komisarjevsky spotted Michaela Petit in a 
grocery store and made her his target.

Later that morning, Mrs Hawke-Petit 
drove to a bank, where she told a teller her family was being held 
hostage and she needed $15,000 to pay off the captors.

A bank manager called police but when
 authorities arrived at the Petit home, it was engulfed in flames. The 
police have been criticised as being slow to respond.

The only survivor, Dr William Petit, was badly beaten and bound but managed to escape as the house was set on fire.

In the burning house were his 
daughters, who died of smoke inhalation, and the body of his wife, who 
had been raped and strangled. The younger girl had been sexually 
assaulted.

Hayley Petit's body was found at the top of the staircase. Her sister's body was found still in her bed.

And while Superior Court Judge Jon C 
Blue is deciding if Komisarjevsky's nine-year-old daughter should 
testify in the death penalty phase of the trial, his girlfriend at the 
time of the home invasion has told of a very different man than the 
brutal killer who committed the triple murders.

She told RadarOnline.com about her experiences dating Komisarjevsky, whom she called a 'great dad' and a caring single father.Â 

He was granted sole custody of the 
girl, then five, two months before the murders after being embroiled in a
 bitter custody battle with her mother, Jennifer Norton, who was being 
treated at a crisis intervention unit, reports Radar.

The girl could play a major role in 
the jury's decision and sources have said that defence attorneys have 
subpoenaed the girl, who now lives with one of her mother's relatives.

It was revealed in March that she would be called to testify either during the evidence portion or the penalty phase.

Her grandparents asked that her name 
be redacted from the witness list in April after she received a 
threatening letter at their Cheshire home.

Judge Blue said earlier today that defence attorneys have subpoenaed the judge who sentenced Komisarjevksy 
for other crimes in 2002. An attorney from the attorney general's office
 is trying to quash the subpoena.

A hearing has been set for November 14.
