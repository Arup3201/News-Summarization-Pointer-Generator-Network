Control: Shannon Ivey gained control of the runaway bus after the unresponsive driver, Aubrey Liverpool, 62, began groaning and lay motionless at the controls

Assistance: Ivey opened the folding door while the bus was moving, allowing two men outside to come and help the bus driver

Help: A man unbuckles Liverpool's seatbelt during the incredible rescue at the intersection of 56th Street and Busch Boulevard, in Florida

The mom's quick reactions were caught on surveillance footage and are being credited with preventing the accident from becoming much worst. 

According to Fox 13, Ivey was travelling five cars behind the bus and caught sight of someone banging on the vehicle's door. 

The driver of the truck that had just been hit by the bus had gotten out of his vehicle to talk to Liverpool, but could not get his attention. 

He spotted Liverpool slumped down in his chair and groaning inside the bus.

Ivey said: 'The light turned green, everybody started going, just kind of going around [the accident]. We saw a gentleman banging on the bus door.'

Kenneth Pierce, Ivey's fiancé, told the TV station: 'It's like a gut feeling. I don't know how to describe it too much. (I just thought) 'Get this guy out. Help him.'

The truck driver yelled at the other drivers for help. 

Rescue: The men carried Liverpool out of the bus but when they had him on the ground, he wanted to get up

Sick: 'He was passed out and unresponsive,' Ivey told Fox 13 News. 'His tongue was sticking out'

Recovery: The rescuers stayed with Liverpool until an ambulance arrived. He was released from the hospital on Friday afternoon and is expected to recover 

'He was basically screaming 'Help! Call 911!'' said Pierce who was in the car with her and their eighth grade son Aaron.

They ran to the bus and attempted to prize open the door but couldn't as the bus began to roll backwards.

Dramatic footage caught on surveillance camera shows Ivey climb through the driver's side window, and grab the wheel in front of the driver. 

She then opened the folding door while the bus was moving, allowing two men waited outside on the Florida road to come and help the bus driver.  

Once inside a man turned off the ignition and put the bus in park as another unbuckled Liverpool's seat belt and began to pull the unconscious driver out of his seat.

'He was passed out and unresponsive,' Ivey told Fox 13 News. 'His tongue was sticking out.'

The men carried Liverpool out of the bus but when they had him on the ground, he wanted to get up.
