It’s not a sight you see every day - priests base jumping from high buildings.

But this is the view that greeted onlookers as four - seemingly - men of the cloth leaped from Warsaw’s Palace of Culture.

However, the extreme sports team - called No Limits - are phoney Fathers; they dress up as priests so they can smuggle their parachutes past the building’s security.

This two-minute, 25-second footage reveals the men dressed in cassocks, climbing to the top of the highest building in Poland.

The voiceover reveals: ‘Once safely inside the building, they take the lift to the top floor.

‘And after a quick reccy of their jump site, they cram into the small toilet to make their preparations - making signs of the cross and giving each other high fives.

‘Then as passers-by watch in amazement, they climb on to the ledge, where there's no turning back.’

Leap of faith: The extreme sports group - called No Limits - then jump from the building

 Daring: The jump was captured on camera, giving viewers a bird’s eye view across Warsaw

One of the men can be heard saying to onlookers: 'It's OK, it's OK.’

And then the men jump, with cameras attached to a pole, giving viewers a bird's eye view across Warsaw.

After they land in a nearby car park, the phoney Fathers can then be seen tidying away their parachutes.

They then make a quick getaway in a car.
