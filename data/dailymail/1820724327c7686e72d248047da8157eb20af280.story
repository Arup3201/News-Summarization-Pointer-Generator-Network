DNA - the building blocks of life - has been turned into literal building blocks, like very, very small Lego, creating an alphabet where each letter is 1,000th the thickness of a human hair.

Researchers at Harvard have come up with a method for building tiny structures out of synethetic DNA strands, which are programmed to assemble themselves into the alphabet.

But this isn't just scientists showing off - the method could be used to create tiny organic 'machines' that swim inside the human body to deliver drugs directly to diseased areas.

Researchers at the Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired
Engineering at Harvard University have developed a method for building complex
nanostructures out of short synthetic strands of DNA.

Called single-stranded
tiles (SSTs), these interlocking DNA 'building blocks' could be the foundation of future generations of organic machines. 

DNA is best known as a keeper of genetic information - but scientists are increasingly investigating it as a way to 'build' tiny organic structures for use inside the body.

But in
an emerging field of science known as DNA nanotechnology, it is being explored
for use as a material with which to build tiny, programmable structures to 'build' objects.

To date, most research has focused on the use of a single
long biological strand of DNA, which acts as a backbone along which smaller
strands bind to its many different segments, to create shapes - a method called DNA origami.

In focusing on the use of short strands of synthetic DNA and
avoiding the long scaffold strand, Yin's team developed an alternative building
method.

Each SST is a single, short strand of DNA. One tile will interlock with
another tile, if it has a complementary sequence of DNA. If there are no
complementary matches, the blocks do not connect. In this way, a collection of
tiles can assemble itself into specific, predetermined shapes.

In demonstrating the method, the researchers created just
over one hundred different designs, including Chinese characters, numbers, and
fonts, using hundreds of tiles for a single structure of 100 nanometers
(billionths of a meter) in size. The approach is simple, robust, and versatile.

'Use of DNA nanotechnology to create programmable
nanodevices is an important focus at the Wyss Institute, because we believe so
strongly in its potential to produce a paradigm-shifting approach to
development of new diagnostics and therapeutics,' said Wyss Founding
Director, Donald Ingber, M.D., Ph.D
