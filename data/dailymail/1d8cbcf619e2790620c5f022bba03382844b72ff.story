Confession: PC Christopher Kelly admitted attacking Michael Ijomanta (pictured), hurling a glass in his face and splitting his eyeball in two

A police officer split a man's eyeball in two leaving him blind in one eye after hurling a glass in his face when a brawl broke out a wedding.

Constable Christopher Kelly, 28, smashed a tumbler into Michael Ijomanta's face causing two shards of glass to become lodged in his eye, and cuts all over his face.

The PC, who is based in south Glasgow, admitted attacking Mr Ijomanta when a fight broke out at the Crutherland House Hotel in East Kilbride, Lanarkshire.

Kelly, of Cambuslang, was one of 80 evening guests asked to the reception but ended the night on the other side of the cell door after detectives arrested him when called to reports of a disturbance.

On Friday, Kelly appeared at Hamilton Sheriff Court where he was smuggled into the court through a back door, before pleading guilty.

Mr Ijomanta, 34, who travelled from Northamptonshire for his cousin's wedding, was left blind in one eye and disfigured as a result of the horrific injury.

Prosecutor Natalie Henderson told the court Mr Ijomanta had been on the dance floor when an argument broke out shortly after midnight.

She said: 'The argument became more heated and a scuffle broke out.

'The complainer made his way to the circle as he was concerned for the safety of his mother and family.

'There was a lot of pushing and shoving and the accused felt himself being pushed.

'The accused had a glass tumbler in his hand and as a result he turned and threw the tumbler in the direction he thought he had been pushed from.

'The glass went directly into the face of the complainer who was standing three feet away.

'The glass shattered on impact and the complainer fell to the ground screaming and holding his face.'

Paramedics were called and Mr Ijomanta was taken to Hairmyres Hospital in East Kilbride.

There, doctors discovered two pieces of glass stuck in his eye, and treated cuts to his forehead, cheek and nose.

Ms Henderson added: 'His eye had two pieces of glass in it and the eyeball was almost split in two.

'A surgeon who has been working for 16 years described the injuries as one of the worst he had ever seen.

'The accused was later interviewed and then charged where he made no comment.'

PC Kelly, based in Glasgow's south side, was held in custody overnight by detectives.

The court heard he had been allowed to work despite the charges he faced.

Sheriff Shiona Waldron deferred sentence until next month and called for the probation service to compile reports.

She warned Kelly, who has served as an officer for nearly four years, he faces jail but granted him bail.

She added: 'You should be in no doubt what the likely outcome of this will be.'

Mr Ijomanta declined to comment outside court.
