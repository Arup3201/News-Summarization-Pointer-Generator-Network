Washington has been wasting millions of tax dollars on massages for rabbits, tweeting terrorists and teaching sea monkeys synchronised swimming, a U.S. senator claims.

Oklahoma senator Tom Coburn has just released his annual Wastebook where he outlines, in his opinion, $25billion of the U.S. government's 'worst spending of the year'.

The list of government projects include a $500,000 project to encourage butterfly farming and $856,000 to study the movement of mountain lions which saw eight months spent on teaching them to run on a treadmill.

No more waste: Republican senator Tom Coburn has outlined 100 examples of what he believes is the U.S. government's 'worst spending of the year'

Coburn's tome, 'Wastebook 2014: What Washington doesn't want you to read', outlines 100 tax-funded projects this year.

Coburn is a Republican senator who opposes same-sex marriage and abortion, and voted against a bill which would have expanded background checks for Americans purchasing guns and other firearms.

Since his election in 2005 he has relentlessly chased up what he considers to be 'government waste'.

'Only someone with too much of someone else's money and not enough accountability for how it was being spent could come up some of these projects,' Coburn said of his 2014 Wastebook.

The 100 projects include a $387,000 'Swedish massages for bunnies' grant, however it is not quite the luxury pet spa project Coburn makes it out to be.

The two year project at the Ohio State University Sports Medicine Center saw the rabbits given rubdowns after being subjected to exercise, to see the impact of massages on muscle recovery.

A $10,000 agricultural project gets rapped by Coburn as he claims it's 'money to watch grass grow'.

Technically, this is indeed true, the Department of Interior’s U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is paying for 'the cost to monitor grasses' in the Guana Tolomato Matanzas National Estuarine Research Reserve in Florida.

However, this particular species of cordgrass, known formally as Spartina alterniflora, is vital for the survival of swaps, and the project will end in a 'guide on best practices for cultivating the cordgrass'.

Also on the list is a study at the University of California Santa Cruz was awarded a $856,000 National Science Foundation grant to study the movements of mountain lions.

This involved getting three captive mountain lions to use a treadmill, and it took eight months before they were 'comfortable' on the exercise machine so the study could commence.

Another animal-focused item on Coburn's list is a study looking at the effects of sea monkeys' swimming patterns on water movement which was awarded $50,000.

Although the 'Wastebook' covers the tax-funded grants for business, such as dairy farms looking to increase ice cream production, Coburn does not follow up on how much could be returned to the state in the form of taxes paid, or the potential for new jobs being created if the businesses are successful as a result of the grants.

However, in one instance the Agriculture Department handed a town on a Native American reservation $500,000 to raise and sell butterflies, but as of August, only 50 of the 845 tribe members had signed up.

Coburn goes all out claiming the U.S. taxpayer is helping Disney renovate it's Polynesian Village resort.

Although the Small Business Administration has provided $1.4million in surety bond guarantees to support the massive renovation at the Walt Disney World Resort, the money is set to support two of the firms hired by Disney to do the work - not Disney World itself.

Senator Coburn, a physician, announced in January he is retiring from the Senate next year, due to ongoing health issues.
