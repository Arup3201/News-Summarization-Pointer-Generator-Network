Liverpool forward Luis Suarez has been voted the 2014 Footballer of the Year by the Football Writers' Association.

The Uruguay international, 27, topped the poll of 300-plus journalists with a victory over Anfield team-mate Steven Gerrard, the England captain.

Suarez's 30 goals have helped propel Brendan Rodgers' men towards a first championship in 24 years.

The Liverpool forward will be honoured
 with the prestigious FWA accolade, which has been running since 1948, 
at a gala dinner at the Lancaster London Hotel on May 15.

Suarez was last week also named Player of the Year by the Professional Footballers' Association.

FWA
 chairman Andy Dunn said: 'Those members who have
 been fortunate enough to be working at a match involving Luis Suarez 
have witnessed an astonishing talent first-hand.

'Tireless
 endeavour allied to extraordinary imagination makes an irresistible 
combination. Add ingenious, impudent finishing and you have a footballer
 who truly quickens the pulse.

'Luis is a remarkably gifted addition to the long and distinguished list of winners of our award.'

In
 a poll that saw 10 different players collect votes, Suarez collected 52
 per cent of the overall vote, ahead of his club captain, Gerrard, with 
Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure in third place.

Suarez received two votes in last year's FWA poll, which was won by then Tottenham winger Gareth Bale, and has come full circle since serving a 10-match ban for biting Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic.

Dunn added on Sky Sports News: 'There was a groundswell of support for him last season, but our voting opened 12 hours after the biting incident at Anfield, so I think that was taken into account.

'I must stress the importance in this award that the football writers are asked to base their decision on obviously the footballing contribution throughout the season, but also to take into account the player's behaviour - the original citation for the FWA award back in 1947/48 mentioned 'precept and example', so that is taken into account.

'While no-one would say Suarez is whiter than white, you would have to say his behaviour all throughout the season has been very good and I think the football writers have taken that into account, an element of redemption if you like, and allied with those 30 goals, and the sensational talent he has displayed all season, that made him a very, very popular choice.'
