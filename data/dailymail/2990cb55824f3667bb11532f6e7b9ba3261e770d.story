Cruel parents who kept their child locked in a cage are being investigated by police in Mexico City.

Mother Lisette Guzman Montoya, 28, and father Menajem Jurado, 33, were exposed after a local political party's campaign team knocked on their door in the district of Miguel Hidalgo.

Politician Evaristo Roberto Candia Ortega, who later tweeted a photo of the boy, said: ‘Our people knocked on the door and as they waited they heard a child crying.

Evaristo Roberto Candia Ortega tweeted this shocking photo of the abused boy in a bid to help police find him and bring his 'drug addict' parents to justice in Mexico City

‘When they looked round the corner of the house they saw a little boy standing in a cage weeping with a dog chained to it.’

After getting no response from knocking on the door, the campaign team decided to take a photograph of the shocking scene.

As they did, somebody came out of the house and was very aggressive towards them.

‘It was clear to my party colleagues that the man was either on drugs or very drunk,’ said Candia Ortega.

'I find it disgusting that anyone would lock up their child and leave him in those conditions,' said Evaristo Roberto Candia Ortega

The campaign team decided to leave and called the police.

When they returned with the police the place was empty and both the child and dog had gone.

So far the police have failed to find the boy or his parents and as a result Candia Ortega had decided to post the photograph on Twitter.

‘I put the photograph onto Twitter because I want these people found,’ he said. ‘I find it disgusting that anyone would lock up their child and leave him in those conditions.’

According to Candia Ortega, his team spoke to the parents' neighbors who told them that the couple were drug addicts and often put the boy inside the cage because they didn't want to look after him.

He described their actions as ‘deplorable.’

Local police have said they are doing everything possible to find the boy and charge his parents.

‘We are aware of who these people are and are diverting resources into finding them as quickly as we can so that the little boy will be safe,’ said a police spokesperson.

In June, police in Mexican town of Xalapa found a four-year-old boy who had been chained to the bars of the balcony as a form of punishment.
