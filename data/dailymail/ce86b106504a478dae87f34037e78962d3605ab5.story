A new generation of mollycoddled children are unable to cope in adulthood, David Cameron’s new adviser on childhood said last night.

MP Claire Perry criticised the paradox of parents being over-controlling in their children’s lives, while at the same time giving them limitless access to the internet - where she says, the real dangers lie.

Every moment of a child’s life is filled with organised activities, leaving young people unable to fend for themselves when they leave home or go to university, the 48-year-old mother of three said.

Yet at the same time, many children are given few restrictions when it comes to the internet.

‘We’ve created a treadmill,’ she said. ‘It’s usually the mother that is orchestrating all of that and doing all the driving.

‘We have created rods for our own back. Children need time to be bored.’

When discussing the internet, Mrs Perry, the Prime Minister’s adviser on the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood, told The Times newspaper: ‘Most parents are too busy, don’t know the words, aren’t aware their children are doing it.

‘They are living in digital oblivion,’ she said.

Her remarks on parenting are in sharp contrast to those of many other politicians, who are more likely to praise parents’ efforts.

The MP for Devizes, also criticised the sexism in political life, during an interview with The Times newspaper.

Before she entered politics, Mrs Perry worked in the banking and finance industry, which despite its reputation for being chauvinistic, was far more meritocratic than British politics, she said.

Mrs Perry took a seven-year break from her career in management consulting when her children were young but admitted that she was guilty of ‘hovering’ over them too much when she was at home.

She said that when mother’s do too much for their children, they struggle when they leave home and realise they haven’t got a mother to help them with their homework, watching their every move.

The new trend of 1950s-style homemaking has added to the burden on today’s mothers, she said.

‘We fetishise cupcakes ... I like baking but I don’t want to make that my life’s purpose. We worship this feminine motherhood thing and I don’t think our children have benefited actually. They’re babied a lot.’

Mrs Perry added that, despite the intense focus on children’s lives, parents were often afraid to lay down the law.

‘Good parenting isn’t just about making sure they come top in maths but all the difficult stuff too. If they don’t learn the limits from us who is going to tell them?’

Mrs Perry’s decision to criticise today’s parenting methods was criticised by some campaigners last night.

Justine Roberts, co-founder of the Mumsnet forum told The Times: ‘Mothers are, sadly, used to copping a lot of blame but being charged with being over-protective, cupcake-baking helicopter parents at the same time as being feckless, couch potatoes who let their children have unfettered internet access is a bit rich.

‘Politicians could more usefully perhaps focus on improving local schools, job prospects, childcare options and flexible work solutions than telling us how to be better parents.’

Mrs Perry has been leading the Government’s campaign to persuade broadband providers and internet companies to adopt an "opt in” filter, which would automatically block pornography and other adult content unless subscribers specifically request it.
