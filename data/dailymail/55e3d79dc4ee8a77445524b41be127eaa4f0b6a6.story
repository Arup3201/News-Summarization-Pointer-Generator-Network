Sir Bradley Wiggins was third on the short time-trial stage of the Tour of Qatar on Tuesday.

The Olympic time-trial champion, riding for Team Sky and wearing the world champion's rainbow jersey he won last September for the first time in competition, finished the 10-kilometre Lusail Circuit course in 14 minutes 12 seconds, nine seconds behind stage winner Niki Terpstra.

Fabian Cancellara was second, eight seconds behind Dutchman Terpstra, who took the overall lead.

Wiggins' major target is Paris-Roubaix, which takes place on April 12 and is his final race for Team Sky before he switches emphasis to the track.

He told cyclingweekly.co.uk: 'I'd love to win Roubaix, but it's so unpredictable.

'I'd love to moonwalk as well, but sometimes you have to accept you can't do certain things in life.

'It won't be for the lack of trying - same as if I took lessons to try to learn to moonwalk, although I'll never do it to the extent of Michael (Jackson, the pop star).'
