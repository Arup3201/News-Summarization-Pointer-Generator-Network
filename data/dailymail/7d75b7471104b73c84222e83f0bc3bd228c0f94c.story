Nigel Farage today threw away the chance to become an MP within weeks as he ruled himself out of standing in a crunch by-election.

Opponents accused the Ukip leader of 'bottling it' and being 'frit' after announcing he would not be the party's candidate in the Tory seat of Newark vacated by shamed MP Patrick Mercer.

Last night Mr Farage claimed David Cameron would have to resign as Prime Minister if he won the seat for Ukip, but today he confirmed he would not be on the ballot paper.

Senior Tories will breath a sigh of relief at the decision not to field Mr Farage in Newark.

The Conservatives secured a majority of 16,000 in the seat at the last election, but bookmakers said Ukip were just 2/1 to win Newark in a by-election, with the Tories favourites at 4/5.

Labour frontbencher Rachel Reeves said: 'I'm not surprised that Nigel Farage doesn't want to fight in Newark.

'He bottles it when there's a real contest, and when he has a chance to prove that people want him as a member of parliament he backs away and he's done that again.'

Tory defence minister Anna Soubry said on Twitter: 'Niger Farage is not stupid - he knows he'd lose and runs frit from Newark!'

But Mr Farage claimed that putting his own name forward for the seat would cause a 'distraction' from the party's bid to win the European Parliament elections on May 22.

A by-election has been rumoured since the cash-for-questions scandal broke last summer.

But in a statement outside a pub in Bath this morning, Mr Farage claimed he had not had long to consider whether or not to run.

'I have no doubt that UKIP will throw the
 kitchen sink at this Newark by-election, but it won’t be me doing it 
and we won’t get that huge distraction,' he told BBC Breakfast.

'It was only 12 hours ago that Patrick Mercer stood down so I haven’t had long to think about it, but I have thought about it and we’re just over three weeks away from a European election at which I think UKIP can cause an earthquake in British politics, from which we can go on and not just win one parliamentary seat but win quite a lot of parliamentary seats.

'And for that reason I don’t want to do anything that deflects from the European election campaign so I’m not going to stand in this by-election.

'I want to focus the next three weeks on winning the European elections and also I don’t have any links with the east Midlands; I would just look like an opportunist and I don’t think that would work.'

The prospect of Mr Farage standing for Parliament emerged last night as he addressed a meeting of Ukip supporters in Bath

Tory defence minister Anna Soubry accused Mr Farage of being 'frit', an insult used by Margaret Thatcher against Labour

Ukip strategists are examining how the Reform party in Canada used a by-election as a springboard to becoming a dominant political force.

Local teacher Deborah Grey won Reform's first seat in Parliament in 1989, and four years later the party overtook the Progressive Conservatives as the main right-wing party.

Other names in the frame to fight the seat are communities spokesman Suzanne Evans, viewed as a strong media performer, and Ukip MEP Roger Helmer.

Mr Helmer, a former Tory, has been an MEP in the East Midlands since 1999.

But he has often sparked controversy, just yesterday making headlines for saying it was acceptable to dislike gay people.

Later he appeared to admit part of the reason he did not stand was he did not think he would win.

He told Sky News: 'I'm not sure electorally it would have worked anyway.'

The seat went to Labour in 1997 during the first Tony Blair landslide but returned to the Tories in 2001.

Last night Mr Farage told the BBC that if he stood and won Mr Cameron would 'have to resign' but if he lost Ukip would be finished: 'The bubble is burst.'

The Tories were quick to seize on Mr Farage's decision as proof he lacked the will to fight a difficult election.

Asked on Sky News 'The question is have you bottled it?' Mr Farage replied: 'Yes.'

Conservative Cabinet minister Ken Clarke, who represents the neighbouring Nottinghamshire seat of Rushcliffe, said Mr Farage had backed out because he knew he could not win.

'I am not really surprised. Whatever else Nigel is, he is not an idiot and I don't think he'd have the faintest chance of winning in Newark,' Mr Clarke told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

'I don't think Ukip will get anywhere in the by-election.

'I don't think the residents of Newark - some of whom I know because I used to represent some of the villages there - they're not going to vote for a card who's larking about trying to get protest votes.'

It follows Mr Farage also refusing to stand in the Eastleigh by-election triggered by Lib Dem Chris Huhne's resignation and in the Labour seat of Wythenshawe and Sale.

Local
 Tories scotched suggestions of Boris Johnson being selected, saying 
they had already chosen businessman Robert Jenrick to fight the seat.

And Labour was at pains to stress that it last held the seat before boundary changes, and played down any prospect of winning the by-election.

Former Tory MP Patrick Mercer speaks outside the House of Commons, London, as he announces his resignation

Mr Mercer, an 
outspoken critic of David Cameron, quit the Tory party in July after he was exposed as having accepted £4,000 to ask Parliamentary 
questions and lobby on behalf of Fiji.

He referred himself to Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards and 
promised to quit the Commons at the next election.

But
 the standards watchdog is expected to recommend he be suspended from 
the Commons for six months in a damning report tomorrow.

In
 a statement last night, Mr Mercer said he was ‘ashamed’ of his 
behaviour. The former Army colonel said that as an ex-soldier he 
believes that when you have done something wrong you should confess to 
it.

He added: ‘No 
point in shilly- shallying or trying to avoid it. What has happened has 
happened, I’m ashamed of it. Therefore, I’m going to do what I can to 
put it right . . . I’m going to resign my seat.’

The market town of Newark lies on the River Trent in Nottinghamshire

In 2010 the Tories won 54 per cent of the vote, with Ukip securing just 4 per cent

Newark is a largely rural constituency which, since Patrick Mercer was elected in 2001, has been considered a safe Conservative seat.

Centred on the affluent cathedral town of Southwell and the market town of Newark, and dissected by the River Trent, around half of the area's 72,000 voters live in villages and rural areas.

It borders Labour-held Bassetlaw in the north and lies to the north east of a number of Labour-voting constituencies in the city of Nottingham.

But unlike Nottinghamshire's more urban areas, Newark has a traditionally Conservative-voting population, like that of its two neighbouring Lincolnshire constituencies, Gainsborough and Sleaford and North Hykeham, which border it to the east.

Newark's electorate is 93 per cent white British, and 67 per cent describe themselves as Christian, with less than one per cent considering themselves Hindu, Muslim, Sikh or Jewish.

More than 70 per cent of homes in the constituency either owned outright or mortgaged, less than 10 per cent of households have council or housing association tenants and only 20 per cent of the electorate are younger than 34.

Well over half of voters are employed, with nearly one in five retired and only three per cent unemployed.

Traditionally Tory, it was held by the party for the first half of the 20th century, but swung to Labour after the war, with Labour MPs George Deer and Edward Stanley Bishop representing it from 1950 to 1979.

It swung back to the Conservatives in 1979, with Tory Richard Alexander holding the seat until 1997, when Labour's Fiona Jones won a slim majority as Tony Blair swept to power.Mrs Jones could only hold the seat for one term however and Patrick Mercer won it back for the Tories in 2001.

At the last election, the Tories won 54 per cent of the vote, giving them a huge majority over Labour, who polled at only 24 per cent.
