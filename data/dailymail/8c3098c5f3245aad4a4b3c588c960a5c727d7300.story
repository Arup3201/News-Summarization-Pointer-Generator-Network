A Texan tycoon who defrauded almost £5 billion from investors and used his wealth to bankroll international cricket matches in England was jailed for 110 years yesterday.

Allen Stanford, who for 22 years ran investment scams with an estimated 17,000 victims, was once one of the richest men in America, worth more than £1.2 billion.

The courtroom in Houston was packed with many of his victims to hear the sentence handed down, the majority of whom were small business owners.

Two of the estimated 17,000 victims of Stanford’s fraud were allowed to address the court.

Jaime Escalona, who represented Latin 
American victims, addressed the hearing before turning to stare directly
at Stanford to tell him: 'You, sir, are a dirty, rotten, scoundrel.' 

The other victims’ spokesman, Angela 
Shaw, of the Stanford Victims Coalition, said of the fraudster: “Allen 
Stanford has stolen more than billions of dollars. He took our lives as 
we knew them.” She said some 28,000 people had lost money in the scam.

Yet, even in his final hour of shame 
the former tycoon couldn’t help but deny it all and to blame others. 
'I’m not a thief.....I did not defraud anybody,' he said.

'The US government are responsible 
ruining the business....they destroyed it and turned it to nothing. 
Stanford was a real brick-and-mortar global financial empire.'

Guilty: Stanford was convicted in March of 13 of 14 counts of fraud

Stanford now plans to appeal against the conviction and sentence even though he was officially declared “indigent” – penniless.

The court has now to appoint lawyers 
who will be funded out of a scheme similar to Britain’s own legal-aid 
and it is estimated to run into tens of millions of dollars.

During yesterday’s sentencing, 
Stanford’s 40-minute rambling account was the first time he had actually
spoken to the court about what had taken place during the 22-years his 
banking empire existed.

He claimed he was a scapegoat and 
blamed the federal government and a court-appointed receiver who took 
over his companies in 2009 for tearing down his business empire and 
preventing his investors from getting any of their money back.

He said: “ I’m not here to ask for 
sympathy or forgiveness or to throw myself at your mercy but I will tell
you I did not run a Ponzi scheme. I didn’t defraud anybody.”

Stanford was once considered one of 
the richest men in the U.S., with an estimated personal net worth of 
more than £1.2billion. His financial empire stretched from the U.S. to 
Latin America and the Caribbean.

Calling Stanford arrogant and without 
remorse, prosecutors said he used the money from investors who bought 
certificates of deposit, or CDs, from his bank in Antigua to fund a 
string of failed businesses, bribe regulators and pay for a lavish 
lifestyle that included yachts, a fleet of private jets and sponsorship 
of cricket tournaments.

Stanford added moments before being 
led away: “If I live the rest of my life in prison …. I will always be 
at peace with the way I conducted myself in business.”

Disgraced tycoon Stanford’s schemes 
were the second largest in US financial history – second only to Bernie 
Madoff, the so-called ‘King of Con’ - who was given 150 years for his 
£11.2-billion Ponzi scheme.

The majority of the victims were small businesses or private investors, looking to cash-in on interest rates above bank rate.

Mike Bishop, of Houston, Texas, who 
lost round £900,000 said outside the court: “ This was a wholesale 
failure by government agencies who regulate companies such as Stanford. 
They are as responsible.

“Here in Texas we believe in capital 
punishment but I would not wish it on Stanford, I want him to wake up 
every morning in his prison cell and reflect on what he did to us all.”

Stanford, ever the showman, entered the courtroom dressed in green prison fatigues and grinning all over his face.

When handcuffs were taken off he waved
to his elderly mother Sammie Stanford who sat in the well of the court 
alongside Stanford’s daughter Randi.

Prosecutors had asked the court for a 
sentence of 230 years in prison. The prosecutor told Judge David 
Hittner: “ 230 years will not get anyone their money back but on 
sleepless nights they will know that he got the maximum.”

In June 2008 Stanford signed a 
controversial deal with the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) for a 
series of five Twenty20 cricket games between England and a Caribbean 
side nicknamed the ‘Stanford All-Stars.’ The winners would collect a 
prize-fund of £13.6-million and the losers would get nothing.

During the tournament, Stanford was 
pictured sitting with the England players wives, at one sitting bouncing
the wife of wicketkeeper Matt Prior on his knee.

His next trick was to fly into Lords 
aboard a personalised helicopter laden with treasure chests of cash. He 
planned to be the saviour of English cricket, even though he admitted he
never really understood the game.

By the time of his arrest, in February
2009, the ECB has severed all ties with Stanford and his honorary 
knighthood provided by the government of Antigua had been stripped.

The jury that convicted Stanford also 
cleared the way for U.S. authorities to go after about £212-million in 
stolen investor funds sitting in the financier’s frozen foreign bank 
accounts in London, Canada and Switzerland.

Three other former Stanford executives
are scheduled for trial in September. A former Antiguan financial 
regulator was indicted and awaits extradition to the U.S.

Prosecutors said Stanford had treated 
his victims like “roadkill”. They had asked for a prison sentence 
spanning more than two centuries, calling him a “ruthless predator” who 
stole from investors “simply to satisfy his own greed and vanity.”
