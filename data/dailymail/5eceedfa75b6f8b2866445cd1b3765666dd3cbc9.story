Facebook has been forced to take down a page which mocked Aborigines as 'drunks who sniff petrol' following widespread outrage across Australia.

The controversial page, which also accused Aborigines of 'bludging on welfare' caused a storm of protest and campaigns for its removal.

It had more than 4,000 'likes' as well as pictures of indigenous people with offensive captions.

According to the Herald Sun, one such caption said 'How do you kill 1000 flies at once? Slap me in the face.'

The page was created in Australia on June 4 and quickly attracted hundreds of angry comments. It led to other Facebook users starting online petitions calling for it to be taken down.

Initially, Facebook said it had no plans to take action and remove the webpage.

But following a storm of protests - with Federal Communications Minister Stephen Conroy even weighing into the debate - the social media giant has now decided to remove the page.

In a statement, Facebook also said it was in discussion with the Australian Race Discrimination Commissioner.

According to the Herald Sun, Facebook 
added: 'We recognise the public concern that controversial meme Pages 
that Australians have created on Facebook have caused.

'We believe that sharing information, and the openness that results, invites conversation, debate and greater understanding.

'At the same time, we recognise that some content that is shared may be controversial, offensive, or even illegal in some countries.'

Australia's race discrimination commissioner Helen Szoke said the page could breach the country's anti-discrimination laws.

One Aboriginal elder from the Wurundjeri tribe said he was offended by some of the anonymous posts on the page.

Ian Hunter said he was not opposed to Aboriginal humour but disliked anonymous comments from people who did not state facts about who they are and why they are making the comments.
