This was Manchester derby ‘lite’. The derby that never really felt like one or sounded like one and, ultimately, was robbed of any significance or real context by the actions of one player.

Maybe it was nerves, a sense of neither club knowing where they stood before kick-off.

Maybe football is just becoming more gentrified with each passing season. Whatever the case, there was never any fizz about this occasion. Both clubs — both sets of supporters — seemed rather anxious to get it over with and move on.

Referee Michael Oliver had no choice but to give Smalling his marching orders following the tackle

Then, when it started, Chris Smalling ruined it. A senseless sending off for two pieces of brainless football.

The first offence was always going to have one outcome. The second, a tackle so late the TV cameras did well to catch it, was particularly reckless given what had already happened.

‘It wasn’t very smart,’ said Louis van Gaal. The Manchester United manager added that Smalling had apologised. His face suggested the apology had not necessarily been accepted.

Smalling’s red card certainly robbed his team. They had some momentum prior to that moment. They had started brightly, seeking to exploit some hesitancy in a strangely lifeless Manchester City.

In the wider context, though, Smalling’s dismissal left the occasion and the game distorted. You can never learn much from a 10 versus 11 contest and so it was here.

The happiest coach in the land may well be Chelsea’s Jose Mourinho. His team are now 13 points ahead of United so we can presume the Barclays Premier League title challenge for Van Gaal’s side is now over — if it ever existed. Chelsea are as unlikely to lose five times between now and next May as United are to win every game.

There were no players from Manchester in either side’s starting XI, but five from Argentina — Aguero, Zabaleta, Demichelis, Rojo and Di Maria. 

Mourinho will also have sensed ongoing issues among Sunday’s victors. City were only truly effective for half an hour.

Certainly they should have had penalties and David de Gea made a couple of very good saves when the teams were numerically equal.

In the wake of an excellent Sergio Aguero goal, however, they lost their way.

Aimless, unintelligent football returned and if they were not exactly hanging on at the full-time, they were certainly happy to hear Michael Oliver’s whistle.

As United pressed late on, Wayne Rooney may have scored — choosing to cut inside instead of shooting — Joe Hart made a super save from Angel di Maria and Marouane Fellaini somehow managed to connect only with his shoulder when escaping from Vincent Kompany at a set piece right in front of goal.

Had any of those incidents led to a goal, City manager Manuel Pellegrini would have been thinking introspectively yet again on Monday morning.

The line his team is walking between good and bad is very fine at the moment and it will be interesting to see if they can find the performance they need at home to CSKA Moscow in the Champions League on Wednesday.

From a statistical point of view, there are some numbers to trouble United. This was the fourth time on the spin City have beaten them — the last time that happened was in 1970 — while their own league tally of 13 points represents their worst start to a domestic season since 1986.

Neither of these stats really seemed to fit the mood at full-time on Sunday, though. If you are of a red persuasion you may not feel quite that glum.

United do have issues. Players continue to get injured, on the training pitch and in combat, while Robin van Persie continues to look like somebody who has just walked on to the set of Stars in Their Eyes. For the moment at least, meanwhile, the previously excellent Di Maria looks in need of some direction and a more easily identifiable role in Van Gaal’s formation.

There is a feeling, though, that Van Gaal does have United stuttering along gently in the right direction.

As he said on Sunday, they continue to have problems with retaining the ball but the calamity football of early season does seem a little distant now.

The return of their captain helped. Rooney was excellent in a withdrawn position and one wonders how long it will be before Van Gaal decides to choose Radamel Falcao ahead of him rather than Van Persie.

United may yet benefit from not playing European football. Van Gaal clearly needs time on the training field and he perhaps will not mind too much the lack of clutter on the schedule.

City do not have that luxury and, it has to be said, they do look a little leggy. Maybe this result will nudge them into gear again and certainly their celebrations at the end were indicative of relief.

This will not be a derby that lives long in the memory. Unanswered questions hang heavy for blue and for red.
