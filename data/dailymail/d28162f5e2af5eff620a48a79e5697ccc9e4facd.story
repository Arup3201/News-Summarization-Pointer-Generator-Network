An angry mother has criticised the NHS after she was told that her four-year-old could face obesity problems despite him having serious dietary issues.

Kirsty Shedlock’s son Jack has been in and out of hospital since birth with swollen bowels, causing his weight to fluctuate.

The Chadderton boy, who goes to St Luke’s Primary School, has to follow a strict diet to control the problem.

Kirsty, 26, was shocked when she was told the news after Jack was weighed and measured as part of a scheme with Oldham Community Health Service.

She said: ‘The first thing I knew was when I received a letter saying he was overweight and was more likely to be obese when he grew up.

‘I wouldn’t mind if he was eating loads of rubbish but he is on a strict diet because of his health problems.

‘I’ve asked them to take him off their database but they have refused. I’m appalled, it’s disgusting. It’s my little boy who’s suffering.’

Marie Forshaw, Oldham Community Health Service director at Pennine Care NHS Foundation Trust, said: ‘Children are routinely weighed and measured but all parents are given the opportunity to opt out if they wish.

‘We apologise for any distress caused.’

Kirsty said: ‘They said you had to sign the letter if you didn’t want it to happen, but it should be the other way around. It’s quite sneaky I think.’

Ian Walsh, the headmaster at St Luke’s, said that the letters were written by the health authority and merely handed out by the school.
