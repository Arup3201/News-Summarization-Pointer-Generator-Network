A lawyer defending a woman who was caught drink-driving while her small child was at home alone has accused Madeleine McCann's parents of child neglect.

In what has been described as an 'outrageous' slur on the missing girl's parents, defence lawyer Gareth Morgan compared them unfavourably to his client, who left her five-year-old son at home by himself before being arrested after she crashed her car at traffic lights.

He told magistrates at Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales: 'The parents of Madeleine McCann were guilty of child neglect for leaving their little girl much longer than my client. They were never prosecuted.'

The lawyer said that his client, whose son has Asperger's, was ashamed of what she had done. The 44-year-old defendant, who cannot be named, hit the back of another car at traffic lights.Â 

When police followed her home, she told them they couldn't arrest her because her son was by himself in the house, and they found the child asleep under a blanket on the sofa.

The court heard that the woman was more than two-and-a-half times over the limit when she drove to a cashpoint machine just before midnight. On her way home, she ran into a car driven by Bronnie-May Dunn, 21, which was stopped at traffic lights.

Miss Dunn suffered head injuries in the crash but magistrates heard that the driver shouted at her, saying it was her fault.

The woman admitted child neglect, drink-driving and leaving an accident and was given a 12-month supervision order, 120 hours of unpaid work, a 22-month driving ban and told to attend a course.

Today a friend of the McCanns, whose daughter went missing in Portugal in May 2007 while they ate in a nearby restaurant with friends, hit out at Mr Morgan's comments.

The friend told the Mirror: 'If Kate and Gerry were guilty of child neglect, and they were absolutely not, they would have been dealt with.

'As it is, there are two police inquiries in two different countries trying to find out what happened to Madeleine, and comments made by a lawyer in an unrelated case is offensive, outrageous and inaccurate.'

It was revealed today that Portuguese police are under mounting pressure to give British detectives access to the three 'prime suspects' wanted for questioning over the abduction of Madeleine McCann.

The Crown Prosecution Service has sent them a second 'International Letter of Request' after identifying three burglars who were operating in the Algarve resort where the McCanns were staying.

Analysis of mobile phone records at the time show that they made a high number of calls at around the time the small girl was taken.

It is now known that between January and May 2007 there had been a four-fold increase in the number of burglaries in the area around the Praia da Luz resort where the family from Rothley, Leicestershire, was staying.

Police said in October that in the 17 days before she disappeared there was one burglary and one attempted burglary in the block where the McCann family were staying.
