A 14-year-old girl has been killed by a train after she went to retrieve her cell phone which she dropped on the tracks.

Jenna Betti was hit by a Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway freight train in Martinez, California around 5pm on Sunday, police said.

According to the 14-year-old's mother Dena Derenale Betti, Jenna had reportedly been sitting on the tracks with her boyfriend and jumped off when the train approached.

However realizing that she had dropped her phone, she ran back for it but misjudged the distance of the freight train and was 'sucked in by its vacuum'.

The 14-year-old was pronounced dead when emergency services arrived at the scene. An investigation is underway today. 

Mrs Betti wrote in a Facebook post that her daughter had been sitting in the tracks with her boyfriend.

She
 wrote: 'Today my beautiful daughter kissed us goodbye. She was 
tragically killed today by a train. She was sitting on the train tracks 
with her boyfriend... Why they made such a horrible decision we'll never
 know.

'The horn blew to 
alert them. He jumped south side and she cleared north side. She dropped
 her phone and went back to retrieve it.

'She
 didn't judge the approach, and the train creates a vacuum, we were 
told, and it sucks you in. We are beyond devastated. Thank you for all 
your love, support and prayers during this very difficult time.'

Jenna has two younger sisters Julia and Gigi.

Jenna was an eighth-grader at Martinez Junior High School where her friends were wearing pink in her honor today.

Principal Jonathan Eagan told the SFGate: 'She was always laughing. If you would see her at the lunch table, sitting with her friends, she's laughing and smiling.'

He added: 'In class, she was a good student, but she also had a smile and was kind of the life of the party, in a very positive way, and she was also a phenomenal athlete.'

Mr Eagan said that he would not have been surprised if she had gone to become a professional soccer player.

Counseling was being made available at the school today.
