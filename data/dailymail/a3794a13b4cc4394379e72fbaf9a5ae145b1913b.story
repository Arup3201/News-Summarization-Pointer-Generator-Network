An Arts Council-funded theatre company has been criticised after appealing to rioters in prison to 'give their side of the story'.

The Tricycle Theatre wrote to Inside Time, the prisoners' magazine, asking for inmates to share their 'direct experiences' of the civil disorder that swept the country in August.

In the letters page of the magazine - which is read by an estimated 50,000 prisoners - Zoe Ingenhaag, associate producer of the company, says the play, called The Riots, needs convicts' input.

The 24-year-old Bristol drama graduate said: 'We would like to hear your direct experiences and opinions, and we would then hope to put them on stage, word-for-word.

'This is an opportunity to have your voice heard on a national platform, and you can choose to be anonymous if you would rather.

'Any thoughts, personal observations, views on the sentencing, or the police response, will be extremely useful to this project - we want to hear as many different views as possible.'

The Tricycle Theatre Group has a record for attacking the 'establishment' and has in the past put on plays criticising the war in Iraq, Guantanamo Bay and Bloody Sunday.

In 2007 the company produced a play called 'Called to Account - the indictment of Tony Blair for the crime of aggression against Iraq - a hearing'.

A prison source, speaking yesterday, said the request by the Tricycle Theatre Company would 'not be appreciated' by prison staff.

'For this theatre company to effectively give these people a voice is not something that we in the prison service will appreciate.

'These people made life hell for countless thousands of people across the whole of the UK and for them to be asked to give their opinions on the riots is like asking a murderer to try and explain to the family of the victim why they killed him.

'It is insensitive and basically lets these people who have looted and damaged shops, cars and people's property gain what they might see as 'respect' for what they have done.'

The Tricycle Theatre received £725,315
from the Arts Council - a non departmental public body run by the 
Department of Culture, Media and Sport - in April this year.

The
play - due to be shown at the group's 235-seat theatre in Kilburn, 
north London, from November 17 until December 10 - hopes to build a 
'real-time picture of the riots as they unfolded'.

On
the theatre company's website it states: 'The Government has so far 
refused a Public Inquiry into the riots that shook our cities this 
Summer, so the Tricycle is mounting its own.

'From tweets by taxi drivers, to moment-by-moment accounts by riot police, it will build a real-time picture of the riots as they unfolded.

'And then, from interviews with politicians, police, teachers, lawyers, community leaders, as well as victims and on-lookers, The Riots will analyse what happened, why it happened, and what we should do towards making a better future for ourselves and our city.

'Astonishing stories and equally astonishing conclusions told by the many voices that have been stirred up by the riots.'

Tickets cost £13.
