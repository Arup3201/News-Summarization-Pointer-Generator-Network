Tired of having to manually put a parasol up by yourself when the Sun starts shining?

Netherlands-based studio Toer might have the solution to your woes with their innovative parasol that inflates itself in sunny weather.

It's a product that will no doubt delight pub-goers the world over as they flood to gardens to soak up the summer.

Not a cloud in the sky (almost): The parasol inflates in about 20 seconds to a diameter of two metres

On top of the parasol is a solar panel that receives sunlight.

As the light lands upon it, it powers a fan that inflates the body of the parasol.

Made of nylon, the surface of the 'cloud' then inflates in 20 seconds to a diameter of 6.5 feet (two metres).

A silicone coating also makes it waterproof, so it won't get damaged if the sun suddenly makes way for rain.

When the sun does disappear, the parasol deflates automatically or it can be turned off automatically by a switch on the pole.

In might not go down as one of the most useful inventions of all time, but it will no doubt prove popular with those who want to stay out of the rays.

If you haven't always got a parasol to hand, American firm Netamo has you covered.

Even the most avid wearers of sunscreen have been caught out by the Sun and have got a nasty sunburn at some point.

But
 now their bracelet that observes a person’s habits and measures their sun 
exposure could help make the painful condition a thing of the past.

Connected
 to a smartphone app, the ‘June’ bracelet will send an alert to a Sun 
worshipper to tell them how to avoid becoming too exposed to skin 
damaging rays.

The
 bracelet is aimed at women who want to 
monitor their sun exposure and has a ‘jewel’ made up of UV sensors.

It
 was launched at the 2014 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas 
and will be available in the second quarter of this year in the U.S. for
 a price of $99.

It will 
connect to a smartphone app so it can tell the wearer of the bracelet 
when to apply more sunscreen and put on a hat, based on personal 
information that they have entered, such as their skin type.

‘Discover
 when and how to protect from UV rays, avoid sun damage and prevent 
premature skin ageing,’ the company says on its website.
