Vinod Khosla, 59, a billionaire technology mogul who blocked access to a popular public beach

A billionaire technology mogul is at war with surfers after blocking access to a popular public beach.

Vinod Khosla, 59, the co-founder of Sun Microsystems who now runs his own venture capitalist firm, appeared in a San Mateo County courtroom on Monday afternoon to testify in the civil dispute.

Mr Khosla is accused of closing the only road that leads to Martin's Beach in violation of the California Coastal Act.

The beach is about 35 miles south of San Francisco and is a favourite with surfers for its great waves.

It was open to the public for years for $5 access and parking

In California, unlike in many other states, all beaches are open to the public under the constitution.

But private landowners are not always required to allow access to the coastline across their properties.

Many disputes have arisen over the years, often involving wealthy beachfront homeowners.

In the case of Martin's Beach, the previous owner had allowed locals to access the beach for a fee.

But Mr Khosla, a father of three, who owns the land via limited liability 
corporations, has closed off the access road and hired guards to keep people
 out.

In court this week he said he did not remember seeing certain documents, including one from a judge saying he would need approval to close off access to the beach.

'I get 500 to 1,000 pages of documents a week. I'm not trying to be unreasonable, that is what my life is like,' Mr Khosla testified, according to KTVU-TV.

'I was dumbfounded at the lack of 
ability to explain or remember,' the plaintiff attorney Joe Cotchett 
told KTVU outside the court.

Mr Khosla bought the 89-acre Martins Beach property for $37.5 million in 2008, reports SiliconValley.com.

Two years later he closed the gate on a private road off Highway 1 leading to it - a move that incensed the Surfrider Foundation and environmentalists

Mr Khosla's attorney, Jeffrey Essner, says the public was previously allowed to access the beach for a fee, so there was never a right of public access.

According to the Surfrider Foundation because the gates were permanently locked, the usage of the land has changed - they argue that qualifies as development under state coastal law and therefore required a permit from the California Coastal Commission.

But Mr Khosla, who has been an early backer of environmentally friendly startups, says he does not need a development permit as his lawyers argue there has been no development.

But his attorneys claim he simply wants to establish that he cannot be forced to allow people on the property and he had no specific plans for the property.

Mr Khosla said that his attorneys have pursued the issue in court because he wants 'facts of law' to determine what is right, rather than 'public opinion.'

The dispute echoes record mogul David Geffen's long battle to prevent use of a walkway near his Malibu home.

In 1983, Geffen agreed to allow a pathway to Carbon Beach when he sought permits for a pool and other additions, but he later filed suit to fight the access. In 2005, Geffen settled the suit and allowed the public walkway.

Dubbed 'Billionaire's Beach,' Carbon has been home to titans such as Oracle Chief Executive Larry Ellison and movie and television stars John Travolta, Courtney Cox and David Arquette.

The tiff also evokes some other neighborly disputes in recent years involving wealthy technology executives including late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs and Ellison.

Jobs fought a bitter battle with neighbors in Woodside, California, over a 1920s-era house he owned but wanted to tear down and replace with something sleeker.

He twice won demolition permits that were contested by preservationists; the wrecking ball finally came down in 2011, months before his death. The property is now vacant.

That same year, Ellison settled a case he had filed against his neighbors over trees he said blocked views of the bay from his house in San Francisco's Pacific Heights neighborhood.

In 2012, special-effects pioneer George Lucas, the creator of Star Wars, got so fed up with his development-fighting neighbors in Marin County, California, that he scrapped plans to expand his Skywalker Ranch and said he would instead sell it to a developer to build low-income housing.
