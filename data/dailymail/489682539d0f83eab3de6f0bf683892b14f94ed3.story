A rare collection of cartoons which attempted to boost the morale of troops in the First World War have emerged for sale 100 years after the fighting broke out.

The humorous sketches sympathised with low-ranking soldiers while teasing the British high command, and became a hit with soldiers on the front line as well as those back home.

They were the handiwork of Bruce Bairnsfather, a soldier who had been hospitalised during the Second Battle of Ypres in Belgium in 1915.

Morale: A rare collection of cartoons to boost the morale of First World War troops have emerged for sale. They send up the shock many soldiers received at the rise of mechanised warfare, with a sword reduced to a toasting fork (left) and a grenade-juggling soldier who causes 'considerable anxiety to his platoon' (right)

Popular: The cartoons had a heavy influence on public life. They dealt with queries about raspberry jam (left) and made light of the dreadful conditions in the trenches

While recovering from shellshock and hearing loss at the headquarters of the 34th Division on Salisbury Plain, he invented a curmudgeonly British private called Old Bill, who sported a trademark walrus moustache and balaclava.

Mr Bairnsfather expanded on the character and soon his light-hearted cartoons rose to prominence after they were published in The Bystander magazine.

The cartoonist went on to produce several special editions including Bullets and Billets and Fragments from France, which typically featured Old Bill in a host of less-than-ideal situations.

In one, called The New Submarine Danger, he and another soldier are stood in the trenches with water up to their chests when Old Bill's colleague says: 'They’ll be torpedoin’ us if we stick ‘ere much longer, Bill.'

Another sketch from 1918 shows Old Bill sitting on the Kaiser’s throne. The caption simply reads: 'Ullo!'

After the war Mr Bairnsfather 
continued drawing Old Bill, who has been cited as one of more than a 
dozen possible origins of the nickname for police.

One of Mr Bairnsfather's favourite characters was Old Bill, pictured exhausted and sitting on the Kaiser's throne (left). The cartoons poked gentle fun at soldiers having to improvise, with one dressing as a tree (right). Mr Bairnsfather created his characters while recovering from shellshock sustained in the Second Battle of Ypres

Humour: One cartoon reworked the phrase 'this bloody war' and used it to describe conditions on the front line, where soldiers remained through freezing, soggy winters

Grim: The cartoons tapped into a well of humour that was sometimes incredibly dark, with soldiers facing the constant threat of death from above or below

In the Second World War he was the official cartoonist of the American forces in Europe, creating sketches from his home in Shropshire, and he continued drawing until his death from bladder cancer in 1959.

Now a rare, limited first edition of Bullets and Billets signed by Bairnsfather is tipped to fetch £400, with the complete Fragments from France set expected to sell for £150, during an auction next Wednesday in Blandford, Dorset.

The are being sold by a collector of First World War memorabilia from Dorset.

Patrick Bogue, from auctioneers Onslows, said: 'Humour was an incredibly important part of the First World War. In the army it was generally aimed at generals and high ranking officers and helped boost morale.

'Cartoons began appearing in The Bystander magazine by Bruce Bairnsfather, who had been hospitalised with shell shock in 1915.

'Bairnsfather had been posted to a 
division headquarters on Salisbury Plain where he started drawing funny 
cartoons about life in the trenches for The Bystander.

Huge moustache: Facial hair was the height of fashion (and compulsory for officers) during the First World War, but clearly it prompted sniggering from some quarters

Rare: The cartoons were collected into several special editions during the war called Fragments from France, which proved a hit with those at home and abroad

Death is but a moment away: The cartoons were created by Bruce Bairnsfather (left), who knew first-hand the horrors of battle after fighting in Belgium in 1915

'His cartoons revolved around the character of Old Bill, a typical squaddie with a pipe and a walrus moustache. They were incredibly popular with soldiers who would eagerly await the next volume.

'They were so successful in cheering up troops that Bairnsfather was appointed by the War Office to draw similar cartoons for other forces.

'These original cartoons are very rare indeed.'
