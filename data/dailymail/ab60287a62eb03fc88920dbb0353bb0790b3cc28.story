A football striker 'panicked' after receiving topless selfie pictures of his club's middle-aged administrator because she was as old as his mother, a tribunal heard.

The 23-year-old striker for Burton Albion exchanged saucy snaps with Kerry Miller, 46, who is accusing the League Two team of driving her out of her job. 

Billie Kee told an employment tribunal how he sent naked pictures of himself to the blonde after receiving an image of her wearing underwear and another completely topless.

Yesterday Burton manager Gary Rowett, 
39, said he was forced to speak to Mr Kee about the matter following 
complaints she had barged into the dressing rooms while players were 
getting changed.

Giving evidence on the fourth day of the tribunal in Leicester, he said: 'I asked Billy if he had received a text from Kerry.

'He said he had received a picture of her in her underwear and another of her topless.

'He actually said he panicked and said "she’s’the same age as my mum".'

The
 tribunal heard how Ms Miller entered the players’ area on 15 occasions 
and also confessed to have a 'casual' relationship with defender Ryan 
Austin, 29, who has since left the club.

Mr Rowett - who played in 
the Premier League for Everton and Leicester City - told the hearing he 
always believed there was a 'sexual connotation' to her actions.

He 
said he was forced to go to chairman Ben Robinson after a senior player 
complained that her constantly being in the dressing room was making him
 feel uncomfortable.

The former defender added: 'I received a complaint from Zander Diamond. He came to my office and asked to speak to me.

'He
 actually said he didn’t feel comfortable and didn’t feel it was right 
and it hadn’t happened at any club he had been at in the past.

'I was aware of Kerry being in and around the dressing room area. I was aware of her up serving food.

'I
 then made the chairman aware of it and then went and told Fleur 
(Robinson) exactly what the complaint was and what my thoughts were on 
the situation.

'I just had the general feeling that she wanted to be 
around the players more than was necessary for someone who wasn’t a 
member of the playing staff.

'I thought there was very much a sexual 
connotation to her actions because for me there would be no other reason
 for her to be in the situation she was in.

'One time she came down 
to our office after a game, knocked on the door and sat in the middle of
 the office for five minutes without particularly being invited.'To be honest I felt uncomfortable.

'Maybe it was me being a married man.'

The
 manager, who took over at the club in 2009, also said he had never come
 across a similar issue with a female member of staff throughout his 
entire football career.

He added: 'I’ve never come across a situation where a woman has been around where the players are.

'It was like a beacon going ‘this is not normal.

'In 24 years of being a footballer, coach and manager - I’ve never seen a woman in the dressing room.

'As a male I would never walk into a female dressing room.'

Ms
 Miller quit her sales role at the club’s Pirelli Stadium in 
Burton-upon-Trent, Staffs, in February last year after a row with the 
chairman.

On the third day of her employment tribunal today, the 
hearing heard of allegations of rumours she had been seeing 28-year-old 
goalkeeper Stuart Tomlinson between September and Christmas 2012.

The
 following year Tomlinson turned his back on football after suffering a 
bad knee injury to pursue a career in WWE wrestling in America.

Giving evidence the club’s chairman Ben Robinson said Mr Tomlinson was a part-time male escort while he played for the team.

Burton
 Albion’s club secretary and commercial director Fleur Robinson said she
 had spoken to Ms Miller after she posted an image of the pair together 
in a Chester night-club.

Giving evidence Ms Robinson, who is also 
the chairman’s daughter, admitted she had 'raised an eyebrow' when the 
picture emerged on October 27, 2012 - just hours after a crucial game.

Veteran
 defender Aaron Webster, 32, told the hearing Ms Miller would be 
constantly around the players on a daily basis and at one time was 'all 
over' the club chairman.

Giving evidence, Mr Webster - who made 
589 appearances and scored 101 goals for the club in 16 years before he 
left last summer - said: 'Kerry likes male attention.

In my opinion she 
would flirt very directly with male staff and players on a regular and 
daily basis.

'She came around the dressing room and the physio room in the morning. During lunchtime she would be around the players.

The
 tribunal today heard how Ms Miller was a 'desperate' flirt who thrived 
on male attention and was viewed as a threat by Burton Albion's WAGs

'At one period we did see her quite frequently. I'm not 100 per cent sure why she would be there.

'Some of the girlfriends saw Kerry as a bit of a threat. She was all over the chairman on one occasion.

'If
 I'm honest I felt it was a little bit desperate from her at times. 
According to me I think she liked the male attention so if there was any
 whistles or noises from the players she would like it.

'That's 
why I personally think we saw her on a daily basis. I thought she 
thrived on that. I've seen pictures on two players phones - Ryan Austin 
and Billy Kee.

'I heard she had a thing for him [Stuart Tomlinson] but I never heard a rumour they had slept together.'

The widow, from Marchington, Staffs, is claiming constructive dismissal, sexual discrimination and harassment against the club.

Burton Albion deny all the allegations.

The employment tribunal panel has now retired to consider their verdict and are expected to announce their decision tomorrow.

In
 a closing statement Sarah George, representing Burton Albion FC, said 
Ms Miller had 'overreacted' to being reprimanded for her behaviour.

She said: 'This is a professional football club.

'The
 two occasions that she was spoken to were when a justifiable complaint 
had been made about her coming in to the dressing room regularly when 
the players were in a state of undress.

'The actions taken by the club were simply to tell the claimant to go about her business.

'The
 reason for doing so was not because of assumptions made about the 
claimant because she was a woman but based upon what she had done and 
the desire to ensure that employees were working in the area they should
 be working in.

'Her employment was not under threat, there’s no suggestion that was the case.

'The complainant has overreacted.'

Representing
 Ms Miller, James Bruce said his client was left with no faith in the 
organisation and felt excluded by chairman Ben Robinson.

He said: 'Mr Robinson handed out at least two reprimands to the claimant.

'The force of that reprimand is a matter of dispute but I suggest it was said in anger.

'He certainly was annoyed, Mr Robinson admits that himself, and I suggest that anger would have shown itself.

'The latter of those reprimands included the warning to stay away from the players.

'And that I suggest is a restriction of Ms Miller’s movement in her own workplace.

'The initial comment itself was the order not to cook for the players.

'The club prides itself on being a closely-knit family business.

'Members of the staff are expected to muck in, to help out.

'I
 suggest for a member of staff to not be able to do that would be 
detrimental because it leads to a sense of exclusion within one’s own 
team.

'Ms Miller had in the past complained to Mr Robinson about how he spoke to her and how he treated her.

'Ms
 Miller is left with no faith her concerns are being listened to when 
she is subjected to that treatment off the cuff by the man in charge of 
that organisation.'
