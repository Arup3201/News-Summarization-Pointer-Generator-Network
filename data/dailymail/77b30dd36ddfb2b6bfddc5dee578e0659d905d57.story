Guilty plea: Michelle Roberts, 45, stole bank cards, vouchers and cash from her 'vulnerable' relatives at a wake

A thief broke down into tears in court as she admitted stealing cash, bank cards and vouchers from relatives at her uncle's wake.

Michelle Roberts, 45, admitted four counts of theft and three counts of fraud at Basildon Crown Court, Essex, on Monday.

Roberts began crying and shaking in the dock as she admitted taking four bank cards, £300 in John Lewis vouchers, a cheque book and £80 in cash from 'vulnerable' family members at the wake in Shoebury, Essex.

The day after the wake on December 
19, 2011, Roberts used the bank cards to order CDs and DVDs on Cdwow.com
 and had the parcels delivered to her home address in Gravesend, Kent.

She
 also ordered £270 worth of goods from Asda online, which included two 
mobile phones and an iPod dock, which was discovered by police at her 
Ascot Road home in Gravesend.

The
 court heard that when Roberts was arrested she blamed the thefts on her
 partner, who was found later to have nothing to do with the crime.

In a lengthy police interview after her arrest in April 2012 she also admitted to spending the John Lewis vouchers.

Tony Abelle, prosecuting, told the court that Roberts hadn’t seen some of her family for 25 years before attending the service.

He said: 'She was seen by a family member hunched over a handbag in the living room, rifling through it.

'The lady didn’t think anything of it till later when she discovered her bag open, her car keys on the window sill and her son’s library card hidden behind a cushion.

'The defendant was also seen trying to distract people by telling them to look at old photos so they would come away from their handbags.'

Roberts was also heard asking for people’s addresses and dates of birth.

Members
 of the family became suspicious about her behaviour and in the 
following days discovered items were missing. It was established four 
women had bank cards taken. 

In court: Roberts pleaded guilty at Basildon Crown Court and was released on unconditional bail until her sentencing in March

Steven Fitzpatrick, mitigating, told the court Roberts had mental health issues and had been in an abusive relationship.

The court heard that in 2012 she stole from charity boxes in north Kent while pretending her teenage son had terminal cancer.

Roberts also admitted to stealing a purse from an 89-year-old lady while carrying out community payback at the Northfleet Sunday Lunch Club for the elderly.

She was locked up for 180 days after a suspended sentence she received in July 2012 was activated.

Roberts, who attended court with two of her sons and former partner, was released on unconditional bail until her sentencing in March.

A family member, who is in her 80s and did not want to be named, said outside court: 'It has been two years of hell and I am glad she pleaded guilty and it is finally over.'

Another family member who wished to remain anonymous said he believed she only came to the wake with the intention of stealing from attendees.

Judge Jonathon Black told Roberts: 'You should prepare yourself for a custodial sentence the next time you come back here.'
