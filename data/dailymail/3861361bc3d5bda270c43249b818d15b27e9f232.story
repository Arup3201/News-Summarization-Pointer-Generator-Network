In what could be considered the ultimate in wearable technology, a biohacker has inserted a computer under his skin.

The biometric sensor is fitted into German-based Tim Cannon’s forearm - between his skin and tissue - and tracks changes in his body’s temperature.

This sensor can connect wirelessly to any Android device, produce readouts of the temperature changes and send Cannon a text message if he’s suffering from a fever, for example.

German-based biohacker Tim Cannon fitted the biometric sensor, pictured, under the skin on his forearm. It connects by Bluetooth to an Android tablet. The sensor tracks changes in his body's temperature. If the temperature reaches a certain level, a text message is sent warning him of a fever

To insert the device, an incision was made on Cannon's forearm above an existing tattoo.

His skin was lifted and separated away
 from his tissue and the device was inserted into the pocket that is 
created before being sutured shut.

The sensor can connect wirelessly over Bluetooth to 
any Android device, produce readouts of the temperature changes, and 
send Cannon a text message if he’s suffering from a fever, for example.

Circadia is protected inside a protective case and has a battery that can be charged wirelessly.

Cannon created the sensor, called Circadia 1.0, using a Bluetooth connector, computer chip, and fitted it with LED lights.

These LEDs act as ‘status lights’ that can be used to light up a tattoo on Cannon’s arm, under which the sensor is fitted.

The first version of the sensor reads temperature changes but, in theory, later versions could be used to track other vital signs and body changes.

Circadia is protected inside a protective case and has a battery that can be charged wirelessly.

‘The human body is really failing in almost every way,’ Cannon told Motherboard, VICE’s science and technology channel.

‘I want to live to be thousands of years old, I don't want to die and I don't know why anybody would.

‘[The idea behind the sensor] is very fun. It's meant to capture people's imagination.'

Cannon created the sensor, called Circadia 1.0, pictured, using a Bluetooth connector, computer chip, and fitted it with LED lights. The sensor is set to go on sale 'soon' for around $500 (£313) and is open source, meaning the data can be collected and used in whichever way the owner wants

Cannon is a biohacker working for a company called Grindhouse Wetware that builds devices designed to integrate with the human body.

Cannon added: ‘We basically focus on the merging of man and machine.’

To insert the device, an incision was made on Cannon's forearm above an existing tattoo.

His skin was lifted and separated away from his tissue and the device was inserted into the pocket that was created before being sutured shut.

It was inserted by a so-called Flesh Engineer called Steve Haworth at the Body Modification Conference in Germany.

To insert the device, pictured, an incision was made on Cannon's forearm above an existing tattoo. His skin was lifted and separated away from his tissue and the device was inserted into the pocket that was created, before being sutured shut. LEDs fitted to the sensor act as 'status lights' to show the device is working

Cannon told Motherboard that no doctor would carry out the procedure, and Haworth did not use any anaesthetic.

Before the procedure, Haworth told Motherboard: 'When we put this in it will make history.'

The Circadia 1.0 is set to go on sale ‘soon’ for around $500 (£313) and is open source, meaning that the data can be collected and used in whichever way the owner wants.

This does not include fitting, which Haworth said he would charge around $200 (£125).
