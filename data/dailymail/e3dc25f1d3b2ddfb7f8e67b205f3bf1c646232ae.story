Staff at key industrial plants are having to sit in the cold doing nothing as firms shut off power to avoid crippling energy bills.

Heavy industries such as steel manufacturing face a complex price-setting regime which means, for example, that boiling a kettle during periods of peak demand can cost up to £27.

Some are now trying to protect themselves by shutting down during high-demand winter periods.

Industry leaders say this ‘Third World’ scenario is damaging the economy. The details emerged amid growing concern of an energy gap caused by the switch from coal-fired power stations to green energy, in particular wind farms, which means Britain could face an electricity shortage by the winter of 2015-16. Tony Pedder, chairman of heavy steel engineering firm Sheffield Forgemasters, said he expects the plant to shut down around 30 times over the winter.

‘It costs us £27 to boil the kettle,’ he said. ‘We end up telling our workers to sit in the mess room to keep warm because we can’t afford to keep going. It is a crazy system and it is getting worse.’

The unusual measures are the result of a ‘triad’ price-setting regime unique to UK energy supply.

A portion of the charge paid by industry for its electricity goes to the National Grid to maintain and improve cable networks.

The figure is based on how much electricity the 100,000 heaviest users consume during three undisclosed half-hour periods of peak demand between November and February, called triads.

Consequently firms try to avoid these periods, when the price of electricity spikes upwards by as much as 300 times.

Celsa Steel (UK) in Cardiff has shut down daily this winter for up to three hours at peak times.

And Tata Steel said a specialist division in Yorkshire shut down between 4pm and 6pm every day last week. The firm was hit with a  £1million bill after operating during a half-hour peak period.

High UK energy bills, partly driven up by tariffs imposed to fund a shift to green energy, are a handicap to the economy.

The chemical arm of Tata, which is Indian-owned, closed a soda ash plant in Cheshire last year in favour of importing from the US, while BASF of Germany is shutting a pigment plant in Paisley next year.

In December energy industry regulator Ofgem announced measures to head off the threat of blackouts in 2015. Firms will be paid to cease production on winter evenings.

Director of the Energy Intensive Users Group, Jeremy Nicholson, said: ‘How are we supposed to expect investment to continue into this country if we are in danger of moving toward having Third World levels of reliability for power?’

National Grid said all charges and the triad system were agreed with customers.

A spokesman said: ‘Large business users are incentivised to reduce their usage at times of peak demand.

‘This has the effect of reducing overall peak demand, so less investment is needed to upgrade transmission networks to deal with peaks in demand. It also smoothes out the peaks in demand so that power stations can be operated more efficiently.’

He also challenged the suggestion it would cost £27 to boil the kettle during a triad, saying the figure was an average of £1.46.
