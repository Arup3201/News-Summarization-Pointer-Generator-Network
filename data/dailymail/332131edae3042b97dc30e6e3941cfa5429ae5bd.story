Sixteen and 17-year-olds will be allowed to vote within a year of the next election, Labour leader Ed Miliband pledged last night.

Mr Miliband said the government would change the law to lower the voting age from May 2016.

Such a move – the first change in the national voting age since 1969 – would enfranchise more than 1.5million 16 and 17-year-olds. It comes after the voting age was lowered for the first time in the Scottish referendum in September.

Giving teenagers the vote was tested during the Scottish independence referendum in September 

During a YouTube debate, organised by the 'Bite The Ballot' youth democracy movement, Mr Miliband said: ‘Too many young people are turning their backs on politics which is bad for our country and bad for them too.

‘That’s because too often young people don’t get a look-in with politicians who know they can’t vote - or assume that they won’t vote.

‘The measures we will introduce in our first year of government represent the greatest extension of the franchise in my lifetime.

‘But it is not enough just to give young people the right to vote. We must do everything we can to ensure they have the chance to exercise it.'

Mr Miliband, who has long been a supporter of an earlier voting age, is expected to use a speech at next week’s party conference to pledge that the policy will be included in his general election manifesto.

Party sources believe that idealistic youngsters are more likely to vote Labour. The idea is also backed by the Liberal Democrats. 

The voting age in Britain was reduced from 21 to 18 in 1969.

Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps has previously dismissed calls to lower the voting age to 16 when the issue was raised last year.

Mr Shapps warned the move would ‘politicise the classroom, with votes for youngsters who are still at school’.

He also accused Labour of bowing to the demands of its union paymasters over the issue.

Last year Unite, which is Labour’s biggest donor, demanded that 16-year-olds should be given the vote. 

The union, run by Len McCluskey, said: ‘Young people should be given a stake in the political process by lowering the voting age to 16.’

An exit poll of just over 2,000 Scottish voters by Tory peer Lord Ashcroft showed that the 16 and 17-year-olds enfranchised for the first time by the Scottish referendum were overwhelmingly in favour of independence.

The small sample – which may not have been representative of teenagers overall – showed that 71 per cent of the age group voted Yes. In contrast, only 27 per cent of over-65s voted in favour of independence in Lord Ashcroft’s sample.

The figures suggest that school pupils are indeed more likely to vote for radical options placed in front of them.

But this did not carry through to the next age group – the split between Yes and No for 18- to 24-year-olds was virtually even in the exit poll.
