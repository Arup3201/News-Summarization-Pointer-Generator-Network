The largest fleet of Tall Ships to have visited London in 25 years - some more than a century old - sailed into Greenwich yesterday for the start of a four-day festival on the River Thames.

With their towering sails billowing in the wind, more than 50 vessels, including 11 magnificent square-sail ships, descended on the south east corner of the capital for the Royal Greenwich Tall Ships Regatta. 

Hundreds of thousands of spectators are expected to turn out to watch the vessels sail past famous landmarks such as Canary Wharf, the 02, the Thames Cable car and the Royal Docks. It is London's first regatta for 25 years and the first time a Tall Ships race has both started and finished in a UK port.

Imposing ships have come from around the globe to take part the event, including from Spain, Holland, Portugal, Poland and Russia.

The participating vessels include Tenacious, the largest wooden tall ship of her kind which has been sailed by a crew with physical disabilities from the Jubilee Sailing Trust.

Other boats in the race included the Shtandart, a modern replica of a Russian navy flagship built for Peter the Great in 1703, and the Tecla, which is almost 100 years old.   

The Tall Ships Festival is set over four sites in Woolwich, Maritime Greenwich, Greenwich Peninsula and Canary Wharf and will line the river's banks until Tuesday, before the grand parade down the river.

The event began in Falmouth and saw the ships race from the Cornish Port to the Isle of Wight, before cruising to the capital.  The parade sets off from Royal Greenwich, opposite Canary Wharf, on Tuesday.
