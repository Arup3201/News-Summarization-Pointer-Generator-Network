Double director: Ex-chief constable Martin Baker runs two consultancy companies which stands to profit from the commissioner elections

A former chief constable could make thousands of pounds from the taxpayer as a result of this month’s police elections.

Martin Baker suddenly resigned from his £141,000-a-year job as chief constable of Dorset Police, saying he felt ‘the time was right to hand over leadership’.

But only five days after leaving the force, he became a director of two consultancy companies that offer services to the new police and crime commissioners.

The candidates standing for the commissioner positions in 41 forces in England and Wales on November 15 are mainly made up of local politicians with little law enforcement experience.

This has left an opportunity for former senior policemen to give them advice and administrative help when they are appointed, at a huge potential cost to the taxpayer.

Mr Baker, 56, registered as a director of both One Team Policing and One Team Advisory on October 5. The name is similar to the motto he helped choose for Dorset Police: ‘One Team, One Vision.’

He officially finished his job with Dorset Police on September 30. Last year he received a bonus of £13,000, and he is entitled to a pension worth two thirds of his final salary or around £90,000 a year.

The website for both companies state that its professionals provide specialist advice on ‘all aspects of law enforcement, criminal justice and community safety’.

Mr Baker joined One Team Policing with two of his former colleagues from Dorset Police. It was set up by former assistant chief constable Mike Glanville and former chief superintendent Gill Donnell in March.

Miss Donnell lives with Dorset Police’s director of human resources Graham Smith. Mr Baker and Mr Glanville are the only directors of One Team Advisory, which offers similar services.

Under the banner ‘Voice of the people’, One Team Policing’s website states: ‘We are offering prospective candidates a range of free to use and paid services to support them in advance of the elections including a range of on-line campaign services.

‘We will also be able to provide a range of specialist services to elected commissioners once they take up office.’

As it is a new company, the amount of money it has received has not yet been recorded publicly.

But it has been reported that the company has offered commissioner candidates a ‘Standard Web Presence’ for £359 and a ‘Premium Web Presence’ for £1,799.

Among the advice it offers are tips on ‘strategic leadership’, ‘cost reduction’ and ‘working with the media’.

Police and crime commissioners will not run forces directly but will be responsible for appointing their chief constable, setting out local policing priorities, reporting annually on progress, and setting out the force budget.

They will be paid between £65,000 to £100,000-a-year and candidates mainly include local politicians rather than the Government’s hope of former police chiefs.

Patrick Mercer, chairman of the parliamentary sub-committee on counter-terrorism, said: ‘Unfortunately the money that the police authorities have to disperse will make these consultancy roles increasingly attractive to senior officers who are keen to retire and enter private business.’

Miss Donnell said: ‘We are delighted that Martin Baker has been able to join us at One Team Policing. His extensive experience in policing will be a real asset to our customers.’
