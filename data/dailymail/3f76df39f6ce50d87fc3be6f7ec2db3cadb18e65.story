Too cool for school: Victor Micula was kicked out of his exam after being caught cheating

The teenage son of a £160million tycoon learned the hard way that money can't buy everything - when he was booted out of his high school final exams for cheating.

Victor Micula, 18, who used to arrive at school by helicopter so he could sleep in longer in the mornings, turned up for the exam resit in a black £160,000 Ferrari, boasting to local reporters in Oradea, western Romania, that he was 'confident and well prepared'.

The Ferrari was then driven off by a minder, but just an hour later a scowling Victor emerged - and he dashed into a waiting Mercedes S class limo, refusing to say a word.

The reason for his fury emerged days later when the results of the test posted on the school noticeboard revealed he had been removed from the exam for cheating.

One schoolmate said: 'This was his last chance to graduate because he'd already failed the exam once.

'It just shows you money can't buy everything - but I don't think it's going to affect his career prospects as he can always get a job from his dad.'

Under Romanian education ministry rules, a dismissal for cheating means the boy will not be allowed to take the final exam again before 2016.

The  teen stands to inherit a fortune from his father Ioan Micula, who built his business empire in tourism, property, the media and industry.

Victor's antics are a regular feature in the Romanian media.

Victor's antics are often reported on in the Romanian media - and often involve his driving

He was rapped when he drove his Ferrari down a pedestrian-only street to go shopping at a jewellery shop with his girlfriend, and was banned from driving for three months when he was caught speeding.

Earlier this year, he told reporters he wanted to go to a Romanian monastery to pray and find peace from exam pressure - but angered those meditating at the building by turning up in his private helicopter.

Victor's older sister Olivia, who studied at Regent's Business School, got married earlier this month The bride and groom released around 500 white doves during the ceremony, while at the reception guests sat around a two metre high wedding cake.
