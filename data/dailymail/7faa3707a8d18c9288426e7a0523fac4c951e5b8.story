Sky TV boss James Murdoch is being lined up to take direct responsibility for New Corp's U.S. television businesses, it has emerged.

The news that News Corp is looking to expand Mr Murdoch's role was revealed on the day he was censured by the media watchdog for his 'ill-judged' handling of the phone-hacking crisis.

His role will be expanded to include responsibility for the Fox Networks Group following publication of the Ofcom report.

James Murdoch's conduct as chairman of BSkyB was today described as 'ill-judged' by Ofcom

Mr Murdoch was heavily criticised in the report, with his record in the UK attacked by media regulator Ofcom.

Sky was cleared to continue airing 
programmes, as Ofcom today said BSkyb remained a ‘fit and proper’ 
broadcaster despite the phone-hacking scandal.

It found no evidence that Sky was directly or indirectly involved in any of the wrongdoing either admitted or alleged.

BSkyB has been cleared as a 'fit and proper' broadcaster despite its parent company being embroiled in the phone hacking scandal

Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation owns a 39 per cent stake in BSkyB.

News Corp had hoped to buy the rest of BSkyB but was forced to drop its bid as the phone hacking scandal erupted.

The review was launched last year 
after News International, also owned by News Corp, was forced to close 
the News of the World after a wave of allegations of phone hacking at 
the Sunday tabloid newspaper.

James Murdoch was chief executive of News International and chairman of BSkyB when the scandal erupted.

He remains a non-executive director at Sky and an executive director at News Corp.

Ofcom said his failure to get to the bottom of the allegations sooner was ‘difficult to comprehend and ill-judged'.

But it said there was no evidence that James Murdoch knew of widespread wrongdoing or that he was complicit in a cover-up.

Sky welcomed the licence decision today, insisting it was ‘committed to high standards of governance’.

‘As Ofcom acknowledges, our track record of compliance in broadcasting is good,’ the firm said in a statement.

But Ofcom was critical of James Murdoch’s failure to act.

It said: ‘We consider James Murdoch’s conduct, including his failure to initiate action on his own account on a number of occasions, to be both difficult to comprehend and ill-judged.'

He was not involved with News International until the end of 2007, 
almost a year after the sentencing of News of the World's royal editor 
Clive Goodman and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire for phone hacking.

But after he took over as chief 
executive, he received an email suggesting that criminal activities were
more widespread, although he claimed he failed to read the 
correspondence fully.

Ofcom added: 'We consider that the events set out above raise questions 
regarding James Murdoch's competence in the handling of these matters 
and his attitude towards the possibility of wrongdoing in the companies 
for which he was responsible.'

Ofcom said its duty to be satisfied that a licensee is fit and proper is ongoing.

'Should further relevant evidence become available in the future, Ofcom would need to consider that evidence in order to fulfil its duty.'

In July 2011, Ofcom announced it had a duty to investigate whether Sky was fit and proper to continue to hold its broadcast licences, in light of allegations about phone hacking.

In a statement today the regulator said: 'Ofcom considers that, on the evidence currently available and having taken into account all the relevant factors, Sky is fit and proper to hold its broadcast licences.'

Harriet Harman, Labour's shadow culture secretary, said:  'While Ofcom has found Sky is fit and proper to hold a broadcasting licence, its criticisms of James Murdoch are damning.

'His continued presence on Sky’s board casts a shadow over one of our most important national broadcasters.'

James and Rupert Murdoch give evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee last July

In March James Murdoch wrote to the Commons Culture, Media, Sport Select Committee to apologise for his conduct.

He
conceded he should have 'asked more questions, requested more documents
and taken a more challenging and sceptical view of what I was told.'

Labour MP Tom Watson, a leading critic of the Murdoch empire, said he was 'disappointed but not surprised' by Ofcom's ruling.

Mr Watson said: 'I do think it shows the flaws in Ofcom methodology. They cannot do deep investigations in the way that other organisations can.

'They also do hedge their bets, they say that the test can be applied at any time if there is new evidence, and were also critical of James Murdoch where they say his conduct wasn’t that becoming of a chairman or a chief executive. So they’re not entirely cleared by the report.'

Mr Watson also suggested there could be more revelations in the future which could reopen the question of the Murdoch empire's governance.

'I think the share arrangements of News Corporation that’s two tiered and effectively means that Rupert Murdoch and his family effectively control the entire organisation, will ultimately come back and haunt both him and James Murdoch.

'I think there’ll be more revelations in the years to come that mean that Ofcom might have to apply that fit and proper person test in the near future and they might be regretting this report today.'

News Corp welcomed Ofcom's decision but defended James Murdoch, saying he deserved credit for leading Sky to its outstanding record as a broadcaster.

It said in a statement: 'We are pleased that Ofcom recognises BSkyB as a fit and proper holder of a broadcast licence and remain proud of both News Corporation's and James Murdoch's distinguished record in facilitating the transformation of Sky into Britain's leading pay television and home communications provider.

'We disagree, however, with certain of the report's statements about James Murdoch's prior actions as an executive and director, which are not at all substantiated by evidence.'
