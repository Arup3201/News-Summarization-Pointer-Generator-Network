Chelsea have revived interest in HNK Rijeka striker Andrej Kramaric. 

The 23-year-old Croatia international has scored 28 goals in all competitions this season and his club are looking to cash in. 

Leicester offered £7.9m earlier this month but the player wants to go to a bigger club.

Tottenham, Juventus, AC Milan and Inter have all made enquiries while Atalanta were told that the player had already decided on Chelsea. 

The Premier League leaders are keen and would look to loan out Kramaric but a deal has not been agreed. 

Rijeka sports director Sreck Juricic said: 'In next days we will again meet with people from Leicester City and we will talk a little bit more.

'Our main goal is that both sides must be happy with the potential transfer: we as a club and he as a striker. So we are not only talking with Leicester City, but also to other clubs.'

Leicester have also bid £7.5m for Danny Ings at Burnley and have an interest in Rickie Lambert of Liverpool.
