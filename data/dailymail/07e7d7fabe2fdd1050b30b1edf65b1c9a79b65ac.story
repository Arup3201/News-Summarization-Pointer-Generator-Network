Snatched:  Carlesha Freeland-Gaither, a 22-year-old nurse from Philadelphia, was abducted Sunday on her way home from visiting her godson. Her bank card was used Tuesday morning in Aberdeen, Maryland 

Police have released still photos from a surveillance video shot inside a Maryland bank showing a man using an ATM card belonging to a woman who was violently abducted in Philadelphia just hours earlier.

Detectives say the grainy footage shows a black male in a dark hooded jacket withdrawing money from a PNC bank in Aberdeen, Maryland, using Carlesha Freeland-Gaither's card at 6.01am Monday.

The bank in question is located more than 70 miles southwest of the Germantown section of Philadelphia where the 22-year-old nurse was last seen fighting for her life against her assailant.

While police would not say whether the man seen using Freeland-Gaither's bank card is the same person who was captured on another surveillance video forcing her into a car Sunday, they believe he has a similar description as the kidnapper, Philadelphia Police Chief Inspector Dennis Wilson told NBC Philadelphia.

As police are working to enhance the surveillance footage of the victim's abduction, Freeland-Gaither's family have spoken out about a former boyfriend who was allegedly 'obsessed' with the young nurse. 

Freeland-Gaither grew up in Maryland, where she attended high school and lived with her grandmother. Two years ago, she moved to Philadelphia, where she has been working with cancer patients.

A relative told ABC 7 News Tuesday that a former boyfriend from Maryland became obsessed with Carelsha.

'It scared her so she backed off from him, but her found her. When she came up here her found her,' the unnamed family member said.

Ana Murelo, Freeland-Gaither's grandmother, told the station that the grainy image of the person of interest in the ATM may bear some resemblance to the ex-boyfriend, whom she described as having a light complexion.

'The picture was not very clear, but if I had to say, it's a ppossibility' she said.

The FBI is offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of a suspect. That's in addition to rewards totaling $22,000 from local officials, bringing the total to $47,000 as of Tuesday evening. 

A witness reported seeing a woman identified as Freeland-Gaither screaming for help as she was forced into a dark gray four-door vehicle at about 9:40pm Sunday.

Police said Freeland-Gaither's glasses and cellphone were dropped on the street and she appeared to kick out several windows in the back of the vehicle.

The entire incident was captured on a surveillance video, which the Philadelphia Police Department released on YouTube Monday in a bid to generate tips.

The black-and-white footage, which is not accompanied by audio, begins with the suspect’s car coming to a stop in the 100 block of West Coulter Street.

A few seconds later, a man emerges from the vehicle, crosses the street and walks up the block, where he encounters the victim.

The woman is seen trying to get away from the suspect by crossing the street at the end of the block, but the man catches up with her on the corner and grabs her.

A struggle ensues, forcing the suspected kidnapper to drag Ms Freeland-Gaither kicking and screaming to the waiting car.

The 22-year-old puts up a valiant fight, at one point dropping to the ground in a desperate attempt to prevent her abductor from forcing her into the backseat, but the man overpowers the victim and shoves her inside the car. 

On Tuesday, the family held a press conference to plead for her return. Above Freeland-Gaither's grandfather Dereck Alston receives a hug from his daughter at the press conference

In the course of the struggle, another vehicle drives up to the suspect’s car but hurriedly backs away and makes a U-turn, allowing the kidnapper and his victim to get away. 

The unidentified kidnapper is described as a black male, 5 feet 10 inches tall with medium-heavy build, between 25 and 30 years old. He was last seen wearing a dark-colored jacket with a hood, possibly a hooded sweatshirt and a hat.

Police are also looking for the vehicle used in the kidnapping, which is believed to be a 2000-2002 dark-gray metallic four-door Ford Taurus with a Pennsylvania license plate, a rear spoiler, and windows broken out on the driver’s and passenger‘s side.

The sought sedan was last seen traveling west on Coulter Street towards Knox Street.

Freeland-Gaither is a 5-foot-3, 125-pound black female with brown eyes and braided hair. She was last seen wearing a light-blue denim jacket, a gray and white sweater, blue jeans and tan and green shoes, and she was carrying a black backpack.

Ambush: A Surveilance camera captured the suspect's Ford Taurus pull up in the 100 block of West Coulter Street in Germantown at 9.39pm Sunday

Suspect: The alleged kidnapper, a black male in his mid-20s or early 30s, exited the vehicle and crossed the street 

Approach: The man walked after Freeland-Gaither and caught up with her at the end of the block (pictured top right) 

Dragged away: The man was captured grabbing the 22-year-old woman and pulling her the length of the block to the waiting car 

Fighting for her life: Freeland-Gaither was heard by a witness screaming for help and she reportedly attempted to fight off the assailant 

Last-ditch effort: The frightened woman dropped down to the ground trying to prevent the abductor from throwing her into the backseat of the vehicle 

Overpowered: The suspect was able to subdue the woman enough to force her inside the car 

Missed opportunity: During the struggle, another car drove up to the suspect's vehicle, but the driver quickly retreated and took off from the scene

Her family say Gaither, who works as a nurse, was returning home from visiting her godson Sunday night, and they believe she may have been followed.

On Tuesday, held a press conference to address her captors, begging for her release. 

'Just release her,' her father, Carl Freeland, said. 'I’m not asking for anything else.'

'It was sickening and that’s the only thing you can say. It looks like that he even knew that she was coming around that corner because he parked his car and then went back for her,' aunt Latesha Tucker-Felder said.

Police spokesman Lt. John Stanford told Philly.com it appears from the video the suspect had been watching Freeland-Gaither and laying in wait for her, and that she likely did not know him.

Crime scene investigators who were seen working at the site of the kidnapping Monday recovered a glove and a knife.

Detectives say it does not look like the abduction was drug-related. City police are now working with state law enforcement and the FBI to locate the kidnapped woman and her abductor.

Sought: Police are looking for the vehicle used during the kidnapping, which is believed to be a 2000-2002 dark-gray metallic four-door Ford Taurus with a Pennsylvania license plate, a rear spoiler, and windows broken out on the driver’s and passenger‘s side.

The nurse’s father, Carl Freeland, appealed to his daughter’s kidnapper begging him to release Carlesha unharmed.

‘Please just send her back home,’ he told CBS News. ‘Just let my daughter go. Whatever you want, whatever you're asking for, I'll give it to you.’

On Monday evening, police announced that Mayor Michael Nutter has approved $10,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction in this case.

Anyone with information about the kidnapping of Freeland-Gaither's whereabouts is being asked to call Philadelphia police at 215-686-3353.
