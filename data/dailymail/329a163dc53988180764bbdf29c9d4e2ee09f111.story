Just after 6pm most weekdays, Christian Nanetti counts his tips and rushes out the door of the new Soho eaterie Estado. 

Nanetti is a waiter now, blending into the London crowds as he heads for the Tube station to make his way out to Ashford, Kent, to train with his new club Dover Athletic.

Four years ago Nanetti was an internet sensation, beating Raheem Sterling in Soccer AM’s iconic Skill Skool challenge in their battle over three rounds at QPR’s Harlington training centre.

The YouTube clip of their duel has attracted 384,000 views so far and watching it is like something out of the console game FIFA.

Both were blessed with exceptional talent and yet they both ended up at very different ends of the football spectrum?

This, then, is a cautionary tale.

Nanetti’s good friend Raheem, now 19, is regarded as the brightest young talent in English football by Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers and the national team’s head coach Roy Hodgson.

‘If I text him, he more or less texts me back straight away,’ reveals Nanetti. ‘Before the World Cup, when he was about to play Italy I sent him a text to say I was supporting him, not my country. I meant it.’

Back in the day there was little to choose between the pair, both wingers and working hard at their game in QPR’s academy teams.

‘When we heard Sky were coming, there was always a good chance we could be chosen because we were two of the most skilful players at the club,’ revealed Nanetti.

They learned their tricks by peeking over the fence to watch Adel Taarabt, then on loan from Tottenham, turn it on in first team training sessions.

From there, they practised until the round the world trick that Sterling and Nanetti routinely perform in the Skill Skool became second nature.

At 14, Sterling was so technically advanced that sometimes he was moved up a few levels to train with the first team. ‘He was that good,’ concedes Nanetti.

Watching that Skill Skool clip, battled over three rounds, it appears that the world is at their feet as they perform clever tricks and flicks in front of their team-mates.

Round by round they become more adventurous, encouraged by their team-mates and playing up to the camera crew. It’s good fun to watch.

Nanetti left his native Italy, where he was playing for a local side in Bologna, to sign a scholarship for QPR when he was 16.

He was a clever player, but he couldn’t convince the coaches - Steve Brown, Steve Garland, Marc Bircham and Keith Ryan - to give him a professional contract at the end of his two-year spell at Loftus Road.

By then, Sterling was on his way to Liverpool, but Nanetti couldn’t handle the rejection. The dream of making it professional was over.

Nanetti eventually won the Skill Skool competition after three rounds, but lost his place at QPR's academy

He was offered a short-term deal with Brighton, but he told them he wasn’t interested. ‘I lost my head, I was all over the place,’ Nanetti admits. ‘I didn’t do anything bad, nothing stupid, I come from a good family and my dad has always been there to guide me.

‘But I wanted to be a pro footballer, that’s all I wanted to do.’

When he went to Bradford City on trial for a week, he played well enough against Sheffield Wednesday in a practice match to be asked back for a second week. ‘I refused.’

He returned to Italy, to be with his family and friends for a few weeks while he worked it all out in his head. ‘I thought I was done with English football at first.’

In 2010, at the age of 18, he returned, playing for Raith Rovers in a Scottish FA Cup tie. He left, abruptly, when the club told him they couldn’t afford his wages.

Then came the turning point, finding some focus in his football career for the first time since he was a happy-go-lucky teenager at QPR.

He hooked up with Jamie Lawrence’s football academy in Wandsworth, south London, putting in the hours again and was backed by the former Bradford and Leicester midfielder. Few worked harder on the pitch than Lawrence in his day.

Nanetti’s journey has taken him into non-League football, establishing himself as one of the most exciting players to watch outside the pro game.

Since he knuckled down and worked at his game, he has played for Ashford Town in Middlesex, Lewes and Havant & Waterlooville before his summer move to Dover.

Last week, when Sterling was in Basle preparing for a Champions League group game with Liverpool, Nanetti scored against Aldershot in a 3-0 victory at Crabble Stadium.

‘I still believe I can become a professional, why else would I spend six years away from my friends and family?’

He was in the squad on Tuesday night in the Vanarama Conference Premier, travelling to Nuneaton Borough as his new club attempt to move away from the relegation zone.

To play on the same pitch as Sterling again seems fanciful, but Nanetti is determined to make it happen.

If he does, the days of waiting on tables will be over.
