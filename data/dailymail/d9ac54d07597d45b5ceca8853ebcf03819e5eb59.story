When Ollie Boorman advertised his 21st birthday party on Facebook, he hoped to attract a couple of hundred friends at most.

Inspired by a Hollywood film in which an unpopular student throws open his parents’ home to all-comers, he promised a night never to forget.

Unfortunately for his neighbours, that’s exactly what they got.

Happy birthday: Ollie Boorman, left, said seeing Alesha Dixon at his party was 'crazy' and said the event was  the 'best night ever'

More than 1,000 revellers – including 
Britain’s Got Talent judge Alesha Dixon – packed into his parents’ 
garden before spilling out into the street.

But while the party-goers in the village of Tewin, Hertfordshire, had a good time, neighbours were less impressed.

Police were called amid reports of thefts, smashed cars and fighting.

They launched a major operation, which
included closing a nearby road because of congestion caused by the 
number of cars arriving.

Out of control: Revellers turned up from as far away as Manchester to the party in Hertfordishire

Party: More than 1,000 people crowded into the Ollie Boorman's street after he advertised his birthday on Facebook

Chaos: Neighbours complained to police when the party, pictured, began to spiral out of control

Packed: Ollie Boorman said he expected about 200 people to turn up and was left shocked when five times that many arrived

They finally halted the party at 11pm, three hours after it started.

Boorman – whose parents were away in Dubai – is now counting the cost after he was charged with causing a public nuisance.

He admitted the offence at St Albans 
Magistrates’ Court and was given a community order under which he must 
serve an eight-week curfew between 8pm and 6am. He was also ordered to 
pay £500 compensation to Hertfordshire Police and £85 costs.

The court heard the computer engineer admitted the party, which his brother James, 18, also attended, had got ‘way out of hand’.

But he dismissed concerns after the court appearance, hailing it ‘the best night ever’.

‘It was a really good atmosphere. No 
one was getting into any trouble,’ he said. ‘At first when all these 
strangers showed up me and my brother were a bit worried. But everyone 
was really chilled out and it was really fun so we started having a good
time.

‘It was crazy when Alesha showed up. 
She said thanks for letting her come and told me it was a great party. 
She said she couldn’t believe how many people were there.’

Boorman added his parents Karen, 49, 
who works for John Lewis, and father Clive, 52, a salesman, gave their 
blessing for the event so long as any mess was ‘kept outside’.

‘We tidied up. We filled about 20 bin liners with rubbish and did about five trips to the tip,’ he said.

The party was called Project XXX in a 
reference to the film Project X about a teenager who throws a party to 
boost his popularity.

Word of the event spread like wildfire
as information was passed around on social networking sites and 
strangers from as far afield as Manchester turned up.

A spokesman for Miss Dixon, who lives 
in nearby Welwyn Garden City, said: ‘When she got there she realised it 
was not the sort of party she wanted to be at and left.’

One of Boorman’s neighbours, who asked
not to be named, said: ‘I felt like a prisoner in my own home. I was 
scared to go out. I’m amazed his parents were happy to go abroad knowing
what he planned.’

He also had the bare-faced cheek to pull a moonie

Taking some responsibility it appears that a pond or swimming pool has been cordoned off
