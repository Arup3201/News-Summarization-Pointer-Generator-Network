A bird-flipping cyclist was caught on camera after he allegedly lashed out at a couple driving along a Brisbane road on Sunday.

Police are now searching for the enraged cyclist who accused the couple of driving 'too close' to him and parked his bicycle in front of their car to block their way.

The couple claimed the cyclist then allegedly opened the back door of their car, pulled out their laptop on the back seat and threw it on the ground, reported Brisbane Times.

A cyclist was on Brisbane Corso at Yeronga - south of Brisbane - when he lashed out at a couple in a car

'The man [on the bicycle] came up alongside their car and requested they wind down the window,' a police spokeswoman told Brisbane Times.

'He then accused them of travelling too close to him.'

The couple, who were driving along the Brisbane Corso at Yeronga - south of Brisbane, lodged a formal complaint to police about the cyclist's verbal attack although their laptop was not damaged.

A photo of the angered cyclist, taken by the male passenger, was released by police.

He was dressed in a fluoro top, fold-up jeans, gloves, backpack, sunglasses and a helmet.

Anyone with information should contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
