Simon Cowell told Lettice that she had both talent and personality

Bizarre, quirky but brilliantly entertaining, Britain's Got Talent has once again proved that no one does eccentricity quite like us.

Now, after weeks of mesmerising magicians and dynamic dance troupes, hundreds of contestants have been whittled down to the last 45. So who will pick up the £250,000 prize and perform at the Royal Variety Performance? Weekend meets six of the hopefuls still in with a chance...

THE HIPPY VIOLINIST

You can see why posh Lettice Rowbotham, 24, struggled with life in an orchestra. She can't keep still for a second. 'People think I'm drunk most of the time, even when I'm sober,' she says.

She won a standing ovation from the judges a few weeks ago when Simon Cowell told her, 'Not only are you brilliant, but you have a fantastic personality as well.'

And Lettice says that's driven her on. 'Being on BGT has given me so much encouragement. If I make it to the final I'm going to play my own stuff and really surprise people.'

Surrey-born Lettice demanded a violin from her parents at the age of four after seeing buskers playing them and composed her first tune on it in a day. She won a scholarship to the prestigious Purcell School of music but left after a year. 'Musicians are very  competitive and focused while I just want to play because I love it,' she says.

She moved to Greece to teach windsurfing and spent her winters in Switzerland skiing and playing her violin on the roof of a nightclub, clips of which were posted on YouTube.

She claims she isn't after fame and fortune. 'I'm worried about the environment so I'd like to plant a tree for every gig I do,' she says airily. 'And I'd love to encourage kids to leave their laptops alone. Pick up an instrument instead!'

THE GYRATING GRANNY

Dancer Paddy Jones, 79, says her life's been a whirlwind since her electrifying audition. In the early moments of her routine she was buzzed by Simon, but by the time her jaw-dropping performance with her Spanish dance partner Nico was over he'd repented, telling her, 'I apologise for buzzing a little early before all the crazy things happened - it went ballistic.'

Amanda adored her so much she pressed the golden buzzer, sending her straight through to the semi-finals. 'It's been manic ever since,' says Paddy. 'I could do with putting a bag over my head because so many people are asking for my autograph.'

Paddy was a professional dancer until
 the age of 22 but gave it up to have a family. She started again a 
decade ago after her husband David died of cancer 18 months after they'd
 moved to Spain. Nico ran the local dance school and he and Paddy began 
performing together.

They've
 already won one Spanish TV talent show, where she gave the Simon 
Cowell-esque judge on that particular panel a piece of her mind. 'He 
started having a go at Nico saying, "What do you think you're doing 
hauling that old lady around?" So I said, "Your mother would be ashamed 
at what you're saying!"' she recalls.

'The
 audience went bananas.' She and Nico then decided to  audition for BGT 
in Britain. Now she's dreaming of performing at the Royal Variety, 
especially if the Queen attends. 'I would die happy knowing I'd done 
that,' she says with a smile.

Paddy Jones, 79, shocked the audience when she performed some very daring dance moves

THE VENTRILOQUIST WITH TOURETTE'S

Sam Jones, 21, admits that ventriloquism is an odd choice of career - but it's the only thing that makes him happy. Sam, who's from Seaford in East Sussex, has suffered from Tourette's syndrome all his life. He's always come out with funny voices, and ventriloquism provides an outlet for them.

'I've always been obsessed with different characters and voices,' he says. 'What I love about ventriloquism is I can combine the two.'

He taught himself from a library book when he was six, although as a keen magician too (he auditioned for BGT several years ago doing magic), ventriloquism was only a sideline at first. But it gradually took over and he now  has more than 20 puppets, although Baby Leo - with whom he auditioned on last week's show - has become his firm favourite.

'He's loveable but cheeky and mischievous. People seem to connect with him straight away,' says Sam.

Sam still shows some signs of Tourette's and  hopes that he can help people be more sympathetic towards the condition. 'I was bullied at school and things felt  quite tough when I was growing up,' he says.

'But that's over now; I've learned to be proud of my Tourette's. A lot of people with Tourette's control it with creativity; they play the drums or piano. Mine has been through the puppets. You can still see it; my head moves, my eyes blink and I still tend to shout out, but I wouldn't be me without this condition.'

REAformed have already earned a place in the semi-final after Alesha pressed her golden buzzer during their performance

THE GLAMOUR  GIRL GROUP

Girlie trio REAformed - Alexis Economou, 21, Renetta Eagle, 19, and Ebony Cantwell, 16 - told judge Alesha Dixon, who used to be in girl group Mis-Teeq, she was their inspiration at their audition. Alesha reciprocated  by pressing the golden buzzer.

And now they're starting to think they have what it takes to be  successful. They've already had unwanted exposure when it was revealed that Alexis, from Pimlico in south-west London, was once caught smuggling drugs to a boyfriend in jail. 'That was a mistake I'm going to regret for the rest of my life,' she says. 'I know people will judge me by it but I hope they can forgive me.'

All three of them come from single-parent homes and have been singing all their lives. Renetta and Ebony, who are both from Oxford, met on the local talent competition circuit. They were introduced to Alexis, who was desperate to get into a girl band, by her cousin and instantly hit it off.

'We've been together for six months now and we couldn't have asked for a better start,' says Renetta. At their audition, Simon told them to work on their harmonies if they wanted to live up to the potential Alesha saw in them. 'We've been practising like mad,' says Renetta. 'This is important for us; we want to be the next Destiny's Child.'

Patsy won the audience (and Ant and Dec) over with her quick wit

THE BLUE-SKINNED DIVA

Fuzzy, pink-haired New Yorker Patsy May doesn't like to reveal her age. However, her friend (and, it has to be said, the woman behind her success) Laura Bacon from Cambridge reveals Patsy is 34.

How would Patsy describe herself? 'My style is influenced by  the Muppets but I'm not affiliated to them.'

Simon was so impressed with her audition he said he could see her in Amanda's chair on the judging panel next year, but like many in showbusiness she's an odd mixture of supreme confidence and crippling insecurity.

The latter comes out when she wonders aloud whether she's in the show 'because I'm a token blue; I hope they haven't put me through just be-cause of my colour.'

Although Patsy is a talented singer she'd quite like to find fame and fortune the easy way; by marrying into it. 'My favourite type of men are celebrities with money,' she trills.

'And they seem to like me. Did you see me on This Morning with Phillip Schofield? He went all shaky and stuttery.' She doesn't have a favourite male celebrity in mind but reveals she's already planning to drop Ant and Dec (or Anton Dec as she insists on calling them) from her act after they performed with her at her audition.

'I love them so much,' she gushes. 'But I'm going to have to move on. I hope performing with me gave their careers a much-needed boost, though.'

James Smith, 15, ticked all of Simon Cowell's boxes

THE PINT-SIZED CROONER

Cute-as-a-cupcake with dimply cheeks and boyband hair, 15-year-old James Smith from Upminster in Essex surely ticks all the boxes for Simon Cowell. He sat his first GCSE the day before we meet yet he earned a standing ovation from both the audience and judges at his audition with his unbelievable rendition of Nina Simone's Feeling Good.

Today he's hoping he not only does well in his exams, but can make the Britain's Got Talent final too. 'I believe I've got the potential to win it... maybe,' he says. 'The thing I'm most worried about is what Simon will say. He's the one I want to impress most. He knows everything and if he doesn't like me, I think I might just give it up.'

Despite the reception he got at his audition his parents are determined to keep his feet on the ground. 'After I was on TV that first time my phone didn't stop ringing and I was looking at it constantly, so my mum took it away and told me it was all going to my head,' he shrugs.

'They're also making me work really hard on my GCSEs. If the music doesn't work out I need to be prepared to work in a bank or something boring.' With 30,000 new followers on Twitter and a school full of girls suddenly going giggly when they see him, that's looking highly unlikely.

Britain's Got Talent semi-finals start Monday night at 7.30pm on ITV.
