US dog owners are involved in specialist 'boot camps' so owners can get fit while exercising their pets. 

Jill Bowers from California has engaged a team of personal trainers to help dog owners get fit. 

Ms Bowers, 38, said she developed the idea after she needed to lose three and a half stone.

Dog owners get the opportunity to increase their fitness while training their pets 

She noticed after engaging on a vigorous exercise regime, she was too tired to take her dog, Quinn, for a walk. 

The mother-of-two developed the 'Thank Dog! Bootacamp!' to increase her fitness and to help with the obedience of her dog. 

She said: 'I was 40 pounds overweight and as a dog trainer it's hard to train very hyper or aggressive dogs while being out of shape.

'I was unhappy with myself and joined a bootcamp style workout which is the only thing that has ever worked for me.

'And as I started to attend more classes, I lost the 40 pounds.

'But I would come home and be too tired to exercise my active dog, so I decided to come up with something that would combine the two.

'Something that would give me just as hard of a workout, but also including the dog so obedience training and exercise could be accomplished in just one hour.'

Jill Bowers, said it is possible to improve your fitness and your dog's obedience in just one hour 

Up to 12 dogs and their owners meet up in Burbank, Los Angeles on a daily basis for the boot camp

Ms Bowers has expanded her system across eight different locations as well as creating a smartphone app

Ms Bowers hosts the workouts in Burbank, Los Angeles five days a week with up to 12 dogs and their owners. 

She has also expanded her system to eight different locations across America and there is now even a smartphone app. 

She added: 'The dogs are involved in all cardio aspects, as well as being trained in obedience at the same time.

'We make sure that the owners keep moving while the dogs are instructed to do commands.

'Before they come to our classes all dogs and owners have to do a one on one consultation to learn some commands and cardio handling techniques.

'We have had great feedback and have helped so many people and their dogs.'

Ms Bowers ensures that while the owners are keeping fit they have to issue commands to their dogs 

Ms Bowers said it is difficult of a dog owner to control their hyper-active pet if they are overweight
