A lesbian couple are threatening to sue for discrimination after being refused a family ticket to a bowling alley with their two sons.

Michelle Giddins and Gemma Lloyd, both 28, who have been together since February, say they and their boys were upset to be told that families were made up of a husband and wife and two children.

But the boss of the Palace Superbowl company hit back at Miss Giddins, saying: ‘She’s not the only gay in the village – she wasn’t refused a ticket because of her sexuality, but because of her foul language.’

Michelle Giddins, with sons Joshua, 6, and Matthew, 5, and partner Gemma Lloyd. The family claim they were discriminated against at a local bowling alley after trying to get a 'family deal'

He said the firm has gay directors and the manager of its other branch is gay.

The very modern dispute – which 
carries echoes of a damages claim last year won by a gay couple barred 
from a bed and breakfast – broke out at the Palace Superbowl in 
Orpington, Kent.

Miss Giddins and Miss Lloyd, who live
together in nearby Bexley, were having a day out with their respective 
children from previous heterosexual relationships – Joshua, six, and 
Matthew, five.

The pair, who are planning to enter a
civil partnership in August next year, said they asked for a family 
ticket at £15.50, because buying individual tickets for two adults and 
two children would have cost £18.70.

Miss Giddins, a delivery driver for 
Asda, said: ‘The man looked at me blankly, then I said it a lot slower 
to try and get him to understand.

‘He said a husband and a wife and two
children is a family – that made me mad. We had to prove we were a 
family so I showed the manager a picture of us which I had in my purse 
of us all together.

‘We are never going back. I did swear
when I was there, but only because we were being discriminated against 
in front of the children. I’m now looking into whether I can take legal 
action.’

But Palace Superbowl in Orpington, south east London, said the couple were not denied the deal because of their sexuality, but instead for a 'tirade of foul language' they used against staff

Palace Superbowl has two branches, the other being at Elephant and Castle in south London.

Managing director Patrick Duffy said a
mechanic was on the front desk at the time the lesbian couple arrived, 
and he wanted to make sure the family paid the right amount.

‘His worry wasn’t about the same-sex couple, his worry was he was going to let two people get together to get a cheaper deal.

‘He just said “Wait a moment” because
he did not want to get into trouble for manipulating the system and he 
said he would get the manager because he is just the mechanic.

‘Then the lady went into a tirade of 
abuse. She wasn’t refused because of any misunderstanding about a family
ticket or her sexuality, she was refused because of the foul language.

‘I’m not being funny here but she’s 
not the only gay in the village. The company has gay directors and the 
manager of the Elephant and Castle bowling alley is gay.’

Last October bed-and-breakfast owner 
Suzanne Wilkinson from Cookham in Berkshire was ordered to pay £3,600 in
damages for ‘hurt feelings’ to a gay couple who she refused to let 
share a room.
