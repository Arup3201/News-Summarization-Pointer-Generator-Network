A Chinese newspaper has accused the US makers of computer game Battlefield 4 of 'demonising' their country with 'cultural aggression'.

The article, which appeared in military paper Zhongguo Guofangbao last week, also accuses American company Electronic Arts of discrediting China with 'cultural aggression'.

The editorial also criticised the plot as 'making no sense' and the language used as 'profane'.

Battlefield 4, in which players fight as American soldiers against China, has been criticised by a Chinese newspaper for 'demonising' the country with 'cultural aggression'

In the story mode of the first person shooter game, players take control of an American soldier in a conflict against a rouge Chinese general and missions include an attack on Beijing.

According to the South China Morning Post, the comment piece read: 'When western countries would make war games in the past, they would settle on Russia if they needed an imaginary enemy.

'But in recent years, with the boosting of China’s national strength, China threat theories run rampant, and foreign companies are increasingly keen to put the Sino-US conflict in their games as a gimmick to attract attention.

'The use of video games…to discredit one country’s image in the eyes of other countries is a new form of cultural penetration and aggression.'

In the article Wang Jiahang, an associate professor of journalism at the China University of Political Science and Law, said that the game would distort the values of young people.

Battlefield 4 is the latest offering in the Battlefield series from US company Electronic Arts. The games have pitted players against Middle Eastern terrorists, space soldiers and Nazis in the past

Ma Zhengang, vice director for the China Public Diplomacy Association, added that Chinese people should rise up against the image of China the video game presents.

The original article was commented on hundreds of times, with some pointing out that the newspaper may have been missing the point.

'Exploboom' wrote: 'I had the feeling that the Chinese were portrayed extremely positively in Battlefield 4.

'In the [game], you actually work with the Chinese military to stop this rogue general, who'd tried to have a promising new leader assassinated and subsequently framed the US as the perpetrators in order to orchestrate a war.'

Battlefield 4 is the latest offering in the Battlefield series, which has previously featured Middle Eastern terrorists, futuristic space soldiers and Nazis as enemies for players to fight against.
