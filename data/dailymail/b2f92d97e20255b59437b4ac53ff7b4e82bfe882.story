Shot: Jamarcus Allen, of Akron, Ohio, is believed to have shot himself accidentally with his father's gun on Wednesday

A 4-year-old boy shot himself dead with his father's gun in Ohio on Wednesday. 

Jamarcus Allen, remembered as an energetic boy who loved superheroes like Spider-man and Batman, first found his father Terrance's pistol last week, according to the Akron Beacon Journal.

It was usually hidden in the bathroom of their family home on McKinley Avenue but Jamarcus's older brother Tyree, 18, discovered him playing with it.

His mother, Jamella Allen, scolded her youngest son and ordered her husband to get rid of the weapon.

However, it appears he didn't and the curious 4-year-old got hold of the same weapon again while traveling in his father's car on Wednesday morning.

The pair were returning from dropping off Tyree at school when it appears Jamarcus accidentally shot himself in the head.

Witnesses told the local paper a single bullet hole was visible in the car roof above the passenger seat as well as a pool of blood in the foot-well.

Jamarcus was rushed to Akron Children's Hospital but died of his injuries.  

48-year-old Allen has now been charged with involuntary manslaughter, felony child endangering, having weapons under disability and tampering with evidence.

Police Lt. Rick Edwards said investigators recovered the weapon inside the sedan, according to the Journal

'It appears the child got ahold of the gun and shot accidentally inside the car,' Edwards said.

Allen pulled over at 9.30am on South Arlington Street and flagged down a passing police car.

Witness Robert Leslie told the newspaper: 'The cop approached the vehicle and the guy just laid on the ground and he had a child in his arms. He was talking to the guy, I don’t know what he was asking him, and then all of a sudden, the officer finally yanked really hard, grabbed the [boy] and ran to the ambulance and the ambulance just took off like crazy.'

Jamarcus' mother said her son just didn't know the reality of firearms. 

'Jamarcus was a child, he liked guns, but he didn’t know it was real,” she said

'Jamarcus wouldn’t stop. He was so full of life. The only way he would stop was when he would fall asleep. That’s the only thing that would slow him down.

Charged: Jamarcus' father Terrance Allen has been charged with involuntary manslaughter following the shooting in his car on Wednesday. It is believed his 4-year-old son accidentally shot himself with his gun

'I love him to death. He would say, ‘I love you, Mommy’ all the time. He was a fun-loving little boy and now he’s gone.'

'I don’t know. I’m going crazy wondering what happened,' she added.

The boy’s grandmother, Shirley Colvin, added: 'Jamarcus was a beautiful person. He was so sweet. I just loved him and he loved everybody.'

Jamella and Terrance Allen had previously requested a divorce but were said to be working through their difficulties, according to the report.

They still lived together in the home alongside Jamarcus and his brother, Jamella's 18-year-old son Tyree Ruggs

According to the report, Terrance Allen had a prior felony burglary conviction which barred him from carrying or owning a firearm.
