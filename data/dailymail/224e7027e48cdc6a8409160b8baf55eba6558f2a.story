Single thongs across Australia now have the chance to find a 'solemate'.

At least that’s what a new online service hopes to provide, and with a tagline of It’s like Tinder for Thongs, the chance is now there for that single and lonely ‘lefty’ or ‘righty’ to find a new life partner.

Adelaide man Karl Gautam is the brains behind the new venture that started off as a laugh on Facebook, but has since become a huge fashion sensation. 

Adelaide's Karl Gautam wants single thongs to find the perfect partner

HavyMatch Facebook page is trying to get the right match for thongs who are now on their own

Thanks to Mr Gautam all you have to do is upload a photograph or write a description of the required thong onto his HavyMatch Facebook page and wait for a match. When a proper match has been made they send it to you for a mailing fee of $7.50.

'I was cleaning out my cupboard and I noticed I had a few single thongs. I didn't want to throw them out as they were in too good a nick,' Mr Gautam told Daily Mail Australia.

'So I went on my Facebook page and asked if anyone had any thongs that could match up with any of them.  

These single thongs were washed up on an Adelaide river bank. HavyMatch is hoping to stop this and make a difference environmentally 

'One of my mates got back to me with one which was the right size. I told my mates about this and they got on Facebook asking me if I could find them one. It was then I thought that there maybe some legs in this idea.' 

He set up the HavyMatch Facebook page 11 weeks ago and now has more than 1,100 followers. 

What started out as a bit of fun suddenly exploded into life and it soon became clear that the Facebook page wasn't the right platform for the endeavour. 

It soon became clear that there was a market for people looking for replacement thongs 

'For this reason I have some IT people in Melbourne working on a dedicated website that will make it really easy to look for a thong,' he said. 

'It'll be set up similarly to those 'classified ad' style websites. The website is hopefully around six weeks away and will be called havymatch.com.au.' 

The 36-year-old, who works as fitter and turner in South Australia's copper mines, also realised that although he'd started it all off as a bit of a lark there was a serious point to the idea of finding a match for your thong.  

The sight every holiday-maker hates to see on their return home - the dreaded single thong in the suitcase

'A friend was walking along beside a river near my house and he collected about 40 single thongs that had been washed up on the bank after heavy rain,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 

'His point was that if people are swapping thongs they wouldn't be throwing them away like this. It would make a big difference to the environment. 

'I realised that there was also a serious side to all this. And that it could make a difference environmentally.' 

Rather than throwing them away, thongs of all shapes and sizes could still  be of use 

It's all the better too as his habit of wearing odd thongs was causing a few problems at home. 

'My wife gives me a lot of grief about it. I've a righty that is red and white and a lefty that is black and blue,' he said. 

Now he can argue that although he may not win any style competitions, at least he's being environmentally friendly. 

Mr Gautam believes that even wearing odd thongs is better than having just the one
