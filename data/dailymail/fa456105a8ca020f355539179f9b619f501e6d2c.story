Aside from a brief absence to serve in the U.S. Army in World War II, Goldman has worked at Capitol Lighting since 1941.

The store says he was first hired to sell items and stock and clean the displays.

'He was very devoted to his wife, who 
was a wonderful lady who also worked for us,' store co-owner Max Lebersfeld told News 12. 'She passed away, but he came back from that.'

He worked for a number of years as a store manager, but recently is happier in his workshop, where he reconstructs fixtures.

Co-worker Sandy Ronco says Goldman specializes in rebuilding items that were damaged or unusable.

'Each one is a challenge and that's it,' he told News 12. 'Each one gives you something that the last one didn't.'

Goldman lives in nearby Whippany and still drives himself to work in a 1999 Ford Contour.

Herman Goldman was already a local celebrity when he turned 96. He told  ABC News: 'I feel great, I'm standing up straight, so I feel great'
