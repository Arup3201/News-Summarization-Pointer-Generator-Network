Mike Brown has spoken for the first time about ‘one of the worst experiences of my life’ — missing out on a precious England cap.

The 29-year-old full-back returns against Scotand on Saturday, a month after being knocked unconscious 12 minutes into England’s victory over Italy.

Brown missed the defeat by Ireland after experiencing headaches while attempting to complete strict return-to-play protocols.

After agonising about owning up to his symptoms, knowing it would see him miss the trip to Dublin, he reluctantly alerted team doctors about his concussion.

‘Pulling out is one of the worst things I’ve ever had to go through in my whole life,’ Brown said. ‘As a sportsman everything you work towards is pulling on your country’s jersey and representing everyone in the country.

‘I went to see the doctor about 8.30 in the morning — I usually get up about 7.30 to 8 — and during that time I was sat in my room thinking should I try the next stage, should I carry on? I’ve trained through headaches before so I could definitely have trained on and seen how it went.

‘But it wouldn’t have been good preparation for the team or me having that in the back of my mind. And obviously there’s the serious implications of the dangers and the risks involved.

‘The way I am, stubborn, desperate to play for my country, I probably would have (hidden symptoms in the past). But we’re all aware of it now and the example has been set by the England medical team and the coaching staff here for everyone else to see.’

Brown, who wins his 36th cap on Saturday, watched England’s defeat at home with his fiancee Eliza. ‘I was fuming, he said. 

‘I wasn’t happy at all. Unfortunately, my fiancee had to go through it with me, poor lady. It wasn’t something I want to be doing too regularly, sat in my lounge, on the edge of my sofa, screaming at the TV!’

The England star admitted it was a bitter blow to be absent for the game in Dublin, but he had to be honest
