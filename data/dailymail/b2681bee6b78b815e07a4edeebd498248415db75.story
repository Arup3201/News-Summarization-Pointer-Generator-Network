It's not just people who are wrapping up warm this weekend. 

The Northeast could see its coldest day in 20 years - and this farm of cows is ready for it. 

King Brothers Dairy in Saratoga County, New York, has kitted out their cattle in ear muffs and jackets in a desperate bid to protect them from frostbite.

And in case that doesn't work, they have rotated the calves' hutches to face south so they have the maximum exposure to sunlight.

Freezing gales are set to pummel the snow-blighted Northeast this weekend, causing dangerous 'white out' conditions in the bitter cold.

The winds - with peak speeds of 75mph - are being predicted for Sunday, while across the region temperatures hover not far above 0°F.

Frigid temperatures combined with the high winds will being outside in the worst-hit areas feel more like standing in a brutal -21°F, according to forecasters.

In areas hit by extreme snowfall in recent weeks, the driving wind could whip up snow on the ground and cut visibility virtually to zero, putting lives at risk for any caught outside unexpectedly.

The strong winds could also cause chaos by felling trees and destroying above-ground power lines, leading to outages across the pummeled frozen areas - some of which will be colder than they have been for some 20 years.

According to the Weather Channel, the strong storm will blow in from over the Great Lakes through Friday, with the strongest gusts hitting the eastern seaboard Saturday night.

The strong winds will continue to whip the areas through Sunday, when the strongest of the storm is expected to strike.

Winds, pushing from west to east, will hit hardest along the coast, with Cape Cod and Nantucket in Massachusetts due 60mph-75mph blasts.

Cities near the coat, including Portland, Maine, Boston, and New York City are set for winds as high as 50mph.

The totals easily surpass the 39mph classification needed for the National Weather Service to declare the winds gale-force. 

Major settlements further in land such as Philadelphia and Washington could still feel 40mph gusts around midday Sunday, according to forecast models.

The storm could bring modest amount of snow as well, with the already-pummeled Boston area due as much as 6 inches more.

A single inch more snow will make this February the snowiest in the Massachusetts capital since records began some 120 years ago.

Authorities have issued warnings to coincide with the freezing weather, with New York City mayor Bill de Blasio telling residents to stay inside if the can.

As the mercury barreled towards a lowly 9°F, de Blasio said: ''Stay indoors if you don’t have to be out. Any prolonged exposure could be dangerous.'

Early Sunday wind chills are expected to hit -20°F - cold enough for frost bite to hit unexposed skin within half an hour.  

Conditions could even be the worst they have been in years.

'Sunday could be the coldest day in at least 20 years,' said de Blasio.

This all comes as thousands have flocked to the city for the biannual New York Fashion Week, with shows scheduled all weekend.
