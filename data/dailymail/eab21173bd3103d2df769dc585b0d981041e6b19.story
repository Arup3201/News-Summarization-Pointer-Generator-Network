New York City police are hunting for brazen thieves who stole a $200,000 backhoe from a construction site, then used it to ram a glass wall and claw out an ATM machine at a bank in Queens.

Officers say the suspects left the machine running when they fled the 
Chase Bank branch in Maspeth at around 3.15 am on Friday morning.

The backhoe was reported missing from a nearby construction site. Police say
it's unclear if any money was actually taken, but the investigation is continuing.

Brazen thieves: New York City police are hunting for brazen thieves who stole a $200,000 backhoe from a construction site, then used it to ram a glass wall and claw out an ATM machine at a bank in Queens

The cheeky crooks broke through the wall of the bank at 48th Street and 54th Avenue.

While the backhoe operator was able to 
get the ATM out of the building, it was then left at the scene as the 
thieves seemingly couldn't pry it open.

'They drove a bulldozer right through the glass,' a woman who saw the aftermath told the New York Post. 'There is just glass and debris everywhere. It's destroyed.Â 

A worker at the Trocom Construction Corp. yard, from where the machine went missing, told the New York Daily News: 'It's pretty wild. We've had machines stolen before, but no one's ever pulled off a bank heist with them.'

Albert Valcarcel, a construction worker working on a different job, told the paper that the suspect must have had some experience in operating construction machinery.

'Whoever did this must have known what he was doing and been prepared,' Mr Valcarcel said.

Detectives say this case is part of a pattern of several smash-and-grab 
thefts. The suspects use tools, vehicles or construction equipment to 
break into ATMs.

Most thefts occur in the early morning hours. They're mostly in Brooklyn and Queens.
