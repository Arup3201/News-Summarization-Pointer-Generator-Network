Contestants on I’m A Celebrity at least have plenty of warning of the emotional turmoil the challenges of the jungle are likely to present.

But the ITV show reached disturbing new lows when a seven-year-old girl was the one left in distress.

Producers were accused of cruelty after the child was put up as a prize – and had to be consoled when her mother failed to ‘win’ her.

Distraught: Charlie Brooks was devastated to learn that she was inches away from her daughter

So close: Charlie's daughter was disappointed that she missed out on seeing her mother

Hundreds of viewers took to social 
networking sites and internet discussion forums yesterday to complain 
about the treatment of Kiki, the daughter of jungle competitor and 
former EastEnders actress Charlie Brooks.

Miss Brooks had been paired with a 
fellow contestant, darts champion Eric Bristow, and given the 
opportunity to win luxuries by choosing one of five doors to open.

They did not know that behind the 
doors the prizes included food, clean clothes – and various members of 
their friends and family. Kiki, who had been away from her mother for 18
days, was standing behind a yellow door.

The youngster could hear her mother’s 
voice and was heartbroken when Miss Brooks and Mr Bristow picked the 
wrong colour to reveal a sign which said ‘game over’.

Millions of 
viewers saw Kiki’s distress as she realised she would not see her mother
and had to be consoled by one of Mr Bristow’s sons, who was next to 
her.

Tough blow: Charlie described learning that her daughter could have been so close was like being 'kicked in the gut'

Pulling at the heartstrings: Charlie was left in tears at the thought of her daughter being so close

It was only after learning that two 
fellow contestants had got to see their loved ones that Miss Brooks, 31,
realised she had missed the opportunity to see her daughter.

She was left distraught and  made a 
tearful apology to the cameras, saying: ‘It felt like someone had taken a
boot and kicked me in the guts.

'I didn’t even think having a member of 
family behind the  door would have been an option. This is 
heartbreaking.’

Yesterday experts and campaigners 
called on TV watchdog Ofcom to investigate the decision to involve Kiki 
in the contest, which is filmed in Australia, while others accused Miss 
Brooks of bad parenting for not leaving the jungle to comfort her 
daughter as soon as she learned what had happened.

What's behind each door: Charlie and Eric were first to have a go at the Door to Door game, she didn't know her daughter Kiki was behind the yellow door

End of the line: The pair chose the blue door and were greeted with a 'game over' sign

Margaret Morrissey, of campaign group 
Parents Outloud, said: ‘If [Charlie Brooks] was genuine about this, she 
would have got up and walked straight to her daughter and not put her 
daughter in this position again.

‘I find it staggering that [producers] have used a child in this way. To involve a seven-year-old is sinking to the bottom.’

The stunt comes just days after 
producers were accused of failing to look after comedian Brian Conley, 
51, who has battled depression and alcoholism. He left the jungle after 
becoming distressed and was admitted to hospital.

Viewers took to the internet to 
express their outrage at Kiki’s treatment. One wrote: ‘For such a small 
child to hear her mother’s voice and look so desolate when she didn’t 
get to see her isn’t sitting comfortably with me.’

Another agreed, adding: ‘ITV should 
hang their heads in shame!’ Roy Shuttleworth, a consultant in clinical 
psychology, said the game amounted to a ‘high-risk strategy’, adding: 
‘Some children would be tormented by it.’

A spokesman for the ITV show said 
permission for the girl to take part in the game had come from her 
grandmother, adding: ‘A senior producer saw Kiki afterwards and she was 
fine.  Kiki and her grandma come to the jungle every day with the other 
friends and family, so the experience wasn’t as out of the ordinary as 
it might look.’

An agent for Miss Brooks refused to comment on why Kiki was not at school.
