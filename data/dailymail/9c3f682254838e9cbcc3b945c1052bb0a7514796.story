Charles Duke's family on the moon's surface after he placed it there during the Apollo 16 mission

It's a little known fact but a family has been on the moon for more than 40 years.

Apollo 16 astronaut Charles Duke didn't just leave footprints when he visited the lunar surface, he left a photograph of his family.

On 23 April 1972,  astronauts Charlie Duke and John Young embarked on a mission to explore the moon's Descartes Highlands in a Lunar Roving 
Vehicle.

Before setting up a Solar Wind Collector, Lunar Module pilot Duke left a photograph of himself with his wife and their two sons, Thomas and Charles, sitting on a bench. It remains there til this day.

The reverse of the photo is signed by 
Duke's family and bears the message: 'This is the family of Astronaut 
Duke from Planet Earth. Landed on the Moon, April 1972.'

Duke photographed the family picture with a Hasselblad camera as it rested on the dusty surface next to one of his boot prints.

The image was unearthed in the Project Apollo Image Archive, which serves as an online reference source and repository of digital images pertaining to the historic manned lunar landing programme.

He also left a commemorative medal issued by the United States Air Force, which was celebrating its 25th anniversary in 1972.

Apollo 16 was the tenth manned mission in the United States Apollo space programme, the fifth to land on the Moon and the first to land in the lunar highlands.

It was crewed by Commander John Young, Lunar Module Pilot Charles Duke and Command Module Pilot Ken Mattingly.

Launched from the Kennedy Space Center
 in Florida on April 16, 1972, the mission lasted 11 days, 1 hour, and 
51 minutes, and concluded on April 27.

It
 was also the second flight of the Lunar Roving Vehicle which was used 
to transport Young and Duke 26.7 kilometres across the moon's surface.

At the age of 36, Duke became the tenth and youngest human to walk on the Moon.

After setting foot on the lunar 
surface, Duke exclaimed: 'Fantastic! Oh, that
 first foot on the lunar surface is super!

The pair spent just under three days on the moon's surface, during which 
they conducted three extra-vehicular activities or moonwalks, totaling 
20 hours and 14 minutes, and collected 95.8 kilograms of lunar samples to take back to Earth.

Samples
 from the Descartes Formation and the Cayley Formation disproved the 
previously held belief that the formations were volcanic in origin.

While
 the pair explored the moon's surface,  Command Module Pilot Ken Mattingly 
stayed in the module to perform observations from above.

The Command Module landed in the Pacific Ocean 350 km southeast of Christmas Island, 290 hours after lift-off. The spacecraft and its crew was retrieved by the USS Ticonderoga.

Charles Duke now lives with Dottie, his wife of more than 40 years, in a town outside San Antonio, Texas. He is a Christian lay witness and is said to be active in prison ministry.
