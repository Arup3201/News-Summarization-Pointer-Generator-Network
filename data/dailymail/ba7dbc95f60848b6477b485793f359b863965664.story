Belgian police have launched an investigation into hate preacher Anjem Choudary’s YouTube rants, it emerged yesterday. 

The married father of four, who receives an estimated £25,000 in benefits, is being probed over allegations he incited violence and threatened terrorist attacks in Britain and Belgium.

Details of the Belgian inquiry emerged days after Scotland Yard officers went to Choudary’s East London home to help his family go into hiding in the aftermath of the murder of soldier Lee Rigby.

Help: Critics say the police should stop Choudary's hate-filled speeches on the internet, rather than running up costs protecting his family from threats following the Woolwich terror

Evacuation: A member of Choudary's family are ushered out of their home. Information was later released by Belgian police that they are investigating allegations that Anjem Choudary incited violence and terror

Baby: A woman, believed to be Anjem Choudary's wife, is escorted from the house by a female police officer, while carrying a young child

Critics say the Metropolitan Police 
should concentrate on stopping his hate-filled speeches on the internet,
 rather than running up costs protecting his family from people furious 
about the atrocity in Woolwich last week.

In a new outburst unconnected to the 
Belgian investigation, Choudary yesterday blamed David Cameron for a 
‘crusade’ against Islam which is turning young British Muslims into 
potential terrorists.

Officials in Belgium – which has 
recently passed new anti-terror laws under which websites inciting 
violence can be banned – said Choudary and a colleague, Abu Rahin Aziz, 
are being probed over comments they made in two videos posted on 
YouTube.

If the authorities decide to prosecute them, both men face the prospect of being deported from the UK to face terrorism charges.

Peter Mertens, a spokesman for 
Belgium’s ‘Crisis Centre’, which deals with the threat posed by Muslim 
extremists, confirmed that security officials were studying both videos 
to determine whether laws have been broken.

He said investigators may be in touch with their counterparts in London for assistance.

Choudary’s video of hate, called Message Of Support For Abu Imran, was posted on May 8 and has clocked up 17,818 views.

It is still on the internet and was 
released in protest at the imprisonment of the leader of a group called 
Sharia4Belgium, which is backed by Choudary and other leading Islamic 
militants.

Imran, whose real name is Fouad 
Belkacem, was arrested in June  last year and is serving a two-year 
prison sentence for inciting  hatred and violence towards non-Muslims in
 a video also posted to YouTube.

During the near seven-minute video, 
Choudary said: ‘So we say from England that we never spoke the truth 
because our leaders, so-called leaders, said so – like Blair or Brown, 
or indeed Cameron.

‘Rather, we speak the truth because 
it is incumbent upon us, it is an obligation upon us to raise our voice 
for the sake of Allah, to command good, forbid evil, call for the sharia
 and khilafa.

‘And similarly, Sheikh Abu Imran – he did the same thing in Belgium and there will be others that come and will continue.

‘But if you persecute the Muslims, if
 you oppress the Muslims, then of course there will be a backlash and 
the people will revolt, and Allah knows that the consequences could be 
for Belgium and their own government.

‘So we say to you: treat the Muslims 
with respect and with dignity and do not oppress them and allow them to 
express their own belief and call for their own belief of Islam, 
otherwise we do not want to engage in confrontation with anyone.’

He went on: ‘Do not challenge the 
Muslims and do not oppress them and do not arrest them and do not arrest
 the leaders and violate their honour because this is not a good path to
 tread whether for the Belgium people or indeed the Muslims’

Fallen hero: Father Lee Rigby, 25, from Manchester, was described as 'cheeky and humorous' in tributes. He was executed by two suspected Islamic terrorists in Woolwich last week

In his video, Aziz went as far as to 
warn that Belgium will be ‘destroyed’ by Muslims and appeared to warn of
 violence and terror attacks if a fellow militant preacher remains 
imprisoned there.

His rant has been removed by YouTube for violating the company’s policy about videos that incite violence.

Sharia4Belgium is one of several 
groups to spring up in Europe and elsewhere after Choudary established 
Islam 4 UK, which was banned under anti-terrorism legislation in January
 2010.

Known online as ‘Abu Abdullah 
al-Britani’, Choudary’s colleague Abu Aziz was part of a 40-strong gang 
that hurled abuse at troops and set fire to a giant poppy during 
Armistice Day commemorations near the Royal Albert Hall in London in 
November 2010.

A spokesman for Belgium’s federal 
prosecution service told the Daily Mail: ‘This is a difficult legal 
situation. We have freedom of speech to consider and for the time being a
 prosecution is not in order.

‘These are smart people. The threats 
they are making are vague and under the anti-terror law at present only a
 direct threat of action would justify us launching a legal process 
against them.’
