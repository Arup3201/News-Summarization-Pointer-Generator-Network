The remains of the oldest European fort in North America have been unearthed by a team of archaeologists from the University of Michigan.

The remnants of the building, which was constructed by Spanish would-be colonists, were discovered in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains - a sub range of the Appalachians.

Named Fort San Juan, it was destroyed less than 18 months after it was built, but is historically significant because it marks the end of Spanish attempts to colonise North America - clearing the way for the British.

Buried: Although the settlement of Cuenca was discovered in 2004, the fort has proved elusive until now

Protection: The V-shaped Spanish moat was a key part of the fort's defences but couldn't save it in the end

Built by Spanish Captain Juan Pardo in 1567, the fort pre-dates Sir Walter Raleigh's doomed colony at Roanoke by almost 20 years, while the Jamestown settlement, which marked the start of the British domination of North America, wasn't built for another four decades.

Almost 300 miles from the Atlantic 
coast, the fort was occupied for just 18 months before it was destroyed 
by Native American Cherokee tribesmen and all but one of the 120 
soldiers in the garrison killed.

The settlement protected by the 
forts, Cuenca, was also destroyed by the Cherokee - ending Spanish 
colonial ambitions in North America in the process.

Although remains of some of the Cuenca homes had previously been discovered, the fort itself had proved elusive until now.

'We have known for more than a decade
 where the Spanish soldiers were living,' revealed Christopher Rodning, an archaeologist from Tulane University.

'This summer we were trying to 
learn more about the Mississippian mound at Berry, one that was built by
 the people of Joara [a Native American settlement], and instead we discovered part of the fort. For 
all of us, it was an incredible moment.'

Using a combination of large-scale excavations and magnetrometry, which produces X-ray like images of the site, scientists were able to pinpoint sections of the fort, including the moat and a gravelled surface that is likely to have been the entrance to the fort.

The searchers also discovered Spanish majolica pottery and other artifacts including iron nails and a hook thought to have been used to button doublets.

The Spanish garrison are thought to have been searching for gold in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains with - they thought - the blessing of local tribespeople.

'The soldiers believed that when their gifts were accepted, it meant that the native people were their subjects,' said Robin Beck of the University of Michigan.

'But to the natives, it was simply an exchange. When the soldiers ran out of gifts, they expected the natives to keep on feeding them.

'The same thing nearly happened to [British] colonists at Jamestown,' he revealed. 'The colonists nearly starved to death during the winter of 1609 but Jamestown was in a very different situation to that of Fort San Juan and Cuenca.

'English settlers kept coming but when Fort San Juan fell, it was gone for good.'

Archaeologist David Moore, of Warren Wilson College, added: 'The events at Fort San Juan represent a microcosm of the colonial experience across the continent.

'Spain's failure created an opening that England exploited at Jamestown, when America's familiar frontier narrative begins.

'For Native Americans, though, this was the beginning of a long-term and often tragic reshaping of their precolonial world.'
