A 32-year-old former police officer resigned from the Phoenix police department as he was being arrested for having sex with a 17-year-old girl Friday.

Justin LaClere, 32, is accused of having sex with the teenager, whom he met through the social media app Whisper.

According to the Scottsdale Police Department, LaClere responded to a post the girl made on January 13 of a picture of a baby with the text, 'I want to get pregnant but I'm only a teen.'

Quitter: Justin LaClere handed in his badge when he was arrested for having sex with an underage girl he met through an app

Whisper is an app that enables users to anonymously post pictures with words, usually confessional revelations and secrets.

According to Arizona Central, a person with the username 'Jason69er' wrote to the girl asking how old she was. She told him that she was 17 and the pair continued to communicate via private message over several days.

The teenager also asked how old 'Jason69er' was, and he told her he was 32, asking if that was OK.

The girl wrote, 'IDK (I don't know) I'd be worried my dad would call the cops and have you arrested for sleeping with a minor since I'm not of legal age to sleep with you.'

In a message to the girl on Monday, 'Jason69er' told the girl he'd 'always wanted a young pregnant girlfriend.'

The pair exchanged numerous photographs, including one of LaClere clearly wearing his police uniform.

On January 14, the girl was on the school bus when she received a message from Jason69er asking her if she could meet him for sex.

She agreed and the two met at the teenager's home after school while her family was away.

Police confirmed LaClere handed in his badge from the Scottsdale police on Friday after seven years on the job.

According to Rate My Cop, a police officer rating website, Justin LaClere was not popular among those who enountered him.

'I am positive that Phx Police Officer Justin Laclere must get 100's of complaints filed against him for his very unprofessional behaviors and comments... He is Grossly Incompetent. EMBARRASSMENT to The Dept!!' wrote one.'This cop completely misused his authority when I was pulled over by him. He didn't have any probable cause to search my person or vehicle. He didn't read me my rights till way after he had arrested me and questioned me for over an hour and only did so because he was on a tape recorder. He also falsly (sic) accused me of a DUI with drugs or metabolites,' claimed another.

LaClere has been charged with luring a minor and sexual relations with a minor.
