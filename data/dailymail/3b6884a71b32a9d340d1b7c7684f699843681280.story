The spies will wear disguises while giving evidence at the trial of Abid Naseer, who is accused of being behind a failed plot to bomb two Manchester shopping centres

A British spy has given evidence to a New York court wearing a long wig, a fake goatee and glasses as the case against a British man accused of being part of an international terror network.

The MI5 officer was the first of six to testify at the US trial of Abid Naseer, who is accused of being involved in an international conspiracy, targeting Manchester and New York.

All have been given permission to don disguises - including wigs and 'light make up' -  after prosecutors  convinced the judge that revealing their identities would 'pose a significant risk to their safety'.

The agents testimonies are a key part of the prosecution case, as they were part of an undercover team which conducted surveillance on Naseer, 28, while investigating a failed plot to bomb Manchester's Arndale shopping centre in 2009.

The Telegraph reports the agent - identified only as by his serial number 1603 - had donned a fake goatee beard, spectacles and a long, black wig for his appearance in the pre-recorded video.

He told the court the team had trailed Naseer for five weeks, and he had watched him buy hair dye and followed him to Liverpool on once occasion.

'I observed him looking at a video on his phone too. It had the Twin Towers and on that video an aircraft went into the second tower,' the spy told the court. 

Disguised: The British spy, who tailed Naseer, gave evidence by video at his trial - which earlier heard from Najibullah Zazi, who has admitted his part in the international plot (pictured, with Naseer in the front)

Prosecutors have alleged Naseer, 28, led the Manchester cell of a three-pronged Al Qaeda plot in 2009 to ‘repeat the devastation of 9/11’.

As well as blowing up the Arndale Centre, the terror group planned to set off bombs in the New York subway and at the offices of a Copenhagen newspaper that had published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed, the court heard earlier. 

The trial was told Naseer, who was extradited to the US two years ago, was sent to the UK from Pakistan in 2008 with co-conspirators to ‘become westerners’, manufacture explosives and plant them at a target that would ‘bomb hundreds of innocent people and cause millions of dollars of damage’. 

The court heard Naseer followed the terror training he received in Pakistan, communicating with his Al Qaeda handler by using the email names of women.

He also used code, using women’s names for the types of explosive he was considering and referring to the actual bomb attack as a ‘marriage’ or ‘wedding’, said prosecutors. 

Not guilty: Naseer has repeatedly protested his innocence, claiming he was just searching for a wife

But Naseer - a Pakistani national who came to the UK on a student visa - denies he was part of the alleged conspiracy.

He said that the time he spent on the Internet on sites like Qiran.com was part of his quest to find a woman to marry.

He claims he only wrote about women because he was pursuing a bride and was planning an actual wedding. 

'The evidence at trial will not show the defendant is an Al Qaeda member. ... He has no extremist or jihadist views,' Naseer said, referring to himself in the third person. 

The trial continues.
