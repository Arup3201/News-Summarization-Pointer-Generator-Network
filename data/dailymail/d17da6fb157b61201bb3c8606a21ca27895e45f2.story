There is growing concern for students after 'pass-out pages' glorifying excessive drinking have been springing up on social media.

Hundreds of pictures of students, some reportedly under 18 years old, are being posted on Twitter of young people who appear to be unconscious after partying.Â 

The 'pass-out pages' have proliferated showing male and female students across the country in various catatonic poses including with their heads in toilets, under tables and even in the snow.

Hundreds of concerning images of students who appear to be intoxicated have been posted on Twitter to 'pass out pages'

The images, which have been posted by students at colleges across the U.S., show some passed out in bathrooms, at a bar and even in the snow

There is growing concern over the pictures of apparently inebriated students which some see as a 'badge of honor'

Students at schools across the U.S. have been posting prolifically to the 'passed-out' pages which have sprung up on Twitter

Many of the students who appeared in pictures in this dangerous trend appear to have passed out in public places

Comments range from 'looks pretty comfy' to 'man down' and 'It's 11:30 and she's on the floor' at schools including, but not exclusively, Winona State, MSU and North Carolina.

Holly Steffl, a junior at Minnesota State University told KARE 11: 'It was really alarming and I thought people should know this is out there.'

However other students shrugged off the problem. Drew Warch, a senior at North Carolina State, has posted plenty of pictures of his drunk friends online.

He told NBC: 'I think it's funny. Some people get mad because they look dumb on the Internet, some people take it as a badge of honor that they drank a bunch of alcohol and didn't die.'

Twitter would not comment on individual accounts to MailOnline today but their official rules state the company does not 'actively monitor and will not censor user content' except when it comes to abuse or pornography.

However Twitter does offer some advice for users: 'Remember that once you've posted something on the Internet, it's highly 
unlikely you can delete or remove it before someone else sees it.'

According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, one in six U.S. adults binge drinks four times a month, consuming eight or more drinks in one sitting.

Binging is most common among young adults while nine out of ten people under the age of 21 who consume alcohol will binge drink.

Although many pictures are intended for comic effect, health professionals have outlined the long-term problems associated with binge-drinking
