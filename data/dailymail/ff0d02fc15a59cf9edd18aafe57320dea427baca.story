This video shows the moment two brothers who brutally murdered a newsagent were arrested, with one asking police officers: 'I've been arrested for murder? This is a joke.' 

Samuel, 25, and Jonathan McKinley, 23, robbed and horrifically beat 35-year-old father Choudhry Zishan to death while he was on his way to work.

The drunken thugs launched the attack on Mr Zishan and demanded his money before savagely beating him, ramming his head into a parked car.

Today, a day after they were found guilty of murder, police videos show the McKinleys' apparent confusion at being told they were being arrested on suspicion of killing the 'family man'.

A video shows the moment two brothers who brutally murdered a newsagent were arrested, with one asking police officers: 'I've been arrested for murder? This is a joke'

During Samuel McKinley's (pictured) arrest, he said: 'Can I explain what happened here or not? I just don't know what I'm arrested for'

Witnesses who heard the attack in Eastleigh, Hampshire, called police and described how the father-of-one was crying in pain as the brothers continued their violent attack.

Mr Zishan, who had a five-year-old son and a baby on the way with his pregnant wife, could not be saved and died from extensive brain injuries.

The brothers, from Eastleigh, were convicted of murder yesterday at Winchester Crown Court and could be jailed for life tomorrow. 

Several hours after the attack in the early hours of Sunday, March 30, police arrested both McKinleys on suspicion of murder and filmed the arrest with covert cameras.

When arrested, Jonathan was secretly recorded saying, 'What?!  'Are you f****** stupid?! Are you actually being stupid?! Nah, come on, seriously. Nah, be serious.'

During Samuel's arrest, he said: 'Can I explain what happened here or not? I just don't know what I'm arrested for.

'I've been arrested for murder? This is a joke.'

Three calls from witnesses to the police describing their accounts of the attack have also been released.

One caller said: 'There are three youths outside my house. Two of them seem to be beating another one up, demanding money off him.

'One of them is yelling "Give me your money. Give me your money." And one said "It's okay, I've got him in a headlock." And they seem to be crashing into cars and things.'

Another said: 'I think that someone's been mugged or attacked. I can see someone on the floor, and someone's saying "Give me the money now". Someone else was saying "I will stab you if you don't give me the money."'

A witness added: 'There's a savage attack going on. They're battering him. They're hitting cars, going behind vans. They're chucking him around. You can hear it.'

Detective Superintendent Paul Barton, of Hampshire Police, said: 'There are agencies that can try and help people but some people are beyond help unfortunately. I suspect the McKinleys are in that situation.

'Choudhry Zishan was a family man and a businessman who was well known and liked within the community in Eastleigh.

'He'd been walking to work on the morning of Sunday, March 30, when he was approached by the McKinley brothers who tried to rob him.

'They'd been drinking throughout the night and things escalated quickly to the point where they threatened him and began beating him.

'It was a senseless, brutal and sustained assault that Mr Zishan did not survive.

'The brothers used some of the money they stole from him to buy more alcohol from a nearby garage.

'Later, when they realised what they'd done, they tried to dispose of the evidence by washing their clothes.

'Our thoughts are with Mr Zishan's family.'
