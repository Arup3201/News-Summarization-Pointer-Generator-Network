A cruel couple who were captured on tape forcing two little children aged under eight to have an armed fight have been jailed.

Ian Barclay, 20, and Gemma Mattinson, 26, made the boy and girl brawl then laughed and cheered as the youngsters cried in pain and through fear.

The shocking incident was captured on a mobile phone at a house in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, and showed the girl, wearing a pink dress, being ordered to kick, punch and hit the boy with a broom, which is much bigger than her.

Jailed: Ian Barclay and Jemma Mattinson made the boy and girl, aged under eight, brawl as they laughed and cheered. Several people left the court as the video of the fight was played to the jury

Both children could be heard sobbing as the boy tried to hide behind a sofa but was dragged across the floor and banged into a radiator by Barclay.

Several distressed people left the public gallery at Newcastle Crown Court in tears yesterday as the three-minute film was played.

Prosecutor Glenda Turnbull told the court: 'The defendants encouraged the children to fight each other.

'They were both instructing the girl how to attack the boy, telling her what to do, bringing the children together, providing her with plastic sticks and a broom to use against him.

'The video footage is distressing, the children are crying.'

Miss Turnbull said it is unclear what injuries the children suffered.

Barclay can be heard shouting 'punch him, kick him, nut him' on the tape and the girl is given sticks and a broom to use as a weapons.

When the children tried to separate they were pushed back together and goaded into fighting more, despite them screaming in terror.

The pair were arrested when the person who taped the cruelty showed the footage to a relative of one of the children.

Mattinson, from Gateshead, told police she didn’t realise what went on was 'quite as bad' until she saw the footage.

Barclay, from Gateshead, said it was a 'joke that had gone too far'.

Both of them admitted child cruelty charges and have previous convictions for violence, though not against children.

Judge Roger Thorn jailed them both for eight months each.

He said: 'You put them up to fight each other as though they were toys in some Roman Amphitheatre for the sport of those watching.

'What happens beggars belief. There would be public outrage if this was not met with an immediate custodial sentence.'

Judge Thorn said the footage caused 'revulsion' to decent minded people who had viewed it and said even he could not put into words what he had seen.

The judge said: 'Words would fail to describe it. The distress of both children was apparent from watching that DVD.'

The court heard Barclay’s family have disowned him because of what he did. Mattinson gave birth to a child on Saturday which has since been taken off her.

Speaking after the hearing, the father of one of the children said he was outraged by the sentences.

He said: 'The judge said he had to follow guidelines in relation to length of the sentences and I accept that but i think its time these guidelines were reviewed.

'To do what they did is just beyond belief. I couldn’t watch the video, I had to run out of court when it was played.

'My child went through all this and those two seemed to think it was funny.

'There should be some sort of register they have to sign so everybody knows what they have done and they dont get the chance to be near any children in future.'
