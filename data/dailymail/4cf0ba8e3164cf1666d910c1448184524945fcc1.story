Forget coach-speak about technique and the biomechanics of bowling. The best piece of advice Liam Plunkett ever received was a typically blunt message from Geoff Boycott when he joined Yorkshire less than two years ago.

‘I met him when I first signed and he just said ‘don’t think, just bowl’ and walked off,’ said the Durham man whose career was reborn at Headingley. ‘That’s all he said to me and I haven’t spoken to him since. But it makes sense when I think about it now. I bowl best when I don’t think too much about it.’

Plunkett, now 29, had plenty of time to think about a career that had promised far more than it had delivered before he was called up for his 10th Test last week seven years after his ninth and what seemed final game at the highest level.

His future in the county game, let 
alone at international level, was in jeopardy when his bowling slipped 
so far that he could barely make the Durham team and sought his release 
in 2012 to start all over again at Headingley.

Under
 Yorkshire’s Australian coach Jason Gillespie, who elaborated on 
Boycott’s simple message and gave Plunkett his head, he has become the 
90 mph plus bowler England hope can be their answer to Mitchell Johnson.

Now, after impressing in 
the first Investec Test at Lord’s more than his two wickets on a pitch 
that could not have suited him less would suggest, he will take on Sri 
Lanka on his home ground tomorrow eager to take his belated chance.

‘To
 play in that first Test was massive for me,’ said Plunkett. ‘I was 
young when I first played for England and I didn’t know my game too 
well. I would turn up day after day just hoping for the best but I’ve 
got clarity in my role now.

‘I
 didn’t really know what kind of bowler I was back then. Was I a pitch 
it and up and swing it bowler? A seamer? But I know what I am now. I run
 in and hit the pitch hard and back myself to do that.

‘On
 different days different things will be needed but I can’t imagine 
England have brought me in to be an 80 mph swinger. They’ve brought me 
in to bowl quick and be aggressive. I love that role for Yorkshire and 
if that’s what England want me to do then I’m more than happy to do it.’

Say what you mean! Geoff Boycott's (R) advice to Liam Plunkett was simply, 'Don't think, just bowl!'

So what went wrong last 
time, when Duncan Fletcher called up a raw but quick Durham bowler who 
then, so the theory goes, was messed up by too much technical advice and
 tinkering with his basic action? Were the coaches culpable?

‘Different
 coaches told me different things and when you’re a youngster you’re 
like a sponge and take a lot of things in,’ said Plunkett. ‘I think you 
learn when you’re older to filter stuff. If it’s good advice you can 
keep it and take it with you but if it’s not you can say no thanks.

‘I
 can blame others but I went to people saying ‘what am I doing wrong?’ 
and ‘what do I need to work on?’ So I have to blame myself as well but 
when you take a lot in it all becomes a bit too much.

‘Each
 day I would turn up and try to do something different. I’d work on my 
front arm one day and my back leg the next so that if I performed well I
 didn’t know where it came from. I’d just go back to training not sure 
what I was doing. Now I’m a bit older and a bit smarter and I do 
appreciate what I’ve been through. I appreciate being here with England a
 lot more now than I did then.’

It
 was the short move from Durham to Yorkshire for a Middlesbrough boy who
 could have joined either as a teenager that proved the key to his 
second coming. ‘I would have loved to have played more for England, 
maybe  approaching my 100th Test like Ian Bell, but it wasn’t meant to 
be and that’s my fault,’ he said. ‘There were things that I did outside 
of cricket (Plunkett has twice been banned for drink driving). I wasn’t 
consistent enough in my training.

‘There
 have been ups and downs, but coming to Yorkshire was the best thing I 
could ever have done. I had a year left on my contract at Durham but I 
wanted to move because, it’s like any job, you can feel a bit stale. I’d
 fallen out of love with cricket really but I’m playing for fun again 
now and as soon as I did that the results started coming.’

Matured: Liam Plunkett claims he is 'older and smarter' than when he last played Test cricket in 2007

The most 
important spectator at Headingley tomorrow for Plunkett is his father 
Alan, who will be travelling down from Middlesbrough for the occasion. 
Seven years ago Plunkett senior turned down his son’s offer of a kidney 
when he became ill because he was worried how it would affect his 
cricket. Now fully recovered he is just back in time from a holiday in 
Cyprus to see his son play.

‘Dad
 didn’t take my kidney because he wanted to me to play for England,’ 
added Plunkett. ‘He was on dialysis for quite a few years and that can 
be tedious. Eventually a new kidney came up and he’s fine now. He’s been
 on holiday and he’s healthy. He said to me the other day ‘I honestly 
thought you’d never play for England again but you’ve proved me wrong.’ 
I’m upset he didn’t back me….’

The
 last line is said with the smile of a man who has found contentment 
after going round the block a few times in county cricket and in life. 
It would be a big surprise if Liam Plunkett is not a success with 
England this time.
