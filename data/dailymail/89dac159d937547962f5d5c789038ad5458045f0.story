Oscar-winning actor Jeremy Irons was today embroiled in an extraordinary row after he suggested that same sex marriage could lead to fathers marrying their own sons to avoid inheritance tax.

In an interview with the Huffington Post, Mr Irons made a series of highly inflammatory statements and even denied that such a union would be viewed as incestuous as 'men don't breed.'

He also told host Josh Zepps that he was not happy about using the word marriage for same-sex unions.

'I worry that it means somehow we debase, or we change, what marriage is. I just worry about that,' he said.

Irons' comments were savaged by activists. A spokesman from Stonewall, a gay 
rights charity, told The Independent: 'Few people will agree with Jeremy
Irons’ bizarre "concerns" about equal marriage.'

The 64-year-old actor has become prone to increasingly outspoken statements - he was recently criticised for suggesting that women were wrong to complain about being sexually harassed.

The latest controversy came during a conversation with Mr Zepps on HuffPost Live, the website's online television channel.

When asked his opinion about the ongoing debates in the U.S. and Britain over whether or not to legalise gay marriage, the actor pointed out that the UK already had civil partnerships for homosexual couples.

'It seems to me that now they're fighting for the name,' Mr Irons said. 'I worry that it means somehow we debase, or we change, what marriage is. I just worry about that.'

He went on to suggest that the 
legalisation of gay marriage could lead to unexpected consequences, 
raising the possibility that family members could marry to avoid 
inheritance tax, and asked: 'Could a father not marry his son?'

Mr Zepps pointed out that incest laws 
would prevent that possibility but Irons, who plays the Pope in The Borgias, replied: 'It's not 
incest between men, because incest is there to protect us from 
inbreeding, but men don't breed, so incest wouldn't cover that.'

Mr Irons insisted he was not motivated
by bigotry, saying: 'I don't have a strong feeling either way - I just 
wish everbody who's living with one other person the best of luck in the
world, because it's fantastic.'

In another potentially controversial 
comment, he added: 'Living with another animal, whether it be a husband 
or a dog, is great.'

Marriage debate: Jeremy Irons, pictured with his wife Sinead Cusack, said he worried that marriage was being 'debased'

Feminist news website Jezebel denounced Mr Irons' comments as 'completely gross' and urged him to 'shut up'.

Many Twitter users also expressed 
disappointment in the former star of Brideshead Revisited and The Lion 
King - @LilEsBella wrote: 'Jeremy Irons just made me sick to my stomach.
Disgusting logic.'

The actor's wife and children are 
Roman Catholic, and although he is not an active member of the church he
has described himself as a 'spiritual person'.

Mr Irons and his wife of 34 years 
Sinead Cusack were once large donors to Labour, but he has since 
expressed disappointment in the party and espoused Conservative causes 
such as smaller government and the legalisation of fox-hunting.

It is just two months since Mr Irons hit the headlines with  an interview in the Radio 
Times in which he said 'any woman worth her salt can deal with' being 
patted on the bottom.

He later claimed
his remarks were 'misquoted', but he still maintained: 'I love 
touching. I always touch people'.

He
said that a hands-on approach was not a problem because 'any 
self-respecting woman would tell you to f*** off [if she minded].'

He
also caused outrage when he compared smokers to disabled people, saying
that bans on smoking indoors were 'a terrible bullying of a minority 
that cannot speak back'.

The former star of Die Hard with a Vengeance went on to say that smokers should be given the same protection as 'handicapped people and children'.
