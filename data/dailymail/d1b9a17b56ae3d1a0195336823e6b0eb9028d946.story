 A collaboration between the founders of Frasca Food and Wine in Colorado and Chipotle Mexican Grill may change the way the Denver experiences pizza.

The founders of Frasca, Lachlan Mackinnon-Patterson and Bobby Stuckey, and Chipotle founder Steve Ells opened a restaurant in Denver in May called Pizzeria Locale that would create a fast food pizza restaurant with the same quality ingredients as other establishments but at half the price.

They worked engineers to create a cutting edge pizza oven powered by gas and infrared that makes pizza in just two minutes.They plan to open two more locations in Denver soon.

Steve Ells opened Chipotle 20 years ago and now has thousands of busy locations around the world

Mackinnon-Patterson and Stuckey opened their first Pizzeria Locale in Boulder, Colorado in 2011 which took a more classic approach to pizza making. They even sent their team to Italy before opening the pizza spot. Their other restaurant Frasca Food and Wine is fine dining and may seem like a far cry from Chipotle, which is known as being a quality yet inexpensive fast food chain. The business partners happen to see more similarities between their restaurants than differences.

Westword.com reported that Steve Ells opened Chipotle Mexican Grill at 1644 East Evans Avenue 20 years ago and now has thousands of Chipotles around the world. Ells, who is good friends with Patterson and Stuckey says, 'we've always talked about the possibility of some kind of collaboration.'

Ells told Westword that, 'The combination of the two businesses working together is a very lethal combination.'

The partners realized that Combining Chipotle's skills of feeding many people with Mackinnon-Patterson's and Stuckey's knowledge of fine dining could create a casual and fine dining dining fusion.

'We realized we could change the ways people think about pizza...how can we serve the same ingredients at less than half the price. Shockingly, it's worked,' he said to Westword.

'Opening Pizzeria Locale using a model similar to Chipotle allows us to make extraordinary pizza, made with high-quality ingredients accessible to everyone,' he continued. 

Pizzeria Locale uses high quality ingredients but only charges half the price of other similar establishments

Chipotle also uses high quality ingredients at an affordable cost

Two years ago when Chipotle partnered up with Stuckey and Patterson, they had kept it a secret. Now the secret is no more.

'For me it's kind of been a pain in the tush,' said Stuckey of the secret partnership.

'We have this business in Boulder that's just us, with no investors, and you have this situation which is the whole other end of the spectrum -- and not to be in a position to discuss that was uncomfortable. I'm glad we can now.'

'Chipotle and Frasca have much more in common than they do apart, said Mackinnon-Patterson. 'They really care about the customer, about ingredients, about service. They don't want to compromise, and they don't.'

Gretchen Kurtz reviewed Pizzeria Locale for Westword in September and wrote it's, 'Pizzeria Locale, Steve Ells-style, where you order at the counter and watch a line of white-shirted, red-hatted employees spoon toppings from metal containers onto dough that's loaded onto the spinning oven floor.'

She also said, 'The concept behind Denver's Pizzeria Locale sure has its strong points.How far can Patterson, Stuckey and crew take it? God only knows.'

'We've come a long way in a short time,' said Mackinnon-Patterson. 'We feel we can look at something more.'

The partners say that their new locations will be based on the original Denver Pizzeria Locale but that they will keep working on their efficiency.

'We're going to continue to work on it, keep improving it,' said Mackinnon-Patterson.

'The full-service restaurant is a contemporary pizzeria inspired by the traditional pizzerias of Naples, Italy. The new Denver restaurant draws from the same inspiration. It also draws from a commitment to premium ingredients and an interactive service format similar to Chipotle, ' reads Chipotle's press release.

The Detroit Free Press reported that this is not the first time Chipotle has ventured outside of Mexican Food. They also run six ShopHouse Southeast Asian Kitchen restaurants in Washington and Los Angeles.
