An electronic cigarette that exploded while charging in a car has prompted fresh safety fears over the product.

Carer Kim Taylor, 54, left the device on charge for just ten minutes before she noticed flames and thick black smoke billowing from the vehicle.

No one was inside at the time, but the back seat was completely melted and the mother-of-two was horrified at the thought she and her family could have been injured.

Safety fear: Kim Taylor and her son Jake, 11, had to extinguish a fire in her car after an e-cigarette exploded

‘I’ve gone to sleep with it plugged in
 before,’ she said. ‘I hate to think what would have happened if it had 
exploded next to me.’

The 
battery-powered product is billed as a healthy alternative to real 
cigarettes as users inhale nicotine with no tar, tobacco or carbon 
monoxide.

But there have 
been several cases of the device exploding while on charge and it is 
thought to have claimed its first victim in November last year.

Fire
 chiefs said the blaze that killed 68-year-old Evelyn Raywood was 
started by an e-cigarette battery pack left charging at her care home in
 Chesterfield, Derbyshire.

Dangerous: Miss Taylor said the explosion and resulting fire filled the car with foul-smelling smoke

Miss
 Taylor, from Leicester, had put her e-cigarette on charge in an 
auxiliary socket in the back of her Ford Mondeo during a short drive.

When she arrived home she left it there for a further ten minutes – and 
it was only when she returned to the vehicle by chance that she realised
 it was on fire.

With her 
son Jake, 11, she threw water on the blaze but the e-cigarette had 
already ‘exploded into bits and melted into the carpet’.

The e-cigarette and charger were made by Prestige Vaping but the car adapter plug was bought elsewhere.

Yasin
 Patel, director of Prestige Vaping, said it had sold thousands of the 
same starter pack Miss Taylor bought – and this was the first time a 
problem had occurred.

'If the appropriate charger was used we would take further action'

He 
said the firm sold car adapters that must be used with the device, as 
stated in the user manual, adding: ‘If the appropriate charger was used 
we would take further action.’

Miss Taylor, who also has a daughter aged 26, claims neither the e-cigarette nor charger came with a manual.

Philip
 Le Shirley, from the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, 
said: 'It is important not to leave e-cigarettes to charge unattended.'

The latest incident comes just a week after fire crews investigating a fire in East London said they believe the blaze was started by an e-cigarette on charge.

More than 20 firefighters tackled the fire in a ground floor flat in Barking and rescued a woman, who was taken to hospital with smoke inhalation and shock.

Fire chiefs investigating the incident said they believe an e-cigarette could have overheated while it was plugged into a mains socket.

Earlier this month, a pensioner was engulfed in flames on a ward at the Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester in another incident.

It is believed 65-year-old Jean Booth used an e-cigarette while she was on oxygen in her hospital bed and was left badly burned.

Just two weeks earlier, an e-cigarette exploded in a barmaid's face while it was being charged near the bar of a pub in Richmond, North Yorkshire.

Laura Baty, 18, managed to quickly turn away from the flames  - but was left with a burnt dress and a injured arm.

Following the spate of incidents, fire investigator Charlie Pugsley said: 'People assume e-cigarettes are much safer than ordinary cigarettes, and in most cases they are.

'The danger is that people sometimes use incorrect chargers which runs the risk of over-charging, which can potentially have explosive results.'
