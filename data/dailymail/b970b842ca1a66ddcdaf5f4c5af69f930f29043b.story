As far as marriage proposals go, this may not be everyone's cup of tea.

But Simon Stratton, 32, got down on one knee while snorkelling with his partner in a bog.

And despite the mud, his girlfriend Elinor Robson, 33, pulled off her snorkel and said yes.

The couple were competing in the annual World Bog Snorkelling Championships  in Mid Wales.

They were wearing full wetsuits when Mr Stratton popped the question. He said to Miss Robson: 'I'm bogging you to be my wife.'

The Groom-to-be said: 'I know a muddy bog isn't everyone's idea of romance but I knew she'd say yes.

'We often go bog snorkelling together and it’s a big part of our lives. I couldn’t think of anywhere better to ask her.'

Miss Robson added: 'I was so surprised, I never thought that when I got engaged it would be in a bog.

'Afterwards we went for a nice meal to celebrate - but only once we’d had a good wash.'

The couple, from Cardiff, each took home a bronze medal after completing two lengths of the 180ft trench at the championships in Llanwrtyd Wells in Powys.

They brave the bog every year alongside hundreds of other competitors in what has become an iconic fixture on the alternative sporting calendar.

The championship has been going strong for two decades and is part of the World Alternative Games - a fortnight celebration of bizarre sports.
