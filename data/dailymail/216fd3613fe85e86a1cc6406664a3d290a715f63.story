The chairman of the Housing Authority in Newington, Connecticut has implemented a new no smoking policy for adult residents similar to those implemented in many college dormitories.

Only difference is those impacted by the new rule aren't 18-year-old co-eds - in one case, it's a 90-year-old World War II veteran who has been told he and his 90-year-old wife who has severe Alzheimer's Disease are being evicted from the apartment where they've lived for 20 years because he has been busted smoking cigarettes on a breezeway rather than in a designated picnic area away from the building.

Andy Nowicki, who won a Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts during the war, was a combat infantryman fighting the Nazis in Africa, Italy, France and Germany. The Army is where he picked up his smoking habit 70 years ago, as Uncle Sam provided soldiers with free cigarettes during the war.

Habit: Nowicki started smoking while fighting the Nazis. He says he's tried to quit but can't

Now that habit has cost him his home.

'It's like they're going to turn this into a concentration camp,' Nowicki told the Hartford Courant as he smoked a cigarette in his rolling chair that he had to wheel the appropriate distance from his apartment in a senior living center in Cedar Village. 'I don't know why they singled me out.'

Janet Nowicki, Mr. Nowicki's daughter, has no idea where her parents will go if they are forced from their $714-a-month apartment - the couple lives on a small, fixed income. Additionally, Mr. Nowicki's wife, Leona, is in the very late stages of Alzheimer's - most of the time, she barely even recognizes her husband of nearly 70 years.

Ms. Nowicki and Paul Doyle - a state senator who is acting as the Nowicki's attorney free of charge - are urging the Housing Authority to make an exception in Mr. Nowicki's case because of his age, immobility and war record.

New Policy: the smoking restrictions were put in place at Cedar Village apartments in January 2012

'Personally, I couldn't sleep at night evicting a 90-year-old war hero from government-subsidized housing,' Doyle said. 'It's just totally incredible to me that we can't find an exception to the rules. I think common sense should prevail and let Mr. Nowicki live out his life because of what he did for all of us.'

The town's mayor has even stepped in, also urging the Housing Authority to come up with some sort of compromise that would allow the Nowickis to stay in their apartment. However, the town has no control over the independent Housing Authority.

'I fully agree that you shouldn't smoke,' Newington Mayor Stephen Woods said, 'but the man is 90 years old. There's got to be some way to compromise so that he won't have to leave the home where he's been for 20 years. Every issue isn't black and white.'

The Housing Authority doesn't seem to want to budge, though - Chairman Stephen Karp and Executive Director Melinda Harvey say that making an exception to the rule - implemented about 18 months ago - isn't going to happen.

Compromise: State Senator Paul Doyle is acting as the Nowicki's attorney and hopes he can come to a compromise that allows the couple to stay in their home

'Once you start that, where do you end that?' Karp said. 'We made a 
decision that's in the best interests of the health and safety of the 
tenants. We really feel there isn't room for making an exception on this
particular issue.'

When asked about Mr. Nowicki's mobility issues, Harvey told the paper 'he has a walker and a scooter - he gets around the property pretty well.'

Mr. Nowicki said he's tried quitting before, but simply can't.

'Are you kidding?' he said. 'I got the best doctor in the world. He gave me gum. He gave me the patch.'

Elliot Lane is the attorney representing the Housing Authority when the Nowicki's case is heard on September 3. He said he expects a mediation session prior to the hearing.

'Can a compromise be reached?' Lane said. 'We're not in court yet. I'm looking forward to meeting with Sen. Doyle to see if we can find an agreement satisfactory to both parties.'
