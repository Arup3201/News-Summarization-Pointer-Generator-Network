Danny Cipriani is primed and ready to make his long-awaited England comeback next month.

The Sale Sharks star was pictured looking focused in training with Stuart Lancaster's side on Monday ahead of their international against the Barbarians on June 1.

While his inclusion in this squad doesn't guarantee a place on next month's tour to New Zealand, Cipriani appears to be knuckling down.

Telling them what's what! Danny Cipriani is back in the England fold ahead of the tour of New Zealand

And Lancaster doesn't see bringing him back into the hold as a risk.

‘I don’t view it as a risk,’ he said. ‘It is an opportunity. Ultimately, selection will be affected by how effective Danny is off the field in a training environment and his ability to apply his skills to our game plan.

‘If he’s good enough he’ll get the opportunity to go to New Zealand and if he’s not quite ready he’ll hopefully play in the Barbarians game (at Twickenham on June 1) as the beginning of his return to international rugby.

‘I’ve spoken to him in part (about team culture) but there will be a lot more when he comes into camp. I’ll arrange a one-on-one with every player. Danny’s might be a little bit longer. But of course he can train his way on to the plane. All the players can.’

A new man? Picking Cipriani for this squad isn't a risk according to head coach Stuart Lancaster
