Vladimir Putin today plunged Russia into permanent wintertime - just as the West accused him of bringing back the Cold War.

The Kremlin leader signed a new law which means the country will abandon an experiment of having 'summer time' all year round.

Most Russians will switch their clocks back on 26 October - but then not move them forward one hour next spring.

Dark days ahead: Russia's President Vladimir Putin chairs a Security Council meeting in Moscow as it emerged he has signed a new law scrapping an experiment of having 'summer time' all year round

His move follows criticism by his people of the 'permanent summertime' law imposed by Putin's prime minister Dmitry Medvedev in 2011 when he was president.

As one diplomat said: 'It is a fitting change right now when Putin is bringing us back to the chill of the Cold War.'

The new law also emphasises the sheer size of Russia by adding two new time zones to the map with a stroke of the president's pen.

In future, Russia will have 11 time zones between the Baltic and the Pacific instead of the current nine.

A new time zone one hour ahead of Moscow will be created for the Udmurtian Republic and Samara Region.

'Chill of the Cold War': Putin's move follows criticism by his people of the 'permanent summertime' law imposed by Putin's prime minister Dmitry Medvedev in 2011 when he was president

The 11th time zone, nine hours ahead 
of Moscow, is for the Kamchatka region and the Chukotka Autonomous Area,
 where football tycoon Roman Abramovich was once governor.Â 

Currently the time difference between Moscow and Kamchatka and Chukotka is eight hours.

Meanwhile,
 the time in the Siberian region of Kemerovo, currently three hours 
ahead of Moscow, will be moved into an existing zone four hours 
ahead of the capital.

It means the 26 October will involve some complicated changes for Russians.

Some regions will have to put the clock two hours back.

Five regions, including the republic of Udmurtia, and the Samara and Kemerovo regions, will make no switches.

Medvedev's law led to complaints by Russians of chronic fatigue and lack of sleep.
