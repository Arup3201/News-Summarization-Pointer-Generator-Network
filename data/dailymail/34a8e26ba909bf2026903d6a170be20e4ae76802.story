Cool commuters might like the idea of skateboarding to work.

But it can be difficult to balance while carrying a bag full of papers and a precious laptop and skating along busy streets.

To solve this problem, one U.S. inventor has come up with a skateboard built for business as it has a handy compartment inside its wooden body to carry all the bits and pieces needed for a day in the office.

BriefSkate: One inventor in the U.S. has come up with a skateboard built for business as it has a handy compartment inside its wooden body to carry all the bits and pieces needed for a day in the office (pictured)

The BriefSkate is currently available custom-made but its creator, Alexei Novitzy is abut to raise money on Kickstarter to build a basic version.

The skateboard has a compartment designed to hold keys, mobile phones, folders and even a small laptop.

Its compartment measures 18inches (46cm) by 7inches (18cm).

The concealed box can be accessed by lifting a lid, or the board, of the skateboard and is lined with shock absorbent foam to protect delicate items.

Custom-made versions cost from around £600 ($1,000) but the basic version that will be sold on Kickstarter will cost around £90 ($150).

Alexei Novitzky designed the skateboard to hold keys, mobile phones, folders and even a laptop.

The storage section of the 'BriefSkate' board is 18inches (46cm) long and 7inches (18cm) wide so that it can be used for carrying day-to-day items while skating along.

A layer of shock-absorbent foam lines the compartment to protect fragile belongings placed inside the box.

The skateboard looks normal until the lid is lifted up and the box is revealed, which is kept shut by two metal catches, so the contents don’t suddenly fall out.

Mr Novitzky, 29, from Florida, came up with the idea for BriefSkate while he was skateboarding from class to class at university with a rucksack on his back.

‘I used to carry a rucksack with me while I did it but I soon became tired doing that for five hours every day and I knew there had to be a solution,’ he said.

‘I thought it would be a good idea if I could put my stuff inside my skateboard and travel around that way.

He developed a prototype by fixing a wooden box to an old board and placing another on top, which he attached using a hinge.

Now, the designer is custom making longboards for clients at a cost of around £600 ($1,000) although special versions can cost much more.

Mr Novitzky said: ‘I took two old skateboards and attached one on top of the other with a hinge, and then made a compartment from a piece of wood, which became my prototype.

Mr Novitzky is planning to launch a basic version of his design called BriefSkate (pictured) on crowd funding website Kickstarter next month where he will raise money to use for the manufacturing costs. The basic version of his design is set to sell for around £90

‘It was big enough to hold essentials like my calculator, pencil, keys, and phone.

‘I started using it and when I was in a design class the person leading the course said I should get it patented, which I did.

‘I launched my company, Looshes Labs and I now make customised longboards with storage compartments for people.’

‘Although I don't think the skateboard will replace the rucksack, I think it will work great as an addition,’ Mr Novitzky added.
