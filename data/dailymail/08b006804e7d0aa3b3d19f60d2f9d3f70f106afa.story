A mother who was stabbed five times in the stomach as her cage fighter ex-boyfriend tried to kill their unborn child has told how she screamed 'he's killed the baby'.

Lauren Oliver, 26, said she dreads the day she must tell Harper, now a healthy five-month-old, how her father almost killed them both, seven months into the pregnancy.

Professional fighter Nicholas Leaning, 28, was jailed for 19 years last week for the assault on the doorstep of Miss Oliver's Scunthorpe home, with a judge describing him as a 'ticking time bomb'.

Miss Oliver told how the thug was wearing his cage fighter mask when he punched her on the head then repeatedly knifed her.

'As Nick stabbed me I just kept begging him not to kill Harper, not to kill my baby, but he just kept stabbing me,' she told the Sunday People.

'I was shouting 'Please Nick, please don't kill us.' Then he stopped. I looked up and saw he was wearing his cagefighting mask over his mouth and nose. 

'He just stared at me and I knew he was grinning because his eyes creased up. Then he stabbed me a fifth time and ran off.'

Miss Oliver said how she screamed 'he's killed the baby' after the attack on the doorstep of her home

Leaning had been cheating on Miss Oliver with his ex-girlfriend and when she told him she was pregnant the professional fighter told her to get an abortion.

He told her he would deny the child was his and would kick it out of her if she didn't get rid of it. 

But once she refused he feared he would be exposed as a cheat and launched his assault. 

He was cleared of attempted murder but convicted of wounding with intent and attempted child destruction at Hull crown court.

'How can someone do that to their own child? I can't believe Harper and I survived. Every time I hold her I think how lucky we are,' said Miss Oliver.

'The biggest comfort is knowing he's behind bars and can't touch us again. Harper will be grown by the time he gets out, but I still have to tell her what happened. How can I hide it?

'She would find out sooner or later but then how do you tell someone their own dad tried to kill them before they were even born?

'It's disgusting - he's disgusting.' 

Miss Oliver was drenched in blood after the attack, but dragged herself out of the house and screamed her help from her neighbour.  

Miss Oliver said the cage fighter was wearing his mask during the attack at her Scunthorpe home 

'I was shouting, 'He's killed the baby, Nick's killed her,' she said.

'I lifted my top up and fleshy tissue was hanging on my right side. I felt really woozy but I wanted to stay awake to know if my daughter was alive.' 

She was taken to Scunthorpe General Hospital where surgeons were waiting to  deliver her baby by caesarean section six weeks before due date.

Surgeons said Harper survived as she was in the breech position and Miss Oliver's pregnancy fat protected her from the full force of the knife.

Her mother described the moment she heard her heartbeat and realised she was alive. 

'Suddenly I heard it. Boomboom, boom. Somehow she was alive. 'I couldn't believe it. It was the sweetest sound I had ever heard.'

Harper was delivered weighing just 4lb 1oz and Lauren had 46 staples in five external and seven internal wounds. The blade nicked her uterus twice. 

Miss Oliver said nurses had to take a picture of Harper to convince her that she had survived. 

She revealed that she had been in a 'great' relationship for around two years before she discovered he had rekindled a relationship with his ex-partner Lindsay Coombs.

After she found out she was pregnant she went to see Miss Coombs for proof that they were back together.  

'We found out he had been with us both all along. I found out I was pregnant, and when I told him he told me to I had to go and get an abortion, but I didn't want to,' she told the court. 

'He said I had to get rid of it but when I wouldn't, he said he didn't want anything to do with it.' 

She now suffers panic attacks and has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress.
