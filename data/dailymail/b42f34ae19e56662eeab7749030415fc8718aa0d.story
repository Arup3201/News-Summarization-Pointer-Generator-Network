Manchester City were furious to have conceded a late penalty in their 2-2 draw with CSKA Moscow.

The result leaves their progression to the knockout stages in doubt after Bebras Natcho converted from the spot to haul the visitors level after City had opened up a 2-0 lead.

Here, Sportsmail’s GRAHAM POLL, a former Premier League and World Cup referee, delivers his verdict.

Aleksandar Kolarov was adjudged to have brought down Seydou Doumbia in the area late in the match

Joe Hart dives to his left but is unable to keep out Bibras Natcho's late, controversially awarded, penalty

Manchester City have every right to feel aggrieved at the loss of two points in Moscow as a Hungarian referee showed that he is no better than a couple of Premier League referees who gave poor penalties last weekend.

No matter how many times I watch replays of the 86th-minute challenge by Aleksandar Kolarov (left) I cannot understand why a penalty was awarded.

In the last two games City have suffered from poor penalty decisions and must be hoping that they’ll benefit from some in the near future.
