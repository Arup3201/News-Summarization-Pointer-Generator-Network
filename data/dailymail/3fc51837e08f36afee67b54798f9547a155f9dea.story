If being pooped-on from the heavens is a sign of good luck, you could say Sydney artist Emilio Cresciani has had a good run - at least when it comes to a supply of ready-made canvases.  

The artist says he became fascinated with patterns of bird droppings on city pavements after a family holiday to Venice some years ago. So he started photographing them.

'I know it's not a subject that many people would think of as art, but really, nature is the source and place of all creativity,' says Cresciani. 'Natural forms have their own beauty and it's the randomness of the patterns that inspired me.'

His collection of black-and-white images, Flight Patterns, is now on show at the MARS Gallery in Toowoomba, Queensland.

Cresciani says the images, taken in-and-around Sydney, including Hyde Park, Central Station and Manly, remind him of Jackson Pollock's  expressionist works and have even been called 'White Poles' by one fan.

'The patterns are a natural landscape, overlaid on a man-made landscape,' says Cresciani. 'It also continues my interest in waste and the things that we overlook in our everyday lives.'

'We love looking at cloud formations and the colours and shapes of sunsets so why not other aspects of nature?' says Cresciani

Cresciani says his photographs have been called 'White Poles' in reference to expressionist painter Jackson Pollock's famous 'Blue Poles'

'My parents kept telling me to look up at the sights but I became fascinated by the sites on the ground,' Cresciani says of a family holiday to Venice, a city home to millions of pigeons

Cresciani says he spent 8 months shooting bird poo all over Sydney for his 'Flight Patterns' exhibition.

'The patterns are a natural landscape, overlaid on man-made landscape,' says Cresciani of his art. 

Cresciani says it's the randomness of the designs that he finds interesting
