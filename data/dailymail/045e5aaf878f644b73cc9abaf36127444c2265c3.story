The smell of success is going on sale at Harrods as you'll have to be super rich to afford their latest perfume.

To mark the opening of the Salon de Parfum boutique at the London department store, the British perfumer Clive Christian has created a special edition of his No1 perfume with an eye-watering price tag of £143,000.

A standard bottle of the fragrance costs £450 and is marketed as 'the world's most expensive perfume'. But the one-of-a-kind new edition genuinely deserves this description thanks to the way it has been packaged.

Called the No1 Passant Guardant, it uses the perfume house's signature crystal bottle and then ups the ante by covering it in hand-crafted, 24 carat gold lattice-work. 

As with all the bottles, the top is a crown shape as the design was created in 1872 and paid homage to Queen Victoria. 

But in this case, the gold crown is embedded with flawless white diamonds. In total, there are 2,000 individually set diamonds on the bottle.

Meanwhile, the lion motif on the front is made up of two yellow diamonds, with a rare pink diamond marking out the lion's tongue. 

On his website, Clive Christian, OBE, said: 'I was inspired to create an iconic bottle as precious as a crown jewel to mark this special event.'

Harrods new venture: The expensive perfume was created to celebrate the opening of the Salon de Parfum boutique at the London department store

The extravagant bottle contains 30ml of his No1 The World's Most Expensive Perfume. 

The Salon de Parfum opened on the sixth floor of Harrods on Tuesday.

Mia Collins, head of beauty at Harrods told Luxury Daily that they wanted to 'create a serene and intimate environment for customers to take their time enjoying and learning more about scent'.

She added: 'The consumer experience is at the heart of all innovation and retail developments at Harrods. Within Salon de Parfums, we actively encourage our clients to sit down, enjoy and take their time discovering the best of what fragrance has to offer, whether this be an informal consultation or an in depth interview with a view to creating your very own, unique signature scent. The experience will be unparalleled.'
