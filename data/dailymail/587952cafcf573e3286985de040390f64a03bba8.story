Derby County manager Steve McClaren has reassured fans he won't be leaving the club amid Newcastle United's interest in him taking their vacant job. 

The former England boss is the bookmakers' favourite to succeed Alan Pardew at St James' Park but insists he still has work to do at Pride Park.

The Rams, who lost to Queens Park Rangers in heart-breaking circumstances in last season's play-off final, have been impressive all season and sit third in the Championship.

And now McClaren has echoed club chief executive Sam Rush in dismissing the Newcastle rumours.

He told the Derby Telegraph: 'Sam Rush spoke to me about three times last week and I said to him then, "look, don't worry, I am going nowhere".

'I have got a job to do here. I don't want to let people down here. You've got to show loyalty.

'Derby have given me a great opportunity. They have backed me and Sam and the owners have been fantastic.

'We have asked players to commit to long contracts to take Derby forward, and the staff as well.

'We are building here and I want to see the job through.'

Derby are currently third in the Championship and sit three points behind the leaders Bournemouth

The 53-year-old, appointed by Derby in September 2013, reaffirmed their desire to win promotion to the Premier League having missed out in the final minute of last season.

He added: 'I love it here. I don't want to let people down and there is no question of that, despite all the rumours.

'These things are going to crop up with players and with staff, and it can't derail us.

'Our objective is to push for the Premier League and we feel we are in a good position to do that.

'I don't want to let people down on that. The supporters have been fantastic with me from day one.

'There is nothing in my mind that says I am going anywhere.'

Pardew resigned last Monday to take over at Crystal Palace and John Carver took caretaker charge while the hunt for a new manager goes on.
