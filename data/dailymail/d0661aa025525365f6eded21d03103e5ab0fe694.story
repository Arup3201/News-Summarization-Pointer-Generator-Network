The death this week of press secretary James Brady, who was paralyzed during an attempted assassination against President Reagan in 1981, has been ruled a murder.

Brady, 73, had used a wheelchair since the shooting outside the Washington Hilton Hotel, and his speech was slurred.

A medical examiner ruled Friday that his death on Monday was a result of the grievous injuries he received in the attack.Â

Charges: The death on Monday of former press secretary James Brady, who was shot during an attempted assassination against President Reagan, has been ruled a homicide

Attack: This photograph from March, 1980, shows a U.S. secret service agent with an automatic weapon watching over James Brady (center and Washington DC police officer, Thomas Delahanty, left) the president's secretary, after being wounded in an attempt on the life of President Ronald Reagan in Washington

The gunman, John Hinckley Jr, is in a mental hospital after he was found not guilty of attempted assassination by reason of insanity.

However, the ruling over Brady's death opens up the possibility that a murder charge could be brought against him, NBC4 reported.

District of Columbia police spokeswoman Gwendolyn Crump said that the department was notified of the homicide ruling earlier today.

NBC justice correspondent Pete Williams said: 'We are a long way from 
knowing what the federal authorities are going to do with this.'

Any charges made against Hinckley could have an impact on efforts by his family to get permanent leave from a secure hospital granted for him.

New charges: John Hinckley Jr, pictured taking a stroll near his mother's house earlier this year, was found not guilty of attempted assassination by reason of insanity. He could now be charged with murder

A court 
had recently ruled that he could spend 17 days a month with his family 
in Virginia, but a judge warned at the time that he still 'exhibits 
deceptive behavior'.

As
 part of a carefully monitored program, the 58-year-old is allowed to 
stay on an exclusive gated estate set among the lush greens of a golf 
course near Williamsburg, Virginia.

Hinckley
 was in his 20s when he fired several shots at President Reagan outside a
 hotel on March 31, 1981, apparently in an attempt to get the attention 
of Jodie Foster.

One bullet missed the President's heart by about an inch, and he lost nearly half his body's blood supply.

Campaign: After the attack, which left Brady, pictured with his wife Sarah in 2011, paralyzed he became an advocate for gun control

Three others, including Brady who was hit in the head by a bullet, were seriously wounded.

The press secretary was left paralyzed on the left side of his body and later dedicated his life to gun control by starting the Brady Campaign which has been the most vocal campaign to outlaw assault weapons.

Police officer Thomas Delahanty and Secret Service agent Timothy McCarthy recovered from their wounds.
