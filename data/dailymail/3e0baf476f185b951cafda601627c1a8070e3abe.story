The FBI has announced a nationwide manhunt for a San Francisco man after a raid on his apartment allegedly produced a cache of explosive materials and chemicals.

Authorities have released a photo of Ryan Chamberlain, 42 - who they say is considered armed and dangerous - as part of their search, but they have not elaborated on the nature of the investigation.

Chamberlain is a self-proclaimed 'political junkie' who had worked as a music writer before switching to public relations - although one friend said he had 'got weird' after losing a job last year.

The FBI say there is a chance Chamberlain may have rigged his car - a white 2008 Nissan Altima  with Texas or California license plate numbers 7FQY085 or BX9M042 - with explosive devices.

'Armed and dangerous': Ryan Kelly Chamberlain, II, is being sought by the FBI after explosive materials were found in his San Francisco apartment during a raid. They warned that he could be dangerous until announcing Monday that he's no longer a public threat

He was last
 seen driving in south San Francisco wearing a navy hoodie and is 
described as being 6 feet 3 inches, weighing approximately 225 pounds, 
with blue eyes and brown hair.

Authorities said anyone who sees Chamberlain should call 911 rather than approach him.

'We believe he is alone in the vehicle but we just don't know, again, where his ties or his network is so we ask that any members of the public be on the lookout for anyone that matches this man's description,' FB spokesman Peter Lee said outside the FBI headquarters on Sunday.

The
 alert was issued after the FBI showed up to Chamerlain's apartment, 
located in the Russian Hill neighborhood, at 9am Saturday, with a search
 warrant.

Chamberlain did not answer the door. Authorities remained at the scene, and a hazmat team arrived to enter 
the one-bedroom apartment.

They remained on the scene well into the 
evening, returning again on Sunday.

Search: A hazmat crew searches Chamberlain's home on Saturday as part of a criminal investigation. The chemicals found in the apartment were not revealed as of Monday evening

Probe: Emergency services outside Chamberlain's apartment. Authorities were on the scene all weekend

Discovery: The back patio and sliding glass windows to Ryan Chamberlain's apartment at 1609 Jackson St in Russian Hill. The apartment remained sealed after FBI agents carried out a raid

According to ABC7,
 who was on scene throughout the day, the hazmat team extracted a 
toolbox from the apartment. Equipment such as x-rays and a bomb disposal
 robot were used.

Later in the evening, a loud bang was heard at the scene.

Despite this, authorities did not evacuate residents from the surrounding apartments.

'There is no risk to public safety,' the FBI told ABC7. 'The protective equipment that you see is for agent safety.'

Chamberlain may have bought the chemical off the Internet, the FBI told NBC Bay Area.

Residents inside of the apartment complex also told the station that FBI agents took at least two computers from Chamberlain's apartment.

More than a dozen bags of evidence were reportedly taken from the apartment.

Chamberlain was described by a neighbor as 'a quiet guy, nice enough.' 

His boss at a music rights consultancy group said he last contacted her Friday to remind her to deposit his paycheck at a new bank account.

Brooke 
Wentz said the conversation was uneventful and that she was 
'tremendously dumbfounded' that the contractor she hired to handle her 
company's social media accounts was a wanted man.

'He's a nice guy,' Wentz told The Associated Press.

She
 said it didn't seem like Chamberlain was staying in the apartment on 
Jackson Street because when she mailed him his paycheck in April, he 
told her he would have to go and collect it.

She
 said he seemed under financial pressure because he told her that two 
friends who were leasing his apartment left without telling him and he 
had to scramble to pay for two rentals.

'I
 wondered what kind of friends would do something like that? I tried to 
ask him about the situation but he was kind of evading my question,' 
Wentz said.

Alex Clemens, founder of San Francisco's Barbary Coast Consulting, told the San Francisco Chronicle that Chamberlain had worked on numerous political campaigns.

'I'm
 worried about the guy,' he said. 'I'm hoping this ends without anybody 
getting hurt. I'm flabbergasted that this seems to be taking place.'

No longer a threat: A picture of Ryan Chamberlain, a man in his 30s, found on his Twitter and Facebook pages. Chamberlain was the subject of an FBI manhunt after authorities found explosives in his home, but he's no longer considered a public threat

Wanted: Chamberlain, pictured with friends, worked as a music and sports writer before getting into PR

Questions: Another image shows him laying on top of a friend. His boss told reporters that he had said a couple of friends had just moved out of his apartment, leaving him to cover their rent

But 
acquaintances also said that Chamerlain struggled after losing his job 
at Project Sport, a marketing company where he worked with professional 
athletes, last November.

Friend Randy Bramblett

Randy
 Bramblett, a professional cyclist and personal trainer who met 
Chamberlain through his work at the company, said that he 'got weird' 
after losing his job.

'The
 thing is, there was a lot of strange behavior since November,' 
Bramblett said. 'He stopped answering his phone. I think he became an 
extreme introvert.'

He added: 'I've never seen him be violent, ever, but I would definitely say that maybe emotionally and mentally he was a little unstable.'

Authorities
 have been quiet on the exact nature of the investigation, although they
 have said that Chamberlain is wanted for possessing explosives in his 
home and that he acted alone.

But they would not say what type of explosives were found at the apartment, nor how he came into possession of it.

Chamberlain has a large social media presence, with his 'about me' page showing several different online initiatives.

Sports lover: Ryan Chamberlain had also live-tweeted football games for the San Francisco Chronicle

The FBI arrived at Chamberlain's Russian Hill apartment Saturday with a search warrant, only to find him gone

According to a biography posted on The Rights Network,
 Chamberlain began his professional career as a music reporter with the 
Des Moines Register, in Des Moines, Iowa, before moving to San Francisco
 to pursue a career as a public relations professional.

According to the biography, Chamberlain became involved working with 10 'social media properties'.

In his about.me biography, Chamberlain described himself as a 'SF political junkie and oft-times operative.'

A spokeswoman for the University of San Francisco said Chamberlain taught a 'Grass Roots Mobilization' course to graduate students in the Public Affairs program in 2011.

Anne-Marie Devine said Chamberlain taught for one semester, and wasn't invited to teach another course. She said she didn't know why because hundreds of adjunct professors come and go.

According to the FBI, Chamberlain has a criminal history containing only minor infractions.

The
 FBI has not said what they were originally looking for with the search 
warrant, and says that Chamberlain's warrant and affidavit are currently
 sealed.
