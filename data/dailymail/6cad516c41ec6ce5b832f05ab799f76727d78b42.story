Jennifer Ward, 51 (left) and Alistair Lobban, 54 (right) have been ordered to repay more than £700,000 which they pocketed through stealing gift vouchers from Asda

A supermarket accounts worker who stole £400,000 by cashing in Asda vouchers so she could enjoy a champagne lifestyle has been ordered to repay £680,000.

Jennifer Ward, 51, from York, used vouchers that she was supposed to destroy to fund a six-year crime spree, which involved frittering away money on lavish holidays, jewellery and designer clothes.

When police raided the account manager's home, they also found an Aladdin's cave of expensive electrical items, which had been bought using the money she stole from the supermarket chain.

In total, Ward pocketed £680,000 from the scam, by making investments with the money she had stolen.

Now the fraudster has been ordered to re-pay the money she made, following a court ruling under the Proceeds of Crime Act.

Her 54-year-old partner Alistair Lobban, a former soldier who also made £50,000 from the scheme, must also repay his share of the money. 

During the hearing at Leeds Crown Court, Recorder Gregory Perrins told the pair: 'After today you will hopefully understand the consequences of what you have done.'

The pair were jailed in June 2013 for a total of three years.

The court had heard how Ward worked in the cash office at the retail chain, where she was responsible for destroying used vouchers which had been spent in store. She was then supposed to reconcile the accounts. 

But Ward abused her position of trust and began to steal cash and vouchers which were under her control. She would then falsify the accounts which she sent to Asda's head office, to cover her tracks.

Police began investigating Ward after fellow Asda staff noticed her excessive spending. They also said she showed a clear 'protectiveness' in handling the in-store gift vouchers. 

Investigations soon showed that Ward and Lobban had bought a timeshare week at a holiday cottage in the Scilly Isles costing £30,000, had gone on a £4,000 Caribbean cruise and had also ran up £157,000 on Ward's Marks & Spencer card.

When their home in York was raided, police also found a room piled high with boxes of electrical items including widescreen TVs, digital cameras and DVD players and a stack of vouchers.

Gift vouchers and £30,000 worth of cash were also discovered.

Today, Financial investigator for North Yorkshire Police Paul Dowsland told the court that, after Ms Ward's crimes came to light, he combed through her accounts.

Describing how Ward earned an extra £280,000 through investments, he said: 'What struck me was the sheer volume of what had been accumulated.

'It wasn't just a case of what was going into the account, but it was mushrooming and growing. The overall balance was increasing as well.'

At the time of their sentencing in 2013, the pair were described by a judge as 'ordinary couple motivated by insatiable greed'.  

When police raided her property, they found more than £200,000 worth of Asda vouchers in her possession

As accounts manager for Asda, Jennifer Ward worked in the cash office at the retail chain.

She was responsible for reconciling accounts and destroying used vouchers, which had been spent by customers in store.

But, in 2004, Ward began to steal the vouchers which she was meant to destroy. She  also started stealing cash from the office.

Ward would then falsify the accounts which she returned to Asda's head office, to make it look as though the vouchers had not been used. 

Police started to investigate Ward's accounts after fellow Asda staff noticed her excessive spending.

They also said she showed 'protectiveness' in handling the in-store gift vouchers. 

Ward pleaded guilty to charges of theft and possessing or having control of an article for use in fraud on 13 January 2012 at York Crown Court. She got a two-year jail term.

Lobban, who denied knowing about Ward's acts but was found guilty of money laundering, was jailed for 12 months

Judge Tom Bayliss told them: 'You are pleasant people but underneath it all you are motivated by insatiable greed. 

'This was a gross breach of trust against your employer over a number of years.

'Your lifestyle was all funded by theft from an employer to whom you owed a duty of trust and a high level of responsibility.

'You were taking cash vouchers and rather than destroying them, you were stealing them and recycling them. This went on for many years.

'It may have started on a small scale but it escalated to a huge amount of money and you both enjoyed the fruits of that spending, which was funded by dishonesty. 

'You were enjoying a lifestyle unimaginable for your earnings. We have heard that you were spending money like it was going out of fashion, and you were.'

The crimes began in 2004 lasting until 2010, when Ward was arrested shortly before they embarked on a £4,000 Carribean cruise.
