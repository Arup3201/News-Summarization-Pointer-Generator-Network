They walked under a salute of sabers- the traditional closing for military weddings.

And while the marriage was not legal - banned in the state of North Carolina, where Fort Bragg is located - the symbol of a same-sex couple being afforded the same traditions as any military couple meant just as much.

Fort Bragg Maj. Daniel Toven exchanged vows with Jonathon Taylor on Saturday before 100 people at his home base, which is also one of the largest army bases in the world and headquarters of the United States Army's airborne and Special Operations Forces., according to The Fayettevile Observer.

The couple had been officially married in Washington, D.C., in August, but the second ceremony represented the 'wonderful place we're at' in the world when it comes to gay rights.

'It was my hope that someday before I retired that I might see the repeal of don’t ask, don’t tell,' Toven said.

'This? I never imagined in a million years. It’s a dream come true.'

His husband acknowledged the historic nature of their ceremony.

'We’d be lying if we said we did not think about it,' Taylor said.

'But it says a lot about the wonderful place we’re at.'

More than 100 people turned out to bless the pair's marriage, which for a same-sex couple at Fort Bragg.

Among the attendees at the Episcopal service included a one-star general and a command sergeant major.

Also attending were Lt. Col. Heather Mack and her wife, who initially was barred from membership in the Fort Bragg Officers' Spouses Club before the group relented earlier this year.

The couple says that the base’s superiors were welcoming to their ceremony long before they were ever married.

Toven works as a bandleader at Fort Bragg, while Taylor serves as a nurse at Cape Fear Valley Medical Center.

Rev. Harry Abernathy, who conducted an Episcopal ritual of blessing, said that 'the couple’s relationship was a sign of God’s love'.

About 100 relatives and friends of the couple attended, including some notable military members. Among the latter were Lt. Col.
