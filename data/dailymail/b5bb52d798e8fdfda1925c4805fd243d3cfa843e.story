Accused: Benjamin Boeteng leaving Kingston Crown court yesterday

The son of Britain’s first black Cabinet minister sexually assaulted a sleeping woman, a court heard yesterday.

Benjamin Boateng is alleged to have attacked the 23-year-old when she passed out drunk on a sofa after a night of clubbing.

The 27-year-old, whose father is Lord Boateng, is said to have climbed on top of the woman while she was ‘dead to the world’, yanking down her underwear.

A jury was told she woke in shock to find a stranger sexually assaulting her and screamed: ‘How can you do that when I was asleep?

'I don’t know who you are.’

The court heard the alleged victim and a friend started a ‘club crawl’ of the West End of London at 1am on September 19 last year and downed four vodka cocktails.

At 4am, their friend Ryan Bish invited them to drink free champagne and vodka in the VIP lounge of the Jet Black nightclub, which is owned by his father.

They moved on to a party at his riverside flat in Battersea, and Boateng turned up an hour later just before the woman passed out at 8am.

Yesterday she sobbed while giving evidence at Kingston Crown Court in South-West London.

‘I was starting to wake up and I thought it was my boyfriend,’ she said.

‘I kissed him back because I did not know what I was doing.

‘I said “Where am I?” He said “You are in Battersea, babes”. I thought “Who is that?” I got the shock of  my life.

‘I said “Who the hell are you?” My knickers had been pulled down as well. I pushed him off and I ran out.’

The woman fled the flat in tears and called the police after being violently sick four times.

When he was confronted, Boateng denied any wrongdoing.

Mr Bish’s business partner Mark Rowe, 
who was asleep on another sofa in the same room, told police he woke up 
to see the woman had been covered with a quilt and that the quilt was 
‘moving’ with Boateng beside her.

The court heard that traces of cocaine
were found on the woman’s body.

She denied taking drugs, however, telling jurors Boateng’s fingers may have had cocaine on them.

Heather Norton, prosecuting, said: ‘Mr
Boateng’s attitude was effectively, “What is the problem, we have only 
been kissing?”.’  

His father Paul, 60, was an MP for 18 
years before becoming a Cabinet minister in May 2002, when Tony Blair 
made him Chief Secretary to the Treasury.

The father of five then served as the 
British High Commissioner to South Africa from 2005 to 2009 and joined 
the House of Lords last year.

He was not in court yesterday.

His son, who lives in Marylebone, central London, and works in the entertainment industry, denies assault by penetration.

The case continues.

Paul
Boateng, 60, became the UK's first black Cabinet Minister in May 2002, 
when he was appointed as Chief Secretary to the Treasury.

He was quoted as saying: 'My colour is part of me but I do not choose to be defined by my colour.'

His
appointment was greeted with praise by civil rights activists who said 
that his appointment gave hope to young black youths and would inspire 
them to become involved in politics.

Following
his departure from the House of Commons, he served as the British High 
Commissioner to South Africa from March 2005 to May 2009.

He was introduced as a member of the House of Lords on 1 July 2010.
