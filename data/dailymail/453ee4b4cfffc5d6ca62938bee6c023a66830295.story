It turns out there’s no need for dog owners to splurge on expensive toys for their beloved pets.

For this playful puppy, all it took was an ice cube to keep him entertained.

But Rugby the bulldog can’t seem to figure out the tiny object in front of him as he encounters ice for the first time.

Now that's an ice challenge: Cautious Rugby surveys the ice cube before attacking

Cold on the nose: Rugby the bulldog can’t seem to figure out the tiny object in front of him

In an adorable moment captured on camera by his owner, cautious Rugby barks at the ice cube and then nudges it along the floor of his family’s home.

Once he feels the chill on his nose, he shakes his head in confusion and barks again. 

Moments later, Rugby pokes at the piece of ice with his paw before he attempts to pounce on it and nip at it.

The feisty pup's owner posted the clip on YouTube, where viewers' hearts have been melting while watching the cute puppy’s amusing battle.

One viewer called Rugby ‘the cutest puppy ever’.
