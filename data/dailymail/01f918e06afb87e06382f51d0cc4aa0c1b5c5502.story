Winner: Gold medal winner Laura Trott says car drivers aren't always to blame for cyclists being knocked down

In the notoriously vicious car versus cycle debate, you might expect Olympic gold medal winner Laura Trott to be firmly on the side of her fellow pedallers.

But the London 2012 star has actually hit out at rogue members of her cycling tribe, saying that they jump lights and weave dangerously through traffic.

The double gold medal winner also said that accidents were ‘not always the car’s fault’ and insisted that laws should be brought in to make safety helmets compulsory.

She told how her sister, also a professional cyclist, had been knocked off her bike but survived because she was wearing a helmet.

Miss Trott, 21, from Essex, said: ‘Cyclists wonder why they get a bad name. I see cyclists jumping in and out of the buses and people wonder why they get hit.

‘It’s not always the car’s fault. Cyclists need to help themselves and should not jump red lights. I would ride in London but I certainly wouldn’t ride like that, you just have to be careful.

‘I can understand going down the outside of traffic but you should obey the rules of the road because we’re all road users.’

Cyclist deaths are at a five-year high nationwide, with 122 people killed last year and more than 3,200 seriously injured in road accidents.

The cyclist- who won gold in the Omnium and team pursuit events in the velodrome at the Olympics - said that helmets should be compulsory for cyclists.

Life-saver: Laura Trott revealed said a helmet stopped her sister from suffering serious injuries when she was hit by a car in Belgium

She said that the lesson had been drummed into her from a young age by her parents and her sister’s experiences had only proved these lessons right.

In 2010, her sister Emma, 23, broke her collarbone and suffered a concussion that was so bad she ‘barely knew who she was’ when a car hit five British cyclists in Belgium.

Miss Trott, the chief cycling ambassador for the London Mayor Boris Johnson, believes that her sister’s life was saved by the helmet she wore.

She said: ‘When I was 11 I didn’t want to look uncool but my parents wouldn’t let me out unless I was wearing it.

‘I think it should be a legal 
requirement to wear a helmet. So many lives have been saved by them and 
it saved my sister’s life. She got hit by a car and cut her head open.

‘When
Emma called from hospital she barely even knew who she was, so if she 
wasn’t wearing a helmet now, she wouldn’t be here today.

‘For me, putting my helmet on now is a habit and I’ll wear it even if I’m going to the shop for a pint of milk.’

Debate: Cyclists weaving in and out of traffic and jumping red lights are a danger, Miss Trott said

Help themselves: Cyclists need to obey the rules of the road to be safe, the Olympic gold medal winner added

She joins Sir Bradley Wiggins, the four-time Olympic gold medallist and first Briton to win the Tour de France, in calling for helmets to be made compulsory.

He previously said: ‘I think certain laws for cyclists need to be passed to protect us more than anything.

‘Making helmets compulsory on the roads, making it illegal to maybe have an iPod in while you’re riding a bike, just little things like that would make a huge difference.’

Miss Trott also hailed a new £913million cycling fund to create a cycle superhighway and bike-friendly paths on accident blackspots in London.

She said: ‘It shows we’re becoming a cycling nation and the scheme is needed now. If you don’t do it then London’s roads are going to be filled with cyclists. We need more bike lanes in central London.’
