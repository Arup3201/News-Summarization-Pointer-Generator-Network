For all those Britons with an overseas holiday booked and paid for – but still waiting for their long-delayed passports to drop through the letter box, it wasn’t the most tactful of remarks.

Tourism minister Helen Grant suggested they consider holidaying at home. In fact, she said, there was a ‘lot to be said for the “staycation”.’

To rub salt into the wound, the minister’s pronouncement emerged as she watched England take on Uruguay – in her other role as sports minister – in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Last night her intervention attracted a
 furious response with victims of the passport crisis denouncing her 
comments as ludicrous and appalling.

Earlier
 this week, Home Secretary Theresa May apologised to people whose travel
 plans had been disrupted by delays at the Passport Office – there is a 
backlog of around 30,000 applications – and unveiled a series of 
emergency measures to speed matters up.

Miss
 Grant, asked about the situation in an interview with political 
magazine The House, said: ‘I’m in no doubt, I’m very confident that 
people will get their passports.

‘But
 if they don’t want to go away, we have some fantastic places to visit 
and holiday. I think there’s a lot to be said for the “staycation”. 
People need to do what they like.

‘We
 are going to have a great summer, we are certainly going to have a 
great summer of sport too, there’s lots of opportunities to build your 
holiday around a spoilt-for-choice list of events – the Tour de France 
Grand Depart, we’ve got the golf, we’ve got the Commonwealth Games. It’s
 a wonderful place to have your holiday.’

Government
 sources said it was clear Miss Grant, the MP for Maidstone and the 
Weald, had not been telling people where to holiday, but simply 
extolling the virtues of Britain as a destination.

However, retired 
nurse Eileen Shepherd, 68 – who had to miss out on a £1,750 cruise after
 she was told the day before she was due to sail that her passport was 
not ready – said of Miss Grant: ‘How dare she tell us where to go on 
holiday? Cheeky sod. People will be gunning for her.’

Mrs
 Shepherd, of Darlington added: ‘She is not living in the real world. It
 is appalling. Ministers have no business telling me where I can take a 
break.’

Martin Cook, 43, 
from Ipswich, only got his passport the day before he flew out to Prague
 for a weekend away with his wife Annabel last month, despite submitting
 his application four weeks earlier.

Miss Grant had said she was confident the passport application backlog would be cleared, despite holidaymakers queuing outside the Passport Office in London

The
 BT project manager said: ‘Helen Grant’s comments are laughable. It is 
ludicrous. It is not her place to tell people where to holiday. If 
somebody has made their plans and put their passport application in in 
good time they should be able to travel where they like.’

Labour
 also condemned Miss Grant’s remarks. David Hanson, immigration 
spokesman, said: ‘What does she know that we don’t? Is this crisis going
 to last all summer? Holidays in Britain are fantastic but ministers 
shouldn’t be trying to divert attention from the chaos  they created.

‘People
 need their passports for business, family funeral visits, residency 
permits and other personal reasons as well as holidays. Helen Grant 
should be on to the Home Office to get this sorted now, rather than 
telling families they won’t be going abroad any time soon.’

But
 Labour also risked embarrassment, after former minister Tom Watson 
appeared to agree with Miss Grant. ‘It’s already bad enough that holiday
 companies ramp up the cost of flights in school holidays,’ he said. 
‘Perhaps the passport fiasco will encourage people to stay at home, to 
support the British tourism industry.’

Passport
 officials say they have been hit by the highest level of applications 
for 12 years, with the usual summer increase starting far earlier than 
usual.

David Cameron has 
said that anyone with imminent travel  plans would be fast-tracked  
without charge. Applicants renewing from overseas will have a  12-month 
extension to their  existing passport.

A
 Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesman said: ‘Helen Grant 
was crystal clear that she was confident that people would get their 
passports to be able to travel overseas. As tourism minister it is 
completely right that she champions the domestic tourism market but she 
was in no way linking the two issues.’
