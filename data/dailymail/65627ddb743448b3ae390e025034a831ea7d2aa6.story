Gary Glitter is to go on trial on a new charge of trying to rape an eight-year-old girl at his home in the 1970s.

A High Court judge has granted permission for the case against the 70-year-old singer to go ahead after a rare request by prosecutors.

They took the step as a magistrate had ordered the charge to be stayed, or legally put on hold, in 1998 because of a delay in bringing it to court.

Mr Justice Globe said he did not regard it as unfair that Glitter should face the extra charge.

However, he added: ‘My decision in this case is not a green light to prosecutors to seek to resurrect old cases.’

Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, has already been accused of eight charges of sex offences against two girls of 12 and 14 from 1975-80.

The assaults are alleged to have happened at hotels or a nightclub.
