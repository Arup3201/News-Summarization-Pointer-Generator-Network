A Madison County Justice Court judge faces accusations that he struck a 
mentally disabled man and used racial slurs while working as a security 
guard at an event in Canton.

The family of the 20-year-old African-American man, Eric Rivers, has filed a police complaint against Judge Bill Weisenberger in
 connection with the May 8 incident at a flea market.

WLBT-TV reports 
that the Madison District attorney said the case will go to a grand 
jury.

The family of the 20-year-old African-American man, Eric Rivers, has filed a police complaint against Judge Bill Weisenberger in connection with an incident in which they say he used a racial slur

Witnesses told The Clarion-Ledger that Weisenberger, who is white, struck the young man and yelled racial slurs, telling the man to 'Run, n-----, run.'

William Truly of a Mississippi NAACP chapter said Weisenberger should stop hearing cases or resign pending an investigation.

'This is 2014,' Truly told The Clarion-Ledger 'not 1960, where someone could slap a young man and call out, 'Run, 
n-----, run.'

The judge is accused of striking the mentally disabled man and using racial slurs while working as a security guard at a flea market

Weisenberger has not commented and did not immediately return a phone call seeking a response Sunday afternoon.

Cathy Hendrix of Tuscaloosa, a vendor at the 
Canton Flea Market, told The Clarion-Ledger that she and other vendors 
rely on local people to help load and unload their vehicles, paying for 
the help.

On May 8, she saw Rivers standing on the 
sidewalk, asking if they needed help, she said. “That young man was 
wanting to work to earn money to buy a bike.”

William Truly of the Canton NAACP has asked that the judge resign or at least stop hearing cases pending a full investigation

Her sister, Tammy Westbrook, also of 
Tuscaloosa, told the newspaper she saw Weisenberger “rear back and slap”
 Rivers twice and use a racial epithet as the Rivers ran.

“No citizen should have to face justice before
 a judge who holds such a high degree of racial animus and hatred,” 
Truly said in a news conference Friday.
