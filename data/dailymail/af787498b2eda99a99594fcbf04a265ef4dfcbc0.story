Co-worker Taylor Byars, who was also on the trip, unsuccessfully looked for him before he left the park and was able to contact authorities two days later, the paper said.

Ventura County Sheriff's Captain Luis Obregon told the Daily News an air crew was used on Sunday to search for Herdman.

A Monday search party involved horses and Arcadia fire department authorities, the News reported. A spokesman said Herdman may still be alive.Â

Herdman is 'an elite athlete and family man who planned to be home on Father's Day,' NBC Los Angeles said. Herdman, it said, went missing while only wearing a T-shirt and a pair of shorts.

'He's in incredible shape,' Sgt. Eric Buschow told the station.

'But even with experience in the back country, if you don't have the right clothing and you don't have the right gear, it can be a tough situation to get out of.'
