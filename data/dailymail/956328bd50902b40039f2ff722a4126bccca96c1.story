The parents of a baby who doctors gave a less than one per cent chance of survival when he was born have created a bucket list for their son as he continues to defy the odds and live another day.

Corbin McHenry was born 32 weeks prematurely with the rare genetic disorder 'Trisomy 13' to Lance Corporal Shane McHenry and Kara McHenry, from Havelock, North Carolina.

The couple were told about the disorder 20 weeks into what was a 'normal' pregnancy after doctors noticed a large cyst on one of her ovaries.

Miracle: Corbin McHenry was born 32 weeks prematurely with 'Trisomy 13' to Lance Corporal Shane McHenry and Kara McHenry, from Havelock, North Carolina

Disorder: Tests showed a number of 'soft markers' on some of the baby's organs and they thought he may have Down Syndrome but further tests confirmed Trisomy13

Proud parents: Kara and Shame McHenry enjoy every precious moment with their son

Little hero: As he continues to amaze his family at 110 days old by merely living, they decided to create a bucket list for him and treat every day as if it was his birthday

Bundle of joy: As he continues to amaze his 
family by merely living and fighting, the couple created a 
bucket list for him and treat every day as if it was his birthday

More tests showed a number of 'soft markers' on some of the baby's organs and they thought he may have Down Syndrome.

When further tests confirmed that it was in fact Trisomy 13, Kara was confused as she wasn't sure what it was. It did not take long for the severity to sink in.

'The nurse explained Trisomy 13 as the 
presence of an extra thirteenth chromosome, three instead of the normal 
two,' she wrote on their website.

'Well much like anyone else I thought, "Great extra! Extra is good, 
it’s better than a little or too much" but I was wrong.

'I quickly got off the phone and 
researched this Trisomy 13 and my heart instantly sank. Words like "severe mental retardation", "death before age one", "physical 
abnormalities", and "incompatible with life" began to flood my screen.

When she was rushed into hospital with preeclampsia at 32 weeks, doctors warned the couple the baby may not come out alive.

Kara turned to God.

She said: 'For the first time in my life I had to 
believe in a higher power, for the first time in my life I caught myself
praying aloud that my baby boy would cry. I just wanted him to cry.

'Sure enough, on April 4th, 2013, God answered my prayers and at 9:53pm 
Corbin Alfred McHenry at 4 pounds 4 ounces and 17 inches long was born 
breathing and crying.'

But doctors told the McHenrys he 
would never live and gave him a less than one per cent chance of 
survival.

The hours turned into days and days into weeks and now baby Corbin is still going strong at 110 days old.

And as he continues to amaze his 
family by merely living and fighting, the couple have created a 
bucket list for him and treat every day as if it was his birthday.

It's full of simple things that most children do but probably take for granted, like saying a word or sliding down a
slide.

More adventurous options include being on TV, meeting someone 
famous or petting a giraffe.The McHenry's are hoping that little Corbin gets to tick off every item on the list.

Kara said of Corbin: 'He continues to progress daily and sometimes he has bad days but he¿s a fighter and he stays strong. 'Corbin is a fighter, he is my miracle child, and he is my hero'

Special life: The McHenrys treat each and every day of Corbin's life as if it was his birthday

'My main thing is i just want to get him out of the hospital. I just want to bring him home,' Shane McHenry said.

Kara said: 'This way of life may not be ideal for 
some people and others may choose a different route but this is the 
route we chose and this is Corbin’s fight.

'He continues to progress 
daily and sometimes he has bad days but he’s a fighter and he stays 
strong. 'Corbin is a fighter, he is my miracle child, and he is my hero.'

More than 80 per cent of babies born with Trisomy 13 die within the first year. It occurs in about one in 16,000 births. 

Trisomy 13 is a chromosomal condition associated with severe intellectual disability and physical abnormalities in many parts of the body.

Babies often have heart defects, brain or spinal cord abnormalities, very small or poorly developed eyes, extra fingers and/or toes, a cleft lip, a cleft palate and weak muscle tone.

Many infants with Trisomy 13 die within their first days or weeks of life. Only five percent to 10 percent of children with this condition live past their first year.

With medical bills mounting, friends, 
family and strangers are rallying together to make baby Corbin’s
bucket list dream a reality through a GiveForward fundraiser. You can donate by clicking here.
