Despicable Me 2 was in third with $16 million. The Universal 
animated sequel, with its cast of cute, yellow minions, has made more 
than $600 million worldwide since it came out four weeks ago.

The Wolverine, which is set in Japan and features an international cast, earned another $86.1 million overseas.

The
film's opening-week take surpassed the $120 million it cost to make, 
said Chris Aronson, Fox's head of domestic distribution.Â 

'It's a huge opening for the clawed one,' he said. 'It played equally well from Maine to Maui.'

Another
Fox film, the animated snail-racing tale Turbo, was in fourth place 
with $13.3 million. Adam Sandler's Grown Ups 2 followed with $11.5 
million.

Woody Allen's latest, Blue Jasmine, enjoyed a stellar opening of its own, though on a much smaller scale.

Starring Cate Blanchett, the film opened in just six theaters but still collected $612,767.

'It's one of the biggest opening 
per-theater averages ever for a non-animated film,' said Paul 
Dergarabedian of box-office tracker Hollywood.com.

Ticket sales this weekend were up almost 30 percent over the same weekend last summer, he said.

'It was a good weekend to be a 
moviegoer because the choices just got a lot more interesting,' 
Dergarabedian said, noting a mix that includes animated, independent and
big-budget action offerings.

Fruitvale
Station, the Sundance winner already generating Oscar buzz, expanded 
to theaters across the country and edged its way into the top 10, 
contributing to a summer box office that is up more than 10 percent over
last year.
