Panic spread through European stock markets yesterday as political paralysis in Italy sent shares tumbling.

The FTSE 100 index fell 84.93 points to 6270.44, wiping £21.5billion off the value of Britain’s blue chip firms. The losses were worse on the Continent with the stock market down 4.9 per cent in Milan, 3.2 per cent in Madrid, 2.7 per cent in Paris and 2.3 per cent in Frankfurt. Bank shares were the biggest fallers. Barclays and RBS lost more than 4 per cent.

The cost of borrowing surged in Italy and the cost of insuring the country’s debt against default climbed to its highest this year.

The markets plunged across the world 
after the Italian election resulted in deadlock thanks to one of the 
largest protest votes in living memory.

The result in Italy is expected to 
slow the country's recent economic gains, and threatens to tip the 
entire eurozone back into full-blown crisis mode.

In
a rejection of the austerity reforms needed to ease the country’s 
massive debt, more than a quarter of voters backed the Five Star 
Movement, led by comedian Beppe Grillo.

Meanwhile,
the disgraced former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi unexpectedly 
exploded back on the scene with 29.2 per cent of the vote.

German tabloid newspaper Bild expressed 
its horror at the election result and renewed instability in the 
financial markets with the headline, 'Are they going to destroy our euro
now?'

Mr Grillo's anti-euro and anti-austerity 
party, which took 25.6 per cent of the votes, was the most popular single party in Italy.

The Five Star Movement drew support away from both 
major parties, leading to the prospect of months of deadlock as 
politicans attempt to form a new government.

The centre-left groups, led by Pier Luigi Bersani, had 29.5 per
cent of the vote in the lower house, only just ahead of Mr Berlusconi's centre-right alliance.

Mr Grillo took to the internet to taunt the country's mainstream politicians over their disappointing performance.

'We've started a war of generations,' he said in a statement posted on his website. 'They are all losers, they've been there for 25 to 30 years and they've led this country to catastrophe.'

The charismatic anti-politician, who was once convicted of manslaughter, has vowed not to join a coalition with any other party, meaning politicians face deadlock in their attempts to form a government.

'The
winner is: Ingovernability' was the headline in Il Messaggero, while 
commentator Massimo Giannini wrote in La Repubblica: 'The "non-party" 
has become the largest party in the country.'

Despite Mr Grillo's success, a 
coalition between the centre-left and centre-right could be the most 
likely outcome after Mr Berlusconi this morning suggested he would 
consider teaming up with Mr Bersani, saying that both parties 'must be 
prepared to make sacrifices' and rejecting the possibility of fresh elections.

The centre-left was left in a state of shock by the results after failing to achieve the resounding win it had been expecting.

Enrico Letta, a senior member of Mr Bersani's party, insisted that his grouping should be first in line to try and form a government, while the leader said: 'We will handle the responsibilities that these elections have given us in Italy’s interest.'

Turnout was unusually low at 75 
per cent - historically, it has usually been above 80 per cent, though 
this is the first national election held during winter.

Mr Bersani is guaranteed a majority 
in the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, due to election rules 
giving the largest alliance more than 50 per cent of the seats.

But the situation in the Senate is 
much more confused - Mr Berlusconi's group is likely to be the largest 
with 116 seats, with Mr Bersani close behind on 113, but no party is 
close to a majority.

The party headed by current prime 
minister Mario Monti, who has emphasised the need for radical economic 
reforms and continued austerity, performed disappointingly, attracting 
just 10.6 per cent of votes.

Mr Monti took over the government in November 2011, with the support of both major parties, and pulled Italy back from the brink of an EU bailout by restoring investor confidence and lowering the interest rate on the country's bonds, which was unsustainably high.

This split raised the prospect of
a fresh election – and further delay to much-needed economic reforms in
the single currency’s third largest economy.

Competition: Mario Monti casting his vote- Mr Monti's party is expected to gain fourth place

Mr
Bersani, who was widely considered the favourite, has a reformist track
record and has worked closely with Mr Monti, leading to hopes that he 
would continue along the same path.

However,
the election results mean that if he is to have any hope of power he 
will depend on either Mr Grillo or the mercurial Mr Berlusconi, who are 
likely to reject the austerity demanded by the German government and 
other international lenders.

If investors begin to doubt that 
Italy will enact reforms to keep its economy on track, the damage will 
quickly spread to other European countries, amidst fears that Italy is 
too large for an EU bailout.

Leading centrists in the country 
lamented the results - Gianfranco Fini, a former foreign minister who 
lost his parliamentary seat in the election, said: 'The worst is yet to 
come for Italy.'

Paul Mortimer Lee, global head of market economics at BNP Paribas, said today that the election result was likely to shave up to one per cent from Italy's growth rate this year.

‘There’s no alternative to the austerity that the EU wants,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. 'But the politicians are not going to offer that up on a plate because it’s a recipe for rejection.

‘The Italian people are saying we don’t want to do the hard yards. The news will have to get worse and a lot worse before it gets better.’

As soon as results started
to be declared last night, the euro began falling, reaching a seven-week low against the dollar by this morning.

The single currency has rallied strongly in recent weeks as fears of an imminent break-up of the eurozone eased.

But analysts said a change of 
government in Italy – and the possible return of Mr Berlusconi – could see 
the austerity measures implemented by outgoing leader Mr Monti 
reversed and plunge the economy deeper into crisis.

The Five Star Movement has come from nowhere in three years to secure 
the vote of one in four Italians.

Its 64-year-old leader, Mr Grillo, 
attracted hundreds of thousands of supporters as he toured town squares
in a camper van. Much of his support comes from young Italians, who are
frustrated by never-ending corruption scandals and mobilised by 
social media.

Shock: Opinion polls had underestimated the appeal of the Five Star Movement in the run-up to the election

Fragmented: Seats in the Senate are allocated on the basis of the country's regions

Earlier exit polls had shown the 
centre-left coalition ahead in both houses. But initial optimism from 
market investors soon evaporated once later projections pointed to a 
lead for Mr Berlusconi’s centre-right coalition.

The former premier, who resigned 15 
months ago after bringing Italy to the brink of economic ruin, has made 
an astonishing comeback.

His trial, on charges of paying for 
sex with an underage girl, has been postponed until after the election. 
Mr Bersani, a former communist, would have to win both houses to form a 
stable government. He has said he would continue with reforms begun by 
technocrat Mr Monti.

The country is likely to endure political horse-trading over the next few days to try to appoint a government.

If no party can form a majority, 
another caretaker technocratic government may have to take power until 
fresh elections can be held in May.

Robert O’Daly, of the Economist 
Intelligence Unit, said: ‘Under a scenario where the combined 
parliamentary representation of Mr Bersani’s centre-left and Mr Monti’s 
centrists is insufficient to form a majority, a period of minority 
government followed by further elections would be likely.

‘Such an outcome would place strong 
additional upward pressure on government borrowing costs. If this were 
to continue for a prolonged period, it could be destabilising for other 
distressed peripheral euro area countries.’
