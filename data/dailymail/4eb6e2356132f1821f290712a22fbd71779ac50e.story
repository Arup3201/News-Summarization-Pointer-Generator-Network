Greek singer Demis Roussos famed for his hits in the seventies and eighties has died aged 68 after suffering from an undisclosed illness.

The Egyptian-born performer saw his popularity rise in the 1960s and 70s after joining progressive rock group Aphrodite's Child.

He was best-known for his hits Forever And Ever and Goodbye as well as providing the soundtrack to the 1977 TV play Abigail's Party. He sold 60 million records worldwide. 

Mr Roussos was born in 1946 in Alexandria, Egypt as Artemios Ventouris Roussos to a Greek father and an Egyptian mother of Italian origin.

The family fled to Greece after losing all their possessions during the Suez crisis.

Aged 17, he began his music career joining a band called The Idols, where he met his future Aphrodite's Child band mates.

Aphrodite's Child made three hit albums, which enjoyed success across Europe in the late 1960s.

Mr Roussos then went on to enjoy a solo career in the 1970s, with his song Forever And Ever topping the UK charts in 1976.

His other hits included My Friend the Wind, My Reason, Happy To Be On An Island In The Sun and Someday Somewhere.

He made one of his earliest appearances on English-language TV on the Basil Brush Show and became known as the 'Kaftan King' following his fondness for the garments.

He was also a regular target for parody, with comics including Freddie Starr and The Grumbleweeds taking aim at him, but was immortalised for many in the Mike Leigh TV play Abigail's Party.

The scene where Alison Steadman's character's expressed her devotion to Roussos who she says 'doesn't sound' fat is regularly replayed.

Mr Roussos, whose popularity soared in the 1970s,  was known for his love of kaftans, left, and long flowing hair

Roussos, who died in Athens, said his success in the UK was down to the rise of foreign holidays.

He told The Scotsman: 'The reason for my big success in England was the Brits - they started wanting to go on holidays, like Spain and Greece.

'My music came right on time. It was romantic Mediterranean music addressed to all the people who wanted to go on holiday. My music was liked by the people.'

In 1985, the singer was caught up in a plane hijacking when flight TWA 847 from Athens to Rome was hijacked by members of Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad.

He and his third wife were held as prisoners in Beirut for five days before they were released.

Mr Roussos has struggled with he weight throughout his life and co-wrote a book about obesity

Speaking on French radio, fellow singer Nana Mouskouri paid tribute to Mr Roussos, pictured, saying he had a superb voice

His last public appearance came in 2013 in Athens, when he was honoured for his life's work by receiving a French Legion of Honour medal.  

He had been in the private Hygeia Hospital  for sometime and died early on Sunday morning.

In a tribute on French radio, fellow singer Nana Mouskouri said: 'He had a superb voice, he traveled in the world ... he loved what he was doing.

'He was an artist, a friend. I hope he is in a better world.'
