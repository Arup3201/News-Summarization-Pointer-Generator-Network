Paul Ryan had a rocky first solo day of campaigning since joining Mitt Romney’s presidential ticket when he had to cut a speech short after hecklers interrupted him at the Iowa State Fair.

He had spent only a few moments on the soapbox when several hecklers began shouting about his proposed Medicare reforms, two of whom attempted to jump on the stage with him.

Attempting to brush off the interruption by bonding with the crowd over his Midwestern roots, Congressman Ryan tried to move past the issue as three people were eventually escorted out of the area by state police.

Addressing the crowd: Paul Ryan attended the Iowa State Fair as his first solo appearance since being selected as Mitt Romney's running mate on Saturday

Candidate interrupted: Two female hecklers began shouting about his proposed Medicare cuts shortly after Ryan began speaking and he brushed the incident off saying they must not be Iowans because Iowans are polite

‘You know it’s funny because Iowans and Wisconsinites, we like to be respectful of one another and listen to each other. These ladies must not be from Iowa or Wisconsin,’ he said to the crowd.

When one of the female protesters tried to get on the stage, Ryan appeared startled- ‘Hey, alright!’ he said- before the remainder of the crowd urged him on with chants of ‘USA! USA!’

In spite of his efforts to get back on track, Ryan did end up speaking for only 12 minutes instead of the customary 20 minutes.

A spokesman from the Iowa State Police told Buzzfeed that none of the three hecklers were removed from the fair, simply from the area where Ryan was speaking, and none of them were arrested.

Ryan’s visit to the Iowa State Fair was his first solo campaign event following a weekend of joint appearances following the announcement of his selection as the Republican vice presidential candidate on Saturday.

The move comes as little surprise since Iowa is a pivotal swing state that was won by President Obama in 2008.

Taken out: Iowa State Police confirmed that three people- including these two women- were removed from the area but none of them were arrested and they were allowed to stay at the fair

During their interview with CBS on Sunday, Romney and Ryan said that they would be spending much of the campaign apart in an effort to double their forces and cover more ground.

Romney said that the addition of Ryan to the ticket was a way to even the playing field as he has been campaigning by himself against President Obama and Vice President Biden up until now.

In that same vein, Ryan and Obama battled it out for coverage today as they were both in Iowa and though they did not run into each other at any point, they made a point to pass messages through their supporters.

‘As you see the president come through in his bus tour, you might ask him the same question that I'm getting asked from people all around America. And that is, “Where are the jobs, Mr. President?”’ Ryan said after the furvor died down as the hecklers were removed.

The President spent much of his time in the state looking at the damage caused by the continuing drought and talking to some of the state’s many farmers about the proposed plan to use $170million in federal aid to provide short-term relief to those impacted by the record-breaking heat.

Popular state: President Obama began his bus tour in Iowa on the same day and focused his rhetoric on a proposed bill that would provide $170m in assistance to drought-riddled farmers

Introducing himself: Ryan tried to connect with fair-goers over their shared Midwestern roots

In keeping with his strategy of painting Ryan as a Republican ‘idealogue’ that has prevented Congressional compromise, Obama talked about the opposition that the bill faces in Congress.

‘I’m told Gov. Romney's new running mate might be around Iowa these next few days, and he's one of those leaders of Congress standing in the way,’ Obama said.

‘So if you happen to see Congressman Ryan, tell him how important this farm bill is to Iowa and our rural communities. We've got to put politics aside and do right thing for rural America and Iowa.’

Considering Ryan’s Midwestern roots- and the importance of the swing state- the Iowa State Fair comes as a predictable first outing for the Congressman.

The fair has also had a special place in the Romney campaign’s timeline, as it was at the same event last year when the former Governor made the much-publicized comment that ‘corporations are people too, my friend’.

During his brief interaction with fairgoers as he walked to and from the stage, he highlighted his interest in similar activities.

‘We do cow milking contests in Wisconsin,’ Ryan said. He said that he also enjoyed watching demolition derbies.
