She has come under fire for the 'shortcomings' of her Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act scheme.

Now, more students and parents have posted photos of Michelle Obama's 'measly' school lunches.

The images, which were all posted on Twitter with the hashtag #ThanksMichelleObama, range from a slice of moldy salami in a wrap and a green hotdog to a small portion of salad with a side of cheese.

They come as the School Nutrition Association has called on Congress to amend the First Lady's school meal restrictions, which have led to '1.4million fewer children choosing school lunch each day'.

'Thanks Michelle Obama': The Twitter pictures - including this image of a moldy hotdog - come as the School Nutrition Association has called on Congress to amend the 51-year-old First Lady's school meal restrictions

US First Lady: On Thursday, Mrs Obama appealed for parents to do more to help fight childhood obesity

The SNA, which represents 55,000 school food service professionals, released its 2015 Position Paper last week as lawmakers continue to prepare to reauthorize the widely-criticized scheme.

In the recent batch of photos, one female student tweeted a photo of a slice of moldy salami and another piece of meat in a wrap, with the caption: 'Had a yummy lunch today guys! Salami and mold.'

Meanwhile, another student, Cole Sahr, posted an image of what appear to be two thin wraps filled with meat, with a small side portion of carrots. In his caption, he deemed the meal 'pathetic'. 

Mariah Dilbeck also uploaded a picture of her school lunch, comprising apricot slices, a piece of toast, a carton of juice, a smidgen of butter and a bread roll that was apparently 'cold'. 

And Ella, a student in the Fairfax County Public Schools network, tweeted an image of a small bowl of salad and cheese, with the caption: 'This is the salad I got today #FCPS #ThanksMichelleObama.'

In its Position Paper, the SNA laid out the devastating effect the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010's limits has had on the number of students participating in the National School Lunch Program.

Angry: The SNA, which represents 55,000 school food service professionals, released its 2015 Position Paper last week, Above, student Katie Caldwell posted the picture of a not-as-expected 'spicy chicken wrap'

'Pathetic': Another student, Cole Sahr, posted an image of what appear to be two thin wraps filled with meat (pictured), with a small side portion of carrots. In his accompanying caption, he deemed the meal 'pathetic'

Another let down: The SNA, which represents 55,000 school food service professionals, released its 2015 Position Paper last week as lawmakers continue to prepare to reauthorize the widely-criticized scheme

'USDA data shows that since the new rules were implemented, 1.4 million fewer children choose school lunch each day,' according to the release, obtained by EAG.org.

'Declining student participation reduces meal program revenue for schools already stressed by higher food and labor costs under the new regulations.' 

In the release, the SNA suggests several fixes to the scheme. These include increasing the per-meal reimbursement for school lunches by 35 per cent, according to the site. 

They also include maintaining Target 1 sodium level reduction and suspending the implementation of further targets, and ensuring at least half of grains offered are whole grain rich, The Hill reported.

Other suggestions include permitting school food managers to decide if students should take a fruit or vegetable as part of a reimbursable meal, and easing restrictions on a la carte food items. 

'Cold bread roll': Mariah Dilbeck also uploaded a picture of her school lunch (pictured), comprising apricot slices, a piece of toast, a carton of juice, a smidgen of butter and a bread roll that was apparently 'cold'.

Mrs Obama made herself a national emblem of healthier eating in 2010 with a legislative push for more fruit, vegetables and whole grains in school meals, along with less sodium, sugar and fat.

School nutritionists and food service workers, and their unions, hailed the law's passage but have since turned on Mrs Obama, saying her caloric inflexibility has sparked a downturn in lunch sales.

Many school districts, they say, are now losing money on food instead of turning a profit that pays for books, computers and football-field scoreboards. 

In a news release, SNA CEO Patricia Montague said: 'Some of USDA’s regulations under the law have unnecessarily increased costs and waste for school meal programs and caused many students to swap healthy school meals for junk food fare' 

Last year, Mrs Obama  vowed to fight for the current school meal restrictions 'until the bitter end to make sure that every kid in this country continues to have the best nutrition that they can have.'.

According to Fox News, she said: 'The last thing that we can afford to do right now is play politics with our kids' health, especially when we're finally starting to see some progress on this issue.'

And on Thursday, she appealed for parents to do more to help during a visit to New York.

She told members of the public to 'dive into' the fight against childhood obesity - and listed a number of specific ways in which parents can help in that battle, NEWSOK reported. 

In March, around 1,000 school nutrition professionals from across America will descend on Capitol Hill as part of the 43rd annual Legislative Action Conference's 'Charge the Hill' campaign.
