Amelia Abbott just turned five last month and all she can think about is starting ‘big girl school’ next year and growing up to be a ‘princess ballerina’.

Only a few months ago, these dreams were looking far from realistic, but thanks to her three-year-old brother Lachy – things are well and truly looking up for the beautiful little girl.

There was a 25 per cent chance of Lachy being a bone marrow match for his older sister Amelia Abbott, 5, from the Gold Coast in Queensland, who was in desperate need of a helping hand after battling acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a type of blood cancer which particularly hits children.

But Lachy did so much more than that by providing a very rare 'perfect match' with his sibling – a moment his mother, Michelle Abbott, has described as nothing short of 'magical'.

‘It was just awesome – we were just ecstatic to know Lachy was able to help her to heal and be a part of her journey,’ she told Daily Mail Australia. 

Amelia was categorised in the low risk category when she was diagnosed in December but within three months, after chemotherapy, she rapidly escalated to extremely high risk with just a 40 per cent chance of recovery.

‘I was glad I was sitting down when I got the news – I was absolutely beside myself,’ she said.

But the best possible news was delivered to the family in March when Lachy had an unusual 10 out of 10 bone marrow match with his sister. 

'I did have a mother's instinct that he would be a match, but it was amazing when the news came,' Mrs Abbott said.

The way Michelle and her husband Chris explained to their three year-old son that he was going to be the unique gift to Amelia was by reading him a book.

'We sat down and explained to him with a superhero story, and he thought it was an awesome story, she said.

Lachy had 280ml of barrow marrow removed, which was transplanted into Amelia just a few hours later on July 9. Amazingly, his young body has replaced this marrow within a few weeks.

‘He woke and all he wanted to do was see Amelia, but she was in isolation so he waved at her through the window,’ she said.

When the pair reunited five weeks later, Michelle was glad to have her camera on hand to capture the heart-warming moment.

The huge grin on Amelia’s face spoke a million words when she held her little brother.

‘He ran into the room and they just embraced,’ she said. ‘They don’t go well when they don’t see each other for a while.’

Only 17 months apart in age, Amelia and Lachy have always had a close relationship which has significantly strengthened since the beginning of this special journey.

‘She has always been like his little mother since he was born and he’s her strength – they are more like twins,’ she said.

‘And now they have a bond that will never be broken – it has been magical to watch it grow.’

When Michelle and her husband, Chris, had to tell Amelia who was only four at the time, that she was sick, they decided to break it down in a way she would easily understand.

‘I told her that the chemo was Pacman, who had to eat the nasties inside her,’ she said.

But when the chemotherapy wasn't successful, they had another chat with their daughter about her brother helping out.

Her instant response proved her extraordinary understanding of a complex situation for a child who had not yet turned five.

‘Pacman is not doing a good enough job so Lachy’s super cells are going in to help. But Pacman is still on guard to help kill them off if they come back,’ Amelia told her parents.

'She’s an intelligent young girl,’ her mother said. ‘She’s my strength and always has positivity.’

‘She says “I’ll get those nasties” – it’s been an amazing journey.’

Six weeks after her transplant, Amelia was given the all clear for the first time.

But Thursday is the big day for Amelia as she has her 100-day test.

In the meantime, Amelia’s family and friends are participating in the Leukaemia Foundation of Queensland’s Light the Night 2014 at Broadwater Parklands, Marine Pde in Southland, Queensland at 4pm on Wednesday.
