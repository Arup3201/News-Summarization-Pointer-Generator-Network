Manchester United are stepping up their interest in West Ham’s teenage defender Reece Oxford.

The 15-year-old is already a target for Arsenal and Chelsea but United staff consider him the best young defender in the country and are keen to strike a deal.

West Ham have offered a lucrative contract to Oxford but he is yet to commit.

Arsenal have sent scouts to watch the stylish centre-back on numerous occasions and were represented again last week when Oxford played for West Ham U21s against Sunderland.

The 6ft 3ins tall teenager, who turns 16 in December, captained England U17s in the summer and was an unused substitute for West Ham in their Capital One Cup defeat to Sheffield United in September.

Oxford was at The Emirates for Arsenal’s Champions League tie with Galatasaray on Wednesday and Arsene Wenger sees the prospect as someone who could progress quickly into their first team set-up.

United, though, are prepared to fight all the way for Oxford. Although they have had to blood Paddy McNair, Tom Thorpe and Tyler Blackett, Oxford has the potential to overtake them.

Despite spending £165million on their first team, United are determined to improve the quality of young players they have coming through. They signed Ajax defender Timothy Fosu-Mensah, 16, last month and have given trials to Feyenoord’ s Tahith Chong while maintaining an interest in 15-year-old Norway international and Liverpool target Martin Odegaard.

They also came close to signing another West Ham prospect, left-back Oscar Borg, 16, but that deal fell through.

Losing Oxford at this stage would be a blow to West Ham from both football and financial perspectives with the club likely to receive just £250,000 in compensation should he go.

Joint-chairman David Sullivan said last month: ‘It almost makes you give up on having an academy if they can come in and nick your best 15-year-old. What’s the point?’
