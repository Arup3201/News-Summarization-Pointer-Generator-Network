New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie blew off on Tuesday claims by a nurse that she was treated inhumanely when she was under mandatory quarantine over the weekend for Ebola.

Speculating about the possibility of a lawsuit from the nurse, Kaci Hickox, Christie said, 'Whatever. Get in line. I've been sued lots of times before.

'Get in line. I'm happy to take it on,' he added, according to CNN.

Say sorry for what?: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, center, pictured here today in New Jersey, told reporters yesterday that quarantined nurse Kaci Hickox had 'access to...takeout food from the best restaurants in Newark'

Christie disputed the nurse's claims that she was mistreated and pointed out that the tent she was confined to was indoors, not outdoors, as early reports claimed.

'There's been all kinds of malarkey...about this,' Christie told reporters who trailed while on a campaign stop in Rhode Island. 

'She was inside the hospital in a climate-controlled area with access to her cell phone, access to the internet, and takeout food from the best restaurants in Newark,' he said.

Christie has been heavily scrutinized over his decision to keep Hickox in quarantine for several days after she tested negative for Ebola.

The nurse came from West Africa by way of a New Jersey airport last week. She found herself summarily quarantined by state health officials after they detected she had a slight fever - a common symptom of Ebola. 

But even after the nurse's fever subsided, health officials kept her confined to a tent at a local hospital that had no shower or flushable toilet.

She has obtained a high-powered civil rights lawyer to defend her in a potential lawsuit. The lawyer, Norman Siegel, told Reuters on Sunday that Hickox's quarantine raised 'serious constitutional and civil liberties issues.'

The New Jersey government has since allowed Hickox to return to her home in Maine. 

Christie, a possible, 2016 presidential candidate, has denied that her release was an about-face, however.

He has also refused to rescind the state's new policy requiring health workers returning from West Africa to self-quarantine at home for 21 days, the incubation period for Ebola.

On Tuesday he maintained that he didn't think he'd done anything wrong in keeping her isolated until health officials could be sure she didn't have Ebola. 

'We're trying to be careful here,' Christie said on NBC's Today show. 'This is common sense, and ... the American public believes it is common sense. And we're not moving an inch. Our policy hasn't changed, and our policy will not change.'

At the campaign event later that day Christie pointed out that the Centers for Disease and Control staff who were 'on the ground in University Hospital monitoring the conditions she was in' didn't think the state treated Hickox unfairly, either.

'She had access to the Internet and we brought her takeout food,' he said.

Pouncing on Christie's comment, Gawker called some of Newark's finest takeout restaurants and found that none of them delivered food to Hickox - or at least not to the restaurants' knowledge. 

As Christie noted New Jersey officials brought Hickox the food, so takeout restaurants may not have been away they were feeding the Ebola patient.
