England’s fourth Six Nations runners-up finish in succession has been labelled ‘unacceptable’ by RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie with head coach Stuart Lancaster told his side’s performances must improve in time for the World Cup.

Lancaster’s men suffered championship heartache on Saturday as their thrilling 55-35 victory over France at Twickenham – watched by a record audience of 9.6 million on terrestrial television audience – saw them fall six points short of securing a Six Nations first title since he was appointed in 2012.

Instead, his side had to settle for yet another second-place finish in their last competitive tournament before September’s World Cup, and Ritchie expressed his displeasure at the overall outcome.

Another Six Nations runner-up spot for England is unacceptable, RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie has said

‘Four years as runners-up is not acceptable and we are not happy with how that came about,’ he said. ‘If you go back through history, bearing in mind a lot of things, we should be, as a country, winning more in terms of Grand Slams, Six Nations championships, other things.

‘We had opportunities.

‘Let's be clear – entirely in our control. The Irish deserved the win because of what they did over the five matches. We did not do enough over the five matches. There's no point in bleating about it.

‘We simply didn't take opportunities, didn't do what we should have done, were not clever enough during parts of the game in order to deserve to win.’

England’s coaches were badly hamstrung by injuries in the build up to the tournament, with 11 players ruled out of their opening win over Wales in Cardiff and first-choice stars Manu Tuilagi, Joe Launchbury, Ben Morgan and Owen Farrell absent for the duration.

That resulted in the emphasis being placed in youngsters such as George Ford, Anthony Watson and Jonathan Joseph with Lancaster and his staff keen to highlight the depth that has emerged.

‘We're developing, this is a development opportunity' – I don't take that,’ Ritchie added. ‘I don't think we're in a development phase.

‘We should be going into every game, doing our utmost to win and to win well. We've got the resources, the talent, the ability. Saturday was a fantastic example of that.

‘We've got to make sure we come out for the World Cup and deliver.’
