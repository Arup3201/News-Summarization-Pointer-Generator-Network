Allegations: Cecily McMillan, 26 (pictured arriving at a hearing earlier this year) appeared in court to face allegations she threatened to kill a police officer's family during an incident on the New York subway

An Occupy Wall Street activist has been accused of threatening to kill a plain-clothed police officer's family during an incident on the New York subway. 

Cecily McMillan, 26, who was jailed for three months earlier this year for elbowing an officer during the 2012 demonstrations, allegedly made the threats when two fare-dodgers were being arrested. 

The graduate student from the New School appeared in a Manhattan court on Monday, charged with obstructing governmental administration during an altercation in Union Square station last December.

Officer Luis Castillo told the pretrial hearing that he heard McMillan accuse his partner, officer Brian Rothermel, of being a 'male chauvinist pig',The Guardian reported. 

He claims she then said: 'And he probably doesn't have any kids or a wife, but if he did, I'd kill them.'

McMillan has denied the misdemeanor charge which carries a year prison sentence if convicted.

According to her supporters' website, McMillan was 'arrested again' by the NYPD for filming the police as they arrested two people inside station.

The post reads: 'Cecily saw two plainly dressed men begin to abusively confront and interrogate a young couple. 

'When she began to question them about the harassment, it turned out the men were police officers who then arrested them. 

'Cecily followed them to the subway precinct, watching to make sure they were not further abused, and began to take a video of the arrest process from outside the precinct doors. 

McMillan, dubbed the 'queen of non-violence', was found guilty in May of assaulting a police officer during a demonstration two years before.

As the verdict was read out and she was led away from the court room, her supporters shouted: 'Shame! Shame! Shame!'

The student, who was 25 at the time, was sentenced to three years but served around eight on Rikers Island in New York. 

Her defense team maintained throughout the trial that she was startled and knocked the officer accidentally after he groped her left breast from behind.

During the subway incident, McMillan was said to have grabbed the officers hand when one of the fare-dodgers tried to hand over his ID. 

As the pair were taken away, she continued to film the incident on her phone.

Throughout the altercation, she claimed she was a lawyer, and when they reached the precinct doors, she tried to force her way in.

According to officer Castillo, she then started shouting and screaming before she was arrested and handcuffed. 

A trial will begin when a jury has been selected while the judge ruled that her previous assault charges must not be mentioned by the prosecution.  

McMillan was one of 56 people to be convicted at trial for the demonstrations in March 2012, while another 11 people have been acquitted.

The city had evicted Occupy's Zuccotti Park encampment four months earlier, but activists gathered there to celebrate the six-month mark.

McMillan (pictured outside a Manhattan court in May) denies the charges, saying she was only filming two plain-clothed police officers arresting two fare-dodgers at Union Square station, New York
