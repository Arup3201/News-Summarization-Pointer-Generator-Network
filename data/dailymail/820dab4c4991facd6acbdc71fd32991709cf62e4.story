About 90 per cent of snails eaten in France come from Eastern Europe according to French producers who are demanding a limit on exports. 

A campaign has begun to specify the origin of snails on boxes so people know exactly whey they are from.

'If we do not distinguish the 'made in France' from the 'made in Poland', we are shooting ourselves in the foot', Yves Detaigne, a centre-right senator, told The Times.

But according to expert Jacky Pommier, who organises an annual snail-eating festival in August, it is quite clear that snails from France are better. 

Burgundy snails, or Helix pomatia, are now protected by a ban which prevents them from being harvested during the reproductive season which falls between April 1 and June 30.

Mr Pommier says he has to serve Polish snails over his festival because there are not enough French snails.

But Joel Pre, chairman of the French Federation of Snail Producers, called for boxes of snails to say exactly where they are from.

He said if people knew the snails they were eating were from Poland instead of Dijon, people might think twice about eating them.

At the moment boxes of snails just say they are produced in the EU. 

British snail farmer Helen Howard has said buisness is booming. She sells Helix aspersa muller (petits gris) or maxima (gros gris) as well as the Helix pomatia known as Roman snails. 

Snails in tins can be expensive costing £21 for an 800g tin of Bourgougne snails.
