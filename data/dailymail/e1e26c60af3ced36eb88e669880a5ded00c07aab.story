Hoping to keep as much of his fortune to himself, investment firm billionaire Ken Griffin, 46, has claimed in divorce court that his wife is using their children to justify a monthly expense claim of $1 million.

As the proceedings continue to heat up between Griffin and his estranged wife Anne Dias Griffin, things are getting particularly nasty given there are billions of dollars and at least half a dozen properties at stake. 

Attempting to fight back against his former bride's demands for spousal support, Griffin listed monthly expenses that include $160,000 for holiday homes, $6,800 for groceries, $7,200 for dining, $2,000 for stationery, $60,000 for office space and professional staff and $300,000 for a private jet.

So far Dias Griffin has failed to obtain the monies as part of marital maintenance, however the New York Post is suggesting she is now trying a different tact and hoping the judge will award her the monthly million bucks payout as part of her child support payments. 

The couple, who filed for divorce last year, have three children under 10. 

In a statement, Dias Griffin said the filing is 'riddled with falsehoods and just another vindictive attempt by Ken Griffin - Illinois' richest billionaire - to punish his family and avoid his clear responsibility under Illinois law to maintain his children's lifestyle.' 

Dias Griffin's statement doesn't dispute the dollar numbers. But she said Griffin is refusing to give the kids 'the support to which they are accustomed and entitled under Illinois law.'

She has argued that her estranged husband is required to fund the children's lifestyle as it was during their parents' marriage and says the expenses are simply an accounting of all the couple's child-related expenses while they were married. 

Costly kids: In an escalating divorce battle, Chicago hedge-fund billionaire Ken Griffin says in court papers his wife, Anne Dias Griffin, wants $1 million a month for child-related expenses 

Dias Griffin is seeking to nullify the couple's prenup and claims Griffin is failing to pay adequate child support for their three kids..

Griffin has fought back at what he sees is his wifes money-grabbing attempt by using their children as an excuse.

He said he has even gone above and beyond what he needs to provide and has paid expenses that are solely for Dias' benefit, including a private chef, multiple house cleaners and a house manager/personal assistant. 

He said that while he declined to fund a $450,000 winter vacation, he did give her $45,000 for a winter break.

Griffin said Dias is trying to fund her 'opulent lifestyle' by saying her personal expenses should be part of child support. 

Crafty: In his filing, Griffin said Dias is demanding money for her own lifestyle 'under the guise' of the children's expenses.

Mr Griffin also attempted to further discredit his wife by saying she embellished her accomplishments while running her own hedgefund.

Griffin, who is worth $5.5 billion, said that he was the largest single investor in the Aragon hedgefund after their marriage in 2005 until 2009. 

The fund lost 5 percent in 2010 and 11 percent in 2011.

'Under Anne's management, Aragon lost money for four consecutive years,' he said in the filing.

Griffin has said that he is paying almost every single expense when it comes to the life of his children that include the salaries of four nannies.

His wife has receved around $40 milllion through a prenup the couple had between them.

For Mr Griffin, however, it appears enough is enough and he has now cut off Dias Griffin's access to his credit cards and their homes in New York, Aspen, Miami and Hawaii.

Ivory tower: Griffin is living in a $15 million penthouse at the Park Tower in Chicago during the proceedings 

The couple had married for 11 years when they decided to call it a day for good in 2014, but they separated in 2012.

Their three children are aged two, four and six.

Griffin, who is estimated to be worth more than $5billion, is seeking joint custody.

Dias, who has already secured more than $35million in the divorce, wants the children to herself.

She is asking the court to throw out their prenuptial agreement.
