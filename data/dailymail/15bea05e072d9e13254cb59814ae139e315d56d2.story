Singer Noel Harrison, known by millions for The Windmills of Your Mind, has died at the age of 79

Singer Noel Harrison, known by millions for hit song The Windmills of Your Mind, has died at the age of 79.

The son of actor Rex Harrison, who was best known for recording the song on The Thomas Crown Affair soundtrack, performed for the final time on Saturday evening.

He suffered a heart attack at his home in Devon and was taken to hospital - but died a few hours later.

Speaking after the star's death, his wife Lori Chapman said: 'He will be loved and missed by more people than I ever knew.'

She added that Harrison held an 'extremely successful' performance at the village hall in Black Dog, Devon, on Saturday, but had a 'long drive home' and was 'exhausted' when he returned.

Harrison's career took off after he moved to America as part of a 'British invasion' spearheaded by The Beatles - where he starred in TV series The Girl From UNCLE and released chart hit A Young Girl and Suzanne by Leonard Cohen.

His performance of The Windmills Of Your Mind won best song at the Oscars in 1968, and was later covered by other well-known artists, including Dusty Springfield and Petula Clark.

The father-of-five once said he had not anticipated the song would become so popular and his 'most notable piece of work'.

'It didn’t seem like a big deal at the time', he said of the track, which was the theme tune for the Amercian heist film The Thomas Crown Affair, starring Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway.

'I went to the studio one afternoon and sang it and pretty much forgot about it.

'I didn’t realise until later what a timeless, beautiful piece Michel Legrand and the Bergmans had written.

'It won best song at the 1968 Oscars and turned out to be my most notable piece of work.'

Harrison was born in London on January 29, 1934 to Rex Harrison and Collette Thomas - the first of his Hollywood star father's six wives.

He moved back to Britain in the 1990s and settled in Ashburton, Devon, before playing Glastonbury Festival's Spirit Of '71 stage in 2011.

He was married three times and had five children and four grandchildren from his first two marriages.

The actor and singer also had a passion for ski-racing - becoming British ski champion in 1953, before representing the country at the Olympics.

Stefanie Powers, Harrison's co-star in The Girl From UNCLE, has paid tribute to the star on Twitter.

She wrote: 'My darling friend Noel Harrison passed last night.

'Let us all light a candle to speed him on his way - he deserves to fly with the angels.'
