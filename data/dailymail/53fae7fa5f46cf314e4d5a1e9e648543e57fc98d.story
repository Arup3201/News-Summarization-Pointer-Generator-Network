Bad behavior: Former Morgan Stanley wealth manager John Kelly faces up to four years in prison if convicted of unlawful surveillance

A former Morgan Stanley executive's defense in a criminal case accusing him of secretly taping sex acts with three women has gone to the dogs.

According to court documents made public Thursday, the once high-powered wealth manager John C. Kelly told investigators last February that he had set up cameras in his Manhattan apartment to keep an eye on his pooch, but the device accidentally caught his sexual escapades.

'It’s on and sometimes stays on. So I accidentally recorded myself having sex because it’s always recording,' Kelly told police February 26, 2013. 

Mr Kelly, the son of a prominent New York City lawyer, pleaded not guilty today in Manhattan Supreme Court to 19 counts of unlawful surveillance and attempted unlawful surveillance.

The financier’s attorney, Benjamin Brafman, suggested that one of his client’s paramours had pressed charges against Kelly as payback for getting her arrested for vandalizing his home.

According to attorney Daniel Parker, who represents one of the women at the center of the case, the X-rated recordings were not made by accident since Kelly used a sophisticated surveillance system featuring a hidden camera, a webcam and a phone application to record his victims in his apartment and in their own homes, New York Post reported.

Parker added that Kelly even concealed a recording device in a bookshelf inside his East 69th Street apartment, and then shared the pornographic videos on YouTube and Vimeo.

had set up cameras to monitor his pooch (right) while he was at work, but
 the devices ended up recording his sexcapades

Accused pervert: John Kelly has worked for Morgan Stanley for nearly a decade

Officials said Kelly shot videos of 
his amorous activities with three different partners between September 
2011 and December 2012. Revelations of the conduct drove one woman to 
trash his apartment.

The women were in his apartment at separate times, the New York Daily News reported. 

‘In this case, the defendant videotaped three unrelated women while they were performing sexual acts on him in his home,’ said prosecutor Siobhan Carthy during the financier’s arraignment in November, the paper reported.

Victims ‘did not consent to such images being recorded and defendant did not have permission or authority to record or possess such images,’ the criminal complaint stated.

The breasts, buttocks and vagina of one of the victims could be clearly seen in the video, officials said.

In the doghouse: While Kelly has insisted that the surveillance was accidental, an attorney representing one of the victims claimed that the financier had a complex video recording system in place suggesting that he intended to tape his sex romps

Fall from grace: Kelly, the son of a prominent attorney, was fired from Morgan Stanley the same day he was arrested

One of the women who found out about the secret recordings broke into Mr Kelly’s apartment, according to the Daily News. She trashed the place, poured soda onto his computer and was charged with burglary, but that case should be dismissed, the paper noted.

Kelly was arrested in connection to the sex tapes November 8, 2013 - on the same day that he was fired from his job for allegedly writing bad checks.

His father, john Q. Kelly, once represented former New York Yankee player Joe Pepitone and the estate of Nicole Brown Simpson - the slain wife of O.J. Simpson.

John C. Kelly is due back in court April 10. He could face up to four years in prison if convicted of the charges against him.
