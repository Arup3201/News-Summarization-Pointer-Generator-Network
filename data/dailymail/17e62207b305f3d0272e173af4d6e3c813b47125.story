The daughter of killer taxi driver Christopher Halliwell has said her father told her he didn't know why he murdered Sian O'Callaghan.

Natasha Halliwell urged Halliwell, who is beginning a life sentence for the murder of nightclubber Miss O’Callaghan, to give the family of a second woman he killed 'justice' over her murder.

She told ITV Daybreak this morning he should 'do the right thing' and 'tell the truth' over the murder of missing prostitute Rebecca Godden.

Speaking on ITV Daybreak, Natasha said Halliwell had urged her to change her name a number of times

Christopher Halliwell pleaded guilty at Bristol Crown Court to Sian O'Callaghan's murder

She said: 'He needs to give the other family 
closure as well and give them the justice they need for their daughter.'

Asked whether her father ever explained 
to her what he did, Natasha said: 'No, never. He said to me, because I 
saw him, he said, "Don’t ask me why because I don’t know why". So I 
don’t think he even has an explanation.'

The 20-year-old was speaking after her father, of Swindon, Wiltshire, was jailed for life after pleading guilty at Bristol Crown Court to Miss O’Callaghan’s murder.

But he escaped justice over the murder of Miss Godden because of a police blunder.

Halliwell, 48, admitted to a senior detective that he murdered Miss O’Callaghan and Miss Godden, and even led officers to their bodies.

A High Court judge ruled that the confessions the father-of-three made during a three-hour period on the day of his arrest were inadmissible because Detective Superintendent Steve Fulcher breached police guidelines governing the interviewing of suspects.

The detective, who was leading the hunt for Miss O’Callaghan, failed to caution Halliwell and denied him a solicitor.

The ruling by Mrs Justice Cox meant that Wiltshire Police had no other evidence against Halliwell to link him to Miss Godden’s murder and the charge was withdrawn.

Ms Halliwell, speaking on ITV Daybreak, said she had received letters from her father but she has not replied to them.

She said he had urged her to change her name a number of times.

'We have had quite a few letters that have said "Sorry for putting you all through this" and things like this,' she said.

She added: 'As much as I want to hate him, I can’t.

'I pity him and I do feel sorry for him and I hate what he has done but I can’t hate him.'

Miss Godden’s father has hit out at police, saying they had 'made massive mistakes'.

'It seems to me: Come to Swindon, commit murder and you’ll get away with it,' John Godden told BBC News.

'And that’s the way I feel. I’ll never put my trust in the police again. Why should we pay with this pain for somebody else’s mistakes?

'I want proper closure. I want closure. I want justice.'
