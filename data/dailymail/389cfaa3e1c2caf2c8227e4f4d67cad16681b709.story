Daryl Janmaat insists he is speaking for the entire Newcastle dressing-room when he declares: ‘We do not want to get Alan Pardew sacked’.

The Holland defender has been one of the few positives on the pitch this season following his £5million move from Feyenoord.

United, though, remain in the bottom three and without a win in seven, leaving Pardew under pressure despite the support of owner Mike Ashley.

But Janmaat has now come out and added his voice to those defending the manager, admitting that supporter unrest is something he chooses to block out.

‘The team is playing for the manager, we do not want him to get sacked, we want him here,’ said the 25-year-old.

‘He is good for us and we are fighting for him. I don’t listen to what the fans are chanting, I focus on playing the game.’

Janmaat joined from Dutch side Feyenoord, but has not been able to help Newcastle to a league win so far

Pardew and his players need a victory at home to Leicester City a week on Saturday to avoid becoming the first Newcastle side to go eight without a win from the start of a Premier League season.

Janmaat – capped 23 times - was forced to withdraw from the Holland squad because of a slight hamstring injury this week but will be fit for the visit of the Foxes.

And he believes a maiden win is in sight.

‘We have a very important game when we come back (from the international break) and that is a game we have to win,’ he added.

‘We must keep working hard and I hope the next sequence of games will see us pick up a few more points.

‘We feel like that win is close, we were pretty close against Swansea (Saturday’s 2-2 draw) and now we have to make sure we do it against Leicester.

‘You cannot say there is any lack of effort. The last couple of games we have just missed a little bit with our finishing and if we improve this and keep playing like this then the wins will come.

He also remarked that he does not listen to the Newcastle fans' recent chants during matches

‘We’re fighting really hard for each other.’

Meanwhile, the club’s plans for a new state-of-the-art training ground have been unanimously approved by planners.

The Magpies intend to replace their existing facilities with a 3,600sq-m complex, including a gym, swimming pool, hydrotherapy pool, living and dining areas and outdoor barbecue zone.
