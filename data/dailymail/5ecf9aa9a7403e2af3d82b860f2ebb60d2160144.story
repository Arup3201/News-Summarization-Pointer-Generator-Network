At the start of the season two teams dominated most predictions for the Premier League. Yet one of them has probably surpassed expectations and is shaping up to be one of the great Premier League sides, the other is well below par.

I am, of course, referring to Chelsea and Manchester City and last week’s action in the Champions League provided a summary of their domestic form. Chelsea were superb but it is the team that impresses. City just got there in the end but only Sergio Aguero is really delivering.

When you analyse where it is going wrong for City, there are some obvious areas. Yaya Toure clearly isn’t the player he was last season, for whatever reason. We can’t know for sure but it might have been the loss of his brother, who tragically died in the summer. It certainly seems to have gone downhill ever since there was that silly row about his birthday after the summer trip to Abu Dhabi. Only now are some people realising quite how important he was to the whole team.

Chelsea have been hugely impressive in the Premier League this season, and are still unbeaten 

But Premier League champions Manchester City, and particularly Yaya Toure, have been disappointing

David Silva was also in sensational form last season but he’s been injured of late and hasn’t quite hit the heights of last season. For me, those two were the heart of the midfield; exceptional players who, with Aguero in front of them, made the difference. Jesus Navas and Samri Nasri look like players who come alive when the rest of the team are playing well.

Up front, Edin Dzeko has missed some games through injury and hasn’t shared the scoring burden, with only two goals in the Premier League and don’t forget they haven’t got Alvaro Negredo. They let him go after his form tailed off in the closing months of last season but by this stage last year he had already scored 12 goals for City; seven in the League.

Last week they were very fortunate to stay in the Champions League with CSKA Moscow’s last-minute goal and Bayern going down to 10 men. A lot of things happened to keep them in the frame. It won’t be like that if they make the last 16 — they will have to earn wins the hard way.

Pellegrini won both the league and League Cup in his first season but looks unlikely to repeat that feat

Jose Mourinho's Chelsea side are capable of going toe-to-toe with the best sides in European football 

It’s going to be difficult for City to spend their way out of this downturn, as they have in the past. It looks as though they have been caught out a little by the severity with which UEFA imposed their Financial Fair Play rules. Possibly there was a feeling that if they did stumble a little bit, they could go out to buy somebody. Now the rules have changed so that is a difficulty.

Of course, they still have an incredible squad and resources so I wouldn’t feel too sorry for them but they have to watch what they spend in January or at least balance the books.

Chelsea did that magnificently in the summer, even making a profit on their dealings. For me, the biggest change there is that you can see Jose Mourinho’s hand in all the transfers. There was a suspicion in the past that it wasn’t necessarily football people making the decisions about who should be bought, certainly not when Fernando Torres came in.

But all the major transfers since Mourinho has arrived have brought balance to the team and added quality. The players who have made the difference this season have been Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas, Nemanja Matic, who was signed in January, and Thibaut Courtois, who returned from his loan in Spain. All that was done by the manager. 

He’s moulded the team into what he wanted. Reading between the lines, it seems as though Jose appreciated what the owner, Roman Abramovich, wanted in terms of more stylish football, while the owner appreciates what Mourinho brings to the side. Their partnership fits hand in glove. Chelsea can be sensational to watch even if, like at Sunderland, they can also be quite tight and just take what’s on offer. Their work ethic allows individuality to thrive.

You can’t see this Chelsea side not winning the Premier League title, only injuries to key players might stop them. What will be intriguing is how they fare when the Champions League resumes in February. I know they won the tournament in 2012 playing on the counter-attack but in reality we haven’t really had a team in England in recent years who could genuinely go toe-to-toe with Europe’s very best. Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Barcelona are certainly the strongest at the moment. If Chelsea can maintain this kind of form, they might just be the team to challenge those giants.
