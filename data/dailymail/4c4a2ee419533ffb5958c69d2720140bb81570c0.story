A New Mexico middle school teacher has quit her job and is lashing out at her school district after she claims she was threatened and bullied by her students.

Sharon Moran, 47, retired from McKinley Middle School in Albuquerque last week after getting a death threat from on of her students. 

The Michigan State University graduate has worked as a teacher for 12 years, but felt she couldn't continue due to the hostile environment at the school. 

Sharon Moran, 47, says she retired because a middle school student threatened her life while she was teaching

The death threat was the final straw in Moran's decision to quit, KOAT reported. 

Administrators from Albuquerque Public Schools did not respond 'correctly to the threat that was made', according to Moran. 

She said: 'I do feel like I'm being intimidated and I feel like I'm bullied.

'I had to kind of evaluate every day what kind of situation I'm going into every day and whether or not I'm safe.

'My family is concerned for my safety.

'They worry about me and I think I did the right thing.' 

In an earlier incident at McKinley, a male teacher, 71, was hurt while breaking up a fight between two students

During an incident at McKinley earlier this year, a 71-year-old male teacher was hurt while breaking up a fight between two students.

Vincent Criscuola, a special education teacher, was punched and thrown into a wall during the incident.  

Criscuola had to take time off after suffering a spinal strain, a neck sprain and a hip injury. 

However, he did decide to return to the school despite admitting, 'I don't feel safe there'.

He said: 'It just upsets me. 

'We're there to teach and take care of these kids and watch out for their safety.' 

The principal and vice principal at McKinley have not responded to a request for comment.
