The recent arrest of Sinaloa drug cartel kingpin Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman means the next man in line will be expected to stand up - and now he may have been identified.

Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada, 66, and from the same rural area of Mexico as El Chapo, is a close confidant of the jailed drug lord, and is considered to be the brains behind the operation.

'He is everything,' a US official told the Los Angeles Times. 'The brains. The logistics. Security. Everything.' Guzman was seen by officials as the muscle.

The longer-term fate of a criminal ring 
likened to an international corporation is anything but clear, as 
authorities pursue other top leaders and weaker rivals dream of moving 
in - but Zambada seems firmly in control, at least for now.

Zambada is less flashy, according to a Times profile, but is still known to law enforcement - US officials have long offered a $5million reward for information leading to his capture.

The rural farmer is well entrenched in the Sinaloa cartel, according to a 2010 profile in Proceso cited by the Times. He is respected by those both inside and outside of the organization - which is likely key to keeping it together.

He and Guzman grew up together in rural Mexico and rose through the ranks of the cartel together, an official told the Times.

Zambada told Proceso that he and El Chapo are 'compadres' who 'talk on the phone regularly,' the case for him being placed at the top even if he doesÂ  not want the title.

'Everything indicates that El Mayo Zambada will stay at the front of the organization. What's less clear is whether, with the detention of [El Chapo], his business model will come to an end,' an official told the Times.

Zambada prefers to hold back on drug supplies instead of flooding the market, an easy way to drive up both demand and prices, as well as influence.

El Mayo is also violent, but much less out in the open, according to the Times. He prefers to single out victims instead of leave the mass graves that have become a Sinaloa cartel hallmark in recent years.

A DEA official who spoke on the condition
 of anonymity to discuss specific details of Guzman's arrest in Mexico 
said the agency doesn't anticipate that Guzman's absence will have an 
immediate effect on cartel operations because it has evolved from a gang
 into a worldwide organization.

The operation did not touch the cartel's immense political power, nurtured through the bribery of corrupt officials, or its thriving money laundering operations.

'As long as these other structures remain in place, all things being equal, Sinaloa will be able to continue to operate if not as normal, at least as the most powerful criminal organization in Mexico,'  said David Shirk, director of the University of San Diego's Justice in Mexico Project.

Guzman, who made Forbes magazine's lists of billionaires and most powerful people, was first among equals with Zambada and Juan Jose Esparragoza, known as "El Azul," both of whom remain at large.

Guzman worked closely with Zambada. Guillermo Valdes, former head of Mexico's top domestic intelligence agency, said the pair shared a clear vision, not only with respect to their adversaries but also with their business plan for trafficking cocaine, marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine in some 54 countries.

In other recent takedowns of major cartels, the Mexican government had to hit more than one leader before the organizations were dismantled or scattered into smaller gangs. One by one, the Arellano Felix brothers in Tijuana were arrested or killed over the last decade, as were the Beltran Leyva brothers from 2008 to 2011.

Though the Mexican marines killed Zeta leader Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano in October 2012, the power of the group did not diminish until the other leader, Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, was arrested last summer.

Despite the continuity provided by having El Mayo at the top, some predict Sinaloa is about to suffer the same fate.

U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul, who chairs the House Committee on Homeland Security, said to expect more arrests because authorities penetrated the cartel's communications system in catching Guzman.

'Our ability to crack their code will not bode well for their future,' he said, comparing Guzman's capture to the 1993 killing of Pablo Escobar of Colombia's Medellin cartel, once a powerful criminal organization. Its demise helped grow cartels such as Sinaloa.

When Escobar fell, "'he cartels started to unravel.'

In fact, some fear Guzman's capture could spark more violence, though no Mexican cartels seem strong enough at the moment to make a major play.

Long known to officials: El Mayo has operated out of the public spotlight, but has long been under scrutiny

Sinaloa's main rivals, the Zetas, have been substantially weakened, and other groups have become too local to rival Guzman's international reach.

Since Guzman escaped from a Mexican prison in 2001, he grew his cartel to be one of the largest in the world, with tentacles extending from Argentina to Australia.

Nobody outside the cartel leadership knows the extent of its power or business, but estimates are that Sinaloa handles 25 to 45 percent of all drugs entering the United States, with revenues around $3 billion a year. Last year, Forbes named Guzman the world's 67th most powerful person, between U.S. Speaker of the House John Boehner and New York Times Executive Editor Jill Abramson.

Sinaloa is believed to operate with an extended network of officials and lookouts on the payroll, especially in the western Mexico state for which the cartel is named. Both a state and federal police chief have been arrested for alleged ties to Sinaloa or its allies, only to later be released. When the Mexican marines mounted their offensive on Saturday, it was without alerting any local law enforcement.

'Local and state authorities are in the service of the Sinaloa cartel,' Valdez said.

Even though the long-term fate of Sinaloa is unclear, everyone agrees on the bottom line: The drugs will still continue to flow, even with the takedown of other Mexican cartels.

'In drug trafficking, as long as there is demand, there will be a supply,' Valdes said. 'It's like energy. You can't create or destroy it. It only transforms.'
