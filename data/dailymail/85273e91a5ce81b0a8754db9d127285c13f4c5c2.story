Liverpool's anthem 'You'll Never Walk Alone' played at the Golden Shoe award ceremony at Barcelona on Wednesday night as Luis Suarez dedicated the prize to his former team-mates.

'My three-and-a-half years there were spectacular and I would not have won this without them,' he said. 'I would also like to thank the man who who brought me to the club,' he added, looking across at Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish, who was in Barcelona to present him with the award.

'From the first moment I met him with Sofia [Suarez's wife] I took to him,' said Dalglish. 'He achieved so much last season and it's an honour to be here - I even cancelled a game of golf to make it.'

Suarez is set to make his return to competitive action  against Real Madrid on October 25

Dalglish was asked if he thought Suarez would succeed and he said: 'I don't think there is anyone who can stop him. He was brilliant at Ajax and Liverpool and I'm sure he will be success. And if it doesn't work out he can always come back to Liverpool on loan.'

In a video message Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard said: 'Good luck for the future mate we wish you well. Thanks for everything you did last season for us. Barcelona are very lucky to have you.' 

It was the Barcelona forward's wish that Gerrard be at the presentation but he was unable to travel.

Suarez scored 31 goals last season and he said after the presentation that he was ready to start in the Clasico clash against Real Madrid on October 25 if picked.

'Every player has to be prepared to play every game - I feel good. Maybe if you had asked me two weeks ago the answer would not have been the same, but after the two friendlies with Uruguay I am very happy with the condition I am in. I feel a lot better than - thought I would.' 

Suarez returned to action for Uruguay in a friendly 1-1 draw against Saudi Arabia in Jiddah on October 10

The former Ajax striker followed that up with a couple of goals in a 3-0 friendly win over Oman on October 13

Suarez and Dalglish were reunited as the former Liverpool manager flew to Spain to present the award

Dalglish signed Suarez for Liverpool in 2011 and he was a success in his time at Anfield

Dalglish had a close bond with Suarez at Liverpool and staunchly defended his former charge when he was found guilty of racially abusing Patrice Evra. 

Liverpool's next home game is against Hull on October 25 but their former star will hope to be busy that day as Barcelona travel to the Santiago Bernabeu for the Clasico.

Lionel Messi, Suarez's Barcelona team-mate, has won the Golden Shoe in the last two seasons.

The Uruguyan actually shares the honour this time with Cristiano Ronaldo, who also scored 31 goals last season.

Suarez's haul enabled him to beat the previous record for one season at Liverpool, beating Robbie Fowler, who scored 28 goals in 1995-96.
