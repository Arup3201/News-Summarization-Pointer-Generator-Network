British royal Peter Phillips took his family out on the hottest day of the year yesterday to watch his younger sister Zara compete in the Barbury International Horse trials on Sharpridge Farm.

While his giggling baby daughter Isla was content enough in her pram, his eldest Savannah, 3, had bounds of energy as she was swung high in the air by her mother Autumn.

The joyous toddler even made a run for freedom at one point, forcing her father to dash after her.

Meanwhile Autumn chatted to their companion and tended to Isla at the event near Swindon.

The two little girls were wearing white frilly sun hats and pretty dresses in pink and purple.

 Isla enjoyed the hot weather barefoot from the comfort of her pushchair
 while her older sister ran around in black Mary Jane flats.

Dressed in casual summer clothes, Peter 
wore a pastel shirt and beige cargo shorts while wife Autumn dressed in 
cropped skinny jeans a loose grey top.

Peter Phillips and Autumn have been married for five years and have two daughters together.

The four-day horse riding competition comprises of dressage, show jumping and cross country.
